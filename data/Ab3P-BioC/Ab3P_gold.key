A BioC-complaint version of the Ab3P application is distributed as part of the BioC-C++ package in bioc.sourceforge.net 

The collection was reviewed and revised by four annotators as part of the work in:

collection:  1250 random PubMed documents with ASCII text

source:  PubMed

date:  yyyymmdd. Date documents downloaded from PubMed

document:  Title and possibly abstract from a PubMed reference

id:  PubMed id

passage:  Either title or abstract

infon["type"]:  "title" or "abstract"

offset: The original Unicode byte offsets were not updated after
            the ASCII conversion.

PubMed is extracted from an XML file, so literal offsets would not be useful. Title has an offset of zero, while the abstract is assumed to begin after the title and one space. These offsets at least sequence the abstract after the title.

annotation:  Abbreviations

id:  sequential integers from 0 prefixed by either 'SF' or 'LF'

infon["type"]:  "ABBR"

infon["ABBR"]:  "ShortForm" or "LongForm"

location:  offset: A document offset to where the annotated text
                       begins in the passage or sentence. 

           length: The length of the annotated text.

text:  Original text of the short form or long form.

relation:  Long form / short form pair
    
infon["type"]:  "ABBR"

id:  sequential integers from 0 prefixed by 'R'

node:  
        role: "ShortForm" or "LongForm"

        refid:  id of the appropriate annotation
