Abbreviation key

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Collection notes: 

Abbreviation short forms and long forms are annotated in the corpus used for development of Schwartz and Hearst algorithm in:

A Simple Algorithm for Identifying Abbreviation Definitions in Biomedical Text, Ariel Schwartz and Marti Hearst, in the proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB 2003) Kauai, Jan 2003. 

A BioC-compliant version of the Schwartz and Hearst algorithm is distributed as part of the BioC-JAVA package at bioc.sourceforge.net 

The collection was reviewed and revised by four annotators as part of the work in: 

Finding Abbreviations in Biomedical Literature: Three BioC-Compatible Modules and Four BioC-formatted Corpora. Rezarta Islamaj Dog?an, Donald C. Comeau, Lana Yeganova and W. John Wilbur. Database. 2014.
