Grab is a utility program in macOS for taking screenshots. It supports capturing a marquee selection, a whole window, and the whole screen, as well as timed screenshots.

It may be quickly opened by using the Spotlight function when entering "grab", or by pressing and typing "/Applications/Utilities/Grab.app" in application Finder. It was previously also found in the Finder menu under "Services" > "Grab".
