Kraus–Weber test

The Kraus–Weber test (or K–W test) is a fitness test devised by Hans Kraus and Sonja Weber of New York Presbyterian Hospital.

The Kraus–Weber test involved six simple movements and took 90 seconds to administer. Some early studies using this test were performed by Bonnie Prudden. In 1940s and 1950s, she applied this test to students in her conditioning classes. To her surprise the new students failed the test at 58% while the students who had been in the program failed at only 8%. Over a period of seven years, Prudden and her volunteers tested 4,458 children between the ages of 6 and 16 in the United States. The failure rate was 56.6%. While climbing in Europe, Prudden and Kraus arranged to test children in Europe. In Italy, Austria and Switzerland, the children tested exhibited an eight percent failure rate.

In 1952, Prudden and Kraus began writing papers for medical and physical education journals concerning their findings on "Hypokinetic Disease: Role of Inactivity in Production of Disease" and various media outlets began to pick up the story.

In 1955, armed with statistics and a personal invitation to the Eisenhower White House, Bonnie Prudden presented her findings on the fitness level of American public school children compared to that of their peers in Europe. This became known as "The Report that Shocked the President" or the "Shape of the Nation".

The six exercises involved in the test are:
