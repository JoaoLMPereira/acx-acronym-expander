GolfBOO

GolfBOO is a golf course search engine, optimized towards finding golf courses and online bargains. Co-founded in 2013 by Antonio Conde and Fabio Peral and headquartered in Marbella, Spain, the engine provides a search tool to find locations, descriptions, facility list, and reviews on golf courses in Europe.

GolfBOO is a golf course search engine that locates golf courses, golf vacation travel packages, and real estate options. The website uses algorithms and a rating system as search filters.

GolfBOO was founded in January 2013 by Antonio Conde, an online marketer, and Fabio Peral, a former golf consultant at Royal Troon Golf Club, and golf director at La Quinta, Lumine and Buenaventura, located in Panama. 
The first version of the website was launched in June 2013. The former version of the site focused on advertised golf courses and golf bargain packages. Later on, the site expanded into listing tee times, hotels deals, and real estate located in specific golfing spots.

GolfBOO received online exposure during the initial debut due to the fact that it is the only golf-specific travel search engine and comparison website. It was the first travel website to curtail its search optimization towards finding real estate in golf recreational areas.
