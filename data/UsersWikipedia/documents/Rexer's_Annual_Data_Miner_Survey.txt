Rexer's Annual Data Miner Survey

Rexer Analytics’s Annual Data Miner Survey is the largest survey of data mining, data science, and analytics professionals in the industry. It consists of approximately 50 multiple choice and open-ended questions that cover seven general areas of data mining science and practice: (1) Field and goals, (2) Algorithms, (3) Models, (4) Tools (software packages used), (5) Technology, (6) Challenges, and (7) Future. It is conducted as a service (without corporate sponsorship) to the data mining community, and the results are usually announced at the PAW (Predictive Analytics World) conferences and shared via freely available summary reports. In the 2013 survey, 1259 data miners from 75 countries participated. After 2011, Rexer Analytics moved to a biannual schedule.
