ProCurve Products

HP ProCurve was the name of the networking division of Hewlett-Packard from 1998 to 2010 and associated with the products that it sold. The name of the division was changed to HP Networking in September 2010. Please use HP Networking Products for an actual list of products.

The HP ProCurve division sold network switches, wireless access points, WAN routers, and Access Control Servers/Software under the "HP ProCurve" brand name.








German company .vantronix marketed software products until 2009.

Due to country laws, ProCurve released different versions of their wireless access points and MultiService Access points.

The MSM Access and Mobility Controllers support security, roaming and quality of service across MSM Access Points utilising 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless technology.

Most access points are designed to work in controlled mode: a controller manages and provides authentication services for them.
