20230140,"Predicting conversion to dementia of the Alzheimer's type in a healthy control sample: the power of errors in Stroop color naming.In the present study, we investigated which cognitive functions in older adults at Time A are predictive of conversion to dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) at Time B. Forty-seven healthy individuals were initially tested in 1992-1994 on a trial-by-trial computerized Stroop task along with a battery of psychometric measures that tap general knowledge, declarative memory, visual-spatial processing, and processing speed. Twelve of these individuals subsequently developed DAT. The errors on the color incongruent trials (along with the difference between congruent and incongruent trials) and changes in the reaction time distributions were the strongest predictors of conversion to DAT, consistent with recent arguments regarding the sensitivity of these measures. Notably in the psychometric measures, there was little evidence of a difference in declarative memory between converters and nonconverters, but there was some evidence of changes in visual-spatial processing. Discussion focuses on the accumulating evidence suggesting a role of attentional control mechanisms as an early marker for the transition from healthy cognitive aging to DAT.",M1
20220576,"Methylphenidate for apathy and functional status in dementia of the Alzheimer type.OBJECTIVE: Apathy is the most common behavioral problem in persons with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Treatment of apathy in DAT is not systematically studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of apathy to methylphenidate treatment and to examine whether functional status improved. METHODS: The authors conducted a 12-week open-labeled study with immediate release formulation of methylphenidate. Twenty-three patients with DAT scoring &gt;40 on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) were recruited. Repeated measures analysis of variance and correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS: None of the patients dropped out of the study because of adverse events. Significant improvement in apathy was noted during 12 weeks. Significant improvement was also noted in depression, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and functional status. There was no correlation between changes in the AES and depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate was well tolerated in these patients with DAT. Apathy improved with the use of methylphenidate.",M1
20215096,"[What use of biological markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and associated disorders?]Etiological diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia requires combined clinical, neuropsychological, biological and neuro-imaging clues. The diagnostic value of biological and neuro-imaging biomarkers has recently increased according to neuropathological studies. Biomarkers help for making the in vivo diagnosis of underlying histological lesions, sometimes of combined lesions. Sensitivity and specificity of CSF biomarkers, i.e. tau, phospho-tau and amyloid, is now over 85% for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis at the dementia and MCI stages. Brain MRI can suggest mild AD when depicting medial temporal lobe atrophy. <e>DAT</e>-SCAN(R) is indicated in cases suspected to have Lewy body dementia when parkinsonism is lacking. Metabolism and blood flow impairments observed by PET and SPECT in posterior cortical areas, in particular in posterior cingulate and parieto-temporo-occipital junction, are highly suggestive of AD in atypical cases. International research is currently focalised on research of possible serum biomarkers and neuro-imaging techniques using tracers targeting the specific AD lesions.",M1
20102379,"Changes in cognitive functions of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type following long-term administration of donepezil hydrochloride: relating to changes attributable to differences in apolipoprotein E phenotype.AIM: We conducted a study of changes in cognitive functions by long-term monitoring of dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) patients to investigate the relationship between the progression of DAT symptoms and the presence of apolipoprotein (ApoE)4. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 40 DAT patients who had been treated with donepezil for 3 years or more. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog), were conducted annually. The patients were categorized into ApoE4(+) and ApoE4(-) groups. Changes in initial cognitive function assessment score (0 years) were then studied longitudinally at each stage of the observation period (1, 2, 3 years) (Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Moreover, the scores at each time period were compared cross-sectionally between the two groups (Mann-Whitney U-test). RESULTS: Significant decreases in MMSE scores were observed at the three time periods in both groups (P &lt; 0.01) in the cross-sectional study. In the longitudinal study, the ApoE4(+) group demonstrated a lower trend (P &lt; 0.1) after 1 year only. Significantly poorer ADAS-Jcog scores were observed in the ApoE4(+) group at the 3-year point both in the longitudinal and in the cross-sectional study (P &lt; 0.05). For ADAS-Jcog sub-items, in the longitudinal study, orientation was demonstrated to be significantly poorer in the ApoE4(+) group in the third year (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: ApoE4 was suggested to not only be a risk factor for disease onset, but also a risk factor for exacerbation of symptoms with respect to long-term prognosis.",M1
20083211,"Automated 3D mapping of baseline and 12-month associations between three verbal memory measures and hippocampal atrophy in 490 ADNI subjects.We used a previously validated automated machine learning algorithm based on adaptive boosting to segment the hippocampi in baseline and 12-month follow-up 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs of 150 cognitively normal elderly (NC), 245 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 97 Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) ADNI subjects. Using the radial distance mapping technique, we examined the hippocampal correlates of delayed recall performance on three well-established verbal memory tests--ADAScog delayed recall (ADAScog-DR), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test -DR (AVLT-DR) and Wechsler Logical Memory II-DR (LM II-DR). We observed no significant correlations between delayed recall performance and hippocampal radial distance on any of the three verbal memory measures in NC. All three measures were associated with hippocampal volumes and radial distance in the full sample and in the MCI group at baseline and at follow-up. In DAT we observed stronger left-sided associations between hippocampal radial distance, LM II-DR and ADAScog-DR both at baseline and at follow-up. The strongest linkage between memory performance and hippocampal atrophy in the MCI sample was observed with the most challenging verbal memory test-the AVLT-DR, as opposed to the DAT sample where the least challenging test the ADAScog-DR showed strongest associations with the hippocampal structure. After controlling for baseline hippocampal atrophy, memory performance showed regionally specific associations with hippocampal radial distance in predominantly CA1 but also in subicular distribution.",M1
20065136,"Donepezil treatment and changes in hippocampal structure in very mild Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVE: To compare longitudinal changes in the hippocampal structure in subjects with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) treated with donepezil hydrochloride, untreated subjects with very mild DAT, and controls without dementia. DESIGN: MPRAGE sequences were collected approximately 2 years apart on two 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging systems, yielding 2 cohorts. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping was used to compute deformation of hippocampal subfields. SETTING: A dementia clinic at Washington University School of Medicine. Patients or Other PARTICIPANTS: Subjects came from 2 sources: 18 untreated subjects with DAT and 26 controls were drawn from a previous longitudinal study; 18 treated subjects with DAT were studied prospectively, and 44 controls were drawn from a longitudinal study from the same period. Intervention Patients were prescribed donepezil by their physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hippocampal volume loss and surface deformation. RESULTS: There was no significant cohort effect at baseline; therefore, the 2 groups of control subjects were combined. The potential confounding effect of cohort/scanner was dealt with by including it as a covariate in statistical tests. There was no significant group effect in the rate of change of hippocampal volume or subfield deformation. Further exploration showed that compared with the untreated subjects with DAT, the treated subjects with DAT did not differ in the rate of change in any of the hippocampal measures. They also did not differ from the controls, while the untreated subjects with DAT differed from the controls in the rates of change of hippocampal volume and CA1 and subiculum subfield deformations. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with donepezil did not alter the progression of hippocampal deformation in subjects with DAT in this study. Small sample size may have contributed to this outcome.",M1
20063946,"The utility of placing recollection in opposition to familiarity in early discrimination of healthy aging and very mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type.This study explored the ability to control familiarity-based information in a memory exclusion paradigm in healthy young, older adults, and early stage <e>DAT</e> individuals. We compared the predictive power of memory exclusion performance to standard psychometric performance in discriminating between aging and the earliest stage of DAT and between APOe4-present and APOe4-absent genotype in healthy control individuals. Participants responded  yes  to words that were previously semantically encoded, and  no  to words that were previously read aloud and to new words. The number of targets and distractors on the read  distractor  list was manipulated to investigate the degree to which aging and DAT influence the ability to recollect in the face of distractor familiarity due to repetition. Memory exclusion performance was better for healthy older adults than very mild DAT individuals and better for healthy control individuals with APOe4 allele than those without APOe4 allele even after controlling for standard psychometric performance. Discussion focuses on the importance of attentional control systems in memory retrieval and the utility of the opposition paradigm for discriminating healthy versus pathological aging.",M1
20008650,"Pittsburgh compound B imaging and prediction of progression from cognitive normality to symptomatic Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD), as detected by the amyloid-imaging agent Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) in cognitively normal older adults, is associated with risk of symptomatic AD. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study of cognitively normal older adults assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) to determine the mean cortical binding potential for PiB and followed up with annual clinical and cognitive assessments for progression to very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-nine participants with a mean age of 71.5 years with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 on a PET PiB scan at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5 status (very mild dementia). RESULTS: Twenty-three participants progressed to CDR 0.5 at follow-up assessment (range, 1-5 assessments after PET PiB). Of these, 9 also were diagnosed with DAT. Higher mean cortical binding potential values for PiB (hazard ratio, 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-19.01; P = .02) and age (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.28; P = .03) predicted progression to CDR 0.5 DAT. The CDR 0.5 DAT group showed decline in 3 cognitive domains (episodic memory, semantic memory, and visuospatial performance) and had volume loss in the parahippocampal gyrus (includes entorhinal cortex) compared with individuals who remained at CDR 0. CONCLUSION: Preclinical AD as detected by PET PiB is not benign, as it is associated with progression to symptomatic AD.",M1
20003864,"[Adverse events causing discontinuation of donepezil for Alzheimer's dementia]INTRODUCTION: The objective was to investigate the frequency of adverse events (AE) as a cause for discontinuation of donepezil treatment for Alzheimer's dementia (<e>DAT</e>) in a geriatric memory unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five-year retrospective study of 123 donepezil-treated patients diagnosed with DAT or mixed dementia in a geriatric memory unit. The material covers all patients treated with donepezil and surveyed for 12 months in the memory unit during the period from 14th March 2001 to 7th April 2006. RESULTS: Among the 123 patients, 106 (86%) suffered from DAT and 17 (14%) suffered from mixed dementia. A total of 100 (81%) were female while 23 (19%) were male. The median age was 84 years. In all, 26 (21%) patients discontinued treatment due to AE. The most frequent AE were nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea and loss of appetite. CONCLUSION: In 21% of the cases treatment was discontinued within 12 months due to AE. The most frequent AEs were nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea and loss of appetite. For the most part discontinuation took place within the initial three months. However, some treatments were not discontinued until after six months; consequently, treatment should be supervised and patients should have easy access to a memory unit in the case of AE.",M1
19907013,"CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease in HIV-associated neurologic disease.BACKGROUND: HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) continue to develop in many patients with HIV. CSF amyloid measurements in HAND have been reported to be similar to those in dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Confirmatory evaluation of this finding in carefully evaluated subjects is needed. METHODS: CSF specimens were obtained from subjects clinically categorized with normal cognition from the general population, HIV+ subjects with normal cognition, HIV+ subjects with impaired cognition, or presumed HIV- subjects with mild DAT. CSF measurements of beta-amyloid((1-42)) (Abeta42), beta-amyloid((1-40)) (Abeta40), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) were performed. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 measured in 49 HAND subjects had a median level of 501 pg/mL, which was lower than that of 50 controls of similar age who had median of 686 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.0001) or 21 HIV+ subjects without cognitive impairment who had median of 716 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.003). HAND subjects had similar CSF Abeta42 to 68 subjects with mild DAT. There was no difference of CSF Abeta40 between the groups. Tau and p-tau181 was elevated in DAT, but slightly lower than control in both HIV+ groups. CONCLUSIONS: beta-Amyloid((1-42)) (Abeta42) measurements in CSF of cognitively impaired patients with HIV are similar to those in patients with mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Normal or slightly depressed CSF tau and p-tau181 measurements distinguish these patients with HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) from patients with DAT. Further evaluation of amyloid metabolism in patients with HIV cognitive disorder is needed to understand the implications of depressed CSF Abeta42 in the setting of HAND.",M1
19899833,"The utility of intraindividual variability in selective attention tasks as an early marker for Alzheimer's disease.This study explored differences in intraindividual variability in 3 attention tasks across a large sample of healthy older adults and individuals with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). Three groups of participants (healthy young adults, healthy older adults, very mild DAT) were administered 3 experimental measures of attentional selection and switching (Stroop, Simon, task switching). The results indicated that a measure of intraindividual variability, coefficient of variation (CoV; SD/M), increased across age and early stage DAT. The CoV in Stroop discriminated the performance of epsilon4 carriers from noncarriers in healthy older controls and the CoV in task switching was correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers predictive of DAT.",M1
19847049,"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with [18F]PET in mild and asymptomatic stages.With longer life expectancy, dementia based on the age-related Alzheimers' disease (AD) has turned into one of the most prevalent disorders of older age, representing a serious medical and socio-economic issue. There has been growing interest in early diagnosis of this disease, particularly regarding the initiation of new treatment strategies ahead of the onset of irreversible neuronal damage. It is accepted that the pathologic changes underlying AD appear in the brain years to decades before the symptomatic stages. Consequently, clinical measures of cognitive impairment, as used for definition of dementia, will not allow early diagnosis of AD-pathology in the mild or asymptomatic stages. Thus, a need for complementary sensitive biomarkers is apparent. Brain imaging markers are among the most promising candidates for this diagnostic challenge. Particularly, [18F]FDG PET as a marker of regional neuronal function has been demonstrated to represent a most sensitive and specific method for early identification of AD-pathology and thus for prediction of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>), even in the mild and asymptomatic stages. Currently, systematic data of comparable quality are hardly available for any other imaging procedure. The purpose of this article is to describe the typical findings of [18F]FDG PET in different stages of AD and to demonstrate its value for early and reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly ahead of the stage of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",M1
19747161,"Intracranial MR dynamics in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease: the emerging concept of  pulse wave encephalopathy .As increasingly shown in neuropathological and predementia clinical studies, cognitive decline with altered intracranial dynamics can fulfill current clinical criteria of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and there is a marked pathogenic complexity of this epidemic syndrome. Whereas structural studies only suggest the unexpected frequency of cerebrovascular changes in late life DAT, flow quantification MR sequences now offer a great opportunity of in vivo accurate analysis of cerebrovascular function. Their first applications have allowed development of a modern concept of the intracranial dynamics; a complex windkessel system allows two processes that are crucial to insure brain oxygenation and nutrition, a periodic systolic marked expansion of the intracranial blood compartment within the rigid cranial cavity on the one hand, a marked dampening of the arterial pulse wave before it reaches capillary level on the other hand. This modern concept has allowed better understanding of two archetypes of windkessel failure or so-called pulse wave encephalopathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus and subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. Dynamic MRI may now help to detect and classify distinct patterns of cerebrovascular dysfunction in DAT. This dynamic approach helps to understand the major association between aging and DAT as well as the increasingly recognized overlap between Alzheimer's pathology, normal pressure hydrocephalus and arteriosclerotic neurodegeneration. Evidence of such a great variety of disturbances in intracranial dynamics behind a single clinical syndrome of DAT can greatly impact therapeutic research on this devastating disorder.",M1
19673804,"Emotional recognition from face, voice, and music in dementia of the Alzheimer type.Persons with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) are impaired in recognizing emotions from face and voice. Yet clinical practitioners use these mediums to communicate with DAT patients. Music is also used in clinical practice, but little is known about emotional processing from music in DAT. This study aims to assess emotional recognition in mild DAT. Seven patients with DAT and 16 healthy elderly adults were given three tasks of emotional recognition for face, prosody, and music. DAT participants were only impaired in the emotional recognition from the face. These preliminary results suggest that dynamic auditory emotions are preserved in DAT.",M1
19666883,"Thyroid medication use and subsequent development of dementia of the Alzheimer type.Associations between medication use and the development of Alzheimer disease have been investigated since the late 1900s. Thyroid hormone supplementation is rarely a studied medication class in this area of research. We examined data from participants enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center for associations between thyroid disease, thyroid hormone supplementation therapy, and subsequent development of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Data collected between April 1992 and June 2008 from 499 participants, 184 men and 315 women, were analyzed. Mean age was 76.9 years (SD = 9.2). At baseline, 61 participants reported thyroid medication use and 87 were identified as having a history of thyroid dysfunction. These participants progressed to a DAT diagnosis more rapidly than individuals not taking thyroid medication (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.67, 95% CI: 0.99-2.78, P = .054). Although an interesting trend was seen, baseline thyroid disease was not significantly (P = .093) associated with time to DAT diagnosis. Our findings suggest that utilization of thyroid medication may be associated with the development of DAT.",M1
19627423,"A validity study of the Working Group's Orientation Test for individuals with moderate to severe intellectual disability.BACKGROUND: Decline in orientation skill has been reported as an early indicator of Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (<e>DAT</e>). Orientation subtest of the Working Group's Test Battery was examined whether this test is useful to identify DAT patients among adults with moderate to severe ID. METHODS: Sixteen DAT patients and 35 non-demented normal controls with moderate to severe ID were followed for a year using Orientation Test. The scores on the baseline evaluation and the longitudinal changes over a 1-year period among the DAT patients and the normal controls were compared. The effects of age and etiologies of ID on the performance of Orientation were also examined. RESULTS: The DAT group's score was significantly poorer than that of the normal control group on the baseline evaluation. The score changes over the 1-year period were not significantly different between the groups. However, there was a considerable overlap between the score distributions of the two groups. The effects of age and etiologies of ID on the performance of Orientation were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Screening DAT patients based only on the score of the Orientation Test of the Working Group's Test Battery may produce a large number of diagnostic errors.",M1
19604328,"What is 'early onset dementia'?There are two types of dementia with early onset: (i) presenile dementias; and (ii) senile dementias with early onset. Most patients who develop dementia before 65 years of age have Alzheimer's disease (AD). The remainder are likely to have vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia, head injury, alcohol intoxication, or metabolic disorder. Presenile dementias, caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration, usually occur in patients of presenile and are rarely seen in patients of senile age. Although the factors responsible for the accelerated onset of the illness are not fully known, genetic abnormalities appear to be important in some types of presenile dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Conversely, senile dementias such as sporadic AD and VaD commonly occur in patients of senile age. These disorders may also occur in patients of presenile age, although less frequently. Alzheimer's disease was originally classified as a 'presenile dementia'. Since the 1980s, 'senile dementia of Alzheimer type' (SDAT) and 'Alzheimer's disease' have been considered to belong to the same pathological entity and both are now known as 'dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>)' or merely 'Alzheimer's disease'. Rapid progression of cognitive impairment with neuropsychological syndromes and neurological symptoms has been considered a characteristic of early onset AD. However, recently, neurological symptoms such as spastic paraparesis, seizures, and myoclonic convulsions have been reported to occur infrequently in early onset AD, although language problems and visuospatial dysfunctions are common. There are at least three dominant genes that have been identified in cases of familial Alzheimer's disease with early onset, namely the amyloid precursor gene (APP), and the genes encoding presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). Therefore, genetic abnormalities are important factors contributing to the earlier onset of the illness. It is also important to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism in relation to genetic abnormalities, environmental factors, physical illnesses, and metabolic disturbances to understand the processes underlying the development of dementia with early onset.",M1
19597092,"Apathy symptom profile and behavioral associations in frontotemporal dementia vs dementia of Alzheimer type.BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common and significant problem in patients with dementia, regardless of its cause. Observations about frontosubcortical circuit syndromes indicate that apathy may have affective, behavioral, or cognitive manifestations. OBJECTIVES: To explore whether the apathy manifested in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), with its predominantly anterior brain neuropathologic features, differs from the apathy in dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>), with its predominantly hippocampal- and temporoparietal-based neuropathologic features, and to determine whether other behavioral disturbances reported in frontosubcortical circuit syndromes correlate with apathy. DESIGN: Analyses included individual items within Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscale items. Items of the apathy/indifference subscale were designated by consensus as affective (lacking in emotions), behavioral (inactive, chores abandoned), or cognitive (no interest in the activities of others). Proportions of correlated nonapathy Neuropsychiatric Inventory items were calculated. SETTING: Several neurology specialty clinics contributed to our data set. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 92 participants with FTD and 457 with DAT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was analyzed. RESULTS: Apathy was more prevalent in patients with FTD than in those with DAT, but when present, the specific apathy symptoms associated with both types of dementia were rarely restricted to 1 of the 3 domains of apathy. Dysphoria concurrent with apathy was unique to the DAT group and negatively correlated in the FTD group. Participants with affective apathy more frequently copresented with an orbital frontosubcortical syndrome in FTD (impulsivity and compulsions). Affective apathy also copresented with uncooperative agitation, anger, and physical agitation in both types of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is common in patients with FTD and DAT, although it is more common in those with FTD. When present, it usually involves changes in affect, behavior, and cognition. It is associated with behaviors that have previously been shown to affect patient safety, independence, and quality of life.",M1
19501717,"The molecular and cellular pathogenesis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type an overview.The pathogenesis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) remains elusive. The neurodegeneration occurring in this disease has been traditionally believed to be the result of toxicity caused by the accumulation of insoluble amyloid-beta 42 (AB) aggregates, however recent research questions this thesis and has suggested other more convincing cellular and molecular mechanisms. Dysfunction of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, AB generation/aggregation and/or degredation/clearance, tau metabolism, protein trafficking, signal transduction, heavy metal homeostasis, acetylcholine and cholesterol metabolism, have all been implicated etiologically especially as to production of neurotoxic by-products occurring as a result of a specific process derangement. In this paper, these and other research directions are discussed as well as their implications for future therapies. The relationship of the proposed abnormal molecular and cellular processes to underlying genetic mutations is also scrutinized, all in an attempt to stimulate further insight into the pathogenesis of, and thus therapeutics for this increasingly prevalent disease.",M1
19473956,"[Long-term effect of a cognitive intervention on learning and participation in a significant leisure activity in early dementia of Alzheimer type: a case study]Decreased ability to accomplish significant leisure activities often occurs in early stages of dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). As a long term effect, it may eventually affect the quality of life of the patient as well as that of the caregiver's. In a previous study, a woman with early DAT (77 years old, MMSE: 24/30) improved her participation in 2 leisure activities (listening to music and praying in a group) following the learning of a few tasks (e.g. using a radio cassette, remembering the significance of an pre-programmed ring) as a result of a cognitive intervention. The present study presents the long term effect of this intervention on the retention of the learned tasks and on spontaneous participation in both leisure activities of her daily living. Measures of tasks' learning and spontaneous participation in activities have been obtained through direct observation (ex: ability to use the tasks learned without assistance) and telephone conversations with the caregiver. The measures were taken 9 to 15 months post-intervention. Nine months after the end of the intervention, the participant could no longer use the radio cassette, but was able to remember the significance of the pre-programmed ring. Similarly, she stopped listening to music, but still attended her prayer group. The intervention appears to maintain participation in a leisure activity for several months in a patient with early DAT, in spite of expected functional decline. This functional impact can be achieved through retention of specific learned tasks as well as by strong external cues (daily pre-programmed ring), and can increase the quality of life for patients with DAT.",M1
19433664,"Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and rate of cognitive decline in very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type.BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta peptide 1-42 (Abeta 42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau) are potential biomarkers of Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Abeta 42, tau, and ptau predict the rate of cognitive change in individuals with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of CSF biomarkers and clinical data. SETTING: An academic Alzheimer disease research center. PARTICIPANTS: Research volunteers in a longitudinal study of aging and cognition. Participants (n = 49) had a clinical diagnosis of very mild DAT with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 at the time of lumbar puncture. All the participants had at least 1 follow-up assessment (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.5 [1.8] years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline CSF levels of Abeta 42, Abeta 40, tau, and ptau at threonine 181 (ptau181) and the rate of dementia progression as measured using the CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score and psychometric performance. RESULTS: The rate of dementia progression was significantly more rapid in individuals with lower baseline CSF Abeta 42 levels, higher tau or ptau181 levels, or high tau: Abeta 42 ratios. For example, the annual change in the CDR-SB score was 1.1 for the lowest 2 tertiles of Abeta 42 values and 0.3 for the highest tertile of Abeta 42 values. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with very mild DAT, lower CSF Abeta 42 levels, high tau or ptau181 levels, or high tau:Abeta 42 ratios quantitatively predict more rapid progression of cognitive deficits and dementia. Biomarkers of CSF may be useful prognostically and to identify individuals who are more likely to progress for participation in therapeutic clinical trials.",M1
19268312,"Assessing cerebrovascular contribution to late dementia of the Alzheimer's type: the role of combined hemodynamic and structural MR analysis.The critical question as to the respective role of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease in dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>), the most common form of dementia, is still debated. But there has been considerable progress in understanding cerebral hemodynamics and the relationship between structural brain damage and cognitive decline, in routine neuro imaging techniques. These advances now allow the proposition of a novel MR classification of DAT including indicators of both cerebrovascular function and regional brain atrophy. MR indicators of windkessel function include the arterial pulsatility index, the intracranial blood stroke volume, the cerebral relative venous outflow rates and a relative index of craniospinal compliance. MR indicators of vascular conduct function include total arterial and superficial venous flow rates that are closely related to brain metabolism. Structural MR sequences allow the detection of structural markers of windkessel dysfunction and, beyond the non specific hippocampal atrophy, a more extensive AD-like MR pattern of atrophy. The first illustration of this MR classification in elderly patients that later progressed to dementia converges with recent neuropathological observations to suggest that the major enemy to combat in late-life dementia is not AD but cerebrovascular dysfunction.",M1
19210036,"Musical structural determinants of emotional judgments in dementia of the Alzheimer type.People with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) may well be emotionally soothed by listening to music. However, very few systematic studies have been conducted to support the anecdotal evidence. DAT does damage certain cerebral structures that subsume emotional processing, and some studies have demonstrated deficits affecting emotional judgments of facial expression and prosody in DAT. Accordingly, this study addressed the question of whether DAT might leave musical emotional judgment intact. Twelve early DAT participants and 12 healthy elderly participants took part in this study. Emotional judgments were examined in relation to mode and tempo, two important structural properties that contribute to the happy-sad distinction in music. Their respective contributions were assessed in four different experimental conditions. The DAT participants' responses were similar to those of healthy elderly participants, showing spared ability to employ tempo and mode as cues for emotional interpretation. The DAT participants' performance was not correlated with their global cognitive functioning. These results constitute a preliminary empirical demonstration that, in early DAT, musical emotional judgments appear to be based on normal structural analysis of musical input.",M1
19142633,"FDG-PET changes in brain glucose metabolism from normal cognition to pathologically verified Alzheimer's disease.PURPOSE: We report the first clinicopathological series of longitudinal FDG-PET scans in post-mortem (PM) verified cognitively normal elderly (NL) followed to the onset of Alzheimer's-type dementia (<e>DAT</e>), and in patients with mild DAT with progressive cognitive deterioration. METHODS: Four NL subjects and three patients with mild DAT received longitudinal clinical, neuropsychological and dynamic FDG-PET examinations with arterial input functions. NL subjects were followed for 13 +/- 5 years, received FDG-PET examinations over 7 +/- 2 years, and autopsy 6 +/- 3 years after the last FDG-PET. Two NL declined to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and two developed probable DAT before death. DAT patients were followed for 9 +/- 3 years, received FDG-PET examinations over 3 +/- 2 years, and autopsy 7 +/- 1 years after the last FDG-PET. Two DAT patients progressed to moderate-to-severe dementia and one developed vascular dementia. RESULTS: The two NL subjects who declined to DAT received a PM diagnosis of definite AD. Their FDG-PET scans indicated a progression of deficits in the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) from the hippocampus to the parietotemporal and posterior cingulate cortices. One DAT patient showed AD with diffuse Lewy body disease (LBD) at PM, and her last in vivo PET was indicative of possible LBD for the presence of occipital as well as parietotemporal hypometabolism. CONCLUSION: Progressive CMRglc reductions on FDG-PET occur years in advance of clinical DAT symptoms in patients with pathologically verified disease. The FDG-PET profiles in life were consistent with the PM diagnosis.",M1
19137294,"Cerebral perfusion (HMPAO-SPECT) in patients with depression with cognitive impairment versus those with mild cognitive impairment and dementia of Alzheimer's type: a semiquantitative and automated evaluation.PURPOSE: Comparative evaluation of regional brain perfusion measured by HMPAO-SPECT of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and depression with cognitive impairment (DCI). METHODS: A total of 736 patients were investigated because of suspected cognitive dysfunction. After exclusion of patients with other forms of dementia than DAT or relevant accompanying disorders, SPECT data from 149 MCI, 131 DAT and 127 DCI patients, and 123 controls without any cognitive impairment, were analysed. Relative cerebral blood flow of 34 anatomical regions was assessed with automated analysis software (BRASS). RESULTS: Calculation of global forebrain perfusion discriminated demented from nondemented patients. Compared to controls DCI patients showed hypoperfusion of the thalamus, lentiform nucleus and medial temporal cortex. MCI patients differed significantly from controls concerning perfusion in both hemispheric temporal and parietal areas, and in the (right hemispheric) posterior part of the cingulate gyrus. MCI and DCI patients differed in the parietal, temporal superior and right hemispheric cingulate gyrus posterior cortices. Global forebrain and regional perfusion was more extensively reduced in DAT patients and discriminated them from controls, and MCI and DCI patients. Frontal perfusion disturbance was only present in DAT patients. CONCLUSION: Automated analysis of HMPAO-SPECT data from MCI patients showed significant perfusion deficits in regions also involved in DAT patients, but ROC analysis demonstrated only moderate sensitivity and specificity for differentiating DAT patients from controls and DCI patients. Frontal hypoperfusion seems to correspond with conversion from MCI to DAT. Finally, the results in DCI patients again raise the question of depression as an early symptom of neurodegeneration.",M1
19073431,"Non-cognitive psychopathological symptoms associated with incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia, Alzheimer's type.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that specific psychopathological non-cognitive symptoms are associated with incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while different symptoms are associated with incident dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). METHODS: A representative community sample of 4,803 individuals aged 55+ years was interviewed in a two-phase screening, in Wave I or ZARADEMP I. This is the baseline, cross-sectional study of the ZARADEMP Project, a longitudinal study to document incidence and risk factors of dementia. The main instrument for assessment of participants was the ZARADEMP Interview, which includes standardized Spanish versions of instruments such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination and the Geriatric Mental State GMS-AGECAT. Two years later, in Wave II or ZARADEMP II, the cognitively non-deteriorated elderly were reassessed in a similar, two-phase procedure.  Incident cases  of both dementia and DAT (DSM-IV-TR criteria), as well as MCI (operationally defined Petersen's criteria) were diagnosed by a panel of psychiatrists. Statistical, logistic regression models, adjusted by age, sex and education were used to test the hypothesized association. RESULTS:  Irritability ,  neurovegetative symptoms ,  sleep problems ,  concentration difficulties ,  loneliness  and  subjective slowing  documented at baseline were associated with incident MCI (odds ratio, OR range 1.71-2.67). A different profile of non-cognitive symptoms was associated with incident DAT, specifically  tension  (OR= 2.45),  sleep problems  (OR= 2.81), and  observed slowing  (OR= 4.35). On the contrary,  subjective restriction of activities  seemed to be negatively associated with DAT (OR= 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report about some specific psychopathological, non-cognitive symptoms associated with incident MCI and/ or incident DAT, when controlling by each other. The psychopathological profile associated with MCI is different from the profile preceding DAT.",M1
18971872,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms and the progression of dementia of the Alzheimer type in nursing home residents.BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms are common in the course of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). Some behavioral and psychological symptoms may be predictors of the progression of dementia and cognitive impairment in DAT. However, studies on this topic face serious methodological problems. The aim of our study was to investigate how aggressive and impulsive behaviors correlate with the progression of dementia and related cognitive impairments in DAT patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: Using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the ADAS-cog we examined 39 nursing home residents diagnosed with mild to moderate DAT. Of these participants, 26 were re-evaluated with the ADAS-cog two years after baseline. RESULTS: Aggressive and impulsive behaviors correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. However, we also found that particular ADAS-cog items correlated differently with the CMAI score. Moreover, various CMAI categories were differently related to cognitive disorders. Impairments in cognitive functioning best explain the fluctuations of verbal aggression and physical agitation (non-aggressive). At baseline, the more demented subjects had a higher general score on the CMAI scale and showed greater rates of physical aggression, verbal aggression and non-aggressive physical agitation. CONCLUSIONS: Particular items of the CMAI scale significantly differentiated our subjects in terms of progression of cognitive impairment. Aggressive behaviors in patients with DAT are linked to both the severity of dementia and the rate of its progression. At the same time, significant differences were noted with respect to particular behaviors.",M1
18590798,"The relationship between depressive symptoms and prefrontal hypoperfusion demonstrated by eZIS in patients with <e>DAT</e>.Depressive symptoms are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to clinical morbidity. Previous studies have suggested that hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus are involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Using the easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS), we investigated the relationship between depressive symptoms and prefrontal hypoperfusion in AD. Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (Tc-99m-ECD)-single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were performed in forty-four patients diagnosed as having Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). These patients were divided into the depressive group (D group: n=26) and non-depressive group (ND group: n=18) using NPI depression items. All data from SPECT images were analyzed using eZIS software. Scores in four regions were determined by Z-values; these regions consisted of each side of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. The mean scores between the D group and ND group were compared. The mean scores of the left prefrontal cortex in the D group were significantly higher (p&lt;0.0125) than those in the ND group. There were no significant differences in the scores of the right prefrontal cortex and the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus between these two groups (Mann-Whitney U-test). These findings suggest that hypoperfusion in the left prefrontal area contributes to the expression of depressive symptoms in patients with DAT.",M1
18560129,"Risk factors for dementia of Alzheimer type and aging-associated cognitive decline in a Spanish population based sample, and in brains with pathology confirmed Alzheimer's disease.We investigated the environmental and genetic factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Spain and performed a door to door study of a cohort of more than 500 subjects, over 70 years old, from Leganés, a suburban area near Madrid. The cohort was followed for 6 years by neurologists and other health workers and was divided in three groups: normal controls, subjects with aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD) and probable AD or dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). Biological variables and polymorphisms of different genes, important in neurodegeneration or reported to be associated with AD, were investigated as putative risk modifiers. These polymorphisms have also been analyzed in 94 brains, 39 from patients with pathologically confirmed AD and 55 controls. The statistical investigation included the evaluation of different individual risks and a multinomial logistic regression analysis to detect predictive factors. The risk of AACD and AD increased with age, feminine gender and history of stroke and decreased with education. The allele ApoE4 increased the risk of AD but not of AACD. When the impact of ApoE4 was added to the model, the effect of education and stroke disappeared as risk modifiers.",M1
18488889,"Classifying late-onset dementia with MRI: is arteriosclerotic brain degeneration the most common cause of Alzheimer's syndrome?Our aim was to use early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of cognitive decline in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Baseline structural and flow quantification MR sequences, and clinical and neuropsychological follow-up for at least two years, were performed on 62 elderly subjects with MCI. Of these subjects, 17 progressed to dementia, and 15 of these progressed to dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Conversion to clinically diagnosed DAT was related to six distinct MR profiles, including one profile suggesting severe AD (20% of these converters) and five profiles suggesting severe cerebrovascular dysfunction. Two profiles suggested arteriosclerotic brain degeneration, one profile suggested severe venous windkessel dysfunction, and two suggested marked cerebral hypoperfusion associated with very low craniospinal compliance or marked brain atrophy. As compared with vascular MR type converters, AD MR type converters showed high executive and mobility predementia performances. Severe whole anteromesial temporal atrophy and predominantly left brain atrophy on visual MR analysis was only observed in AD MR type converters. In conclusion, these observations enhance the pathogenic complexity of the Alzheimer syndrome, and suggest that the role of arteriosclerotic brain degeneration in late life dementia is underestimated.",M1
18339408,"Impact of ambiguity and risk on decision making in mild Alzheimer's disease.Decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk are crucial types of decision making in daily living at any age. This is the first study assessing these two types of decisions in patients with mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) by means of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and a newly developed, Probability-Associated Gambling (PAG) task. While rules for gains and losses are implicit in the IGT, in the PAG task rules are explicit and winning probabilities, which change from trial to trial, can be estimated. Results of the IGT indicated that DAT patients made more disadvantageous decisions than healthy controls. Patients also shifted more frequently among decks, i.e. under ambiguity decisions were taken randomly and no advantageous strategy was established over time by DAT patients. Thus, not only actual choices but also development of advantageous strategies may be revealing about decision making in the IGT. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated less advantageous choices in the PAG task as well. They gambled more often in the low winning probabilities and less frequently in the high probabilities than healthy participants. Patients' performance on both tasks correlated with measures of executive functions. Findings of the present investigation are consistent with the early pathological cerebral changes and related (cognitive, emotional) deficits reported for DAT. As suggested by our study, decisions under ambiguity as well as decisions under risk are impaired in mild DAT. It may thus be expected that patients with mild DAT have difficulties in taking decisions in every-day life situations, both in cases of ambiguity (information on probability is missing or conflicting, and the expected utility of the different options is incalculable) and in cases of risk (outcomes can be predicted by well-defined or estimable probabilities).",M1
18264641,"The validity of clinical diagnoses of dementia in a group of consecutively autopsied memory clinic patients.BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that up to 10% of individuals aged 65 years and older suffer from dementia, most commonly from dementia of the Alzheimer Type (<e>DAT</e>) (1). Clinicopathological studies are critical to our understanding of this disease and improving the accuracy of clinical diagnoses. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine the validity of clinical diagnoses of DAT, to determine the prevalence of different forms of dementia in this sample, and to investigate the relationship between age at death and polymorbidity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Clinical data were available from 221 patients who had been examined at the Basel Memory Clinic between 1986 and 1996. From this population, 34% (75 patients) were autopsied in the Department of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, and neuropathological examinations were additionally performed on 62 (83%) of these patients. Clinical and neuropathological data were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: 67.8% of the neuropathologically examined patients received a definitive diagnosis of AD (Alzheimer's disease), vascular dementia (VaD) or mixed dementia (AD and VaD). AD alone or with other histopathological hallmarks of dementia was the most prevalent neuropathological diagnosis (63%). VaD was deemed the only cause of dementia in only 4.8% of patients. The sensitivity for DAT was 75.9%, the specificity 60.6%. Increasing age was associated with an increasing number of clinical and neuropathological diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnoses of DAT found in our study are similar to previous reports (2-5). Older patients had more etiologies of their dementia than younger patients. This study reaffirms the need for internationally accepted criteria for clinical and neuropathological diagnoses, as well as further clinical-neuropathological investigations to further refine the clinical diagnostic process.",M1
18249009,"Parallel transport in diffeomorphisms distinguishes the time-dependent pattern of hippocampal surface deformation due to healthy aging and the dementia of the Alzheimer's type.Hippocampal surface structure was assessed at twice 2 years apart in 26 nondemented subjects (CDR 0), in 18 subjects with early dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>, CDR 0.5), and in 9 subjects who converted from the nondemented (CDR 0) to the demented (CDR 0.5) state using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We used parallel transport in diffeomorphisms under the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework to translate within-subject deformation of the hippocampal surface as represented in the MR images between the two time points in a global template coordinate system. We then performed hypothesis testing on the longitudinal variation of hippocampal shape in the global template. Both subjects with early DAT and converters showed greater rates of hippocampal deformation across time than nondemented controls within every subfield of the hippocampus. In a random field analysis, inward surface deformation across time occurred in a non-uniform manner across the hippocampal surface in subjects with early DAT relative to the nondemented controls. Also, compared to the controls, the lateral aspect of the left hippocampal tail showed inward surface deformation in the converters. Using surface deformation patterns as features in a linear discriminant analysis, we were able to respectively distinguish converters and patients with early DAT from healthy nondemented controls at classification rates of 0.77 and 0.87, which were obtained in the same training set using the leave-one-out cross validation approach.",M1
18079420,"The power of personality in discriminating between healthy aging and early-stage Alzheimer's disease.This study examined differences in personality in the earliest stages of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) relative to healthy aging, and the power of personality in discriminating healthy aging from early-stage DAT. Four groups of participants (middle-aged controls, older controls, persons with very mild DAT, and persons with mild DAT) and their families were administered Costa and McCrae's NEO Five-Factor Inventory. On the basis of both self-report and informant report, there was an increase in neuroticism and a decrease in conscientiousness in persons with very mild DAT relative to healthy individuals without it, and in persons with mild DAT relative to those with very mild DAT. Moreover, informant reports of neuroticism and conscientiousness capture substantial unique variance in discriminating healthy aging and very mild DAT, above and beyond standard neuropsychological tests. Discussion focuses on the importance of personality traits as a noncognitive indicator of early-stage DAT.",M1

In three experiments, we tested patients with early DAT, healthy elderly, and young adults under low memory demands to assess perceptual filtering, conflict resolution, and set switching abilities. We found no evidence of impaired perceptual filtering nor evidence of impaired conflict resolution in early DAT. In contrast, early DAT patients did exhibit a global cost in set switching consistent with an inability to maintain the goals of the task (mental set). We discuss these findings in relation to the DAT literature on executive attention, dual-tasking, and working memory.",M1
17915184,"[Alzheimer drugs for mild cognitive impairment]Improved diagnostic procedures allow to detect more patients with early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the increasing old population especially in the setting of specialised Memory Clinics. As no disease modifying or secondary preventive pharmacological treatments are presently available for AD this article discusses whether the established pharmacological treatment strategies for Alzheimer's dementia (<e>DAT</e>) could be beneficial as well for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that can be regarded a transitional stage between normal aging and DAT in many patients. The author does not recommend to treat MCI patients with Cholinesterase Inhibitors (ChE-I) or memantine first of all due to the general problems of a low specificity of the MCI concept and the missing data concerning the treatment of MCI patients with memantine. Moreover, ChE-I therapy in MCI showed weak beneficial effects on cognition and the delay of DAT onset whereas it is costly and has a high risk of side effects. Additionally, the pooled galantamin-data suggest an increased mortality compared to placebo. Finally, cortical cholinergic deficits and the corresponding cognitive deficits are commonly not present in MCI.",M1
17719631,"MRI of the 'Alzheimer syndrome'.Interest in the identification of cognitive decline in its earliest manifestations and the heterogeneity of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) explain the growing number of neuroimaging studies of AD. Alzheimer-type lesions are associated with loss of neurons, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect predominantly left atrophic changes in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and anterior hippocampus several years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Cerebrovascular disease can mimic AD in the elderly whereas MR markers of subcortical vascular disease-leukoaraiosis, lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, ventricular enlargement, cortical and hippocampal atrophy-appear to be structural changes associated with vascular-related cognitive impairment. Furthermore, analysis of prodromal forms of late-onset dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) differentiates amnesic single-domain mild cognitive impairment, which shows MR patterns similar to those observed in early-onset DAT, from other predementia patterns without atrophy at the earliest sites of AD pathology. Mesiotemporal atrophy on MRI predicts late-onset DAT, but the current rating scales or measurements of mesiotemporal atrophy do not differentiate anteromesial temporal atrophy that is highly suggestive of AD from predominantly hippocampal atrophy, suggestive of non-AD damage and, usually, vascular disease. The other, most common MRI predictors of late-onset DAT may be considered indirect markers of arterial senescence whereas brain atrophy is diffusely milder and MR markers of small-vessel disease more frequent in late-onset, compared with early-onset, DAT. Thus, MRI suggests an overestimation of AD pathology while underestimating 'arteriosclerotic brain degeneration' in the clinical picture of 'Alzheimer syndrome'.",M1
17694411,"The impact of aging on eating, drinking, and swallowing function in people with Down's syndrome.Many people with Down's syndrome (DS) experience eating, drinking, and swallowing (EDS) difficulties, which can potentially lead to life-threatening conditions such as malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia. As the life expectancy of people with DS continues to improve, there is an increasing need to examine how the aging process may further affect these conditions. Published research studies have yet to address this issue; therefore, this article draws on the literature in three associated areas in order to consider the dysphagic problems that might develop in aging people with DS. The areas examined are EDS development in children and adolescents with DS, EDS changes associated with aging, and EDS changes associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) because this condition is prevalent in older adults with DS. This article concludes that unlike in the general population, the aging process is likely to cause dysphagic difficulties in people with DS as they get older. Therefore, it is suggested that longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific aspects of EDS function that may be affected by aging and concomitant conditions in DS.",M1
17681112,"Executive dysfunction and its association with personality and behaviour changes in the development of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome and mild to moderate learning disabilities.BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people with Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by changes in personality/behaviour and executive dysfunction that are more prominent than deterioration in episodic memory. This study examines the relationship between executive dysfunction and the clinical and preclinical features of AD in DS. To determine the specificity of this relationship, performance on executive function (EF) measures is contrasted with performance on memory measures. METHODS: One hundred and three people with DS (mean age 49 years, range 36-72) with mild to moderate learning disabilities (LD) took part. Dementia diagnosis was based on the CAMDEX informant interview conducted with each participant's main carer. Reported changes in personality/behaviour and memory were recorded. Participants completed six EF and six memory measures (two of which also had a strong executive component) and the BPVS (as a measure of general intellectual ability). First, performance was compared between those with and without established dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>), controlling for age and LD severity using ANCOVA. Next, the degree to which informant-reported changes predicted cognitive test performance was examined within the non-DAT group using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: The DAT group (N=25) showed a consistent pattern of impaired performance relative to the non-DAT group (N=78), across all measures. Within the non-DAT group, number of informant-reported personality/behaviour changes was a significant predictor of performance on two EF and two 'executive memory' tests (but not on episodic memory tests). Informant-reported memory changes, however, were associated with impaired performance on a delayed recall task only. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further evidence for a specific impairment in frontal-lobe functioning in the preclinical stages of AD in DS. Implications for the assessment, diagnosis, and management of dementia in DS are discussed.",M1
17664527,"Peripheral ethanolamine plasmalogen deficiency: a logical causative factor in Alzheimer's disease and dementia.Although dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) is the most common form of dementia, the severity of dementia is only weakly correlated with DAT pathology. In contrast, postmortem measurements of cholinergic function and membrane ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) content in the cortex and hippocampus correlate with the severity of dementia in DAT. Currently, the largest risk factor for DAT is age. Because the synthesis of PlsEtn occurs via a single nonredundant peroxisomal pathway that has been shown to decrease with age and PlsEtn is decreased in the DAT brain, we investigated potential relationships between serum PlsEtn levels, dementia severity, and DAT pathology. In total, serum PlsEtn levels were measured in five independent population collections comprising &gt;400 clinically demented and &gt;350 nondemented subjects. Circulating PlsEtn levels were observed to be significantly decreased in serum from clinically and pathologically diagnosed DAT subjects at all stages of dementia, and the severity of this decrease correlated with the severity of dementia. Furthermore, a linear regression model predicted that serum PlsEtn levels decrease years before clinical symptoms. The putative roles that PlsEtn biochemistry play in the etiology of cholinergic degeneration, amyloid accumulation, and dementia are discussed.",M1
17628603,"Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: effects of shifting and interference in simple arithmetic.The present study investigated arithmetic processing in patients with mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) without dementia. Arithmetic processing (e.g., 2+3=?, 3 x 4=?) was evaluated in (1) 'blocked' condition (without extra load on attentional and executive functions), in (2) 'mixed' condition (shifting between different operations was required), and in (3) 'Stroop-like' condition (executive control and inhibition of automatic retrieval processes were needed). Both DAT and MCI patients showed intact arithmetic knowledge retrieval from long-term memory in the blocked condition. However, DAT patients were compromised whenever load was put on executive functions, whereas MCI patients succeeded to shift between operations (mixed condition) but had difficulties to inhibit overlearned associations (Stroop-like condition). In line with previous studies, these findings point to the contribution of attentional and executive functions in arithmetic. The present investigation is also of clinical relevance: it suggests that it may be important to assess arithmetic processing not only in blocked presentation but also in mixed presentation. The mixed condition has a high ecological value because it mimics daily-life arithmetic activities (e.g., checking the grocery bill). As indicated by the present results, DAT and MCI patients who are in the normal range at routine neuropsychological (blocked) arithmetic assessments may experience difficulties by extra requirement of non-numerical resources. That means, they possibly process arithmetic not efficiently in daily-life situations.",M1
17427733,"Large deformation diffeomorphism and momentum based hippocampal shape discrimination in dementia of the Alzheimer type.In large-deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM), the diffeomorphic matching of images are modeled as evolution in time, or a flow, of an associated smooth velocity vector field v controlling the evolution. The initial momentum parameterizes the whole geodesic and encodes the shape and form of the target image. Thus, methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) of the initial momentum leads to analysis of anatomical shape and form in target images without being restricted to small-deformation assumption in the analysis of linear displacements. We apply this approach to a study of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). The left hippocampus in the DAT group shows significant shape abnormality while the right hippocampus shows similar pattern of abnormality. Further, PCA of the initial momentum leads to correct classification of 12 out of 18 DAT subjects and 22 out of 26 control subjects.",M1
17416970,"Localizations of endogenous APP/APP-proteolytic products are consistent with microtubular transport.Dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) is associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Goldstein and coworkers have suggested that APP acts as a cargo receptor connecting post-Golgi vesicles and motor proteins. Sisodia and colleagues have suggested that APP is a passive passenger within the vesicles. Both views predict that one should be able to visualize colocalizations of APP with microtubules, the object of the present investigation. To avoid possible artifacts created by APP overexpression, we studied endogenous expression in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH). Using high resolution fluorescence microscopy and antibodies specific for the amino termini of APP and A beta sequences, we found that endogenous APP and A beta peptide immunoreactivities colocalized with microtubules in interphase cells. Disruption of microtubules, followed by fixation at various time points during repolymerization, allowed us to observe the sequence and timing of these colocalizations in interphase cells. In addition, to our surprise, we found that A beta immunoreactivities colocalize with the mitotic spindle, a bundle of specialized microtubules. Because of the condensed cytoplasm found in neurons, we suggest that SK-N-SH cells might be a more convenient experimental system for exploring the mechanisms that underlie these protein localizations and the pathology that might result from altered APP protein structure and function.",M1
17365083,"Pragmatic skills in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease: an analysis by means of a referential communication task.BACKGROUND: Disordered discourse in cases of senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) has mainly been described in conversation and picture description tasks. The referential communication task provides researchers and clinicians with new insights on the nature of these disorders. AIMS: To study to what extent persons suffering from DAT can benefit from shared experience through trial repetition to achieve common reference. METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES: Thirteen persons suffering from DAT at minimal or mild stage (MMSE score range = 18-27) were compared with 13 healthy elderly adults (64-86 years) in neuropsychological assessment of executive functions and in a referential communication paradigm. To study how the two partners achieve mutual understanding by progressively elaborating a common ground, the task was repeated three times. OUTCOMES &amp; RESULTS: Persons with DAT produced a larger number of words than control participants and they benefited from the task repetition. However, they were less able to take into account previously shared information, used no definite referential expressions and were more idiosyncratic in their descriptions of the referent. This decline of communicative effectiveness was found not to relate closely to executive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative exchanges allow healthy elderly persons to ground reference in common experience. This process is severely disturbed in persons with DAT, in relation to poor memory of preceding episodes or to other cognitive impairments.",M1
17362141,"Semantic clustering indexes for the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised: initial exploration in elder control and dementia groups.This study examined the validity of semantic clustering indexes developed for the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). Participants were healthy adults and patients diagnosed with probable dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) or vascular dementia (VaD). Neuropsychological test records, which included the HVLT-R, were collected from an archival database. Ratio semantic clustering (RSC) scores were calculated for each HVLT-R recall trial. Factor analysis including RSC and other HVLT-R scores yielded high loadings of RSC scores on a distinct clustering factor. Group comparisons showed that normal controls had higher HVLT-R recall and RSC scores than DAT and VaD patients. Only the DAT group showed significant decline in RSC from the final learning trial to delayed recall, and only the DAT group performed more poorly than controls on other semantic processing measures (e.g., HVLT-R semantically-related false positives, Boston Naming Test). Results suggest that these newly developed semantic clustering indexes are easily calculated and potentially useful for discriminating between elder controls and dementia patients.",M1
17356308,"Amisulpride versus risperidone treatment for behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type: a randomized, open, prospective study.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of both amisulpride and risperidone for treating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Twenty-eight patients with DAT were randomly assigned to treatment with either amisulpride or risperidone for 8 weeks. The effectiveness of the treatments was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale. The Simpson-Angus Rating Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used for the assessment of side effects. The NPI and CGI-S scores were significantly decreased over time in both treatment groups without any significant group difference and time by treatment group interaction effect (F=71.85, p&lt;0.0001). There were no serious adverse events in both groups. This study showed that either amisulpride or risperidone would be effective and tolerable for treating patients with DAT. Adequately powered studies with a head-to-head comparison design will be mandatory to draw any definite conclusion.",M1
17334269,"Social cognition: an early impairment in dementia of the Alzheimer type.OBJECTIVE: A core component of social functioning is the capacity to attribute mental states to others and to understand intention as psychologic cause. The hypothesis of this study was that dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) patients show an impaired understanding of psychologic cause although they remain able to understand physical causality. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, 20 elderly adults with DAT, 20 healthy age-matched controls, and 20 healthy young adults were presented a cartoon task requiring them to process physical or psychologic cause of events. RESULTS: Patients with DAT at onset scored significantly lower than controls when they had to reason about psychologic causation, while they did not differ for reasoning about physical causation. Consistent with these results, patients with DAT showed significantly lower scores in psychologic reasoning as compared with their scores for physical causality. Instead young and elderly healthy adults scored similarly for the 2 types of causality and the 2 groups did not differ in their scores. These results suggest that impaired understanding of intention in others may be considered as an early socio-cognitive index of onset of DAT. A post hoc division of the group of patients with DAT into 2 subgroups according to Mini Mental State (MMS) scores showed that the group with the more severe MMS scores not only had lower scores for psychologic causality but also showed impairment in reasoning about physical causality involving persons. Physical causality involving objects remained relatively preserved. CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable deficit in attribution of intention in our patients with DAT at onset and the following deterioration of their performance in reasoning about physical causality with persons may reflect progressive dysfunction of the superior temporal sulcus in Alzheimer disease.",M1
17330392,"3DSRT evaluation of responses of Alzheimer type dementia to donepezil hydrochloride therapy.BACKGROUND: Dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) has been diagnosed objectively by using single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Donepezil hydrochloride (donepezil) is available for the symptomatic treatment of DAT. In a quantitative evaluation of therapeutic response in DAT, to compare with regional cerebral blood flows (rCBF) of various lesions before and after treatment, uptake in some sorts of cerebral regions of interests (ROIs) were used to be measured. But ROI analysis has problems such as poor reproducibility and lack of objectivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the evaluation of therapeutic response by three-dimensional stereotaxic ROI template (3DSRT), fully automated ROI analysis software, which can objectively estimate rCBF. METHODS: SPECT studies and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Japan cognitive Subscale function test ADAS-Jcog, as recognitive function test were performed for 22 patients (16 females, 6 males mean age = 73.6 years) who were diagnosed as DAT. On 3DSRT, we compared ratios of the rCBF values of the parietal lobes, temporo-occipital lobes, hippocampus, corpus callosum and the frontal lobes/cerebellar hemispheres before and after medical treatment. To determine a cut-off number of areas exhibiting improved blood flow optimal as an indicator of improvement in cognitive function in response to treatment, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of number of areas improved blood flow was performed. RESULTS: The number of cases exhibiting changes in cognitive function was greatest when the cut-off number of areas exhibiting improved blood flow was set at 5. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of evaluation of therapeutic response to Donepezil in patients with DAT using 3DSRT was thus demonstrated by our study.",M1
17328931,"Decision-making with explicit and stable rules in mild Alzheimer's disease.Decision-making in mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) was assessed in a gambling task with stable and explicit rules [Game of Dice Task; Brand, M., Labudda, K., Kalbe, E., Hilker, R., Emmans, D., Fuchs, G., et al. (2004). Decision-making impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease. Behavioural Neurology, 15, 77-85]. DAT patients in an early stage of the disease chose safe alternatives as frequently as healthy elderly persons and did not show risky behaviour as has been reported for other neurological patient groups. However, a more detailed analysis disclosed important differences between DAT and healthy elderly. Compared to healthy controls, DAT patients shifted more frequently between safe and risky alternatives and showed less consistent response patterns. Frequent changes between strategies indicate that decisions were taken randomly, that no advantageous strategy was established and that no consistent response pattern was developed over time. As regards performance changes over the task, healthy participants had a stronger tendency towards safe and advantageous responses than DAT patients. While healthy controls showed learning as the task proceeded, DAT patients did not adapt their strategies. The proportion of  consistently safe responders  was significantly higher in the control group than in the DAT group. Analysis of reaction times indicated that differences in response behaviour were not due to fast and impulsive decision taking in the DAT group. DAT patients' response pattern may be attributed to deficits in learning and in executive functions. The frequency of changes between safe and risky choices proved to be a fair predictor for the distinction between mild DAT and healthy aging.",M1
17316690,"MRI confirms mild cognitive impairments prodromal for Alzheimer's, vascular and Parkinson-Lewy body dementias.OBJECTIVES: MRI assessments were correlated with serial Combined Mini-Mental Cognitive Capacity Screening Examinations (CMC). Vascular-MCI (VMCI), Neurodegenerative MCI (NMCI) and Parkinson-Lewy body MCI (PLB-MCI) were compared during conversions to dementia. Mild cognitive impairments (MCI) are identifiable prodromes for all dementia subtypes. MRI abnormalities are characterized among MCI subjects prodromal for dementia of Alzheimer's disease (<e>DAT</e>), vascular dementia (VaD) and Parkinson-Lewy body dementia (PLBD). METHODS: Aging volunteers (n=166) were recruited from ongoing longitudinal studies of aging, stroke, cerebrovascular disease and dementia. Cognitively normal (CN, n=52), MCIs of neurodegenerative (N-MCI, n=30), vascular (V-MCI, n=35) and Parkinson-Lewy Body (PLB-MCI, n=8) subtypes, plus converted DAT (n=19), VaD (n=17) and PLBD (n=5) were all diagnosed according to established protocol recommendations. Cerebral MRI abnormalities were likewise intercorrelated utilizing quantitative volumetric measurements. RESULTS: V-MCI and converted VaD showed extensive leukoaraiosis with more lacunar infarcts than subjects with N-MCI or PLB-MCI. N-MCI, prodromal for DAT, showed medial temporal atrophy, greater enlargement of temporal horns, and fewer vascular lesions. PLB-MCI, prodromal for PLBD, displayed third ventricular enlargement greater than N-MCI and V-MCI, with similar but less severe atrophy of medial temporal lobe than N-MCI and fewer vascular lesions than V-MCI. Cognitive Impairments due to PLB with vascular features (V-PLB-CI) showed more lacunar and microvascular lesions involving both white matter and basal ganglia with greater frontal horn enlargement. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms different MCI subtypes prior to conversion to different dementias listed, recognizable by specific MRI abnormalities.",M1
17100508,"Prospective memory and apolipoprotein E in healthy aging and early stage Alzheimer's disease.The present study examined whether prospective memory performance discriminates healthy aging from very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) and individuals at risk for DAT because of the presence of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele. Four groups (young subjects, young-old control subjects, old-old control subjects, and subjects with very mild DAT) engaged in an event-based prospective memory task wherein they responded to a specific word embedded in a general knowledge test. Results indicated that prospective memory performance was clearly impaired in the very mild DAT group relative to the healthy older control groups. Moreover, prospective memory performance appears to capture unique variance in discriminating these 2 groups above and beyond standard retrospective memory tests. However, prospective memory was not affected by ApoE status in the young-old control group and, contrary to predictions, the epsilon4+ old-old control subjects showed better performance than did the epsilon4- subjects. In contrast to the healthy individuals, in the very mild DAT group, epsilon4+ subjects showed deficits in performance relative to the epsilon4- subjects. Discussion focuses on prospective memory as a cognitive indicator of early stage DAT.",M1
17069865,"Semantic relevance, domain specificity and the sensory/functional theory of category-specificity.According to the sensory/functional theory of semantic memory, Living items rely more on Sensory knowledge than Non-living ones. The sensory/functional explanation of category-specificity assumes that semantic features are organised on the basis of their content. We report here a study on <e>DAT</e> patients with impaired performance on Living items and tests of Sensory knowledge, and show that this impairment not only disappears after parcelling out semantic relevance, but is also reversed if this parameter is appropriately manipulated. Although semantic relevance model predicts these results [Sartori, G., &amp; Lombardi, L. (2004). Semantic relevance and semantic disorders. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 16, 439-452], they run counter to both the sensory/functional theory and the domain-specific theory of category-specific impairment.",M1
17034821,"Evidence for a dissociation of structural and semantic knowledge in dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>).Object recognition and naming deficits in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) have typically been attributed to deficits in semantic processing, with only a few studies proposing loci of deficits other than semantic. One possible cause of DAT object recognition impairments could involve deficits in processing structural aspects of visually presented items. In this paper, we assess the performance of a group of mild DAT patients on two tasks of structural access, object decision, and the complete/incomplete task (based on part-whole matching task), as well as on a semantic probes task, designed to assess the patients' semantic knowledge of the same items for which structural knowledge had earlier been assessed. The DAT patients were substantially impaired in their performance on tasks of structural access. Further, no evidence for item-to-item consistency in the DAT patients' errors for the structural and semantic tasks was found, raising the possibility that structural and semantic knowledge may become differentially impaired in DAT.",M1
17011743,"Using verbal fluency to detect very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type.The study sample included 76 healthy older adults and 77 individuals with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Semantic (animal) and letter (S and P) fluency tasks were used to examine quantitative (word generation) and qualitative (category clustering and switching) aspects of verbal fluency. The goal of the study was to evaluate the utility of fluency tasks in discriminating between healthy aging and very mild DAT. Our results indicated better performance for the healthy group than the DAT group in terms of number of words, number of clusters, number of switches, and size of clusters generated (an exception was clustering on letter S fluency). Clustering and switching variables were significantly correlated with number of words generated and therefore were not included in discriminant analysis. Discriminant analysis revealed that the combination of semantic fluency and narrative recall may be particularly useful in differentiating healthy aging from very mild DAT.",M1
16977674,"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and Alzheimer's dementia in older subjects.OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We investigated the association of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels with dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and impairment in selected cognitive domains (memory, language, attention and working memory) in 158 patients (75.5+/-6.7 years, 46 men) with first-diagnosed probable DAT and in 158 age- and sex-matched controls. As secondary goal, we evaluated whether DHEA-S baseline levels were associated with cumulative 6-year mortality. RESULTS: A negative correlation between DHEA-S levels and age was observed (R=-0.25, p&lt;0.001). Age-stratified analysis did not show significant differences of DHEA-S levels between DAT patients and controls. No significant association was found between DHEA-S levels and impairment in selected cognitive domains. Cox regression analysis showed that baseline DHEA-S levels were not associated with cumulative 6-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of newly-diagnosed DAT patients, we did not find significant association between presence of DAT or impairment in cognitive domains and DHEA-S levels; baseline DHEA-S levels are not associated with cumulative mortality in patients and controls.",M1
16966511,"Accelerated weight loss may precede diagnosis in Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of weight loss and the onset of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) and to characterize the rate of weight change over time in older adults (aged 65-95 years) who develop DAT vs those who remain without dementia. DESIGN: Rates of weight change were investigated in older adult research participants (N = 449) who were enrolled as control subjects without dementia and followed up longitudinally (6 years on average) at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine. Some individuals (n = 125) eventually developed DAT; the others (n = 324) remained without dementia. Body weight was measured at each annual assessment. Piecewise linear regression and random effects models were used to test longitudinal rates of weight change between the groups. RESULTS: Participants without dementia lost about 0.6 lb per year. For those individuals who developed DAT, about 1 year before the detection of DAT, the rate of weight loss doubled (1.2 lb per year). As a group, participants who eventually developed DAT weighed less (about 8 pounds) at study enrollment (ie, when they did not have dementia) than participants who remained without dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Aging with and without DAT is associated with weight loss; however, weight loss may accelerate before the diagnosis of DAT. Specific factors contributing to weight loss are unknown, but these data suggest they operate before the development of DAT. Hence, weight loss may be a preclinical indicator of Alzheimer disease.",M1
16955450,"Early diagnosis of dementia in primary care: a representative eight-year follow-up study in Lower Saxony, Germany.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether primary care competency in early diagnosis of dementia might have changed during 1993 and 2001. METHOD: By means of a representative follow-up survey 122 out of 170 (71.8%) family physicians (FPs) in Lower Saxony, Germany, were randomly assigned to two written case samples presenting a patient with mild cognitive impairment (case 1a vs. 1b: female vs. male patient) and moderate dementia (case 2a vs 2b: vascular type (VD) vs Alzheimer's disease (<e>DAT</e>)), respectively. By means of a structured face-to-face interview, they were asked for their diagnostic considerations. RESULTS: In comparison to 1993, dementia was significantly more frequently considered. However, there was a striking tendency in overestimating vascular aetiology and under-diagnosing probable DAT (case 1a/1b: DAT: 11.0% in 1993 vs 26.2% in 2001; VD: 2.1% in 1993 vs 17.2% in 2001). As a possible contributor to a dementia syndrome, concomitant medication was considered only exceptionally (case 2a/2b: 4.4% in 1993 vs 2.5% in 2001). Physicians above 50 years of age showed a significantly lower early diagnostic awareness. At follow-up, the presumed interest in geriatric (psychiatric) topics dramatically faded from 66.9% to 35.2%.

A total of 28 healthy older adults and 28 older adults with Alzheimer's type dementia (<e>DAT</e>) were asked to perform or to imagine performing simple action statements in a running memory test. This task required participants to tell whether the action statement had been carried out or imagined, or whether it was new at unpredictable intervals. The results indicated that older adults with DAT had greater difficulty in reality monitoring than did the healthy control group. The finding is discussed in terms of the role of working memory functions in reality monitoring.",M1
16894106,"[11C]PIB in a nondemented population: potential antecedent marker of Alzheimer disease.BACKGROUND: Beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are the hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). A PET imaging tracer that binds to Abeta plaques in vivo, N-methyl-[(11)C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (or [(11)C]PIB for  Pittsburgh Compound-B ), has significantly higher binding in subjects diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) compared to nondemented controls. The authors used this imaging technique to investigate whether abnormal binding occurs in clinically normal individuals, prior to the development of cognitive changes. METHODS: Forty-one nondemented subjects (age range 20 to 86 years) and 10 patients with DAT (age range 66 to 86 years) underwent [(11)C]PIB PET scanning. Regions of interest were drawn on the MRI over the cerebellar, prefrontal, lateral temporal, occipital, gyrus rectus, precuneus, and striatal cortex. Binding potential values (BPs), proportional to the density of [(11)C]PIB-Abeta binding sites, were calculated using the Logan graphical analysis and the cerebellar cortex for a reference tissue. RESULTS: Patients with DAT had elevated BP values vs nondemented subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Four of the 41 nondemented subjects had elevated cortical BP values and their BP values as a group were not significantly different from the DAT subjects' BP values. Two of these four nondemented subjects had [(11)C]PIB uptake, both visually and quantitatively, that was indistinguishable from the DAT subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated [(11)C]PIB binding in nondemented subjects suggests that [(11)C]PIB amyloid imaging may be sensitive for detection of a preclinical Alzheimer disease state. Longitudinal studies will be required to determine the association of elevated [(11)C]PIB binding and risk of developing dementia of the Alzheimer type.",M1
16887774,"Divergent thinking in Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.Twenty-three patients with mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) or frontotemporal type (DFT) and age- and education-matched control subjects were administered tests of complex fluency involving divergent thinking and tests of letter, category, and figural fluency. The tests of complex fluency discriminated the dementia patients from control subjects more strongly than did the other fluency tests. The results suggest that divergent thinking as assessed by complex fluency tests is a cognitive domain that is impaired early in the course of dementia. The sensitivity of complex fluency tests compared to that of letter, category, and figural fluency tests may be related to greater demands for conceptualization in relating stimulus attributes to function and greater demands for flexible thinking during self-directed search processes.",M1
16866013,"Clinical evidence and evidence-based dental treatment of special populations: patients with Alzheimer's disease.This paper presents the novel domain of evidence-based research in the context of treating the dental needs of patients with special needs. A contrast is made between evidence-based dentistry and traditional dentistry, which is based on the evidence obtained by the dentist, with respect to the needs and the wants of the patient, and from the pertinent and accessible literature. By contrast, evidence-based dentistry is focused on integrating traditional dentistry with  the best available  research evidence. The aim of evidence-based dentistry is to improve clinical decision-making by its reliance on a critical analysis of the entire body of the published pertinent literature. It is a system of information management, and a system of data integration that assist clinicians in the process of meshing systemic clinical expertise, evidence provided by the patient, and the best literature evidence to enhance treatment outcomes. Evidence-based dentistry emphasizes rigorous analysis of evidence from clinical research, as the basis of sound dental practice, while discouraging intuitive and unsystematic approaches and promoting the systematic analysis and appraisal of the literature to determine the best treatment alternatives. In the case of patients with special needs, it is critical whether the dentist practices traditional dentistry or evidence-based dentistry to evaluate whether or not the patient is capable of expressing his or her needs/wants, unless, as in the more severe cases, he/she is accompanied by the caregiver. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of a simple in-house questionnaire for evaluating the patient's ability to tell the dentist his or her needs and wants accurately. In this context, the paper examines the dental needs of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, <e>DAT</e>.",M1
16822739,"Age of acquisition affects object recognition and naming in patients with Alzheimer's disease.Twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) and a comparison group of 22 age-matched individuals took part in an object decision and picture naming task. The age of acquisition (AoA) of the picture names was manipulated (25 early, 25 late). The comparison group identified significantly more objects as real than the patients. While the comparison group made very few errors in object decision, DAT patients failed to classify significantly more late than early acquired objects as real. The patients also named significantly fewer pictures than the comparison group, showing a differential impairment in naming late acquired objects. Late acquired objects induced proportionately more visual errors in the patients than did early acquired objects. The results are discussed in terms of current theories of age of acquisition and of the impact of Alzheimer's disease on lexical and semantic processing.",M1
16772356,"Higher cortical deficits influence attentional processing in dementia with Lewy bodies, relative to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type and controls.BACKGROUND: Attentional dysfunction is believed to be a prominent and distinguishing neuropsychological feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB); yet, the specific nature of the attentional deficit and factors that can potentially influence attentional processing in DLB have not been fully defined. AIMS: To clarify the nature of the attentional deficit in early-stage DLB relative to patients with early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and elderly controls, and examine the effect of task complexity and type of cognitive load on attentional processing in DLB. METHODS: Attentional impairment and fluctuating attention were investigated in three groups of subjects--patients with clinical features of early probable DLB (n = 20), a group with early probable DAT (n = 19) and healthy elderly controls (n = 20)--using an experimental computerised reaction time paradigm. RESULTS: Patients with DLB showed greater attentional impairment and fluctuations in attention relative to patients with DAT and elderly controls. The attentional deficit was generalised in nature but increased in magnitude as greater demands were placed on attentional selectivity. Attentional deficits in DLB were most pronounced under task conditions that required more active recruitment of executive control and visuospatial cognitive processes. CONCLUSIONS: Attentional deficits in DLB are widespread and encompass all aspects of attentional function. Deficits in higher cortical function influence the degree of attentional impairment and fluctuating attention, suggesting that attentional processing in DLB is mediated by interacting cortical and subcortical mechanisms. These findings serve to clarify the nature of the attentional deficit in DLB and have potentially important ramifications for our understanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of fluctuations.",M1
16723320,"Counting complex dot patterns in Alzheimer's disease.Patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (<e>DAT</e>) showed considerable difficulties assessing the numerosity of complex dot patterns (up to 30 dots). Patients' and controls' performance was found to be modulated by the spatial array of dot patters. Dots presented in curved lines were easier to count than dots in circle arrays or in random arrays. Highly significant between group differences were found in counting dots in circle arrays, but not in counting curved lines. Patients and controls differed in the choice of counting strategies. While controls efficiently adapted their counting strategies to the respective dot patterns, DAT patients were not able to adapt counting strategies to the requirements of the spatial arrays. Analysis of error types further evidenced the particular difficulties of patients. Several recounts in counting circle arrays reflected difficulties to stop counting, while omissions in random patterns suggested deficits in monitoring already counted items. Results of this study suggest that deficits in executive functions prevented patients from selecting and adapting counting strategies in order to keep track of already counted items, to enhance accuracy and to reduce demands on cognitive resources.",M1
16624786,"Application of new WAIS-III/WMS-III discrepancy scores for evaluating memory functioning: relationship between intellectual and memory ability.Analysis of the discrepancy between memory and intellectual ability has received some support as a means for evaluating memory impairment. Recently, comprehensive base rate tables for General Ability Index (GAI) minus memory discrepancy scores (i.e., GAI-memory) were developed using the WAIS-III/WMS-III standardization sample (Lange, Chelune, &amp; Tulsky, in press). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of GAI-memory discrepancy scores to identify memory impairment in 34 patients with Alzheimer's type dementia (<e>DAT</e>) versus a sample of 34 demographically matched healthy participants. On average, patients with DAT obtained significantly lower scores on all WAIS-III and WMS-III indexes and had larger GAI-memory discrepancy scores. Clinical outcome analyses revealed that GAI-memory scores were useful at identifying memory impairment in patients with DAT versus matched healthy participants. However, GAI-memory discrepancy scores failed to provide unique interpretive information beyond that which is gained from the memory indexes alone. Implications and future research directions are discussed.",M1
16567037,"Apathy in patients with mild cognitive impairment and the risk of developing dementia of Alzheimer's disease: a one-year follow-up study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between apathy and development of dementia in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-one French-speaking outpatients fulfilling the criteria of amnestic MCI were enrolled. Apathy was assessed with the Apathy Inventory (IA). Neuropsychiatric evaluation also included the Goldberg anxiety scale and the Montgomery and Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). The main end point considered after a 1-year follow-up was the development of dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). RESULTS: At baseline there were 86 (39.8%) subjects presenting at least one symptom of apathy among the 216 included in analysis. After a 1-year follow-up, 22 patients developed DAT. Of the patients with apathy at baseline 13 (15.1%) developed DAT in comparison with 9 (6.9%) of the non-apathetic patients. At the 1-year follow-up, patients developing DAT had a significantly higher frequency of apathetic symptoms (91.7%) than patients without DAT (26.9%). CONCLUSION: Taking into account that apathy is one of the most frequently observed neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI and in DAT the present study suggests that patients with MCI and apathy should be more closely observed.",M1
16538589,"[A description of semantic memory performance in a sample of the Antioquian population]INTRODUCTION: Available treatments for Alzheimer disease allow that early diagnosis become an important issue, because treatment only are useful during the earliest stage, especially during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), when the most of the cognitive function is preserved. AIM: To observe the performance on a shortened version of a Semantic Cue Recall Memory Test (SCRMT) from a group of adult aged over 50 years old, living in Medellin city and with dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample was constituted by 30 patients with DAT, 30 with MCI, and 59 healthy controls, which were matched by socio economic strata and school achievement. The SCRMT was administered to the sample. For the analyses two groups of age (50-69 and over 70 years) were conformed. RESULTS: Comparisons statistically significant differences between the groups (p &lt; 0.05). The scores were not significant affected by age. A combination of low scores with the presence of intrusions on the free, immediate cue, and delay cue recalls suggested the diagnosis of DAT, which allow recommending a complete neuropsychological assessment. Statistically significant differences were preserved when the groups were divided by age. The effect of the gender could not determine because the small size of the male sample. CONCLUSION: The shortened version of the SCMRT would appear be useful for the DAT diagnosis.",M1
16493989,"[Degree of discomfort following the decision to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration in institutionalised psychogeriatric patients with severe dementia who no longer or scarcely eat or drink]OBJECTIVE: To determine the level and course of discomfort after the decision was made to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) in nursing home patients with severe dementia who scarcely or no longer eat and drink. DESIGN: Longitudinal questionnaire investigation. METHOD: In a prospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted in 32 Dutch nursing homes, discomfort was measured in 178 patients using the observational 'Discomfort scale for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type' (DS-<e>DAT</e>) at various time points: on the day of the decision to discontinue ANH and 2, 5, 9, 14 and 42 days thereafter. Data on factors that may have influenced the degree of discomfort were also collected at all time points. RESULTS: The decision to forgo ANH occurred most often in severely demented female patients with an acute illness. Overall, 134 patients (75%) died within 1-2 weeks after the decision. The mean level ofdiscomfort was highest on the day of the decision and decreased thereafter. However, the degree of discomfort differed substantially among patients. The presence of dyspnoea, restlessness, and physician-observed pain and dehydration were associated with higher levels of discomfort. Patients who were awake had higher levels of observed discomfort than patients who were asleep. CONCLUSION: Discontinuing ANH in patients with severe dementia who scarcely or no longer eat or drink was not generally associated with high levels of discomfort and therefore appears to be an acceptable decision. The individual differences emphasise the need for constant attention to distressful symptoms.",M1
16477584,"Association of depression with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in an elderly Arab population of Wadi-Ara, Israel.OBJECTIVES: Because dementia and depression share common risk factors, we investigated risk factors for depression in Arab subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based study, we conducted a door-to-door survey of all adults over age 60 in an Arab community of rural Israel. We conducted interviews, gave questionnaires, and collected DNA blood specimens for determination of ApoE genotype. RESULTS: Of the 823 individuals in this naturalistic sample, 168 had dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and 49 had VaD. Vascular risk factors, including the ApoE-epsilon4 allele, were more prevalent among VaD than DAT subjects. Depressive symptoms were present in 57% of DAT patients and 86% of VaD patients. Depressed DAT individuals had a greater history of ischemic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular (CV/CBV) disease than non-depressed DAT subjects, but depressed DAT subjects were less likely to have the ApoE-epsilon4 allele. Within the VaD group, there was no difference in the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with and without depressive symptoms, and ApoE-epsilon4 was more prevalent among subjects with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology is prevalent among subjects with dementias in this Arab community. History of CV/CBV is associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in DAT. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of ApoE in depression onset in different ethnic groups with DAT.",M1
16476930,"The cognitive profile of posterior cortical atrophy.BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a progressive dementia characterized by prominent disorders of higher visual processing, affecting both dorsal and ventral streams to cause Balint's syndrome, alexia, and visual agnosia. OBJECTIVE: To define the cognitive profile of PCA and compare to the typical, primary amnestic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). METHODS: The authors used standard cognitive tests and a novel battery designed to reflect dysfunction in both ventral (Object, Face &amp; Color Agnosia Screen [OFCAS]) and dorsal (complex pictures and compound stimuli) visual streams. The authors identified 19 patients with PCA and compared their performance to a matched group of patients with DAT and normal controls. RESULTS: Patients with PCA were younger with marked impairment in visuospatial tasks, reading, and writing but relative preservation of memory compared to DAT using standard tests. Dorsal stream signs were most prevalent among the patients with PCA with no pure ventral stream syndromes found. All novel tests distinguished reliably between subjects with complex picture descriptions and processing of compound stimuli showing the most significant differences compared to DAT. CONCLUSIONS: PCA is predominantly a dorsal stream syndrome, distinct from typical DAT, which involves occipitotemporal regions over time.",M1
16472359,"Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia of Alzheimer type.Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes the condition of memory-impaired individuals who otherwise function well and do not meet the clinical criteria for dementia. Such individuals are considered to represent a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia of Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). Neurobiologic changes in amnestic MCI, and their significance for psychophysiologic function, are poorly understood. In this study, the authors compared acoustic prepulse inhibition (PPI) between subjects with amnestic MCI and mild DAT to characterize sensorimotor gating. The acoustic startle reflex, which the authors measured using an accelerometer and electromyogram, involves whole-body movement and eye blink in response to a sudden loud noise (115 dB). PPI is inhibition of this reflex by a softer noise (prepulse; 85 dB) preceding the startle stimulus by 30 ms. PPI was examined in 30 controls, 20 subjects with amnestic MCI, and 20 subjects with mild DAT. Neither amnestic MCI nor mild DAT affected startle movement amplitude. Subjects with amnestic MCI showed significantly enhanced PPI (gating facilitation), while subjects with mild DAT exhibited significantly less PPI than controls (gating deficit). This pattern of PPI changes suggests that neuropathologic changes in the limbic cortex, mainly the entorhinal cortex, at the earliest stage of DAT might be responsible for PPI abnormalities via disturbed regulation of the limbic cortico-striato-pallido-pontine circuitry. Startle PPI changes could be used as a biologic marker for amnestic MCI and mild DAT.",M1
16403248,"Validation of a new symptom impact questionnaire for mild to moderate cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes assessment enhances the understanding of disease impact in a range of disorders. At mild levels of cognitive impairment the patient perspective on functioning, behavior and symptoms can be particularly valuable for syndrome characterization when clinical and neuropsychological findings are limited. We have evaluated the psychometric performance of the 55-item Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cognitive Impairment (PROCOG), a new patient-reported measure, to measure mild to moderate cognitive impairment symptoms and their impact from the perspective of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The sample of 75 DAT patients, 78 MCI patients and 33 cognitively intact control subjects (&gt; 64 years) was recruited through medical centers in the U.SA. Validity was assessed through correlation to the Quality of Life--Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) and Centers for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale (CES-D) and neuropsychological assessments (WAIS subscales and MMSE). RESULTS: PROCOG scores for MCI patients were generally intermediate between DAT and control subjects. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable. Correlations with the CES-D and QOL-AD were in the moderate to high range; correlations with the neuropsychological measures were low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The PROCOG demonstrated good to excellent psychometric properties among a sample of older adults with MCI and DAT as well as cognitively intact older adult control subjects and provides a method for collecting unique information on the patient experience of cognitive impairment. Subscales permit focused evaluation of domains relevant to the patient's experience of cognitive impairment.",M1

The present longitudinal study compares and contrasts MRI abnormalities among MCI subjects as they progress to DAT versus VaD. Subjects converting to DAT and VaD confirmed ultimate diagnosis during MCI staging. In  mixed cases  the predominant MRI pathology was judged the primary cause. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (n = 153) were selected from elderly outpatient volunteers who have been enrolled for 25 years in planned longitudinal studies of aging, stroke and dementia. Cognitively normal (CN, n = 52), MCI of neurodegenerative (N-MCI, n = 30) and vascular (V-MCI), n = 35) subtypes, plus converted DAT (n = 19) and VaD (n = 17) were diagnosed according to established protocols. Combined Mini-Mental-Cognitive Capacity Screening Examinations (CMC) screened, identified and confirmed MCIs or dementias. Cerebral MRI abnormalities were analyzed utilizing volumetric measurements and visual rating scales. RESULTS: Compared with persistently cognitively normal subjects, MCI subjects and converted dementias were significantly older without significant gender differences, but cognitively impaired subjects were older than the CN group since age is a risk factor for cognitive decline. Histories of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, TIAs and strokes were more frequent among subjects with VMCI and VaD, confirming that all vascular risk factors contribute to vascular cognitive decline, but since vascular risk factors were treated, not all progressed to VAD. Family history of neurodegenerative disease, particularly DAT, were more prevalent among NMCI and converted DAT subjects. VMCI showed more extensive leucoaraiosis and lacunar infarcts than subjects with NMCI. NMCI, prodromal for dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), showed more medial temporal lobe atrophy with enlarged temporal horns, and fewer vascular lesions.",M1
16375660,"Progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's or vascular dementia versus normative aging among elderly Chinese.To compare differences in evolutionary progressions from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>) or to vascular dementia (VaD) versus normal aging, subjects identified as MCI or as cognitively normal (CN) during standard cognitive evaluations among a large epidemiological study designed to determine prevalence and incidence of dementia and its major subtypes in Beijing, China were re-examined after an interval of approximately 3 years, repeating the same investigation protocol as at baseline. MCI subjects meeting criteria for dementia and the two major subtypes, DAT and VaD were identified at follow-up evaluation. Annual conversion rates for combined dementias and for major subtypes of DAT and VaD, from MCI, were compared with conversion rates among CN subjects. Relative risks for conversion from MCI to major subtypes of dementia were also compared with CN subjects by Cox regression models. 175 MCI and 400 CN subjects were identified at baseline. Among 121 MCI subjects available at follow-up, 51 were diagnosed with dementia (29 with DAT, 18 with VaD and 4 with other dementias), compared with 14(10 DAT, 3 VaD and 1 other type dementia) diagnosed as dementia among 281 CN subjects available at follow-up. Annual conversion rates calculated from MCI to all dementias, compared with conversion rates from CNs, were 14.1% versus 1.6%. Specifically for DAT, annual conversion rates were 8.0% versus 1.1% and for VaD were 5.0% versus 0.3%. Relative risks for developing all dementias, DAT and VaD among MCI subjects were 9, 6 and 5 times greater than among CN subjects. Conversion rates among MCI subjects to dementia, and major subtypes, for elderly Chinese residents of Beijing were comparable with results reported among similar studies worldwide. Risks of developing dementia, and major subtypes, among MCI subjects in Beijing were significantly higher than among normal subjects. Identification of MCI among elderly populations provides the possibilities for dementia prevention and treatment within prodromal stages.",M1
16325150,"Toward a reliable distinction between patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-type dementia versus major depression.BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and its alpha-secreted form (alpha-sAPP) were investigated as a means to distinguish between individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer-type dementia (<e>DAT</e>) and those with major depressive episode (MDE) showing secondary memory deficits. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with MCI, 32 with probable DAT, and 24 with MDE attending a memory clinic were studied. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of sAPP/amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) and alpha-sAPP were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Patients with MDE had the highest CSF levels of total sAPP/APLP2 as compared with MCI and DAT patients (p &lt; .001); sAPP/APLP2 levels were higher in MCI than in DAT subjects. Whereas alpha-sAPP levels did not differ between the MCI and DAT groups, median levels of this peptide were significantly lower in MCI and DAT versus MDE patients. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble amyloid precursor protein/APLP2 and alpha-sAPP concentrations in CSF can differentiate between DAT and MCI versus MDE, facilitating early ameliorative interventions and appropriate treatment regimens.",M1
16305479,"On the physiological relevance of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in Alzheimer's disease.The loss of cholinergic neurons, particularly in the forebrain, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (<e>DAT</e>). This concept has lead to the effective treatment of DAT by means of acetylcholine (Ach) esterase inhibitors. G-protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) are classified in 5 subtypes, the M1 receptor stimulation and M2 inhibition being especially associated with cognitive skills. Modified cerebral muscarinic receptor profiles in patients with Alzheimer's disease in addition to loss of Ach releasing neurons help us to understand the pathophysiology of dementia and offer potential therapeutic approaches. Specific agonists and antagonists of muscarinic receptors are discussed as possible treatment options in DAT. Experimental results postulate a positive long lasting modulation of the pathological neuronal protein pattern in addition to their cholinomimetic effect.",M1
16286546,"Neuroanatomical predictors of response to donepezil therapy in patients with dementia.BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) respond variably to treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether measures of hippocampal volume and shape predict the response to donepezil in patients with DAT. DESIGN: T1-weighted, magnetic resonance images were obtained from patients with DAT, who subsequently underwent treatment with donepezil. Brain-mapping algorithms were used to quantify hippocampal volume and shape, and growth curves were used to estimate clinical outcome. SETTING: A referral outpatient center specializing in treatment of dementia. PATIENTS: Thirty-seven patients with very mild or mild DAT received donepezil therapy for up to 4 weeks before magnetic resonance imaging and for 24 to 96 weeks after magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTION: Donepezil, 10 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of change in the cognitive portion of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale total scores. RESULTS: Smaller hippocampal volume and inward variation of the lateral and inferomedial portions of the hippocampal surface were correlated with a poorer response to donepezil therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of hippocampal volume and surface variation can be used to predict the response of patients with DAT to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil.",M1
16243546,"Abnormalities of hippocampal surface structure in very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type.To better define the pattern of hippocampal deformity early in the course of Alzheimer's disease, we compared the pattern of hippocampal surface variation in subjects with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) and nondemented subjects. The surface of the hippocampus was divided a priori on a neuroanatomical template into three zones approximating the locations of underlying subfields [Csernansky, J.G., Wang, L., Swank, J., Miller, J.P., Gado, M., McKeel, D., Miller, M.I., Morris, J.C., 2005. Preclinical detection of Alzheimer's disease: hippocampal shape and volume predict dementia onset in the elderly. NeuroImage 25, 783--792]; i.e., a lateral zone (LZ) approximating the CA1 subfield, a superior zone (SZ) approximating the combined CA2, CA3, CA4 subfields and the gyrus dentatus (GD), and an inferior-medial zone (IMZ) approximating the subiculum. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD) was used to generate the hippocampal surfaces of all subjects and to register the surface zones across subjects. Average variations within each zone were calculated for the subjects with very mild DAT as compared to the average of the nondemented subjects. After correcting for multiple comparisons, the very mild DAT subjects showed significant inward variation in the left and right LZ, the left and right IMZ, but not in the left and right SZ as compared to nondemented subjects. In logistic regression analyses, inward variation of the left and right LZ or IMZ by 0.1 mm relative to the average of the nondemented subjects increased the odds of the subject being a very mild DAT subject (range-1.18 to 1.57) rather than being a nondemented subject. The odds ratios for the left and right SZ were not significant. These results represent a replication of our previous findings [Csernansky, J.G., Wang, L., Joshi, S., Miller, J.P., Gado, M., Kido, D., McKeel, D., Morris, J.C., Miller, M.I., 2000. Early DAT is distinguished from aging by high-dimensional mapping of the hippocampus.

16204712,"Prediction of individual clinical outcome in MCI by means of genetic assessment and (18)F-FDG PET.Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represent a risk population for progressing to dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). However, clinical criteria do not ensure reliable individual prognosis in these patients. The objective of this longitudinal, prospective study was to examine the value of (18)F-FDG PET of cerebral glucose metabolism and of genetic susceptibility, as defined by an APOEepsilon4-positive genotype, with regard to the early diagnosis of DAT in patients with MCI. METHODS: In 30 patients with the diagnosis of MCI (16 female, 14 male; age, 70 +/- 8 y), baseline and follow-up examinations (mean observation period, 16 mo) were performed. In all patients, the APOE genotype was assessed and cerebral glucose metabolism was evaluated at baseline using cranial (18)F-FDG PET. Individual PET data were screened for findings suggestive of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the help of an automated computer program. After stereotactical normalization of the PET images, this program performs an observer-independent statistical comparison with an age-matched reference database (n = 22). RESULTS: In 43% of all MCI subjects, a PET scan suggestive of AD pathology according to our predefined criteria was observed at baseline (PET+); 57% of all MCI patients were carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele (e4+). In 40% of all patients, progression of symptoms within the observation period justified the clinical diagnosis of probable DAT at the time of follow-up reevaluation. Statistical evaluation revealed the best results for PET with regard to early diagnosis of DAT in MCI patients (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 89%). Classification according to the APOE genotype was significantly less successful (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 56%). However, a combination of both diagnostic tests allowed early diagnosis with either very high specificity (PET+ AND e4+: sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 100%) or very high sensitivity (PET+ OR e4+: sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 44%). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET of cerebral glucose metabolism is a valuable diagnostic tool for the prediction of clinical outcome in individual MCI patients. Results are superior to the exclusive assessment of the APOE genotype. A combination of both functional imaging and genotyping may allow an early high-risk or low-risk stratification of patients with either very high sensitivity or very high specificity. This may be valuable, for example, for patient selection in scientific studies.",M1
16158009,"Validating the DemTect with 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography as a sensitive neuropsychological screening test for early alzheimer disease in patients of a memory clinic.OBJECTIVES: The first study to validate the diagnostic value of the DemTect, a short neuropsychological screening test for dementia (8-10 min), using 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients of a memory clinic. METHODS: DemTect results were compared to the clinical diagnosis and to FDG-PET as a reference method for the early in vivo detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: 38 patients (age 65.2 +/- 9.8 years, 16 men, 22 women) were investigated using clinical standard examination, FDG-PET, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. According to NINCDS-ADRDA and Petersen's criteria, 18 patients had dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>) and 13 patients received the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to the clinical diagnosis, a DemTect cutoff score of &lt; or =11 points demonstrated good sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (70.0%) for the detection of DAT, whereas the best cutoff score for MCI was &lt; or =13 points with comparable sensitivity (84.6%) and specificity (85.7%). With regard to FDG-PET, the DemTect demonstrated excellent sensitivity (93%) and low specificity (50%) for the detection of AD-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism (cutoff &lt; or =13 points). CONCLUSION: DemTect is a favorable neuropsychological screening instrument for detecting cognitive dysfunction even in predementia stages of AD. For definite cross-sectional diagnosis, further diagnostic evaluation with higher specificity, e.g. comprehensive neuropsychological examination, FDG-PET or other biomarkers, is necessary.",M1
16138284,"[<e>DaT</e>-SCAN SPECT in the differential diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease]INTRODUCTION: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the main differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In DLB there is 40-70% loss of striatal dopamine and the loss of dopaminergic cell is accompanied by loss of the dopamine transporter. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in DLB can be confirmed in vivo with I-FP-CIT (DaT-SCAN), a pre-synaptic dopamine transporter marker. There are no changes in DaT-scan in AD compared with controls. AIM. The use of DaT-SCAN for the differential diagnosis between AD and DLB. CASE REPORTS: We use the DaT-SCAN to study the nigrostriatal pathway in 6 patients with dementia and moderate parkinsonism. The Mini-Mental Test and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor part only (UPDRS), were performed. A SPECT scan was carried out 3 to 4 hours after administration of 185 MBq FP-CIT (ioflupane) a dopaminergic presynaptic ligand. With occipital cortex used as a radioactivity uptake reference, ratios for the caudate nucleus and the anterior and posterior putamen of both hemispheres were calculated. All scans were also rated by a simple visual method. All patients had dementia with moderate fluctuations in cognitive function, parkinsonian syndrome and hallucinations. DaT-SCAN was normal in 2 patients and pathological in 4. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the DLB criteria vary markedly. FP-CIT SPECT may be a new tool in the differential diagnosis between DLB and AD.",M1
16118528,"Performance of three clock scoring systems across different ranges of dementia severity.The ability of three different Clock Drawing Test (CDT) scoring systems to detect Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (<e>DAT</e>) was investigated. As part of a neuropsychological battery, fifty DAT Type patients and fifty matched controls drew a clock. Each drawing was scored by three independent raters according to three different scoring systems: the 3-Factor system, the Template system, and the Abbreviated system. The CDT scoring systems were able to detect Dementia of the Alzheimer Type when the disease was moderate to severe, but lacked sensitivity in milder dementia. Animal Fluency was a better single predictor of dementia. Clinicians are advised to interpret the results of the Clock Drawing Test cautiously in an outpatient setting, where milder forms of dementia and low base rates are likely.",M1
16093901,"Usefulness of p300 in subjective memory complaints: a prospective study.The existing studies about the utility of P300 latency for diagnostically classifying patients in preclinical stages of dementia are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal in design, and their results are inconclusive. The authors investigated the P300 value in a series of patients with subjective memory complaints using a prospective design. The study was performed in a consecutive series of 116 outpatients with subjective memory complaints as the predominant symptom. P300 (auditory oddball task) was performed immediately after the first clinical evaluation, and at 12 and 24 months. Final cognitive syndrome diagnosis (mean follow-up period, 27.7 months) was then made by a neurologist who was blinded to the neurophysiologic results. Diagnosis at the end of follow-up was 30 cases of normal cognition, 30 cases of mild cognitive impairment, 28 cases of dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>), five cases of vascular dementia, and one case of frontotemporal dementia; 22 patients were lost to follow-up. P300 latency was significantly higher for the DAT group (analysis of variance: P=0.023) throughout the study. The diagnostic value of P300 latency at baseline examination for DAT had a sensitivity of 52.9% and a specificity of 76.9%; the odds ratio was 3.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-11.41). Findings from the present study suggest that assessment of evoked related potentials may contribute to the early detection of DAT.",M1
16042029,"Coverbal gestures in Alzheimer's type dementia.Patterns of conversational gestures were analysed in subjects with Alzheimer's type dementia (<e>DAT</e>), fluent aphasics with a primarily lexical-semantic deficit (FA) and normal subjects. The FA subjects produced twice as many gestures as the normal participants with a normal percentage of gestures that showed semantic features of the lexical items in concurrent speech (iconic). A comparable lexical-semantic deficit together with a deficit in conceptual organisation of information corresponded to a normal gesturing rate in the DAT subjects; however, the percentage of iconic gestures was reduced. Gestures were also analysed in four DAT patients whose communicative performance indicated primarily lexical-semantic (2 patients) or conceptual deficit (2 patients). In the two DAT patients with lexical-semantic deficit, the gesture pattern was like that of the FA patients; in the other two, the pattern of the DAT group was observed. These results agree with previous findings that DAT  empty  speech corresponds to reduced production of gestures showing semantic features (Glosser et al., 1998). However, the comparison between DAT with primarily lexical-semantic or conceptual deficits indicates that the nature of the cognitive impairment underlying poor information content and lack of reference in DAT discourse constrains the production of conversational gestures by patients with this disease. These findings are at variance with the hypothesis of parallel dissolution of speech and gestures in language disorders after brain damage (Cicone et al., 1979; McNeill, 1992; Glosser et al., 1998).",M1
16042028,"Referential communication in Alzheimer's type dementia.This paper investigates factors that underlie reduced informative content and lack of reference in the discourse of patients with Alzheimer's Type Dementia (<e>DAT</e>). Patients with DAT, fluent aphasics and normal controls were given a referential communication task structured to assess lexical encoding of information, pragmatic/conceptual elaboration of information and effectiveness in establishing reference. The subjects also received standardised aphasia tests (CADL, Holland, 1980; and Cookie Theft Picture Description, Nicholas and Brookshire, 1993). Comparable reduction of lexical encoding of information was found in the discourse of aphasic and DAT participants both on the referential communication task measures and on the standardised evaluation with the Cookie Theft Picture Description test. However, the DAT subjects' discourse on the referential communication task was less efficient in establishing reference than that of the aphasics since the former presented more misunderstandings and required more explicit prompts from the listener. Furthermore, the DAT language on the referential communication task contained confounding and irrelevant information; also, the number of these errors correlated negatively with their referring abilities. Results of the CADL test confirmed that the DAT participants had less communicative effectiveness than their lexical deficit alone predicted. Finally, examination of the performance of individual DAT subjects showed that lexical encoding of information could dissociate from effectiveness in making reference. These findings support the view that difficulty in pragmatic/conceptual elaboration of discourse information content plays a substantial role in the development of reduced information content and lack of reference of DAT  empty speech . These results are discussed in the framework of the hypothesis of early attentional/executive impairment in DAT (Perry and Hodges, 1999).",M1
16042022,"When is category specific in Alzheimer's disease?Mixed findings have emerged concerning whether category-specific disorders occur in Alzheimer's disease. Factors that may contribute to these inconsistencies include: ceiling effects/skewed distributions for control data in some studies; differences in the severity of cognitive deficit in patients; and differences in the type of analysis (in particular, if and how controls are used to analyse single case data). We examined picture naming in Alzheimer's patients and matched elderly healthy normal controls in three experiments. These experiments used stimuli that did and did not produce ceiling effects/skewed data in controls. In Experiment 1, we examined for category effects in individual <e>DAT</e> patients using commonly used analyses for single cases (chi2 and z-scores). The different techniques produced quite different outcomes. In Experiment 2a, we used the same techniques on a different group of patients with similar outcomes. Finally, in Experiment 2b, we examined the same patients but (a) used stimuli that did not produce ceiling effects/skewed distributions in healthy controls, and (b) used statistical methods that did not treat the control sample as a population. We found that ceiling effects in controls may markedly inflate the incidence of dissociations in which living things are differentially impaired and seriously underestimate dissociations in the opposite direction. In addition, methods that treat the control sample as a population led to inflation in the overall number of dissociations detected. These findings have implications for the reliability of category effects previously reported both in Alzheimer patients and in other pathologies. In particular, they suggest that the greater proportion of living than nonliving deficits reported in the literature may be an artifact of the methods used.",M1

The introduction of new medications that appear to mediate the insidious progression of the disorder increases the need for timely differentiation of DAT from other dementia-related disorders. The present study examined the relationship between hemispheric differences in regional cerebral blood flow with corresponding lateral neuropsychological processing deficits in patients with DAT. Eighty patients with a diagnosis of DAT were administered Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) scans and a battery of left and right hemisphere neuropsychological-based tasks. The results of ANOVA indicated that patients with DAT who were not suffering from perfusion deficits exhibited significantly fewer neuropsychological deficits than did patients with DAT who had perfusion deficits. The neuropsychological tests that measured verbal ability, logical memory, word-pair learning, reading, arithmetic, and visual-perceptual organization were all significantly lower in the group with perfusion deficits. Further analysis indicated that patients with left hemisphere perfusion deficits tended to have poorer neuropsychological skills than did individuals with right hemisphere perfusion deficits, diffuse perfusion deficits, and no perfusion deficits. A Stepwise Discriminant Analysis was unable to use the neuropsychological variables to classify patients accurately into perfusion deficit groups.",M1

15975086,"Cross-cultural comparison of mild cognitive impairment between China and USA.Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk for dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>), vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy Body (LBD) and Fronto-temporal dementias (FTD). Risk factors and conversion rates of MCI to dementia have not been thoroughly investigated in developing countries. Chinese and English versions of Mini-Mental State Examination were administered serially among well-matched subjects from two clinics located in Xi'an, China and Houston, USA. Subtle cognitive impairments were weighed according to MCI criteria as defined previously. Subjects with MCI were followed for an additional 3 years after their identification. Diagnoses of VaD and DAT were made according to established criteria. During screening period, 73 American and 65 Chinese individuals were identified with MCI. After 3 years of MCI follow-up, of the 73 American MCI subjects, 35 (47.9%) developed DAT and 15 (20.5%) developed VaD. Of the 65 Chinese MCI subjects, 12 (18.5%) developed DAT and 19 (29.2%) developed VaD. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, Chinese MCI subjects, despite their lower educational level, are 1.7 times less likely to progress to DAT and 2.3 times more likely to progress to VaD than American subjects within 3 years of MCI being identified (p&lt;0.01). Data suggest that progression rates of MCI vary considerably among subjects from two countries. American MCI subjects are more prone to DAT, while Chinese subjects are more prone to VaD. Differences in genetic factors, cultures, educational levels, and preventive treatments of vascular risk factors are proposed as responsible for this uneven geographic distribution for different types of dementia.",M1
15959843,"Brain perfusion SPECT in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: comparison of a semiquantitative and a visual evaluation.Due to the increasing importance of early recognition and differential diagnosis of dementias, cerebral perfusion scans using  single photon emission computed tomography  (SPECT) are increasingly integrated into the examination routine. The goal of this study was to check the diagnostic validity of SPECT scans of MCI- and <e>DAT</e>-patients, two subgroups out of 369 persons with etiologically unclear cognitive dysfunction, which underwent an assessment program for probable dementia including cognitive testing, cranial computed tomography, ultrasound, routine laboratory testing including vascular risk factors. After exclusion of patients with no or other forms of dementia we analyzed SPECT data of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 85) and dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT; n = 78) in comparison with a healthy control group (n = 34).Visual assessment as well as a manual  regions of interest  (ROI) regionalization of the cortex were performed, whereby a ROI/cerebellum ratio was calculated as a semi-quantitative value. Association cortex areas were assessed regarding frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of both hemispheres. When comparing the ratios of patients with DAT and controls, we found a statistically significant reduction of the cerebral perfusion in all measured cortex areas (p &lt; 0.001). The comparison of patients with MCI with the selected control group also established a statistically significant difference in the cerebral perfusion for the evaluated cortex areas with the exception of the left hemispheric frontal and parietal cortex.A considerable number of the MCI patients showed an MMSE-score within the normal range, but with regard to the perfusion in the right hemispheric association cortex these patients also could be distinguished unambiguously from controls. Sensitivity levels found by visual assessment were at least as high as those found by the ROI method (pathological assessment: visual 49.4% vs. ROI 47.1% for MCI; visual 75.6% vs. ROI 73.1% for DAT). High experienced visual assessment of cerebral perfusion scans using SPECT provides an useful additional tool in diagnosis of cognitive impairment. The used semiquantitative ROI-method is nearly equivalent and does not depend on the experience of the investigator.",M1
15917103,"Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging of posterior cingulate fiber tracts in mild cognitive impairment.Different processes like microvascular dysfunction, free radical toxicity, beta-amyloid deposits, and Wallerian degeneration can cause functionally relevant disturbances of cerebral neuronal networks by myelin degeneration. Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging (ccDTI) allows the structural identification and quantification of myelinated fiber tracts. Particularly, posterior cingulate fiber tracts, which are regarded as important neuronal substrates of the network representing memory processing can be localized only imprecisely by conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The posterior cingulate bundles were assessed by ccDTI in 17 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (<e>DAT</e>), and 21 age-matched controls. Additionally, DTI values were correlated with memory performance in the delayed verbal recall test. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differed significantly between MCI and controls, as well as between DAT and controls. Performance in the delayed verbal recall test of the entire study group correlated significantly with posterior cingulate bundle anisotropy and diffusivity. Using ccDTI seems, hence, a favorable strategy to detect and quantify the structural integrity of posterior cingulate white matter in MCI. Alterations of DTI parameters substantiate the involvement of white matter pathology in the development of MCI. Moreover, ccDTI could serve as in vivo method to investigate age and disease-related myelin alterations as potential morphological substrates of cognitive dysfunction.",M1

15808979,"Preclinical detection of Alzheimer's disease: hippocampal shape and volume predict dementia onset in the elderly.Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial), which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia, were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years) to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models. When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion. The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects.",M1
15798498,"Pain and agitation in long-term care residents with dementia: use of the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale.AIM: to explore the relationship between total and sub-scores of the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale (PAS) and five proxy measures of pain in long-term care (LTC) residents. STUDY DESIGN: descriptive correlational design. SAMPLE AND SETTING: 58 residents in three LTC facilities in rural Western Canada with moderate to severe cognitive impairment took part in the study. Six full-time registered nurses working in the facilities and three palliative care nurse consultants provided pain and agitation assessments. MEASUREMENTS: registered nurses used PAS to assess agitation. The five proxy measures of pain were the Discomfort Scale for Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DS-<e>DAT</e>), number of pain diagnoses, use of analgesic medications, and pain ratings by both facility nurses and palliative care nurse consultants. RESULTS: there was a moderately strong relationship between total PAS agitation scores and total DS-DAT pain scores (r=0.51, P&lt;0.01). The PAS sub-score  resisting care  was significantly correlated with total DS-DAT scores (r=0.46, P&lt;0.01), and pain ratings by both facility nurses (r=0.48, P&lt;0.01) and palliative care nurse consultants (r=0.51, P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: for certain residents with dementia, PAS may allow assessment of both agitation and uncommunicated pain. It is possible that the PAS form of agitation  resistance to care  may indicate pain that individual cannot otherwise communicate. One possible response to such resistance would be to trial pain medication and reassess agitation. Nursing staff in LTC facilities may need additional training in pain assessment of residents with dementia.",M1

METHODS: High-resolution, high-contrast structural MRIs were obtained from 370 adults (age 18 to 97). Participants over 65 (n = 192) were characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) as either nondemented (CDR 0, n = 94) or with very mild to mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>, CDR 0.5 and 1, n = 98). Of these older participants, 79 belonged to a longitudinal cohort and were imaged again a mean 1.8 years after baseline. Estimates of gray matter (nGM), white matter (nWM), and whole-brain volume (nWBV) normalized for head sizes were generated based on atlas registration and image segmentation. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression of nWBV estimates from nondemented individuals across the adult lifespan revealed a strong linear, moderate quadratic pattern of decline beginning in early adulthood, with later onset of nWM than nGM loss. Whole-brain volume differences were detected by age 30. The cross-sectional atrophy model overlapped with the rates measured longitudinally in older, nondemented individuals (mean decline of -0.45% per year). In those individuals with very mild DAT, atrophy rate more than doubled (-0.98% per year). CONCLUSIONS: Nondemented individuals exhibit a slow rate of whole-brain atrophy from early in adulthood with white-matter loss beginning in middle age; in older adults, the onset of dementia of the Alzheimer type is associated with a markedly accelerated atrophy rate.",M1
15769212,"Context processing and context maintenance in healthy aging and early stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type.Declines in the ability to process context information may represent a fundamental mechanism of age-related cognitive changes. Two components of context processing--activation/updating and maintenance--were examined in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, along with individuals suffering from early stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>). All older adult groups showed context activation/updating impairments, whereas context maintenance was only impaired in the oldest adults (age&gt;75 years) and was further exacerbated in DAT individuals. The results suggest that context processing may be composed of functionally dissociable components and point to the utility of this construct in understanding the timecourse of cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging.",M1
15766770,"Semantic feature knowledge and picture naming in dementia of Alzheimer's type: a new approach.This study addresses continuing controversies concerning the nature of semantic impairment in early dementia of the Alzheimer type (<e>DAT</e>), and the relationship between conceptual knowledge and picture naming. A series of analyses of fine-grained feature knowledge data show that: (1) distinctive features of concepts were more vulnerable than shared; (2) the amount of attribute knowledge about a concept was associated reliably, and in a graded fashion, with the ability to name a picture of that item; (3) sensory features were differentially important in naming; and (4) the degree of disruption to different types of attribute knowledge did not vary between items from living and nonliving domains. These findings are discussed in the context of contemporary cognitive and computational models of semantic memory organisation.",M1
15760630,"MRI identifies MCI subtypes: vascular versus neurodegenerative.As life expectancy increases worldwide, pandemics of cognitive impairment and dementia are emerging as major public health problems. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prodromal for dementia, is a descriptive term used for those clinical states showing early and subtle cognitive decline among the elderly, preceding the dementias. Psychometric screening combining Mini-Mental Status (MMSE) and Cognitive Capacity Screening (CCSE) Examinations, when combined now called CMC with C standing for Combined, M for MMSE, and C for CCSE, confirms diagnosis of MCI. Individuals identified with MCI are at increased risk for dementia of Alzheimer's type (<e>DAT</e>), vascular dementia (VAD) and other rare neurodegenerative dementias, including Lewy body dementia (LBD), fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Depending on different clinical compositions of cohorts studied, and MCI criteria used, between 19% and 50% of MCI progress to dementia within 3-5 years, two thirds to Alzheimer's (DAT) and one third to vascular types (VAD) in the United States. Not all Parkinsonians become demented, but PDD develops in 20-30%, however, PDD subjects were excluded from the present study, as were LBD and FTD. The incidence of MCI in those over age 70, with confirmed cognitive declines when tested 2 years later, is around 23%, but some spontaneously improve.",M1
20384817,"Mouse strain differences in locomotor, sensitisation and rewarding effect of heroin; association with alterations in MOP-r activation and dopamine transporter binding.There is growing agreement that genetic factors play an important role in the risk to develop heroin addiction, and comparisons of heroin addiction vulnerability in inbred strains of mice could provide useful information on the question of individual vulnerability to heroin addiction. This study examined the rewarding and locomotor-stimulating effects of heroin in male C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Heroin induced locomotion and sensitisation in C57BL/6J but not in DBA/2J mice. C57BL/6J mice developed conditioned place preference (CPP) to the highest doses of heroin, while DBA/2J showed CPP to only the lowest heroin doses, indicating a higher sensitivity of DBA/2J mice to the rewarding properties of heroin vs C57BL/6J mice. In order to investigate the neurobiological substrate underlying some of these differences, the effect of chronic 'intermittent' escalating dose heroin administration on the opioid, dopaminergic and stress systems was explored. Twofold higher mu-opioid receptor (MOP-r)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was observed in the nucleus accumbens and caudate of saline-treated C57BL/6J mice compared with DBA/2J. Heroin decreased MOP-r density in brain regions of C57BL/6J mice, but not in DBA/2J. A higher density of dopamine transporters (<e>DAT</e>) was observed in nucleus accumbens shell and caudate of heroin-treated DBA/2J mice compared with heroin-treated C57BL/6J. There were no effects on D1 and D2 binding. Chronic heroin administration decreased corticosterone levels in both strains with no effect of strain. These results suggest that genetic differences in MOP-r activation and DAT expression may be responsible for individual differences in vulnerability to heroin addiction.",M2
20074437,"Candidate-gene approach in fibromyalgia syndrome: association analysis of the genes encoding substance P receptor, dopamine transporter and alpha1-antitrypsin.BACKGROUND: Substance P receptor modulates stress, depression, anxiety and pain. Substance P is increased in CSF of fibromyalgia (FMS) patients. We examined the frequency of the substance P receptor (TACR1) 1354 G&gt;C polymorphism in FMS.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) SLC6A3 3' variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism is associated with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition with clinical and epidemiological overlap with FMS. We have evaluated the allele frequency of this polymorphism in FMS.Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease. The PI ZZ phenotype, encoded by the E342K mutation, is associated with emphysema and liver disease, and has been linked with FMS. We have examined the frequency of this mutation in FMS. METHODS: Eighty-seven Jewish FMS patients participated; 45 of Ashkenazi origin, 32 of non-Ashkenazi origin and 10 of unknown or mixed Jewish origin. Controls consisted of 200 healthy Jewish individuals. Genotyping of the 1354G &gt;C allele in the 3' UTR of TACR1 gene was performed by DdeI restriction analysis, genotyping the SCL6A3 DAT 3' VNTR polymorphism was performed by PCR combined with GeneScan analysis, and the AAT E342K mutation was identified by TaqI restriction analysis. RESULTS: No significant association was found between FMS and the three genetic markers studied here. CONCLUSIONS: The current candidate-gene approach study failed to identify significant associations between FMS and three genetic markers with hypothesis-driven clinical relevance. We suggest that a genome-wide association study would be a more fruitful approach for further investigation of the genetic basis of FMS.",M2
20211696,"Methylphenidate normalizes elevated dopamine transporter densities in an animal model of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined type, but not to the same extent in one of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattentive type.The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR/NCrl) is a validated model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined subtype, whereas a recently identified substrain of the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY/NCrl) is a model of ADHD inattentive subtype. In this study, we first examined the expression of genes involved in dopamine signaling and metabolism in the dorsal striatum and ventral mesencephalon of these two rat strains, as well as three reference control strains (WKY/NHsd, WK/HanTac, and SD/NTac) using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Next, striatal dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) density was determined by ligand binding assay in the two ADHD-like strains at different developmental stages and after methylphenidate treatment. In adult rats, the mRNA expression of DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase was elevated in SHR/NCrl and WKY/NCrl rats compared to control strains, with differences between SHR/NCrl and WKY/NCrl rats also evident. During normal development, changes of striatal DAT densities occurred in both strains with lower densities in WKY/NCrl compared to SHR/NCrl after day 25. Two-weeks methylphenidate treatment during different developmental stages was associated with decreased striatal DAT density in both rat strains compared to the non-treated rats with more pronounced effects followed prepubertal treatment. These results suggest differences in the pathophysiology of the combined versus the predominantly inattentive animal model of ADHD. Finally, treatment with methylphenidate might reduce elevated DAT levels more effectively in the combined subtype especially when applied before puberty.",M2
20201860,"Regulation of the dopamine transporter: aspects relevant to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.Dopaminergic signaling in the brain is primarily modulated by dopamine transporters (<e>DATs</e>), which actively translocate extraneuronal dopamine back into dopaminergic neurons. Transporter proteins are highly dynamic, continuously trafficking between plasmalemmal and endosomal membranes. Changes in DAT membrane trafficking kinetics can rapidly regulate dopaminergic tone by altering the number of transporters present at the cell surface. Various psychostimulant DAT ligands-acting either as amphetamine-like substrates or cocaine-like nontranslocated inhibitors-affect transporter trafficking, triggering rapid insertion or removal of plasmalemmal DATs. In this review, we focus on the effects of psychostimulants of addiction (particularly D-methamphetamine and cocaine) on DAT regulation and membrane trafficking, with an emphasis on how these drugs may influence intracellular signaling cascades and transporter-associated scaffolding proteins to affect DAT regulation. In addition, we consider involvement of presynaptic receptors for dopamine and other ligands in DAT regulation. Finally, we discuss possible implications of transporter regulation to the putative toxicity of several substituted amphetamine derivatives commonly used as recreational drugs, as well as to the design of therapeutics for cocaine addiction.",M2
20199208,"Complementary acupuncture in Parkinson's disease: a spect study.We studied cerebral effects of complementary acupuncture in Parkinson's disease using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measures of 99mTc-ECD and 99mTc-TRODAT-4, before and after five weeks of treatment. Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive levodopa alone (controls) or levodopa and complementary scalp electro-acupuncture. Before treatment, no hemispheric regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) differences were found, whereas striatal dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) activity was lower in the most affected hemisphere. Treatment with levodopa alone did not change rCBF, whereas it increased basal ganglion DAT activity in the most affected hemisphere. Patients who received levodopa and complementary acupuncture had increased rCBF in the frontal lobe, the occipital lobe, the basal ganglion, and the cerebellum in the most affected hemisphere as compared to baseline, but there were no changes in basal ganglia DAT levels. Thus, complementary acupuncture treatment in Parkinson's disease may affect rCBF but not basal ganglion DAT.",M2
20184806,"Correlation between errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the availability of striatal dopamine transporters in healthy volunteers.BACKGROUND: Although studies have indicated that the frontal lobe plays an important role in performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and that basal ganglia play a specific role in frontal lobe function, the role of striatal dopamine (DA) activity in performance on the WCST remains unclear. METHODS: We assessed the relation between the availability of striatal dopamine transporters (<e>DATs</e>) and performance on the WCST as a measure of executive function in healthy individuals. We approximated the availability of DATs in 53 healthy volunteers aged 19-61 years by use of single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m (99mTc)-TRODAT-1 as the ligand. The WCST was administered to all participants. RESULTS: The availability of DAT was significantly negatively correlated with perseverative errors on the WCST, both before and after adjustment for body mass index (r(before) = -0.39, p = 0.004; r(after) = -0.39, p = 0.005). LIMITATIONS: This was an association study; thus, a causal relation between DAT availability and performance cannot be confirmed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that striatal DAT availability may play a role in executive function as measured by the WCST.",M2
20175408,"Dopamine transporter regulation during four nights of REM sleep deprivation followed by recovery--an in vivo molecular imaging study in humans.OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of total or selective REM sleep deprivation on the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) densities and sleep patterns of healthy volunteers. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Evaluation of polysomnography recordings and DAT density after 4 nights of selective REM sleep deprivation followed by 3 nights of sleep recovery compared to a control group and a group that was subjected to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation. Single positron emission computed tomography and [99mTc]TRODAT-1 were used to assess the cerebral DAT density in the striatum at baseline, after REM sleep deprivation and total sleep deprivation as well as after sleep recovery. Blood was collected daily to examine prolactin and estradiol levels, which were correlated with dopaminergic activity. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Thirty healthy male volunteers ranging from 19 to 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups after giving written informed consent (10 non-sleep deprived, 10 total sleep deprived, and 10 REM sleep deprived). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Four nights of REM sleep deprivation and 2 nights of total sleep deprivation induced distinct and heterogeneous patterns of sleep recovery. No significant modulation of DAT availability was observed within groups. In the recovery nights, changes in cortisol, prolactin and estradiol concentrations were significantly correlated with specific sleep stages in the total and REM sleep deprived groups. In addition, DAT density was positively correlated with estradiol concentration and inversely associated with SWS latency only after total sleep deprivation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that although sleep deprivation did not promote significant alterations in DAT density within the striatum, there were significant correlations among transporter availability, hormonal concentrations and sleep parameters.",M2

20169576,"Prenatal and postnatal exposure to bisphenol a induces anxiolytic behaviors and cognitive deficits in mice.Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine-disrupting chemical, has been extensively evaluated for reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. However, little is known about the behavioral and neurochemical effects of BPA exposure. This study examined whether chronic daily exposure to an environmental endocrine-disrupting chemical, bisphenol A [(BPA); 100 microg/kg/day or 500 microg/kg/day, p.o.], from prenatal Day 7 to postnatal Day 36 would lead to changes in anxiety and memory in mice. First, we observed the behavioral alterations of BPA-treated mice using two anxiety-related models, the open field test and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. In the open field test, BPA treatment (100 microg/kg/day) increased movement in the central zone. BPA treatment (500 microg/kg/day) also increased the time spent in the open arms in the EPM test. Second, we measured cognitive ability in the Y-maze test and novel object test. BPA-treated mice showed decreased alternation behavior in the Y-maze at both of doses, indicating working memory impairment. BPA-treated mice (100 microg/kg/day) also showed decreased novel object recognition as expressed by central locomotion and frequency in the central zone, showing recognition memory impairment. Finally, to measure changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems in the brain, we performed autoradiographic receptor binding assays for dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, the NMDA receptor, and the dopamine transporter. BPA treatment increased D(2) receptor binding in the caudate putamen (CPu) but decreased <e>DAT</e> binding. BPA treatment also decreased NMDA receptor binding in the frontal cortex and CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term BPA exposure in mice can induce anxiolytic behaviors, cognitive deficits and changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems.",M2
20167208,"Motivational effects on interval timing in dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) knockdown mice.We examined interval timing in mice that underexpress the dopamine transporter (DAT) and have chronically higher levels of extracellular dopamine (Zhuang et al., 2001). The dopaminergic system has been proposed as a neural substrate for an internal clock, with transient elevations of dopaminergic activity producing underestimation of temporal intervals. A group of DAT knockdown (KD) and littermate wild type (WT) mice were tested with a dual peak procedure. Mice obtained reinforcement by pressing one of two levers after a fixed amount of time (30 or 45 s) had elapsed since lever extension. Only one lever was available at a time, and each lever was associated with a single duration. On occasional probe trials, the DAT KD mice began responding earlier in the interval than WT mice, but showed maximal responding and terminated responding around the same time as the WT mice. Administration of raclopride (0.2, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg), a D2 antagonist, eliminated most of the differences between DAT KD and WT mice, suggesting that the effects of chronic DAT downregulation on interval timing were mediated by the D2 receptors. Another cohort of DAT KD mice was trained on a visual attention task, and no deficits were observed, confirming that the changes in timed behavior were not attentionally mediated. Our data are consistent with the view that tonic dopamine affects the sensitivity of an organism to external reward signals, and that this increased motivation for reward of DAT KD mice lowers the threshold for initiating responding in a timing task.",M2
20157861,"Age-associated striatal dopaminergic denervation and falls in community-dwelling subjects.Older adults have a high prevalence of gait and balance disturbances and falls. Normal aging is associated with significant striatal dopaminergic denervation, which might be a previously unrecognized additional contributor to geriatric falls. This study investigated the relationship between the severity of age-associated striatal dopaminergic denervation (AASDD) and falls in community-dwelling subjects. Community-dwelling subjects who did not have a clinical diagnosis to explain falls (n = 77: 43 female, 34 male; mean age 61.4 +/- 16.4; range 20-85) completed clinical assessment and brain dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) [(11)C]beta-CFT (2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane) positron emission tomography imaging followed by 6 months of prospective fall monitoring using diaries. Results showed a significant inverse relationship between striatal DAT activity and age (r = -0.82, p &lt; 0.001). A total of 26 subjects (33.8%) reported at least one fall, with 5 subjects (6.5%) reporting two or more falls. While no significant difference was noted in striatal DAT activity between nonfallers (n = 51) and fallers (n = 26; f = 0.02, not significant), striatal DAT activity was modestly reduced in the small subgroup of recurrent fallers compared with the other subjects (f = 5.07, p &lt; 0.05). Findings indicate that AASDD does not explain isolated self-reported falls in community-dwelling subjects. However, it may be a contributing factor in the small subgroup of subjects with recurrent falls.",M2
20156526,"Prosurvival effect of human wild-type alpha-synuclein on MPTP-induced toxicity to central but not peripheral catecholaminergic neurons isolated from transgenic mice.In the present work we report the generation of a new line of alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) transgenic mice in which the human wild-type alpha-SYN cDNA is expressed under the control of a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. We provide evidence that the ectopic protein is found in TH expressing neurons of both central and peripheral nervous systems. The transgene is expressed very early in development coinciding with the activity of the TH promoter and in the adult brain the human protein distributes normally to the nerve endings and cell bodies of dopaminergic nigral neurons without any evidence of abnormal aggregation. Our results indicate that expression of human wild-type alpha-SYN does not affect normal development or maintenance of TH immunoreactive nigral neurons, striatal dopamine content, or locomotor activity. Systemic administration of the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces a loss of TH immunoreactive nigral neurons and terminals and of dopamine levels to the same degree in both transgenic and non-transgenic adult mice. Intoxication also results in a similar loss of cardiac noradrenaline in both genotypes. Surprisingly, cultured transgenic ventral mesencephalic fetal dopaminergic neurons exhibit complete resistance to cell death induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)) intoxication, without changes in dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) surface levels. Interestingly, this protection is not observed in other populations of catecholaminergic neurons such as peripheral sympathetic neurons, despite their high sensitivity to MPP(+)in vitro.",M2

The availability of DAT was approximated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [99mTc] TRODAT-1.

20144661,"Maternal deprivation-caused behavioral abnormalities in adult rats relate to a non-methylation-regulated D2 receptor levels in the nucleus accumbens.In this study we investigated the effects of maternal deprivation on adult rats' spatial learning and memory, exploratory, and limbic activity and their correlations with the gene expression of dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and dopamine D1, D2, D3 receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We further investigated whether DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of DRD2 gene expression. Results from our behavioral tests demonstrated that maternal deprivation significantly decreased the spatial learning and memory ability, exploratory ability, and limbic activity in adult rats, while results from our molecular analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of DAT, DRD1, DRD2, and DRD3 were significantly downregulated in maternally deprived rats in comparison to control animals. Correlation analysis in the maternally deprived rats suggested that downregulated DAT and DRD2 mRNA levels significantly correlated with the amount of time required to find the platform, but only DRD2 significantly correlated with the time spent in target quadrant in the Morris water-maze test; DAT, DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA levels significantly correlated with the number of vertical activity, but only DRD2 mRNA level significantly correlated with total distance in the open field test. Conversely, DRD3 mRNA level did not display any correlation with behavioral changes. The methylated CpG levels in the promoter region of DRD2 gene and the expression of DNA methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) and 3alpha (Dnmt3alpha) were not significantly changed in maternal deprivation group in comparison to the control group. We concluded that downregulation of DAT, DRD1 and DRD2 gene expression in the NAc is in response to the abnormality in exploratory behaviors; downregulation of DAT and DRD2 expression is in response to the abnormality in spatial learning; downregulation of DRD2 is in response to the abnormality in the spatial memory in maternally deprived rats; whereas DRD3 plays no role in these behaviors. DNA methylation might not be the mechanism to regulate the mRNA level.",M2
20141527,"The role of the dopamine transporter DAT1 genotype on the neural correlates of cognitive flexibility.Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt goal-oriented behaviour in response to changing environmental demands, varies widely amongst individuals, yet its underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. Neuropharmacological and human clinical studies have suggested a critical role for striatal dopaminergic function mediated by the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>). The present study aimed at revealing the role of the DAT in the individual brain response stereotypy underlying cognitive flexibility. A task-switching protocol was administered to a sample divided according to the presence or absence of the 9-repeat (9R) allele of the DAT1 polymorphism, while registering behavioural and electrophysiological novelty-P3 responses. The absence of the 9R (higher gene expression) is related to less striatal DA availability. Individuals lacking the 9R (9R-) showed specific response time (RT) increases for sensory change and task-set reconfiguration, as well as brain modulations not observed in participants with the 9R allele (9R+), suggesting that task performance of the former group depended on immediate local context. In contrast, individuals displaying high striatal DA showed larger RT costs than 9R- individuals to any sensory change, with no further increase for task-set reconfiguration, and a larger early positive brain response irrespective of the task condition, probably reflecting larger inhibition of any previous interference as well as stronger activation of the current task set. However, the polymorphic groups did not differ in their mean RTs in trials requiring task-set reconfiguration. This distinct stereotypy of cerebral responses reveals different patterns of cognitive control according to the DAT1 gene polymorphism.",M2
20133946,"Ethanol alters endosomal recycling of human dopamine transporters.Dynamic membrane trafficking of the monoamine dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) regulates dopaminergic signaling. Various intrinsic and pharmacological modulators can alter this trafficking. Previously we have shown ethanol potentiates in vitro DAT function and increases surface expression. However, the mechanism underlying these changes is unclear. In the present study, we found ethanol directly regulates DAT function by altering endosomal recycling of the transporter. We defined ethanol action on transporter regulation by [(3)H]DA uptake functional analysis combined with biochemical and immunological assays in stably expressing DAT HEK-293 cells. Short-term ethanol exposure potentiated DAT function in a concentration-, but not time-dependent manner. This potentiation was accompanied by a parallel increase in DAT surface expression. Ethanol had no effect on function or surface localization of the ethanol-insensitive mutant (G130T DAT), suggesting a trafficking-dependent mechanism in mediating the ethanol sensitivity of the transporter. The ethanol-induced increase in DAT surface expression occurred without altering the overall size of DAT endosomal recycling pools. We found ethanol increased the DAT membrane insertion rate while having no effect on internalization of the transporter. Ethanol had no effect on the surface expression or trafficking of the endogenously expressing transferrin receptor, suggesting ethanol does not have a nonspecific effect on endosomal recycling. These results define a novel trafficking mechanism by which ethanol regulates DAT function.",M2
20132929,"Action of modafinil--increased motivation via the dopamine transporter inhibition and D1 receptors?BACKGROUND: Modafinil is prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy. It has been postulated that modafinil might treat cognitive disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders. The mechanisms underlying such modafinil-induced improvements in performance have yet to be delineated however. Recent evidence suggests that modafinil might block the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) might contribute to modafinil effects. METHODS: Dopamine D1R wildtype (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice received vehicle, modafinil, or the selective DAT blocker GBR12909 in a progressive ratio breakpoint study. RESULTS: Both modafinil and GBR12909 increased motivation in the task as measured by an increase in breakpoint in WT and HT mice. These drug-induced increases in motivation were reduced in dopamine D1R HT mice relative to their WT littermates. The D1R KO mice did not respond in the task. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that modafinil increases motivation. Moreover, given the similarity of effects with GBR12909, the data corroborate evidence that the behavioral effects of modafinil might be due to DAT inhibition. Furthermore, the dopamine D1R might play a downstream role in mediating modafinil-induced increases in motivation. Thus, studies reporting cognition-enhancing effects of modafinil might have been influenced by its ability to increase motivation.",M2
20132487,"Function of dopamine transporter is compromised in DYT1 transgenic animal model in vivo.Early onset torsion dystonia (DYT1), the most common form of hereditary primary dystonia, is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene, which codes for the protein, torsinA. We previously examined the effect of the human mutant torsinA on striatal dopaminergic function in a conventional transgenic mouse model of DYT1 dystonia (hMT1), in which human mutant torsinA is expressed under the cytomegalovirus promotor. Systemic administration of amphetamine did not increase dopamine (DA) release as efficiently in these mice as compared with wild-type transgenic and non-transgenic mice. We, now, studied the contribution of the DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) to amphetamine-induced DA release in hMT1 transgenic mice using in vivo no-net flux microdialysis. This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period. The slope (extraction fraction) is the measure of the DAT activity in vivo. The slope for hMT1 transgenic mice was 0.58 +/- 0.07 and for non-transgenic animals, 0.87 +/- 0.06 (p &lt; 0.05). We further investigated the efficacy of nomifensine (a specific DAT inhibitor) in inhibiting amphetamine-induced DA release. Local application of nomifensine 80 min before the systemic application of amphetamine inhibited DA release in both transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates. The efficiency of the inhibition appeared to be different, with mean values of 48% for hMT1 transgenic mice versus 84% for non-transgenic littermates. Moreover, we have evaluated basal and amphetamine-induced locomotion in hMT1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates, using an O-maze behavioral chamber. Basal levels of locomotion in the hMT1 transgenic mice showed that they moved much less than their non-transgenic littermates (0.9 +/- 0.3 m for transgenic mice vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 m for non-transgenic littermates, p &lt; 0.05). This relative reduction in locomotion was also observed following amphetamine administration (48.5 +/- 6.7 m for transgenics vs. 73.7 +/- 9.8 m for non-transgenics, p &lt; 0.05). These results support the finding that there are altered dynamics of DA release and reuptake in hMT1 transgenic mice in vivo, with DAT activity is reduced in the presence of mutant torsinA, which is consistent with behavioral consequences such as reduced locomotion and (previously described) abnormal motor phenotypes such as increased hind-base width and impaired performance on the raised-beam task. These data implies that altered DAT function may contribute to impaired DA neurotransmission and clinical symptoms in human DYT1 dystonia.",M2
20083001,"Diagnosing premotor Parkinson's disease using a two-step approach combining olfactory testing and <e>DAT</e> SPECT imaging.Extranigral neuropathological changes may precede the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones in Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, non-motor disturbances are an interesting target for the development of tests aimed at identifying individuals with premotor PD. An impaired sense of smell occurs with high prevalence in the clinical motor stages of PD patients and has also been reported in first-degree relatives of PD patients. In a prospective study in 361 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of PD patients, we studied the value of a two-step approach, combining olfactory testing and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, in detecting patients in the premotor phase of PD. Unexplained hyposmia alone was associated with a 12.5% risk of developing PD within a five year period. Cox regression analysis revealed that odour discrimination performance was most strongly correlated with the risk of future PD. Furthermore, all relatives that later developed PD had both hyposmia and abnormally reduced striatal DAT binding at baseline. The results of our studies provide the proof-of-principle that a two-step approach of olfactory testing and DAT SPECT imaging may serve to diagnose PD in its premotor phase. Yet, the low positive predictive value of hyposmia indicates that a wider application of this approach for screening purposes would require too many DAT SPECT scans in healthy individuals. Therefore, future studies in larger populations are necessary to further characterize premotor PD and identify additional genetic and/or clinical susceptibility markers to be used in conjunction with olfactory testing as additional screening steps toward diagnosing PD in its earliest stages.",M2

20085610,"Regulation of dopamine transporter function by protein-protein interactions: new discoveries and methodological challenges.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) plays a key role in regulating dopaminergic signalling in the brain by mediating rapid clearance of dopamine from the synaptic clefts. The psychostimulatory actions of cocaine and amphetamine are primarily the result of a direct interaction of these compounds with DAT leading to attenuated dopamine clearance and for amphetamine even increased dopamine release. In the last decade, intensive efforts have been directed towards understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the activity and availability of DAT in the plasma membrane of the pre-synaptic neurons. This has led to the identification of a plethora of different kinases, receptors and scaffolding proteins that interact with DAT and hereby either modulate the catalytic activity of the transporter or regulate its trafficking and degradation. Several new tools for studying DAT regulation in live cells have also recently become available such as fluorescently tagged cocaine analogues and fluorescent substrates. Here we review the current knowledge about the role of protein-protein interactions in DAT regulation as well as we describe the most recent methodological developments that have been established to overcome the challenges associated with the study of DAT in endogenous systems.",M2
20079719,"The effect of estrogen on dopamine and serotonin receptor and transporter levels in the brain: an autoradiography study.The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of estrogen on dopaminergic and serotonergic regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI) by measuring its effects on the density of dopamine transporters (<e>DAT</e>), dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, serotonin transporters (SERT), serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) and 5-HT(2A) receptors using radioligand binding autoradiography. Three groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were compared: sham-operated controls, untreated ovariectomized (OVX) rats and OVX rats with a 17beta-estradiol implant (OVX+E). These groups were identical to our previous prepulse inhibition (PPI) studies, allowing comparison of the results. Results showed that in the nucleus accumbens, DAT levels were 44% lower in OVX rats than in intact controls. Estrogen treatment completely reversed the effect of OVX in this brain region to levels similar to those in intact controls. Dopamine D(2) receptor density was increased in OVX rats by 28% in the nucleus accumbens and 25% in the caudate nucleus compared to intact controls. Estrogen treatment reversed this increase and, in addition, reduced dopamine D(2) receptor levels by a further 25% and 20%, respectively, compared to intact control rats. There were no differences between the groups with respect to the densities of dopamine D(1) receptors, SERT, 5-HT(1A) receptors or 5-HT(2A) receptors. These results show effects of estrogen treatment on central indices of dopaminergic, but not serotonergic function. The observed changes do not provide a direct overlap with the effects of these estrogen treatment protocols on drug-induced disruptions of PPI, but it is possible that a combination of effects, i.e. on both DAT and dopamine D(2) receptor density, is involved. These data could also be relevant for our understanding of the potential protective effect of estrogen treatment in schizophrenia.",M2
20079141,"Toxic influence of chronic oral administration of paraquat on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in C57BL/6 mice.BACKGROUND: Paraquat (PQ; 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium), a widely used herbicide, has been repeatedly suggested as a potential etiologic factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), owing to its structural similarity to the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). This study aimed to observe the influence of paraquat on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: A total of 24 male C57BL/6 mice were assigned randomly to 3 groups: control group (treated by saline), PQ treated group, and MPTP treated group. Mice in PQ treated group were taken orally with PQ (10 mg/kg) daily for four months. Locomotor activity was measured. Level of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites levels in the striatum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons were detected by using immunohistochemistry. At the same time, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in substantia nigra were measured by spectrophotometry. mRNA expression of dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra was also determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR technique. RESULTS: Locomotor activities were significantly impaired in the PQ treated group. Level of DA and its metabolites levels in the striatum were declined. The activities of SOD and GSH-PX were decreased, and the content of MDA was increased in PQ treated mice compared with that in control group. Numbers of TH positive neurons and the mRNA expression of DAT in substantia nigra of mice were also decreased after PQ taken orally for four months. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that chronic oral administration of PQ could trigger dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Oxidative stress could be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of PD induced by PQ.",M2
20077428,"Mice expressing the A53T mutant form of human alpha-synuclein exhibit hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behavior.Genetic mutations associated with alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) are implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is primarily a movement disorder, but patients are known to experience anxiety and other mood disorders. In this study, we examined the effect of the hA53T mutation during development by analyzing the protein expression of norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), and dopamine (<e>DAT</e>) transporters in addition to assessing locomotor and anxiety-like behavior. We observed significant decreases in DAT expression at 8 months in transgenic animals compared with normal and younger mice. We used the elevated plus maze, open-field test, and rotarod apparatus to evaluate wild-type and hA53T hemizygous mice at 2, 8, and 12 months of age. Our results showed that 12-month-old transgenic mice spend more time in the open arms and display a greater number of open entries of the elevated plus maze compared with wild-type controls and younger mice. Open-field test results showed that 12-month-old mice travel a greater distance overall and travel more in the inner zone than either wild-type or younger mice. Rotarod testing showed that 8- and 12-month-old transgenic mice perform better than either wild-type controls or younger mice. Overall, 8-12-month-old transgenic mice showed a trend toward reduced anxiety-like behavior and increased hyperactivity. These results indicate a possible role of the A53T alpha-Syn mutation in anxiety-like and hyperactive behaviors in a PD mouse model, suggesting that these behaviors might be comorbid with this disease.",M2
20074615,"Nicotine stimulates transcriptional activity of the human dopamine transporter gene.Nicotine modulates dopaminergic activity in the central nervous system by acting on the reuptake system, including the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>), although precisely remains unclear. Here we investigated the effect of nicotine on the transcriptional regulation of the human DAT (hDAT) gene by conducting luciferase reporter assays. Nicotine enhanced the transcription of hDAT gene constructs in transiently transfected SK-N-SH cells. Hexamethonium, a neuronal (ganglionic) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, blocked the action of nicotine. Functional analyses placed the nicotine-responsive region -3.5 to -1.0 kb (from the transcription start site) upstream of the core promotor region. Deletion of intron 1, known as a silencer element of the hDAT gene, abolished nicotine's stimulatory effect. Nicotine failed to stimulate DAT promotor activity in non-neuronal CHO or COS-7 cells or in SK-N-AS cells, another neuronal cell line recently reported as a model for investigating DAT gene expression. These results suggest a nicotinic cholinergic mechanism to be involved in the nicotine-induced up-regulation of DAT gene expression.",M2
20067583,"Bivalent phenethylamines as novel dopamine transporter inhibitors: evidence for multiple substrate-binding sites in a single transporter.Bivalent ligands--compounds incorporating two receptor-interacting moieties linked by a flexible chain--often exhibit profoundly enhanced binding affinity compared with their monovalent components, implying concurrent binding to multiple sites on the target protein. It is generally assumed that neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) proteins, such as the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>), contain a single domain responsible for recognition of substrate molecules. In this report, we show that molecules possessing two substrate-like phenylalkylamine moieties linked by a progressively longer aliphatic spacer act as progressively more potent DAT inhibitors (rather than substrates). One compound bearing two dopamine (DA)-like pharmacophoric 'heads' separated by an 8-carbon linker achieved an 82-fold gain in inhibition of [(3)H] 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (CFT) binding compared with DA itself; bivalent compounds with a 6-carbon linker and heterologous combinations of DA-, amphetamine- and beta-phenethylamine-like heads all resulted in considerable and comparable gains in DAT affinity. A series of short-chain bivalent-like compounds with a single N-linkage was also identified, the most potent of which displayed a 74-fold gain in binding affinity. Computational modelling of the DAT protein and docking of the two most potent bivalent (-like) ligands suggested simultaneous occupancy of two discrete substrate-binding domains. Assays with the DAT mutants W84L and D313N--previously employed by our laboratory to probe conformation-specific binding of different structural classes of DAT inhibitors--indicated a bias of the bivalent ligands for inward-facing transporters. Our results strongly indicate the existence of multiple DAT substrate-interaction sites, implying that it is possible to design novel types of DAT inhibitors based upon the 'multivalent ligand' strategy.",M2
20061077,"Degenerative parkinsonism in patients with psychogenic parkinsonism: A dopamine transporter imaging study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate patients with  clinically established  psychogenic parkinsonism (PsyP) using single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) with the technetium-99m labeled tracer TRODAT-1, a dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) ligand, and investigate whether these patients have an underlying degenerative parkinsonism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with PsyP were assessed using demographic data, standard clinical scales for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and a neuropsychiatric interview. DAT imaging using SPECT with TRODAT-1 was performed, and values for caudate/putamen DAT binding potentials (BP) registered. Patients with PsyP were matched with PD (n=5) and healthy control subjects (n=5). RESULTS: The mean age (years-old) at first evaluation in the PsyP group was 37.4+/-3.7, and the mean disease duration (years) was 3.9+/-1.2. DAT BPs (means+/-standard deviations) on right/left caudate were, respectively, 0.69+/-0.18 and 0.70+/-0.18 in the PD group versus 1.17+/-0.06 and 1.12+/-0.10 in the control group. DAT BPs on right/left putamen were, respectively, 0.48+/-0.10 and 0.45+/-0.06 in the PD group versus 1.10+/-0.10 and 1.21+/-0.43 in the control group. Two out of five patients from the PsyP group had values for DAT BP in the putamen under the cut-off (&lt; or =0.70) for controls, implying pre-synaptic dopaminergic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Our data in this small group of patients suggest that DAT imaging is a tool that may help in the identification of underlying degenerative parkinsonism in PsyP.",M2
20051513,"Lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the dopamine transporter requires WW3 and WW4 domains of Nedd4-2 and UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.RNA interference screen previously revealed that a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, neuronal precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-2 (Nedd4-2), is necessary for ubiquitination and endocytosis of the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) induced by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). To further confirm the role of Nedd4-2 in DAT ubiquitination and endocytosis, we demonstrated that the depletion of Nedd4-2 by two different small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes suppressed PKC-dependent ubiquitination and endocytosis of DAT in human and porcine cells, whereas knock-down of a highly homologous E3 ligase, Nedd4-1, had no effect on DAT. The abolished DAT ubiquitination in Nedd4-2-depleted cells was rescued by expression of recombinant Nedd4-2. Moreover, overexpression of Nedd4-2 resulted in increased PKC-dependent ubiquitination of DAT. Mutational inactivation of the HECT domain of Nedd4-2 inhibited DAT ubiquitination and endocytosis. Structure-function analysis of Nedd4-2-mediated DAT ubiquitination revealed that the intact WW4 domain and to a lesser extent WW3 domain are necessary for PKC-dependent DAT ubiquitination. Moreover, a fragment of the Nedd4-2 molecule containing WW3, WW4, and HECT domains was sufficient for fully potentiating PKC-dependent ubiquitination of DAT. Analysis of DAT ubiquitination using polyubiquitin chain-specific antibodies showed that DAT is mainly conjugated with Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains. siRNA analysis demonstrated that this polyubiquitination is mediated by Nedd4-2 cooperation with UBE2D and UBE2L3 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The model is proposed whereby each ubiquitinated DAT molecule is modified by a single four-ubiquitin Lys(63)-linked chain that can be conjugated to various lysine residues of DAT.",M2
20050977,"The endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, inhibits dopamine transporter function by a receptor-independent mechanism.The endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA), modulates the activity of the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) in heterologous cells and synaptosomal preparations. The cellular mechanisms mediating this effect are unknown. The present studies employed live cell imaging techniques and the fluorescent, high affinity DAT substrate, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)-styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)), to address this issue. AEA addition to EM4 cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein-tagged human DAT (hDAT) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ASP(+) accumulation (IC(50): 3.2 +/- 0.8 microM). This effect occurred within 1 min after AEA addition and persisted for 10 min thereafter. Pertussis toxin did not attenuate the effects of AEA suggesting a mechanism independent of G(i)/G(o) coupled receptors. The amidohydrolase inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM), failed to alter the AEA-evoked inhibition of ASP(+) accumulation. Methanandamide (10 microM), a metabolically stable analogue of AEA inhibited accumulation but arachidonic acid (10 microM) was without effect suggesting that the effects of AEA are not mediated by its metabolic products. The extent of AEA inhibition of ASP(+) accumulation was not altered in cells pre-treated with 1 microM URB597, a specific and potent fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 microM) Live cell imaging revealed a significant redistribution of hDAT from the membrane to the cytosol in response to AEA treatment (10 microM; 10 min). Similarly biotinylation experiments revealed that the decrease in DAT function was associated with a reduction in hDAT cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that AEA modulates DAT function via a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism and suggest that AEA may produces this effect, in part, by modulating DAT trafficking.",M2
20049490,"Response to methylphenidate is not influenced by DAT1 polymorphisms in a sample of Brazilian adult patients with ADHD.Several lines of evidence suggest a relevant role for the dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene not only as a susceptibility factor for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but also as a predictor of individual methylphenidate (MPH) response. Pharmacogenetic studies of MPH response in ADHD have mainly focused on the 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of DAT1. Most studies were performed in samples of children and conflicting findings were obtained. Only two studies have assessed 3'-VNTR in samples of adults-one with positive and the other with negative findings. In the present study, we investigate three potentially relevant polymorphisms in DAT1 gene (-839 C &gt; T; Int8 VNTR and 3'-VNTR), and their possible role in therapeutic response to MPH treatment in a sample of 171 Brazilian adults with ADHD. The diagnostic procedures followed the DSM-IV criteria and the outcome measures were the scales Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating scale version IV and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, applied at the beginning and after the 30th day of treatment. Drug response was assessed by both categorical and dimensional approaches. There was no effect of any DAT1 polymorphisms or haplotypes on MPH response. This is the second report demonstrating absence of differences in MPH response according to DAT1 genotypes in adults with ADHD. Although <e>DAT</e> protein is crucial for the effect of MPH, genetic variations in DAT1 gene probably do not have a significant clinical role in this sample of adults with ADHD.",M2
20043136,"A PET study examining pharmacokinetics and dopamine transporter occupancy of two long-acting formulations of methylphenidate in adults.The delivery systems of two long-acting formulations of methylphenidate (MPH) were designed for different durations. Diffucaps bead-delivery system (DBDS)-MPH was designed to last 8 h and osmotically controlled-release oral delivery system (OROS)-MPH was designed to last 12 h. While the plasma pharmacokinetics and timing of efficacy have been studied, the corresponding central nervous system dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) occupancies are unknown. In this study, 21 healthy volunteers underwent PET imaging with 11C Altropane before and after administration of oral doses of DBDS-MPH and OROS-MPH. Each subject received 40 mg DBDS-MPH and 36 mg OROS-MPH on different days. PET imaging occurred at 10 h after dosing. Each subject was injected with 5 mCi of 11C Altropane and serial images of the brain were acquired over 60 min with a Siemens HR+ PET camera. Binding potentials (BP, k3/k4) were calculated from time-activity curves using the simplified reference region method with cerebellum as reference. Transporter occupancy was calculated by standard methods. At 10 h, plasma d-MPH levels were lower (3.8+/-1.2 vs. 5.2+/-2.0) and brain DAT occupancy was lower (34.8+/-12.9 vs. 44.3+/-11.8) for DBDS-MPH than OROS-MPH. Across the range of values, for each unit of change in plasma d-MPH level there was a larger change in DAT occupancy with the DBDS-MPH formulation than with the OROS-MPH formulation. As predicted from previous pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, the average plasma level and DAT occupancy of 36 mg OROS-MPH was &gt;40 mg DBDS-MPH at 10 h. Moreover, a relatively small difference in plasma levels (1.4 ng/ml at 10 h) was associated with a more impressive difference in DAT occupancy ( approximately 10% at 10 h).",M2
20035724,"Altered dopamine transporter function and phosphorylation following chronic cocaine self-administration and extinction in rats.Cocaine binds with the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>), an effect that has been extensively implicated in its reinforcing effects. However, persisting adaptations in DAT regulation after cocaine self-administration have not been extensively investigated. Here, we determined the changes in molecular mechanisms of DAT regulation in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of rats with a history of cocaine self-administration, followed by 3weeks of withdrawal under extinction conditions (i.e., no cocaine available). DA uptake was significantly higher in the CPu of cocaine-experienced animals as compared to saline-yoked controls. DAT V(max) was elevated in the CPu without changes in apparent affinity for DA. In spite of elevated CPu DAT activity, total and surface DAT density and DAT-PP2Ac (protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit) interaction remained unaltered, although p-Ser- DAT phosphorylation was elevated. In contrast to the CPu, there were no differences between cocaine and saline rats in the levels of DA uptake, DAT V(max) and K(m) values, total and surface DAT, p-Ser-DAT phosphorylation, or DAT-PP2Ac interactions in the NAcc. These results show that chronic cocaine self-administration leads to lasting, regionally specific alterations in striatal DA uptake and DAT-Ser phosphorylation. Such changes may be related to habitual patterns of cocaine-seeking observed during relapse.",M2
20029834,"Preweaning manganese exposure causes hyperactivity, disinhibition, and spatial learning and memory deficits associated with altered dopamine receptor and transporter levels.Epidemiological studies in children have reported associations between elevated dietary manganese (Mn) exposure and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits. To better understand the relationship between early Mn exposure and neurobehavioral deficits, we treated neonate rats with oral Mn doses of 0, 25, or 50 mg Mn/kg/day over postnatal day (PND) 1-21, and evaluated behavioral performance using open arena (PND 23), elevated plus maze (PND 23), and 8-arm radial maze (PND 33-46) paradigms. Brain dopamine D1 and D2-like receptors, and dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) densities were determined on PND 24, and blood and brain Mn levels were measured to coincide with behavioral testing (PND 24, PND 36). Preweaning Mn exposure caused hyperactivity and behavioral disinhibition in the open arena, but no altered behavior in the elevated plus maze. Manganese-exposed males committed significantly more reference and marginally more working errors in the radial arm maze compared to controls. Fewer Mn exposed males achieved the radial maze learning criterion, and they required more session days to reach it compared to controls. Manganese-exposed animals also exhibited a greater frequency of stereotypic response strategy in searching for the baited arms in the maze. These behavioral and learning deficits were associated with altered expression of the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and the DAT in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum. These data corroborate epidemiological studies in children, and suggest that exposure to Mn during neurodevelopment significantly alters dopaminergic synaptic environments in brain nuclei that mediate control of executive function behaviors, such as reactivity and cognitive flexibility.",M2
20029832,"Effects of the endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist, oleoylethanolamide on MDMA-induced cognitive deficits in mice.MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is an amphetamine derivative widely used for recreational purposes. We have recently shown that repeated treatment with high doses of MDMA-induced impairments in the acquisition and recall of an active avoidance task in mice. In this study, we examined whether the endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonist, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) protects against these MDMA-induced deficits. Mice were pretreated twice a day with OEA (0, 5, and 25 mg/kg) 30 min before an injection of MDMA (30 mg/kg) or saline during four consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, animals were trained in an active avoidance task for two consecutive weeks. After a 5-day resting period, a recall session was performed. Mice treated with MDMA showed reduced learning and recall of the task when compared with saline-treated controls. OEA at 5 mg/kg ameliorated and at 25 mg/kg worsened this deficit. Dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>)-binding sites significantly decreased 4 days after the last MDMA administration and pretreatment with both doses of OEA prevented this effect. In immunohistochemical studies, coexpression of tyrosine-hydroxylase and PPAR-alpha receptors was observed in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta of mice. These results suggest that OEA administration can modulate the cognitive deficits induced by MDMA in a DAT-independent manner.",M2
20026090,"In vivo type 1 cannabinoid receptor mapping in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease.Type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors are expressed in high concentrations in the central nervous system, including the basal ganglia, and could have direct or indirect effects on motor behavior through modulation of dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission. Using the CB1 receptor radioligand [(18)F]MK-9470 and small-animal PET, we investigated for the first time in vivo cerebral changes in [(18)F]MK-9470 binding in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD), parallel to dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) imaging, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining, and behavioral measurements. In the 6-OHDA model, relative [(18)F]MK-9470 PET binding decreased in the contralateral cerebellum (-9%, p&lt;0.0004) and caudate-putamen bilaterally (ipsilateral -8%, contralateral -7%; p=0.001 and p&lt;0.0003, respectively). The number of TH(+) neurons in the substantia nigra was inversely correlated to CB1 receptor binding in the ipsilateral cerebellum (p=1.10(-6)). The behavioral outcome was positively related to regional CB1 receptor binding in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (p=4.10(-6)). In vivo [(18)F]MK-9470 PET imaging points to changes in endocannabinoid transmission, specifically for CB1 receptors in the 6-OHDA model of PD, with mainly involvement of the caudate-putamen, but also distant regions of the motor circuitry, including the cerebellum and somatosensory cortex.",M2
20020109,"GBR 12909 administration as a mouse model of bipolar disorder mania: mimicking quantitative assessment of manic behavior.RATIONALE: Mania is a core feature of bipolar disorder (BD) that traditionally is assessed using rating scales. Studies using a new human behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) recently demonstrated that manic BD patients exhibit a specific profile of behavior that differs from schizophrenia and is characterized by increased motor activity, increased specific exploration, and perseverative locomotor patterns as assessed by spatial d. OBJECTIVES: It was hypothesized that disrupting dopaminergic homeostasis by inhibiting dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) function would produce a BD mania-like phenotype in mice as assessed by the mouse BPM. METHODS: We compared the spontaneous locomotor and exploratory behavior of C57BL/6J mice treated with the catecholamine transporter inhibitor amphetamine or the selective DAT inhibitor GBR 12909 in the mouse BPM. We also assessed the duration of the effect of GBR 12909 by testing mice in the BPM for 3 h and its potential strain dependency by testing 129/SvJ mice. RESULTS: Amphetamine produced hyperactivity and increased perseverative patterns of locomotion as reflected in reduced spatial d values but reduced exploratory activity in contrast to the increased exploration observed in BD patients. GBR 12909 increased activity and reduced spatial d in combination with increased exploratory behavior, irrespective of inbred strain. These effects persisted for at least 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, selectively inhibiting the DAT produced a long-lasting cross-strain behavioral profile in mice that was consistent with that observed in manic BD patients. These findings support the use of selective DAT inhibition in animal models of the impaired dopaminergic homeostasis putatively involved in the pathophysiology of BD mania.",M2
20019219,"The role of <e>DAT</e>-SPECT in movement disorders.Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is a sensitive method to detect presynaptic dopamine neuronal dysfunction, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative parkinsonism. DAT imaging can therefore assist the differentiation between conditions with and without presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. Diagnosis of Parkinson disease or tremor disorders can be achieved with high degrees of accuracy in cases with full expression of classical clinical features; however, diagnosis can be difficult, since there is a substantial clinical overlap especially in monosymptomatic tremor (dystonic tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson tremor). The use of DAT-SPECT can prove or excludes with high sensitivity nigrostriatal dysfunction in those cases and facilitates early and accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, a normal DAT-SPECT is helpful in supporting a diagnosis of drug-induced-, psychogenic- and vascular parkinsonism by excluding underlying true nigrostriatal dysfunction. This review addresses the value of DAT-SPECT and its impact on diagnostic accuracy in movement disorders presenting with tremor and/or parkinsonism.",M2
20015297,"Dopamine transporter down-regulation following repeated cocaine: implications for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced acute effects and long-term neurotoxicity in mice.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and cocaine are two widely abused psychostimulant drugs targeting the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>). DAT availability regulates dopamine neurotransmission and uptake of MDMA-derived neurotoxic metabolites. We aimed to determine the effect of cocaine pre-exposure on the acute and long-term effects of MDMA in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice received a course of cocaine (20 mg*kg(-1), x2 for 3 days) followed by MDMA (20 mg*kg(-1), x2, 3 h apart). Locomotor activity, extracellular dopamine levels and dopaminergic neurotoxicity were determined. Furthermore, following the course of cocaine, DAT density in striatal plasma membrane and endosome fractions was measured. Key results: Four days after the course of cocaine, challenge with MDMA attenuated the MDMA-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Co-administration of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor NPC 15437 prevented cocaine protection. At the same time, after the course of cocaine, DAT density was reduced in the plasma membrane and increased in the endosome fraction, and this effect was prevented by NPC 15437. The course of cocaine potentiated the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular dopamine and locomotor activity, following challenge 4 days later, compared with those pretreated with saline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Repeated cocaine treatment followed by withdrawal protected against MDMA-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity by internalizing DAT via a mechanism which may involve PKC. Furthermore, repeated cocaine followed by withdrawal induced behavioural and neurochemical sensitization to MDMA, measures which could be indicative of increased rewarding effects of MDMA.",M2
19969013,"Dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporter gene deletions differentially alter cocaine-induced taste aversion.Although cocaine is primarily known for its powerful hedonic effects, there is evidence that its affective experience has a notable aversive component that is less well understood. A variety of pharmacological and molecular approaches have implicated enhanced monoamine (MA) neurotransmission in the aversive effects of cocaine. Although numerous studies have yielded data supportive of the role of the monoamines (indirectly and directly), the specific system suggested to be involved differs across studies and paradigms (Freeman et al., 2005b; Grupp, 1997; Roberts and Fibiger, 1997). Monoamine transporter knockout mice have been useful in the study of many different aspects of cocaine effects relevant to human drug use and addiction, yet an assessment of the effects of deletion of the genes for the dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (<e>DAT</e>, NET, and SERT, respectively) on cocaine's aversive properties has yet to be performed (Uhl et al., 2002). In the current investigation, the strength of cocaine-induced aversions was compared among three groups of transgenic mice with deletions of the genes responsible for the production of one of the monoamine transporters. When compared to their respective WT controls, dopamine transporter deletion slightly attenuated cocaine-induced aversion while deletion of SERT or NET resulted in a more significant delay in the onset and strength of cocaine-induced taste aversions. The data lead us to conclude that the action of cocaine to inhibit NET contributes most substantially to its aversive effects, with some involvement of SERT and minimal contribution of DAT.",M2
19960520,"The role of the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) in the development of PTSD in preschool children.Population-based association studies have supported the heritability of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study explored the influence of genetic variation in the dopamine transporter (DAT) 3' untranslated region variable number tandem repeat on the development of PTSD in preschool children exposed to Hurricane Katrina, diagnosed using a developmentally appropriate semistructured interview. A diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition , (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), total symptoms, and specifically Criterion D symptoms were significantly more likely to be found in children with the 9 allele. This study replicates a previous finding in adults with PTSD. The specificity of this finding to the increased arousal symptoms of Criterion D suggests that dopamine and the DAT allele may contribute to one heritable path in a multifinality model of the development of PTSD.",M2
19951714,"Low and high cocaine locomotor responding male Sprague-Dawley rats differ in rapid cocaine-induced regulation of striatal dopamine transporter function.Adult outbred Sprague-Dawley rats can be classified as either low or high cocaine responders (LCRs or HCRs, respectively). Importantly, LCRs and HCRs are distinguished by their differential responsiveness to acute cocaine-induced (but not baseline) locomotor activity, inhibition of the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and resulting extracellular DA (HCR &gt; LCR), as well as by repeated cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and measures of cocaine's rewarding and reinforcing effects (LCR &gt; HCR). Curiously, 30 min after acute cocaine HCRs exhibit greater DAT-mediated [(3)H]DA uptake into striatal synaptosomes than LCRs. To investigate this finding further, we measured locomotor activity, striatal [(3)H]DA uptake kinetics and DAT cell surface expression in LCRs and HCRs over an extended period (25-180 min) after a single relatively low-dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). HCRs exhibited the  predicted  locomotor response: a marked initial activation that returned to baseline by 120 min post-injection. While LCRs exhibited a &gt;50% lower maximal locomotor response, this increase was sustained, lasting approximately 33% longer than in HCRs. At 25 min post-cocaine, maximal velocity (V(max)) of [(3)H]DA uptake was significantly higher by 25% in HCRs than LCRs, with no difference in affinity (K(m)). Despite the DAT V(max) difference, however, DAT surface expression did not differ between LCRs and HCRs. There was a similar trend (HCR &gt; LCR) for DAT V(max) at 40 min, but not at 150 or 180 min. These findings suggest that, compared to LCRs, HCRs have an enhanced ability to rapidly up-regulate DAT function in response to acute cocaine, which may contribute to their more  normal  cocaine-induced locomotor activation.",M2
19937000,"Evidence of long-term expression of behavioral sensitization to both cocaine and ethanol in dopamine transporter knockout mice.INTRODUCTION: Locomotor sensitization, defined as the progressive and enduring enhancement of the motor stimulant effects elicited by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, is the consequence of drug-induced cellular neuroadaptations that likely contribute to addictive behavior. Neuroadaptations within the dopaminergic system have been shown to be involved both in the induction phase and in the long-term expression phase of sensitization upon drug readministration after withdrawal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice lacking the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>-KO) were used to test the effect of constitutive hyperdopaminergia on the durability of behavioral sensitization to both cocaine and ethanol. The effect of the DAT mutation was simultaneously tested on two inbred genetic backgrounds, C57Bl/6 and DBA/2, chosen for their contrasting addiction-related phenotypes, as well as on the hybrid F(1) offspring of a cross between C57Bl/6 and DBA/2 congenic strains. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In spite of the absence of the DAT, mutant mice were able to develop long-term expression of sensitization to cocaine. Compared to their wild-type littermates, DAT-KO mice exhibited a markedly increased acute ethanol-evoked locomotor activity and developed stronger behavioral sensitization to ethanol during both induction and long-term expression phases. Interestingly, this increased ethanol-induced sensitization was potentiated by the DBA/2 genetic background. CONCLUSION: These findings, showing that DAT deletion facilitates sensitization, suggest a cross-sensitization-like effect between genetic- and pharmacological-induced hyperdopaminergia.",M2
19932884,"Impaired spatial working memory and decreased frontal cortex BDNF protein level in dopamine transporter knockout mice.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the key brain neurotrophins, has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and memory. Recent studies document the importance of BDNF for normal long-term memory functions. However, there are few studies of the roles of BDNF in short-term memory. Dopamine is likely to play important roles in BDNF gene expression in specific brain regions, including frontal cortical regions that are implicated in short-term working memory processes that include spontaneous alternation. We have thus tested spatial working memory in dopamine transporter knockout (<e>DAT</e> KO) and wild-type mice. Spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, an index of short-term spatial working memory in mice, was significantly decreased in DAT KO mice compared to wild-type mice. BDNF protein was significantly decreased in frontal cortex, though not in striatum or hippocampus, of the DAT KO mice. The data support the hypothesis that impaired spatial working memory in DAT KO mice may be related to decreased frontal cortical BDNF in these animals, and document apparent roles for BDNF in a short-term memory process.",M2
19928382,"The roles of dopamine transport inhibition and dopamine release facilitation in wake enhancement and rebound hypersomnolence induced by dopaminergic agents.STUDY OBJECTIVE: Rebound hypersomnolence (RHS: increased sleep following increased wake) is a limiting side-effect of many wake-promoting agents. In particular, RHS in the first few hours following wake appears to be associated with dopamine (DA)-releasing agents, e.g., amphetamine, but whether it can also be produced by DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) inhibition alone is unknown. In these studies, DA-releasing and DAT-inhibiting agents and their interaction were systematically examined for their ability to increase wake and induce RHS. DESIGN: Chronically implanted rats were evaluated in a blinded, pseudo-randomized design. PARTICIPANTS: 237 rats were used in these studies with 1 week between repeat tests. INTERVENTIONS: Animals were habituated overnight and dosed the next day, 5 h after lights on, with test agents. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep/wake activityand RHS were evaluated using EEG/EMG recording up to 22 h post dosing. In vitro dopamine release was evaluated in rat synaptosomes. At doses that produced equal increases in wake, DA-releasing (amphetamine, methamphetamine, phentermine) and several DAT-inhibiting agents (cocaine, bupropion, and methylphenidate) produced RHS during the first few hours after the onset of sleep recovery. However, other DAT-inhibiting agents (mazindol, nomifensine, GBR-12909, and GBR-12935) did not produce RHS. Combination treatment with amphetamine and nomifensine produced waking activity greater than the sum of their individual activities alone while ameliorating the amphetamine-like RHS. In rat synaptosomes, nomifensine reduced the potency of amphetamine to induce DA release approximately 270-fold, potentially explaining its action in ameliorating amphetamine-induced RHS. CONCLUSIONS: All DA releasing agents tested, and some DAT-inhibiting agents, produced RHS at equal wake-promoting doses. Thus amphetamine-like DA release appears sufficient for inducing RHS, but additional properties (pharmacologic and/or pharmacokinetic) evidently underlie RHS of other DAT inhibitors. Enhancing wake while mitigating RHS can be achieved by combining DAT-inhibiting and DA-releasing agents.",M2

19910055,"Alterations of the dopamine transporter in resting lymphocytes of patients with different psychotic disorders.The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the dopamine (DA) transporter (<e>DAT</e>) in resting lymphocytes of 20 psychotic patients and 20 healthy control subjects, by means of both the binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) of 3H-WIN 35,428, and the reuptake parameters (Vmax and Km) of 3H-DA. The results showed that both the Bmax of 3H-WIN 35,428 binding and the Vmax of 3H-DA reuptake of the patients were significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, while the Kd or Km did not show any change. These findings, while indicating a reduced density of the lymphocyte DAT proteins, provide further support of the role of DA in psychoses and suggest that DA alterations may not be limited to brain structures.",M2
19906957,"Hyperdopaminergic tone erodes prefrontal long-term potential via a D2 receptor-operated protein phosphatase gate.Dopamine (DA) plays crucial roles in the cognitive functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which, to a large degree, depends on lasting neural traces formed in prefrontal networks. The establishment of these permanent traces requires changes in cortical synaptic efficacy. DA, via the D(1)-class receptors, is thought to gate or facilitate synaptic plasticity in the PFC, with little role recognized for the D(2)-class receptors. Here we show that, when significantly elevated, DA erodes, rather than facilitates, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC by acting at the far less abundant cortical D(2)-class receptors through a dominant coupling to the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity in postsynaptic neurons. In mice with persistently elevated extracellular DA, resulting from inactivation of the DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) gene, LTP in layer V PFC pyramidal neurons cannot be established, regardless of induction protocols. Acute increase of dopaminergic transmission by DAT blockers or overstimulation of D(2) receptors in normal mice have similar LTP shutoff effects. LTP in mutant mice can be rescued by a single in vivo administration of D(2)-class antagonists. Suppression of postsynaptic PP1 mimics and occludes the D(2)-mediated rescue of LTP in mutant mice and prevents the acute erosion of LTP by D(2) agonists in normal mice. Our studies reveal a mechanistically unique heterosynaptic PP1 gate that is constitutively driven by background DA to influence LTP induction. By blocking prefrontal synaptic plasticity, excessive DA may prevent storage of lasting memory traces in PFC networks and impair executive functions.",M2
19899168,"Molecular dynamics of leucine and dopamine transporter proteins in a model cell membrane lipid bilayer.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) operates via facilitated diffusion, harnessing an inward Na(+) gradient to drive dopamine from the extracellular synaptic cleft to the neuron interior. The DAT is relevant to central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson disease and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and is the primary site of action for the abused psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamines. Crystallization of a DAT homolog, the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT, provided the first reliable 3-D DAT template. Here, the LeuT crystal structure and the DAT molecular model have been combined with their respective substrates, leucine and dopamine, in lipid bilayer molecular dynamics simulations toward tracking substrate movement along the protein's substrate/ion permeation pathway. Specifically, movement of residue pairs that comprise the  external gate  was followed as a function of substrate presence. The transmembrane (TM) 1 arginine-TM 10 aspartate strut formed less readily in DAT compared with LeuT, with or without substrate present. For LeuT but not DAT, the addition of substrate enhanced the chances of forming the TM 1-10 bridge. Also, movement of the fourth extracellular loop EL-4 in the presence of substrate was more pronounced for DAT, the EL-4 unwinding to a degree. The overall similarity between the LeuT and DAT molecular dynamics simulations indicated that LeuT was a legitimate model to guide DAT structure-function predictions. There were, nevertheless, differences significant enough to allow for DAT-unique insights, which may include how cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, NIDA Drug Supply, Rockville, MD), and other DAT blockers are not recognized as substrates even though they can access the primary substrate binding pocket.

19855096,"Lobelane inhibits methamphetamine-evoked dopamine release via inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter-2.Lobeline is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a methamphetamine abuse treatment. Lobeline interacts with nicotinic receptor subtypes, dopamine transporters (<e>DATs</e>), and vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT2s). Methamphetamine inhibits VMAT2 and promotes dopamine (DA) release from synaptic vesicles, resulting ultimately in increased extracellular DA. The present study generated structure-activity relationships by defunctionalizing the lobeline molecule and determining effects on [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding, inhibition of [(3)H]DA uptake into striatal synaptic vesicles and synaptosomes, the mechanism of VMAT2 inhibition, and inhibition of methamphetamine-evoked DA release. Compared with lobeline, the analogs exhibited greater potency inhibiting DA transporter (DAT) function. Saturated analogs, lobelane and nor-lobelane, exhibited high potency (K(i) = 45 nM) inhibiting vesicular [(3)H]DA uptake, and lobelane competitively inhibited VMAT2 function. Lobeline and lobelane exhibited 67- and 35-fold greater potency, respectively, in inhibiting VMAT2 function compared to DAT function. Lobelane potently decreased (IC(50) = 0.65 microM; I(max) = 73%) methamphetamine-evoked DA overflow, and with a greater maximal effect compared with lobeline (IC(50) = 0.42 microM, I(max) = 56.1%). These results provide support for VMAT2 as a target for inhibition of methamphetamine effects. Both trans-isomers and demethylated analogs of lobelane had reduced or unaltered potency inhibiting VMAT2 function and lower maximal inhibition of methamphetamine-evoked DA release compared with lobelane. Thus, defunctionalization, cis-stereochemistry of the side chains, and presence of the piperidino N-methyl are structural features that afford greatest inhibition of methamphetamine-evoked DA release and enhancement of selectivity for VMAT2. The current results reveal that lobelane, a selective VMAT2 inhibitor, inhibits methamphetamine-evoked DA release and is a promising lead for the development of a pharmacotherapeutic for methamphetamine abuse.",M2
19852071,"Dopamine transporter PET in normal aging: dopamine transporter decline and its possible role in preservation of motor function.OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of age-related decline in dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) expression on motor function in the elderly. METHODS: About 33 normal individuals of a wide age range were scanned with PET employing d-threo-[(11)C]-methylphenidate (MP, a marker of DAT) and [(11)C]-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ, that binds to the vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2). Motor function was assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPB). We analyzed the relationship between [(11)C]-MP and motor performance. RESULTS: Age ranged from 27- to 77-year old (mean +/- SD, 54.75 +/- 14.14). There was no age-related decline in binding potentials (BP) for [(11)C]-DTBZ. In contrast, [(11)C]-MP BP was inversely related to age in all striatal regions analyzed (caudate: reduction of 11.2% per decade, P &lt; 0.0001, r = -0.86; putamen: reduction of 10.5% per decade, P &lt; 0.0001, r = -0.80). A differential effect of [(11)C]-MP on PPB could be observed according to age group. There was a positive relation between the PPB and [(11)C]-MP in young individuals (coefficient = 13.56), whereas in individuals greater than 57 years this relationship was negative (coefficient = -19.53, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm prior observations of age-related DAT decline and suggest that this phenomenon is independent of changes in VMAT2. After the fifth decade of life, this reduction in DAT binding is associated with a motor performance comparable to mid-adult life. These findings imply that biochemical processes associated with healthy aging may offset the naturaldecline in motor function observed in the elderly.",M2
19842636,"Detection of endogenous dopamine changes in Drosophila melanogaster using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry.Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is a commonly used model organism because of its homology to mammals and facile genetic manipulations. However, the size of the nervous system is very small. We report a method to evoke and detect rapid changes in extracellular dopamine in a single nerve cord isolated from a Drosophila larva. Flies were genetically modified to express Channelrhodopsin-2, a blue-light activated cation channel, in only dopaminergic neurons. Extracellular dopamine changes were measured with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at an implanted carbon-fiber microelectrode. Stimulations of 7 s with blue light result in an average peak dopamine concentration of 810 +/- 60 nM, similar to electrically-stimulated release in mammals. Stimulations repeated at 15 min intervals are stable for 65 min, allowing pharmacological experiments in the same sample. Peak duration is extended after cocaine or nisoxetine, inhibitors of the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>). Release was reduced upon exposure to reserpine, which inhibits vesicular packaging. Chronic administration of NSD-1015, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor, decreased dopamine release and inhibited pupation, showing a link between neurotransmission and physiology. This is the first method to measure endogenous dopamine in an intact larval Drosophila nervous system and will allow studies of genetic and pharmacological manipulations of dopamine release and uptake.",M2

Here, we examine the effect of ISL on methamphetamine-induced striatal neurotoxicity. Repeated injections of methamphetamine cause the loss of striatal dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Intraperitoneal injection of ISL prior to methamphetamine injection significantly prevented methamphetamine-induced reduction of DAT and TH. ISL also suppressed methamphetamine-induced activation of glial cells. Moreover, ISL impeded the expression of nitric oxide synthase and the activation of NF-kappaB through blockage of its phosphorylation. Our results suggest that ISL protects against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.",M2
19831380,"Mechanism for cocaine blocking the transport of dopamine: insights from molecular modeling and dynamics simulations.Molecular modeling and dynamics simulations have been performed to study how cocaine inhibits dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) for the transport of dopamine. The computationally determined DAT-ligand binding mode is totally different from the previously proposed overlap binding mode in which cocaine- and dopamine-binding sites are the same (Beuming, T.; et al. Nat. Neurosci. 2008, 11, 780-789). The new cocaine-binding site does not overlap with, but is close to, the dopamine-binding site. Analysis of all results reveals that when cocaine binds to DAT, the initial binding site is likely the one modeled in this study because this binding site can naturally accommodate cocaine. Then cocaine may move to the dopamine-binding site after DAT makes some necessary conformational change and expands the binding site cavity. It has been demonstrated that cocaine may inhibit the transport of dopamine through both blocking the initial DAT-dopamine binding and reducing the kinetic turnover of the transporter following the DAT-dopamine binding. The relative contributions to the phenomenological inhibition of the transport of dopamine from blocking the initial binding and reducing the kinetic turnover can be different in different types of assays. The obtained general structural and mechanistic insights are consistent with available experimental data and could be valuable for guiding future studies toward understanding cocaine's inhibiting of other transporters.",M2
19830701,"Attenuation of estradiol on the reduction of striatal dopamine by amphetamine in ovariectomized rats.Amphetamine (AMPH) is a highly addictive drug of abuse which exhibits toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in long-term abusers. Estrogen seems to show neuroprotection in dopamine (DA) deficit caused by AMPH. The present study was to investigate the effects of estradiol on the levels of striatal DA in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats treated with or without AMPH. Female rats were Ovx for 2 weeks before administration of AMPH (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) with or without 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB) (25 microg/kg/day, s.c.) for 7 days. The striatal tissues were collected, homogenized with DA mobile phase, and centrifuged. The concentrations of DA in the supernatants were detected by HPLC. The protein expressions of dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were analyzed by Western blotting. The results indicated that AMPH could attenuate DA level significantly in striatum (P &lt; 0.01). Comparing to control groups, administration of either EB or EB plus AMPH increased DA level (P &lt; 0.01). The protein expression of striatal DAT was significant greater (P &lt; 0.01) in rats treated with AMPH plus EB than AMPH treated animals. These results suggest that the DA levels in striatum can be enhanced by EB via an increase of DAT expression following administration of AMPH.",M2
19796878,"Associations between polymorphisms in dopamine neurotransmitter pathway genes and pain response in healthy humans.Although evidence shows that several dopamine neurotransmission pathway genes are associated with specific clinical pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, chronic headache, and postoperative pain, the exact role of dopamine in pain processing is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between functional polymorphisms in dopaminergic candidate genes and sensitivity to pain in healthy subjects. Healthy subjects (n=192; 105 F, 87 M) were exposed to experimental tonic cold pain (1 degrees C) and phasic heat pain (47 degrees C) stimuli. DNA samples were obtained from both participants and their parents. The relationships between pain response (intensity in response to heat and cold; threshold and tolerance in response to cold only) and the functional Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms of three dopamine-related genes were investigated using a Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT). Specifically, 30-bp repeat in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidase-A gene (MAO-A), 40-bp repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the dopamine transporter gene (<e>DAT</e>-1), and 48-bp repeat in the exon 3 of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4) were examined. Significant associations between cold pain tolerance and DAT-1 (p=0.008) and MAO-A (p=0.024) polymorphisms were found. Specifically, tolerance was shorter for carriers of allele 10 and the rarer allele 11, as compared to homozygous for allele 9, and for carriers of allele 4 as compared to homozygous for allele 3, respectively. These results, together with the known function of the investigated candidate gene polymorphisms, suggest that low dopaminergic activity can be associated with high pain sensitivity and vice versa.",M2
19795467,"Combined use of <e>DAT</e>-SPECT and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy in mixed tremors.The cooccurrence of rest and postural tremor (mixed tremor) as the predominant clinical manifestation in patients who do not fulfill diagnostic established criteria for essential tremor (ET) or Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a clinical diagnostic challenge. Twenty-two patients with mixed tremor and additional mild extrapyramidal features, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, 20 patients with probable PD, 10 patients with probable ET, and 18 controls were investigated through the combined use of dopamine transporter (123)I-FP-CIT-single-photon emission tomography (DAT-SPECT) and cardiac (123)metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) scintigraphy. Six of the 22 mixed-tremor patients had normal DAT-SPECT, a condition usually found in patients with ET, whereas 16 patients showed damage to the nigrostriatal system. Cardiac MIBG allowed further differentiation between these 16 patients because eight of them had decreased tracer uptakes (heart/mediastinum [H/M] ratio in delayed image, H/M ratio delayed: 1.16 +/- 0.11, P &lt; 0.001 vs controls), indicating a PD, whereas the remaining eight had normal cardiac tracer uptakes, a finding suggestive of a parkinsonian syndrome (H/M ratio delayed: 1.90 +/- 0.13). Both DAT-SPECT and cardiac MIBG scintigraphies were abnormal in the 20 patients with probable PD, whereas these were normal in both the patients with probable ET as well as in the controls. Our study suggests that the combined use of both DAT-SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy in mixed tremors with additional extrapyramidal features can help distinguish patients with ET from those with PD and parkinsonism.",M2
19789969,"Basal ganglia neuroprotection with anticonvulsants after energy stress: a comparative study.The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model provides a valuable paradigm of the energy deficiency disorders found in childhood. In such disorders, anticonvulsants may provide neuroprotection by modulating cellular energy consumption and by exerting favorable pleiotropic effects on neuronal survival. To verify such hypothesis, we tested the effects of levetiracetam, vigabatrin, gabapentine, pregabaline, tiagabine, clonazepam and lamotrigine on neuroprotection in the MPTP mouse model. The membrane dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) density, which provides a reliable index of dopaminergic neurons survival in the basal ganglia, was assessed by semi-quantitative autoradiography of the striatum.

19766189,"Dopamine transporter glycosylation correlates with the vulnerability of midbrain dopaminergic cells in Parkinson's disease.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) is a membrane glycoprotein responsible for dopamine (DA) uptake, which has been involved in the degeneration of DA cells in Parkinson's disease (PD). Given that DAT activity depends on its glycosylation status and membrane expression, and that not all midbrain DA cells show the same susceptibility to degeneration in PD, we have investigated a possible relationship between DAT glycosylation and function and the differential vulnerability of DA cells. Glycosylated DAT expression, DA uptake, and DAT V(max) were significantly higher in terminals of nigrostriatal neurons than in those of mesolimbic neurons. No differences were found in non-glycosylated DAT expression and DAT K(m), and DA uptake differences disappeared after deglycosylation of nigrostriatal synaptosomes. The expression pattern of glycosylated DAT in the human midbrain and striatum showed a close anatomical relationship with DA degeneration in parkinsonian patients. This relationship was confirmed in rodent and monkey models of PD, and in HEK cells expressing the wild-type and a partially deglycosylated DAT form. These results strongly suggest that DAT glycosylation is involved in the differential vulnerability of midbrain DA cells in PD.",M2
19759529,"The glycine transporter-1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice.Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and <e>DAT</e>(-/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.",M2
19755139,"Cis-acting elements responsible for dopaminergic neuron-specific expression of zebrafish slc6a3 (dopamine transporter) in vivo are located remote from the transcriptional start site.The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the zebrafish solute carrier family 6 member 3 gene (slc6a3, dopamine transporter, <e>dat</e>), as a first step towards isolating regulatory sequences useful for driving transgene expression within dopaminergic neurons of the zebrafish CNS in vivo. We found that the 3.0 kb slc6a3 mRNA is expressed in each of the major groups of dopaminergic neurons previously identified in the zebrafish CNS. The slc6a3 gene spans &gt;20 kb of genomic DNA and contains 15 exons. The genomic organization of slc6a3 is highly conserved with respect to its human orthologue, including the presence of an untranslated first exon. The promoter lacks a canonical TATA box and there are multiple transcriptional start sites. Functional analysis of cis-acting elements responsible for the expression pattern of slc6a3 was carried out by generating stable transgenic zebrafish lines expressing fluorescent reporters under transcriptional control of fragments of slc6a3 genomic sequence. The region between -2 kb and +5 kb with respect to the transcriptional start site contains the core slc6a3 promoter, in addition to neuronal enhancers and/or non-neuronal repressors that restrict expression to the CNS, but this region lacks cis-acting elements responsible for slc6a3 expression in dopaminergic neurons. The upstream sequence between -6 kb and -2 kb contains an enhancer element that drives slc6a3 expression in dopaminergic neurons of the pretectal region, and additional sequences that partially repress expression in non-dopaminergic neurons. However, expression of slc6a3 in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral diencephalon and telencephalon is dependent on elements that lie outside the region -6 kb to +5 kb. These data provide a detailed analysis of the slc6a3 gene and show that its expression in different populations of dopamine neurons is driven by discrete enhancers, rather than a single target sequence for a terminal factor involved in specifying neurochemical phenotype.",M2
19750538,"Embryonic stem cells with GFP knocked into the dopamine transporter yield purified dopamine neurons in vitro and from knock-in mice.Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of midbrain dopamine neurons.

Scarcity of tissue has limited clinical application to a small number of research subjects worldwide. Selective differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to dopamine neurons could lead to an unlimited supply of cells for expanded clinical transplantation. To facilitate the differentiation and purification of dopamine neurons, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) locus in mouse ESCs using homologous recombination. From these DAT-GFP ESCs, dopamine neurons expressing GFP were successfully produced by in vitro differentiation. The DAT-GFP ESCs were used to generate DAT-GFP knock-in mice. We have found that GFP was colocalized with DAT, Pitx3, Engrailed-1, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in midbrain, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb but not in noradrenergic cell regions or other ectopic sites. The GFP-positive dopamine neurons could be isolated from embryonic day-15 ventral midbrain by fluorescence activated cell sorting. These purified dopamine neurons survived reculture and expressed tyrosine hydroxylase and DAT when cocultured with mouse astrocytes or striatal cells. Animals homozygous for DAT-GFP were hyperactive because they had no functional DAT protein. These DAT-GFP knock-in ESCs and mice provide unique tools for purifying dopamine neurons to study their physiology, pharmacology, and genetic profiles.",M2
19748494,"Mithramycin protects against dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the mouse brain after administration of methamphetamine.The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of mithramycin, an inhibitor of transcription factor Specificity protein (Sp)-1, on the behavioral changes and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum after administration of methamphetamine (METH). Pretreatment with mithramycin (75, 150 or 300 microg/kg) did not alter acute hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of METH (3 mg/kg). However, the development of behavioral sensitization in mice after repeated administration of METH (3 mg/kg/day, once daily for 5 days) was significantly blocked by pretreatment with mithramycin (300 microg/kg). Furthermore, pretreatment with mithramycin (300 microg/kg) significantly attenuated the hyperthermia in mice after repeated administration of METH (3 mg/kgx3, 3-h intervals). Moreover, the combination of pretreatment and subsequent administration of mithramycin (75, 150 or 300 microg/kg) significantly attenuated the reductions of dopamine (DA), its major metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3 mg/kgx3, 3-h intervals), and these attenuations were dose dependent. These findings suggest that mithramycin attenuates the development of behavioral sensitization and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after repeated administration of METH. Therefore, mithramycin could have potential for the treatment of METH abusers, particularly since this drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. In the future, however, another Sp1 inhibitors with fewer side effects might be more appropriate.",M2
19740630,"Signs of striatal dopamine transporter density increase in association with improvement of tardive dyskinesia in a patient with schizophrenia, as demonstrated by a <e>DAT</e> scan.The imaging of the dopamine transporter could demonstrate the implication of dopaminergic pathway in the appearance of tardive dyskinesia. We report a case with psychotic and tardive dyskinesia symptoms. A DAT scan showed decreased dopamine transporter uptake in the area of brain's basal gaglia. A trial with quetiapine improved both psychotic and TD symptoms while a second DAT scan showed improvement status. We conclude that increased dopamine transporter uptake seemed to associate with the improvement of TD.",M2
19738093,"Evaluating dopamine reward pathway in ADHD: clinical implications.CONTEXT: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--characterized by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity--is the most prevalent childhood psychiatric disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, and there is increasing evidence of reward-motivation deficits in this disorder. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate biological bases that might underlie a reward/motivation deficit by imaging key components of the brain dopamine reward pathway (mesoaccumbens). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used positron emission tomography to measure dopamine synaptic markers (transporters and D(2)/D(3) receptors) in 53 nonmedicated adults with ADHD and 44 healthy controls between 2001-2009 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured specific binding of positron emission tomographic radioligands for dopamine transporters (<e>DAT</e>) using [(11)C]cocaine and for D(2)/D(3) receptors using [(11)C]raclopride, quantified as binding potential (distribution volume ratio -1). RESULTS: For both ligands, statistical parametric mapping showed that specific binding was lower in ADHD than in controls (threshold for significance set at P &lt; .005) in regions of the dopamine reward pathway in the left side of the brain. Region-of-interest analyses corroborated these findings. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI] of mean difference) for DAT in the nucleus accumbens for controls was 0.71 vs 0.63 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.03-0.13, P = .004) and in the midbrain for controls was 0.16 vs 0.09 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.03-0.12; P &lt; or = .001); for D(2)/D(3) receptors, the mean accumbens for controls was 2.85 vs 2.68 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.06-0.30, P = .004); and in the midbrain, it was for controls 0.28 vs 0.18 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.02-0.17, P = .01). The analysis also corroborated differences in the left caudate: the mean DAT for controls was 0.66 vs 0.53 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.04-0.22; P = .003) and the mean D(2)/D(3) for controls was 2.80 vs 2.47 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.10-0.56; P = .005) and differences in D(2)/D(3) in the hypothalamic region, with controls having a mean of 0.12 vs 0.05 for those with ADHD (95% CI, 0.02-0.12; P = .004). Ratings of attention correlated with D(2)/D(3) in the accumbens (r = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.52; P = .001), midbrain (r = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52; P = .001), caudate (r = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.50; P = .003), and hypothalamic (r = 0.31; CI, 0.10-0.49; P = .003) regions and with DAT in the midbrain (r = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.53; P &lt; or = .001). CONCLUSION: A reduction in dopamine synaptic markers associated with symptoms of inattention was shown in the dopamine reward pathway of participants with ADHD.",M2
19729579,"Low or high cocaine responding rats differ in striatal extracellular dopamine levels and dopamine transporter number.Both humans and animals exhibit marked individual differences in cocaine responsiveness. By using the median split of cocaine-induced locomotor activity, we have classified outbred male Sprague-Dawley rats as either low or high cocaine responders (LCRs or HCRs, respectively). LCR/HCR classification predicts differences in cocaine inhibition of striatal dopamine (DA) transporters (<e>DATs</e>), cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, cocaine-conditioned place preference, and motivation to self-administer cocaine. In this study, we used in vivo microdialysis to investigate whether the differential cocaine inhibition of DATs in LCRs and HCRs is translated into differential extracellular DA levels. Paralleling their locomotor profiles, LCRs and HCRS had similar basal extracellular DA levels in dorsal striatum (dSTR) and nucleus accumbens (NAc); after acute cocaine injection (10 mg/kg i.p.), HCRs showed greater cocaine-induced increases in DA than LCRs, with more pronounced differences in NAc. After repeated cocaine injection, LCRs and HCRs no longer differed in cocaine-induced locomotor activity or extracellular DA. To further explore the differential susceptibility of LCR/HCR DATs to cocaine, we used in vitro [(3)H]2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane ([(3)H]WIN 35,428) binding and quantitative autoradiography to measure the number of DAT binding sites and cocaine's affinity for them. After acute cocaine administration, HCRs had fewer DAT binding sites in dSTR and NAc shell, compared to LCRs. No LCR/HCR differences were observed in DAT number after repeated cocaine injection or in cocaine's affinity. Our findings suggest that levels of striatal extracellular DA and DATs both make important contributions to initial differences in cocaine activation, which in LCRs/HCRs predict differential cocaine reward and reinforcement.",M2
19705471,"Severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and dopamine transporter levels in dementia with Lewy bodies: a 123I-FP-CIT SPECT study.Neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) imaging with (123)I-labeled ligand N-delta-(fluoropropyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropene ((123)I-FP-CIT), which reliably measures midbrain dopaminergic dysfunction, has provided important evidence on the neurobiological substrate of some of these symptoms including apathy and depression. However, little is known on DAT levels and other distressing symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, (123)I-FP-CIT imaging was performed in 18 well-characterized patients with DLB, and striatal DAT levels were correlated with the frequency/severity ratings of several neuropsychiatric symptoms. A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms could be observed in the sample. Significant correlations were observed between decreased striatal DAT levels and visual hallucinations. Although there were no correlations between striatal DAT levels and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, when considering the putamen and the caudate nucleus separately, delusions, depression, and apathy were inversely correlated to decreased caudate DAT levels. The seresults provide intriguing evidence on the involvement of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathways in neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB.",M2
19686731,"Effects of a novel dopamine uptake inhibitor upon extracellular dopamine from superfused murine striatal tissue.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) plays an important role in substance abuse, schizophrenia, and dopaminergic toxicity associated with the Parkinsonian animal model toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Accordingly, the DAT serves as a critical component in regulating dopaminergic function in health and disease states. We have been working with a novel cage compound, 8-phenylethyl-pentacycloundecane , and found that this compound can inhibit dopamine uptake and serve as a neuroprotectant against MPTP-induced dopaminergic toxicity. The current study was aimed at investigating additional mechanistic features of DAT function that interact with our compound (1). Extracellular dopamine levels were analyzed from superfused striatal tissue in response to various conditions of compound 1 infusion. The results showed that compound 1: (1) significantly increased spontaneous dopamine; (2) significantly decreased methamphetamine-stimulated dopamine; (3) significantly increased dopamine when co-infused with 30 mM potassium chloride; (4) lost the stimulatory effect of potassium chloride-evoked dopamine when calcium-free buffer was used and (5) exhibited moderate voltage-gated calcium channel blocking activity with an IC(50) of 22 microM. These data demonstrate that compound 1 modulates dopaminergic function as determined by effects upon extracellular dopamine responses. It appears that compound 1 exerts these effects primarily through interaction with the DAT by blocking dopamine uptake via a calcium-dependent mechanism, and does not lead to extracellular efflux via the DAT. In conclusion, the findings suggest that compound 1 may have the potential to serve as a lead candidate for therapeutics designed to treat drug abuse and possibly disorders like Parkinson's disease.",M2
19670315,"Computational analysis of determinants of dopamine (DA) dysfunction in DA nerve terminals.Dopamine signaling is involved in a number of brain pathways, and its disruption has been suggested to be involved in the several disease states, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been hypothesized that altered storage, release, and reuptake of dopamine contributes to both the hypo- and hyperdopaminergic states that exist in various diseases. Here, we use our recently described mathematical model of dopamine metabolism, combined with a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation analysis, to identify key determinants of dopamine metabolism associated with the dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis that may contribute to the pathogenesis of dopamine-based disorders. Our model reveals that the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>), the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), and the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) are the most influential components controlling the synaptic level of dopamine and the formation of toxic intracellular metabolites. The results are consistent with experimental observations and point to metabolic processes and combinations of processes that may be biochemical drivers of dopamine neuron degeneration. Since many of the identified components can be targeted therapeutically, the model may aid in the design of combined therapeutic regimens aimed at restoring proper dopamine signaling with toxic intermediates under control.",M2
19666577,"Epistasis between the <e>DAT</e> 3' UTR VNTR and the COMT Val158Met SNP on cortical function in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia.Dopamine has a crucial role in the modulation of neurocognitive function, and synaptic dopamine activity is normally regulated by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Perturbed dopamine function is a key pathophysiological feature of schizophrenia. Our objectives were (i) to examine epistasis between the DAT 3' UTR variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms on brain activation during executive function, and (ii) to then determine the extent to which such interaction is altered in schizophrenia. Regional brain response was measured by using blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI during an overt verbal fluency task in 85 subjects (44 healthy volunteers and 41 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia), and inferences were estimated by using an ANOVA in SPM5. There was a significant COMT x DAT nonadditive interaction effect on activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, irrespective of diagnostic group (Z-score = 4.3; family-wise error (FWE) p = 0.03), and in healthy volunteers alone (Z-score = 4.7; FWEp = 0.006). In this region, relatively increased activation was detected only when COMT Met-158/Met-158 subjects also carried the 9-repeat DAT allele, or when, reversely, Val-158/Val-158 subjects carried the 10/10-repeat genotype. Also, there was a significant diagnosis x COMT x DAT nonadditive interaction in the right orbital gyrus (Z-score = 4.3; FWEp = 0.04), where, only within patients, greater activation was only associated with a 9-repeat allele and Val-158 conjunction, and with a 10-repeat and Met-158 conjunction (Z-score = 4.3; FWE p = 0.04). These data demonstrate that COMT and DAT genes interact nonadditively to modulate cortical function during executive processing, and also, that this effect is significantly altered in schizophrenia, which may reflect abnormal dopamine function in the disorder.",M2
19664686,"Potential association of DRD2 and DAT1 genetic variation with heroin dependence.The aim of our study was to investigate the potential association of dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) TaqI RFLP A (rs1800497) and dopamine transporter gene (<e>DAT</e>) 3'untranslated region VNTR genetic variations with heroin addiction. Genotyping was performed using PCR-based techniques in 530 heroin abusers and 500 controls. Our results showed that DRD2 TaqI A1 allele carriers (genotypes A1A1 and A1A2) were prone to heroin abuse in models of dominance or co-dominance. We detected a 12 repeat allele and 6/6, 7/9, 9/11, 10/12 genotype in a Chinese/eastern Asian population for the first time. However, no significant differences in the DAT1 VNTR were found between the two groups in either genotypic or allelic distributions and there was no gene interaction between the two genetic loci.",M2
19648469,"Extended methamphetamine self-administration in rats results in a selective reduction of dopamine transporter levels in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum not accompanied by marked monoaminergic depletion.Chronic abuse of methamphetamine leads to cognitive dysfunction and high rates of relapse, paralleled by significant changes of brain dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission. Previously, we found that rats with extended access to methamphetamine self-administration displayed enhanced methamphetamine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking and cognitive deficits relative to limited access animals. The present study investigated whether extended access to methamphetamine self-administration produced abnormalities in dopamine and serotonin systems in rat forebrain. Rats self-administered methamphetamine (0.02-mg/i.v. infusion) during daily 1-h sessions for 7 to 10 days, followed by either short- (1-h) or long-access (6-h) self-administration for 12 to 14 days. Lever responding was extinguished for 2 weeks before either reinstatement testing or rapid decapitation and tissue dissection. Tissue levels of monoamine transporters and markers of methamphetamine-induced toxicity were analyzed in several forebrain areas. Long-access methamphetamine self-administration resulted in escalation of daily drug intake ( approximately 7 mg/kg/day) and enhanced drug-primed reinstatement compared with the short-access group. Furthermore, long-, but not short-access to self-administered methamphetamine resulted in persistent decreases in dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) protein levels in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. In contrast, only minor alterations in the tissue levels of dopamine or its metabolites were found, and no changes in markers specific for dopamine terminals or glial cell activation were detected. Our findings suggest that persistent methamphetamine seeking is associated with region-selective changes in DAT levels without accompanying monoaminergic neurotoxicity. Greater understanding of the neuroadaptations underlying persistent methamphetamine seeking and cognitive deficits could yield targets suitable for future therapeutic interventions.",M2
19632235,"Resilience and vulnerability are dose-dependently related to neonatal stressors in mice.Early life experiences have been shown to adjust cognitive abilities, stress reactivity, fear responses and immune activity in adult mammals of many species. However, whereas severe stressors have been generally associated with the emergence of hypothalamic pituitary adreno-cortical (HPA)-mediated pathology, mild neonatal stressful experiences have been traditionally associated with 'positive' effects or resilience. External stressors stimulate the HPA axis to induce a corticosterone secretion in mouse dams, which, in turn is directly transmitted to the progeny through lactation. Such corticosteroid transfer may offer a unitary mechanism whereby early low corticosterone exposure may favor resilience in the offspring and high corticosterone increase vulnerability to pathology. In this study we further investigated this hypothesis by evaluating the long-term effects of a neonatal exposure to low (33 mg/l) and high (100 mg/l) doses of corticosterone during the first 10 days of life in outbred CD-1 mice through supplementation in the maternal drinking water. Offspring attentional set-shifting abilities, central neurotrophic regulation and levels of natural auto-antibodies (na-Abs) directed to serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (<e>DAT</e>) transporters were assessed in adulthood. While low levels of neonatal corticosterone improved adult cognitive abilities and increased na-Abs levels directed to SERT, high doses of neonatal corticosterone reduced hippocampal BDNF levels and na-Abs directed to DAT. These findings confirm and extend our previous findings, supporting the view that both adaptive plasticity and pathological outcomes in adulthood may depend on circulating neonatal corticosterone levels and that these effects follow a U-shaped profile.",M2
19631714,"Gender differences on MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) neurotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice.The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gender difference in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we investigated the time-dependent alterations of dopamine and its metabolites, striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein, dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) protein and midbrain TH protein and motor function in male and female mice 5h and 1, 3 and 7 days after four administrations of MPTP (20mg/kg) at 2-h intervals. The present study showed that the decrease of dopamine, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and HVA (homovanillic acid) content in female mice was more pronounced than that in male animals 1, 3 and 7 days after MPTP treatment. Our Western blot analysis study also demonstrated that the decrease of both striatal and midbrain TH protein levels in female mice was more pronounced than that in male animals from 1 to 7 days after MPTP treatment. As compared to male mice, in contrast, the increase of striatal GFAP protein levels in female mice was observed from 5h to 7 days after MPTP treatment. Furthermore, the present study showed that motor deficits were found in both male and female mice 1 and 7 days after MPTP treatment. In the present study, moreover, the decrease of striatal DAT protein levels in female mice was more pronounced than that in male animals 1, 3 and 7 days after MPTP treatment. These results demonstrate that our administrations of MPTP at 2-h intervals can cause more severe damage in female mice as compared with male animals. The gender difference may be due to the decrease of DAT expression caused by MPTP. Thus our findings provide further valuable information for the pathogenesis of PD.",M2
19631257,"Rab 11 regulates constitutive dopamine transporter trafficking and function in N2A neuroblastoma cells.The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) is a crucial regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission which undergoes constitutive and substrate-mediated trafficking to and from the membrane. Although, considerable research has been done to elucidate the regulation of substrate-stimulated DAT trafficking, less is known about which trafficking proteins are involved in constitutive DAT trafficking. Rab proteins are GTPases known to regulate the trafficking of proteins to and from specific endocytic compartments. Rabs 8 and 11, in particular, are involved in trafficking proteins from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. In this study, we sought to determine whether Rabs 8 and 11 would modulate DAT activity and trafficking in N2A neuroblastoma cells. We used Rab mutations known to confer constitutively active or dominant negative activity of these proteins to investigate the role of Rab activity in constitutive DAT trafficking and function. We found that constitutively active Rab 11 upregulates DAT function and surface expression while neither the constitutively active nor the dominant negative mutant of Rab 8 had any effect on DA uptake. Furthermore, immunofluorescence experiments revealed that dominant negative Rab 11 overexpression results in decreased surface DAT indicating a necessary function of Rab 11 in DAT trafficking to the plasma membrane. These data show for the first time a functional role of Rab proteins in the constitutive recycling of DAT to the plasma membrane.",M2
19628755,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 inhibitors: inhibition of dopamine transporter activity.Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5 reduces the rewarding properties of psychostimulants by dampening postsynaptic dopamine (DA) receptor signaling. Cdk5 is also present in midbrain DA neurons, where the DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) is localized and limits DA neurotransmission by removing extracellular DA. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Cdk5 could also affect the disposition of DA by regulating DAT activity. Incubation of rat dorsal striatal (dSTR) synaptosomes with the Cdk5 inhibitors roscovitine, olomoucine, and 4-{[(7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-e]indol-8-ylidene)methyl]amino}-N-(2-pyridyl)benzenesulfonamide (GW8510) or the inactive congener iso-olomoucine resulted in a rapid, concentration-dependent inhibition of specific [3H]DA uptake. However, roscovitine was the only inhibitor that did not also decrease [3H]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (WIN35,428) binding to dSTR DATs. Roscovitine-induced inhibition of dSTR [3H]DA uptake was explained by decreased maximal uptake velocity, without a change in cell-surface DAT levels. Roscovitine did not enhance [3H]DA release mediated by either DAT reverse-transport or Ca(2+) channels in dSTR slices. Instead, roscovitine enhanced spontaneous [3H]DA outflow and inhibited DAT-mediated [3H]DA reaccumulation into dSTR slices. To explore the involvement of Cdk5 in roscovitine-induced down-regulation of DAT activity, Cdk5 protein was knocked down via Cdk5-small interfering RNA by as much as 86% in porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing human (h)DATs. However, Cdk5 depletion did not alter hDAT activity. Taken together, our results suggest that roscovitine inhibits DAT activity independently of Cdk5; therefore, results obtained with such inhibitors should be interpreted with caution. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Cdk5 inhibitors reduce brain DAT activity via a mechanism that is independent of DAT trafficking and reverse-transport.",M2
19621370,"Variation in TREK1 gene linked to depression-resistant phenotype is associated with potentiated neural responses to rewards in humans.The TREK1 gene has been linked to a depression-resistant phenotype in rodents and antidepressant response in humans, but the neural mechanisms underlying these links are unclear. Because TREK1 is expressed in reward-related basal ganglia regions, it has been hypothesized that TREK1 genetic variation may be associated with anhedonic symptoms of depression. To investigate whether TREK1 genetic variation influences reward processing, we genotyped healthy individuals (n = 31) who completed a monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Three genotypes previously linked to positive antidepressant response were associated with potentiated basal ganglia activity to gains, but did not influence responses to penalties or no change feedback. TREK1 genetic variations did not affect basal ganglia volume, and fMRI group differences were confirmed when accounting for self-report measures of anhedonia. In addition, the total number of  protective  TREK1 alleles was associated with stronger responses to gains in several other reward-related regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and mesial prefrontal cortex. In control analyses, associations between basal ganglia responses to gains and functional polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes were also explored. Results revealed that TREK1 and <e>DAT</e>/COMT genotypes were independently related to basal ganglia responses to gains. These findings indicate that TREK1 genotypes are associated with individual differences in reward-related brain activity. Future studies in depressed samples should evaluate whether variation in neural responses to rewards may contribute to the association between TREK1 and antidepressant response in humans.",M2
19615345,"Genetic alteration in the dopamine transporter differentially affects male and female nigrostriatal transporter systems.Female mice with a heterozygous mutation of their dopamine transporter (+/- <e>DAT</e>) showed relatively robust reductions in striatal DAT specific binding (38-50%), while +/- DAT males showed modest reductions (24-32%). Significant decreases in substantia nigra DAT specific binding (42%) and mRNA (24%) were obtained in +/- DAT females, but not +/- DAT males (19% and 5%, respectively). The effects of this DAT perturbation upon vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) function revealed significantly greater reserpine-evoked DA output from +/+ and +/- DAT female as compared to male mice and the DA output profile differed markedly between +/+ and +/- DAT females, but not males. No changes in VMAT-2 protein or mRNA levels were present among these conditions. On the basis of these data, we propose: (1) a genetic mutation of the DAT does not exert equivalent effects upon the DAT in female and male mice, with females being more affected; (2) an alteration in the DAT may also affect VMAT-2 function; (3) this interaction between DAT and VMAT-2 function is more prevalent in female mice; and (4) the +/- DAT mutation affects VMAT-2 function through an indirect mechanism, that does not involve an alteration in VMAT-2 protein or mRNA. Such DAT/VMAT-2 interactions can be of significance to the gender differences observed in drug addiction and Parkinson's disease.",M2
19607959,"Monoamine transporter as a target molecule for psychostimulants.Methamphetamine (MAP), a drug of abuse known worldwide for its addictive effects and neurotoxicity, causes somatic and psychiatric disorders. MAP enters terminals/neurons via monoamine transporters, displaces both vesicular and intracellular monoamines, and facilitates the release of monoamines into the extraneuronal space through synaptic transport via the monoamine transporters. Chronic psychostimulant abusers exhibit psychotic features, including delusions and auditory hallucinations. The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) play pivotal roles in the action of MAP, including locomotor effects. The deletion of DAT attenuates the locomotor effects of MAP and may play larger role in behavioral responses to MAP compared to the deletion of VMAT2. MAP produces hyperthermia and/or neuronal toxicity in most species. The effects of MAP in DAT or serotonin transporter (SERT) single knockout (KO) mice and DAT/SERT double KO mice suggested that DAT and SERT are key molecules for hyperthermia and neuronal toxicity of MAP.",M2
19602552,"Lack of cocaine self-administration in mice expressing a cocaine-insensitive dopamine transporter.Cocaine addiction is a worldwide public health problem for which there are no established treatments. The dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) is suspected as the primary target mediating cocaine's abuse-related effects based on numerous pharmacological studies. However, in a previous study, DAT knockout mice were reported to self-administer cocaine, generating much debate regarding the importance of the DAT in cocaine's abuse-related effects. Here, we show that mice expressing a  knockin  of a cocaine-insensitive but functional DAT did not self-administer cocaine intravenously despite normal food-maintained responding and normal intravenous self-administration of amphetamine and a direct dopamine agonist. Our results have three implications. First, they imply a crucial role for high-affinity DAT binding of cocaine in mediating its reinforcing effects, reconciling mouse genetic engineering approaches with data from classic pharmacological studies. Second, they demonstrate the usefulness of knockin strategies that modify specific amino acid sequences within a protein. Third, they show that it is possible to alter the DAT protein sequence in such a way as to selectively target its interaction with cocaine, while sparing other behaviors dependent on DAT function. Thus, molecular engineering technology could advance the development of highly specialized compounds such as a dopamine-sparing  cocaine antagonist. ",M2
19590691,"Dopamine transporter genetic variants and pesticides in Parkinson's disease.BACKGROUND: Research suggests that independent and joint effects of genetic variability in the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) locus and pesticides may influence Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. MATERIALS: METHODS: In 324 incident PD patients and 334 population controls from our rural California case-control study, we genotyped rs2652510, rs2550956 (for the DAT 5' clades), and the 3' variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Using geographic information system methods, we determined residential exposure to agricultural maneb and paraquat applications. We also collected occupational pesticide use data. Employing logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for clade diplotypes, VNTR genotype, and number of susceptibility (A clade and 9-repeat) alleles and assessed susceptibility allele-pesticide interactions. RESULTS: PD risk was increased separately in DAT A clade diplotype carriers [AA vs. BB: OR = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.57] and 3' VNTR 9/9 carriers (9/9 vs. 10/10: OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96-3.57), and our data suggest a gene dosing effect. Importantly, high exposure to paraquat and maneb in carriers of one susceptibility allele increased PD risk 3-fold (OR = 2.99; 95% CI, 0.88-10.2), and in carriers of two or more alleles more than 4-fold (OR = 4.53; 95% CI, 1.70-12.1). We obtained similar results for occupational pesticide measures. DISCUSSION: Using two independent pesticide measures, we a) replicated previously reported gene-environment interactions between DAT genetic variants and occupational pesticide exposure in men and b) overcame previous limitations of nonspecific pesticide measures and potential recall bias by employing state records and computer models to estimate residential pesticide exposure. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DAT genetic variability and pesticide exposure interact to increase PD risk.",M2
19590515,"Association between dopaminergic genes (SLC6A3 and DRD2) and stuttering among Han Chinese.Normal function of the dopaminergic system is necessary for speech fluency. There was evidence that the activities of dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) could be altered in people with speech disfluency. This study aims to ascertain the possible correlation between two dopaminergic genes (SLC6A3 and DRD2) and disorder of speech fluency, and to determine the allelic frequencies of the five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2617604, rs28364997, rs28364998 in SLC6A3 and rs6275, rs6277 in DRD2) among Han Chinese patients with this disorder. A sample of 112 patients with speech disfluency and 112 gender-matched controls were included in this case-control study. The results show that the presence of C allele at rs6277 in DRD2 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to the disorder, whereas T allele is protective. Haplotype 939T/957T is also a protective factor.",M2
19588472,"Ex vivo and in vivo evaluation of [18F]PR04.MZ in rodents: a selective dopamine transporter imaging agent.N-4-Fluorobut-2-yn-1-yl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-phenyltropane (PR04.MZ) has been developed as dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) ligand for molecular imaging. It contains a terminally fluorinated, conformationally constrained nitrogen substituent that is well suited for the introduction of fluorine-18. The present report describes the pharmacological characterisation of [18F]PR04.MZ. The ligand shows an IC50 value of 2 nM against human DAT, whereas the IC50 value against human serotonin transporter and human noradrenalin transporter are lower (110 nM and 22 nM, respectively). Furthermore, its ex vivo organ distribution, its binding profile in the rat brain and reversibility of binding were examined. A muPET study illuminates a fast kinetic profile and specific binding to rat DAT.",M2
19580849,"Social and physical environment alter cocaine conditioned place preference and dopaminergic markers in adolescent male rats.This study was done to determine whether social and environmental factors alter cocaine reward and proteins implicated in mediating drug reward in rats during early adolescence. On postnatal day (PND) 23, rats were housed under conditions where both social (number of rats per cage) and environmental (availability of toys) factors were manipulated. Socially isolated rats were housed alone impoverished with no toys (II) or enriched with toys (IE). Social rats were housed two rats/cage with no toys (SI2) or with toys (SE2), or three/cage with (SE3) or without (SI3) toys. On PND 43, cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) sessions began with the post-test done on PND 47. Cocaine CPP was established in response to 5 or 10 mg/kg cocaine in II rats, and CPP was decreased with the addition of cage mates or toys. No CPP was seen to any dose in SI3 or SE3 rats. Enriched housing (SE3) increased dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) protein in the nucleus accumbens compared to II. There also were differential effects of cocaine on tyrosine hydroxylase and DAT depending on housing, with both increased by cocaine in II but not SE3 rats. DARPP-32 was unchanged by housing or cocaine, while phospho-Thr(34)-DARPP-32 was increased by cocaine treatment across conditions. Thus, both social and environmental enrichment decrease cocaine CPP during adolescence and different housing alters proteins that regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission in a manner that may account for the observed differences in cocaine-induced reward.",M2
19577467,"Synthesis, radiolabeling and preliminary in vivo evaluation of [18F]FE-PE2I, a new probe for the dopamine transporter.A new dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) ligand, (E)-N-(3-iodoprop-2-enyl)-2beta-carbofluoroethoxy-3beta-(4'-methyl-phenyl) nortropane (FE-PE2I, 6), derived from PE2I (1), was prepared and found to be a potent inhibitor of rodent DAT in vitro. Compound 6 was radiolabelled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2)=109.8 min) for PET studies in monkeys. In vivo PET measurements showed a regional distribution in brain that corresponds to the known distribution of DAT. This binding was specific, reversible and the kinetics of [(18)F]6 binding in brain were faster than for its lead compound, [(11)C]1. The possible presence of a hydroxymethyl-radiometabolite formed by oxidation in the 3beta-benzylic position of [(18)F]6 warrants further detailed evaluation of the metabolism of [(18)F]6. [(18)F]6 is a potential radioligand for imaging DATs in the human brain with PET.",M2
19571144,"Dopamine signaling is required for depolarization-induced slow current in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Brief strong depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells produces a slow inward cation current. This current, called depolarization-induced slow current (DISC), is triggered by Ca influx in the Purkinje cell and is attenuated by a blocker of vesicular fusion. Previous work in other brain regions, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, has shown that dopamine can be released from dendrites to produce paracrine and autocrine signaling. Here, we test the hypothesis that postsynaptic release of dopamine and autocrine activation of dopamine receptors is involved in DISC. Light immunohistochemistry showed that D(3) dopamine receptors, vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine plasma membrane transporters (<e>DATs</e>) were all expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, their expression was strongest in the gyrus region of cerebellar lobules IX and X. Comparison of DISC across lobules revealed that it was weak in the anterior portions of the cerebellum (lobules II, V, and VI) and strong in lobules IX and X. DISC was blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists (haloperidol, clozapine, eticlopride, and SCH23390). Likewise, DISC was strongly attenuated by inhibitors of VMAT (reserpine and tetrabenazine) and DAT (GBR12909 and rimcazole). These drugs did not produce DISC attenuation through blockade of depolarization-evoked Purkinje cell Ca transients. Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices derived from DAT-null mice expressed DISC, but this DISC ran down at a significantly higher rate than littermate controls. Together, these results suggest that strong Purkinje cell depolarization produces Ca-dependent release of vesicular postsynaptic dopamine that then excites Purkinje cells in an autocrine manner.",M2
19564918,"Dopamine transporters in striatum correlate with deactivation in the default mode network during visuospatial attention.BACKGROUND: Dopamine and dopamine transporters (<e>DAT</e>, which regulate extracellular dopamine in the brain) are implicated in the modulation of attention but their specific roles are not well understood. Here we hypothesized that dopamine modulates attention by facilitation of brain deactivation in the default mode network (DMN). Thus, higher striatal DAT levels, which would result in an enhanced clearance of dopamine and hence weaker dopamine signals, would be associated to lower deactivation in the DMN during an attention task. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For this purpose we assessed the relationship between DAT in striatum (measured with positron emission tomography and [(11)C]cocaine used as DAT radiotracer) and brain activation and deactivation during a parametric visual attention task (measured with blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging) in healthy controls. We show that DAT availability in caudate and putamen had a negative correlation with deactivation in ventral parietal regions of the DMN (precuneus, BA 7) and a positive correlation with deactivation in a small region in the ventral anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32). With increasing attentional load, DAT in caudate showed a negative correlation with load-related deactivation increases in precuneus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide evidence that dopamine transporters modulate neural activity in the DMN and anterior cingulate gyrus during visuospatial attention. Our findings suggest that dopamine modulates attention in part by regulating neuronal activity in posterior parietal cortex including precuneus (region involved in alertness) and cingulate gyrus (region deactivated in proportion to emotional interference). These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of stimulant medications (increase dopamine by blocking DAT) in inattention reflect in part their ability to facilitate the deactivation of the DMN.",M2
19562698,"In vitro autoradiography and in vivo evaluation in cynomolgus monkey of [18F]FE-PE2I, a new dopamine transporter PET radioligand.This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of a new dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) radioligand, [(18)F]fluoroethyl(FE)PE2I, by autoradiography from postmortem human brain and by positron emission tomography (PET) in three cynomolgus monkeys. In the autoradiography experiments, high [18F]FE-PE2I accumulation was observed in caudate and putamen that was selectively abolished by GBR12909 or beta-CIT but not by maprotiline. High doses of citalopram (&gt;5 microM) also inhibited [18F]FE-PE2I binding in the striatum. In vitro Ki of the radioligand was 12 nM at rodent dopamine transporter. [18F]FE-PE2I brain uptake measured by PET was approximately 4-5% of the injected dose, with highest uptake in striatum followed by midbrain and thalamus, lower uptake in neocortex, and lowest in cerebellum. Peak specific binding in striatum was reached approximately 40 min and in midbrain 20-30 min postinjection. The ratio-to-cerebellum was 7-10 in striatum and 1.5-2.3 in midbrain. BP(ND) measured with simplified reference tissue method using the cerebellum as reference region was 4.5 in striatum and 0.6 in midbrain. No displacement was shown after citalopram or maprotiline administration, while GBR12909 decreased the binding in striatum and midbrain to the level of cerebellum. [18F]FE-PE2I showed relatively fast elimination and metabolism with the presence of two metabolite peaks with similar retention time as the labeled metabolites of [11C]PE2I. [18F]FE-PE2I showed in vivo selectivity for the DAT and compared with [11C]PE2I, it showed faster kinetics and earlier peak equilibrium. The potential influence of the two radiometabolites on PET quantification requires further evaluation.",M2
19560930,"An extended study of dimeric phenyl tropanes.A series of dimeric phenyl tropanes consisting of two molecules of 4-chloro, 4-iodo or 4-(3-thiopheno)-phenyl tropane tethered together at the carboxylic acid moiety by a diamine or diol linker were prepared. The diamines used were a variety of linear, cyclic and aromatic diamines, while the diol tethered compounds were prepared by 'click' chemistry and contained a triazole in the linker. The new compounds were tested for binding to hDAT, hSERT and hNET. Amide linked chlorophenyl tropanes with an aromatic linker was found to be potent and selective <e>DAT</e> inhibitors with the best K(i) value for hDAT being 6nM. The ester linked halophenyl tropanes were more potent but displayed little selectivity in inhibition of monoamine transporter binding. Among the studied compounds an ester linker of 10 atoms between the tropane moieties gave the highest affinity. One monomeric phenyl tropane was made for comparison and was found to be less potent than the dimeric counterparts towards SERT and NET but remain highly active against DAT. Dimeric thiophenophenyl tropanes were in general found to be comparatively poor monoamine transporter binders, but significant gains of affinity of up to 45-fold could be achieved with selected dimeric chlorophenyl tropanes compared to the parent monomer. This observation implies that a secondary binding site that has affinity for phenyl tropanes, most likely the putative S2 site, is located within 13A of the primary central S1 binding site.",M2
19560905,"Neural response to lidocaine in healthy subjects.Recent studies suggest that some of cocaine's central nervous system (CNS) effects may be mediated through its sodium channel inhibiting local anesthetic properties. Local anesthetics that lack cocaine's strong affinity for the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) also produce sensory and mood effects, further suggesting a role for this neural pathway. Due to an absence of affinity at the DAT, the local anesthetic lidocaine may offer the potential to assess sodium channel activity in vivo in humans. To assess the utility of lidocaine as a CNS probe, we determined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) following the intravenous administration of lidocaine (0.5 mg/kg) and compared this response to procaine (0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg), a local anesthetic with partial affinity for the DAT, and saline. Infusions were administered in nine healthy female controls over a 10-day period with at least 2 days between each scan. Increased rCBF was observed following lidocaine, relative to saline, in the insula, caudate, thalamus, and posterior cingulate. Decreased rCBF was detected in a different region of the posterior cingulate. In general, increases in rCBF were more marked following lidocaine relative to procaine. Mood and sensory changes following lidocaine were limited and significantly less than those induced by either dose of procaine. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate following either medication. These findings suggest that lidocaine can be safely used to assess sodium channel function in persons with addictive and other psychiatric disorders.",M2
19560533,"Altered levels of synapsin I, dopamine transporter, dynorphin A, and neuropeptide Y in the nucleus accumbens and striatum at post-puberty in rats treated neonatally with pregnenolone or DHEA.It is well documented that neonatal neurosteroid administration influences brain development. In our previous studies, administration of pregnenolone, the precursor of neurosteroids, during the neonatal period altered the activity of dopamine (DA) in the striatum. Furthermore, neonatal treatment with pregnenolone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) increased synapse-related protein synapsin I as well as neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hippocampus. The present study examined the effects of neonatal treatment with pregnenolone or DHEA on synapsin I, DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>), dynorphin A, and NPY in the striatum and the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens at post-puberty. Administration of pregnenolone or DHEA during the neonatal period increased immunodensity of synapsin I in the dorsomedial or ventrolateral striatum. DAT immunodensity in the striatum and the nucleus accumbens core as well as dynorphin A immunodensity in the nucleus accumbens core were increased in DHEA-treated but not in pregnenolone-treated rats. In addition, the size, but not numbers, of NPY-positive cells in the nucleus accumbens core was increased in pregnenolone- and DHEA-treated rats. The results suggest that neurosteroid levels during the neonatal period have larger impact on synaptic formation, development of DA and NPY systems in the nigrostriatal rather than the mesolimbic pathway.",M2
19560046,"Trafficking of dopamine transporters in psychostimulant actions.Brain dopamine (DA) plays a pivotal role in drug addiction. Since the plasma membrane DA transporter (<e>DAT</e>) is critical for terminating DA neurotransmission, it is important to understand how DATs are regulated and this regulation impacts drug addiction. The number of cell surface DATs is controlled by constitutive and regulated endocytic trafficking. Psychostimulants impact this trafficking. Amphetamines, DAT substrates, cause rapid up-regulation and slower down-regulation of DAT whereas cocaine, a DAT inhibitor, increases surface DATs. Recent reports have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these psychostimulant effects and link changes in DAT trafficking to psychostimulant-induced reward/reinforcement in animal models.",M2
19550362,"Cardiac repolarization and striatal dopamine transporter function are interrelated.OBJECTIVE: In Parkinson's disease, striatal dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) binding and cardiac sympathetic function are disturbed. In addition, heart rate (HR)-corrected cardiac repolarisation time (QTc interval), which is partly under autonomic control, is prolonged. Whether there is physiological coupling between striatal DAT binding and QTc time (QTc-DAT relation) is not known. The purpose of this study is to evaluate QTc-DAT relation in healthy young adults. METHODS: Thirty-five participants (18 women, age 26.4+/-1.8 years; mean+/-SD) were studied with iodine-123 labelled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane single photon emission tomography. Signal-averaged ECG was recorded at rest from each participant. QTc interval was computed with Bazett's correction and with the approach by Karjalainen, getting QTc and QTk intervals, respectively. RESULTS: Mean striatal DAT binding, as (striatum-cerebellum)/cerebellum, was 2.63+/-0.31. Mean HR, QT, QTc and QTk intervals were 66+/-9 bpm, 340+/-25 ms, 354+/-18 ms and 351+/-16 ms, respectively. HR-QT correlation was -0.63, P value of less than 0.001. HR was not related to striatal DAT binding. QTc-DAT and QTk-DAT relations were significant, r = -0.50, P = 0.004 and r = -0.59, P = 0.0002, respectively. In linear regression model, striatal DAT binding explained 35% of the variance of QTk interval (95% confidence interval: -46.9 to -13.0, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This study suggests significant physiological QTc-DAT relation in young healthy adults. QTc interval measurements might carry diagnostically important information in clinical conditions, which have an effect on both striatal DAT binding and cardiac sympathetic function.",M2
19542944,"Dopamine transporter SPECT/CT and perfusion brain SPECT imaging in idiopathic basal ganglia calcinosis.A case of idiopathic basal ganglia calcification in a 56-year-old woman with parkinsonism and cognitive impairment is described. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and regional cerebral blood flow were evaluated using dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) brain single photon emission tomography combined with a low-dose x-ray computerized tomography transmission (hybrid SPECT/CT) and Tc-99m HMPAO brain perfusion SPECT study, respectively. DAT SPECT/CT imaging revealed a reduction in DAT binding in both striatum regions coinciding with bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia. Brain perfusion scan showed hypoperfusion in basal ganglia regions, posterior parietal cortex bilaterally, left frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left temporal lobe. These findings correlated well with the clinical condition of the patient. Mineralization may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration. Cortical perfusion changes in patients may better explain the patient's altered cognitive and motor functions.",M2
19531209,"Nongenomic mechanisms of physiological estrogen-mediated dopamine efflux.BACKGROUND: Neurological diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders that vary depending on female life stages suggest that sex hormones may influence the function of neurotransmitter regulatory machinery such as the dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>). RESULTS: In this study we tested the rapid nongenomic effects of several physiological estrogens [estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3)] on dopamine efflux via the DAT in a non-transfected, NGF-differentiated, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell model that expresses membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha, beta, and GPR30. We examined kinase, ionic, and physical interaction mechanisms involved in estrogenic regulation of the DAT function. E2-mediated dopamine efflux is DAT-specific and not dependent on extracellular Ca2+-mediated exocytotic release from vesicular monoamine transporter vesicles (VMATs). Using kinase inhibitors we also showed that E2-mediated dopamine efflux is dependent on protein kinase C and MEK activation, but not on PI3K or protein kinase A. In plasma membrane there are ligand-independent associations of ERalpha and ERbeta (but not GPR30) with DAT. Conditions which cause efflux (a 9 min 10(-9) M E2 treatment) cause trafficking of ERalpha (stimulatory) to the plasma membrane and trafficking of ERbeta (inhibitory) away from the plasma membrane. In contrast, E1 and E3 can inhibit efflux with a nonmonotonic dose pattern, and cause DAT to leave the plasma membrane. CONCLUSION: Such mechanisms explain how gender biases in some DAT-dependent diseases can occur.",M2
19525450,"Pretreatment with haloperidol reduces (123)I-FP-CIT binding to the dopamine transporter in the rat striatum: an in vivo imaging study with a dedicated small-animal SPECT camera.Synaptic dopamine is mainly regulated by presynaptic dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) activity. We hypothesized that variations in synaptic dopamine are reflected by variations of DAT radioligand binding. The effect of haloperidol, which increases synaptic dopamine concentrations, was therefore assessed in the rat striatum using (123)I-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane ((123)I-FP-CIT) as a DAT radioligand. METHODS: Striatal (123)I-FP-CIT binding was measured in 24 rats under baseline conditions (no pretreatment) and at 1 h after injection of haloperidol or a vehicle (1 mg/kg) using a small-animal SPECT camera. RESULTS: Baseline equilibrium ratios (V(3)'') were 1.32 +/- 0.24 (mean +/- SD). After the haloperidol injection, V(3)'' decreased to 0.99 +/- 0.38 (P(2-tailed) &lt; 0.0001), corresponding to a mean reduction of DAT binding by 25%. CONCLUSION: Our results are indicative of competition between the DAT ligand (123)I-FP-CIT and synaptic dopamine elevated by haloperidol, suggesting that the assessment of (123)I-FP-CIT binding may be suitable to study variations in synaptic dopamine in vivo.",M2
19555740,"Sustained depolarization decreases calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity and gene expression in dopamine neurons.Altered gene expression mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and other intracellular signaling molecules plays an important role in activity-dependent neuroplasticity. We discovered that sustained depolarization induced by KCl, a commonly used paradigm for studying activity-dependent gene expression, surprisingly caused a decrease in CaMKII activity in rat mesencephalic dopamine neurons. This decrease in CaMKII activity, after 2 days of depolarization, occurred in the presence of a continued elevation in intracellular calcium concentration. An increase in calyculin-sensitive phosphatase activity was at least partly responsible for the decrease in CaMKII activity. Phosphatase assays revealed that activity but not the abundance of protein phosphatase-2A was increased by sustained depolarization. Decreased CaMKII activity was accompanied by a selective decrease in dopamine transporter (<e>DAT</e>) mRNA, while tyrosine hydroxylase and actin mRNA abundance was unaltered. On the other hand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA abundance was increased by sustained depolarization, further demonstrating the specificity of changes. Depolarization also caused a significant decrease in DAT protein abundance and DAT-mediated uptake. Taken together, these data illustrate a novel signaling paradigm in which the activity of protein phosphatase-2A is associated with CaMKII activity and gene expression.",M2
19553461,"Hyperdopaminergia and NMDA receptor hypofunction disrupt neural phase signaling.Neural phase signaling has gained attention as a putative coding mechanism through which the brain binds the activity of neurons across distributed brain areas to generate thoughts, percepts, and behaviors. Neural phase signaling has been shown to play a role in various cognitive processes, and it has been suggested that altered phase signaling may play a role in mediating the cognitive deficits observed across neuropsychiatric illness. Here, we investigated neural phase signaling in two mouse models of cognitive dysfunction: mice with genetically induced hyperdopaminergia [dopamine transporter knock-out (<e>DAT</e>-KO) mice] and mice with genetically induced NMDA receptor hypofunction [NMDA receptor subunit-1 knockdown (NR1-KD) mice]. Cognitive function in these mice was assessed using a radial-arm maze task, and local field potentials were recorded from dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as DAT-KO mice, NR1-KD mice, and their littermate controls engaged in behavioral exploration. Our results demonstrate that both DAT-KO and NR1-KD mice display deficits in spatial cognitive performance. Moreover, we show that persistent hyperdopaminergia alters interstructural phase signaling, whereas NMDA receptor hypofunction alters interstructural and intrastructural phase signaling. These results demonstrate that dopamine and NMDA receptor dependent glutamate signaling play a critical role in coordinating neural phase signaling, and encourage further studies to investigate the role that deficits in phase signaling play in mediating cognitive dysfunction.",M2
