19901712,"Sjogren-larsson syndrome: case report and review of neurologic abnormalities and ichthyosis.INTRODUCTION: Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is characterized by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. The hallmark of SLS is ichthyosis. We report a case and review the major differential diagnosis of SLS. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old woman presented with seizures, mental retardation, spastic diplegia, and ichthyosis since birth. Computed tomography scan revealed hypodense areas in the periventricular white matter. Skin biopsy demonstrated a lamellar ichthyosis. These findings were compatible with SLS. CONCLUSION: When ichthyosis is associated with spasticity and mental retardation, one should consider SLS. If hypogonadism, ataxia, retinitis, cardiomyopathy, or dwarfism is present, other diagnosis rather than SLS should be investigated.",M1
19656702,"MR spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging of the brain in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is reported for the first time in a patient with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed normal levels of choline, creatine and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and the characteristic lipid signals in the white matter brain tissue. Conventional MRI showed increased signal intensity around the lateral ventricles indicating abnormal myelination. DTI revealed normal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, but reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter. After co-registration of the parameters obtained with DTI with the results of MRS (36 voxels), significant correlations were obtained of lipid content with FA (r=0.81), ADC (r=-0.62), choline (r=0.51), and NAA (r=0.44) (P&lt;0.01, all). These results suggest that in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, the white matter lipid signals originate from the neurons, with NAA and choline reflecting neuron density and myelination. The comparatively high FA/low ADC values in these lipid-rich locations, indicate a loss of diffusion in directions perpendicular to the fibers. The overall loss of FA in the white matter may reflect a loss of brain tissue water content in <e>SLS</e> patients compared with controls and precede the formation of atrophy.",M1
19340663,"Speech-language performance in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To describe speech-language pathology in patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) in relation to their cognitive and motor impairment. DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: Cognitive functioning was assessed in 16 patients with SLS (nine males; seven females) using different neuropsychological tests. Speech-language pathology was studied focusing on dysarthria, oral motor functioning, speech intelligibility and language development. Potential correlations between speech-language pathology and other neurological symptoms (e.g. spasticity) were studied. RESULTS: The median cognitive developmental age was 5;8 (n = 13; range 3;5-8;0) years. A variable degree of mainly pseudobulbar dysarthria was found. Speech intelligibility was influenced by dysarthria, but was also related to language pathology. No correlation between motor functioning and dysarthria or cognitive development was observed. CONCLUSION: Dysarthria and language problems are important factors in daily life functioning of patients with SLS. Based upon the clinical profile found, early speech-language therapy is recommended in order to optimize their speech-language development.",M1
19197545,"Sjögren-larsson syndrome: a study of clinical symptoms and dermatological treatment in 34 Swedish patients.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is a recessively inherited disease with congenital ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia and mental retardation, caused by a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. The aim of this study was to examine all 34 Swedish patients with SLS, emphasizing skin symptoms, dermatological treatment, and neurological symptoms (evaluated in some cases for more than 25 years by one and the same investigator). Structured interviews were conducted with the patients and their close relatives. All patients had generalized ichthyosis. The degree of scaling varied markedly inter-individually from moderate to severe, but there was no obvious change with age. Most patients had pruritus, suffered from hypohidrosis, and had palmo-plantar keratoderma. Nineteen patients (56%) were on oral acitretin and all patients were using some type of topical therapy. Motor disability with spasticity and muscular paresis was most pronounced in the legs and fairly slight in the arms. Twenty patients (59%) were dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. Poor blood circulation in the lower legs and oedematous feet were frequently found in adults. All patients had learning disability, which varied from slight to pronounced and was expressed in their speech disorders. Thirteen patients (38%) were being treated medically for epilepsy and all had photophobia. In conclusion, SLS is a chronic, severely disabling neurocutaneous disease in which optimal dermatological therapy is essential to relieve at least the patient's ichthyosis problem.",M1
19124283,"Enzymatic diagnosis of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.BACKGROUND: Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a metabolic disorder characterized by accumulation of long-chain fatty alcohols in plasma of patients due to mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene, that codes for a microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). Recent studies have demonstrated that FALDH is involved in the last step of the conversion of 22-hydroxy-C22:0 into the dicarboxylic acid of C22:0 (C22:0-DCA). METHODS: FALDH activity was determined by incubating fibroblast homogenates with omega-hydroxy-C22:0 in the presence of NAD(+). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to quantify the amounts of C22:0-DCA produced. RESULTS: All <e>SLS</e> patients were deficient in C22:0-DCA productions with activities ranging from 3.2-26.3% of mean control. CONCLUSIONS: The new assay described in this paper has substantial advantages over previous assays, and allows for the easy, reliable and rapid diagnosis of SLS.",M1
18173629,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: motor performance and everyday functioning in 17 patients.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder characterized by spasticity, learning disability, and ichthyosis. To our knowledge, there is no detailed report in the literature concerning the functional consequences of SLS. Therefore, we performed a cross-sectional study of motor performance and everyday functioning in 17 patients with this rare disorder. Nine female and eight male patients with SLS (age range 1-35y) were investigated. Data were obtained by structured interview with parents and patients with SLS, a telephone-conducted questionnaire, and physical examination. Motor performance was measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure; everyday functioning was assessed using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. In most patients, spasticity was bilaterally present in hamstrings, hip adductors, and gastrocnemic muscles. All participants above 7 years had contractures in the lower extremities. Limitations were present in all gross motor dimensions, except for lying and rolling. Participants had developmental ages far below their chronological age. This study revealed that patients with SLS have limitations in gross motor performance. Although some patients can reach a certain level of independence, most have activity limitations and restrictions in their participation in society.",M1
17971613,"Abnormal fatty alcohol metabolism in cultured keratinocytes from patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). FALDH is an enzyme component of fatty alcohol:NAD oxidoreductase (FAO), which is necessary for fatty alcohol metabolism. To better understand the biochemical basis for the cutaneous symptoms in this disease, we investigated lipid metabolism in cultured keratinocytes from SLS patients. Enzyme activities of FALDH and FAO in SLS cells were &lt;10% of normal. SLS keratinocytes accumulated 45-fold more fatty alcohol (hexadecanol, octadecanol, and octadecenol) than normal, whereas wax esters and 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerols were increased by 5.6-fold and 7.5-fold, respectively. SLS keratinocytes showed a reduced incorporation of radioactive octadecanol into fatty acid (24% of normal) and triglyceride (13% of normal), but incorporation into wax esters and 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol was increased by 2.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. Our results indicate that FALDH deficiency in SLS keratinocytes causes the accumulation and diversion of fatty alcohol into alternative biosynthetic pathways. The striking lipid abnormalities in cultured SLS keratinocytes are distinct from those seen in fibroblasts and may be related to the stratum corneum dysfunction and ichthyosis in SLS.",M1
17902024,"Novel and recurrent ALDH3A2 mutations in Italian patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>; MIM#270200) is an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disease caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of medium- and long- chain aliphatic aldehydes fatty acids. We studied two unrelated Italian SLS patients with ichthyosis, developmental delay, spastic diplegia and brain white matter disease. One patient was homozygous for a novel ALDH3A2 insertion mutation (c.767insA) in exon 5. The other SLS patient was a compound heterozygote for two previously reported mutations: a slice site mutation (c.1094C &gt; T; S365L) in exon 7. Analysis of fibroblast RNA by RT-PCR indicated that the spice-site mutation caused skipping of exons 2 and 3. The c.1094C &gt; T mutation, previously associated with two ALDH3A2 haplotypes, was found on a third distinct haplotype in our patient, which indicates that arose independently in this kindred. These results add to understanding of the genetic basis of SLS and will be useful for DNA diagnosis of this disease.",M1
17826835,"Subclinical changes in the juvenile crystalline macular dystrophy in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome detected by optical coherence tomography.PURPOSE: To study morphologic changes in the macula by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with a crystalline macular dystrophy due to the autosomal recessive neurocutaneous Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>). DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven eyes of 14 patients, mean age 14.6 (range, 3-24) years, with biochemically and genetically proven SLS underwent clinical and OCT investigation between September 2004 and September 2006. METHODS: All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination including slit-lamp biomicroscopy and binocular ophthalmoscopy. Optical coherence tomography of all eyes was performed using the macular thickness map protocol of Stratus OCT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular morphology in clinical examination and OCT. RESULTS: Beside clinically visible perimacular crystalline deposits in all eyes of all study participants, macular morphology and reflectivity were significantly changed on OCT compared with healthy eyes. We found focal hyperreflectivities in all study eyes within the perifoveal ganglion cell layer and the inner plexiform layer, corresponding to the clinical localization of retinal crystals. More interestingly, a cystoid foveal degeneration on OCT was present in the majority of patients with SLS (18/27 eyes, or 67% of all eyes studied), varying from multiple microcystoid spaces to cystoid foveal atrophy. In general, patients who were severely affected on OCT showed intense changes on previously performed cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLS show a childhood-onset crystalline macular dystrophy with cystoid foveal atrophy on OCT in most cases. The intraretinal deposition of lipid metabolites may lead to Müller cell degeneration with subsequent formation of cystoid spaces or atrophic changes within the fovea. Because this macular dystrophy is present in all examined patients with SLS, familiarity with this maculopathy seems important for the diagnosis of this rare systemic disease.",M1
17302612,"Diagnosing Sjögren-Larsson syndrome in a 7-year-old Moroccan boy.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessively inherited neurocutaneous disorder characterized by the triad of congenital ichthyosis, mental deficiency, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. Less common features are retinal changes, short stature, kyphoscoliosis, preterm birth, photophobia, reduction of visual acuity, seizures, and delayed speech. SLS is characterized by a genetic block in the oxidation of fatty alcohol to fatty acid because of deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a component of the fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase enzyme complex. As in other rare multisystem diseases, the diagnosis of SLS is often delayed. The definitive test for SLS is considered the measurement of FALDH or fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase in cultured skin fibroblasts. Nevertheless, if specific FALDH activity test or DNA FALDH gene mutation tests are not available (as in our country), a reliable diagnosis of SLS is also possible when it is based on the matching of peculiar clinical, histologic and ultrastructural, laboratoristic, and imaging features. The simultaneous presence of cutaneous histologic features including hyperkeratosis, orthokeratosis, thickening of granular layer, abnormal lamellar inclusions in the cytoplasm of granular and horny cells (demonstrated by light and electron microscopy) in a child with ichthyosis, and typical neurologic abnormalities is highly suggestive of SLS. We describe the case of a young Moroccan boy presenting with ichthyosis, mental retardation, spastic diplegia, and peculiar skin histologic findings.",M1
16996289,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: molecular genetics and biochemical pathogenesis of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid. Affected patients display ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic diplegia. More than 70 mutations in ALDH3A2 have been discovered in SLS patients including amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions and splicing errors. Most mutations are private, but several common mutations reflect founder effects, consanguinity or recurrent mutational events. FALDH oxidizes fatty aldehyde substrates arising from metabolism of fatty alcohols, leukotriene B4, ether glycerolipids and other potential sources such as sphingolipids. The pathogenesis of the cutaneous and neurologic symptoms is thought to result from abnormal lipid accumulation in the membranes of skin and brain; the formation of aldehyde Schiff base adducts with amine-containing lipids or proteins; or defective eicosanoid metabolism. Therapeutic approaches are being developed to target specific metabolic defects associated with FALDH deficiency or to correct the genetic defect by gene transfer.",M1
16927642,"Texture analysis of the epidermis based on fast Fourier transformation in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether image analysis of routine hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) skin sections using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) could detect structural alterations in patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) diagnosed by molecular biology. STUDY DESIGN: Skin punch biopsies of 9 patients with SLS and 17 healthy volunteers were obtained. Digital images of routine histologic sections were taken, and their gray scale luminance was analyzed by FFT. The inertia values were determined for different ranges of the spatial frequencies in the vertical and horizontal direction. To get an estimation of anisotropy, we calculated the resultant vector of the designated frequency ranges. RESULTS: In the prickle cell layer, SLS patients showed more intense amplitudes in spatial structures with periods between 1.2 and 3.6 microm in the vertical direction, which correlated in part with accentuated nuclei and nucleoli and perinucleolar halos in the H-E sections. In a linear discriminant analysis, the variables derived from the FFT images correctly discriminated 84.6% of the patients. Texture features derived from the gray level cooccurrence matrix were not able to separate the groups. CONCLUSION: Exploratory texture analysis by FFT was able to detect discrete alterations in the prickle cell layer in routine light microscopy slides of SLS patients. The structural changes identified by FFT may be related to abnormal cellular components associated with aberrant lipid metabolism.",M1

Patients present the classical triad of congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic di- or tetraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually shows hypomyelination involving the periventricular white matter. Cerebral proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) reveals a characteristic abnormal lipid peak. We report three cases of SLS from different families with the typical clinical triad. The MRI and (1)H-MRS findings are discussed.",M1

We report a case of SLS in an 11-month-old girl of Lebanese and Mexican-Syrian ancestry who presented with ichthyosis, developmental delay, and spasticity. Results of an enzymatic assay and genomic DNA testing in cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed a homozygous C237Y mutation. These findings support the rich diversity of mutations associated with this syndrome.",M1
16837225,"Bezafibrate induces FALDH in human fibroblasts; implications for Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is caused by a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), encoded by the ALDH3A2 gene. In animal studies, the expression of the murine ortholog of FALDH, has been shown to be under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). In the present study, we investigated whether the hypolipidemic drug bezafibrate, which is a pan-agonist of all PPAR-isoforms, might induce FALDH activity in human fibroblasts of control subjects and SLS patients that still have some residual FALDH activity. Our results show that FALDH activity was induced 1.4-fold after a 3-day treatment with 800 microM bezafibrate in fibroblasts of control subjects. Interestingly, in fibroblasts of two SLS patients homozygous for the p.R228C substitution, FALDH activity could be induced to 37% of control values by bezafibrate treatment. mRNA analysis in fibroblasts of these patients also revealed a mean 1.8-fold induction of FALDH mRNA after bezafibrate treatment. No induction was observed in fibroblasts of patients with mutations that cause instability of FALDH mRNA or that result in a protein without any residual activity. These data suggest that bezafibrate treatment could be effective in patients with expression of FALDH protein and some residual enzyme activity. Further research is needed to resolve whether patients could benefit from treatment with bezafibrate.",M1
16525484,"Restoration of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutation in the ALDH3A2 gene that codes for human fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). Sjögren-Larsson syndrome patients lack FALDH, which catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acids. The impaired FALDH activity leads to congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity. The current lack of treatment is an impetus to develop gene therapy strategies by introducing functional FALDH into defective cells. We delivered human FALDH into keratinocytes of SLS patients using recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 vectors. Transduction of SLS keratinocytes resulted in an augmentation of FALDH activity comparable to phenotypically normal heterozygous carriers. Toxicity of long-chain aldehydes for FALDH-deficient cells decreased almost to the level of unaffected keratinocytes. Three-dimensional culture of corrected SLS keratinocytes revealed an ameliorated FALDH expression. These studies demonstrate the restoration of FALDH in human SLS cells supporting the concept of gene therapy as a potential future treatment option for SLS.",M1
16476818,"Phenotypic variability among adult siblings with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.BACKGROUND: Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an early childhood-onset disorder with ichthyosis, mental retardation, spastic paraparesis, macular dystrophy, and leukoencephalopathy caused by the deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase due to mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (the gene that encodes microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase). Cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in those with SLS demonstrates an abnormal white matter peak at 1.3 ppm, consistent with long-chain fatty alcohol accumulation. OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical course and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic findings of SLS in adults. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case series in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Six siblings of a consanguineous Arab family with early childhood-onset SLS who carry the 682C--&gt;T mutation in the ALDH3A2 gene were reinvestigated in adulthood. RESULTS: The 6 affected siblings ranged in age from 16 to 36 years. All exhibited the typical clinical and imaging manifestations of SLS, but their severity markedly varied. Neurological involvement was apparently nonprogressive, and its severity showed no correlation with age. Cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a lipid peak at 1.3 ppm, with decreasing intensity in the older siblings. CONCLUSION: These observations document significant clinical variability and the nonprogressive neurological course of SLS in adult siblings with the same ALDH3A2 genotype, and demonstrate possible correlation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic changes with age, suggesting unknown pathogenic mechanisms to compensate for the responsible biochemical defect in this disease.",M1
16435189,"A novel assay for the prenatal diagnosis of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is a metabolic disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. The biochemical defect has been identified as a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), which is part of an enzyme complex that converts fatty alcohols into fatty acids. Making use of the finding that FALDH is also involved in the degradation of phytol, we set up an enzymatic assay for the prenatal diagnosis of SLS in cultured chorionic villus fibroblasts (CVF) based on a deficiency in the conversion of phytol to phytenic acid. FALDH activity was assessed by incubating fibroblast homogenates with phytol in the presence of NAD+, followed by hexane extraction of the samples and quantification of phytenic acid production by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). FALDH activity could be detected in cultured CVF cells derived from control fetuses and the activity was found to be markedly deficient in cultured CVF cells derived from an affected SLS fetus. The new assay described in this paper has advantages over previous assays and we conclude that it may well contribute to the prenatal detection of SLS.",M1
15931689,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: diversity of mutations and polymorphisms in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH3A2).Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and ALDH10) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the ALDH3A2 gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic ALDH3A2 polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence. The striking mutational diversity in SLS offers a challenge for DNA-based diagnosis, but promises to provide a wealth of information about enzyme structure-function correlations.",M1
15834613,"Adeno-associated virus vectors are able to restore fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase-deficiency. Implications for gene therapy in Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in the gene coding for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme necessary for the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acid as one enzyme of the fatty alcohol:nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-oxidoreductase complex (FAO). The impaired activity of FALDH leads to the clinical symptom triad of generalized ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. Treatment options are primarily symptomatic. Gene therapy by means of genetic reintroduction of the functional FALDH gene into defective cells has so far not been considered as a therapeutic modality. In order to pursue such an approach for SLS, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 vector containing the human cDNA of functional FALDH and evaluated its capability to restore the enzyme-deficiency in a FALDH-deficient cell line resembling the gene defect of SLS. rAAV-2 transduction of FALDH-deficient cells, usually exhibiting less than 10% of normal FALDH activity, resulted in an increase of FALDH activity within the range of unaffected cells. Moreover, FALDH-transduced cells regained resistance over exposure to long chain aldehydes, which are otherwise toxic to FALDH-deficient cells. These results indicated that rAAV-2 vectors are able to restore FALDH-deficiency in a cell system resembling SLS. The findings give the first support to the concept that gene therapy might be a future option for the treatment of SLS.",M1

15110319,"Identification of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase in the breakdown of phytol to phytanic acid.Phytol is a branched chain fatty alcohol, which is abundantly present in nature as part of the chlorophyll molecule. In its free form, phytol is metabolized to phytanic acid, which accumulates in patients suffering from a variety of peroxisomal disorders, including Refsum disease. The breakdown of phytol to phytanic acid takes place in three steps, in which first, the alcohol is converted to the aldehyde, second the aldehyde is converted to phytenic acid, and finally the double bond is reduced to yield phytanic acid. By culturing fibroblasts in the presence of phytol, increases in the levels of phytenic and phytanic acid were detected. Interestingly, fibroblasts derived from patients affected by Sjögren Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>), known to be deficient in microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) were found to be deficient in this. In addition, fibroblast homogenates of these patients, incubated with phytol in the presence of NAD+ did not produce any phytenic acid. This indicates that FALDH is involved in the breakdown of phytol.",M1

We report the clinical characteristics and the results of molecular studies in 19 SLS patients. Patients 1-17 show the classical triad of severe clinical abnormalities including ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity. Most patients were born preterm, and all patients exhibit ocular abnormalities and pruritus. Electro-encephalography shows a slow background activity, without other abnormalities. MRI of the brain shows an arrest of myelination, periventricular signal abnormalities of white matter and mild ventricular enlargement. Cerebral (1)H-MR spectroscopy reveals a characteristic, abnormal lipid peak. The degree of white matter abnormality in the MRIs and the height of the lipid peak in (1)H-MR spectra do not correlate with the severity of the neurological signs. The clinical presentation and the clinical course is strikingly similar in these patients. Patient 18 shows a mild phenotype that essentially contains the same, but less severe, clinical features. Patient 19 exhibits the typical, but very mild, dermatological and ocular abnormalities, without any clinical neurological involvement. The diagnosis of SLS was confirmed by demonstration of the enzyme defect in cultured skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, as might be predicted from the essential role of FALDH in leucotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) metabolism, elevated urinary concentrations of LTB(4) and 20-OH-LTB(4) were found in all patients studied. Molecular studies of the FALDH gene revealed eight different mutations, including three new ones: a large 26-base pair deletion (21-46del), a missense mutation (80C--&gt;T) and an insertion mutation (487-488insA). The vast majority of SLS patients seem to be severely affected independent of their genotype.",M1
15090362,"MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopic studies in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: characterization of the leukoencephalopathy.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is a neurocutaneous syndrome caused by a genetic enzyme deficiency in lipid metabolism. Our purpose was to characterize the nature of the cerebral involvement in SLS. METHODS: MR imaging was performed in 18 patients (aged 5 months to 45 years) and repeated in 14. Single-voxel proton MR spectra were acquired from cerebral white matter and gray matter in 16 patients, with follow-up studies in 11. LCModel fits were used to determine brain metabolite levels. RESULTS: MR imaging showed retardation of myelination and a mild persistent myelin deficit. A zone of increased signal intensity was seen in the periventricular white matter on T2-weighted images. Proton MR spectroscopy of white matter revealed a prominent peak at 1.3 ppm, normal levels of N-acetylaspartate, and elevated levels of creatine (+14%), choline (+18%), and myo-inositol (+54%). MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy of gray matter were normal. In the two patients examined during the first years of life, abnormalities on MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy gradually emerged and then stabilized, as in all other patients. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities on MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy emerge during the first years of life and are similar in all patients with SLS, but the severity varies. The changes are confined to cerebral white matter and suggest an accumulation of lipids, periventricular gliosis, delayed myelination, and a mild permanent myelin deficit.",M1
11306053,"Fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase: genomic structure, expression and mutation analysis in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) is a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of medium- and long-chain aliphatic aldehydes derived from metabolism of fatty alcohol, phytanic acid, ether glycerolipids and leukotriene B4. The FALDH gene (ALDH3A2) in man and mouse consists of 11 exons and is closely linked to the gene for ALDH3. In both species, alternative splicing results in formation of a second minor protein, FALDHv, that has a unique carboxy-terminal end. The functional significance of this alternate protein is not known. In humans, mutations in the FALDH gene cause Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>), which is characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity. Missense mutations involving 24 amino acid positions in FALDH have been identified. These amino acids are more highly conserved among related class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes than expected, suggesting that they are critically important for protein folding, catalysis or stability. Studies of mutations in SLS should prove useful for understanding structure-function correlations in FALDH and other aldehyde dehydrogenase proteins.",M1
11795678,"Clinical and biochemical effects of zileuton in patients with the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.The Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an inborn error of lipid metabolism, characterised clinically by congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity. Patients also suffer from severe pruritus. The degradation of leukotriene (LT) B4 is one of the defective metabolic routes in SLS. Zileuton inhibits the synthesis of LTB4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Five SLS patients were treated with zileuton for 3 months. Favourable effects were found on pruritus score (P = 0.006), general well-being, and background activity of electroencephalographic studies. Neuropsychological test results did not change significantly. There was, however, a clinically important trend towards improvement in the speed of information processing. Results of cerebral MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not change during therapy. Urinary concentrations of LTB4 and omega-OH-LTB4 decreased significantly (P=0.02 and P=0.003 respectively), while their concentrations in CSF were normal at baseline and remained so after therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome might benefit from treatment with zileuton, especially with respect to the agonising pruritus.

To determine whether microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) is responsible, we investigated the metabolism of 1-O-[9, 10-(3)H-octadecyl]-glycerol ([(3)H]OG) in FALDH-deficient cultured cells from patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) and in mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Intact fibroblasts from SLS patients incubated with [(3)H]OG showed a selective deficiency (38+/-7% of normal) in the incorporation of radioactivity into fatty acid, but no decrease in incorporation of radioactivity into fatty alcohol, total lipids and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Consistent with fatty aldehyde accumulation, incorporation of radioactivity into N-alkyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, which is derived from Schiff base formation of free aldehyde with PE, was 4-fold higher in SLS fibroblasts compared to normal controls. Similar results were seen with SLS keratinocytes, whereas FALDH-deficient CHO cells showed a more profound reduction in radioactive fatty acid to 12+/-2% of normal. These results implicate FALDH in the oxidation of ether-derived fatty aldehyde in human and rodent cells. Metabolism of ether glycerolipids is a previously unrecognized source of fatty aldehyde that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLS.",M1

A moderate decrease in FAO activity has also been reported in heterozygote SLS subjects. Abnormal peaks were detected with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in homozygote SLS subjects. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 1H-MRS can be used to detect metabolic and/or pathological abnormalities in heterozygote SLS subjects. Four SLS heterozygotes were examined using 1H-MRS. A moderate decrease in FAO activity was demonstrated in two of the four heterozygotes. Abnormal peaks were detected at 0.9 ppm in the spectrum from cerebral hemispheres of every heterozygote. 1H-MRS was able to detect an abnormal accumulation of fatty alcohols and lipids, which is expected to increase due to an decrease in FAO activity or dysmyelination in heterozygote SLS subjects. Thus, 1H-MRS is suggested to be a powerful tool in the screening of SLS heterozygotes.",M1

SLS patients have a profound deficiency in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) activity. The human cDNA of FALDH has been shown to map to the SLS locus on chromosome 17p11.2. Here we describe a method based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein truncation test to identify mutations in the FALDH gene in nine German SLS families. Using this detection system both disease-causing mutations were found in eight of the nine SLS families examined (17/18 chromosomes). Seven different mutations were identified: an exon 2 skipping due to exon 2 splice donor mutation; two different exon 3 splice donor mutations resulting in combined exon 2 and 3 skipping; a 906delT deletion in exon 6; a genomic deletion of about 6 kb including exon 9; a 1277T &gt; G transversion resulting in a Leu426Ter nonsense mutation; and a 1297delGA deletion. Two of the mutations identified, the genomic exon 9 deletion and the 906delT in exon 6 affected five out of seven SLS patients from a small region of Northern Bavaria. Therefore these two mutations accounted for 71% (10/14 chromosomes) of Bavarian SLS alleles and so far have not been described in SLS families from other countries. Our findings do not support our 'historical' hypothesis, that a possible region clustering in Northern Bavaria could be due to the presence of Swedish soldiers during the 30 Years War (1618-1648), but suggest that two mutations causing SLS syndrome originated in Northern Bavaria.",M1
11166796,"Defective metabolism of leukotriene B4 in the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.The Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is a neurocutaneous disorder, caused by deficient activity of the microsomal enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). FALDH catalyzes the oxidation of medium- and long-chain fatty aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. SLS is diagnosed by demonstrating the enzyme deficiency or by mutation analysis of the FALDH gene, while laboratory investigations of plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid do not reveal any diagnostic abnormality. Leukotriene (LT) B4 is a pro-inflammatory mediator synthesized from arachidonic acid. LTB4 is inactivated by microsomal omega-oxidation, successively yielding 20-OH-LTB4, 20-CHO-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4. Since FALDH is involved in LTB4 degradation, we have analyzed LTB4 and its metabolites in urine and cerebrospinal fluid as well as the degradation capacity for LTB4 in fresh polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) of SLS patients. The urinary concentrations of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4 are below the detection limit in healthy controls. The urine of all SLS patients (n=13) exhibited highly elevated concentrations of LTB4 and 20-OH-LTB4, while 20-COOH-LTB4 was absent. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4 were found to be normal (n=7). PMN isolated from four patients were shown to be unable to convert 20-OH-LTB4 to 20-COOH-LTB4. Our findings provide unambiguous evidence for defective LTB4 degradation in SLS patients, and offer new and non-invasive diagnostic tools. Moreover, they open new pathophysiological considerations, with the prospect of rational treatment strategies.",M1

10884288,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: accumulation of free fatty alcohols in cultured fibroblasts and plasma.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an inherited disorder associated with deficient oxidation of long-chain aliphatic alcohols. Previous studies have reported modest elevations in total (free + esterified) fatty alcohols in SLS, but free fatty alcohols have not been selectively measured, in part because of their low concentrations in most tissues and the presence of trace fatty alcohol contaminants in some solvents used for their analysis. We adapted methods to measure free fatty alcohols in cultured cells and plasma that minimize exogenous alcohol contamination. Fatty alcohols were analyzed as acetate derivatives, using capillary column gas chromatography. By this method, cultured skin fibroblasts from SLS patients were found to have 7- and 8-fold elevations in the mean content of hexadecanol (16:0-OH) and octadecanol (18:0-OH), respectively. The mean plasma 16:0-OH and 18:0-OH concentrations in SLS patients (n = 11) were 9- and 22-fold higher than in normal controls, respectively. In SLS fibroblasts, most of the fatty alcohol (59%) that accumulated was free rather than esterified alcohol, whereas free alcohol accounted for 23% of the total alcohol in normal cells. These results indicate that elevations in free fatty alcohols provide a sensitive marker for the enzymatic defect in SLS. The ability to measure free fatty alcohols in cultured cells and plasma should prove useful for investigations of normal fatty alcohol metabolism and the deranged metabolism in SLS.",M1
10706028,"Preterm birth in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) was originally described as a triad of spasticity, mental retardation and congenital ichthyosis. The syndrome reflects an underlying deficiency of microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). We report on clinical data concerning pregnancy, labor and neonatal period in 15 patients. Pregnancies were uncomplicated, except for preterm rupture of membranes in three pregnancies, and the occurrence of preterm birth. Mean gestational age was 35.3 weeks (S.D. 2.4 weeks), and preterm birth was found in 73% of the children, while all children were born before or in the 38th week of gestation. Birth weight was normal for gestational age in all patients. The neonatal period was free from serious complications, apart from hemolytic disease in two patients. Preterm birth was found in 7% of the healthy siblings, reflecting the normal population. Prematurity and spasticity are intrinsic and concurrent parts of SLS, without causal relation. SLS should be considered in every neonate with congenital ichthyosis, especially if the child is born preterm. A possible explanation for preterm birth in SLS could be the defective inactivation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which recently has been demonstrated in patients with SLS.",M1
10449931,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: early diagnosis, dietary management and biochemical studies in two cases.BACKGROUND: Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with worldwide distribution. It consists of ichthyosis, spastic diplegia and mental retardation caused by an enzymatic defect in fatty alcohol oxidation. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of dietary management on clinical outcome and plasma/red blood cell fatty alcohol and plasmalogen concentrations. METHODS: To reduce fatty alcohol production, we reduced total fat intake to 30% of total intake of calories. To correct d 6 desaturase deficiency, we supplemented the diet with both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids to obtain a linoleic/linolenic acid ratio of 6 with low erucic acid rapeseed oil, plus high unsaturated fatty acids. We used gas liquid chromatography to assay blood cell membranes and plasma fatty alcohols/plasmalogens. RESULTS: Two SLS infants with proven fatty alcohol/NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency were studied. Good clinical results were obtained in one of the patients when dietary intervention was started in early infancy and correlated well with plasma fatty alcohol decrease. However, no clinical improvement was seen in the other patient who started later with low compliance. Acitretin therapy was necessary to control skin symptoms in this second patient. CONCLUSION: Dietary intervention using the combined approach described here may improve fatty alcohol metabolism in SLS. However, only very early intervention seems clinically beneficial.",M1

To define the molecular defects causing SLS, we performed mutation analysis of the FALDH gene in probands from 63 kindreds with SLS. Among these patients, 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, and 3 complex mutations-were found. All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations. Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells, but one mutation (798G--&gt;C [K266N]) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability. The splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites. Thirty-seven mutations were private, and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the FALDH gene. At least four of the common mutations (551C--&gt;T, 682C--&gt;T, 733G--&gt;A, and 798+1delG) were associated with multiple SNP haplotypes, suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient SLS genes that had undergone intragenic recombination. Our results demonstrate that SLS is caused by a strikingly heterogeneous group of mutations in the FALDH gene and provide a framework for understanding the genetic basis of SLS and the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests.",M1

We treated one SLS patient with zileuton during five weeks. During the treatment period we found decreased values of LTB4 and omega-OH-LTB4. The severity of the pruritus diminished, and favorable changes in the child's behavior were observed. The height of the prominent  lipid peak  of cerebral white matter (that is characteristically found on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in SLS patients) decreased during treatment, and increased again when treatment was stopped.

Widespread deposition of 2 different types of unusual substances, stained lightly or strongly with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) was most conspicuous in this case. The first type of them, lightly stained with PAS at room temperature, was widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS): the white matter of cerebrum and brainstem, subpial and subependymal glial layers, subpial space, perivascular space of small blood vessels, and their adjacent nervous tissue. The second type, strongly stained with PAS, small round or ellipsoid bodies, was found in the subpial, subependymal and perivascular glial layers. The first type of PAS-positive substances might be fatty alcohols or their metabolites, and the second type, some degraded products of lipids in astrocytic processes. Lipofuscin-like substances were accumulated in perivascular macrophages located around small blood vessels. Spheroid bodies (axonal swellings) were frequently observed in relay nuclei: lateral geniculate body (LGB), pontine nuclei, inferior olivary nuclei, posterior funicular nuclei, or cerebellar dentate nuclei. A lot of PAS-positive fine granules were contained in a spheroid body of LGB. Scarcity of myelinated nerve fibers was recognized in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter and the corticospinal tracts of spinal cord. Focal cortical dysgenesis, resembling that of unlayered polymicrogyria, was observed in bilateral insular cortices. Further histochemical studies are needed to explore the exact pathogenesis, but widespread deposition of PAS-positive substances in CNS may support the supposition that SLS is one of congenital errors of lipid metabolism.",M1
10227616,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: clinical and MRI/MRS findings in FALDH-deficient patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of clinical and MRI/1H MRS features of patients with fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) deficiency. BACKGROUND: The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) was originally defined as a clinical triad consisting of ichthyosis, spastic di- or tetralegia, and mental retardation, with autosomal recessive inheritance. By now, both the deficiency of the enzyme FALDH, and the genetic mutations on chromosome 17 responsible for this deficiency, have been identified. SLS, defined by fibroblast FALDH deficiency, seems to be a much broader syndrome. METHODS: The clinical findings of 11 FALDH-deficient patients of different ages and one patient with the characteristic SLS-like ichthyosis, but without FALDH deficiency, were evaluated in relation to their cerebral MRI, and to 1H MRS in six patients. RESULTS: The severity of neurologic symptoms showed considerable variation. Fundoscopic perifoveal glistening dots and the characteristic SLS-like ichthyosis were present in all patients. Serial MRI findings showed evidence of retarded myelination and a variable degree of dysmyelination. 1H MRS showed an accumulation of free lipids in the periventricular white matter, even before the stage of visible dysmyelination. CONCLUSIONS: The neurologic consequences of FALDH deficiency show considerable variation. The characteristic pattern of ichthyosis and retinal degeneration are seen consistently, yet they are not pathognomonic. MRI and 1H MRS findings suggest an accumulation of long-chain fatty alcohol intermediates, resulting in retarded myelination and dysmyelination.",M1

The release of aqueous-soluble radioactivity by the SLS cells was decreased to 25% of normal, consistent with an intact formation of pristanal but a deficiency of further oxidation. SLS cells also accumulated four-fold more radioactivity in N-alkyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine, which arises from incorporation of free aldehyde into phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Recombinant human FALDH expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells readily oxidized pristanal and cultured fibroblasts from SLS patients showed a severe deficiency in FALDH activity (13% of normal) when pristanal was used as substrate. Nevertheless, SLS patients did not accumulate phytanic acid in their plasma. We conclude that FALDH is involved in the oxidation of pristanal to pristanic acid and that this reaction is deficient in patients with SLS.",M1

Patients with SLS have deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme involved in long-chain fatty alcohol oxidation. The cDNA encoding FALDH has recently been cloned and several different mutations have been found in SLS patients.

The C943T mutation was only found in patients of northern European ancestry from Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. Haplotype analysis suggested that the patients carrying the C943T allele were distantly related. All four Swedish patients were homozygous for C943T, indicating that this mutation is probably the major cause of SLS in the inbred Swedish families. The mutation leads to the substitution of serine for the highly conserved proline 315 in the FALDH protein, and expression studies confirm that it destroys enzymatic activity. The mutation was readily detected with an MnlI restriction enzyme digestion test.

9295289,"Isolation of animal cell mutants defective in long-chain fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. Sensitivity to fatty aldehydes and Schiff's base modification of phospholipids: implications for Sj-ogren-Larsson syndrome.Using tritium suicide, we have isolated a variant of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO-K1, that is deficient in long-chain fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (FAO; EC 1.1.1.192). Specifically, it was the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase component that was affected. The enzymatic deficiency found in this mutant strain, designated FAA. K1A, was similar to that displayed by fibroblasts from patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>), an inheritable neurocutaneous disorder. Complementation analyses suggested that the deficiency in fatty alcohol oxidation in the FAA.K1A cells and the SLS fibroblasts is a result of lesions in homologous genes. The FAA.K1A cells were unable to convert long chain fatty aldehydes to the corresponding fatty acids. This resulted in a hypersensitivity of the FAA.K1A cells to the cytotoxic effects of long chain fatty aldehydes. The difference between the mutant and wild-type cells was most obvious when using fatty aldehydes between 14 and 20 carbons, with the greatest difference between wild-type and mutant cells found when using octadecanal. Fibroblasts from a patient with SLS also displayed the hypersensitivity phenotype when compared with FAldDH+ human fibroblasts. In both CHO and human FAldDH- cell lines, addition of long chain fatty aldehydes to the medium caused a dramatic increase in aldehyde-modified phosphatidylethanolamine, presumably through Schiff's base addition to the primary amine of the ethanolamine head group. When 25 microM hexadecanal was added to the growth medium, approximately 10% of the phosphatidylethanolamine was found in the fatty aldehyde-modified form in FAA.K1A, although this was not observed in wild-type cells. Modified phosphatidylethanolamine could be detected in FAldDH- cells even when exogenous fatty aldehydes were not added to the medium. We propose a possible role for fatty aldehydes, or other aldehydic species, in mediating some of the symptoms associated with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.",M1

In view of the function of ceramides in normal skin, this study aimed to assess their levels in patients with various types of hereditary ichthyosis, in which epidermal homeostasis is markedly abnormal. Stratum corneum samples were collected from 80 patients and 23 normal controls, and the intercellular and lipid envelope ceramides were analysed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The covalently bound ceramides (ceramides A and B) of the lipid envelope were present in all patients studied, and showed no significant differences from control samples. Total ceramides (ceramides 1-6) were decreased in bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma, which is presumably a secondary phenomenon similar to that seen in patients with atopic dermatitis. Patients with non-erythrodermic lamellar ichthyosis showed a marked decrease in levels of the important acylceramide, ceramide 1, whereas those with other types of autosomal recessive ichthyosis (limited lamellar ichthyosis and non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma) had mean levels similar to the controls. Ceramide 1 deficiency may therefore define a subgroup within the autosomal recessive ichthyoses. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) shows a deficiency of both acyl-ceramides (ceramides 1 and 6), which would seem likely to disrupt the normal skin barrier function. Furthermore, glucosylceramides (cerebrosides) are known to be deficient in the neural tissue of patients with SLS.

ALDH3, also has a high activity for fatty aldehyde oxidation, and is encoded by a gene in chromosome 17q11.2. Abnormality of the ALDH3 gene could also cause a similar syndrome. The examination of the ALDH3 locus of three additional SLS patients showed that two are heterozygous with C--&gt;G at nt 985 (Pro--&gt;Ala at protein position 329). However, the mutation was found to be common (frequency of the atypical allele is about 0.25) in normal subjects, and not related to SLS. Isoelectric focusing analysis indicated that ALDH3 is hardly expressed in normal as well as patients' fibroblast cells, while ALDH10 expressed in the normal cells is diminished in the three patients' cells. The level of ALDH10 mRNA is also low in the patients' cells. The examination of the ALDH10 locus revealed the existence of a 3 base deletion coupled with a 21 base insertion at intron 6/exon 7 junction in one patient. This abnormality is the same as that found in the patient previously reported by other investigators. One patient is associated with a 2 base deletion at nt 1297 and consequent premature chain termination at protein position 434.

Linkage of SLS to D17S783 and D17S805 has been reported in Swedish pedigrees, but since those data were generated from a single ethnic group originating from a common ancestor, there remained the question of whether this disease is genetically heterogeneous.

1939650,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. Deficient activity of the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase component of fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase in cultured fibroblasts.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an inherited disorder associated with impaired fatty alcohol oxidation due to deficient activity of fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (FAO). FAO is a complex enzyme which consists of two separate proteins that sequentially catalyze the oxidation of fatty alcohol to fatty aldehyde and fatty acid. To determine which enzymatic component of FAO was deficient in SLS, we assayed fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and fatty alcohol dehydrogenase in cultured fibroblasts from seven unrelated SLS patients. All SLS cells were selectively deficient in the FALDH component of FAO, and had normal activity of fatty alcohol dehydrogenase. The extent of FALDH deficiency in SLS cells depended on the aliphatic aldehyde used as substrate, ranging from 62% of mean normal activity using propionaldehyde as substrate to 8% of mean normal activity with octadecanal. FALDH activity in obligate SLS heterozygotes was partially decreased to 49 +/- 7% of mean normal activity using octadecanal as substrate. Differential centrifugation studies in fibroblasts indicated that this FALDH enzyme was largely particulate; soluble FALDH activity was normal in SLS cells. Intact SLS fibroblasts oxidized octadecanol to fatty acid at less than 10% of the normal rate, but oxidized free octadecanal normally, suggesting that the FALDH affected in SLS is chiefly involved in the oxidation of fatty alcohol to fatty acid. These results show that the primary enzymatic defect in SLS is the FALDH component of the FAO complex, which leads to deficient oxidation of fatty aldehyde derived from fatty alcohol.",M1

Three United States families, three Egyptian families, and one Israeli Arab family were investigated for linkage of the SLS gene to a region of chromosome 17. Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis with nine markers mapped the SLS gene to the same region of the genome as that reported in Swedish SLS pedigrees. Examination of recombinants by haplotype analysis showed that the gene lies in the region containing the markers D17S953, D17S805, D17S689, and D17S842. D17S805 is pericentromeric on 17p. Patients in two consanguineous Egyptian families were homozygous at the nine marker loci tested, and another patient from a third family was homozygous for eight of the nine, suggesting that within each of these families the region of chromosome 17 carrying the SLS gene is identical by descent. Linkage of the SLS gene to chromosome 17p in families of Arabic, mixed European, Native American, and Swedish descent provides evidence for a single SLS locus and should prove useful for diagnosis and carrier detection in worldwide cases.",M1

20123644,"Telethermography: an objective method for evaluating patch test reactions.Telethermography (TT) is a non-invasive imaging technique which can be used to evaluate the body's thermal gradients. It has recently been used as a diagnostic tool in many medical fields, especially in the study of the skin and other external organs. We assessed the applicability of TT in the objective evaluation of patch tests in allergic contact dermatitis, where clinical assessment is difficult, especially for atopic or brown-skinned individuals. In 34 individuals with a history of allergy to nickel sulphate (NiSO4), we applied a patch containing NiSO4 to the right side of the back and a patch containing 1% sodium-lauryl-sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) to the left side. As a control, we applied a patch containing an irritant (1% SLS) in a second group of 30 non-allergic individuals. A peculiar pattern was found for allergic reactions. This was characterized by a hot area that extended beyond the borders of the patch site and was oriented towards the nearest lymph-node(s), spreading as a hyperthermic line or lines. For the irritant test (SLS), the hot area was limited to the patch area, and the thermal gradients were lower. Thermography can be considered a useful complementary method for the evaluation of patch tests.",M2
20178700,"Reliability of self-assessed reading of skin tests: a possible approach in research and clinical practice?In the investigation and management of skin disease, various testing protocols are of importance. The extent to which clinical judgments and decisions on therapy are supported by the performance of such testing can be affected negatively by the lack of time and resources for the performance of tests. In the present study, the possibility of utilizing self-reporting by subjects is investigated. Determination of irritation threshold for sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) and minimal erythema dose for ultraviolet B were chosen as suitable self-reading protocols. Test reading by 26 subjects instructed in  present  or  absent  reporting of test reactions were compared to trained observer reading. Absolute agreement was found in 76.9 percent of the SLS reactions and in 85 percent of the UVB reactions. Weighted Kappa for the agreement between observations showed values of 0.76 for the SLS reactions and 0.83 for UVB reactions. We conclude that use of the protocols here studied, and other test protocols modified to accommodate a binomial assessment outcome ( +  or  - ), could well lead to an increase in the performance of skin testing. This could be a qualitative advantage for diagnosis and management of skin diseases. Additionally, population studies and even prevention initiatives could be facilitated.",M2
8217559,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. The ichthyosis is generalized in distribution, and histological features of the skin include hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, acanthosis, and a mildly thickened granular layer. Electron microscopy shows lamellar membranous inclusions in the granular and cornified cells. SLS patients have impaired fatty alcohol oxidation caused by deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, a component of the fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase complex. This enzymatic defect provides a reliable means for diagnosing SLS patients and unaffected SLS carriers. Prenatal diagnosis of SLS can be accomplished by enzymatic studies of amniocytes and cultured chorionic villi cells, or by histological examination of a fetal skin biopsy. Although still unproven, fatty alcohol accumulation in patients is thought to be responsible for the cutaneous symptoms.",M1
1583866,"Carrier detection for Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with reduced activity of the fatty alcohol: NAD+ oxidoreductase complex (FAO). Recent studies indicate that SLS patients are specifically deficient in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) component of FAO. To investigate the possibility of carrier detection for SLS, FAO and FALDH activities were measured in cultured skin fibroblasts from normal controls, obligate SLS heterozygotes, and SLS homozygotes using the 18-carbon substrates octadecanol and octadecanal. Three of 11 heterozygotes for SLS had FAO activities that were within the normal range; the other 8 SLS heterozygotes had FAO activities below normal. In contrast, fibroblast FALDH activity was more effective than FAO in discriminating SLS heterozygotes from normal controls. FALDH activity (nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1) in normal controls was 8.54 +/- 1.16 (mean +/- SD; range 6.95-10.77; n = 12) and in SLS heterozygotes was 5.12 +/- 1.31 (range 3.28-6.96; n = 11), or 60 +/- 15% of mean normal activity. One SLS heterozygote had an FALDH activity within the lower range of normal; this heterozygote had an FAO activity below normal. None of the SLS heterozygotes had an FAO or FALDH activity that was in the range of that measured in SLS homozygotes. These results indicate that measurement of FAO and FALDH activities in cultured skin fibroblasts using 18-carbon substrates is useful for SLS carrier detection.",M1

20391115,"Surfactant effects on skin absorption of model organic chemicals: implications for dermal risk assessment studies.Occupational and environmental exposures to chemicals are major potential routes of exposure for direct skin toxicity and for systemic absorption. The majority of these exposures are to complex mixtures, yet most experimental studies to assess topical chemical absorption are conducted neat or in simple aqueous vehicles. A component of many industrial mixtures is surfactants that solubilize ingredients and stabilize mixtures of oily components when present in aqueous vehicles. The purpose of this series of experiments was to use two well-developed experimental techniques to assess how solution interactions present in a pure nonbiological in vitro system (membrane coated fibers, MCF) compare to those seen in a viable ex vivo biological preparation (isolated perfused porcine skin flap, IPPSF). Two widely encountered anionic surfactants, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), were studied in 10% solutions. The rank orders of absorption were: water: pentachlorophenol (PCP) &gt; 4-nitrophenol (PNP) &gt; parathion &gt; fenthion &gt; simazine &gt; propazine; SLS: PNP &gt; PCP &gt; parathion &gt; simazine &gt; fenthion &gt; propazine; and LAS: PNP &gt; PCP &gt; simazine &gt; parathion &gt; fenthion &gt; propazine. For all penetrants, absorption was greater in SLS compared to LAS mixtures, a finding consistent with smaller micelle sizes seen with SLS. For these low-water-solubility compounds, absorption was greater from aqueous solutions in nearly every case. The inert three-fiber MCF array predicted absorptive fluxes seen in the ex vivo IPPSF, suggesting lack of any biological effects of the surfactants on skin.",M2

METHODS: In vitro experiments consisted of a human corneal epithelial cell line incubated with HA-HMW, rinsed, and incubated with SLS. Cell viability, oxidative stress, chromatin condensation, caspase-3, -8, -9, and P2X7 cell death receptor activation, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 production were investigated. In vivo experiments consisted of 36 New Zealand white rabbits treated for 3 days, 3 times per day, with HA-HMW or phosphate-buffered salt solution. At day 4, eyes were treated with SLS. Clinical observation and in vivo confocal microscopy using the Rostock Cornea Module of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph-II were performed to evaluate and to compare SLS-induced toxicity between eyes treated with HA-HMW and eyes treated with phosphate-buffered salt solution. RESULTS: In vitro data indicate that exposure of human corneal epithelial cells to HA-HMW significantly decreased SLS-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation cytokine production. In vivo data indicate that SLS cornea injuries, characterized by damaged corneal epithelium, damaged anterior stroma, and inflammatory infiltrations, were attenuated with HA-HMW treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A good correlation was seen between in vitro and in vivo findings showing that HA-HMW decreases SLS-induced toxic effects and protects cornea.",M2
19619862,"Novel characteristics of sophorolipids, yeast glycolipid biosurfactants, as biodegradable low-foaming surfactants.Sophorolipids (<e>SLs</e>) are a family of glycolipid type biosurfactants, which are largely produced by the non-pathogenic yeast, Candida bombicola. In order to investigate the possibility of SLs for industrial use, here we examined the interfacial activities, cytotoxicity and biodegradability of SLs, and compared these properties with those of two lipopeptide type biosurfactants (surfactin and arthrofactin), sodium laurate (soap, SP) and four kinds of chemically synthesized surfactants including two block-copolymer nonionic surfactants (BPs), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (AE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It was indicated that SLs had extremely low-foaming properties and high detergency comparable with commercially available low-foaming BPs. These interfacial activities of SLs were maintained under 100 ppm water hardness. Cytotoxicity of SLs on human keratinocytes was the same as surfactin, which has already been commercialized as cosmetic material, but higher than BPs. Moreover, biodegradability of SLs using the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals (301C, Modified MITI Test) displayed that SLs can be classified as  readily  biodegradable chemicals, which are defined as chemicals that are degraded 60% within 28 days under specified test methods. We observed 61% degradation of SLs on the eighth day of cultivation. Our results indicate that SLs are low-foaming surfactants with high detergency, which also exhibit both low cytotoxicity and readily biodegradable properties.",M2

In this study, we investigated the usefulness of the addition of OEP (0, 1, 2 and 4%) or SLS (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/ml) to cat ejaculates before freezing and their concentrations. Among the OEP addition groups, the 1% OEP group showed higher sperm motility than the other groups. Among the SLS addition groups, the 3 mg/ml SLS group showed slightly higher sperm motility and viability than the other groups. Comparison between the 1% OEP and 3 mg/ml SLS addition groups suggested a higher percentage of sperm with an acrosome cap in the 1% OEP group. The other sperm properties did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. These results indicate that addition of 1% OEP or 3 mg/ml SLS is effective for freezing of cat ejaculated semen.",M2
19878242,"Semipermeable glove membranes--effects on skin barrier repair following <e>SLS</e> irritation.BACKGROUND: Transepidermal water flux is the regulatory signal for barrier regeneration. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the impact of glove membranes, which provide a partial barrier and different water loss rates, on barrier recovery after standardized irritation with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). METHODS: Twenty-five healthy volunteers were irritated for 24 hr with SLS 1%. Four test areas were marked on clinically normal skin on the upper back. Barrier repair under consecutive dressing with semipermeable membranes (GoreTex, Sympatex, an occlusive membrane (Meditrate Vinyl), and in an uncovered control area were evaluated by measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema (a*). RESULTS: Areas semipermeably covered showed an enhanced barrier recovery and a reduced inflammatory response compared to the area under occlusion and the control. During healing process, TEWL (P &lt; 0.01) and a* (P &lt; 0.001) values were significantly lower in areas semipermeably covered than in the vinyl covered area and in the control. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that semipermeable materials improve barrier recovery rates by providing an optimized water vapour gradient during the healing process. This underlines the unique benefit of semipermeable gloves in the prevention of occupational skin disease: (i) by minimizing glove-induced irritation and (ii) by enhancing barrier recovery through protective glove materials at the work place in cases of pre-existing minor irritant dermatitis.",M2

1772531,"Monoaminergic dysfunction in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.The anteroposterior distribution of monoamine and monoamine metabolite concentrations was determined in subcortical brain nuclei of two cases of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (<e>SLS</e>) and was compared to two control cases. The brains were divided into halves and sectioned coronally. For biochemical analyses, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus were dissected macroscopically. Monoamine and its metabolites were determined by reverse-phase liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The other hemisphere was studied neuropathologically. The SLS cases revealed cell loss in substantia nigra and putamen and a widespread white-matter destruction. Biochemically, most pronounced alterations were seen in the dopamine system in putamen with severely reduced concentrations of dopamine (DA; 14% of control values) and the catabolic metabolites 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT; 9% of control values) and homovanillic acid (HVA; 20% of control values). In substantia nigra and the other striatal regions studied, a general decrease of 3-MT and HVA concentrations was observed in the SLS subjects compared to the controls, although the decrease was less pronounced than in putamen. Generally, somewhat reduced noradrenaline and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) concentrations were seen in the SLS cases, whereas serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations were increased compared to the controls in most regions studied. These data suggest a specific monoaminergic dysfunction in patients with SLS. The severe decline in the dopaminergic system in putamen suggests that supplementation of dopamine agonists may ameliorate the symptoms of SLS patients.",M1

Sixteen subjects rinsed three times per day for 4 d with dentifrice slurries containing 5,000, 1,500, and 500 ppm F, while 12 subjects rinsed with water solutions containing 5,000, 1,500, 500, and 0 ppm F, and 1.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). Plaque was scored [using the Quigley &amp; Hein index (QHI)] after each 4-d period. Plaque samples for F analysis were collected. Significantly less plaque was scored for the dentifrice slurry containing 5,000 ppm F (buccal and all surfaces) and for 1.5% SLS (buccal surfaces). The differences in plaque scores between dentifrice containing 5,000 and 1,500 ppm F were 19% for all surfaces and 33% for buccal surfaces. The difference between the water solutions containing 1.5% SLS and 1,500 ppm F for buccal surfaces was 23%; the corresponding difference for 5,000 ppm F was 17%. The dentifrice slurry containing 5,000 ppm F accumulated 56% more F in plaque.

Saturated calcium hydroxide aqueous solution (CH), sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) and SLS associated with calcium hydroxide (HCT20) were diluted with sterile distilled water at 50%, 20%, 10% and 5% concentrations. Minimum essential medium (MEM) served as the control group. The cytotoxicity of the solutions was evaluated on L929 mouse fibroblast cell line, at 4 and 24 h of contact time by the 51Cr radiotracer method. Data were compared and statistical inferences were made with the chi-square test. In all analysis, significance level was set at 5%. CH and HCT20 showed toxicity at 50% concentration, while at concentrations lower than 50% these solutions showed cell tolerance. SLS was cytotoxic at all concentrations. In conclusion, the association of calcium hydroxide and SLS (HCT20) combines the beneficial properties of these solutions and was not harmful to the fibroblast cell line, seeming to be a suitable endodontic irrigating solution.",M2

The compliance of products with respect to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution test and comparison of the products with respect to drug release in different dissolution conditions is reported in the present paper. The different dissolution conditions studied include dissolution medium (1% <e>SLS</e> in purified water, 0.1 N HCl), volume (900 and 1,000 ml), rpm (50 rpm, 75 rpm). Studies indicated that all six products complied with USP dissolution criteria. However, the extent of influence of dissolution conditions on drug release was varied among the products. Distinct dissolution profiles were observed and there was no correlation with disintegration time in certain products. The in vitro dissolution experimentation helped in identifying the discriminatory dissolution conditions and also the formulations that were unaffected with change of dissolution variables. In summary, commercial preparations of carbamazepine vary widely in their dissolution behavior in multi dissolution run experimentation. Identifying this behavior of the products was essential as an in vitro tool for screening a good and a bad formulation.",M2
18459049,"Evaluation of <e>SLS</e>: APG mixed surfactant systems as carrier for solid dispersion.The present investigation aims at studying the effect of mixed surfactant system of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and alkyl polyglucosides (C(10)APG, C(12)APG and C(12/14)APG) on dissolution rate enhancement of poorly water soluble drug. Aceclofenac--a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent was used as a model drug as it has limited water solubility. The influence of the surfactant concentration in various blends on dissolution rate of Solid Dispersion (SD), prepared using solution method with ethanol as the solvent was studied and the advantage of mixed surfactant systems over the individual surfactants was illustrated by differences in the in-vitro dissolution profiles of SD. Physico chemical evaluation (critical micellar concentration, zeta potential and beta-parameter calculations) was carried out to study the mixed surfactant systems. Solid mixtures were characterized by Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); X-ray diffraction studies (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was seen that the dissolution rate of aceclofenac from SD increased with the increase in the APG proportion relative to SLS with the optimum ratio of 0.2 SLS:0.8 APG showing the best effect in all cases. Results obtained from physico-chemical evaluation (the decrease in the value of critical micelle concentration and higher negative value of beta-parameters) suggested the existence of synergism between surfactants blends. The observed results in the dissolution rate enhancement could be attributed to the drug--surfactant interactions as evident from FT-IR, SEM and XRD results.",M2
19467032,"The alkaline pH-adapted skin barrier is disrupted severely by <e>SLS</e>-induced irritation.The pH of the healthy skin is 5.5 and maintained by many regulatory mechanisms. The pH of the skin care product we use on a daily basis can have an influence on the skin properties. To investigate how the physical properties of skin change after the alkaline or acidic pH of the skin care products are applied on the skin for a long term, we adjusted the pH of the skin care products to 3, 5 and 8 (A, B, C), with glycolic acid and triethanolamine. For 5 weeks the skin care products were applied on 20 healthy subjects' ventral forearm and the skin physical properties were measured. After 5 weeks, skin responses to the external stress of 1% (w/v) SLS (sodium lauryl sulphate) irritation and erythema by UV were measured. Skin colour and skin UV response were not altered by the pH. However, on the C-applied site (pH 8) the transepidermal water loss of stratum corneum (SC) increased significantly, the water content increased and desquamation decreased, respectively, and the SLS significantly impaired the skin barrier in comparison with other sites. The alkaline skin care product impaired the skin barrier after repeated application over 5-week period and the skin barrier was disrupted severely by 1% SLS exposure because SC was already impaired by alkaline pH and sensitive to external stress. This suggests that the pH of daily skin care products is very important for skin barrier homeostasis.",M2
19366370,"Sodium lauryl sulphate alters the mRNA expression of lipid-metabolizing enzymes and PPAR signalling in normal human skin in vivo.Detergents irritate skin and affect skin barrier homeostasis. In this study, healthy skin was exposed to 1% sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) in water for 24 h. Biopsies were taken 6 h to 8 days post exposure. Lipid patterns were stained in situ and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine mRNA expression of enzymes synthesizing barrier lipids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and lipoxygenases. The lipid pattern was disorganized from 6 h to 3 days after SLS exposure. Concomitant changes in mRNA expression included: (i) reduction, followed by induction, of ceramide-generating beta-glucocerebrosidase, (ii) increase on day 1 of two other enzymes for ceramide biosynthesis and (iii) persistent reduction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-B, a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, was unaltered. Among putative regulators of barrier lipids synthesis, PPARalpha and PPARgamma exhibited reduced mRNA expression, while PPARbeta/delta and LXRbeta were unaltered. Epidermal lipoxygenase-3, which may generate PPARalpha agonists, exhibited reduced expression. In conclusion, SLS induces reorganization of lipids in the stratum corneum, which play a role in detergents' destruction of the barrier. The changes in mRNA expression of enzymes involved in synthesizing barrier lipids are probably important for the restoration of the barrier.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy women from Yaoundé, Cameroon. Two hundred sixty women were randomized into three gel arms: (a) gel alone, (b) gel plus SLS and (c) placebo gel. Thirty-seven sexually abstinent women applied gel intravaginally once a day for 14 days, while 75, 74 and 74 sexually active women applied gel intravaginally once, twice or three times daily for 14 days, respectively. RESULTS: Retention rate was high at 85% and 221 women applied the two products and the placebo for a total of 6005 times. Nugent score, H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli and vaginal pH were stable throughout the study and were not affected by the study products. Colposcopy showed neither genital ulceration nor mucosal lesions. No study product-related serious adverse events were reported. The majority of reported adverse events were mild or moderate and largely similar in all 3 arms. Satisfaction questionnaire showed that the gel formulations and applicator were generally comfortable and acceptable. CONCLUSION: The Invisible Condom formulations and applicator were found to be comfortable, well tolerated and acceptable when applied intravaginally once, twice or thrice daily for 14 days. Thus, expanded safety evaluation is warranted.",M2
19811497,"Stratum corneum integrity as a predictor for peristomal skin problems in ostomates.BACKGROUND: Peristomal skin problems are common, most often the result is disruption of the skin barrier and this may account for more than one in three visits to ostomy nurses. Therefore a specific assessment of individual risk factors relating to the skin barrier function would be of great interest. METHODS: Skin barrier integrity in ostomy patients with peristomal skin problems (PSP) was compared with that of ostomy patients with normal skin (controls) using transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Mechanical barrier disruption was determined by a tape stripping test and chemical barrier disruption [sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) 0.25%]. RESULTS: Patients and controls had a highly significant increase in TEWL value in the peristomal area compared with nonperistomal contralateral abdominal skin (P &lt; 0.0001 for both groups). The skin barrier of normal-looking contralateral skin of ostomates was found to be borderline impaired in patients with PSP compared with those without. A linear association was seen between the number of tape strips removed and TEWL for both cases and controls. Tape stripping suggested that patients with PSP had less resilient skin (P = 0.002). A significant difference in TEWL value between cases and controls was also seen for the SLS patch test on the dorsal skin (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Successive tape stripping, a situation analogous to the normal use of a pouching system, caused a higher degree of barrier damage more rapidly in patients with PSP, indicating an impaired mechanical quality of the barrier. The SLS exposure test suggested a generally increased susceptibility to irritant dermatitis as assessed by TEWL. Our findings suggest tape stripping and SLS testing may have a role as predictive tests to identify patients at risk of PSP.",M2
18548750,"Resonance light-scattering enhancement effect of the protein-Y3+-TTA-<e>SLS</e> system and its analytical application.In this paper, a sensitive resonance light scattering (RLS) method for the determination of protein is reported. In the Tris-HCl (pH 7.50) buffer, protein enhanced the RLS intensity of the Y(3+)-2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA)-sodium dodecyl sulphate (SLS) system. The enhanced RLS intensities were in proportion to the concentrations of proteins in the range 8.0 x 10(-9)-1.0 x 10(-5) g/mL for BSA, 1.0 x 10(-8)-1.0 x 10(-5) g/mL for HSA and 1.0 x 10(-8)-1.0 x 10(-6 )g/mL for EA, and their detection limits were 5.0, 5.4 and 6.7 ng/mL, respectively. Actual samples were satisfactorily determined. The interaction mechanism was also studied.",M2
18468026,"Control of Listeria monocytogenes on vacuum-packaged frankfurters sprayed with lactic acid alone or in combination with sodium lauryl sulfate.U.S. regulations require that processors employ lethal or inhibitory antimicrobial alternatives in production of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products that support growth of Listeria monocytogenes and may be exposed to the processing environment after a lethality treatment. In this study, lactic acid (LA; 5%, vol/vol) and sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>; 0.5%, wt/vol) were evaluated individually or as a mixture (LASLS) for control of L. monocytogenes on frankfurters. Frankfurters were inoculated with a 10-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes, sprayed for 10 s (20 bar, 23 +/- 2 degrees C) with antimicrobials or distilled water (DW) before (LASLS or DW) or after (LA, SLS, LASLS, or DW) inoculation (4.8 +/- 0.1 log CFU/cm2), vacuum packaged, and stored at 4 degrees C for 90 days. Samples were analyzed for numbers of the pathogen (on PALCAM agar) and for total microbial counts (on tryptic soy agar with yeast extract) during storage. Spraying with DW, LA, or SLS after inoculation reduced numbers of L. monocytogenes by 1.3 +/- 0.2, 1.8 +/- 0.5, and 2.0 +/- 0.4 log CFU/cm2, respectively. The LASLS mixture applied before or after inoculation reduced pathogen populations by 1.8 +/- 0.4 and 2.8 +/- 0.2 log CFU/cm2, respectively. No further reduction by any treatment was observed during storage. The bacterial growth curves (fitted by the model of Baranyi and Roberts) indicated that the lag-phase duration of the bacterium on control samples (13.85 to 15.18 days) was extended by spraying with all solutions containing LA. For example, LA suppressed growth of L. monocytogenes for 39.14 to 41.01 days. Pathogen growth rates also were lower on frankfurters sprayed after inoculation with LA or LASLS compared to those sprayed with DW. Therefore, spraying frankfurters with a mixture of LA and SLS may be a useful antilisterial alternative treatment for ready-to-eat meat and poultry products.",M2
17938827,"The differences in human cumulative irritation responses to positive and negative irritant controls from three geographical locations.A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate whether studies from three geographically diverse locations have similar response profiles to the positive and negative controls in a standard 14-day cumulative irritation study (1). The positive irritant control (0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, <e>SLS</e>) and the negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, saline) data from seventeen 14-day cumulative irritation studies were reviewed. The studies were compiled from three locations representing dry/hot, humid/hot, and dry/cold environments (Scottsdale, Arizona; St. Petersburg, Florida; and Winnipeg, Manitoba, respectively). Irritation scores were generated by trained skin graders from a total of 442 subjects studied between 1999 and 2005. Cumulative irritation scores were reviewed and compared between study locations. The irritation scores for the positive and negative controls were not significantly different between locations. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) variation did not correlate significantly with overall irritation. However, the dryer climate (i.e., negative or low dew point) had a tendency to induce a higher overall irritation level for both positive and negative controls.",M2
17908195,"The barrier component and the driving force component of transepidermal water loss and their application to skin irritant tests.BACKGROUND/AIM: According to Fick's law of diffusion, the rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is determined by a barrier component and a driving force component. The objective of this study is to propose novel indicators for the assessment of skin irritation potential from chemicals using these components. METHODS: Before and after acetone/ether (AE), sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) and nicotinic acid methyl ester (NME) treatments, the apparent mass transfer coefficient of water, K, of the stratum corneum (SC) and the apparent water vapor pressure, P(d), at the interface between SC and epidermis were estimated as measures of the SC barrier and the driving force, respectively. RESULTS: After AE treatment, K showed marked increase and P(d) remained approximately constant. All participants reacted to NME with erythema and the laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) value peaked at around 30 min. While there was a change in P(d), which parallels with LDF changes, K showed little variation. Repeated SLS treatment induced a slight increase in P(d) besides an increase in K. In the meantime, all participants reacted with subtle erythema. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not only the SC barrier but also the driving force determines variations in the TEWL rates during skin irritant tests. Together, K and P(d) will provide us with invaluable information about skin condition.",M2
18239376,"Role of additives like polymers and surfactants in the crystallization of mebendazole.Crystallization in the presence of additives like surfactants and polymers is a relatively less explored area but is important for polymorphic screening of a compound during its developmental stage. Surfactants and polymers act by various mechanisms to influence either the growth or the nucleation phase, resulting in modification of either the polymorphic form or the crystal habit. The present study was aimed at understanding the crystallization behavior of the model drug mebendazole (MBZ) in the presence of an inert polymer polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and an anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). Crystals were generated by the antisolvent approach using the surfactant and polymer solutions in water as the antisolvents. Change in habit from needles to plates took place as a result of modification of the crystallization process in the presence of additive molecules. This was confirmed by quantification of these additives using specific analytical methods, which revealed their presence in small amounts in the final product (0.02, 0.15, and 0.24% w/w SLS in crystals generated using 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% SLS, respectively, and 0.94, and 1.24% w/w PVP K30 and PVP K90, respectively). Their presence in the crystals led to modification in the dissolution of the drug. SLS improved the extent of dissolution while PVP had a negative impact and led to reduction in the amount of MBZ released even below that of the pure drug. The study highlights the influence of polymeric and surfactant additives on the crystallization process leading to modified performance.",M2
18075203,"Effect of chronic topical exposure to low-dose noxious chemicals and stress on skin sensitivity in mice.It has been suggested that the recent increase in inflammatory diseases is related to an increase in environmental chemicals and psychiatric stress. To investigate the effect of chronic topical exposure to chemicals and isolation stress, low-dose formalin (a mild contact sensitizer and an irritant), 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB; a potent contact sensitizer) and sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>; an irritant) were applied to mouse ears at 7-d intervals under no-stress or stress conditions. Skin reactions (ear swelling) elicited by formalin and TNCB increased time dependently. At the chronic stage, a significant skin reaction peaking at 1 h after application was elicited on the formalin-treated sites, while a shift from a delayed-type hypersensitivity to an immediate-type response was observed on the TNCB-treated sites. At the formalin-treated sites, genes related to neurogenic inflammation, i.e., bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor, IL-6, and membrane metallo endopeptidase (NEP) mRNA were upregulated. In the TNCB-treated sites, marked upregulation of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-4, and IL-6 mRNA was observed in addition to B2 receptor mRNA. Pretreatment with HOE140, the B2 receptor antagonist suppressed these skin reactions. Increased skin sensitivity to an unrelated chemical, ethanol, and thermal stimuli were elicited in formalin and TNCB-treated mice. Cortisol levels in formalin-treated mice and IgE levels in TNCB-treated mice were elevated respectively. Stress markedly amplified the skin reactions and gene expression related to neurogenic inflammation. SLS did not induce any changes. It was concluded that chronic topical exposure to low-dose noxious chemicals and stress could easily induce skin sensitivity relating to the BK-B2 pathway and nociceptive sensitization reflecting neural sensitization.",M2
19055226,"Effects of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), present in dentifrice, on volatile sulphur compound (VSC) formation in morning bad breath.The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), present in a commercial dentifrice, on the formation of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) and tongue coating in a panel of periodontally healthy subjects. A two-step blinded, crossover, randomized study was carried out in 25 dental students with healthy periodontium; these were divided into two experimental groups: SLS (dentifrice with SLS) and WSLS (dentifrice without SLS). The volunteers received the designated dentifrice and a new toothbrush for a 3x/day brushing regimen for 2 periods of 30 days. A seven-day washout interval was used between the periods. The assessed parameters were: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), organoleptic breath (ORG), VSC levels by portable sulphide monitor before (H1) and after (H2) cleaning of the tongue, tongue coating wet weight (TC) and benzoyl-DL-arginine-naphthylamide (BANA) test from tongue coating samples. The intra-group analysis showed a decrease in the median of organoleptic scores from 3 to 2 after 30 days for the SLS group (p &lt; 0.05). The inter-group analysis showed lower values in ORG and H1 for the SLS group (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference between the amount of TC in SLS and WSLS groups. In the BANA test, the presence of SLS did not affect the BANA number of +/- results (p &gt; 0.05). These findings suggest that sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), present in dentifrice, appears to prevent VSC formation in morning bad breath regardless of the amount of tongue coating in periodontally healthy subjects.",M2
18717861,"Ceramide 1 and ceramide 3 act synergistically on skin hydration and the transepidermal water loss of sodium lauryl sulfate-irritated skin.BACKGROUND: Stratum corneum intercellular lipids, such as ceramides, play an important role in the regulation of skin water barrier homeostasis and water-holding capacity. Aim To evaluate the potential water retention capacity of control emulsion and three oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions containing ceramide 1, ceramide 3, or both. METHODS: Fifteen healthy Asian women (age, 20-30 years) with healthy skin, pretreated with sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), applied the tested emulsions twice daily over a period of 28 days. Skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values were measured on the indicated days with a Corneometer(R)825 and a TEWAMETER TM210, respectively. RESULTS: The maximum increase in skin humidity was reached after 4 weeks, with values of 21.9 +/- 1.8% and 8.9 +/- 0.9% for emulsion C and control emulsion, respectively. The maximum decrease in TEWL was also reached after 4 weeks, with values of 36.7 +/- 4.7% and 5.1 +/- 0.8% for the same emulsions. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that all the tested ceramide-containing emulsions improved skin barrier function when compared with untreated skin. There was some indication that ceramides 1 and 3 contained in emulsion C might exert a beneficial synergistic effect on skin biochemical properties, such as skin hydration and TEWL, and play a key role in the protection mechanism against SLS irritation.",M2
17980979,"Sodium lauryl sulfate impedes drug release from zinc-crosslinked alginate beads: switching from enteric coating release into biphasic profiles.The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) on ionotropically cross-linked alginate beads. Different levels of SLS were mixed with sodium alginate and chlorpheniramine maleate (as loaded model drug). The resulting viscous solutions were dropped onto aqueous solutions of zinc or calcium ions for ionotropic curing. The generated beads were assessed by their drug releasing profiles, infrared and differential scanning colorimetery (DSC) traits. SLS was found to exert profound concentration-dependent impacts on the characteristics of zinc-crosslinked alginate beads such that moderate modifications in the levels of SLS switched drug release from enteric coating-like behavior to a biphasic release modifiable to sustained-release by the addition of minute amounts of xanthan gum. Calcium cross-linking failed to reproduce the same behavior, probably due to the mainly ionic nature of calcium-carboxylate bonds compared to the coordinate character of their zinc-carboxylate counterparts. Apparently, moderate levels of SLS repel water penetration into the beads, and therefore minimize chlorpheniramine release. However, higher SLS levels seem to discourage polymeric cross-linking and therefore allow biphasic drug release.",M2
17944323,"Absorptive profile of chlorogenic acid in rats.The objective of this work was to systematically investigate the absorptive profile of chlorogenic acid (CGA) in rats and to increase its intestinal absorption using absorption enhancers. The rat in situ intestinal perfusion technique was used to examine absorptive rate and extent of CGA. In vitro enzymatic drug degradation study was carried out with rat intestinal washings. Various experimental conditions such as different concentrations, extraction purity, and different absorption enhancers such as sodium taurocholate (ST), sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), carbomer, borneol were examined. Absorption rate constants were determined by the plot of log remaining amount of drug in perfusate vs. time. During the in vitro enzymatic degradation study, no measurable degradation was observed. It was found that CGA could be poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. The absorptive rate of CGA is independent of the drug concentration. Absorption processes fit first order processes. Extraction of high purity is benefit to the absorption of CGA. Drug absorption extent could be increased via absorption enhancers except SLS. ST appeared to be more effective for enhancing the intestinal absorption of CGA than the other absorption enhancers. In vivo studies were carried out to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of solutions with and without ST. The order of increasing CGA absorption caused by the enhancers was ST &gt; carbomer &gt; borneol &gt; SLS.",M2
17627647,"Site variations in susceptibility to <e>SLS</e>.According to the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) guidelines on the sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) exposure test 'the flexor side of forearm skin with cubital fossa and wrist excluded is the preferred study site'. In this study we analysed the exact anatomic region within the suggested test area in respect to the outcome of the SLS exposure test. 3 test areas at the volar forearm were chosen: 'distal' with a 5-cm distance to the wrist, exact 'midvolar' and 'proximal' with a 5-cm distance to the cubital fossa. 25 healthy volunteers were irritated for 24 hr with 1% SLS. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements were taken before and 1 and 24 hr after removal of Finn Chambers((R)). Median baseline TEWL showed no significant differences in the 3 test sites. However, postexposure TEWL proximal was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher than midvolar and distal. The distal volar forearm showed the lowest TEWL 24 h after the irritation. The differences were in comparison to midvolar (P &lt; 0.01) and proximal (P &lt; 0.001) significant. The results show that it is essential to point out the exact position of the test area at the volar forearm in study reports and to randomize the irritation areas at the volar forearm if different treatments are to be compared.",M2
17656053,"A critical evaluation of fasted state simulating gastric fluid (FaSSGF) that contains sodium lauryl sulfate and proposal of a modified recipe.The aim of this work is to evaluate one of the most commonly used fasted state simulating gastric fluids (FaSSGFs), which contains sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) (FaSSGF(SLS)), and propose a more appropriate surfactant concentration. Surface tension studies clearly show that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of SLS in the relevant media (a media whose pH and sodium chloride concentration are representative of physiological conditions) is significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than 8.67 mM, which is the SLS concentration in FaSSGF(SLS). The CMC of SLS in the relevant media was determined to be 1.75 mM. Based on this a modified recipe is proposed in which the concentration of SLS is sufficient to achieve a surface tension similar to that in vivo without causing artificial micellar solubilization. Solubility, intrinsic dissolution, and GastroPlus modeling studies are presented to support and give rationale for the modified recipe. In addition, a comparison between the modified recipe and other FaSSGFs reported in the literature is made.",M2
17908190,"Cytokines at different stratum corneum levels in normal and sodium lauryl sulphate-irritated skin.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cytokines play an important role in inflammatory and repair processes occurring in the skin. The objectives of this study were to determine the amounts of cytokines and protein isolated by tape stripping in the different layers of the stratum corneum (SC), and to compare normal skin with skin exposed in vivo to the irritant sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). METHODS: In eight volunteers, we determined the amount of total and soluble protein and also interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) in pooled tape strips obtained from the upper, intermediate and lower parts of the SC. Three different types of tape were compared (Diamond , D-squame or Sentega tape). In a separate study, 20 volunteers were repeatedly exposed to 0.1% SLS over a 3-week period. The amounts of IL-1alpha, IL-1RA and IL-8 in strips obtained from the three different SC levels of SLS-exposed skin were compared with an unexposed site. RESULTS: For normal skin, the amounts of soluble protein and IL-1alpha were similar for the three tapes. Diamond tape showed the highest yield of total protein. The total protein yield per strip decreased to lower SC levels, whereas soluble protein and IL-1alpha normalized by soluble protein did not change across the SC. After SLS induced skin irritation, IL-1alpha decreased and IL-1RA and IL-8 increased at increasing depth into the SC. CONCLUSIONS: Tape stripping is a suitable method to determine SC cytokine concentrations in human skin. With this technique, it is possible to study changes in cytokine concentrations at different SC layers after skin irritation.",M2
17887176,"Evaluation of the porosity, the tortuosity, and the hindrance factor for the transdermal delivery of hydrophilic permeants in the context of the aqueous pore pathway hypothesis using dual-radiolabeled permeability experiments.The aqueous pore pathway hypothesis has been modified to include both transient and steady-state domains of diffusive transport to evaluate the porosity, the tortuosity, and the hindrance factor of the skin aqueous pore channels from an individual dual-radiolabeled permeability experiment. Using these theoretical and experimental methods, the porosity (epsilon), the tortuosity (tau), and the hindrance factor (H) of the skin aqueous pore channels were evaluated as a function of: (i) the radius of the selected model hydrophilic permeants (urea, mannitol, raffinose, and inulin), and (ii) the extent of skin perturbation present in untreated skin, skin pretreated at a low dose, and a high dose, with a simultaneous application of 20 kHz ultrasound and the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), and the dermis. The results of this investigation revealed that the tortuosity decreased, and only the hindrance factor for inulin was significantly less than 1, over the range of permeant radii examined. Furthermore, only the porosity increased over the range of skin perturbation examined (over 100-fold), suggesting that a surface-related phenomenon is primarily responsible for the observed enhancement in the transdermal permeability of hydrophilic permeants induced by the simultaneous application of ultrasound and SLS.",M2
18031501,"Anti-inflammatory effect of pimecrolimus in the sodium lauryl sulphate test.BACKGROUND: Pimecrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor used for the topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. We have shown previously that pimecrolimus cream is not effective on intact skin in the ultraviolet erythema test. OBJECTIVE: To test the anti-inflammatory effect of pimecrolimus cream after damage of the skin barrier by sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study. METHODS: SLS (3% v/v) was applied under occlusion on the back of 36 healthy volunteers for 24 h. Subsequently, the test areas were treated for 24 h with pimecrolimus cream, 1% hydrocortisone in a hydrophilic ointment, and the vehicle alone over three consecutive days. One control area remained untreated. The erythema index and the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) served as readout parameters to assess the SLS-induced skin irritation. RESULTS: Pimecrolimus cream and 1% hydrocortisone cream significantly reduced the SLS-induced erythema. The two test preparations did not have a significant effect on the TEWL. CONCLUSION: After damage to the skin barrier by SLS, pimecrolimus seems to penetrate into the skin as shown by a reduction of the irritation-induced erythma. These data further support the notion that pimecrolimus is selectively effective in the treatment of skin disorders with an impaired function of the epidermal barrier.",M2
18007579,"Skin barrier disruption by sodium lauryl sulfate-exposure alters the expressions of involucrin, transglutaminase 1, profilaggrin, and kallikreins during the repair phase in human skin in vivo.Detergents are skin irritants affecting keratinocytes. In this study, healthy volunteers were exposed to water (vehicle) and 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) under occlusive patch tests for 24 hours. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers and of enzymes involved in corneodesmosome degradation was examined in skin biopsies (n=8) during the repair phase (6 hours to 7 days postexposure) using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. It was found that the expression of involucrin was increased at 6 hours, but then rapidly normalized. The expression of transglutaminase 1 exhibited a twofold increase after 24 hours in the SLS-exposed skin. Profilaggrin was decreased after 6 hours. Later (4-7 days), the expression in SLS-exposed areas was &gt;50% above than in control areas. An increased and altered immunofluorescence pattern of involucrin, transglutaminase 1, and filaggrin was also found (n=4). At 6 hours post-SLS exposure, the mRNA expression of kallikrein-7 (KLK-7) and kallikrein-5 (KLK-5) was decreased by 50 and 75%, respectively, as compared with control and water-exposed areas. Thereafter, the expression pattern of KLK-7 and KLK-5 was normalized. Changes in protein expression of KLK-5 were also found. In conclusion, SLS-induced skin barrier defects induce altered mRNA expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers and enzymes degrading corneodesmosomes.",M2
17362230,"Metallothionein I and II gene knock-out mice exhibit reduced tolerance to 24-h sodium lauryl sulphate patch testing.BACKGROUND: Metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of proteins widely distributed in tissues regulating metal metabolism, scavenging free radicals, and taking part in immunological reactions. Knockout mice for MT genes I and II (MT(-/-)) exhibit reduced tolerance to ultraviolet B injury in vivo. Upregulation of MT proteins can be found at positive allergy patch-test sites; however, the role of MTs in skin irritation has not been investigated. AIM: To evaluate the role of MT genes in sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>)-induced skin irritation. SLS is a well-known model irritant in the study of experimental irritant contact dermatitis. METHODS: Skin irritation was induced in mice by applying closed-patch testing of 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% SLS in distilled water on the right dorsal skin of MT(-/-) mice for 24 h. Skin irritation was evaluated visually and by the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in SLS-irritated skin. Homozygous wild-type mice with intact MT genes (MT(+/+)) tested at the same time served as controls. RESULTS: MT(-/-) mice showed a much higher degree of skin inflammation than did MT(+/+) mice. Numbers of infiltrated inflammatory cells were 312.8 +/- 50.9 vs. 136.2 +/- 13.1 for 2.5%, 430.2 +/- 49.3 vs. 242.6 +/- 28.6 for 5%, 540.2 +/- 28.4 vs. 437.6 +/- 22.2 for 7.5%, and 690.6 +/- 31.0 vs. 559.0 +/- 37.8 for 10% SLS in MT(-/-) and MT(+/+) mice, respectively (P &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly suggest that the MTI and MTII genes may play an important protective role in SLS irritation. It would be valuable to study whether topical MTs can prevent or treat skin irritation.",M2
17118622,"Phenotypic alterations and cytokine production in THP-1 cells in response to allergens.In the induction phase of allergic contact hypersensitivity, dendritic cells (DCs), including Langerhans cells (LCs) present in epidermis, can trigger an efficient T cell response once they have matured in response to an allergen. Upon maturation, DCs have been shown to induce expression of several surface molecules and the up-regulation of cytokine production. We have previously shown that THP-1 cells, human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, can discriminate between allergens and irritants by measuring expression of surface markers, CD86 and CD54, following chemical exposure. At the same time, we have also reported that augmented expression of HLA and CD80, and production of IL-1beta were up-regulated in THP-1 cells when treated with an allergen, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). In the present study, we first evaluated whether THP-1 cells induced the phenotypic changes and the production of cytokines, which are observed in the process of DC maturation, when treated with two known allergens, DNCB and nickel sulfate (NiSO(4)), and one irritant (sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>)). Exposure to DNCB and NiSO(4) induced significant augmentation of CD40 and CD83 expression as well as CD86 and CD54. Also, TNF-alpha and IL-8 secretion were markedly induced by DNCB and NiSO(4) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, DNCB and NiSO(4) augmented CD1a expression and production of IL-6, respectively. On the contrary, SLS did not change any of these markers. We then evaluated a series of chemicals, including six known allergens (e.g., hydroquinone (HQ)) and two non-allergens (e.g., methyl paraben (MP)), in order to investigate the potential increase of CD86, CD54, CD40, and CD83 expression on THP-1 cells, and production of TNF-alpha and IL-8. Indeed, all tested allergens, except eugenol (EU), caused significant increased changes in at least four of the analyzed six markers, while non-allergens did not induce any changes. EU significantly augmented CD86, CD54 and CD40 expression. These results revealed that the wide variety of responses to allergens in THP-1 cells may emulate allergen-induced maturation processes of DCs. It is suggested that THP-1 cells, which could develop several DC-like properties, are suitable for identifying sensitizing potential of chemicals.",M2
17887123,"Evaluation of hydrophilic permeant transport parameters in the localized and non-localized transport regions of skin treated simultaneously with low-frequency ultrasound and sodium lauryl sulfate.The porosity (epsilon), the tortuosity (tau), and the hindrance factor (H) of the aqueous pore channels located in the localized transport regions (LTRs) and the non-LTRs formed in skin treated simultaneously with low-frequency ultrasound (US) and the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), were evaluated for the delivery of four hydrophilic permeants (urea, mannitol, raffinose, and inulin) by analyzing dual-radiolabeled diffusion masking experiments for three different idealized cases of the aqueous pore pathway hypothesis. When epsilon and tau were assumed to be independent of the permeant radius, H was found to be statistically larger in the LTRs than in the non-LTRs. When a distribution of pore radii was assumed to exist in the skin, no statistical differences in epsilon, tau, and H were observed due to the large variation in the pore radii distribution shape parameter (3 A to infinity). When infinitely large aqueous pores were assumed to exist in the skin, epsilon was found to be 3-8-fold greater in the LTRs than in the non-LTRs, while little difference was observed in the LTRs and in the non-LTRs for tau. This last result suggests that the efficacy of US/SLS treatment may be enhanced by increasing the porosity of the non-LTRs.",M2
17868216,"Effects of disinfectants and detergents on skin irritation.We investigated the biological response of regular human skin to alcohol-based disinfectants and detergents in a repetitive test design. Using non-invasive diagnostic tools such as transepidermal water loss, laser-Doppler flowmetry and corneometry, we quantified the irritative effects of a propanol-based hand disinfectant (Sterillium), its propanol mixture (2-propanol 45% w/w and 1-propanol 30% w/w), sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) 0.5% and distilled water. The substances were applied in a 2-D patch test in a repetitive occlusive test design to the back. Additionally, we performed a wash test on the forearms that was supposed to mimic the skin affection in the normal daily routine of health care workers. In this controlled half-side test design, we included the single application of the hand rub, SLS 0.5% and water as well as a tandem application of the same substances. Patch test and wash test showed similar results. The alcohol-based test preparations showed minimal irritation rather comparable to the application of water. However, the detergent SLS produced stronger barrier disruption, erythema and dryness than the alcohol-based preparations. There was no additional irritation at the combined use of SLS and disinfectants. By contrary, there was even a decrease in barrier disruption and erythema induced by the tandem application of SLS followed by alcohol-based disinfection compared with the use of SLS alone. These findings show a less irritant effect of alcohol-based disinfectants on the skin than detergents. Our study shows that there is no summation of irritating effects of a common detergent and propanol and that the combination of washing and disinfection has a rather protective aspect compared with washing alone.",M2
17804180,"Unexpected differences in dissolution behavior of tablets prepared from solid dispersions with a surfactant physically mixed or incorporated.In a previous study, it was shown that the incorporation of poorly soluble drugs (BCS class II) in sugar glasses could largely increase the drug's dissolution rate [van Drooge, D.J., Hinrichs, W.L.J., Frijlink, H.W., 2004 b. Anomalous dissolution behaviour of tablets prepared from sugar glass-based solid dispersions. J. Control. Release 97, 441-452]. However, the application of this technology had little effect when high drug loads or fast dissolving sugars were applied due to uncontrolled crystallization of the drug in the near vicinity of the dissolving tablet. To solve this problem a surfactant, sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), was incorporated in the sugar glass or physically mixed with it. Diazepam and fenofibrate were used as model drugs in this study. The dissolution behavior of tablets prepared from solid dispersions in which SLS was incorporated was strongly improved. Surprisingly, the dissolution rate of tablets prepared from physical mixtures of SLS and the solid dispersion was initially fast, but slowed down after about 10 min. The solid dispersions were characterized by DSC to explain this unexpected difference. These measurements revealed the existence of interaction of SLS with both the drug and the sugar in the solid dispersion when SLS was incorporated. It is hypothesized that due to this interaction, the dissolution of SLS was slowed down by which a high solubility of the drug in the near vicinity of the dissolving tablet is maintained during the whole dissolution process. Therefore, uncontrolled crystallization is effectively prevented.",M2

Incorporation of up to 5% w/w sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) in the coating membrane resulted in substantial increases in lag times in acidic and neutral media. The extent of drug release in acid was 100%, whereas in phosphate buffer, the extent of release was dependent on the level of SLS. Substituting SLS for various compounds was used to assess the functionality of the SLS molecule responsible for these behaviors. The ability to ion-pair with the polymer and the presence of a hydrophobic moiety were both important functionalities.",M2
17711529,"Ceramide analogue 14S24 selectively recovers perturbed human skin barrier.BACKGROUND: Topical ceramide application is an effective therapeutic approach in skin disorders with disturbed barrier function, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate ceramide analogue N-tetracosanoyl-(l)-serine tetradecyl ester (14S24) using a novel ex vivo model. METHODS: Freshly excised human skin was disrupted by lipid extraction, tape stripping and sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) treatment. Barrier perturbation was evaluated by the measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration and the penetration of model compound, theophylline (TH), assessed by microdialysis. The effect of topical 5% 14S24 was compared with a commercial formulation containing a skin lipid mixture (LR) and control formulation with no skin lipids (L). RESULTS: Both LR and 14S24 produced significant recovery of TEWL and TH penetration in extracted and tape-stripped skin with 14S24 being significantly more effective. In SLS-treated skin, 14S24 decreased TEWL but not TH penetration; LR was inactive. L improved skin hydration but not barrier characteristics. Weak correlation between TEWL and TH penetration was observed in extracted and tape-stripped skin but not in SLS-treated skin. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous microdialysis can serve as a useful tool for the evaluation of skin barrier recovery by topical formulations ex vivo whereas TEWL may not be an appropriate measure of skin barrier function in such studies. The excellent barrier repair activity of 14S24 could be beneficial in skin disorders with ceramide deficiency.",M2
17680662,"Modulation of ganciclovir intestinal absorption in presence of absorption enhancers.The purpose of this investigation was to study the influences of absorption enhancers in increasing oral bioavailability of Ganciclovir (GAN) by assessing the transepithelial permeation across cell monolayers in vitro and bioavailability in rats in vivo. The permeation of GAN across Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers in the absence/presence of dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DMbetaCD), chitosan hydrochloride (CH), sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), and their combinations was studied for a 2-h period. GAN was administered to rats in absence/presence of absorption enhancers and drug contents in plasma were estimated. We found that the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of GAN in absence of absorption enhancers (control) were 0.261 +/- 0.072 x 10(-6) and 0.486 +/- 0.063 x 10(-6) cm/s in Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers, respectively, whereas in the presence of DMbetaCD, CH, SLS, and their combinations, Papp of GAN increased by 5- to 25-fold and 7- to 33-fold as compared to control in Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers, respectively. However, in rats, the maximum enhancement in bioavailability of GAN during coadministration of these absorption enhancers was only fivefold compared to GAN control. To conclude, the absorption enhancers-DMbetaCD, CH, SLS, and their combinations demonstrated significant improvement in transepithelial permeation and bioavailability of GAN.",M2
16889066,"Increased dissolution and physical stability of micronized nifedipine particles encapsulated with a biocompatible polymer and surfactants in a wet ball milling process.Suspensions of nifedipine, a practically water-insoluble drug, were prepared in the presence of a biocompatible polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K value 17), and three surfactants, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>, anionic), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB, cationic), polysorbate 80 (Tween 80, nonionic), by wet milling in ceramic ball mills. Nifedipine powders encapsulated with PVP and the surfactants were recovered from the suspensions after milling and evaluated for changes in particle size, morphology, sedimentation rate in aqueous suspensions, crystal form, and dissolution. Particle size analysis indicated that milling of suspensions in solutions of PVP and surfactants is an efficient method for reducing the particle size of nifedipine to below 10 microm. Furthermore, DSC and XPS analysis indicated that during milling the nifedipine crystals were coated with the PVP or surfactants and that milling with PVP stabilized the nifedipine crystal form during milling while nifedipine was gradually amorphisized when milled in a quaternary nifedipine/PVP/SLS/CETAB system. The decrease in particle size caused a significant decrease in sedimentation rate and increased the dissolution rate of nifedipine in simulated gastric fluid when compared to milled nifedipine and powder mixtures of the drug and the excipients.",M2
16908426,"Towards a universal dissolution medium for carbamazepine.The aim of this study was to develop a dissolution medium for assessment of various carbamazepine (CBZ) formulations with different strengths. The design of a system inhibiting transformation of the anhydrous CBZ (CBZ A) to the dihydrate form (CBZ D), with minimum surface-active properties and suitable sink was investigated. The effect of pH, different concentrations of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and methyl cellulose (MC) on dissolution rate, solubility, dissolution solubility, and polymorphic transformation of CBZ was assessed. Solution-mediated transformation of CBZ A into CBZ D was monitored using optical microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Results showed that different strengths (100, 200, 400 mg) of the same CBZ tablet formulation exhibited different dissolution patterns, in 1% SLS (USP system). Such differences were reduced in 0.5% SLS solution which provided sufficient sink for up to 200 mg CBZ. It was also shown that solubility of CBZ A could not be detected in the media under study (water, SGF, SIF, and SLS solutions) due to its rapid transformation into CBZ D. The use of 3% PVP solution protected CBZ A from conversion for 75 min, while 0.01% MC completely inhibited the transformation up to 24 h. Therefore, a medium consisting of 0.5% SLS and 0.01% MC was selected. The medium provided: a) protection against transformation of CBZ A to CBZ D, b) increased solubility of CBZ A (204 mg % compared to 128 mg % of CBZ D in 0.5% SLS), c) suitable sink for up to 400 mg CBZ and d) overlapping dissolution profiles of various strengths of the same CBZ formulation. The suggested system may be a step in the way of solving CBZ dissolution problems that forced the USP to specify two similar dissolution tests with two different limits for conventional 200 mg CBZ tablets.",M2
17610648,"Evaluation of lotion formulations on irritation using the modified forearm-controlled application test method.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cold and allergy sufferers often develop irritation around the nostrils as a result of repeated and frequent rubbing of the skin site with facial tissues. This irritation is a combination of the inherent irritant properties of the tissue components (chemical irritation), and mechanical irritation from friction. Lotion-coated facial tissues are being developed to provide soothing, skin benefits, and to promote healing of this type of irritation. The objective of these studies was to evaluate the efficacy of different lotion formulations on facial tissues in preventing irritation, or aiding in the healing of irritation. METHODS: The modified forearm-controlled application test (Modified FCAT) was adapted as a means of quickly evaluating the relative skin benefits of various lotion formulations used to coat facial tissues. The test was conducted on the volar surface of the forearms of volunteer subjects. Test sites were pretreated with 24 h occlusive patches of sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) to induce mild or moderate skin irritation. This was followed by repeated wiping of the lotion-coated tissues. Irritation was evaluated using visual scoring for erythema and dryness. Lotion formulation options were compared in the model. Comparisons included assessments of the type of fatty alcohol in the formulation (stearyl and cetearyl alcohol), the presence of silicone and the base formulation (mineral oil, petrolatum of a proprietary formula). RESULTS: Differences in the degree of erythema and dryness were detected among various formulation options. No differences were found between formulations containing stearyl or cetearyl alcohol. Low levels of silicone produced benefits in one of two experiments. The proprietary base formula produced greater reductions in erythema following treatment of SLS-irritated skin compared with mineral oil and petrolatum bases. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that this modification of the FCAT can be used to compare various lotion formulations for skin benefits and healing properties, and to rank qualitatively the benefits of various formulation options.",M2
17610647,"Electrical impedance model for evaluation of skin irritation in rabbits and humans.BACKGROUND/AIM: The electrical impedance method has been used as a quantitative technique for evaluating changes in the skin during irritation within the invisible range. The purpose of this study was to apply an electrical model of skin to the interpretation of impedance data after the application of an irritant (<e>SLS</e>) in the skin of humans and rabbits. METHODS: Investigations were performed on 12 humans and 15 albino rabbits. Responses were evaluated by measuring electrical impedance before irritant exposure and 24 h after its removal and also by visual inspection. Using the raw impedance parameter, a novel index was developed and its value was correlated with visual scoring. RESULTS: The derived impedance index showed a significant correlation with visual scores and its value decreased (P&lt;0.05) after irritant removal even without macroscopic signs of irritation. CONCLUSION: The proposed electrical model of skin seems to be suitable for the detection and interpretation of changes in the impedance characteristics of skin induced by SLS in rabbits and humans.",M2
17576237,"Dual effects of sodium lauryl sulphate on human oral epithelial structure.Sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) is a common detergent known to cause irritation and inflammatory reactions in skin. SLS is also the most commonly used toothpaste detergent and has been related to intraoral adverse effects. However, its specific biological effects on the oral mucosa (OM) have not yet been identified. The objective of this study was to investigate the putative effects of SLS on human oral epithelium using a novel in vitro reconstructed three-dimensional cell culture model. Reconstructed human OM, generated from primary normal human oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts, was exposed to clinically relevant concentrations of SLS (range 0.015-1.5%). The cultured tissues were evaluated by histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry (Ki-67, epithelial (E)-cadherin, alpha6-, beta1-integrins, cleaved caspase-3) and the TUNEL method. Increased epithelial thickness, enhanced proliferation (Ki-67), a more pronounced expression of E-cadherin throughout all epithelial cell layers and single TUNEL-positive cells in the middle spinous cell layers were observed in cultures exposed to low concentrations (0.015%) of SLS. At exposure to higher SLS concentrations (&gt;or=0.15%), epithelial thickness, cell proliferation and E-cadherin expression gradually decreased and in the central areas of exposed regions, cells detached from each other and underwent cell death. In conclusion, clinically relevant concentrations of SLS have dual effects on reconstituted human OM; although occasional cell death within the epithelium was also observed, the increased epithelial thickness, proliferation and E-cadherin expression induced at lower concentrations might be associated with a protective mucosal response, whereas at higher concentrations a more destructive type of reaction predominated.",M2
17554365,"Dual-channel two-photon microscopy study of transdermal transport in skin treated with low-frequency ultrasound and a chemical enhancer.Visualization of transdermal permeant pathways is necessary to substantiate model-based conclusions drawn using permeability data. The aim of this investigation was to visualize the transdermal delivery of sulforhodamine B (SRB), a fluorescent hydrophilic permeant, and of rhodamine B hexyl ester (RBHE), a fluorescent hydrophobic permeant, using dual-channel two-photon microscopy (TPM) to better understand the transport pathways and the mechanisms of enhancement in skin treated with low-frequency ultrasound (US) and/or a chemical enhancer (sodium lauryl sulfate--<e>SLS</e>) relative to untreated skin (the control). The results demonstrate that (1) both SRB and RBHE penetrate beyond the stratum corneum and into the viable epidermis only in discrete regions (localized transport regions--LTRs) of US treated and of US/SLS-treated skin, (2) a chemical enhancer is required in the coupling medium during US treatment to obtain two significant levels of increased penetration of SRB and RBHE in US-treated skin relative to untreated skin, and (3) transcellular pathways are present in the LTRs of US treated and of US/SLS-treated skin for SRB and RBHE, and in SLS-treated skin for SRB. In summary, the skin is greatly perturbed in the LTRs of US treated and US/SLS-treated skin with chemical enhancers playing a significant role in US-mediated transdermal drug delivery.",M2
17464745,"Moisturizing lotions can increase transdermal absorption of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxacetic acid across hairless mouse skin.Moisturizing lotions can be an effective treatment for occupationally induced dry skin. These compounds are designed to be hygroscopic and retain water to keep the stratum corneum hydrated, while at the same time enhancing the horny layer to prevent increases in transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Skin hydration levels, however, are known to influence barrier properties. The purpose of this work was to compare skin moisture levels induced by four commercially available moisturizing lotions with their capacity as transdermal penetration enhancers using the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as a model chemical. Further, the effect of moisturizing the skin after washing with sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) on transdermal absorption was determined. Skin moisture levels were also measured noninvasively and were correlated to penetration enhancement. Hairless mouse skin was pretreated with commercially available moisturizing lotions either with or without SLS washing and in vitro permeability studies were performed with the herbicide 2,4-D. The data demonstrate that pretreatment with three of the four lotions tested increased the transdermal absorption of 2,4-D as evidenced by cumulative penetration or faster lag times (p &lt; 0.05). Skin moisture levels correlated with the penetration enhancement capabilities of the lotion. Washing the skin with 5% SDS increased the transdermal absorption of 2,4-D (p &lt; 0.05) and application of moisturizing lotions increased the absorption further. In summary moisturizing lotions may influence transdermal penetration of the skin, with the more effective moisturizers having a greater effect on 2,4-D absorption.",M2
17409512,"Pharmaceutical approach to HIV protease inhibitor atazanavir for bioavailability enhancement based on solid dispersion system.Atazanavir (ATV) is a low oral bioavailability (BA) compound and, clinically, is generally coadministrated with ritonavir (RTV), which boosts the oral BA of ATV by inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) via the same metabolic pathway. However, depending on pharmacokinetic interaction, RTV-boosted ATV has great potential for other comedication. In this study we demonstrated the pharmaceutical approach to BA improvement of ATV without RTV in rats, based on the solid dispersion system using sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) as a carrier and Gelucire 50/13 as an absorption enhancer. ATV solid dispersions in SLS were prepared by a conventional solvent method and, at ratios of ATV to SLS of 1 : 2 and 1 : 3, were demonstrated to form an amorphous state in powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and exhibited 2.26- and 2.36-fold improvement in a dissolution test in comparison to bulk ATV, respectively. After oral administration to rats, ATV solid dispersion in SLS at a ratio of 1 : 2 showed a 3.5-fold increase in BA compared with bulk ATV. Moreover, the addition of Gelucire 50/13 to ATV solid dispersion, at a total ratio of Gelucire 50/13, ATV and SLS 1 : 1 : 2 gave 7.0- and 4.7-fold increase in Cmax and BA compared with bulk ATV, respectively, when the relative BA to RTV-boosted ATV reached 93%. The results in this study proved that a pharmaceutical approach could improve the bioavailability of ATV without pharmacokinetic interaction with RTV.",M2
16701971,"Novel design of osmotic chitosan capsules characterized by asymmetric membrane structure for in situ formation of delivery orifice.In this study, chitosan capsules with asymmetric membrane to induce osmotic effects and in situ formation of the delivery orifice were optimally prepared and characterized. Chitosan capsules were formed on stainless steel mold pins by dipping the pins into a chitosan solution followed by forming asymmetric structure by dipping into a quenching solution containing tripolyphosphate (TPP) to cause an ionic cross-linking reaction between the outer layer of chitosan and TPP. Factors influencing the properties of the capsule membrane, such as the molecular weight of chitosan, the dipping solution and dipping time, and the quenching solution and time, were optimized to successfully produce osmotic chitosan capsules with asymmetric membrane using chitosans that possessed different viscosities. In situ formation of a delivery orifice on the asymmetric membrane of the chitosan capsule was proven by the observation of a jet stream of chlorophyll being released from the capsule. Drugs with different solubility were selected, and a linear correlation between drug solubility and the initial drug release rate calculated from the slope of the drug release profile was used to verify that the delivery orifices that were in situ formed on the asymmetric membrane of the chitosan capsules induced by osmotic effect was responsible for the drug release. Water permeability across the optimally produced asymmetric membrane of the capsule from chitosan of 500 cps (300-700 cps) quenched with TPP for 30 min (C500/TPP30) was determined to be 1.40 x 10(-6)cm(2)h(-1)atm(-1) at 37.0+/-0.5 degrees C. The encapsulation of poorly water-soluble drugs, felodipine (FE) and nifedipine (NF), in such an asymmetric chitosan capsule was capable of creating a sufficient osmotic effect to activate the release of the drug with the addition of <e>SLS</e> and HPMC. The multiple regression equations of maximal release percent at 24h for FE and NF confirmed that both sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) positively influenced this response factor, and the effect of SLS was greater than that of HPMC.",M2
16688383,"[Bovine udder skin (BUS): testing of skin compatibility and skin protection]New concepts of the horny layer as a metabolically active part of the epidermal permeability barrier elicited a re-evaluation of conventional mechanisms of occupational skin protection. Both skin protection products and noxae must penetrate the horny layer of the skin to be effective. The isolated perfused bovine udder skin (BUS) model reflects the natural penetration pattern; hence skin irritation, penetration and absorption can be investigated simultaneously. Using whole skin biopsies the degree of irritation in untreated (control), treated and pre-treated skin is measured by assessing the irritancy (PGE2-concentration) and cytotoxicity (MTT assay) after the exposure period of 0.5 h, 1.0 h and 5.0 h. Two types of skin protection studies were reported. One was a laboratory study using the water-soluble sodiumlaurylsulphate (10%, 15%) as noxa. The other study was initiated by a severely skin irritating water-soluble coolant (approx. 5%). This well documented case occurred in a metal working plant. In both studies different degrees of protective potential against the model noxae <e>SLS</e> and the coolant could be observed.",M2
17085897,"Effects of addition of sodium lauryl sulfate on frozen-thawed canine spermatozoa.The addition of Orvus ES paste (OEP) to extender may be essential for preparing frozen dog semen. The major ingredient of OEP is sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>). In this study, we compared the effect of SLS on frozen dog semen with that of OEP. There were no significant differences between the 2-mg/ml SLS group and OEP group concerning sperm motility, viability and the percentage of viable sperm with intact acrosomes after freeze-thawing. These results suggest that the effectiveness of frozen dog semen extender containing 2 mg/ml of SLS is similar effective to that demonstrated for OEP.",M2
17027244,"Effect of surfactant on dissolution of spherical particles in micellar systems.The influence of micelle-drug solubilization on the dissolution rate of monodisperse particles of benzocaine has been investigated. A model describing and predicting the initial dissolution rates of spherical particles was derived starting from the boundary layer theory. The dissolution rate of benzocaine spherical particles was determined in water and in solutions of sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) under static conditions. The derived model was applied to the experimental data. The diffusion coefficients and the aqueous diffusion layer values were estimated from the experimental results and the aforementioned model. The diffusion coefficients and the boundary layer thickness values were also obtained experimentally from the rotating disk method and were used to predict the initial dissolution rates. Excellent correlations were obtained between the experimental and the calculated values at low micellar concentrations. However, obvious deviation was observed at high micellar concentrations. The results obtained from this study suggest that it is possible to predict the initial dissolution rates of monodisperse particles in micellar systems.",M2
17026653,"Measurement of oedema in irritant-exposed skin by a dielectric technique.BACKGROUND: Easily applicable water-specific instruments measuring local oedema in skin are not available. The aim of this study is to demonstrate quantitative assessment of skin oedema with the dielectric technique by measuring increase of skin water content related to sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>)-induced irritant contact dermatitis. METHODS: Irritant skin reaction and resulting oedema were induced by an irritant patch test on volar forearms in 12 healthy volunteers with the application of 1% SLS for 6 h. After occlusion the volunteers were divided into two groups: the patch test site of group I (six volunteers) received no treatment other than a base cream for the skin reaction, while for group II (six volunteers) a strong corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) was applied on the irritant skin. During a follow-up of 72 h, erythema was scored visually, and irritant-induced oedema was measured with a novel water-specific instrument MoistureMeter-D. RESULTS: In the untreated irritant skin, a maximum increase of 45% in skin water content was found at 10 h postocclusion and water content was still elevated at 72 h. With these persons, the degree of oedema agreed well with the ultrasound-measured skin thickness (P=0.053). In the corticosteroid-treated skin, an increase of 8% in water content was measured during 72 h but there was no correlation between oedema and skin thickness. There was no correlation between erythema and oedema in untreated or corticosteroid-treated skin. CONCLUSION: The new instrument can easily be applied for noninvasive quantitative evaluation of local oedema and fluid retention in irritant-exposed skin.",M2
17026651,"Assessment of anti-inflammatory activity of Poria cocos in sodium lauryl sulphate-induced irritant contact dermatitis.OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of Poria cocos (PoCo) on experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) in a repeated sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) irritation model. METHODS: The anti-irritative effect of PoCo was evaluated with a visual score and quantified by non-invasive bioengineering methods, namely chromametry and transepidermal water loss. Three concentrations of PoCo in base cream DAC (amphiphilic emollient; German pharmacopoeia) were tested in a 4-day repetitive irritation test using SLS. RESULTS: A statistically significant anti-inflammatory activity was observed for PoCo by all three methods when applied in parallel to the induction period of ICD. Application of PoCo after induction of ICD once a day for 5 days, starting just at the end of 4 days, was without any effect. CONCLUSION: An anti-inflammatory efficacy of PoCo on the elicitation phase of the ICD induced by repeated SLS test could be observed and quantified by three independent, non-invasive biophysical assessment parameters. This effect can be explained by its influence on pro-inflammatory enzymes, namely phospholipase A2.",M2
16984262,"Increased permeability for polyethylene glycols through skin compromised by sodium lauryl sulphate.In this in vivo human study we assessed the influence of skin damage by sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) on percutaneous penetration of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different molecular weights (MW). Percutaneous penetration of PEGs was determined using tape stripping of the stratum corneum (SC). The forearm skin of volunteers was pretreated with 5% w/w SLS for 4 h, and 24 h later patches with PEGs were applied for 6 h. The penetration parameters were deduced by data regression to Fick's law for unsteady-state diffusion. The trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) increased after SLS treatment from 6.3 +/- 2.1 to 17.9 +/- 8.7 g/m(2)/h. The diffusion coefficient for all PEGs was increased in the SLS-damaged skin. The increase was smaller for higher MW. In addition, the partition coefficient of PEGs between SC and water was larger in the SLS-compromised skin and showed a tendency to increase with MW. The permeability coefficient decreased gradually with increasing MW of PEGs in both control and SLS-compromised skin. SLS caused a threefold increase in the permeability coefficient for all MWs ranging in control skin from 0.34 to 0.70 x 10(-5) cm/h and in the SLS-compromised skin from 1.20 to 2.09 x 10(-5) cm/h for MW of 590-282 Da. The results of this study show the deleterious effect of SLS on the skin barrier for hydrophilic PEGs. A defective skin barrier will facilitate absorption of other chemicals and local skin effects.",M2
16922019,"Rinsing with chlorhexidine gluconate solution after brushing and flossing teeth: a systematic review of effectiveness.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to discuss the concept of delaying the use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (CHX) until some time after the use of dentifrice. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Sources included 13 electronic databases, 7 international drug reference books, and the World Wide Web; references of all relevant papers; and further information requested from authors and organizations. Inclusion criteria were a predefined hierarchy of evidence. Study validity was assessed with checklists. Two reviewers independently screened sources, extracted data, and assessed validity. RESULTS: CHX, a cation, interacts and forms salts of low solubility and antibacterial activity with anions, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) and sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP). CHX and MFP are not compatible in clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. A 30-minute interval between SLS and CHX rinsing gave a significantly reduced antiplaque effect of CHX, whereas after 2 hours the neutralizing effect of SLS disappeared. Rinsing with dentifrice slurry and CHX produced a significantly increased plaque score compared to CHX and water. In regard to tooth staining by CHX mouthrinses, use of dentifrice before CHX showed a reduction in staining of 18%, whereas CHX followed by dentifrice showed a reduction in staining of about 79%. Literature relating to this interaction is limited; more controlled microbiologic and clinical studies are needed to certify the inaccuracy of this modality of administration. CONCLUSION: To optimize the antiplaque effect of CHX, it seems best that the interval between toothbrushing and rinsing with CHX be more than 30 minutes, cautiously close to 2 hours after brushing.",M2
16420540,"The hairless guinea-pig as a model for treatment of cumulative irritation in humans.BACKGROUND: The effect of six skin-care formulations (SCFs) on experimentally induced cumulative irritation was studied in hairless guinea-pigs (HLGPs) and in human volunteers (HVs). The formulations were a basic cream, a carbomer cream and four modifications of the carbomer cream, containing either 10% isopropyl palmitate (IPP cream), 10% glycerol (glycerol cream), 19.5% canola oil (canola oil cream) or 0.5% (-)-alpha-bisabolol (bisabolol cream). METHODS: In HLGP, irritant dermatitis was induced with 30 min daily exposure for 4 days to 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate aq. (<e>SLS</e>). In HVs, irritant dermatitis was induced with 10 min daily exposure for 5+4 days (no irritation on weekends) to 3% SLS aq. on the right and 30% nonanoic acid (NON) in n-propanol on the left volar forearm. Clinical scoring was performed daily; evaporimetry (total epidermal water loss (TEWL)), hydration and colorimetry were measured at baseline (day 0) in the middle and at the end of treatment. Treatments were applied twice daily. The basic cream and the IPP cream were excluded from testing in HLGP because they were known from previous studies to be irritant in HLGP, while all formulations were known to be equally and well tolerated locally in humans. RESULTS: All formulations worsened the skin irritation in HLGP: the glycerol cream the least, the canola oil cream the most, while the bisabolol cream and the carbomer cream were indistinguishable. In humans, the glycerol cream was better than 'No Treatment' after cumulative irritation with both SLS and NON. The basic cream was better tolerated in humans than was expected from previous testing in HLGPs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results from the studies in HLGPs and HVs are in agreement with regard to ranking of the SCFs. Further, the glycerol cream showed a positive treatment effect on both SLS- and NON-irritated skin in HVs.",M2
16316979,"Surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate enhances skin vaccination: molecular characterization via a novel technique using ultrafiltration capillaries and mass spectrometric proteomics.The skin is a highly accessible organ and thus provides an attractive immune environment for cost-effective, simple, and needle-free delivery of vaccines and immunomodulators. In this study, we pretreated mouse skin with an anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), for a short period of time (10 min) followed by epicutaneous vaccination with hen egg lysozyme antigen. We demonstrated for the first time that pretreatment of skin with surfactant SLS significantly enhances the production of antibody to hen egg lysozyme. Short term pretreatment with SLS disorganized the stratum corneum, extracted partial lamellar lipids, induced the maturation of Langerhans cells, and did not result in epidermis thickening. To reveal the mechanism underlying these changes, particularly at the molecular level, we used a novel proteomic technique using ultrafiltration capillaries and mass spectrometry to identify in vivo proteins/peptides secreted in the SLS-pretreated skin. Two secretory proteins, named as calcium-binding protein S100A9 and thymosin beta4, were identified by this novel technique. These two proteins thus may provide new insight into the enhancing effect of surfactants on skin vaccination.",M2
16806048,"Plaque biofilms: the effect of chemical environment on natural human plaque biofilm architecture.The architecture of microbial biofilms especially the outer regions have an important influence on the interaction between biofilm and local environment particularly on the flux of materials into and out of biofilm compartments and as a consequence, biofilm metabolic behaviour. In the case of dental plaque biofilms, architecture will determine access of nutrients including acidogenic substrates and therapeutic materials to the microbial biomass and to the underlying tooth surface. Manipulation of this architecture may offer a means of altering mass transfer into the whole biofilm and biomass and raises the possibility of improving access of therapeutics. Plaque biofilms formed in vivo on human enamel were subjected to a number of different chemical conditions while under observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy in reflection mode. In this way the outer 50-100 microm or so of the biofilms was examined. Density and distribution of biomass were recorded as degree of reflectance. The amount and density of biofilm biomass increased from the plaque saliva interface towards the interior. Plaque biofilms were robust and little affected by mechanical manipulation, high ionic strength or low pH (2.5). Detergent (<e>SLS</e>), however, often appeared to either remove biomass and/or dramatically reduce its density.",M2
16797892,"The effects of surfactants on the dissolution profiles of poorly water-soluble acidic drugs.The effects of types of surfactants on the solubilization and dissolution of poorly soluble acidic drugs were compared to identify the most suitable surfactant for conducting an acidic drug dissolution test. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) as an anionic surfactant, and polysorbate 80 as a non-ionic surfactant were used in the study. And, mefenamic acid, nimesulide, and ibuprofen were selected as model drugs. The dissolution rates of these acidic drugs were substantially enhanced in medium containing CTAB. Electrostatic interactions between acidic drugs and cationic surfactants were confirmed by measuring UV spectra of each drug. Solubility of drugs in various media and the partition coefficients of drugs into micelles were found to depend on drug characteristics. For acidic drugs, the ability of media containing a cationic surfactant to discriminate rates of dissolution of acidic drugs seemed to be greater than that of media containing other surfactant types.",M2
16792760,"Percutaneous penetration of sodium lauryl sulphate is increased in uninvolved skin of patients with atopic dermatitis compared with control subjects.BACKGROUND: Involved regions of the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have been shown to have higher transepidermal water loss (TEWL), indicating a compromised skin barrier. Whether uninvolved skin also has diminished barrier characteristics is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To study the penetration of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) into uninvolved skin of patients with AD compared with the skin of control subjects. METHODS: Percutaneous penetration was assessed using the tape stripping technique on the stratum corneum (SC). Twenty patients with AD and 20 healthy subjects were exposed to 1% SLS for 4 h on the mid-volar forearm. After the end of exposure the SC was removed by adhesive tape. The amount of SLS was determined in each consecutive strip. Fick's second law of diffusion was used to deduce the diffusivity and the partition coefficient of SLS between water and the SC. RESULTS: The SC thickness was similar in both groups; however, the TEWL was higher in patients with AD compared with that of the control group (mean+/-SD 8.4+/-4.3 and 6.3+/-2.0 g m-2 h-1, respectively). There was a correlation between SC thickness and TEWL in control subjects but no correlation was found in patients with AD. The diffusivity of SLS through uninvolved AD skin was higher compared with normal skin (mean+/-SD 12.7+/-5.8x10(-9) and 6.2+/-3.0x10(-9) cm-2 h-1, respectively), while the partition coefficient between SC and water was lower (mean+/-SD 137+/-64 and 196+/-107, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results show a different penetration profile of SLS into the SC of patients with AD compared with control subjects. This indicates that even noninvolved skin in patients with AD has altered barrier characteristics, emphasizing the importance of skin protection and prevention of skin contact with chemicals.",M2
16787454,"Stratum corneum cytokines and skin irritation response to sodium lauryl sulfate.Little is known about cytokines involved in chronic irritant contact dermatitis. Individual cytokine profiles might explain at least part of the differences in the individual response to irritation. Our objective was to investigate the relation between baseline stratum corneum (SC) cytokine levels and the skin response to a single and a repeated irritation test. This study also aimed to determine changes in SC cytokine levels after repeated irritation. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema were measured in 20 volunteers after single 24-hr exposure to 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), and during and after repeated exposure to 0.1% SLS over a 3-week period. SC cytokine levels were measured from an unexposed skin site and from the repeatedly exposed site. Interleukin (IL)-1alpha decreased by 30% after repeated exposure, while IL-1RA increased 10-fold and IL-8 increased fourfold. Baseline IL-1RA and IL-8 values were predictors of TEWL and erythema after single exposure (r = 0.55-0.61). 6 subjects showed barrier recovery during repeated exposure. Baseline IL-1RA and IL-8 levels are likely to be indicators of higher skin irritability after single exposure to SLS. Barrier repair in some of the subjects might explain the lack of agreement between the TEWL response after single and repeated irritation.",M2
16787451,"Irritants in combination with a synergistic or additive effect on the skin response: an overview of tandem irritation studies.Sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) has often been chosen as a model for irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) to study the effect of irritants in combination (1-14). Recently 'tandem', or sequential, exposures with SLS have been performed to study the mechanism of skin barrier impairment in ICD (1-6, 15). The assessment of reactions have been documented with visual scoring, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin colour reflectance measurements, skin blood flow; among which TEWL has been noted as the most sensitive value (16). The matched control groups were treated with either a single exposure to a single irritant or in tandem with the same irritant repeatedly. Synergistic and additive effects have been reported for various tandem pairs of irritants, however, the mechanism for both remains unclear. The results of tandem irritation studies were evaluated to define and investigate the responses produced and deduce a possible mechanism of action. Clinical ramifications, albeit complex, are discussed.",M2
16765542,"Co-solubilization of poorly soluble drugs by micellization and complexation.The use of combined approach of surfactants and cyclodextrins in solubilization of poorly soluble drugs has been described in literature. In this report, a mathematical model has been developed to provide the quantitative basis for this approach. First, by way of hypothetical examples and simulations, the influence of various interaction parameters on the phase solubility profile is presented. Additionally, the model results are compared with (a) results reported by Yang et al., with NSC-639829, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) and sulfobutyl-ether-beta-cyclodextrin ((SBE)(7M)-beta-CD) and (b) solubility of methylprednisolone, a model poorly soluble drug, in the presence of its water-soluble 'surfactant-like' prodrug, methylprednisolone 21-hemisuccinate, and (SBE)(7M)-beta-CD. The model shows good agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, theoretical simulations show that the combined solubility is less than the sum of the individual solubility values in cyclodextrins and surfactants. Based on the hypothetical case and the two examples, the factors affecting the phase solubility profile in mixed solutions of surfactants and cyclodextrins are presented. Finally, the limitations of the model to explain co-solubilization by surfactants and cyclodextrins are discussed.",M2
16634955,"Chlorhexidine mouthrinse in combination with an <e>SLS</e>-containing dentifrice and a dentifrice slurry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the plaque-inhibitory effect of a 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) rinse when preceded by ordinary toothbrushing with a 1.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)-containing dentifrice to the effect of the same rinse when used alone, or when preceded by rinsing with an SLS-containing slurry. METHODS: The study was an examiner blinded, randomized three-arm, parallel design. It used a 4-day plaque accumulation model to compare three different oral hygiene regimens, which were performed under supervision. One hundred and twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to one of each group. At the beginning of each test period, they received a thorough dental prophylaxis. The experiment was performed in one randomly assigned (upper or lower) jaw, called the study jaw. The opposite jaw, referred to as the dentifrice jaw, served only to introduce the influence of toothbrushing with a dentifrice on the anti-plaque efficacy of the CHX in the study jaw of the same mouth. At the end of the 4-day test period, plaque and gingival bleeding were scored in the study jaw. In all the regimens, the oral hygiene procedure was finalized by rinsing with a CHX 0.2% solution for 1 min. The study jaw was not brushed during the experiment. Regimen A (positive control) consisted of rinsing with CHX alone. In regimen B, rinsing with CHX was preceded by rinsing with an SLS-containing slurry, while in regimen C rinsing with CHX was preceded by toothbrushing with an SLS-containing dentifrice in the dentifrice jaw. No other oral hygiene measures were allowed. After 4 days of undisturbed plaque accumulation, the amount of plaque and level of gingival health were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall plaque index for regimens A, B and C was 1.17, 1.62, and 1.14, respectively. There was no significant difference in plaque accumulation between the CHX alone regimen (A) and the SLS-dentifrice-CHX regimen (C). Regimen B differed significantly from regimens A and C. The overall bleeding index for regimens A, B and C was 0.24, 0.18, and 0.20, respectively. There was no significant difference between the three regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the anti-plaque efficacy of a 0.2% CHX rinse was not reduced when preceded by everyday toothbrushing with a SLS-containing dentifrice. However, when preceded by rinsing with an SLS-containing slurry, the anti-plaque efficacy of a 0.2% CHX rinse was reduced.",M2
16584147,"Intragastric floating drug delivery system of cefuroxime axetil: in vitro evaluation.This investigation describes the development of an intragastric drug-delivery system for cefuroxime axetil. The 3(2) full factorial design was employed to evaluate contribution of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) K4M/HPMC K100 LV ratio (polymer blend) and sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) on drug release from HPMC matrices. Tablets were prepared using direct compression technique. Formulations were evaluated for in vitro buoyancy and drug release study using United States Pharmacopeia (USP) 24 paddle-type dissolution apparatus using 0.1N HCl as a dissolution medium. Multiple regression analysis was performed for factorial design batches to evaluate the response. All formulations had floating lag times below 2 minutes and constantly floated on dissolution medium for more than 8 hours. It was found that polymer blend and SLS significantly affect the time required for 50% of drug release, percentage drug release at 12 hours, release rate constant, and diffusion exponent (P &lt; .05). Also linear relationships were obtained between the amount of HPMC K100 LV and diffusion exponent as well as release rate constant. Kinetic treatment to dissolution profiles revealed drug release ranges from anomalous transport to case 1 transport, which was mainly dependent on both the independent variables.",M2
16540078,"Combined effects of NaF and <e>SLS</e> on acid- and polysaccharide-formation of biofilm and planktonic cells.Bacteria grow preferentially attached to surfaces embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix to form biofilms. In this mode of growth, bacteria often show reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combination of NaF and the detergent sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could result in additive effects on acid formation by planktonic and biofilm cells, as well as on extracellular polysaccharide formation. An additive inhibitory effect on Streptococcus mutans acid formation was observed, both in planktonic and biofilm cells. In dental biofilms, SLS alone and in combination with NaF reduced acid formation. Extracellular polysaccharide formation by S. mutans and saliva was reduced by SLS alone and in combination with NaF. In dentifrices and mouthrinse solutions, NaF and SLS are often present in combination. It remains to be determined whether an additive effect on acid formation may also occur in dental biofilms under different concentrations from those used in the present study, and whether the effects may be selective for certain bacterial species.",M2
16536807,"Variation in barrier impairment and inflammation of human skin as determined by sodium lauryl sulphate penetration rate.BACKGROUND: Skin irritability after a brief exposure to the model skin irritant, sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>), is known to vary considerably between individuals. A difference in the skin barrier to SLS may contribute to this variation. To date, no human in vivo data have been available on SLS penetration into the skin. OBJECTIVES: We studied whether the SLS penetration rate into the stratum corneum (SC) is related to impairment of the water barrier function and inflammation of the skin. METHODS: The penetration of SLS into the SC was assessed using a noninvasive tape-stripping procedure in 20 volunteers after a 4-h exposure to 1% SLS. Additionally, the effect of a 24-h exposure to 1% SLS on the skin water barrier function was assessed by measuring the transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The accompanying inflammation was quantified by measuring erythema. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD diffusivity of SLS (D) and the SLS permeability coefficient (Kp) were 1.4 +/- 0.6 x 10(-8) cm2 h(-1) and 1.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(-3) cm h(-1), respectively. A multiple regression analysis showed that the baseline TEWL, SC thickness and SLS penetration parameters K (SC/water partition coefficient) and D clearly influenced the increase in TEWL after the 24-h irritation test (explained variance: r2 = 0.80). Change in erythema was mainly influenced by SC thickness. CONCLUSIONS: We found that variation in the barrier impairment and inflammation of human skin depends on the SLS penetration rate, which was mainly determined by SC thickness.",M2
16469478,"Proteomic analysis of the response of EpiDerm cultures to sodium lauryl sulphate.The analysis of EpiDerm cultures treated with the known skin irritant sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) was performed using 2D-gel electrophoresis in order to understand the mechanism of action and thereby identify novel markers of skin irritation. A range of both broad and narrow pH gradient first-dimension gels were run (pH 4-7, 6-11, 4-5, 5-6 and 6-9) consistently followed by 12% SDS-PAGE in the second-dimension. Following treatment of EpiDerm with SLS, 67 proteins of interest were identified, of which 8 were selected as interesting: calmodulin-like skin protein, involucrin, epithelial cell marker protein, HS1, peroxiredoxin 1, serine protease inhibitor, KIAA0117 and ribosomal protein L17. Involucrin was confirmed as being up-regulated by both ELISA and Western blotting. The use of proteomics has identified a number of proteins which could be used as general markers for skin irritation and which may in particular be of value for the development of in vitro predictive models.",M2
16439077,"Effect of vehicles and enhancers on the topical delivery of cyclosporin A.Topical delivery of cyclosporin a (CysA) is of great interest for the treatment of autoimmune skin disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of various vehicles and enhancers on the topical delivery across rat skin. The topical (to the skin) delivery of CysA was evaluated in vitro using rat skin mounted in a Franz diffusion cell. CysA was analyzed by UV-HPLC. As vehicles, CysA vehicle containing 40% ethanol showed significantly enhanced deposition of CysA into the stratum corneum (SC) and deeper skin, as compared to other vehicles. The efficiency of the vehicles to improve the topical delivery of CysA was sequenced in the order of: 40% ethanol&gt;ethyl oleate&gt;Transcutol&gt;isopropyl myristate&gt;ethanol&gt;Labrasol&gt;propylene glycol&gt;Lauroglycol FCC. Next, we tested effect of pre-treatment with chemical enhancers on the penetration of CysA. The permeation-enhancer effect of enhancers was in the following order: 10% menthol approximately 0.05% <e>SLS</e>&gt;5% Azone&gt;5% NMP&gt;5% DEMO. Moreover, chemical enhancers shortened the lag time of the penetration of CysA into deeper skin. The present study suggests that the suspension of 40% ethanol containing 0.5% drug can more effectively enhance the topical delivery of CysA after skin pre-treatment with 10% menthol or 0.05% SLS.",M2
15834614,"Percutaneous penetration through slightly damaged skin.Guidelines for experimental studies of percutaneous penetration prescribe optimal barrier integrity of the skin. The barrier integrity of the skin exposed in occupational or household situations is, however, not always ideal, and skin problems are among the most dominant reasons for absence from work. We have therefore evaluated an experimental model for percutaneous penetration through slightly damaged skin. The influence of a slight damage to the skin was evaluated using five pesticides covering a wide range of solubilities. We used an experimental model with static diffusion cells mounted with human skin. A slight damage to the barrier integrity was induced by pre-treatment of the skin with sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) before pesticide exposure. The experimental model with 3 h pre-treatment with SLS (0.1% or 0.3%) assured a significant but controlled damage to the barrier integrity, a damage that remained unchanged for an experimental period of 48 h. Based on the percutaneous penetration of five pesticides, we conclude that a slightly damaged skin may significantly affect the rate, lag-time as well as total penetration of chemicals covering a wide range of solubilities. The percutaneous penetration of the most hydrophilic compounds will be those most affected. These findings should be considered when setting standards for dermal exposure to chemicals.",M2
15840102,"Sequential application of cold and sodium lauryl sulphate decreases irritation and barrier disruption in vivo in humans.BACKGROUND: Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is one of the most frequent types of occupational dermatitis. Different factors are involved in the development of contact dermatitis. In the food-processing industry, the combined exposure to different irritants may be involved in the development of ICD. Few data have been published regarding the irritant potential of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) in combination with cold. OBJECTIVES: The present study was intended to analyse whether cold exposure and low skin temperature influence the development of ICD. METHODS: Twenty (part I) and 12 (part II) healthy volunteers were exposed twice daily for 4 days to SLS alone, different low temperatures alone (4 degrees C six times for 90 s with an interval of 20 s or 15 degrees C for 10 min) or a combination of cold and SLS (19.6 microL SLS 1% cm(-2), part I; or 52.6 microL SLS 0.5% cm(-2), part II) using the tandem repetitive irritation test. Irritant cutaneous reactions were measured by noninvasive biophysical methods with transepidermal water loss as a parameter for permeability barrier function and skin colour reflectance together with visual scoring as parameters for inflammatory reactions. RESULTS: Cold alone caused no significant skin reaction compared with untreated control. Exposure to SLS alone and SLS together with cold (independent of the applied temperature of 4 or 15 degrees C) twice daily induced a clear irritant reaction and barrier disturbance. Reactions did not differ whether SLS was applied before or after cold. Furthermore, 'tandem application' of cold and SLS diminished the barrier disruption and irritant reaction compared with SLS alone. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the application of cold may have a protective effect on the development of ICD, at least in our short-term model.",M2
16307649,"Less skin irritation from alcohol-based disinfectant than from detergent used for hand disinfection.BACKGROUND: The benefit of alcohol-based disinfectant used on normal skin has been debated. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of repeated exposure to an alcohol-based disinfectant, a detergent and an alcohol-based disinfectant/detergent alternately for 10 days, including noninvasive measurements in the evaluation. Skin reactivity in irritated skin after a 4-week interval was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detergent, disinfectant and alternate disinfectant and detergent were applied twice daily every 10 min for 1 h to the ventral upper arms and forearms of 17 healthy volunteers. A control area was included. After 4 weeks an <e>SLS</e> patch was applied to each area. Irritant reactions were quantified with a visual score recording and measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin colour were performed on days 1, 5, 11, 38 and 40. RESULTS: On day 5 the detergent caused a higher visual score than either disinfectant applied alone or alternate disinfectant and detergent, P &lt; 0.05. On day 11 detergent and alternate disinfectant and detergent caused a higher score than disinfectant, P &lt; 0.05. An increased irritant response for detergent compared with disinfectant alone and alternate disinfectant and detergent was confirmed by TEWL evaluations on days 5 and 11, P &lt; 0.001, while no significant difference was found by colour measurement. After 4 weeks, when evaluated by colour measurement, significantly less response to the SLS patch was found on the disinfectant-treated area compared with the control area and detergent area, and a similar trend was found for TEWL, although it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Alcohol-based disinfectant caused less visible skin irritation and less skin barrier disruption than the use of detergent. The alternate use of detergent and disinfectant caused less irritation than the use of detergent, and a possible interaction between the two irritants was not indicated. After 4 weeks there was a tendency for decreased skin reactivity in the skin areas which had 4 weeks previously been exposed to disinfectant.",M2
16290495,"Preparation of microspheres by an emulsification-complexation method.Microspheres were prepared by complexation of a cationic polymer, polyquaternium-24, and an anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>). The cationic polymer solution was emulsified in dimethylsiloxane to give water in silicone emulsion (W/Si), and it was used as a template for the formation of microspheres. The emulsion was dispersed into the SLS solution. In this process, two kinds of droplets, silicone dropletes and microspheres composed of the cationic polymer and SLS, were formed, evidenced by X-ray energy dispersive spectra. The mean diameter of the microspheres was reduced from 105.7 to 64.8 mum as the stirring rate for W/Si preparation increased from 300 to 1000 rpm. It is believed that water droplets in W/Si emulsion, when exposed to SLS solution, could be solidified by the complexation of the cationic polymer and the anionic surfactant.",M2
16283906,"Long-term repetitive sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritation of the skin: an in vivo study.Skin may adapt to topical irritants through accommodation. This study focuses on long-term exposure to irritants and attempts to demonstrate accommodation. Sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) induced irritant contact dermatitis at 3 concentrations (0.025% to 0.075%). Distilled water, acetone and an empty chamber served as controls. Experimental compounds were applied to forearms of 7 healthy volunteers for 24 hr before replacing by a fresh chamber for 6 non-consecutive weeks over 103 days. Possible accommodation was quantified by visual scoring (erythema and dryness) and by bioengineering parameters: transepidermal water loss (TEWL), capacitance, chromametry and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Significant erythema, dryness, elevated TEWL, skin colour reflectance and LDF values occurred during the exposure periods. Upon repeat exposure, an immediate and augmented response in erythema, TEWL, skin colour reflectance and LDF developed. However, irritant skin changes were not sustained. Irritation parameters return to baseline after cessation of exposure. There was no evidence of sustained irritation or accommodation after the last exposure. Study findings do not document sustained accommodation or adaptive hyposensitivity after long-term repetitive irritant exposure under these test conditions. Alternative models should be developed to prove or disprove the accommodation hypothesis.",M2
16274956,"Variations in the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, markers of differentiation and lipid-metabolizing enzymes caused by sodium lauryl sulphate in cultured human keratinocytes.Detergents are well known irritants. Effects of the detergent sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) on cell toxicity using the XTT assay and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, markers of keratinocyte differentiation and enzymes synthesizing barrier lipids using real-time PCR were studied in cultured differentiated keratinocytes. After exposure for 24 h to SLS concentrations at 0.002% or above, toxic effects were observed. When a lower SLS concentration (0.00075%) was used the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators peaked around 4-8 h. The expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids and ceramides and markers of keratinocyte differentiation also increased but after 24 h. In cells exposed to 0.000125-0.0015% SLS, a concentration-dependent induction of the expression of inflammatory mediators was found after 4 h. Similar changes were found after 24 h for involucrin and enzymes involved in ceramide synthesis. The mRNA expression of HMG-CoA synthase and reductase, long-chain acyl-CoA synthase and transglutaminase also peaked after 24 h, but maximal induction was observed already at 0.00075% SLS. In conclusion, SLS induces an inflammatory response in keratinocytes and alters the mRNA expression of important barrier lipid enzymes and markers of keratinocyte differentiation, of possible importance for the irritant properties of SLS.",M2
16191847,"Induction of a hardening phenomenon by repeated application of <e>SLS</e>: analysis of lipid changes in the stratum corneum.Adaptation of the skin to repeated influence of exogenous irritants is called the hardening phenomenon. We investigated the stratum corneum lipid composition before and after induction of a hardening phenomenon. Irritant contact dermatitis was induced in 23 non-atopic volunteers by repeated occlusive application of 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) over 3 weeks. At 3, 6 and 9 weeks after irritation, the SLS responses of pre-irritated skin and normal skin were compared. The horny layer lipid composition (ceramides 1-7, cholesterol and free fatty acids) was assessed before irritation and 3, 6 and 9 weeks after irritation. During the first 2 weeks of irritation the transepidermal water loss increased continuously and seemed to decrease during the third week (effect of adaptation). The barrier function of pre-irritated sites was more stable to SLS challenge. Three weeks after irritation, there was a significant increase of ceramide 1 (p&lt;0.001). The only volunteer without hardening phenomenon showed no increase of ceramide 1. Ceramide 1 seems to play a key role as a protection mechanism against repeated irritation.",M2
16165244,"The nature of ultrasound-<e>SLS</e> synergism during enhanced transdermal transport.Ultrasound and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) exhibit a synergistic effect on transdermal transport, when applied simultaneously on the skin. The synergistic mechanism is not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that application of ultrasound simultaneously with SLS, results in enhanced mass transfer and improved penetration and dispersion of the surfactant. In this study we demonstrate that simultaneous application of ultrasound and SLS leads to modification of the pH profile of the stratum corneum. This pH modification within the stratum corneum's microenvironment, can affect both the structure of the lipid layers and the activity of SLS as a chemical enhancer due to its improved lipophilic solubility. The altered pH profile that results in improved SLS lipophilic solubility, together with improved SLS penetration and dispersion, can explain the synergistic enhancing effect of ultrasound and SLS on transdermal transport.",M2
16679819,"Sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritation in the human face: regional and age-related differences.The particular sensitivity of the human face to care products prompted us to study irritation induced by sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) in its various regions. We examined regional and age-related differences, correlating basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance to SLS irritation. SLS (2% aq.) was applied under occlusion for 1 h to the forehead, cheek, nose, nasolabial and perioral areas, chin, neck and forearm to two groups of subjects--one with 10 subjects with an average age of 25.2 +/- 4.7 years and another with 10 subjects with an average age of 73.7 +/- 3.9 years. TEWL was measured before and 1 h and 23 h after patch removal. Baseline stratum corneum hydration was also measured. Irritation was assessed by the changes in TEWL (deltaTEWL = TEWL after patch removal - basal TEWL) after corrections to the control. In the younger group, all areas of the face and the neck reacted to SLS, whereas the forearm did not. In the older group, the nose, perioral area and forearm did not react. In both age groups, some significant differences between the regions of the face were detected. The younger group showed higher changes in TEWL than the older group in all the areas studied, but only in the chin and nasolabial area were the differences statistically significant. Significant correlations were found between basal TEWL and deltaTEWL in 5 of the 7 areas which reacted to SLS. Baseline TEWL is one parameter that correlates with the susceptibility of the face to this irritant.",M2
16640448,"Study on the supramolecular multirecognition mechanism of beta-naphthol/beta-cyclodextrin/anionic surfactant in a tolnaftate hydrolysis system.Based on the fact that tolnaftate degrade to beta-naphthol sodium (RONa) at 5.00 mol/L NaOH solution and RO(-) was protonated to ROH after being acidified and adjusted to the pH 4.50 by acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer solution, we studied and discussed the mechanism of the supramolecular multirecognition interaction among the anionic surfactants sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), and beta-naphthol (ROH) by means of fluorescence spectrum, surface tension of the solution, infrared spectrograms, and (1)HNMR spectroscopy. The apparent formation constant of the ternary inclusion complex was determined to be (5.48 +/- 0.13) x 10(3) L(2)/mol(2). The thermodynamic parameters (DeltaG degrees, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS degrees ) for the formation of the inclusion complexes were obtained from the van't Hoff equation. It was indicated that the multiple and synergistic protection effect of SLS and beta-CD on the excited singlet state ROH played very important roles in the enhancement of the fluorescence of ROH. Results showed that, at room temperature, the naphthalene ring of ROH and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain of SLS were included into the cavity of beta-CD to form a ROH/SLS/beta-CD ternary inclusion complex with stoichiometry of 1:1:1, which provided effective protection for the excited state of ROH and increased the fluorescent intensity of ROH obviously.",M2
16029337,"Additive impairment of the barrier function by mechanical irritation, occlusion and sodium lauryl sulphate in vivo.BACKGROUND: The interaction between potential irritants in the workplace might be important because workers are not usually exposed to a single irritant, but to multiple potentially harmful substances. Physical irritant contact dermatitis caused by friction or mechanical abrasion is a common occupational dermatosis. Prolonged water exposure by occlusion is also common in the workplace. Several studies have revealed the negative effect of the common anionic detergent sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) on permeability barrier function. OBJECTIVES: To study the additive impairment of permeability barrier function by mechanical irritation combined with 0.5% SLS or prolonged water exposure by occlusion, as models of mild irritation. METHODS: The volar forearms of 20 healthy volunteers were exposed to mechanical irritation and occlusion with water or 0.5% SLS for four consecutive days in a combined tandem repeated irritation test (TRIT). Permeability barrier function was measured with a Tewameter TM 210. Irritation was assessed with a Chromameter CR 300 and a visual score. RESULTS: Barrier disruption in our model was rated as follows: occlusion with SLS and mechanical irritation &gt; occlusion with SLS &gt; occlusion with water and mechanical irritation &gt; mechanical irritation and occlusion with water &gt; occlusion with a glove and mechanical irritation &gt; mechanical irritation &gt; occlusion with water. Barrier disruption caused by occlusion or mechanical irritation was enhanced by the tandem application. The choice of irritant under occlusion, time of occlusion and order of tandem application all affected the degree of barrier disruption. Evaporimetry was able to detect early stages in the development of an irritant reaction before it became visible. Chromametry was not able to detect this early response. CONCLUSIONS: Physical irritants (friction, abrasive grains, occlusion) and detergents such as SLS represent a significant irritation risk and should be minimized, especially when acting together, as shown in our TRIT model.",M2
15948986,"Air flow at different temperatures increases sodium lauryl sulphate-induced barrier disruption and irritation in vivo.BACKGROUND: Combined exposure to dry climatic conditions and local heat sources together with detergents represents a common workplace situation. These conditions may support the induction of chronic barrier disruption leading subsequently to irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). OBJECTIVES: To test the irritant and barrier disrupting properties of air flow at different temperatures and velocities. METHODS: Using noninvasive biophysical measurements such as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (TM 210; Courage &amp; Khazaka, Cologne, Germany) we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to air flow at different temperatures (24 degrees C and 43 degrees C) in combination with sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) 0.5% on the skin of 20 healthy volunteers in a tandem repeated irritation test. Chromametry was used to control the accuracy of the SLS irritation model. RESULTS: In our study air flow alone did not lead to a significant increase in TEWL values. Sequential treatment with air flow and SLS led to an impairment of barrier function and irritation stronger than that produced by SLS alone. The two different air flow temperatures led to different skin temperatures but had no influence on permeability barrier function. CONCLUSIONS: Warm air flow has an additional effect on the SLS-induced barrier disruption in a tandem irritation test with sequential exposure to SLS/air flow. This combination is suspected to promote ICD in workplace and household situations, especially in short-term applications as tested in our model.",M2
15898995,"Allergic contact dermatitis from ophthalmic products: can pre-treatment with sodium lauryl sulfate increase patch test sensitivity?In patients suspected of allergic contact dermatitis because of topical ophthalmic medicaments, patch tests performed with patients' own products are often negative.

Pre-treatment of the skin with SLS 0.5% for 24 h was performed in the sites of patch tests with patients' own products in 15 selected patients. In patients previously negative to their own products tested with conventional patch tests, SLS pre-treatment showed 6 new relevant positive reactions and induced a stronger positive reaction in 1 patient. SLS pre-treatment could be proposed as an alternative promising method, which may increase sensitivity of patch tests with patients' own products.",M2
15885936,"Asymmetric membrane capsules for delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs by osmotic effects.A non-disintegrating polymeric capsule system, in which asymmetric membrane offers an improved osmotic effect, was used to deliver poorly water-soluble drugs in a control manner. The capsule wall membrane was made by a phase inversion process, in which asymmetric membrane was formed on stainless-steel mold pins by dipping the mold pins into a coating solution containing a polymeric material followed by dipping into a quench solution. This study evaluates the influence of coating formulation that was cellulose acetate (CA), ethylcellulose (EC), and plasticizer (glycerin and triethyl citrate). Results show capsule that made by CA with glycerin (formulation A), which appear in asymmetric structure and are able to release chlorpheniramine maleate (CM) in significant percentage. Two poorly water-soluble drugs of felodipine (FL) and nifedipine (NF) were selected as the model drug to demonstrate how the controlled release characteristics can be manipulated by the design of polymeric capsules with an asymmetric membrane and core formulations. Results show that sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) is able to promote the release of FL from polymeric capsules prepared with CA with asymmetrical membrane. The addition of solubilizer, including RH40, PVP K-17, and PEG 4000 could enhance the release of FL but with an extent not being related to its solubility. Based on these results, influence of core formulation variables, including the viscosity and added amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), the added amount of SLS, and drug loading were examined on the release of NF. It was found that HPMC of 50 cps was suitable to be a thickening agent and both added amount of HPMC and SLS showed a comparable and profoundly positive effect, whereas NF loading had no influence on the drug release percent and rate. There existed a synergistic interaction between HPMC and SLS on the release percent and rate.",M2

15840103,"Simultaneous sodium lauryl sulphate testing improves the diagnostic validity of allergic patch tests. Results from a prospective multicentre study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (Deutsche Kontaktallergie-Gruppe, DKG).BACKGROUND: There is evidence that a higher skin susceptibility may induce nonspecific erythematous or weak positive reactions to contact allergens in patch testing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether simultaneous application of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) along with diagnostic patch tests with contact allergens can provide information regarding skin irritability which may help to discriminate allergic from nonspecific irritant reactions to contact allergens. METHODS: Between July 2001 and June 2003, this prospective study collected patch test data of 5971 patients from 19 centres in Germany and Austria in the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK). In addition to contact allergens (standard series and eight known 'problematic' allergens with a low reaction index and a high positivity ratio: 1,3-diphenylguanidine, amerchol L-101, benzalkonium chloride, benzoyl peroxide, cocamidopropyl betaine, octyl gallate, phenyl mercuric acetate and propylene glycol), patches with SLS 0.5% and 0.25% aq. were applied. Reactions to the allergens and to SLS were analysed at the IVDK data centre. The association between an erythematous or positive reaction to a certain allergen and an irritant reaction to SLS was assessed with logistic regression analysis, at the same time controlling for the influence of age and sex. RESULTS: Of the 29 allergens of the standard series, 23 and 21 gave a higher percentage of nonspecific erythematous reactions in patients with an irritant reaction to 0.25% and 0.5% SLS, respectively, in comparison with SLS-negative patients. All eight 'problematic' allergens gave an increased percentage of nonspecific erythematous reactions. Similarly, 22 and 21 allergens of the standard series gave a higher percentage of positive allergic reactions in patients with an irritant reaction to 0.25% and 0.5% SLS, respectively, and seven of the eight 'problematic' allergens gave a higher percentage of positive allergic reactions (exception: octyl gallate). For most allergens, the markers of skin reaction (reaction index and positivity ratio) were worse in SLS-positive patients. Differences were more pronounced when testing with SLS 0.25% than with SLS 0.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Because there is a convincing association between skin irritability (evaluated by SLS test) and the degree of skin reaction to contact allergens, the SLS test may help in deciding whether a doubtful erythematous or weakly 'positive' skin reaction should be interpreted as allergic or irritant.",M2
15316186,"Effects of mouthrinses with triclosan, zinc ions, copolymer, and sodium lauryl sulphate combined with fluoride on acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.Bacteriological tests demonstrated a slight synergistic effect of triclosan and sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) on the growth of Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 in vitro. A single mouthrinse with SLS (17.4 mM) or SLS plus triclosan (3.5 mM) significantly decreased the number of salivary mutans streptococci in a group of 12 subjects up to 90 min after rinsing. The effect on plaque pH of a mouthrinse with either 12.0 mM NaF, NaF plus 10.0 mM zinc acetate, NaF plus 17.4 mM SLS, or NaF plus SLS plus 3.5 mM triclosan with or without the addition of zinc ions or 0.65% w/v of a polyvinylmethyl ether/maleic acid copolymer was investigated. The plaque pH responses to a 10% w/v sucrose mouthrinse were measured in 2-day-old plaque with microtouch pH electrodes in six groups of 10 subjects 90 min after a single mouthrinse with test solution. There was no significant difference in plaque pH between the various mouthrinses. In conclusion, triclosan enhanced the growth-inhibitory activity of SLS against oral streptococci in vitro but not against salivary mutans streptococci in vivo. Neither triclosan incorporated into a mouthrinse containing SLS plus fluoride, nor the addition of zinc ions or copolymer affected acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.",M2
15389675,"Experimental demonstration of the existence of highly permeable localized transport regions in low-frequency sonophoresis.Recent advances in low-frequency sonophoresis have focused on the existence of hypothesized localized transport regions (LTRs). However, there has been no actual experimental demonstration that the hypothesized LTRs are, in fact, localized regions of high permeability. Through a series of low-frequency sonophoresis experiments conducted with full-thickness pig skin, in the presence of the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>), in which we have separately measured the transport of calcein through the LTRs, which have areas ranging from 10 to 40 mm(2), and the surrounding regions of the skin (the non-LTRs) by means of a novel masking technique, we demonstrate that the calcein permeability through the LTRs is approximately 80-fold higher than the calcein permeability through the non-LTRs, suggesting that the LTRs are structurally perturbed to a greater extent than the non-LTRs from the exposure to the ultrasound/SLS system. In addition, we propose basic models to predict the total skin transdermal permeability from the transdermal permeabilities of the LTRs and the non-LTRs, and then compare the predictions to the experimental data obtained from the masking experiments. We also demonstrate that both the LTRs and the non-LTRs exhibit significant decreases in skin electrical resistivity relative to untreated skin ( approximately 5000-fold and approximately 170-fold, respectively), suggesting the existence of two levels of significant skin structural perturbation due to ultrasound exposure in the presence of SLS. Finally, an analysis of the porosity/tortuosity ratio (epsilon/tau) values suggests that trans-cellular transdermal transport pathways are present within the highly permeable, and highly structurally perturbed, LTRs.",M2
15767770,"Additive impairment of the barrier function and irritation by biogenic amines and sodium lauryl sulphate: a controlled in vivo tandem irritation study.Biogenic amines are potential irritants e.g. in fish-, meat-, milk- and egg-processing professions like cooks, butchers and bakers. The aim of this study was to test the irritative and barrier-disrupting properties of the biogenic amines ammonium hydroxide (AM), dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA). A repeated sequential irritation of 30 min twice per day was performed over a total of 4 days (tandem repeated irritation test) on the back of 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes with AM, DMA, TMA and sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). The epidermal barrier function was assessed with a Tewameter TM 210, stratum corneum surface pH was measured with a Skin-pH-Meter 900, inflammation was assessed with a Chromameter CR-300 on the a* axis for redness and a visual score was recorded. All tested biogenic amines (AM, DMA and TMA) induced a barrier disruption and a pH increase paralleled with a 1-day-delayed onset of inflammatory signs. These effects were further enhanced and accelerated by a sequential application of SLS together with the biogenic amines, and inflammation occurred earlier than with the single compounds. Acetic acid (AA) in contrast did only show mild barrier disruption and no significant inflammatory signs. Our system allowed a ranking of the different compounds in their irritative potential in the tandem irritation with SLS: SLS &gt; NaOH &gt; TMA &gt; AA &gt; AM &gt; DMA. The results are suggestive that in the food-processing industry the simultaneous contact with biogenic amines and harmful detergents like SLS should be minimized.",M2
15606650,"The MOAHLFA index of irritant sodium lauryl sulfate reactions: first results of a multicentre study on routine sodium lauryl sulfate patch testing.In a multicentre study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group, sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) 0.25% and 0.5% aq. has been added to routine allergen patch tests to assess its properties as a convenient diagnostic indicator of individual susceptibility to irritation at the time of patch testing. Previous studies indicated that irritant SLS reactivity may be related to individual factors such as age and sex. As these factors are, in turn, among the important predictors of contact allergy to many allergens, e.g. summarized in the 'MOAHLFA index', the impact of the MOAHLFA factors on irritant SLS patch test reactivity, and thus a potential for confounding, was assessed in the 5971 participating patients. As a result of 2 logistic regression analyses with an irritant reaction to 0.25% and 0.5% SLS, respectively, as outcome, male sex was identified as a relatively weak but significant risk factor (OR 1.38), while age 40 years or older was an even weaker risk factor (OR 1.22 and 1.15, respectively). Upon detailed analysis, no clear age gradient could, however, be identified. 1-day exposure time almost halved the odds of an irritant SLS reaction. In conclusion, this type of SLS patch test can be regarded as robust, indicating individual irritability relatively independent from the individual factors analysed here.",M2
15606647,"Can a positive photopatch test be elicited by subclinical irritancy or allergy plus suberythemal UV exposure?Photopatch test (PhPT) interpretation is difficult and clinical relevance is not always apparent. A positive PhPT may reflect photocontact allergy or phototoxicity. We hypothesized that it may also reflect the additive or synergistic effects of a suberythemal reaction to a contact irritant [e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>)] or allergen (e.g. nickel) and suberythemal UV exposure. 10 nickel allergic volunteers had duplicate SLS and nickel series applied on either side of the back for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. After removal, one side was irradiated with 5 J/cm(2) UVA or the dose below the minimal erythema dose for solar-simulated radiation (SSR). The minimal irritancy dose (MID) for SLS and the minimal allergenic dose (MAD) for nickel were determined visually and objectively by erythema meter. While photoaugmentation of subclinical contact allergy or irritancy occurred in some subjects, photosuppression occurred in roughly an equal number. UVA changed the nickel MAD at 48 h in 2 of 5 volunteers but not the SLS MID. SSR changed the nickel MAD in 4 of 5 and the SLS MID in 3 of 5. 2 subjects (none after UVA) showed erythema only in the irradiated set of patches, which could have been interpreted as a positive PhPT. We have demonstrated photoaugmentation and photosuppression of contact allergy and irritancy, which could result in false-positive or false-negative interpretation of PhPTs.",M2
15606645,"Irritant threshold and histological response of epidermis to irritant application.Individuals vary in their ability to react to irritants, which can be demonstrated for sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) using the irritant threshold (IT) test. We aimed to study whether the histological and immunohistochemical features of the skin following SLS exposure varied with subject's IT. 8 subjects were recruited. Their IT was measured. Biopsies were taken after 2 hr and 4 hr of occlusion with 20% SLS and control. The specimens were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and for Langerhans cells. At 4-hr, low-threshold subjects developed changes to a greater extent than high-threshold subjects. The relationship of histological reaction to IT could be related to a differential pro-inflammatory cytokine response in subjects. Low IT has been previously associated with a tumour necrosis factor alpha promoter region polymorphism.",M2
15588923,"Effect of vehicles and sodium lauryl sulphate on xenobiotic permeability and stratum corneum partitioning in porcine skin.Dermal contact with potentially toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals is a common hazard encountered in occupational, accidental spill and environmental contamination scenarios. Different solvents and chemical mixtures may influence dermal absorption. The effects of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) on the stratum corneum partitioning and permeability in porcine skin of 10 agricultural and industrial chemicals in water, ethanol and propylene glycol were investigated. The chemicals were phenol, p-nitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, methyl parathion, ethyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, simazine, atrazine and propazine. SLS decreased partitioning into stratum corneum from water for lipophilic compounds, decreased partitioning from propylene glycol and did not alter partitioning from ethanol. SLS effects on permeability were less consistent, but generally decreased permeability from water, increased permeability from ethanol and had an inconsistent effect on permeability from propylene glycol. It was concluded that, for the compounds tested, partitioning into the stratum corneum was determined by the relative solubility of the solute in the donor solvent and the stratum corneum lipids. Permeability, however, reflected the result of successive, complex processes and was not predictable from stratum corneum partitioning alone. Addition of SLS to solvents altered partitioning and absorption characteristics across a range of compounds, which indicates that partition coefficients or skin permeability from neat chemical exposure should be used with caution in risk assessment procedures for chemical mixtures.",M2
15544795,"The role of various surfactants on the release of salbutamol from suppositories.Salbutamol is a selective beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist with different pharmacological effects. In this research because of the simplicity of suppository application in elderly and its higher plasma concentration than tablets as well as its particular indication in premature labour, salbutamol suppositories were prepared. The suppositories were formulated containing 10 mg of the drug and Witepsol H15, the oleaginous soluble base using melting method. To optimize the release rate of drug, different surfactants namely, sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) as an ionic surfactant and Tween 80 as well as Arlacel 60 as non-ionic surfactants with different HLBs were chosen. The effect of surfactant concentration on the release rate of salbutamol from suppositories were also investigated. All prepared formulations fulfilled the specifications set down in British Pharmacopoeia. The results showed that Tween 80 (2%w/w) and SLS (0.75%w/w) caused an increase in dissolution rate of salbutamol from suppositories. As anionic surfactants, such as SLS, cause greater damage on mucosa than non-ionic surfactant, such as Tween 80, this study recommended that Tween 80 could be added in suppository formulation in order to increase the dissolution rate of salbutamol. It was also shown that the release rate of salbutamol altered linearly with the amount of Tween 80 in suppository formulations.",M2
16109631,"A new HPLC approach for the determination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components: the case of pseudoephedrine sulfate and loratadine in tablets.Effective isocratic separations of decongestants and antihistamines is a challenging analytical task due to wild differences in their lipohilicities (hydrophilic decongestants and hydrophobic antihistamines). In this paper a new approach for resolving such a problem is described taking pseudoephedrine sulfate and loratadine as an example. The chromatographic behavior of pseudoephedrine sulfate and loratadine on RP C18 and C8 columns were studied in presence and absence of sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>). The effect of combining two different types of stationary phases (cyano and C18 or C8) on the relative retention of the two compounds was investigated. In conclusion, it was found that the combination of a C18 column followed by a standard cyano column provides a stationary phase that separates both compounds effectively and within a reasonable time. This approach was compared to a literature method and demonstrated to have superior selectivity.",M2
16040403,"Fruit acids do not enhance sodium lauryl sulphate-induced cumulative irritant contact dermatitis in vivo.Combined exposure to different irritants in the workplace may lead to irritant contact dermatitis, which is the main type of occupational dermatitis among bakers and confectioners. Following previous work on  tandem irritation , a panel of healthy volunteers was exposed twice daily for 4 days to the organic fruit acids: citric, malic, and lactic acid, either alone or in tandem application with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>) in a repetitive irritation test. Irritant cutaneous reactions were quantified by visual scoring and non-invasive measurement of transepidermal water loss and skin colour reflectance. Twice daily application of either citric or malic acid alone did not induce a significant irritant reaction. Combined exposure to one of the fruit acids and SLS caused marked barrier disturbance, but the latter irritant effect was smaller than that obtained by combined exposure to SLS and water. Thus, combined exposure to the above-mentioned fruit acids and SLS did not enhance cumulative skin irritation.",M2
15293061,"The  strip  patch test: results of a multicentre study towards a standardization.BACKGROUND: The  strip  patch test (SPT) is a variant of patch testing which is used for substances with a poor percutaneous penetration. Penetration of the substances is enhanced by repeated applications of adhesive tape prior to their application to the skin. However, no guidelines exist for standardized performance of the SPT. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicentre study was to obtain a first practical approach towards a standardized SPT procedure. METHODS: Intact noninflamed skin of the upper back of 83 healthy volunteers was tape-stripped. For sequential strips, a 25-mm diameter 3M Blenderm surgical tape was vertically applied and gently pressed downward using the fingertips for about 2 s. The tape was removed in one quick movement at an angle of 45 degrees in the direction of adherence. Each strip was performed with a new piece of tape on exactly the same skin area. RESULTS. In each subject, we first determined the number of strips (A) until the skin surface started to glisten and calculated the median number of strips (A) in the sample (A=26 strips). We then ascertained the median number of strips (a) in the sample that was necessary to achieve a statistically significant and twofold increase in TEWL (a=11 strips), revealing a  critical  stratum corneum strip depth. The unknown number of strips (a) for each subject was finally calculated from the formula a/A=a/A, i.e. the individual number of strips (A) until the skin surface started to glisten was multiplied by a derived tape-specific correction factor (cf=a/A=11/26=0.4). The increase in percutaneous penetration in strip patch testing by performing  a  strips versus conventional patch testing was shown by scoring of clinical and subjective <e>SLS</e> irritant reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The present multicentre study outlines an experimentally derived approach for a uniform SPT procedure, which does not require the use of complex technical equipment. This first approach now requires validation by a study involving the application of allergens to obtain evidence of enhancement in the sensitivity of patch testing.",M2
15291829,"Intra-individual variation of irritant threshold and relationship to transepidermal water loss measurement of skin irritation.Irritant susceptibility studies have used either visual assessment or transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to determine subject response. We have developed a visual assessment method which determines subject irritant threshold. We examined the relationship between sodium lauryl sulfate (<e>SLS</e>) irritant threshold and TEWL measurements from normal skin and SLS patch tests. 19 subjects were recruited. The irritant threshold of each subject was measured and TEWL measurements made from the applied SLS patch tests. Individuals with a lower irritant threshold (easily irritated skin) had elevated TEWL levels compared to those with higher thresholds. The irritant threshold test had a low intraindividual variation. This study showed that the 2 methods grouped patients in a similar manner. The variation seen may reflect the different outcomes measured: irritant threshold visually assesses the skin inflammatory response while TEWL measures skin barrier modification.",M2
15541082,"Fruit acids and sodium hydroxide in the food industry and their combined effect with sodium lauryl sulphate: controlled in vivo tandem irritation study.BACKGROUND: Cutaneous exposure to a variety of irritants has been extensively studied in recent years. Nevertheless, knowledge of the induction of irritant dermatitis, especially by mild irritants at low doses and for a short duration of exposure, is still incomplete. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the irritant effects and barrier disruption properties of ascorbic acid (ASC), acetic acid (ACA) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), particularly in combination with an anionic detergent, sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). METHODS: In a tandem repeated irritation test, the irritants were applied for 30 min twice daily for 4 days to the skin of the mid-back of 19 healthy volunteers of both sexes. We used bioengineering techniques for measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin colour reflectance, as well as visual scoring. RESULTS: Repeated application of ASC and ACA caused a moderate increase in TEWL and erythema. The sequential application of ASC or ACA and SLS enhanced these effects. NaOH induced a strong reaction when applied both occlusively and nonocclusively as well as in combination with SLS, with an early onset of the inflammatory signs, leading to discontinuation of the application on the third day in most of the test fields. Notably, the irritant effect of NaOH was not as marked when applied sequentially with SLS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that concurrent application of an anionic detergent and a mild acidic irritant can lead to disruption of the barrier function which, although not additive, is still considerable. The combined application of SLS and mild acids does not prevent SLS-induced irritation. Furthermore, we showed that NaOH in low concentrations may also act as a potent irritant but that its effect is not enhanced by SLS. The necessity of adequate skin protection and reduction of contact with substances that are potentially barrier disruptive and irritant, e.g. in the food industry, is emphasized, not only when handling detergents, but also when processing food products.",M2
15500669,"Human scalp irritation compared to that of the arm and back.Large-scale data comparing reactions to surfactants between scalp and back and arm are lacking. The sensitivity of responses between scalp and back and arm were explored utilizing an open-application model for testing the potential irritancy of sodium lauryl sulphate (<e>SLS</e>). 10 bald male Caucasians (mean age 56 +/- 9 years) were enrolled. We conducted 5 successive washings: for each wash, the technician pipetted 1 ml of 20% SLS solution into a glass cylinder placed on the designated area with hand pressure that prevented the cylinder leaking. The test area was then rubbed with a Teflon Policeman scrubber for 1 min. Post scrubbing, the solution was absorbed dry with a plastic pipette and blotted by gently applying paper tissues. After a 5-min rest, the procedure was repeated for 4 more times for a total of 5 times. Skin-irritancy assessments by visual scoring and instrumental measurements were made at 30 min and 24 h thereafter and squamometry at the end of last washing. Results indicated that most param- eters revealed that the back was most sensitive to the SLS challenge. Thus, these data support the current standard skin-compatibility testing procedure, employing the back for potential irritation testing of hair care products.",M2
