20169397,"Non-caspase proteases: triggers or amplifiers of apoptosis?Caspases are the most important effectors of apoptosis, the major form of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in multicellular organisms. This is best reflected by the appearance of serious development defects in mice deficient for caspase-8, -9, and -3. Meanwhile, caspase-independent PCD, mediated by other proteases or signaling components has been described in numerous publications. Although we do not doubt that such cell death exists, we propose that it has evolved later during evolution and is most likely not designed to execute, but to amplify and speed-up caspase-dependent cell death. This review shall provide evidence for such a concept.",M1
20155628,"Induction of caspase-independent programmed cell death by vitamin E natural homologs and synthetic derivatives.Current observations in the literature suggest that vitamin E may be a suitable candidate for cancer chemotherapy. To investigate this further, we examined the ability of the vitamin E natural homologs [alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopherols (alpha-TOC, beta-TOC, gamma-TOC, delta-TOC) and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocotrienols (alpha-TT, beta-TT, gamma-TT, delta-TT)] and their corresponding succinate synthetic derivatives [alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopheryl succinates and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocotrienyl succinates (alpha-TS, beta-TS, gamma-TS, delta-TS)] to induce cell death in AR- (DU145 and PC3) and AR+ (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell lines. The most effective of all the natural homologs of vitamin E was determined to be delta-TT, whereas delta-TS was the most potent of all the natural and synthetic compounds of vitamin E examined. Both gamma-TT and delta-TT induced caspase activity selectively in AR+ LNCaP cells, suggesting a possible role for AR for the activation of caspase-dependent programmed cell death (CD-<e>PCD</e>). More important, however, gamma-TT, delta-TT, gamma-TS, and delta-TS activated dominant caspase-independent programmed cell death (CI-PCD) in all prostate cancer cell lines examined. Thus, vitamin E homologs and synthetic derivatives may find applications in the treatment of prostate tumors that are resistant to caspase-activating therapeutic agents.",M1
20122248,"Antimicrobial peptaibols, novel suppressors of tumor cells, targeted calcium-mediated apoptosis and autophagy in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world which is highly chemoresistant to currently available chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, novel therapeutic targets are needed to be sought for the successful treatment of HCC. Peptaibols, a family of peptides synthesized non-ribosomally by the Trichoderma species and other fungi, exhibit antibiotic activities against bacteria and fungi. Few studies recently showed that peptaibols exerted cytotoxicity toward human lung epithelial and breast carcinoma cells. However, the mechanism involved in peptaibol-induced cell death remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we showed that Trichokonin VI (TK VI), a peptaibol from Trichoderma pseudokoningii SMF2, induced growth inhibition of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. It did not obviously impair the viability of normal liver cells at lower concentration. Moreover, the suppression of cell viability resulted from the programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) with characteristics of apoptosis and autophagy. An influx of Ca2+ triggered the activation of mu-calpain and proceeded to the translocation of Bax to mitochondria and subsequent promotion of apoptosis. On the other hand, typically morphological characteristics consistent with autophagy were also observed by punctate distribution of MDC staining and the induction of LC3-II, including extensive autophagic vacuolization and enclosure of cell organelles by these autophagosomes. More significantly, specific depletion of Bak expression by small RNA interfering (siRNA) could partly attenuate TK VI-induced autophagy. However, siRNA against Bax led to increased autophagy. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings showed for the first time that peptaibols were novel regulators involved in both apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting that the class of peptaibols might serve as potential suppressors of tumor cells.",M1
20121450,"Viral-induced systemic necrosis in plants involves both programmed cell death and the inhibition of viral multiplication, which are regulated by independent pathways.Resistant plants respond rapidly to invading avirulent plant viruses by triggering a hypersensitive response (HR). An HR is accompanied by a restraint of virus multiplication and programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), both of which have been observed in systemic necrosis triggered by a successful viral infection. Here, we analyzed signaling pathways underlying the HR in resistance genotype plants and those leading to systemic necrosis. We show that systemic necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana, induced by Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) infection, was associated with PCD, biochemical features, and gene expression patterns that are characteristic of HR. The induction of necrosis caused by PlAMV infection was dependent on SGT1, RAR1, and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade involving MAPKKKalpha and MEK2. However, although SGT1 and RAR1 silencing led to an increased accumulation of PlAMV, silencing of the MAPKKKalpha-MEK2 cascade did not. This observation indicates that viral multiplication is partly restrained even in systemic necrosis induced by viral infection, and that this restraint requires SGT1 and RAR1 but not the MAPKKKalpha-MEK2 cascade. Similarly, although both SGT1 and MAPKKKalpha were essential for the Rx-mediated HR to Potato virus X (PVX), SGT1 but not MAPKKKalpha was involved in the restraint of PVX multiplication. These results suggest that systemic necrosis and HR consist of PCD and a restraint of virus multiplication, and that the latter is induced through unknown pathways independent from the former.",M1
20107599,"Persistent ER stress induces the spliced leader RNA silencing pathway (SLS), leading to programmed cell death in Trypanosoma brucei.Trypanosomes are parasites that cycle between the insect host (procyclic form) and mammalian host (bloodstream form). These parasites lack conventional transcription regulation, including factors that induce the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, they possess a stress response mechanism, the spliced leader RNA silencing (SLS) pathway. SLS elicits shut-off of spliced leader RNA (SL RNA) transcription by perturbing the binding of the transcription factor tSNAP42 to its cognate promoter, thus eliminating trans-splicing of all mRNAs. Induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in procyclic trypanosomes elicits changes in the transcriptome similar to those induced by conventional UPR found in other eukaryotes. The mechanism of up-regulation under ER stress is dependent on differential stabilization of mRNAs. The transcriptome changes are accompanied by ER dilation and elevation in the ER chaperone, BiP. Prolonged ER stress induces SLS pathway. RNAi silencing of SEC63, a factor that participates in protein translocation across the ER membrane, or SEC61, the translocation channel, also induces SLS. Silencing of these genes or prolonged ER stress led to programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), evident by exposure of phosphatidyl serine, DNA laddering, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as typical morphological changes observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). ER stress response is also induced in the bloodstream form and if the stress persists it leads to SLS. We propose that prolonged ER stress induces SLS, which serves as a unique death pathway, replacing the conventional caspase-mediated PCD observed in higher eukaryotes.",M1
20094801,"Apoptotic-like regulation of programmed cell death in plants.In plants, apoptotic-like programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) can be distinguished from other forms of plant cell death by protoplast condensation that results in a morphologically distinct cell corpse. In addition, there is a central regulatory role for the mitochondria and the degradation of the cell and its contents by PCD associated proteases. These distinguishing features are shared with animal apoptosis as it is probable that plant and animal cell death programmes arose in a shared unicellular ancestor. However, animal and plant cell death pathways are not completely conserved. The cell death programmes may have been further modified after the divergence of plant and animal lineages leading to converged, or indeed unique, features of their respective cell death programmes. In this review we will examine the features of apoptotic-like PCD in plants and examine the probable conserved components such as mitochondrial regulation through the release of apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, the possible conserved or converged features such as  caspase-like  molecules which drive cellular destruction and the emerging unique features of plant PCD such as chloroplast involvement in cell death regulation.",M1
20075938,"Apoptosis in yeast: triggers, pathways, subroutines.A cell's decision to die is controlled by a sophisticated network whose deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases including neoplastic and neurodegenerative disorders. The finding, more than a decade ago, that baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) can undergo apoptosis uncovered the possibility to investigate this mode of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in a model organism that combines both technical advantages and a eukaryotic 'cell room.' Since then, numerous exogenous and endogenous triggers have been found to induce yeast apoptosis and multiple yeast orthologs of crucial metazoan apoptotic regulators have been identified and characterized at the molecular level. Such apoptosis-relevant orthologs include proteases such as the yeast caspase as well as several mitochondrial and nuclear proteins that contribute to the execution of apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. Additionally, physiological scenarios such as aging and failed mating have been discovered to trigger apoptosis in yeast, providing a teleological interpretation of PCD affecting a unicellular organism. Due to its methodological and logistic simplicity, yeast constitutes an ideal model organism that is efficiently helping to decipher the cell death regulatory network of higher organisms, including the switches between apoptotic, autophagic, and necrotic pathways of cellular catabolism. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the apoptotic subroutine of yeast PCD and its regulation.",M1
20075858,"Function of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase in innate immunity-mediated programmed cell death.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) initiated at the pathogen-infected sites during the plant innate immune response is thought to prevent the development of disease. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of an ER-localized type IIB Ca(2+)-ATPase (NbCA1) that function as a regulator of PCD. Silencing of NbCA1 accelerates viral immune receptor N- and fungal-immune receptor Cf9-mediated PCD, as well as non-host pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the general elicitor cryptogein-induced cell death. The accelerated PCD rescues loss-of-resistance phenotype of Rar1, HSP90-silenced plants, but not SGT1-silenced plants. Using a genetically encoded calcium sensor, we show that downregulation of NbCA1 results in the modulation of intracellular calcium signalling in response to cryptogein elicitor. We further show that NbCAM1 and NbrbohB function as downstream calcium decoders in N-immune receptor-mediated PCD. Our results indicate that ER-Ca(2+)-ATPase is a component of the calcium efflux pathway that controls PCD during an innate immune response.",M1
20061552,"Tomato 14-3-3 protein 7 positively regulates immunity-associated programmed cell death by enhancing protein abundance and signaling ability of MAPKKK {alpha}.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is triggered when Pto, a Ser-Thr protein kinase, recognizes either the AvrPto or AvrPtoB effector from Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. This PCD requires mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK alpha ) as a positive regulator in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Nicotiana benthamiana. To examine how PCD-eliciting activity of the tomato MAPKKK alpha protein is regulated, we screened for MAPKKK alpha -interacting proteins in tomato and identified a 14-3-3 protein, TFT7. Virus-induced gene silencing using the TFT7 gene in N. benthamiana compromised both Pto- and MAPKKK alpha -mediated PCD, and coexpression of TFT7 with tomato MAPKKK alpha enhanced MAPKKK alpha -mediated PCD. TFT7 was also required for PCD associated with several other disease resistance proteins and contributed to resistance against P. syringae pv tomato. Coexpression of TFT7 with MAPKKK alpha in vivo caused increased accumulation of the kinase and enhanced phosphorylation of two MAP kinases. TFT7 protein contains a phosphopeptide binding motif that is present in human 14-3-3 epsilon, and substitutions in this motif abolished interaction with MAPKKK alpha in vivo and also the PCD-enhancing activity of TFT7. A 14-3-3 binding motif, including a putative phosphorylated Ser-535, is present in the C-terminal region of MAPKKK alpha. An S535A substitution in MAPKKK alpha reduced interaction with TFT7 and both PCD-eliciting ability and stability of MAPKKK alpha. Our results provide new insights into a role for 14-3-3 proteins in regulating immunity-associated PCD pathways in plants.",M1
20040274,"Programmed cell death and apoptosis in aging and life span regulation.Increasing evidence suggests an important role for programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) pathways in aging phenotypes across species. PCD is critical to the homeostasis of tissues maintained by cell division, for example, the blood and the lining of the gut. During aging, accumulated cellular damage and non-optimal systemic signaling can cause too little cell death (hyperproliferation and cancer), or too much cell death (tissue atrophy and ectopic cell death), thereby limiting tissue function and life span. For these reasons PCD pathways are promising targets for interventions in aging and aging-related diseases: reactivation of PCD may be beneficial in clearing cancerous and senescent cells, whereas inhibiting PCD may help prevent muscle atrophy and nervous system degeneration.",M1
20037868,"[The role of apoptosis and protective effect of carnitine in contralateral testicular injury in experimental unilateral testicular torsion]BACKGROUND: We examined the role of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in the etiology of contralateral testis injury as well as the protective effect of carnitine. METHODS: Thirty-six Wistar Albino rats were used in the study. Rats were divided into six groups as control, sham, torsion-detorsion with 6- and 24-hour intervals, and torsion-detorsion-carnitine administration with 6- and 24-hour intervals. The left testes of all rats were torsioned 720 degrees. Intraperitoneal carnitine was administered to groups as 100 mg/kg one hour before detorsion. Orchiectomy was applied to the contralateral testis a week after detorsion. Testes were examined with respect to diameters of seminiferous tubules (DST), ratios of malonyl dialdehyde and Johnsen biopsy scores (JBS), and PCD ratios. Results were evaluated by ANOVA test. RESULTS: Programmed cell death ratios were significantly higher in the torsion-detorsion with 6- and 24-hour intervals groups compared to the sham group. Those increases were more prominent in the torsion-detorsion with 24-hour interval group. DST and JBS of the control group were significantly higher than in the experimental groups (p &lt; 0.05). The protective effect of carnitine was significant in the 24-hour torsion group, while no significant difference were detected in the 6-hour torsion-detorsion-carnitine group. CONCLUSION: Increased injury and PCD in the contralateral testis was observed with prolonged exposure time in this model. It was possible to decrease the injury with carnitine.",M1
20022633,"Nuclear calcium controls the apoptotic-like cell death induced by d-erythro-sphinganine in tobacco cells.Studies performed in animals have highlighted the major role of sphingolipids in regulating the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Sphingolipids have also been shown to induce cell death in plants via calcium-based signalling pathways but the contribution of free cytosolic and/or nuclear calcium in the overall process has never been evaluated. Here, we show that increase in tobacco BY-2 cells of the endogenous content of Long Chain Bases (LCBs) caused by external application of d-erythro-sphinganine (DHS) is followed by immediate dose-dependent elevations of cellular free calcium concentration within the first minute in the cytosol and 10min later in the nucleus. Cells challenged with DHS enter a death process through apoptotic-like mechanisms. Lanthanum chloride, a general blocker of calcium entry, suppresses the cellular calcium variations and the <e>PCD</e> induced by DHS. Interestingly, dl-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP5) and [(+)-dizocilpine] (MK801), two inhibitors of animal and plant ionotropic glutamate receptors, suppress DHS-induced cell death symptoms by selectively inhibiting the variations of nuclear calcium concentration. The selective action of these compounds demonstrates the crucial role of nuclear calcium signature in controlling DHS-induced cell death in tobacco cells.",M1
20014438,"Hyperosmotic stress induces autophagy and apoptosis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell culture.During recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cell culture, various events, such as feeding with concentrated nutrient solutions or the addition of base to maintain an optimal pH, increase the osmolality of the medium. To determine the effect of hyperosmotic stress on two types of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), apoptosis and autophagy, of rCHO cells, two rCHO cell lines, producing antibody and erythropoietin, were subjected to hyperosmotic stress resulting from NaCl addition (310-610 mOsm/kg). For both rCHO cell lines, hyperosmolality up to 610 mOsm/kg increased cleaved forms of PARP, caspase-3, caspase-7, and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, confirming the previous observation that apoptosis was induced by hyperosmotic stress. Concurrently, hyperosmolality increased the level of accumulation of LC3-II, a widely used autophagic marker, which was determined by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. When glucose and glutamine concentrations were measured during the cultures, glucose and glutamine concentrations in the culture medium at various osmolalities (310-610 mOsm/kg) showed no significant differences. This result suggests that induction of PCD by hyperosmotic stress occurred independently of nutrient depletion. Taken together, autophagy as well as apoptosis was observed in rCHO cells subjected to hyperosmolality.",M1
20012170,"Salicylic acid differentially affects suspension cell cultures of Lotus japonicus and one of its non-symbiotic mutants.Salicylic acid (SA) is known to play an important role in the interaction between plant and micro-organisms, both symbiotic and pathogen. In particular, high levels of SA block nodule formation and mycorrhizal colonization in plants. A mutant of Lotus japonicus, named Ljsym4-2, was characterized as unable to establish positive interactions with Rhizobium and fungi (NOD(-), MYC(-)); in particular, it does not recognize signal molecules released by symbiotic micro-organisms so that eventually, epidermal cells undergo <e>PCD</e> at the contact area. We performed a detailed characterization of wild-type and Ljsym4-2 cultured cells by taking into account several parameters characterizing cell responses to SA, a molecule strongly involved in defense signaling pathways. In the presence of 0.5 mM SA, Ljsym4-2 suspension-cultured cells reduce their growth and eventually die, whereas in order to induce the same effects in wt suspension cells, SA concentration must be raised to 1.5 mM. An early and short production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in wt-treated cells. In contrast, a continuous production of NO and a double-peak ROS response, similar to that reported after a pathogenic attack, was observed in the mutant Ljsym4-2 cells. At the molecular level, a constitutive higher level of a SA-inducible pathogenesis related gene was observed. The analysis in planta revealed a strong induction of the LjPR1 gene in the Ljsym4-2 mutant inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti.",M1
19947911,"Involvement of ethylene and nitric oxide in cell death in mastoparan-treated unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.This work demonstrates a contribution of ethylene and NO (nitric oxide) in MP (mastoparan)-induced cell death in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Following MP treatment, C. reinhardtii showed massive cell death, expressing morphological features of <e>PCD</e> (programmed cell death). A pharmacological approach involving combined treatments with MP and ethylene- and NO-interacting compounds indicated the requirement of trace amounts of both ethylene and NO in MP-induced cell death. By employing a carbon dioxide laser-based photoacoustic detector to measure ethylene and a QCL (quantum cascade laser)-based spectrometer for NO detection, simultaneous increases in the production of both ethylene and NO were observed following MP application. Our results show a tight regulation of the levels of both signalling molecules in which ethylene stimulates NO production and NO stimulates ethylene production. This suggests that, in conjunction with the elicitor, NO and ethylene cooperate and act synchronously in the mediation of MP-induced PCD in C. reinhardtii. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the functional significance of ethylene and NO in MP-induced cell death.",M1
19941868,"Effects of zinc on programmed cell death of Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster blood cells.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and phagocytotic activity of immune cells play a pivotal role in insect development. We examined the influence of Zn(2+), an important element to fundamental biological processes, on phagocytosis and apoptosis of hemocytes in two fly species: Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster. Hemocytes were isolated from the third instar larvae of both species and treated for 3h with zinc chloride solutions, containing 0.35 mM or 1.7 mM of Zn(2+), and untreated as control. Phagocytotic activity of hemocytes was examined by flow cytometry after adding latex fluorescent beads to the medium, while apoptosis was evaluated by application of annexinV-FITC and pan-caspase-FITC inhibitor. Mitochondrial viability was determined by measuring resazurin absorbancy in the cell medium. The obtained results showed that Zn(2+) increases phagocytosis and affects PCD of both species hemocytes but each in a different way. Zinc decreases fraction of annexin-positive hemocytes in M. domestica but increases it in D. melanogaster. The pan-caspase analysis revealed low and high activity of caspases in hemocytes of M. domestica and D. melanogaster, respectively. Zn(2+) also decreased the viability of hemocyte mitochondria but only in D. melanogaster. It suggests that flies use different pathways of PCD, or that Zn plays a different role in this process in M. domestica than in D. melanogaster.",M1
19941863,"Yeast acetic acid-induced programmed cell death can occur without cytochrome c release which requires metacaspase YCA1.To investigate the role of cytochrome c (cyt c) release in yeast acetic acid-induced programmed cell death (AA-<e>PCD</e>), wild type (wt) and cells lacking metacaspase (Deltayca1), cytochrome c (Deltacyc1,7) and both (Deltacyc1,7Deltayca1) were compared for AA-PCD occurrence, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production and caspase activity. AA-PCD occurs in Deltacyc1,7 and Deltacyc1,7Deltayca1 cells slower than in wt, but similar to that in Deltayca1 cells, in which no cytochrome c release occurs. Both H(2)O(2) production and caspase activation occur in these cells with early and extra-activation in Deltacyc1,7 cells. We conclude that alternative death pathways can be activated in yeast AA-PCD, one dependent on cyt c release, which requires YCA1, and the other(s) independent on it.",M1
19937341,"Short-term salinity stress in tobacco plants leads to the onset of animal-like <e>PCD</e> hallmarks in planta in contrast to long-term stress.Recent results have identified mitochondria as centers of stress-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in plants. Depolarization of plant mitochondrial membrane during stress results the release of programmed cell death (PCD)-inducing factors in the cytosol in a fashion similar to the onset of animal-like PCD. Herein, we report significant similarities of animal-like PCD and salinity stress-induced plant PCD. Short-term salinity stress (3 h) led to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, release of cytochrome c (CYT-c), which was visualized using a contemporary molecular technique, activation of caspase-3 type proteases and the onset of PCD in wild type tobacco plants, Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana. However, PCD was not manifested during long-term salinity stress (24 h). Interestingly long-term salinity stress led to necrotic-like features, which were accompanied by collapse of respiration, reduction of key components of the respiratory chain, such as CYT-c and alternative oxidase, ATP depletion and high proteolytic activity. The results suggest that salinity stress of tobacco plants in planta leads to the onset of animal-like PCD only during the early stages post-stress, while long-term stress leads to necrotic-like features.",M1
19935772,"S100A8/A9 induces autophagy and apoptosis via ROS-mediated cross-talk between mitochondria and lysosomes that involves BNIP3.The complex formed by two members of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, S100A8/A9, exerts apoptosis-inducing activity in various cells of different origins. Here, we present evidence that the underlying molecular mechanisms involve both programmed cell death I (<e>PCD</e> I, apoptosis) and PCD II (autophagy)-like death. Treatment of cells with S100A8/A9 caused the increase of Beclin-1 expression as well as Atg12-Atg5 formation. S100A8/A9-induced cell death was partially inhibited by the specific PI3-kinase class III inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and by the vacuole H(+)-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1). S100A8/A9 provoked the translocation of BNIP3, a BH3 only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member, to mitochondria. Consistent with this finding, DeltaTM-BNIP3 overexpression partially inhibited S100A8/A9-induced cell death, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and partially protected against the decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential in S100A8/A9-treated cells. In addition, either DeltaTM-BNIP3 overexpression or N-acetyl-L-cysteine co-treatment decreased lysosomal activation in cells treated with S100A8/A9. Our data indicate that S100A8/A9-promoted cell death occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via ROS and the process involves BNIP3.",M1
19933317,"Chloroplast and reactive oxygen species involvement in apoptotic-like programmed cell death in Arabidopsis suspension cultures.Chloroplasts produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cellular stress. ROS are known to act as regulators of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in plant and animal cells, so it is possible that chloroplasts have a role in regulating PCD in green tissue. Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures are model systems in which to test this, as here it is shown that their cells contain well-developed, functional chloroplasts when grown in the light, but not when grown in the dark. Heat treatment at 55 degrees C induced apoptotic-like (AL)-PCD in the cultures, but light-grown cultures responded with significantly less AL-PCD than dark-grown cultures. Chloroplast-free light-grown cultures were established using norflurazon, spectinomycin, and lincomycin and these cultures responded to heat treatment with increased AL-PCD, demonstrating that chloroplasts affect AL-PCD induction in light-grown cultures. Antioxidant treatment of light-grown cultures also resulted in increased AL-PCD induction, suggesting that chloroplast-produced ROS may be involved in AL-PCD regulation. Cycloheximide treatment of light-grown cultures prolonged cell viability and attenuated AL-PCD induction; however, this effect was less pronounced in dark-grown cultures, and did not occur in antioxidant-treated light-grown cultures. This suggests that a complex interplay between light, chloroplasts, ROS, and nuclear protein synthesis occurs during plant AL-PCD. The results of this study highlight the importance of taking into account the time-point at which cells are observed and whether the cells are light-grown and chloroplast-containing or not, for any study on plant AL-PCD, as it appears that chloroplasts can play a significant role in AL-PCD regulation.",M1
19884251,"A kiss of death--proteasome-mediated membrane fusion and programmed cell death in plant defense against bacterial infection.Eukaryotes have evolved various means for controlled and organized cellular destruction, known as programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). In plants, PCD is a crucial regulatory mechanism in multiple physiological processes, including terminal differentiation, senescence, and disease resistance. In this issue of Genes &amp; Development, Hatsugai and colleagues (pp. 2496-2506) demonstrate a novel plant defense strategy to trigger bacteria-induced PCD, involving proteasome-dependent tonoplast and plasma membrane fusion followed by discharge of vacuolar antimicrobial and death-inducing contents into the apoplast.",M1
19876739,"Apoptosis: Focus on sea urchin development.It has been proposed that the apoptosis is an essential requirement for the evolution of all animals, in fact the apoptotic program is highly conserved from nematodes to mammals. Throughout development, apoptosis is employed by multicellular organisms to eliminate damaged or unnecessary cells. Here, we will discuss both developmental programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) under normal conditions and stress induced apoptosis, in sea urchin embryos. Sea urchin represent an excellent model system for studying embryogenesis and cellular processes involved in metamorphosis. PCD plays an essential role in sculpting and remodelling the embryos and larvae undergoing metamorphosis. Moreover, this marine organism directly interacts with its environment, and is susceptible to effects of several aquatic contaminants. Apoptosis can be adopted as a defence mechanism against any environmental chemical, physical and mechanical stress, for removing irreversibly damaged cells. This review, while not comprehensive in its reporting, aims to provide an overview of current knowledge on mechanisms to regulate physiological and the induced apoptotic program in sea urchin embryos.",M1
19860181,"[Hematopoietic cell death and leukemia]Leukemogenesis is thought to be a multistep process involving changes in the expression or abnormalities in the function of proteins encorded by a number of genes within the same cell. Such abnormalities affect the balance among cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), and this lead to an expansion of the malignant clone. Apoptosis (type I PCD) and autophagy (type II PCD) are any form of cell death, mediated by an intracellular program, and involved in cell homeostasis. However, the mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy is extremely complex in leukemia cells, and the molecular machinery is still obscure. Therefore, understanding the regulation of apoptotic and autophagic signaling pathways could provide important information for the development of novel therapies in leukemia cells.",M1
19850457,"Glucose metabolism and programmed cell death: an evolutionary and mechanistic perspective.Over the last decade, cellular glucose metabolism has emerged as a central player in the mechanisms of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). We examined the metabolic foundations of apoptosis from a Darwinian context and suggest that PCD has evolved from the cellular response to metabolic stress, most notably in relation to glucose metabolism. Whilst apoptosis and other forms of PCD are essential to the development, maintenance and survival of multicellular organisms, it is now evident that controlled and selective cell death confers fitness advantages in unicellular organisms. All species may thus harbour a fundamental relationship between the availability of basic nutrients and life/death decisions. This evolutionary perspective may inform our understanding of PCD in its many guises.",M1
19834734,"Mitochondrial bioenergetics linked to the manifestation of programmed cell death during somatic embryogenesis of Abies alba.The present work reports changes in bioenergetic parameters and mitochondrial activities during the manifestation of two events of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), linked to Abies alba somatic embryogenesis. PCD, evidenced by in situ nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay), DNA laddering and cytochrome c release, was decreased in maturing embryogenic tissue with respect to the proliferation stage. In addition, the major cellular energetic metabolites (ATP, NAD(P)H and glucose-6-phosphate) were highered during maturation. The main mitochondrial activities changed during two developmental stages. Mitochondria, isolated from maturing, with respect to proliferating cell masses, showed an increased activity of the alternative oxidase, external NADH dehydrogenase and fatty-acid mediated uncoupling. Conversely, a significant decrease of the mitochondrial K (ATP)(+) channel activity was observed. These results suggest a correlation between mitochondrial activities and the manifestation of PCD during the development of somatic embryos. In particular, it is suggested that the K (ATP)(+) channel activity could induce an entry of K(+) into the matrix, followed by swelling and a release of cytochrome c during proliferation, whereas the alternative pathways, acting as anti-apoptotic factors, may partially counteract PCD events occurring during maturation of somatic embryos.",M1
19833761,"A novel membrane fusion-mediated plant immunity against bacterial pathogens.Plants have developed their own defense strategies because they have no immune cells. A common plant defense strategy involves programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) at the infection site, but how the PCD-associated cell-autonomous immunity is executed in plants is not fully understood. Here we provide a novel mechanism underlying cell-autonomous immunity, which involves the fusion of membranes of a large central vacuole with the plasma membrane, resulting in the discharge of vacuolar antibacterial proteins to the outside of the cells, where bacteria proliferate. The extracellular fluid that was discharged from the vacuoles of infected leaves had both antibacterial activity and cell death-inducing activity. We found that a defect in proteasome function abolished the membrane fusion associated with both disease resistance and PCD in response to avirulent bacterial strains but not to a virulent strain. Furthermore, RNAi plants with a defective proteasome subunit PBA1 have reduced DEVDase activity, which is an activity associated with caspase-3, one of the executors of animal apoptosis. The plant counterpart of caspase-3 has not yet been identified. Our results suggest that PBA1 acts as a plant caspase-3-like enzyme. Thus, this novel defense strategy through proteasome-regulating membrane fusion of the vacuolar and plasma membranes provides plants with a mechanism for attacking intercellular bacterial pathogens.",M1
19830825,"Baculovirus P35 protein: an overview of its applications across multiple therapeutic and biotechnological arenas.Baculovirus immediate early P35 protein is well known for its anti-apoptotic as well as anti-oxidant properties. Mechanism of action of P35 involves inhibition of a vast range of initiator to executioner class of caspases. In addition, P35's role in inhibiting oxidant-induced mitochondrial damage, primarily in the apoptotic pathway, has also been extensively investigated. Elucidation of P35's functions during regulation of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) has led to a renewed focus on exploiting this basic knowledge for clinical and other related applications. This review outlines specific biochemical and genetic pathways where P35 intervenes and regulates rate-limiting steps in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Research efforts are underway to utilize P35 as an agent in regulating apoptosis and under certain circumstances, also explore the therapeutic potential of its anti-oxidant features. One of the major outcomes of recent studies include significantly improved effectiveness of cytochrome P450 directed enzyme pro-drug delivery tools when used in conjunction with P35, which may help in alleviating drug resistance in tumor cells and simultaneously prolonging the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, applied research carried out recently in the fields of diabetes, ischemia-induced neuronal cell death, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory arthritis, cardiovascular and ocular disorders illustrate P35's utilization across diverse therapeutic areas and will certainly make it an attractive biomolecule for the discovery research.",M1
19826239,"Pine embryogenesis: many licences to kill for a new life.In plants, programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is an important mechanism that controls normal growth and development as well as many defence responses. At present, research on PCD in different plant species is actively carried out due to the possibilities offered by modern methods in molecular biology and the increasing amount of genome data. The pine seed provides a favourable model for PCD because it represents an interesting inheritance of seed tissues as well as an anatomically well-described embryogenesis during which several tissues die via morphologically different PCD processes.",M1
19825589,"Initiation of programmed cell death in self-incompatibility: role for cytoskeleton modifications and several caspase-like activities.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is an important and universal process regulating precise death of unwanted cells in eukaryotes. In plants, the existence of PCD has been firmly established for about a decade, and many components shown to be involved in apoptosis/PCD in mammalian systems are found in plant cells undergoing PCD. Here, we review work from our lab demonstrating the involvement of PCD in the self-incompatibility response in Papaver rhoeas pollen. This utilization of PCD as a consequence of a specific pollen-pistil interaction provides a very neat way to destroy unwanted 'self', but not 'non-self' pollen. We discuss recent data providing evidence for SI-induced activation of several caspase-like activities and suggest that an acidification of the cytosol may be a key turning point in the activation of caspase-like proteases executing PCD. We also review data showing the involvement of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons as well as that of a MAPK in signalling to caspase-mediated PCD. Potential links between these various components in signalling to PCD are discussed. Together, this begins to build a picture of PCD in a single cell system, triggered by a receptor-ligand interaction.",M1
19820703,"Tudor staphylococcal nuclease is an evolutionarily conserved component of the programmed cell death degradome.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is executed by proteases, which cleave diverse proteins thus modulating their biochemical and cellular functions. Proteases of the caspase family and hundreds of caspase substrates constitute a major part of the PCD degradome in animals. Plants lack close homologues of caspases, but instead possess an ancestral family of cysteine proteases, metacaspases. Although metacaspases are essential for PCD, their natural substrates remain unknown. Here we show that metacaspase mcII-Pa cleaves a phylogenetically conserved protein, TSN (Tudor staphylococcal nuclease), during both developmental and stress-induced PCD. TSN knockdown leads to activation of ectopic cell death during reproduction, impairing plant fertility. Surprisingly, human TSN (also known as p100 or SND1), a multifunctional regulator of gene expression, is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. This cleavage impairs the ability of TSN to activate mRNA splicing, inhibits its ribonuclease activity and is important for the execution of apoptosis. Our results establish TSN as the first biological substrate of metacaspase and demonstrate that despite the divergence of plants and animals from a common ancestor about one billion years ago and their use of distinct PCD pathways, both have retained a common mechanism to compromise cell viability through the cleavage of the same substrate, TSN.",M1
19818125,"Differential protection by wildtype vs. organelle-specific Bcl-2 suggests a combined requirement of both the ER and mitochondria in ceramide-mediated caspase-independent programmed cell death.BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is essential for development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms and can occur by caspase-dependent apoptosis or alternatively, by caspase-independent PCD (ciPCD). Bcl-2, a central regulator of apoptosis, localizes to both mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Whereas a function of mitochondrial and ER-specific Bcl-2 in apoptosis has been established in multiple studies, corresponding data for ciPCD do not exist. METHODS: We utilized Bcl-2 constructs specifically localizing to mitochondria (Bcl-2 ActA), the ER (Bcl-2 cb5), both (Bcl-2 WT) or the cytosol/nucleus (Bcl-2 DeltaTM) and determined their protective effect on ceramide-mediated ciPCD in transiently and stably transfected Jurkat cells. Expression of the constructs was verified by immunoblots. Ceramide-mediated ciPCD was induced by treatment with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor and determined by flow cytometric measurement of propidium iodide uptake as well as by optical analysis of cell morphology. RESULTS: Only wildtype Bcl-2 had the ability to efficiently protect from ceramide-mediated ciPCD, whereas expression of Bcl-2 solely at mitochondria, the ER, or the cytosol/nucleus did not prevent ceramide-mediated ciPCD. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a combined requirement for both mitochondria and the ER in the induction and the signaling pathways of ciPCD mediated by ceramide.",M1
19812700,"Crosstalks between myo-inositol metabolism, programmed cell death and basal immunity in Arabidopsis.BACKGROUND: Although it is a crucial cellular process required for both normal development and to face stress conditions, the control of programmed cell death in plants is not fully understood. We previously reported the isolation of ATXR5 and ATXR6, two PCNA-binding proteins that could be involved in the regulation of cell cycle or cell death. A yeast two-hybrid screen using ATXR5 as bait captured AtIPS1, an enzyme which catalyses the committed step of myo-inositol (MI) biosynthesis. atips1 mutants form spontaneous lesions on leaves, raising the possibility that MI metabolism may play a role in the control of <e>PCD</e> in plants. In this work, we have characterised atips1 mutants to gain insight regarding the role of MI in PCD regulation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: - lesion formation in atips1 mutants depends of light intensity, is due to PCD as evidenced by TUNEL labelling of nuclei, and is regulated by phytohormones such as salicylic acid - MI and galactinol are the only metabolites whose accumulation is significantly reduced in the mutant, and supplementation of the mutant with these compounds is sufficient to prevent PCD - the transcriptome profile of the mutant is extremely similar to that of lesion mimic mutants such as cpr5, or wild-type plants infected with pathogens. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for the role of MI or MI derivatives in the regulation of PCD. Interestingly, there are three isoforms of IPS in Arabidopsis, but AtIPS1 is the only one harbouring a nuclear localisation sequence, suggesting that nuclear pools of MI may play a specific role in PCD regulation and opening new research prospects regarding the role of MI in the prevention of tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the significance of the interaction between AtIPS1 and ATXR5 remains to be established.",M1
19807669,"Pleiotropic effects of cathepsin D.Over the past decades, the paradigm that lysosomal enzymes participate only in non-specific protein degradation during cell death has changed. Studies conducted both in cell cultures and in animals defined the role of these enzymes that includes cathepsin D (CD). Knockout mice revealed the role of CD in postnatal tissue homeostasis and remodeling. Mutations that abolish the CD enzymatic activity have been implicated in neural ceroid lipofuscinosis. Recent studies suggested a differential role of CD in regulation of apoptosis. The zymogen of CD, procathepsin D (<e>pCD</e>), is secreted by various cancer cells. Extensive studies showed that it acts as a mitogen on both cancer and stromal cells by stimulating their invasive and metastatic properties. Additional studies suggested that procathepsin D/CD is an independent prognostic factor in various cancers, leading to the investigations of pCD/CD as a potential target for designing anti-cancer therapy. In this review, we described the various forms of CD and their implications in numerous physiological as well as pathological conditions.",M1
19787053,"Lysosomal-associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5 gene (LAPTM5) is associated with spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas.BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequently occurring solid tumor in children, and shows heterogeneous clinical behavior. Favorable tumors, which are usually detected by mass screening based on increased levels of catecholamines in urine, regress spontaneously via programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) or mature through differentiation into benign ganglioneuroma (GN). In contrast, advanced-type NB tumors often grow aggressively, despite intensive chemotherapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PCD during spontaneous regression in favorable NB tumors, as well as identifying genes with a pro-death role, is a matter of urgency for developing novel approaches to the treatment of advanced-type NB tumors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that the expression of lysosomal associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) was usually down-regulated due to DNA methylation in an NB cell-specific manner, but up-regulated in degenerating NB cells within locally regressing areas of favorable tumors detected by mass-screening. Experiments in vitro showed that not only a restoration of its expression but also the accumulation of LAPTM5 protein, was required to induce non-apoptotic cell death with autophagic vacuoles and lysosomal destabilization with lysosomal-membrane permeabilization (LMP) in a caspase-independent manner. While autophagy is a membrane-trafficking pathway to degrade the proteins in lysosomes, the LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization with LMP leads to an interruption of autophagic flux, resulting in the accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles, p62/SQSTM1, and ubiqitinated proteins as substrates of autophagic degradation. In addition, ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies appeared in degenerating NB cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel molecular mechanism for PCD with the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles due to LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization. LAPTM5-induced cell death is lysosomal cell death with impaired autophagy, not cell death by autophagy, so-called autophagic cell death. Thus LAPTM5-mediated PCD is closely associated with the spontaneous regression of NBs and opens new avenues for exploring innovative clinical interventions for this tumor.",M1
19770586,"Self-consuming innate immunity in Arabidopsis.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) associated with the pathogen-induced hypersensitive response (HR) is a hallmark of plant innate immunity. HR PCD is triggered upon recognition of pathogen effector molecules by host immune receptors either directly or indirectly via effector modulation of host targets. However, it has been unclear by which molecular mechanisms plants execute PCD during innate immune responses. We recently examined HR PCD in autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis knockout mutants (atg) and find that PCD conditioned by one class of plant innate immune receptors is suppressed in atg mutants. Intriguingly, HR triggered by another class of immune receptors with different genetic requirements is not compromised, indicating that only a specific subset of immune receptors engage the autophagy pathway for HR execution. Thus, our work provides a primary example of autophagic cell death associated with innate immune responses in eukaryotes as well as of prodeath functions for the autophagy pathway in plants.",M1
19754356,"Caspase-independent pathways of programmed cell death: the unraveling of new targets of cancer therapy?In the past few years, accumulating evidence in the literature supports the existence of pathways of caspase-independent programmed cell death (CI-<e>PCD</e>). These pathways are likely to be acting as 'death backup systems' that ensure effective removal of defective cells from the organism. Similar to classical apoptosis i.e. caspase-dependent programmed cell death (CD-PCD), the mitochondrion is the main organelle orchestrating the series of events which are required for the induction of CI-PCD. In addition, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bid are also key participants in CI-PCD. However, contrary to CD-PCD, CI-PCD involves executioners other than the caspases which include the cathepsins, the calpains and serine proteases. The protein AIF may also play an important role in the induction of CI-PCD. In this review we report current knowledge on CI-PCD and provide evidence for its regulation by chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the clinic and under investigation in clinical trials. Lastly, we discuss how the study of natural and synthetic agents triggering CI-PCD may help in the pharmacological design of a new generation of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. The use of such drugs activating both CD-PCD and CI-PCD pathways should achieve a more successful eradication of carcinogenic cells and the attainment of lower levels of tumor resistance.",M1
19705353,"Coumarin A/AA induces apoptosis-like cell death in HeLa cells mediated by the release of apoptosis-inducing factor.It has been demonstrated that naturally occurring coumarins have strong biological activity against many cancer cell lines. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxicity induced by the naturally isolated coumarin A/AA in different cancer cell lines (HeLa, Calo, SW480, and SW620) and in normal peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. The results demonstrate that coumarin A/AA was cytotoxic in the four cancer cell lines tested and importantly was significantly less toxic in PBMCs isolated from healthy donors. The most sensitive cancer cell line to coumarin A/AA treatment was Hela. Thus, the programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) mechanism induced by this coumarin was further studied in this cell line. DNA fragmentation, histomorphology, cell cycle phases, and subcellular distribution of PCD proteins were assessed. The results demonstrated that DNA fragmentation, but not significant cell cycle disruptions, was part of the PCD activated by coumarin A/AA. Interestingly, it was found that apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a proapoptotic protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space, was released to the cytoplasm in treated cells as detected by the western blot analysis in subcellular fractions. Nevertheless, the active form of caspase-3 was not detected. The overall results indicate that coumarin A/AA induces a caspase-independent apoptotic-like cell death program in HeLa cells, mediated by the early release of AIF and suggest that this compound may be helpful in clinical oncology.",M1
19703935,"Signalling pathways involved in 1-nitropyrene (1-NP)-induced and 3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NF)-induced cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells.We previously reported that 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and 3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NF) elicited apoptotic cell death as well as non-apoptotic programmed cell deaths (<e>PCDs</e>) with paraptotic and necroptotic characteristics, respectively. In the present study, we have further confirmed and extended these findings. Flow cytometric analyses of 1-NP-exposed/3NF-exposed Hepa1c1c7 cells revealed that caspase-3 was only activated in the subpopulation of cells corresponding to that with classic apoptotic morphology. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that leucocyte elastase inhibitor-derived DNaseII (LEI/L-DNaseII), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) were more clearly translocated to the nucleus following 3-NF exposure than after 1-NP. These 3-NF-induced changes in AIF and EndoG translocation were reduced by necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptotic cell death. Both compounds lead to accumulation of lipid droplets and induced DNA damage. Activation of checkpoint kinase (CHK) 1 and H2AX, but not ataxia telangiectasia mutated and CHK2, were observed. Furthermore, inhibition of p53 using pifithrin-alpha reduced the cell death induced by both compounds, suggesting a role of DNA damage/CHK1/p53 pathway in the death process. 1-NP-induced cell death was in addition characterized by increased oxidative damage and intracellular accumulation of Ca(2+). These findings further support the notion that 1-NP elicited apoptotic cell death and PCD with paraptotic characteristics, while 3-NF induced apoptosis and a PCD with necroptotic features.",M1
19686374,"Premature tapetum degeneration: a major cause of abortive pollen development in photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility in rice.Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (PSGMS) rice (Oryza sativa L.), a natural mutant found in the rice cultivar Nongken 58, is very useful for the development of hybrid rice cultivars. Despite its widespread use in breeding programs, the initial stage of the abortive development of PSGMS rice and the possible cytological mechanisms of pollen abortion have not been determined. In the present study, a systematic cytological comparison of the anther development of PSGMS rice with its normal fertile counterpart is conducted. The results show that pollen abortion in PSGMS rice first occurs before the pollen mother cell (PMC) stage, and continues during the entire process of pollen development until pollen degradation. The abortive process was closely associated with the abnormal behavior of the tapetum. Although tapetum degeneration in PSGMS rice initiates already at the PMC stage, it proceeds slowly and does not complete until the breakdown of the pollen. Such cytological observations were supported by the results of the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay, which detects DNA fragmentation resulting from programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), indicating that the premature tapetum degeneration is in the process of PCD.",M1
19639341,"Daunomycin accumulation and induction of programmed cell death in rat hair follicles.The anthracycline antibiotic daunomycin (DM) is useful for the treatment of leukemia but has side-effects such as alopecia. Using immunocytochemistry, we show that, after a single i.v. injection, DM accumulates in the nuclei of matrix cells and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. DM-positive matrix cells are detectable up to 48 h after injection and exhibit a characteristic granular morphology, which is not observed in saline-injected controls. TUNEL-staining has revealed that DM injection induces programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in rat hair follicles. Cells undergoing PCD are detectable as late as 5 days postinjection in both the matrix and outer root sheath. Newly developed double-staining has shown that some of the DM-positive matrix cell nuclei are also TUNEL-positive. Staining for activated caspase-3 has demonstrated immunopositive cells following DM administration both in the matrix and in the outer root sheath. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of DM-positive cells with two different types of morphology. About half of the immunopositive cells exhibit a morphology typical of classical apoptosis (PCD type 1), whereas the other half show signs of autophagic cell death (PCD type 2). Interestingly, little, if any, DM accumulation or apoptosis has been detected in the dermal hair papillae. This may have a bearing on potential regeneration of the hair follicles. Thus, DM accumulates in a characteristic pattern in hair follicles. This accumulation is associated with the induction of two morphologically distinct forms of PCD.",M1
19609831,"Endogenous zinc mediates apoptotic programmed cell death in the developing brain.Endogenous zinc can mediate the apoptotic programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in the developing brain. Intensive accumulation of labile zinc occurs in almost all neurons undergoing PCD in the developing rat brain. Based on the greater frequency of neurons with intensive zinc accumulation compared to apoptotic neurons, it is inferred that cytosolic zinc accumulation precedes apoptotic PCD. To determine the role of intracellular labile zinc in developmental apoptosis, we subcutaneously injected the membrane-permeant zinc chelator, N,N,N',N-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) into postnatal rats for 7 days after birth. TPEN chelated intraneuronal zinc without modulating the expression of the zinc-regulating proteins, ZnT-1, ZnT-3, and synaptophysin. The frequency of apoptotic neurons significantly decreased in TPEN-treated rat brains compared with that in normal postnatal rats. Activating cleavages of caspase-9 and -3, and mitochondrial pro-apoptotic Bax expression were reduced, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was increased. Thus, intracerebral zinc chelation may arrest PCD in the developing brain by interfering with the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. The present study demonstrates that intracellular zinc acts as a key mediator of developmental apoptosis and therefore provides the first in vivo evidence that endogenous labile zinc causes neuronal apoptosis.",M1
19609767,"Reliable method for detection of programmed cell death in yeast.Accumulating evidence suggests that yeasts are capable of undergoing programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) to benefit long-term survival of the species, and that yeast and mammals may share at least partially conserved PCD pathways. In our experience, mammalian apoptosis assays have not been readily applicable to yeast. Therefore, to take advantage of yeast as a genetic tool to study PCD, we developed a yeast cell death assay that can reliably reveal viability differences between wild-type strains and strains lacking the mitochondrial fission genes DNM1/Drp1 and FIS1, orthologs of mammalian cell death regulators. Cell viability following treatment with acetic acid is quantified by colony formation and vital dye (FUN1) staining to reproducibly detect dose-dependent, genetically programmed yeast cell death.",M1
19598251,"Apoptosis and autophagy in rat cerebellar granule neuron death: Role of reactive oxygen species.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) has been defined as an active, controlled process in which cells participate in their own demise. Apoptosis, or type I PCD, has been widely characterized, both morphologically and biochemically. More recently, autophagy, the self-digesting mechanism involved in the removal of cytoplasmic long-lived proteins, has been involved in cell death, and type II PCD is defined as cell death occurring with autophagic features. Neurons can undergo more than one type of PCD as a backup mechanism when the traditional death pathway is inhibited or in response to a particular death-inducing stimulus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be important signaling molecules in the execution of apoptosis and, more recently, in the autophagic pathway. In this work, we characterize apoptotic and autophagic cell death in rat cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) culture, a widespread model for the study of neuronal death. Potassium deprivation (K5) and staurosporine (STS) were used for death induction. We found apoptotic and autophagic features under both conditions. Caspase inhibition as well as autophagy inhibition by 3-methyl adenine decreased cell death. Moreover, CGN can undergo the alternative type of cell death when the other one is inhibited. An antioxidant or NADPH oxidase inhibitors delayed apoptosis and had no effect in autophagic features. Thus, we found that autophagy plays a role in cell death of CGN and that, when cells are treated with K5 or STS, both autophagy and ROS seem to promote apoptosis by independent mechanisms.",M1
19557011,"Cell-autonomous requirement for DNaseII in nonapoptotic cell death.DNA fragmentation is a critical component of apoptosis but it has not been characterized in nonapoptotic forms of cell death, such as necrosis and autophagic cell death. In mammalian apoptosis, caspase-activated DNase cleaves DNA into nucleosomal fragments in dying cells, and subsequently DNase II, an acid nuclease, completes the DNA degradation but acts non-cell autonomously within lysosomes of engulfing cells. Here we examine the requirement for DNases during two examples of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) that occurs in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, starvation-induced death of mid-stage egg chambers and developmental nurse cell death in late oogenesis. Surprisingly, we found that DNaseII was required cell autonomously in nurse cells during developmental PCD, indicating that it acts within dying cells. Dying nurse cells contain autophagosomes, indicating that autophagy may contribute to these forms of PCD. Furthermore, we provide evidence that developmental nurse cell PCD in late oogenesis shows hallmarks of necrosis. These findings indicate that DNaseII can act cell autonomously to degrade DNA during nonapoptotic cell death.",M1
19535476,"Real-time detection of caspase-3-like protease activation in vivo using fluorescence resonance energy transfer during plant programmed cell death induced by ultraviolet C overexposure.Caspase-like proteases have been demonstrated to be involved in plant programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). Here, the time scale of caspase-3-like protease activation was investigated in single living plant cells undergoing PCD induced by ultraviolet C (UV-C) overexposure. The real-time detection of caspase-3-like protease activation was achieved by measuring the degree of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) within a recombinant substrate containing enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) linked by a peptide possessing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence, DEVD, to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; i.e. ECFP-DEVD-EYFP). Microscopic observations demonstrated that the ECFP-DEVD-EYFP fusion protein could be expressed correctly and the FRET from ECFP to EYFP could be found in transfected Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protoplasts. At 30 min after exposure to UV-C, caspase-3-like protease activation indicated by the decrease in FRET ratio occurred, taking about 1 h to reach completion in single living protoplasts. Mutation in the DEVD tag or a caspase-3 inhibitor could prevent the changes in FRET ratio induced by UV-C treatment, confirming that the decrease in FRET ratio was due to the cleavage of fusion protein as a result of caspase-3-like protease activation. This activation was further confirmed by in vitro caspase-3 substrate assay and western-blot analysis, showing the occurrence of cleavage in ECFP-DEVD-EYFP protein but not in the protein with a mutant DEVD tag. In summary, these results represent direct evidence for the activation of caspase-3-like protease in UV-C-induced PCD, and the FRET technique is a powerful tool for monitoring key events of PCD in living cells in real time.",M1
19520721,"Transcriptional analysis of the response of Neurospora crassa to phytosphingosine reveals links to mitochondrial function.Treatment of Neurospora crassa cells with phytosphingosine (PHS) induces programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) by an unknown mechanism. To determine the relationship between PHS treatment and PCD, we determined changes in global gene expression levels in N. crassa during a time-course of PHS treatment. Most genes having differential expression levels compared to untreated samples showed an increase in relative expression level upon PHS exposure. However, genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were highly enriched among approximately 100 genes that showed a relative decrease in expression levels after PHS treatment, suggesting that repression of these genes might be related to the death-inducing effects of PHS. Since mutants in respiratory chain complex I are more resistant to both PHS and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) than the wild-type strain, possibly related to the production of reactive oxygen species, we also compared gene expression profiles of a complex I mutant (nuo14) and wild-type in response to H(2)O(2). Genes with higher expression levels in the mutant, in the presence of H(2)O(2), are also significantly enriched in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. These data suggest that complex I mutants cope better with drug-induced decrease in expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and may explain their increased resistance to both PHS and H(2)O(2). As a way of identifying new components required for PHS-induced death, we analysed the PHS sensitivity of 24 strains carrying deletions in genes that showed a significant alteration in expression pattern when the wild-type was exposed to the sphingolipid. Two additional mutants showing increased resistance to PHS were identified and both encode predicted mitochondrial proteins, further supporting the role of the mitochondria in PHS-induced PCD.",M1
19502774,"Identification of autophagy genes in Ciona intestinalis: a new experimental model to study autophagy mechanism.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is a mechanism implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Until recently, apoptosis (self-killing) was the most largely studied mechanism of PCD but a growing number of laboratories are now interested in autophagy (self-eating). In the past few years data showing a tight link between both pathways has accumulated. Until now our laboratory used Ciona intestinalis, a chordate model in which in vivo experiments are possible, to study apoptosis. Recently, we showed that autophagy also occurs in the development of Ciona intestinalis and that the specific markers of both types of death are found in the same tissues and/or in the same cells. These results drove us to postulate that Ciona intestinalis can be a good model to study the link between apoptosis and autophagy. In this article, we conducted an in silico study of autophagy genes. We explored the genomes of Ciona intestinalis, of the second ascidian Ciona savignyi, and those of the classical biological models (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens) to extract and compare autophagy gene sequences. This genomic study was completed by an analysis of: (i) mRNA profile expression during development and (ii) the localization of Beclin protein by immunofluorescent staining in the Ciona intestinalis larvae. Taken together, the results allowed us to conclude that a complex autophagic machinery is present in Ciona intestinalis. Actually, the number of autophagy genes in Ciona intestinalis is comparable to the number of autophagy genes in human.",M1
19465595,"Juvenile hormone counteracts the bHLH-PAS transcription factors MET and GCE to prevent caspase-dependent programmed cell death in Drosophila.Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates many developmental and physiological events in insects, but its molecular mechanism remains conjectural. Here we report that genetic ablation of the corpus allatum cells of the Drosophila ring gland (the JH source) resulted in JH deficiency, pupal lethality and precocious and enhanced programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) of the larval fat body. In the fat body of the JH-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice, two caspase genes that are crucial for PCD induced by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), were significantly upregulated. These results demonstrated that JH antagonizes 20E-induced PCD by restricting the mRNA levels of Dronc and Drice. The antagonizing effect of JH on 20E-induced PCD in the fat body was further confirmed in the JH-deficient animals by 20E treatment and RNA interference of the 20E receptor EcR. Moreover, MET and GCE, the bHLH-PAS transcription factors involved in JH action, were shown to induce PCD by upregulating Dronc and Drice. In the Met- and gce-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice were downregulated, whereas in the Met-overexpression fat body, Dronc and Drice were significantly upregulated leading to precocious and enhanced PCD, and this upregulation could be suppressed by application of the JH agonist methoprene. For the first time, we demonstrate that JH counteracts MET and GCE to prevent caspase-dependent PCD in controlling fat body remodeling and larval-pupal metamorphosis in Drosophila.",M1
19455280,"Study on programmed cell death and dynamic changes of starch accumulation in pericarp cells of Triticum aestivum L.Features of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and dynamic changes of starch accumulation in developing pericarp cells of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were observed and analyzed by periodic acid-Schiff/toluidine blue O double staining, fluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluorescein deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that cellular organelles were orderly disintegrated. TUNEL-positive nuclei were detected at 0 day after flowering (DAF), whereas nuclei showed significant features of degradation at 2 DAF, such as chromatin condensation, nuclei condensation, and nuclei deformation. Then, heterochromatin gradually disappeared and the cellular nucleus was completely degraded. The mitochondria degradation and vacuolation also were detected at 15 DAF. These results indicated that the development of pericarp cells was a typical process of PCD. However, the PCD in pericarp cells had their own characteristics: PCD started early and lasted for a considerable time. In the delayed process of PCD, starch granules were synthesized, deposited, and degraded temporarily in amyloplasts or chloroplasts. The delay of PCD in pericarp cells may be due to sufficient photosynthetic assimilates and energy supply. Besides, normal mitochondria were required for pericarp cells to survive. Pericarp cells contained only compound starch granules. Starch was massively synthesized from 0 to 11 DAF, but it was rapidly degraded after 11 DAF. Therefore, apart from protection, pericarp cells played essential roles in starch synthesis, storage, and degradation, as well as nutrient transportation.",M1
19453434,"Functional redundancy in the Arabidopsis Cathepsin B gene family contributes to basal defence, the hypersensitive response and senescence.Cysteine proteases are required for programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in animals. Recent work in Nicotiana benthamiana has implicated cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases in the hypersensitive response (HR) in plants, a form of PCD involved in disease resistance. Here, we investigate the function and regulation of Cathepsin B (CathB) genes in plant defence, and in both pathogen-inducible and developmental forms of PCD. Single, double and triple knockout mutants were isolated for the three Arabidopsis thaliana AtCathB genes. AtCathB genes were redundantly required for full basal resistance against the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. By contrast, AtCathB genes were not required for R gene-mediated resistance to Pst DC3000 expressing AvrB or AvrRps4. Neither did they contribute to PCD triggered by AvrRps4, although they were crucial for the full development of PCD during HR triggered by AvrB. Cathepsin B has also been proposed to play a positive regulatory role in senescence. Atcathb triple mutants showed a delay in senescence and a seven-fold decrease in accumulation of senescence marker gene SAG12. Our results demonstrate a redundant function for AtCathB genes in basal defence as well as a potential regulatory role in distinct forms of plant PCD.",M1
19451193,"Oxidative stress induces parallel autophagy and mitochondria dysfunction in human glioma U251 cells.Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is an oxidative stress response, which induced various defense mechanisms or programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). As one of the major types of PCD, autophagy has been observed in response to several anticancer drugs and demonstrated to be responsible for cell death. To date, however, the exact mechanism by which ROS regulates autophagy is still poorly understood. Thus, the purposes of this study were to elucidate how H(2)O(2) exerts its cytotoxic effects on malignant glioma U251 cells and to uncover the molecular mechanism that might be involved. Here, we show that H(2)O(2)-induced autophagy and apoptosis in U251 cells are mediated through the Beclin 1 and Akt/mTOR pathways. Accumulation of ROS leads to changes in mitochondrial permeability with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and disruption of mitochondrial dynamics at a transcriptional level of fission and fusion. Overexpression of cellular Bcl-2 partially inhibited autophagy through both the Beclin 1 and the Akt/mTOR pathways and led to recovery of mitochondrial dynamics. When autophagy was prevented at an early stage by 3-methyladenine, apoptosis significantly increased. Our data provide the first evidence that H(2)O(2) induces autophagy through interference with the Beclin 1 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways and is regulated by the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in glioma U251 cells.",M1
19450522,"Autophagic components contribute to hypersensitive cell death in Arabidopsis.Autophagy has been implicated as a prosurvival mechanism to restrict programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) associated with the pathogen-triggered hypersensitive response (HR) during plant innate immunity. This model is based on the observation that HR lesions spread in plants with reduced autophagy gene expression. Here, we examined receptor-mediated HR PCD responses in autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis knockout mutants (atg), and show that infection-induced lesions are contained in atg mutants. We also provide evidence that HR cell death initiated via Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR)-type immune receptors through the defense regulator EDS1 is suppressed in atg mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCD triggered by coiled-coil (CC)-type immune receptors via NDR1 is either autophagy-independent or engages autophagic components with cathepsins and other unidentified cell death mediators. Thus, autophagic cell death contributes to HR PCD and can function in parallel with other prodeath pathways.",M1
19446451,"Programmed cell death in the nervous system--a programmed cell fate?Studies of developmental cell death in the nervous system have revealed two different modes of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). One results from competition for target-derived trophic factors and leads to the stochastic removal of neurons and/or glia. A second, hard-wired form of PCD involves the lineage-specific, stereotypical death of identifiable neurons, glia or undifferentiated cells. Although traditionally associated with invertebrates, this 'programmed PCD' can also occur in vertebrates. Recent studies have shed light on its genetic control and have revealed that activation of the apoptotic machinery can be under the same complex, combinatorial control as the expression of terminal differentiation genes. This review will highlight these findings and will suggest why such complex control evolved.",M1
19430197,"<e>PCD</e> and autophagy in the unicellular green alga Micrasterias denticulata.Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a central role in normal plant development and is also induced by various biotic and abiotic stress factors. In the unicellular freshwater green alga Micrasterias denticulata morphological and biochemical hallmarks such as the appearance of autophagosomes, increased production of ROS and degradation of genomic DNA into small fragments ( DNA laddering ) indicate PCD. Our data not only demonstrate that Micrasterias is capable of performing PCD under salt stress, but also that it is triggered by the ionic and not osmotic component of salinity. Additionally, results from the present and previous studies suggest that different inducers may lead to different cell death pathways in one and the same organism.",M1
19420345,"Role of the immune modulator programmed cell death-1 during development and apoptosis of mouse retinal ganglion cells.PURPOSE: Mammalian programmed cell death (PD)-1 is a membrane-associated receptor regulating the balance between T-cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology; however, its role in neurons has not yet been defined. The hypothesis that PD-1 signaling actively promotes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death within the developing mouse retina was investigated. METHODS: Mature retinal cell types expressing PD-1 were identified by immunofluorescence staining of vertical retina sections; developmental expression was localized by immunostaining and quantified by Western blot analysis. PD-1 involvement in developmental RGC survival was assessed in vitro using retinal explants and in vivo using PD-1 knockout mice. PD-1 ligand gene expression was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: PD-1 is expressed in most adult RGCs and undergoes dynamic upregulation during the early postnatal window of retinal cell maturation and physiological programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). In vitro blockade of PD-1 signaling during this time selectively increases the survival of RGCs. Furthermore, PD-1-deficient mice show a selective increase in RGC number in the neonatal retina at the peak of developmental RGC death. Lastly, gene expression of the immune PD-1 ligand genes Pdcd1lg1 and Pdcd1lg2 was found throughout postnatal retina maturation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively support a novel role for a PD-1-mediated signaling pathway in developmental PCD during postnatal RGC maturation.",M1
19393028,"GABAergic striatal neurons exhibit caspase-independent, mitochondrially mediated programmed cell death.GABAergic striatal neurons are compromised in basal ganglia pathologies and we analysed how insult nature determined their patterns of injury and recruitment of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway during programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). Stressors affecting targets implicated in striatal neurodegeneration [3-morpholinylsydnoneimine (SIN-1), 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), NMDA, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), and staurosporine (STS)] were compared in cultured GABAergic neurons from murine striatum by analyzing the progression of injury and its correlation with mitochondrial involvement, the redistribution of intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, and patterns of protease activation. Stressors produced PCD exhibiting slow-onset kinetics with time-dependent annexin-V labeling and eventual DNA fragmentation. IMS proteins including cytochrome c were differentially distributed, although stressors except STS produced early redistribution of apoptosis-inducing factor and Omi, suggestive of early recruitment of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent signaling. In general, Bax mobilization to mitochondria appeared to promote IMS protein redistribution. Caspase 3 activation was prominent after STS, whereas NMDA and SIN-1 produced mainly calpain activation, and 3-NP and DHPG elicited a mixed profile of protease activation. PCD and redistribution of IMS proteins in striatal GABAergic neurons were canonical and insult-dependent, reflecting differential interplay between the caspase cascade and alternate cell death pathways.",M1
19351640,"Programmed cell death and cancer.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is an important terminal pathway for cells of multicellular organisms, and is involved in a variety of biological events that include morphogenesis, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and elimination of harmful cells. Dysfunction of PCD leads to various diseases in humans, especially various cancers. Accumulating evidence indicates that PCD is closely related to anti-cancer therapy. Recently, many studies have subdivided PCD into the three categories: apoptosis, autophagy, and programmed necrosis, based on criteria such as morphological alterations, initiating death signal, and the activation of caspases. In this article, we will review the main features and functions of all three types of programmed cell death, focusing on their roles in tumour cells and the relationship of the three types of cell death in anti-cancer therapy.",M1
19347278,"The NF-kappaB transcription factor pathway as a therapeutic target in cancer: methods for detection of NF-kappaB activity.NF-kappaB transcription factors marshal innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. NF-kappaB also counters programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, and this activity of NF-kappaB is crucial for organismal physiology, chronic inflammation, and tumorigenesis. Indeed, whereas NF-kappaB contributes to many aspects of oncogenesis, it is now clear that its suppressive action on PCD is central to this process. Notably, recent studies indicate that NF-kappaB represents a crucial link in the well-established association between inflammation and carcinogenesis. In this link, NF-kappaB promotes synthesis of inflammatory mediators (e.g. TNFalpha) that stimulate growth of cancer cells, and upregulates genes that protect these cells against PCD induced by inflammatory signals. Elevated NF-kappaB activity also hampers tumor-cell killing inflicted by radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, and in so doing, promotes resistance to anticancer therapy. Accordingly, NF-kappaB-targeting drugs are increasingly being used for treatment of human malignancies. Owing to the ubiquitous nature of the NF-kappaB pathway, however, these drugs have serious side effects, which limit their clinical use. Thus, a preferable approach would be to block, rather than NF-kappaB itself, its critical downstream targets that mediate discrete functions in cancer, such as prosurvival functions. Recent discoveries unraveling tissue specificity in the NF-kappaB-inducible mechanism(s) for control of PCD and identifying putative effectors of this control clearly validate this therapeutic approach. Given the emerging role of TNFkappa-induced signals of NF-kappaB activation in cancer and the potential of these signals for yielding new anticancer therapies, we focus herein on the methods most commonly used for analysis of the molecular steps leading from the triggering of TNF-Receptor (TNF-R)1 - the primary receptor of TNFalpha - to the induction of NF-kappaB. Specifically, we review the methods used for analysis of TNF-R1 trafficking, assembly of so-called TNF-R1 complex I, formation and activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, phosphorylation and proteolysis of inhibitory IkappaB proteins, post-translational modifications and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB dimers, induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and binding to specific promoters, and upregulation of NF-kappaB target genes. The analysis of these events in cancerous cells may not only provide a better understanding of the basis for the role of NF-kappaB in carcinogenesis, but also potential new targets for selective anticancer therapy.",M1
19341713,"Ced-9 inhibits Al-induced programmed cell death and promotes Al tolerance in tobacco.Our previous data showed that apoptotic suppressors inhibit aluminum (Al)-induced programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and promote Al tolerance in yeast cells, however, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, especially in plants. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans apoptotic suppressor Ced-9, a Bcl-2 homologue, inhibited both the Al-induced PCD and Al-induced activity of caspase-like vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE), a crucial executioner of PCD, in tobacco. Furthermore, we show that Ced-9 significantly alleviated Al inhibition of root elongation, decreased Al accumulation in the root tip and greatly inhibited Al-induced gene expression in early response to Al, leading to enhancing the tolerance of tobacco plants to Al toxicity. Our data suggest that Ced-9 promotes Al tolerance in plants via inhibition of Al-induced PCD, indicating that conserved negative regulators of PCD are involved in integrated regulation of cell survival and Al-induced PCD by an unidentified mechanism.",M1
19337027,"Autophagy regulates progression of programmed cell death during petal senescence in Japanese morning glory.Petal senescence is a type of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) that is tightly regulated by multiple genes. We recently reported that a putative membrane protein, InPSR26, regulates progression of PCD during petal senescence in Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil). Reduced InPSR26 expression in transgenic plants (PSR26r lines) resulted in accelerated petal senescence with hastened development of PCD symptoms, and transcript levels of autophagy-related genes were reduced in the petals. Autophagy visualized by monodansylcadaverine staining indicated reduced autophagic activity in the PSR26r plants. The results from our recent studies suggest that InPSR26 acts to delay the progression of PCD during petal senescence, possibly through regulation of the autophagic process. In this addendum, we discuss the role of autophagy in petal senescence as it relates to these findings.",M1
19297034,"Metal stress induces programmed cell death in aquatic fungi.Aquatic hyphomycetes are a group of fungi that play a key role in organic matter turnover in both clean and metal-polluted streams. We examined the ability of Cu or Zn to induce programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in three aquatic hyphomycete species through the evaluation of typical apoptotic markers, namely reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, caspase-like activity, nuclear morphological alterations, and the occurrence of DNA strand breaks assessed by TUNEL assay. The exposure to both metals induced apoptotic events in all tested aquatic fungi. The most tolerant fungi either to Zn (Varicosporium elodeae) or Cu (Heliscussubmersus) exhibited higher levels of PCD markers, suggesting that PCD processes might be linked to fungal resistance/tolerance to metal stress. Moreover, different patterns of apoptotic markers were found, namely a PCD process independent of ROS accumulation in V. elodeae exposed to Cu, or independent of caspase-like activity in Flagellospora curta exposed to Zn, or even without the occurrence of DNA strand breaks in F. curta exposed to Cu. This suggests that a multiplicity of PCD pathways might be operating in aquatic hyphomycetes. The occurrence of a tightly regulated cell death pathway, such as PCD, in aquatic hyphomycetes under metal stress might be a part of the mechanisms underlying fungal acclimation in metal-polluted streams, because it would allow the rapid removal of unwanted or damaged cells sparing nutrients and space for the fittest ones.",M1
19296126,"Evidence for programmed cell death and activation of specific caspase-like enzymes in the tomato fruit heat stress response.The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruit is the best available model to study the stress response of fleshy fruit. Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) plays an important role in stress responses in mammals and plants. In this study, we provide evidence that PCD is triggered in the tomato fruit heat stress response by detection of the sequential diagnostic PCD events, including release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-like proteases and the presence of TUNEL-positive nuclei. Investigating the time course of these events for 12 h after heat treatment indicated that cytochrome c release and caspase-like protease activation occurred rapidly and were consistent with the onset of DNA fragmentation. In addition, LEHDase and DEVDase enzymes were specifically activated in tomato fruit pericarp during the heat treatment and recovery time. There was no significant activation of YVADase or IETDase proteases. Preincubation of pericarp discs with the broad-spectrum, cell-permeable caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suppressed heat-induced cell death measured by trypan blue, accompanied by a decrease in LEHDase and DEVDase activities.",M1
19278553,"Programmed cell death in host-symbiont associations, viewed through the Gene Ontology.Manipulation of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) is central to many host microbe interactions. Both plant and animal cells use PCD as a powerful weapon against biotrophic pathogens, including viruses, which draw their nutrition from living tissue. Thus, diverse biotrophic pathogens have evolved many mechanisms to suppress programmed cell death, and mutualistic and commensal microbes may employ similar mechanisms. Necrotrophic pathogens derive their nutrition from dead tissue, and many produce toxins specifically to trigger programmed cell death in their hosts. Hemibiotrophic pathogens manipulate PCD in a most exquisite way, suppressing PCD during the biotrophic phase and stimulating it during the necrotrophic phase. This mini-review will summarize the mechanisms that have evolved in diverse microbes and hosts for controlling PCD and the Gene Ontology terms developed by the Plant-Associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO) Consortium for describing those mechanisms.",M1

The regulation of mammary epithelial cells (MEC) apoptosis occurs at three levels, the molecular regulators of autophagy have not been identified yet. There are possible correlations between both processes, because cells sharing morphological features of apoptosis and autophagy were found in involuting mammary gland. Autophagy seems to be cellular defense against starvation, when it fails, a secondary response of apoptotic cell death is triggered.",M1
19266576,"Effect of Bcl-xL overexpression on apoptosis and autophagy in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells under nutrient-deprived condition.Upon nutrient deprivation during culture, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cells are subjected to two types of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), apoptosis and autophagy. To investigate the effect of Bcl-x(L) overexpression on apoptosis and autophagy in rCHO cells, an erythropoietin (EPO)-producing rCHO cell line with regulated Bcl-x(L) overexpression (EPO-off-Bcl-x(L)) was established using the Tet-off system. The expression level of Bcl-x(L) in EPO-off-Bcl-x(L) cells was tightly regulated by doxycycline in a dose-dependent manner. Bcl-x(L) overexpression enhanced cell viability and extended culture longevity in batch culture. Upon nutrient depletion in the later stage of batch culture, Bcl-x(L) overexpression suppressed apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 and -7. Simultaneously, Bcl-x(L) overexpression also delayed autophagy, characterized by LC3-II accumulation. Immunoprecipitation analysis with a Flag-tagged Bcl-x(L) revealed that Bcl-x(L) interacts with Bax and Bak, essential mediators of caspase-dependent apoptosis, as well as with Beclin-1, an essential mediator of autophagy, and may inhibit their pro-cell death function. Taken together, it was found that Bcl-x(L) overexpression inhibits both apoptosis and autophagy in rCHO cell culture.",M1
19246593,"One tissue, two fates: different roles of megagametophyte cells during Scots pine embryogenesis.In the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed, embryos grow and develop within the corrosion cavity of the megagametophyte, a maternally derived haploid tissue, which houses the majority of the storage reserves of the seed. In the present study, histochemical methods and quantification of the expression levels of the programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and DNA repair processes related genes (MCA, TAT-D, RAD51, KU80, and LIG) were used to investigate the physiological events occurring in the megagametophyte tissue during embryo development. It was found that the megagametophyte was viable from the early phases of embryo development until the early germination of mature seeds. However, the megagametophyte cells in the narrow embryo surrounding region (ESR) were destroyed by cell death with morphologically necrotic features. Their cell wall, plasma membrane, and nuclear envelope broke down with the release of cell debris and nucleic acids into the corrosion cavity. The occurrence of necrotic-like cell death in gymnosperm embryogenesis provides a favourable model for the study of developmental cell death with necrotic-like morphology and suggests that the mechanism underlying necrotic cell death is evolutionary conserved.",M1
19236663,"Different involvement of the mitochondrial, plastidial and cytosolic ascorbate-glutathione redox enzymes in heat shock responses.Plant survival under heat stress requires the activation of proper defence mechanisms to avoid the impairment of metabolic functions. Heat stress leads to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. In plants, the ascorbate (ASC)-GSH cycle plays a pivotal role in controlling ROS levels and cellular redox homeostasis. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is the enzyme of this cycle mainly involved in ROS detoxification. In this study, the ASC-GSH cycle enzymes were analysed in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids of tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cultured cells. The cells were also subjected to two different heat shocks (HSs; 35 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) and the cell compartments were isolated in both conditions. The results reported here indicate that moderate HS (35 degrees C) does not affect cell viability, whereas cell exposure to 55 degrees C HS induces programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). In relation to ASC-GSH cycle, the three analysed compartments have specific enzymatic profiles that are diversely altered by the HS treatments. The cytosol contains the highest activity of all ASC-GSH cycle enzymes and the data reported here suggest that it acts as a redox buffer for the whole cells. In particular, the cytosolic APX seems to be the most versatile enzyme, being its activity enhanced after moderate HS and reduced during PCD induction, whereas the other APX isoenzymes are only affected in the cells undergoing PCD. The relevance of the changes in the different ASC-GSH cycle isoenzymes in allowing cell survival or promoting PCD is discussed.",M1
19217306,"Mitochondrial proteome during salt stress-induced programmed cell death in rice.It has been shown that mitochondria play a pivotal role in plant programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). Previous study established a salt stress-induced PCD model in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. WYJ 8th) root tip cells, demonstrated by DNA laddering, cytochrome c release, and TUNEL positive reaction. In this study, the role of mitochondria during the early phase of PCD (2h-PCD) was analyzed in rice roots. After 2h-PCD induction, the integrity of mitochondria decreased slightly, consistent with a small release of cytochrome c. 2h-PCD partially inhibited electron transport, resulting in oxidative burst in mitochondria. However, ATP production maintained constant. Mitochondria proteome were analyzed by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE before and after 2h-PCD induction, and eight PCD-related proteins were identified. Among them, four proteins were up-regulated after PCD induction, which included glycoside hydrolase, mitochondrial heat shock protein 70, 20S proteasome subunit, and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, and four were down-regulated, namely ATP synthase beta subunit, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6b, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 2, and transcription initiation factor eIF-3 epsilon. These results suggested that ATP synthase may not be the major producer of ATP in mitochondria during the early stage of PCD in rice. Glycoside hydrolase may be involved in ETC impairment and ROS burst, and mitochondrial HSP70 is a potential candidate for PCD regulation. The possible roles of other proteins on PCD initiation were also discussed.",M1
19198845,"Transcriptional profiling in response to inhibition of cellulose synthesis by thaxtomin A and isoxaben in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells.The plant cell wall determines cell shape and is the main barrier against environmental challenges. Perturbations in the cellulose content of the wall lead to global modifications in cellular homeostasis, as seen in cellulose synthase mutants or after inhibiting cellulose synthesis. In particular, application of inhibitors of cellulose synthesis such as thaxtomin A (TA) and isoxaben (IXB) initiates a programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells that is dependent on de novo gene transcription. To further understand how TA and IXB activate PCD, a whole genome microarray analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from Arabidopsis suspension cells exposed to TA and IXB. More than 75% of the genes upregulated by TA were also upregulated by IXB, including genes encoding cell wall-related and calcium-binding proteins, defence/stress-related transcription factors, signalling components and cell death-related proteins. Comparisons with published transcriptional analyses revealed that half of these genes were also induced by ozone, wounding, bacterial elicitor, Yariv reagent, chitin and H(2)O(2). These data indicate that both IXB and TA activate a similar gene expression profile, which includes an important subset of genes generally induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stress. However, genes typically activated during the defence response mediated by classical salicylic acid, jasmonate or ethylene signalling pathways were not upregulated in response to TA and IXB. These results suggest that inhibition of cellulose synthesis induces PCD by the activation of common stress-related pathways that would somehow bypass the classical hormone-dependent defence pathways.",M1
19135059,"Differential control of cell death and gene expression during two distinct phases of hormonally-regulated muscle death in the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta.In larvae of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta, the intersegmental muscles (ISMs) span eight abdominal segments and represent the major muscle group. Following pupation, the ISMs in the first two and last two segments undergo programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), while the remaining four segments persist until the time of adult eclosion, when they too undergo PCD. ISM death at adult eclosion is initiated by a decline in the circulating ecdysteroid titer and requires de novo gene expression. In this study we have investigated the hormonal regulation and the patterns of gene expression that accompany both early and late ISM death. We find that distinct endocrine cues regulate these two periods of muscle death. Even though the middle segments of ISMs are exposed to the same endocrine environment as the adjacent cells that die following pupation, they do not express death-associated transcripts until they are specifically signaled to die following adult eclosion. These data indicate that subsets of homologous muscles appear to make segment-specific decisions to couple their endogenous cell death programs to distinctly different developmental cues. Nevertheless, once cell death is initiated, they utilize many of the same molecular components.",M1
19132228,"Regulation of programmed cell death by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1).Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are associated with poor prognosis in cancer. An explanation to the elevated levels of PAI-1 could be a protective response to the increased proteolytic activity, caused by elevated levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) observed in tumours; however, several lines of evidence suggest that PAI-1 may contribute directly to the pathology of the disease. PAI-1 has been reported to have an effect on most of the basic cellular processes including cell adhesion, cell migration, cell invasion, and cell proliferation and increasing numbers of reports suggest that PAI-1 also can regulate programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in cancer cells and normal cells. A number of reports suggest that PAI-1 can inhibit PCD through its pro-adhesive/anti-proteolytic property whereas other reports suggest that PAI-1 induces PCD through its anti-adhesive property. Furthermore, it has been suggested that PAI-1 can either induce or inhibit PCD though activation of cell signalling pathways. This review will focus on the regulation of programmed cell death by PAI-1 in both normal cells and cancer cells.",M1
19118093,"Trauma-hemorrhagic shock-induced pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cell injury utilizes different programmed cell death signaling pathways.Intestinal ischemia after trauma-hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) results in gut barrier dysfunction and the production/release of biologically active and tissue injurious factors in the mesenteric lymph, which, in turn, causes acute lung injury and a systemic inflammatory state. Since T/HS-induced lung injury is associated with pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and was abrogated by mesenteric lymph duct ligation, we sought to investigate the cellular pathways involved. Compared with trauma-sham shock (T/SS) rats, a significant increase in caspase-3 and M30 expression was detected in the pulmonary epithelial cells undergoing PCD, whereas apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), but not caspase-3, was detected in endothelial cells undergoing PCD. This AIF-mediated pulmonary endothelial PCD response was validated in an in situ femoral vein assay where endothelial cells were found to express AIF but not caspase-3. To complement these studies, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HLMEC), and human alveolar type II epithelial cell (A549) lines were used as in vitro models. T/HS lymph induced the nuclear translocation of AIF in HUVEC and HLMEC, and caspase inhibition in these cells did not afford any cytoprotection. For proof of principle, AIF silencing in HUVEC reversed the cytotoxic effects of T/HS on cell viability and DNA fragmentation. In A549 cells, T/HS lymph activated caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, which was partially abrogated by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (zVAD). Additionally, T/HS lymph did not cause the nuclear translocation of AIF in A549 cells. Collectively, T/HS-induced pulmonary endothelial PCD occurs via an AIF-dependent caspase-independent pathway, whereas epithelial cells undergo apoptosis by a caspase-dependent pathway.",M1
19098090,"Ricinosomes predict programmed cell death leading to anther dehiscence in tomato.Successful development and dehiscence of the anther and release of pollen are dependent upon the programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) of the tapetum and other sporophytic tissues. Ultrastructural examination of the developing and dehiscing anther of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) revealed that cells of the interlocular septum, the connective tissue, the middle layer/endothecium, and the epidermal cells surrounding the stomium all exhibit features consistent with progression through PCD. Ricinosomes, a subset of precursor protease vesicles that are unique to some incidents of plant PCD, were also present in all of these cell types. These novel organelles are known to harbor KDEL-tailed cysteine proteinases that act in the final stages of corpse processing following cell death. Indeed, a tomato KDEL-tailed cysteine proteinase, SlCysEP, was identified and its gene was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. SlCysEP transcript and protein were restricted to the anthers of the senescing tomato flower. Present in the interlocular septum and in the epidermal cells surrounding the stomium relatively early in development, SlCysEP accumulates later in the sporophytic tissues surrounding the locules as dehiscence ensues. At the ultrastuctural level, immunogold labeling localized SlCysEP to the ricinosomes within the cells of these tissues, but not in the tapetum. It is suggested that the accumulation of SlCysEP and the appearance of ricinosomes act as very early predictors of cell death in the tomato anther.",M1
19088092,"The Bax/Bak ortholog in Drosophila, Debcl, exerts limited control over programmed cell death.Bcl-2 family members are pivotal regulators of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). In mammals, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members initiate early apoptotic signals by causing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, a step necessary for the initiation of the caspase cascade. Worms and flies do not show a requirement for cytochrome c during apoptosis, but both model systems express pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Drosophila encodes two Bcl-2 family members, Debcl (pro-apoptotic) and Buffy (anti-apoptotic). To understand the role of Debcl in Drosophila apoptosis, we produced authentic null alleles at this locus. Although gross development and lifespans were unaffected, we found that Debcl was required for pruning cells in the developing central nervous system. debcl genetically interacted with the ced-4/Apaf1 counterpart dark, but was not required for killing by RHG (Reaper, Hid, Grim) proteins. We found that debcl(KO) mutants were unaffected for mitochondrial density or volume but, surprisingly, in a model of caspase-independent cell death, heterologous killing by murine Bax required debcl to exert its pro-apoptotic activity. Therefore, although debcl functions as a limited effector of PCD during normal Drosophila development, it can be effectively recruited for killing by mammalian members of the Bcl-2 gene family.",M1
19081535,"Programmed cell death in plants: new insights into redox regulation and the role of hydrogen peroxide.Programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), the highly regulated dismantling of cells, is essential for plant growth and survival. PCD plays key roles in embryo development, formation and maturation of many cell types and tissues, and plant reaction/adaptation to environmental conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not only toxic by products of aerobic metabolism with strictly controlled cellular levels, but they also function as signaling agents regulating many biological processes and producing pleiotropic effects. Over the last decade, ROS have become recognized as important modulators of plant PCD. Molecular genetic approaches using plant mutants and transcriptome studies related to ROS-mediated PCD have revealed a wide array of plant-specific cell death regulators and have contributed to unraveling the elaborate redox signaling network. This review summarizes the biological processes, in which plant PCD participates and discusses the signaling functions of ROS with emphasis on hydrogen peroxide.",M1
19077536,"The role of the RING-finger protein Elfless in Drosophila spermatogenesis and apoptosis.elfless (CG15150, FBgn0032660) maps to polytene region 36DE 5' (left) of reduced ocelli/Pray for Elves (PFE) on chromosome 2L and is predicted to encode a 187 amino acid RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is putatively involved in programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>, e.g., apoptosis). Several experimental approaches were used to characterize CG15150/elfless and test whether defects in this gene underlie the male sterile phenotype associated with overlapping chromosomal deficiencies of region 36DE. elfless expression is greatly enhanced in the testes and the expression pattern of UAS-elfless-EGFP driven by elfless-Gal4 is restricted to the tail cyst cell nuclei of the testes. Despite this, elfless transgenes failed to rescue the male sterile phenotype in Df/Df flies. Furthermore, null alleles of elfless, generated either by imprecise excision of an upstream P-element or by FLP-FRT deletion between two flanking piggyBac elements, are fertile. In a gain-of-function setting in the eye, we found that elfless genetically interacts with key members of the apoptotic pathway including the initiator caspase Dronc and the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcD1. DIAP1, but not UbcD1, protein levels are increased in heads of flies expressing Elfless-EGFP in the eye, and in testes of flies expressing elfless-Gal4 driven Elfless-EGFP. Based on these findings, we speculate that Elfless may regulate tail cyst cell degradation to provide an advantageous, though not essential, function in the testis.",M1
19066463,"Autophagy promotes caspase-dependent cell death during Drosophila development.The relationship between autophagic cell death and apoptosis is a poorly understood aspect of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). We have examined this relationship by studying the elimination of an extra-embryonic tissue, known as the amnioserosa (AS), during Drosophila development. The AS becomes autophagic during the final stages of embryogenesis; ultimately, however, the elimination of the AS involves caspase-dependent nuclear fragmentation, tissue dissociation and engulfment by phagocytic macrophages. Mutants that are defective in the activation or execution of caspase-dependent PCD fail to degrade and eliminate the AS but show no abatement in AS autophagy. Sustained autophagy does not, therefore, necessarily result in cell death. Surprisingly, the downregulation of autophagy also results in a persistent AS phenotype and reduced cell death. Conversely, upregulation of autophagy results in caspase-dependent premature AS dissociation. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that autophagy is a prerequisite for caspase-dependent cell death in the AS.",M1
19053945,"Mitochondrial calcium overload triggers complement-dependent superoxide-mediated programmed cell death in Trypanosoma cruzi.The epimastigote stage of Trypanosoma cruzi undergoes <e>PCD</e> (programmed cell death) when exposed to FHS (fresh human serum). Although it has been known for over 30 years that complement is responsible for FHS-induced death, the link between complement activation and triggering of PCD has not been established. We have previously shown that the mitochondrion participates in the orchestration of PCD in this model. Several changes in mitochondrial function were described, and in particular it was shown that mitochondrion-derived O(2)(*-) (superoxide radical) is necessary for PCD. In the present study, we establish mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload as the link between complement deposition and the observed changes in mitochondrial physiology and the triggering of PCD. We show that complement activation ends with the assembly of the MAC (membrane attack complex), which allows influx of Ca(2+) and release of respiratory substrates to the medium. Direct consequences of these events are accumulation of Ca(2+) in the mitochondrion and decrease in cell respiration. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) causes partial dissipation of the inner membrane potential and consequent mitochondrial uncoupling. Moreover, we provide evidence that mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload is responsible for the increased O(2)(*-) production, and that if cytosolic Ca(2+) rise is not accompanied by the accumulation of the cation in the mitochondrion and consequent production of O(2)(*-), epimastigotes die by necrosis instead of PCD. Thus our results suggest a model in which MAC assembly on the parasite surface allows Ca(2+) entry and its accumulation in the mitochondrion, leading to O(2)(*-) production, which in turn constitutes a PCD signal.",M1
19041363,"3-Nitrofluoranthene (3-NF) but not 3-aminofluoranthene (3-AF) elicits apoptosis as well as programmed necrosis in Hepa1c1c7 cells.In this study, we show that the environmental pollutant, 3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NF) but not its amine form, 3-aminofluoranthene (3-AF), induces apoptosis as well as regulated necrosis with necroptotic features in Hepa1c1c7 cells. Upon exposure to 3-NF, both typical apoptotic and necrotic cells were observed. A large number of the cells exhibited a characteristic partial nuclear chromatin condensation. Cycloheximide completely attenuated 3-NF-induced cell death. Activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 were observed. Moreover, Z-VAD-FMK decreased the apoptotic cells, whereas the number of propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells with partial chromatin condensation was reduced by Nec-1, an inhibitor of receptor interacting protein (RIP-1). Cyp1a1, but not nitric oxide synthase (NOS), appears to be involved in activation of 3-NF to reactive metabolites. Increase in the number as well as size of lysosomes, myelinosomes, and activation of autophagy were also observed. 3-NF induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPKs. Interestingly, while inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK reduced apoptotic as well as necrotic cell death, the p38 inhibitor, SB202190 reduced only the necrotic cell death. Taken together, 3-NF elicits both apoptosis and a caspase-independent programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) with autophagic characteristics. Conversely, with 3-AF, no apparent cytotoxic effects besides a reduction in cell proliferation was observed.",M1
19041319,"Intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ by the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone during programmed cell death in silkworm anterior silk glands.20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) triggers programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and regulates de novo gene expression in the anterior silk glands (ASGs) of the silkworm Bombyx mori. PCD is mediated via a nongenomic pathway that includes Ca2+ as a second messenger and the activation of protein kinase C/caspase-3-like protease; however, the steps leading to a concomitant buildup of intracellular Ca2+ are unknown. We employed pharmacological tools to identify the components of this pathway. ASGs were cultured in the presence of 1 microM 20E and one of the following inhibitors: a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) inhibitor, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) antagonist, and an L- or T-type Ca2+ channel blocker. The T-type Ca2+ channel blocker inhibited 20E-induced nuclear and DNA fragmentation; in contrast, PCD was induced by 20E in Ca2+-free medium, indicating that the source of Ca2+ is an intracellular reservoir. The IP3R antagonist inhibited nuclear and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that the endoplasmic reticulum may be the Ca2+ source. Finally, the GPCR and PLC inhibitors effectively blocked nuclear and DNA fragmentation. Our results indicate that 20E increases the intracellular level of Ca2+ by activating IP3R, and that this effect may be brought about by the serial activation of GPCR, PLC, and IP3.",M1
19036837,"InPSR26, a putative membrane protein, regulates programmed cell death during petal senescence in Japanese morning glory.The onset and progression of petal senescence, which is a type of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), are highly regulated. Genes showing changes in expression during petal senescence in Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil) were isolated and examined to elucidate their function in PCD. We show here that a putative membrane protein, InPSR26, regulates progression of PCD during petal senescence in Japanese morning glory. InPSR26 is dominantly expressed in petal limbs and its transcript level increases prior to visible senescence symptoms. Transgenic plants with reduced InPSR26 expression (PSR26r lines) showed accelerated petal wilting, with PCD symptoms including cell collapse, ion and anthocyanin leakage, and DNA degradation accelerated in petals compared to wild-type plants. Transcript levels of autophagy- and PCD-related genes (InATG4, InATG8, InVPE, and InBI-1) were reduced in the petals of PSR26r plants. Autophagy visualized by monodansylcadaverine staining confirmed that autophagy is induced in senescing petal cells of wild-type plants and that the percentage of cells containing monodansylcadaverine-stained structures, most likely autophagosomes, was significantly lower in the petals of PSR26r plants, indicating reduced autophagic activity in the PSR26r plants. These results suggest that InPSR26 acts to delay the progression of PCD during petal senescence, possibly through regulation of the autophagic process. Our data also suggest that autophagy delays PCD in petal senescence.",M1
19019992,"Neuronal programmed cell death induces glial cell division in the adult Drosophila brain.Although mechanisms that lead to programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in neurons have been analysed extensively, little is known about how surrounding cells coordinate with it. Here we show that neuronal PCD in the Drosophila brain induces glial cell division. We identified PCD in neurons and cell division in glia occurring in a consistent spatiotemporal manner in adult flies shortly after eclosion. Glial division was suppressed when neuronal PCD was inhibited by ectopic expression of the caspase inhibitor gene p35, indicating their causal relationship. Glia also responded to neural injury in a similar manner: both stab injury and degeneration of sensory axons in the brain caused by antennal ablation induced glial division. Eiger, a tumour necrosis factor superfamily ligand, appears to be a link between developmental PCD/neural injury and glial division, as glial division was attenuated in eiger mutant flies. Whereas PCD soon after eclosion occurred in eiger mutants as in the wild type, we observed excess neuronal PCD 2 days later, suggesting a protective function for Eiger or the resulting glial division against the endogenous PCD. In older flies, between 6 and 50 days after adult eclosion, glial division was scarcely observed in the intact brain. Moreover, 8 days after adult eclosion, glial cells no longer responded to brain injury. These results suggest that the life of an adult fly can be divided into two phases: the first week, as a critical period for neuronal cell death-associated glial division, and the remainder.",M1
19011643,"Inhibition of active nuclear transport is an intrinsic trigger of programmed cell death in trypanosomatids.The link between nucleocytoplasmic transport and apoptosis remains controversial. Nucleocytoplasmic exchange of molecules seems indeed essential for the initiation and execution of the apoptotic programme; but inhibition of nuclear transport factors may also represent a powerful apoptotic trigger. The GTPase Ran (together with its partners), first discovered to be essential in nucleocytoplasmic transport, has multiple key functions in cell biology, and particularly in spindle assembly, kinetochore function and nuclear envelope assembly. Among the Ran partners studied, NTF2 appears to be solely involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we localised Ran and several of its partners, RanBP1, CAS and NTF2, at the nuclear membrane in the trypanosomatid Leishmania major. Remarkably, these proteins fused to GFP decorated a perinuclear 'collar' of about 15 dots, colocalising at nuclear pore complexes with the homologue of nucleoporin Sec13. In the other trypanosomatid Trypanosoma brucei, RNAi knockdown of the expression of the corresponding genes resulted in an apoptosis-like phenomenon. These phenotypes show that Ran and its partners have a key function in trypanosomatids like they have in mammals. Our data, notably those about TbNTF2 RNAi, support the idea that active nucleocytoplasmic transport is not essential for the initiation and execution of apoptosis, and, rather, the impairment of this transport constitutes an intrinsic signal for triggering <e>PCD</e>.",M1
18989644,"Systemic <e>PCD</e> occurs in TMV-tomato interaction.In hypersensitive response (HR), programmed cell death (PCD) is reported as a powerful defense mechanism in plant immune responses to pathogen. However, little is known about the PCD in systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Using tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to infect the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Jiafen 16) we found that localized TMV-infection could induce cell death in the uninoculated parts of the tomatoes, where the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed no spreading virus. The biological and molecular characterization of this cell death was shown as following: chromatin condensed and formed peripheral conglomeration in nuclei; cell nucleus were TUNEL positive labeled; genomic DNA was fragmented and showed DNA laddering; mitochondria and chloroplast were disrupted; tonoplast and plasma membrane were shrunk and degradated. These results suggested that with an absence of TMV spread, the local TMV-infection on certain tomato leaves could induce systemic PCD in the root-tips, stem-apices and uninoculated leaves. The systemic PCD has various initiation and synchronization in such tissues and is distinct in inducement and exhibition from HR-PCD and SAR.",M1
18985425,"Evidence of ceased programmed cell death in metaphloem sieve elements in the developing caryopsis of Triticum aestivum L.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the metaphloem sieve elements (MSEs) in the ventral vascular bundle of the caryopses of developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) undergo a unique type of programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei were observed at 3 and 4 days after flowering (DAF). Transmission electron microscopy studies of differentiating MSEs revealed increased vacuolation, nuclear degeneration, chromatin condensation and localization to the periphery of the nucleus, and partly dilated perinuclear spaces, all typical characteristics of PCD in plant cells. In addition, vacuoles were disrupted at the last stages of differentiation. These results demonstrate that MSE differentiation is a unique type of PCD with highly selective autophagic processes, in which PCD ceases just prior to death. During this cessation of PCD, vacuoles and the endoplasmic reticulum appear to be associated with selective organelle digestion.",M1
18984040,"Enhanced sensitivity of midline glial cells to apoptosis is achieved by HOW(L)-dependent repression of Diap1.The selective sensitivity of cells to programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) depends on the positive and negative death-inducing signals that converge into the apoptotic pathway. In Drosophila, the midline glial (MG) cells undergo selective death during development. Here, we show that the long isoform of the RNA-binding protein Held Out Wing (HOW(L)) is essential for enhancing the sensitivity of the MG cells to PCD. In how mutant embryos, the number of MG cells was elevated. This phenotype could be rescued by midline expression of the HOW(L) repressor isoform. In how mutant embryos, the levels of the caspase inhibitor of apoptosis, Diap1 were elevated, in parallel to reduction in the levels of activated caspase. Similarly, reducing the levels of HOW in S2 cells led to elevation of Diap1, whereas over expression of HOW(L) promoted reduction of Diap1 protein as well as mRNA levels. Importantly, deletion of the two HOW binding sites from diap1 3'UTR abrogated HOW-dependent repression of Diap1, suggesting that HOW represses diap1 by binding to its 3'UTR. These results suggest that HOW(L) enhances the sensitivity of MG cells to apoptotic signals by reducing the levels of diap1 in these cells in, demonstrating a novel mode of regulation of PCD at the mRNA level.",M1
18950431,"Cell death upon H(2)O(2) induction in the unicellular green alga Micrasterias.In the present study, we investigated whether the unicellular green alga Micrasterias denticulata is capable of executing programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) upon experimental induction, and which morphological, molecular and physiological hallmarks characterise this. This is particularly interesting as unicellular freshwater green algae growing in shallow bog ponds are exposed to extreme environmental conditions, and the capacity to perform PCD may be an important strategy to guarantee survival of the population. The theoretically 'immortal' alga Micrasterias is an ideal object for such investigations as it has served as a cell biological model system for many years and details on its growth properties, physiology and ultrastructure throughout the cell cycle are well known. Treatments with low concentrations of H(2)O(2) are known to induce PCD in other organisms, resulting in severe ultrastructural changes to organelles, as observed in TEM. These include deformation and part disintegration of mitochondria, abnormal dilatation of cisternal rims of dictyosomes, occurrence of multivesicular bodies, an increase in the number of ER compartments, and slight condensation of chromatin. Additionally, a statistically significant increase in caspase-3-like activity was detected, which was abrogated by a caspase-3 inhibitor. Photosynthetic activity measured by fast chlorophyll fluorescence decreased as a consequence of H(2)O(2) exposure, whereas pigment composition, except for a reduction in carotenoids, was the same as in untreated controls. TUNEL positive staining and ladder-like degradation of DNA, both frequently regarded as a hallmark of PCD in higher plants, could only be detected in dead Micrasterias cells.",M1
18930906,"Sexual autophagic differences in the androgen-dependent flank organ of Syrian hamsters.The flank organ of the Syrian hamster shows a biodynamic response to androgenic stimulation and is, therefore, a suitable model for the study of androgenic effects on hair and sebaceous glands. This organ is susceptible to programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), a prominent feature associated with sexual organ adjustment. In the present report, the type of PCD (apoptosis or autophagy) exhibited by this organ was evaluated. Caspase-3 activity, indicative of apoptosis, was not detectable in flank organ homogenates. Furthermore, cytokeratins, which are normally degraded during apoptosis, remained intact. On the other hand, Western blotting of Beclin 1 and light chain 3-II, both important autophagy markers, revealed autophagic processes in the flank organ in both sexes, especially in females. Cathepsin D activity, higher in males than in females, and procathepsin D expression were also consistent with autophagy and not apoptosis. Taken together, these data indicate that macroautophagy, and not apoptosis, is the main mechanism by which the flank organ responds to androgen. This is the first direct evidence establishing the relationship between autophagy and morphological changes in androgen-dependent organs.",M1
18930441,"Myelin basic protein-specific T lymphocytes proliferation and programmed cell death in demyelinating diseases.A dynamic equilibrium between proliferation and programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) of auto-reactive T lymphocytes plays a pivotal role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. We analyzed T lymphocytes myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific PCD and proliferation in demyelinating diseases. Results showed that MBP-specific PCD was significantly decreased in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), not determined leukoencephalopathy (NDLE), and acute MS (AMS) patients compared to patients with stable MS (SMS) and healthy controls. MBP-specific proliferation/PCD rates were high in CD4+ T lymphocytes of PML, NDLE, and AMS patients, and in CD8+ T cells of PML and AMS individuals alone. Alterations of the balance between MBP-specific proliferation and PCD are present in demyelinating diseases and could play a major role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",M1
18926571,"Autophagic and apoptotic cell death in amniotic epithelial cells.The aim of this paper is to determine if autophagic cell death is associated with apoptosis and whether it participates in the process of term amniotic rupture. Forty pieces of fresh term amnions, including twenty from a position near the margin of the placentas and twenty from the margin of the naturally ruptured part of the placentas in term gestation were collected, respectively. The amnions were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and amniotic epithelial (AE) cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Autophagic and apoptotic cell death (<e>PCD</e>) were assayed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) or flow cytometry using monodansylcadaverin (MDC) and propidium iodide (PI) stain. BCL(2) and BAX were examined by immunoblotting. Under SEM the amniotic epithelia appeared normal in the position near the placenta. They had an atrophied appearance in the margin of their natural broken parts. In the AE cells PCD was divided into three subtypes by TEM: autophagic cell death with positive stains of MDC and PI; apoptotic cell death; and the mixed type. Quantitative detection showed that there were more death cells, including autophagic and apoptotic, in the AE cells near the ruptured parts than near the placentas. An increased expression of BAX and a decreased expression of BCL(2) protein in the AE cells near the broken margin were observed. Apoptotic and autophagic cell death by the intrinsic pathway are the basic event in the AE cell and they are involved in the cause of membrane rupture of the human amnion in term gestation.",M1
18852517,"Age- and area-dependent distinct effects of ethanol on Bax and Bcl-2 expression in prenatal rat brain.Cell proliferation and differentiation are critical processes in a developing fetal rat brain, during which programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) also plays an important role. One of the decisive factors for PCD is Bcl-2 family proteins, where Bax induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 acts as an inhibitor of PCD. As maternal drinking is known to cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or malformation of the fetal brain during pregnancy, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether maternal ethanol exposure alters the PCD-related Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression during fetal brain development. Pregnant female rats were orally treated with 10% ethanol and the subsequent expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins examined in the fetal brain, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, from gestational day (GD) 15.5 to GD 19.5, using Western blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. With regard to the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax proteins (Bcl-2/Bax), the Bax protein was dominant in the forebrain and midbrain of the control GD 15.5 fetuses, except for the hindbrain, when compared with the respective ethanol-treated groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 became dominant in the midbrain of the control GD 17.5 fetuses when compared with the ethanoltreated group, representing an alternation of the natural PCD process by ethanol. Furthermore, a differential expression of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was found in the differentiating and migrating zones of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Thus, when taken together, the present results suggest that ethanol affects PCD in the cell differentiation and migration zones of the prenatal rat brain by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression in an age- and area-dependent manner. Therefore, this is the first evidence that ethanol may alter FAS-associated embryonic brain development through the alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression.",M1
18833031,"Alkaloids induce programmed cell death in bloodstream forms of trypanosomes (Trypanosoma b. brucei).The potential induction of a programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) in Trypanosoma b. brucei by 55 alkaloids of the quinoline, quinolizidine, isoquinoline, indole, terpene, tropane, steroid, and piperidine type was studied by measuring DNA fragmentation and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. For comparison, the induction of apoptosis by the same alkaloids in human leukemia cells (Jurkat APO-S) was tested. Several alkaloids of the isoquinoline, quinoline, indole and steroidal type (berberine, chelerythrine, emetine, sanguinarine, quinine, ajmalicine, ergotamine, harmine, vinblastine, vincristine, colchicine, chaconine, demissidine and veratridine) induced programmed cell death, whereas quinolizidine, tropane, terpene and piperidine alkaloids were mostly inactive. Effective PCD induction (EC(50) below 10 microM) was caused in T. brucei by chelerythrine, emetine, sanguinarine, and chaconine. The active alkaloids can be characterized by their general property to inhibit protein biosynthesis, to intercalate DNA, to disturb membrane fluidity or to inhibit microtubule formation.",M1

These components can function as positive or negative regulators and can have contrasting functions depending on the form of cell death.",M1
18822349,"Quantitative analysis of activated caspase-3-positive cells and a circadian cycle of programmed cell death in the adult teleost retina.In adult teleosts, it has been shown that germinal cells proliferate in the marginal retina. Daughter cells also die in this region but the details of their death, presumably by programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>), are not fully known. In this study, we labeled cells undergoing PCD in the adult goldfish retina by an antibody to activated caspase-3. Most of the activated caspase-3-positive cells (caspase-3+ cells) were found at the primary growth zone in the retinal margin, 80-140 microm from the circular blood vessel, where their density was 518+/-65.3 cells/mm2 of the retinal surface (mean+/-S.D., n = 3) at midday and 395+/-47.4 cells/mm2 (n = 3) at midnight. Although the local densities of caspase-3+ cells in the primary growth zone in the day and night-time were significantly different, the mean densities of caspase-3+ cells in the retinal margin as a whole remained constant at 185+/-29.7 cells/mm2 (n = 16) during most of the day and night-time. However, immediately after light onset in the morning, the density of caspase-3+ cells in the retinal margin increased by 30%. This transient increase was also seen at the same objective time in goldfish that were kept in the dark for the entire day. Our quantitative study demonstrates that PCD in the marginal retina of the adult goldfish is induced in some parts by a caspase-3-dependent pathway and that it is also regulated by a circadian mechanism.",M1

The necessity of rituximab internalisation for CI-PCD induction was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy in human BL cell lines with (e.g. Mutu I) and without (Mutu III) susceptibility to rituximab-induced killing. Flow cytometry demonstrated small, significant and similar amounts of rituximab internalisation by Mutu I cells after 1, 2, 4 and 24 h (p &lt; 0.03, n = 5) and Mutu III cells after 0.5, 2, 4 and 24 h (p &lt; 0.05, n = 4). Confocal microscopy confirmed this. Cytochalasin B and latrunculin A significantly inhibited rituximab-induced CI-PCD (p &lt; or = 0.04, n = 6 and p = 0.01, n = 6, respectively) and internalisation (p = 0.02, n = 5 and p = 0.0002, n = 6, respectively) in Mutu I cells, but confocal microscopy showed no correlation between internalised rituximab and phosphatidylserine exposure. We conclude that rituximab internalisation is not essential for CI-PCD induction in BL cell lines.",M1
18725200,"Arabidopsis AAL-toxin-resistant mutant atr1 shows enhanced tolerance to programmed cell death induced by reactive oxygen species.The fungal AAL-toxin triggers programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) through perturbations of sphingolipid metabolism in AAL-toxin-sensitive plants. While Arabidopsis is relatively insensitive to the toxin, the loh2 mutant exhibits increased susceptibility to AAL-toxin due to the knockout of a gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Genetic screening of mutagenized loh2 seeds resulted in the isolation of AAL-toxin-resistant mutant atr1.Atr1 displays a wild type phenotype when grown on soil but it develops less biomass than loh2 on media supplemented with 2% and 3% sucrose. Atr1 was also more tolerant to the reactive oxygen species-generating herbicides aminotriazole (AT) and paraquat. Microarray analyses of atr1 and loh2 under AT-treatment conditions that trigger cell death in loh2 and no visible damage in atr1 revealed genes specifically regulated in atr1 or loh2. In addition, most of the genes strongly downregulated in both mutants were related to cell wall extension and cell growth, consistent with the apparent and similar AT-induced cessation of growth in both mutants. This indicates that two different pathways, a first controlling growth inhibition and a second triggering cell death, are associated with AT-induced oxidative stress.",M1
18723055,"The protection of Bcl-2 overexpression on rat cortical neuronal injury caused by analogous ischemia/reperfusion in vitro.Recent studies have suggested that neuronal apoptosis in cerebral ischemia could arise from dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (Bcl-2) has been described as an inhibitor both in programmed cell death (<e>PCD</e>) and ER dysfunction during apoptosis, and the Bcl-2 family play a key role in regulating the PCD, both locally at the ER and from a distance at the mitochondrial membrane. However, its signal pathways and concrete mechanisms in endoplasmic reticulum-initiated apoptosis remain incompletely understood. We therefore investigate whether ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) causes neuronal apoptosis in part via cross-talk between ER and mitochondria or not, and how the overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents this form of cell death. Here we show that analogous I/R-induced cell death occurs consequent to interactions of ER stress and mitochondrial death pathways. The participation of the mitochondrial pathway was demonstrated by the release of cytochrome C (cyt C) from mitochondrial into cytoplasmic fractions and caspase-9 cleavage. The involvement of ER stress was further supported by the observable increase of glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78)/BiP expression and caspase-12 activity. Furthermore, prior to these changes, swelling of the ER lumen and dissociation of ribosomes from rough ER were detected by electron microscopy. Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits the release of cyt C and the activation of caspase-9/-8/-3 but not caspase-12 based on the results of Western blot. These suggest that cross-talk between ER and mitochondria participate in neuronal damage after ischemia/reperfusion. Bcl-2 overexpression could suppress I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis via influencing mitochondrial integrity.",M1

The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotype and either specific ultrastructural ciliary defects identified by transmission electron microscopy or evidence of abnormal ciliary function. Although the management of children affected with PCD remains uncertain and evidence is limited, it remains important to follow-up these patients with an adequate and shared care system in order to prevent future lung damage. This European Respiratory Society consensus statement on the management of children with PCD formulates recommendations regarding diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in order to permit a more accurate approach in these patients.

Defects in motile cilia result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), the most prominent ciliopathy, characterized by the association of respiratory symptoms, male infertility, and, in nearly 50% of cases, situs inversus. So far, most identified disease-causing mutations involve genes encoding various ciliary components, such those belonging to the dynein arms that are essential for ciliary motion. Following a candidate-gene approach based on data from a mutant strain of the biflagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii carrying an ODA7 defect, we identified four families with a PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of both dynein arms and loss-of-function mutations in the human orthologous gene called LRRC50. Functional analyses performed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in another flagellated protist, Trypanosoma brucei, support a key role for LRRC50, a member of the leucine-rich-repeat superfamily, in cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein arms.",M2
19944400,"Deletions and point mutations of LRRC50 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia due to dynein arm defects.Genetic defects affecting motility of cilia and flagella cause chronic destructive airway disease, randomization of left-right body asymmetry, and, frequently, male infertility in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). The most frequent defects involve outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs) that are large multiprotein complexes responsible for cilia-beat generation and regulation, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that large genomic deletions, as well as point mutations involving LRRC50, are responsible for a distinct PCD variant that is characterized by a combined defect involving assembly of the ODAs and IDAs. Functional analyses showed that LRRC50 deficiency disrupts assembly of distally and proximally DNAH5- and DNAI2-containing ODA complexes, as well as DNALI1-containing IDA complexes, resulting in immotile cilia. On the basis of these findings, we assume that LRRC50 plays a role in assembly of distinct dynein-arm complexes.",M2
19921128,"[Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>Pcd</e>) in Austria]INTRODUCTION: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare hereditary recessive disease with symptoms of recurrent pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and chronic sinusitis. Chronic rhinitis is often the presenting symptom in newborns and infants. Approximately half of the patients show visceral mirror image arrangements (situs inversus). In this study, we aimed 1) to determine the number of paediatric PCD patients in Austria, 2) to show the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used in the clinical centres and 3) to describe symptoms of children with PCD. PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the first two aims, we analysed data from a questionnaire survey of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force on Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia in children. All paediatric respiratory units in Austria received a questionnaire. Symptoms of PCD patients from Vienna Children's University Hospital (aim 3) were extracted from case histories. RESULTS: In 13 Austrian clinics 48 patients with PCD (36 aged from 0-19 years) were identified. The prevalence of reported cases (aged 0-19 yrs) in Austria was 1:48000. Median age at diagnosis was 4.8 years (IQR 0.3-8.2), lower in children with situs inversus compared to those without (3.1 vs. 8.1 yrs, p = 0.067). In 2005-2006, the saccharine test was still the most commonly used screening test for PCD in Austria (45%). Confirmation of the diagnosis was usually by electron microscopy (73%). All clinics treated exacerbations immediately with antibiotics, 73% prescribed airway clearance therapy routinely to all patients. Other therapies and diagnostic tests were applied very inconsistently across Austrian hospitals. All PCD patients from Vienna (n = 13) had increased upper and lower respiratory secretions, most had recurring airway infections (n = 12), bronchiectasis (n = 7) and bronchitis (n = 7). CONCLUSION: Diagnosis and therapy of PCD in Austria are inhomogeneous. Prospective studies are needed to learn more about the course of the disease and to evaluate benefits and harms of different treatment strategies.",M2
19910612,"Diagnostic testing of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia.RATIONALE: Electron microscopy (EM) of ciliated epithelium is widely used to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) has been used to screen samples to determine whether EM is indicated. Beat pattern analysis has been advocated as an additional diagnostic test. Neither has been subject to formal review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of CBF and beat pattern analysis to predict EM-diagnosed PCD. METHODS: CBF calculation and beat pattern analysis, using high-speed video microscopy, and EM were performed on nasal tissue from 371 patients consecutively referred to the Leicester Royal Infirmary for diagnostic assessment for PCD. With EM as the  gold standard,  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated for CBF less than 11 Hz, ciliary dyskinesia score equal to or exceeding 2, at least 90% of ciliated edges beating dyskinetically, and an immotility index equal to or exceeding 10%. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCD was excluded in 270 patients and confirmed in 70 by EM. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for CBF less than 11 Hz were 87.1, 77.2, 50.0, and 95.8%, respectively. These values were higher for ciliary dyskinesia scores equal to or exceeding 2 (92.5, 97.6, 91.2, and 98.0%) and when at least 90% of ciliated edges were dyskinetic (97.1, 95.3, 84.6, and 99.2%). ROCs confirmed that the ciliary dyskinesia score and percentage of dyskinetic edges were superior screening indices compared with CBF and the immotility index. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CBF alone to screen which biopsies should have EM will result in a significant number of missed diagnoses. Ciliary beat pattern analysis is a more sensitive and specific test for PCD with higher PPV and NPV.",M2
19797134,"Health-related quality of life and unmet needs in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.Few studies have evaluated the quality of life of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). We sought to determine the health impact of the disease as well as the unmet needs in a large group of patients. Questionnaires were either posted or e-mailed to known patients with PCD and published online. Questionnaires included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 and a questionnaire that we produced to obtain information on age of diagnosis, symptoms and likely PCD-specific problems of these patients. 78 subjects (96% of those invited) answered all the questionnaires. Patients were diagnosed at a mean age of 9.4 yrs. Progressive worsening of the disease was observed and adherence to physiotherapy was found to be poor, particularly in adolescents and adults. Patients with the highest treatment burden had a worse quality of life. Over time patients become progressively less interested in treating their disease and adherence to treatment modalities decreases. PCD is associated with a progressive and continuous impact on the physical and mental health of the patients. Earlier identification of the patients and better strategies aimed at improving compliance with care are urgently needed.",M2
19770168,"Simplified cell culture method for the diagnosis of atypical primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) can be challenging, and it may be particularly difficult to distinguish primary ciliary disease from the secondary changes after infections. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate if nasal epithelial cells, obtained with nasal brushing instead of a biopsy, could be used in a culture system for the diagnosis of PCD in difficult cases. Methods and MAIN RESULTS: Ciliary motion analysis (CMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on 59 subjects with persistent or recurrent pneumonia. These investigations allowed the diagnosis of PCD in 13 (22%) patients while the defect of the cilia was considered secondary to infections in 37 (63%) subjects. In the remaining nine (15%) patients the diagnostic evaluation with CMA and TEM remained inconclusive. Ciliogenesis in culture allowed the diagnosis of PCD in four of these patients, it was indicative of a secondary defect in two subjects, and it was not helpful in the remaining three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Culture of cells obtained with brushing of the nasal turbinate is not a perfect test, nevertheless it may offer diagnostic help in doubtful cases of PCD.",M2
19720631,"High prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia in a British Asian population.Determining the prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) in different populations has proved difficult, with estimates varying between one in 4000 to one in 40,000. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of PCD in a well-defined highly consanguineous Asian population in the UK. Over a 15-year period all patients suspected of having PCD in the Asian population of Bradford, UK, were tested by measurement of ciliary beat pattern, frequency and electron microscopy. The prevalence of PCD in the population studied was one in 2265. 52% of the patients' parents were first cousins. All patients had a history of chronic cough and nasal symptoms from the first year of life. 73% had a history of neonatal respiratory distress. Clinical suspicion of PCD should be high in populations in which it is possible that high levels of consanguinity may result in an increase in those with PCD. In these communities the combination of chronic cough and nasal symptoms should prompt early diagnostic testing.",M2
19675306,"Conditional deletion of dnaic1 in a murine model of primary ciliary dyskinesia causes chronic rhinosinusitis.Studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model because disruption of essential ciliary genes in mice results in a high incidence of lethal hydrocephalus. To develop a viable mouse model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1, are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA, and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6 months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD.",M2
19648518,"Disrupted ciliated epithelium shows slower ciliary beat frequency and increased dyskinesia.Ciliary function studies for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) are usually performed on nasal brush biopsy samples. It is not uncommon to find disrupted epithelial strips of tissue in these samples, and occasionally throughout a sample. The aim of the present study was to determine if cilia on disrupted ciliated epithelial edges beat with a normal pattern and frequency similar to that of cilia on undisrupted edges. Nasal brush biopsy samples from 42 children in whom the diagnosis of PCD was excluded were assessed. The epithelial strips were categorised into five groups: intact undisrupted ciliated epithelial edge, ciliated epithelial edge with minor projections, ciliated epithelial edge with major projections, an isolated ciliated cell on an epithelial edge and single unattached ciliated cells. Ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern of 50 samples from each group were determined using high speed digital video microscopy. The cilia on epithelial edges with varying degrees of disruption showed significantly reduced beat frequency and significantly increased dyskinesia compared with those on intact, undisrupted ciliated epithelial edges. Ideally, the assessment of ciliary beat pattern and frequency for PCD diagnosis should only be performed on undisrupted ciliated edges.",M2
19410203,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia: prospects for new therapies, building on the experience in cystic fibrosis.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetic disease associated with abnormal ciliary structure and function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance, an important primary innate defense mechanism that protects the lungs. Drugs that can effectively treat PCD should overcome the defect in ciliary function and increase the mucociliary clearance. However, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that correct the inborn error of ciliary dysfunction to restore mucociliary clearance. It is unclear if osmolar agents like hypertonic saline or mannitol, therapies that increase the respiratory surface hydration like ion-channel regulators, or therapies aimed at reducing inflammation or mucus production, or softening the mucus will be effective in PCD. Many of these modalities are used in cystic fibrosis, yet no evidence exists to support their routine use in PCD. Newer genetic modifiers show an exciting potential for personalized medication, combining selection of patients with a common genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation, and will greatly enhance the therapeutic arsenal for PCD. This review summarizes current and future prospects for these therapeutic options.",M2
19410202,"Management of primary ciliary dyskinesia: the lower airways.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetic disease associated with defective ciliary structure and function. Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.",M2
19357118,"Mutations in DNAH5 account for only 15% of a non-preselected cohort of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is characterised by recurrent infections of the upper respiratory airways (nose, bronchi, and frontal sinuses) and randomisation of left-right body asymmetry. To date, PCD is mainly described with autosomal recessive inheritance and mutations have been found in five genes: the dynein arm protein subunits DNAI1, DNAH5 and DNAH11, the kinase TXNDC3, and the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator RPGR. METHODS: We screened 89 unrelated individuals with PCD for mutations in the coding and splice site regions of the gene DNAH5 by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing. Patients were mainly of European origin and were recruited without any phenotypic preselection. RESULTS: We identified 18 novel (nonsense, splicing, small deletion and missense) and six previously described mutations. Interestingly, these DNAH5 mutations were mainly associated with outer + inner dyneins arm ultrastructural defects (50%). CONCLUSION: Overall, mutations on both alleles of DNAH5 were identified in 15% of our clinically heterogeneous cohort of patients. Although genetic alterations remain to be identified in most patients, DNAH5 is to date the main PCD gene.",M2
19300264,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia: improving the diagnostic approach.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) has relied on analysis of ciliary motility and ultrastructure; however, these tests are not readily available and have not been standardized. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCD may be delayed or missed or made incorrectly. This review outlines the potential utility of new diagnostic tests, including measurement of nasal nitric oxide production and systematic analysis for mutations in genes encoding ciliary proteins. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical manifestations of PCD have been expanded to include neonatal respiratory distress and heterotaxy. Measurement of nasal nitric oxide has emerged as a useful screening test for PCD based on the very low levels in PCD (approximately 1/10 of normal values). Genetic testing is emerging for PCD and demonstrates extensive genetic heterogeneity. Some genes and gene mutations involved in PCD have been defined. Approximately one-third of PCD cases have identifiable gene mutations in one of six different genes. An international effort is focused on defining PCD-causing defects in other genes. SUMMARY: The incorporation of nasal nitric oxide measurement as a screening test to define probable PCD cases and gene mutation analysis to make a definitive diagnosis of PCD should enhance diagnostic evaluation of PCD.",M2
19200523,"Mutations in radial spoke head protein genes RSPH9 and RSPH4A cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with central-microtubular-pair abnormalities.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited disorder arising from dysmotility of motile cilia and sperm. This is associated with a variety of ultrastructural defects of the cilia and sperm axoneme that affect movement, leading to clinical consequences on respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance and lung function, fertility, and left-right body-axis determination. We performed whole-genome SNP-based linkage analysis in seven consanguineous families with PCD and central-microtubular-pair abnormalities. This identified two loci, in two families with intermittent absence of the central-pair structure (chromosome 6p21.1, Zmax 6.7) and in five families with complete absence of the central pair (chromosome 6q22.1, Zmax 7.0). Mutations were subsequently identified in two positional candidate genes, RSPH9 on chromosome 6p21.1 and RSPH4A on chromosome 6q22.1. Haplotype analysis identified a common ancestral founder effect RSPH4A mutation present in UK-Pakistani pedigrees. Both RSPH9 and RSPH4A encode protein components of the axonemal radial spoke head. In situ hybridization of murine Rsph9 shows gene expression restricted to regions containing motile cilia. Investigation of the effect of knockdown or mutations of RSPH9 orthologs in zebrafish and Chlamydomonas indicate that radial spoke head proteins are important in maintaining normal movement in motile,  9+2 -structure cilia and flagella. This effect is rescued by reintroduction of gene expression for restoration of a normal beat pattern in zebrafish. Disturbance in function of these genes was not associated with defects in left-right axis determination in humans or zebrafish.",M2
19182755,"Kartagener's Syndrome.Kartagener's Syndrome or Immotile Cilia Syndrome, a variant of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by defect in the tiny hair like structure, the cilia lining the respiratory tract (upper and lower), sinuses, eustachian tubes, middle ear and fallopian tubes. Here electron microscopy shows abnormal arrangement of ciliary tubules and patients with Kartagener's syndrome has an absence of dynein arms at the base of the cilia. The inability of cilia to move results in inadequate clearance of bacteria from the air passages, resulting in an increased risk of infection and causing bronchiectasis. Another result of ciliary immobility is infertility. A 60 years old lady was diagnosed as a case of Kartagener's syndrome. She had history of chronic cough for 20 years, irregular fever for 20 years and occasional shortness of breath for 5 years. Relevant investigations revealed dextrocardia, situs inversus, bilateral maxillary sinusitis with non pneumatised frontal sinus and bronchiectasis. She was treated with low concentration oxygen inhalation, antibiotic, bronchodilator, chest physiotherapy including postural drainage, vitamins and other supportive treatment.",M2
19117740,"Bronchial and peripheral airway nitric oxide in primary ciliary dyskinesia and bronchiectasis.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetic condition resulting in bronchiectasis. Exhaled gas nitric oxide (FE(NO)) is reduced in PCD. A model of pulmonary NO exchange dynamics can be used to demonstrate relative contributions of bronchial (J'aw(NO)) and peripheral airway (Calv(NO)) NO to the final FE(NO) concentration. The aim of this study was to compare bronchial and peripheral airway contribution to FE(NO) in patients with PCD, non-PCD bronchiectasis and healthy controls in order to establish the source of present FE(NO) in these conditions and to compare these with severity of disease. NO was measured at 50, 100, and 200 ml/s using an NO analyser (NiOx Sweden). J'aw(NO) and Calv(NO) were calculated according to a model of pulmonary exchange dynamics. PCD patients had reduced levels of J'aw(NO) compared to healthy controls whereas patients with non-PCD bronchiectasis had elevated J'aw(NO) levels. There was no difference in Calv(NO) between the three groups. In the disease groups Calv(NO) correlated negatively with FEV(1). In conclusion patients with PCD had significantly reduced FE(NO) at all expiratory flow rates. This was due to a significantly low bronchial NO. In contrast, peripheral airway NO was increased with more severe disease.",M2
19102079,"[Recurrent respiratory infections with severely damaged lung functions--Kartagener's syndrome--case report]INTRODUCTION: Kartagener's (or Siewert) syndrome represents a clinical presentation of primary ciliary diskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) with 3 dominant symptoms: bronchiectasiae, chronic sinusitis and situs viscerum inversus totalis or dextrocardia, only. Siewet demonstrated the first case of this clinical phenomenon in 1904, which was recognized by Kartagener in 1933, as a congenital disorder. PCD is an autosomal recessive disease with extensive genetic heterogenity. Dyskinetic or completely absent motiliy of cilia predisposes to recurrent pulmonary and upper respiratory tract infections resulting in bronchiestasis. Also, infections of the middle ear are common due to lack of ciliary movement in the Eustachian tube. Men have reduced fertility due to spermatozoa with absent motility or abnormalities in the ductuli efferentes. CASE REPORT: Our case report represents a middle age woman, treated ambulatory for many years as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient noted recurrent upper respiratory tract infections from her childhood, headaches and recurrent sinusitis. Also, she had extrauterine pregnancy, no children, in spite of several arteficial inseminations. Due to the clinical signs of the right heart failure and the described ECG changes, the echocardiographic examination was done, which showed the dextracardia and the ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed the situs inversus, the finding being within the physiological limits. CONCLUSION: All data regarding situs viscerum invesrus, supported by CT verification of bronchiectasiae and chronic inflammation of maxillar sinus led us to conclude that the patient suffered from Kartagener's syndrome.",M2

18975248,"[Diagnostics of primary ciliary dyskinesia]Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and impaired mucociliary clearance. The prevalence of PCD is approximately 1 : 15 000 - 1 : 20 000 in live births. Cilia dysfunction is also implicated in a wider spectrum of diseases due to impaired organ genesis and body symmetry. Cilia are highly conserved in animals and show complex structures containing more than 250 proteins for their formation. Recent studies have begun to locate the PCD genes in the genome and characterize functional mutations. Specific diagnosis of the ciliary dysfunction requires physiological measurements as well as light- and electron microscopy. Abnormalities in ciliary motion and ultrastructural studies can be performed with nasal mucosal epithelium.",M2
18950741,"DNAI2 mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with defects in the outer dynein arm.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by chronic destructive airway disease and randomization of left/right body asymmetry. Males often have reduced fertility due to impaired sperm tail function. The complex PCD phenotype results from dysfunction of cilia of the airways and the embryonic node and the structurally related motile sperm flagella. This is associated with underlying ultrastructural defects that frequently involve the outer dynein arm (ODA) complexes that generate cilia and flagella movement. Applying a positional and functional candidate-gene approach, we identified homozygous loss-of-function DNAI2 mutations (IVS11+1G &gt; A) in four individuals from a family with PCD and ODA defects. Further mutational screening of 105 unrelated PCD families detected two distinct homozygous mutations, including a nonsense (c.787C &gt; T) and a splicing mutation (IVS3-3T &gt; G) resulting in out-of-frame transcripts. Analysis of protein expression of the ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 showed sublocalization throughout respiratory cilia. Electron microscopy showed that mutant respiratory cells from these patients lacked DNAI2 protein expression and exhibited ODA defects. High-resolution immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated absence of the ODA heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 from all DNAI2 mutant ciliary axonemes. In addition, we demonstrated complete or distal absence of DNAI2 from ciliary axonemes in respiratory cells of patients with mutations in genes encoding the ODA chains DNAH5 and DNAI1, respectively. Thus, DNAI2 and DNAH5 mutations affect assembly of proximal and distal ODA complexes, whereas DNAI1 mutations mainly disrupt assembly of proximal ODA complexes.",M2
18776131,"Mutation of murine adenylate kinase 7 underlies a primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotype.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder, characterized by progressive development of bronchiectasis, inflammation, and features characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report here that a murine mutation of the evolutionarily conserved adenylate kinase 7 (Ak7) gene results in animals presenting with pathological signs characteristic of PCD, including ultrastructural ciliary defects and decreased ciliary beat frequency in respiratory epithelium. The mutation is associated with hydrocephalus, abnormal spermatogenesis, mucus accumulation in paranasal passages, and a dramatic respiratory pathology upon allergen challenge. Ak7 appears to be a marker for cilia with (9 + 2) microtubular organization. This is suggested by its tissue specificity of expression and also the stringent conservation of Ak7 ortholog structure only in protozoans and metazoans possessing motile (9 + 2) cilia. Collectively, our results indicate an ancestral and crucial role of Ak7 in maintaining ciliary structure and function, and suggest that mutations of the human ortholog may underlie a subset of genetically uncharacterized PCD cases.",M2
18492703,"Mutations in dynein genes in patients affected by isolated non-syndromic asthenozoospermia.BACKGROUND: Asthenozoospermia (AZS) is a common cause of male infertility characterized by reduced forward motility (WHO grade A+B sperm motility &lt;50% or A &lt; 25%) or absent sperm motility in fresh ejaculate. AZS may exist as an isolated disorder, in combination with other sperm anomalies or as part of a syndromic association. Up to date, only a few genes, constituting the cilia/flagella structure, have been associated with isolated AZS in humans, whereas several other genes are known to be involved in syndromic form of AZS, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) and Kartagener syndrome (KS). Axonemal ultrastructural defects, including absent or shortened arms of dyneins, can be found in &gt;50% of PCD/KS patients. Approximately 90% of KS male patients are affected by AZS. The majority of KS patients can be ascribed to dynein genes mutations. METHODS: Mutation screening of DNAI1, DNAH5 and DNAH11 genes was performed in 90 patients with isolated non-syndromic AZS and 200 controls. RESULTS: We found three mutations (one in each gene) specifically associated with AZS in seven patients (7.8%). Mutations are inherited from the mothers and may be found in familial clusters. No ultrastructural axonemal anomaly was detected in sperm. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time a possible association between mutations in dynein genes and isolated AZS. Male carriers of the mutations always exhibit AZS, whereas female carriers manifest no alterations in either fertility or pulmonary clearance.",M2

18434704,"DNAI1 mutations explain only 2% of primary ciliary dykinesia.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a rare recessive hereditary disorder characterized by dysmotility to immotility of ciliated and flagellated structures. Its main symptoms are respiratory, caused by defective ciliary beating in the epithelium of the upper airways (nose, bronchi and paranasal sinuses). Impairing the drainage of inhaled microorganisms and particles leads to recurrent infections and pulmonary complications. To date, 5 genes encoding 3 dynein protein arm subunits (DNAI1, DNAH5 and DNAH11), the kinase TXNDC3 and the X-linked RPGR have been found to be mutated in PCD. OBJECTIVES: We proposed to determine the impact of the DNAI1 gene on a cohort of unrelated PCD patients (n = 104) recruited without any phenotypic preselection. METHODS: We used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing to screen for mutations in the coding and splicing site sequences of the gene DNAI1. RESULTS: Three mutations were identified: a novel missense variant (p.Glu174Lys) was found in 1 patient and 2 previously reported variants were identified (p.Trp568Ser in 1 patient and IVS1+2_3insT in 3 patients). Overall, mutations on both alleles of gene DNAI1 were identified in only 2% of our clinically heterogeneous cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that DNAI1 gene mutation is not a common cause of PCD, and that major or several additional disease gene(s) still remain to be identified before a sensitive molecular diagnostic test can be developed for PCD.",M2
18403663,"Structural and functional lung disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: High-resolution CT (HRCT) scan data on primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) related lung disease are scarce. STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the lung disease in children and adults with PCD by a modified Brody composite HRCT scan score to assess the prevalence of the structural abnormalities; to evaluate the correlation among HRCT scan scores, spirometry findings, and clinical data; and to compare the PCD scores with those of age-matched and sex-matched cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty PCD patients (age range, 4.6 to 27.5 years) underwent HRCT scanning, spirometry, and deep throat or sputum culture. A modified Brody score was used to assess bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, peribronchial thickening, parenchyma abnormalities, and mosaic perfusion. RESULTS: The total HRCT scan score was 6% of the maximal score (range, 0.5 to 25.5). Subscores were as follows: bronchiectasis, 5.6%; mucous plugging, 5.6%; peribronchial thickening, 8.3%; parenchyma, 3%; and mosaic perfusion, 0%. The prevalence of lung changes were as follows: bronchiectasis, 80%; peribronchial thickening, 80%; mucous plugging, 75%; parenchyma, 65%; and mosaic perfusion, 45%. Sixteen of 19 PCD patients had positive culture findings, and the most common pathogen found was Haemophilus influenzae (84%). The total HRCT scan score was significantly related to age (p = 0.006), FEV(1) (p = 0.02), and FVC (p = 0.02). The bronchiectasis subscore was significantly related to FEV(1) (p = 0.04) and FVC (p = 0.03). In CF patients, the total HRCT scan score was significantly higher than that in PCD patients (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: PCD patients show significantly lower pulmonary HRCT scan scores than CF patients. The PCD total and bronchiectasis scores correlate with spirometry findings. The PCD HRCT scan score might be used for longitudinal assessment and/or represent an outcome surrogate in future studies.",M2

DNAH5 and DNAI1 are involved in 28 and 10% of PCD cases, respectively, while two other genes, DNAH11 and TXNDC3, have been identified as causal in one PCD family each. We have previously identified a 3.5 cM (2.82 Mb) region on chromosome 15q linked to Kartagener syndrome (KS), a subtype of PCD characterized by the randomization of body organ positioning. We have now refined the KS candidate region to a 1.8 Mb segment containing 18 known genes. The coding regions of these genes and three neighboring genes were subjected to sequence analysis in seven KS probands, and we were able to identify 60 single nucleotide sequence variants, 35 of which resided in mRNA coding sequences.

All these reports used the aspiration nNO method. The goal of this study was to evaluate nNO in patients with PCD using different methods of NO measurement, including continuous aspiration, silent exhalation, and single-breath humming exhalation, which increases NO wash-out from the paranasal sinuses to the nose. MATERIAL/METHODS: Fourteen patients with established diagnosis of PCD and 14 healthy controls (HC) were examined. Oral and nasal NO levels were measured by chemiluminescence. Each subject performed NO measurement in triplicate during oral exhalation, nasal aspiration (nNOasp), nasal exhalation (nNOexh), and single-breath humming (nNOhum). RESULTS: The median nNOasp value (95% confidence interval) was 11.6 (7.2-19.1) ppb in PCD and 321.8 (270.6-510.6) ppb in HC (p&lt;0.001). The nNOexh value was 2.2 (1.3-3.1) in PCD and 31.8 (26.6-47.2) ppb in HC (p&lt;0.001). Patients with PCD had lower nNO than HC during the last 80% of the exhalation throughout humming, i.e. 2.8 (2.2-4.3) ppb vs. 212.4 (158.7-244.8) ppb (p&lt;0.001), and did not show a clear nNO peak. All nasal NO measurements had excellent specificity and sensitivity in detecting PCD compared with the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: nNO is consistently low in PCD with good specificity and sensitivity whatever the method used for NO measurement. The extremely low levels of nNO during humming support the notion that NO is defective in the paranasal sinuses in PCD.",M2
18201450,"Nasal scraping in diagnosing ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a congenital, clinically and ultrastructurally heterogeneous disease caused by abnormal structure and/or function of cilia. Kartagener's syndrome is one subgroup of PCD. Acquired ciliary dyskinesia is frequent, generally being associated with or following respiratory tract infections. METHODS: From January 2003 to April 2006, nasal mucociliary transport time was measured in 64 patients and specimens obtained by nasal scraping were examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). RESULTS: The 64 nasal scrapings led to the diagnosis of 11 (17.2%) cases of PCD and 51 (79.7%) cases of secondary ciliary disorder. In two cases (3.1%) no clear diagnosis was possible. CONCLUSION: Nasal scraping is an easy, cheap, and efficient tool for detecting ciliary abnormalities by TEM and for distinguishing acquired and congenital modifications.",M2
18187313,"Nasal nitric oxide for early diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia: practical issues in children.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetic disease characterized by abnormally beating cilia. In these patients, levels of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) are lower than those observed in healthy subjects. OBJECTIVES: We identify the nNO levels in healthy pre-school uncooperative children and in PCD patients, in order the application of nNO measurement in the early identification of young children with PCD. METHODS: We measured nNO in 77 healthy children (50 uncooperative and 27 cooperative) and in 10 PCD patients. Fifteen cooperative healthy children were also asked to perform an uncooperative test. RESULTS: PCD patients presented low nNO levels (29.7+/-5.7 ppb) compared to those observed in healthy children (358.8+/-35.2 ppb; p&lt;0.05). nNO levels were increased in healthy cooperative children (650+/-60.6 ppb; p&lt;0.05) as compared to those uncooperative aging more than 6 month (309.1+/-45.9 ppb; p&lt;0.05) or less (128.1+/-16.2 ppb; p&lt;0.05). Twenty-four uncooperative children with nNO values &lt; or = 200 ppb performed a second evaluation at least 6 months later and mean levels increased from 104.7+/-10.5 ppb to 169.9+/-19.6 ppb (p&lt;0.05). In the 15 collaborative children nNO levels were higher during the breath holding manoeuvre (687.7+/-96.9 ppb) than during the tidal breathing manoeuvre (335.9+/-57.9 ppb; p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy children have higher nNO levels than PCD patients. In 15% of uncooperative healthy children can be found low nNO levels, similar to PCD patients, but those values increased some months later, in successive evaluations. Nasal NO may be used for PCD screening even though repeated evaluations may be necessary in young children.",M2
18039845,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia in mice lacking the novel ciliary protein Pcdp1.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) results from ciliary dysfunction and is commonly characterized by sinusitis, male infertility, hydrocephalus, and situs inversus. Mice homozygous for the nm1054 mutation develop phenotypes associated with PCD. On certain genetic backgrounds, homozygous mutants die perinatally from severe hydrocephalus, while mice on other backgrounds have an accumulation of mucus in the sinus cavity and male infertility. Mutant sperm lack mature flagella, while respiratory epithelial cilia are present but beat at a slower frequency than wild-type cilia. Transgenic rescue demonstrates that the PCD in nm1054 mutants results from the loss of a single gene encoding the novel primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (Pcdp1). The Pcdp1 gene is expressed in spermatogenic cells and motile ciliated epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry shows that Pcdp1 protein localizes to sperm flagella and the cilia of respiratory epithelial cells and brain ependymal cells in both mice and humans. This study demonstrates that Pcdp1 plays an important role in ciliary and flagellar biogenesis and motility, making the nm1054 mutant a useful model for studying the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of PCD.",M2
18026660,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia: considerations regarding six cases of Kartagener syndrome.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), previously known as immotile cilia syndrome, is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that includes various patterns of ciliary ultrastructural defects. The most serious form is Kartagener syndrome (KS), which accounts for 50% of all cases of PCD. The incidence of PCD ranges from 1:20,000 to 1:60,000. Since PCD causes deficiency or even stasis of the transport of secretions throughout the respiratory tract, it favors the growth of viruses and bacteria. As a result, patients have lifelong chronic and recurrent infections, typically suffering from bronchitis, pneumonia, hemoptysis, sinusitis, and infertility. Bronchiectasis and other chronic conditions infections can be the end result of the irreversible bronchial alterations, leading to chronic cor pulmonale and its consequences. Only half of the patients affected by PDC present all of the symptoms, a condition designated complete KS, compared with incomplete KS, typically defined as cases in which situs inversus does not occur. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed through transmission electron microscopy. Since there is no specific therapy for PCD, it is recommended that, upon diagnosis, secondary infections be treated with potent antibiotics and prophylactic interventions be implemented. In this paper, we report six cases of PCD (five cases of complete KS and one case of KS) and review the related literature, focusing on the diagnostic, therapeutic and clinical aspects of this disease.",M2
18022865,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with normal axoneme ultrastructure is caused by DNAH11 mutations.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is an inherited disorder characterized by perturbed or absent beating of motile cilia, which is referred to as Kartagener syndrome (KS) when associated with situs inversus. We present a German family in which five individuals have PCD and one has KS. PCD was confirmed by analysis of native and cultured respiratory ciliated epithelia with high-speed video microscopy. Respiratory ciliated cells from the affected individuals showed an abnormal nonflexible beating pattern with a reduced cilium bending capacity and a hyperkinetic beat. Interestingly, the axonemal ultrastructure of these respiratory cilia was normal and outer dynein arms were intact, as shown by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite analysis indicated genetic linkage to the dynein heavy chain DNAH11 on chromosome 7p21. All affected individuals carried the compound heterozygous DNAH11 mutations c.12384C&gt;G and c.13552_13608del. Both mutations are located in the C-terminal domain and predict a truncated DNAH11 protein (p.Y4128X, p.A4518_A4523delinsQ). The mutations described here were not present in a cohort of 96 PCD patients. In conclusion, our findings support the view that DNAH11 mutations indeed cause PCD and KS, and that the reported DNAH11 nonsense mutations are associated with a normal axonemal ultrastructure and are compatible with normal male fertility.",M2
17765464,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia in the paediatric population: range and severity of radiological findings in a cohort of patients receiving tertiary care.AIM: To investigate the clinical range and severity of radiological findings in a cohort of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) receiving tertiary care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The case notes and clinical test results of 89 children attending the paediatric respiratory disease clinic at our institution were retrospectively analysed. Demographic details including age at diagnosis and common presenting signs and symptoms were studied. Results of chest radiographs, microscopy, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for quantification of lung damage were analysed. RESULTS: In a cohort of 89 children with PCD, a presentation chest radiograph was available in 62% of patients (n=55), with all but one demonstrating changes of bronchial wall thickening. HRCT of the lungs, available in 26 patients, were scored using the system described by Brody et al. analysing five specific features of lung disease, including bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, peribronchial thickening, parenchymal changes of consolidation, and ground-glass density, and focal air-trapping in each lobe. Peribronchial thickening was observed using HRCT in 25 patients, while 20 patients had bronchiectasis. Severity scores were highest for the middle and the lingular lobes. CONCLUSION: The radiographic findings of the largest reported cohort of patients with PCD are presented, with associated clinical findings. Dextrocardia remains the commonest finding on chest radiography. HRCT demonstrates peribronchial thickening and bronchiectasis, which is most marked in the lower zones. Radiological scoring techniques developed for assessment of cystic fibrosis can also be applied for the assessment of disease severity in this patient population.",M2
17722051,"Nitric oxide production in <e>PCD</e>: possible evidence for differential nitric oxide synthase function.Primary cilliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by decreased levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), thought to reflect low activity of airway inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. Alveolar NO (Calv) concentration and bronchial NO (JNO) flux can be calculated from FeNO measured at multiple exhalation flow rates. We hypothesised that whereas bronchial NO would be reduced in PCD due to reduced iNOS function, alveolar NO would reflect endothelial NOS (eNOS) function and be normal. We recorded the medical history; measured FeNO at multiple flow rates (50, 100, 200, 260 ml/sec); and performed spirometry in 24 children (aged 8-16 years). FeNO50 of the PCD children was significantly lower than normal mean (+/-SD) 8.1 +/- 1.3 ppb versus 12.5 +/- 1.6 ppb, P = 0.033. The mean +/- SD values of PCD (n = 24) and normal (n = 20) subjects were respectively: JNO: 383.5 +/- 307.9 versus 650.1 +/- 489 pl/s, P = 0.033, Calv: 1.60 +/- 0.78 versus 1.60 +/- 0.75 ppb, P = NS. We show that Calv is normal in PCD, demonstrating that there is no generalized disorder of NO handling in this condition. This differs from a previous report. Furthermore, we speculate that these data may provide supportive evidence that variable flow NO measurements can assess the relative activity of iNOS and eNOS.",M2
17634184,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia: current state of the art.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is usually inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder and presents with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and mirror image arrangement in around 50% of cases. Cilia dysfunction is also implicated in a wider spectrum of disease, including polycystic liver and kidney disease, central nervous system problems including retinopathy and hydrocephalus, and biliary atresia. Cilia are complex structures, containing more than 250 proteins; recent studies have begun to locate PCD genes scattered throughout the genome. Screening tests for PCD include nasal nitric oxide and in vivo tests of ciliary motility such as the saccharin test. Specific diagnosis requires examination of cilia by light and electron microscopy, with epithelial culture in doubtful cases. This is only available in supra-regional centres, recently centrally funded by the National Commissioning Group. Treatment is not evidence based and recommendations are largely extrapolated from cystic fibrosis and other suppurative lung diseases.",M2

17534128,"Genetic causes of bronchiectasis: primary ciliary dyskinesia.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder reflecting abnormalities in the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella, causing impairment of mucociliary clearance, left-right body asymmetry, and sperm motility. Clinical manifestations include respiratory distress in term neonates, recurrent otosinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, situs inversus and/or heterotaxy, and male infertility. Genetic discoveries are emerging from family-based linkage studies and from testing candidate genes. Mutations in 2 genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5, frequently cause PCD as an autosomal recessive disorder. A clinical genetic test has been recently established for DNAI1 and DNAH5, which involves sequencing 9 exons that harbor the most common mutations. This approach will identify at least one mutation in these 2 genes in approximately 25% of PCD patients. If biallelic mutations are identified, the test is diagnostic. If only one mutation is identified, the full gene may be sequenced to search for a trans-allelic mutation. As more disease-causing gene mutations are identified, broader genetic screening panels will further identify patients with PCD. Ongoing investigations are beginning to identify genetic mutations in novel clinical phenotypes for PCD, such as congenital heart disease and male infertility, and new associations are being established between 'ciliary' genetic mutations and clinical phenotypes.",M2
17534048,"Mucociliary transport in chronic rhinosinusitis.In conclusion, this chapter provides a review of paranasal sinus anatomy and discusses the physiology of mucociliary transport and abnormalities observed in patients with CRS. Normal mucociliary transport is essential for the maintenance of healthy sinuses. This is well illustrated by <e>PCD</e> in which a congenital abnormality in ciliary function leads to, among other manifestations, CRS and bronchiectasis. A decrease in mucociliary clearance has been demonstrated in most studies of CRS, with the bulk of evidence suggesting that the decrease is secondary rather than a primary event. Mucostasis, hypoxia, microbial products, and mediators and toxic proteins generated during chronic inflammation probably all contribute to diminished mucociliary function. These factors decrease mucociliary function by direct toxic effects on cilia, ciliary loss, other ultrastructural alterations in the epithelium and changes in the viscoelastic properties of mucus. Studies of patients before and after surgical restoration of sinus ventilation have shown that mucociliary function improves gradually over 1-6 months postoperatively. The slower than normal rate of recovery of mucociliary clearance after surgery highlights the importance of careful postoperative medical and surgical management which is discussed in Chapters 19 and 20.",M2
17515466,"Congenital heart disease and other heterotaxic defects in a large cohort of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a recessive genetic disorder that is characterized by sinopulmonary disease and reflects abnormal ciliary structure and function. Situs inversus totalis occurs in approximately 50% of PCD patients (Kartagener's syndrome in PCD), and there are a few reports of PCD with heterotaxy (situs ambiguus), such as cardiovascular anomalies. Advances in diagnosis of PCD, such as genetic testing, allow the systematic investigation of this association. METHODS AND RESULTS: The prevalence of heterotaxic defects was determined in 337 PCD patients by retrospective review of radiographic and ultrasound data. Situs solitus (normal situs) and situs inversus totalis were identified in 46.0% and 47.7% of patients, respectively, and 6.3% (21 patients) had heterotaxy. As compared with patients with situs solitus, those with situs abnormalities had more ciliary outer dynein arm defects, fewer inner dynein arm and central apparatus defects (P&lt;0.001), and more mutations in ciliary outer dynein arm genes (DNAI1 and DNAH5; P=0.022). Seven of 12 patients with heterotaxy who were genotyped had mutations in DNAI1 or DNAH5. Twelve patients with heterotaxy had cardiac and/or vascular abnormalities, and most (8 of 12 patients) had complex congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: At least 6.3% of patients with PCD have heterotaxy, and most of those have cardiovascular abnormalities. The prevalence of congenital heart disease with heterotaxy is 200-fold higher in PCD than in the general population (1:50 versus 1:10 000); thus, patients with PCD should have cardiac evaluation. Conversely, mutations in genes that adversely affect both respiratory and embryological nodal cilia are a significant cause of heterotaxy and congenital heart disease, and screening for PCD is indicated in those patients.",M2
17449765,"High-resolution CT of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.OBJECTIVE: High-resolution CT is an important tool in the detection and management of bronchiectasis, but there is little information about high-resolution CT findings in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). We analyzed all high-resolution CT studies of the chest available for a cohort of PCD patients to identify an associated pattern of high-resolution CT changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution CT studies were available for 45 PCD patients from 42 families with ranges of age and disease severity. The images were assessed for severity and distribution of bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, mucous plugging, and other findings. A bronchiectasis severity score was calculated. CT findings were correlated with phenotypic findings, including situs type, ciliary ultrastructural defect, nasal level of nitric oxide, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and microbiologic findings in the airways. RESULTS: Twenty-nine adults (mean age, 42 +/- 15 years; age range, 21-73 years) and 16 children (mean age, 8 +/- 4 years; age range, 1-14 years) were included; 26 (58%) of the patients were women or girls. Situs inversus totalis (38%) or heterotaxy (18%) was identified in 56% of the patients. A high (9%) prevalence of pectus excavatum was identified. High-resolution CT of all of the adult and 56% of the pediatric patients showed bronchiectasis in a predominantly middle and lower lobe distribution. The right middle lobe was most commonly involved. Bronchiectasis severity score correlated with older age and worse pulmonary function. CONCLUSION: High-resolution CT shows that pulmonary disease related to PCD predominantly involves the middle and lower lobes of the lungs. In adults, high-resolution CT findings negative for bronchiectasis may have a role in excluding the diagnosis of PCD. Correlation of severity of disease on high-resolution CT with patient phenotype gives further insight into the diversity and natural history of PCD.",M2
17360648,"A common variant in combination with a nonsense mutation in a member of the thioredoxin family causes primary ciliary dyskinesia.Thioredoxins belong to a large family of enzymatic proteins that function as general protein disulfide reductases, therefore participating in several cellular processes via redox-mediated reactions. So far, none of the 18 members of this family has been involved in human pathology. Here we identified TXNDC3, which encodes a thioredoxin-nucleoside diphosphate kinase, as a gene implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), a genetic condition characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, left-right asymmetry randomization, and male infertility. We show that the disease, which segregates as a recessive trait, results from the unusual combination of the following two transallelic defects: a nonsense mutation and a common intronic variant found in 1% of control chromosomes. This variant affects the ratio of two physiological TXNDC3 transcripts: the full-length isoform and a novel isoform, TXNDC3d7, carrying an in-frame deletion of exon 7. In vivo and in vitro expression data unveiled the physiological importance of TXNDC3d7 (whose expression was reduced in the patient) and the corresponding protein that was shown to bind microtubules. PCD is known to result from defects of the axoneme, an organelle common to respiratory cilia, embryonic nodal cilia, and sperm flagella, containing dynein arms, with, to date, the implication of genes encoding dynein proteins. Our findings, which identify a another class of molecules involved in PCD, disclose the key role of TXNDC3 in ciliary function; they also point to an unusual mechanism underlying a Mendelian disorder, which is an SNP-induced modification of the ratio of two physiological isoforms generated by alternative splicing.",M2

The diagnostic role of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels was evaluated in those patients. METHODS: Sixty-four children with recurrent pneumonia were studied with ciliary motion analysis, TEM, and nNO. RESULTS: Investigations indicated PCD in 12 patients, secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) in 50 patients, and normal results in 2 patients. In 4 of 50 children with SCD, atypical PCD was considered possible. The mean (+/- SD) nNO was 130 +/- 46.95 parts per billion in children affected by PCD, 127.79 +/- 68.58 parts per billion in atypical patients, and 760 +/- 221 parts per billion in children with SCD. Three to 5 months later, the nNO level was 132.75 +/- 55.76 parts per billion in children with atypical disease and 778.00 +/- 197 parts per billion in children with SCD. CONCLUSION: Low levels of nNO may help to identify patients with atypical PCD.",M2

No statistically significant increase in the frequency of these mutations was found in the studied group, as compared with the general population.

17111736,"Kartagener syndrome: an unusual cause of respiratory distress in the newborn.BACKGROUND: Kartagener Syndrome (KS) a rare genetic disorder belongs to a group of disorders referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) where the cilia covering the respiratory epithelium is either immotile or beat in an uncoordinated fashion. It is characterized by a triad of dextrocardia (with or without situs inversus), chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis as a result of poor mucociliary clearance of mucus and bacteria. This may lead to respiratory distress in the newborn period. METHOD: This is a case report of a 14-day old male who presented with respiratory distress (which was noticed soon afterbirth) and features suggestive of KS. CONCLUSION: KS should be suspected in neonates presenting with respiratory distress, pneumonia and no risk factors for infection.",M2
17040569,"Living with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a prospective qualitative study of knowledge sharing, symptom concealment, embarrassment, mistrust, and stigma.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a chronic respiratory disease for which there is little psycho-social research and no qualitative studies of individuals living with the condition. A questionnaire-based survey in 2003 found evidence of stigmatisation in some individuals with PCD. Although the questionnaire had face and construct validity, stigmatisation was not cross-validated against interviews. The present study had the twin aims of carrying out a qualitative study of the adult patients living with PCD, and using a structured design to validate the questionnaire measure of stigma. METHODS: Interviews were carried out with six pairs of individuals with PCD, matched for sex, situs, and age, one with a high stigma score in 2003 and the other with a low stigma score. Depth-qualitative interviews were conducted by one author to explore themes surrounding the psycho-social impact of PCD using a grounded theory analysis. The interviewer was blind to the stigma scores of participants, and after the qualitative analysis was completed, the interviewer made an assessment of which member of each pair seemed the more stigmatised, after which the code was broken. RESULTS: Interviews revealed a number of themes, including other people's knowledge of PCD, the sharing of knowledge about PCD, the concealment of symptoms of PCD, embarrassment at symptoms, changes of behaviour in response to PCD, mistrust of medical care, in particular in relation to problems in diagnosis, a mistrust of general practitioners who were seen as poorly informed, and the importance of expert care at tertiary referral centres. Although stigmatisation as such was rarely mentioned directly by respondents, when the interviewer's judgement on level of stigmatisation was correlated with stigma scores from 2003, it was found that the more stigmatised member had been correctly identified in all six pairs (p = .016). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that some people with PCD feel isolated through mistrust in medicine, and lack of knowledge surrounding PCD. Many responses to PCD can be explained in terms of stigmatisation, and in particular felt stigma. The correlation between questionnaire used several years previously, and the interviewer's judgements of stigmatisation suggest that the stigma questionnaire had both predictive validity and long-term stability. As in other chronic conditions, stigmatisation occurs only in some individuals with PCD, and the present study explores the basis of stigmatisation, and validate the questionnaire as a measure of difference in stigma.",M2

The disease is caused by mutations in genes that are required for proper ciliary function. The defect in ciliary function results in reduced or absent mucociliary clearance, thereby predisposing the affected individual to repeated bacterial infections. Recent advances in the understanding of the basic biology and function of the cilium have led to the identification of some of the genes that are mutated in cases of PCD. Further studies of this disease will likely lead to earlier diagnosis, better treatment, and improved outcomes.",M2
16858015,"Mutations of DNAI1 in primary ciliary dyskinesia: evidence of founder effect in a common mutation.RATIONALE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive, genetic disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction, sino-pulmonary disease, and situs inversus. Disease-causing mutations have been reported in DNAI1 and DNAH5 encoding outer dynein arm (ODA) proteins of cilia. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed DNAI1 to identify disease-causing mutations in PCD and to determine if the previously reported IVS1+2_3insT (219+3insT) mutation represents a  founder  or  hot spot  mutation. METHODS: Patients with PCD from 179 unrelated families were studied. Exclusion mapping showed no linkage to DNAI1 for 13 families; the entire coding region was sequenced in a patient from the remaining 166 families. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on nasal epithelial RNA in 14 families. RESULTS: Mutations in DNAI1 including 12 novel mutations were identified in 16 of 179 (9%) families; 14 harbored biallelic mutations. Deep intronic splice mutations were not identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of mutations in families with defined ODA defect was 13%; no mutations were found in patients without a defined ODA defect. The previously reported IVS1+2_3insT mutation accounted for 57% (17/30) of mutant alleles, and marker analysis indicates a common founder for this mutation. Seven mutations occurred in three exons (13, 16, and 17); taken together with previous reports, these three exons are emerging as mutation clusters harboring 29% (12/42) of mutant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 10% of patients with PCD are estimated to harbor mutations in DNAI1; most occur as a common founder IVS1+2_3insT or in exons 13, 16, and 17. This information is useful for establishing a clinical molecular genetic test for PCD.",M2

We describe a structural equation model linking a questionnaire measure of stigmatization to sex, age, personality (Big Five), symptoms (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), health status (SF-36) and stress (GHQ-12). Stigma did not relate to physical symptoms or health, or to situs, but correlated with mental health and the social impact of symptoms.

16757159,"Calcium stone lithoptysis in primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: An association between lithoptysis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) has not been previously reported. However, reports of lithoptysis from 2 older patients (&gt;60 yr) prompted a study of this association. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of all PCD patients presenting to our institution between August 2003 and March 2006, seeking the symptom of lithoptysis or calcium deposition on radiology. A retrospective analysis of all PCD patients presenting prior to August 2003 was also performed. Patients age &gt; or = 40 previously reviewed were recontacted. If a history of lithoptysis or calcium deposition was present, we further reviewed radiographic, microbiologic, and biochemical data, including serum calcium and phosphate. Broncholiths were analyzed by light and electron microscopy- and electron-dispersive X-ray analysis. RESULTS: In total, 142 patients (n=28 age &gt; or = 40) were included, 41 in the prospective and 91 in the retrospective study. Lithoptysis was reported in 5 patients (all age &gt; or = 40). Chest CT scans identified calcification (4/5), involving bronchiectatic airways in 3 patients and focal nodular calcification in 1 patient. Two other patients (age 46, 59) were identified with airway calcification without lithoptysis. Available broncholiths from 2 of these patients were composed of calcite, whereas a broncholith from 1 patient with focal nodular calcification contained calcium phosphate. Sputum was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in all 7 patients, but negative for mycobacterial and fungal cultures. CONCLUSION: There is an association between lithoptysis and PCD in patients age &gt; or = 40. We hypothesize that calcite stone formation is a biomineralization response to chronic airway inflammation and retention of infected airway secretions in PCD in a subset of PCD patients.",M2
16712736,"Long-term clearance from small airways in subjects with ciliary dysfunction.The objective of this study was to investigate if long-term clearance from small airways is dependent on normal ciliary function. Six young adults with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) inhaled 111 Indium labelled Teflon particles of 4.2 microm geometric and 6.2 microm aerodynamic diameter with an extremely slow inhalation flow, 0.05 L/s. The inhalation method deposits particles mainly in the small conducting airways. Lung retention was measured immediately after inhalation and at four occasions up to 21 days after inhalation. Results were compared with data from ten healthy controls. For additional comparison three of the PCD subjects also inhaled the test particles with normal inhalation flow, 0.5 L/s, providing a more central deposition. The lung retention at 24 h in % of lung deposition (Ret24) was higher (p &lt; 0.001) in the PCD subjects, 79 % (95% Confidence Interval, 67.6;90.6), compared to 49% (42.3;55.5) in the healthy controls. There was a significant clearance after 24 h both in the PCD subjects and in the healthy controls with equivalent clearance. The mean Ret24 with slow inhalation flow was 73.9 +/- 1.9% compared to 68.9 +/- 7.5% with normal inhalation flow in the three PCD subjects exposed twice. During day 7-21 the three PCD subjects exposed twice cleared 9% with normal flow, probably representing predominantly alveolar clearance, compared to 19% with slow inhalation flow, probably representing mainly small airway clearance. This study shows that despite ciliary dysfunction, clearance continues in the small airways beyond 24 h. There are apparently additional clearance mechanisms present in the small airways.",M2
16627867,"DNAH5 mutations are a common cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia with outer dynein arm defects.RATIONALE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is characterized by recurrent airway infections and randomization of left-right body asymmetry. To date, autosomal recessive mutations have only been identified in a small number of patients involving DNAI1 and DNAH5, which encode outer dynein arm components. METHODS: We screened 109 white PCD families originating from Europe and North America for presence of DNAH5 mutations by haplotype analyses and/or sequencing. RESULTS: Haplotype analyses excluded linkage in 26 families. In 30 PCD families, we identified 33 novel (12 nonsense, 8 frameshift, 5 splicing, and 8 missense mutations) and two known DNAH5 mutations. We observed clustering of mutations within five exons harboring 27 mutant alleles (52%) of the 52 detected mutant alleles. Interestingly, 6 (32%) of 19 PCD families with DNAH5 mutations from North America carry the novel founder mutation 10815delT. Electron microscopic analyses in 22 patients with PCD with mutations invariably detected outer dynein arm ciliary defects. High-resolution immunofluorescence imaging of respiratory epithelial cells from eight patients with DNAH5 mutations showed mislocalization of mutant DNAH5 and accumulation at the microtubule organizing centers. Mutant DNAH5 was absent throughout the ciliary axoneme in seven patients and remained detectable in the proximal ciliary axoneme in one patient carrying compound heterozygous splicing mutations at the 3'-end (IVS75-2A&gt;T, IVS76+5G&gt;A). In a preselected subpopulation with documented outer dynein arm defects (n = 47), DNAH5 mutations were identified in 53% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: DNAH5 is frequently mutated in patients with PCD exhibiting outer dynein arm defects and mutations cluster in five exons.",M2
16617444,"Markers of airway inflammation in primary ciliary dyskinesia studied using exhaled breath condensate.Macroscopically, the airways in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) are inflamed and infected, and the eventual result is bronchiectasis. The measurement of noninvasive markers of inflammation in PCD may allow determination of mechanisms of tissue damage, and even allow monitoring of therapy. The aim of this study was to measure in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of children with PCD the concentrations of the neutrophil chemoattractants leukotriene (LT) B4 and interleukin (IL)-8 and the marker of oxidative stress 8-isoprostane (8-IP), and to try determining whether these markers can be used to assess mechanisms of airway inflammation in these patients. Concentrations of LTB4, IL-8, and 8-IP in the EBC of 23 PCD and 11 age-matched healthy children were measured using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The children also performed spirometry and underwent sputum induction, the latter for differential cell count. The concentrations of 8-IP in EBC of children with stable PCD were significantly increased compared to normal controls (median, 7.8 pg/ml vs. 3.1 pg/ml; P = 0.004). There was no difference in the median concentrations of EBC LTB4 between PCD subjects and healthy controls (28 pg/ml vs. 28 pg/ml; P = 0.5). IL-8 levels were below the detection limit of the assay, and were not analyzed further. There was no correlation between concentrations of either 8-IP or LTB(4) in EBC and forced expired volume in 1 sec in PCD children. Sputum induction was successful in 83% of the subjects; the median induced sputum neutrophil count was 69% (interquartile range, 59.3-73.6). No significant correlation was found between sputum neutrophils and either EBC 8-IP or LTB4 concentrations in PCD children. This study showed that oxidative stress, as reflected by increased exhaled 8-IP concentration, is increased in PCD children. The mechanism of airway neutrophilia is unclear, but is unlikely to be related to increased production of LTB4, at least in stable PCD patients.",M2
16586482,"Composition of nasal airway surface liquid in cystic fibrosis and other airway diseases determined by X-ray microanalysis.The ionic composition of the airway surface liquid (ASL) in healthy individuals and in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been debated. Ion transport properties of the upper airway epithelium are similar to those of the lower airways and it is easier to collect nasal ASL from the nose. ASL was collected with ion exchange beads, and the elemental composition of nasal fluid was determined by X-ray microanalysis in healthy subjects, CF patients, CF heterozygotes, patients with rhinitis, and with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). In healthy subjects, the ionic concentrations were approximately isotonic. In CF patients, CF heterozygotes, rhinitis, and PCD patients, [Na] and [Cl] were significantly higher compared when compared with those in controls. [K] was significantly higher in CF and PCD patients compared with that in controls. Severely affected CF patients had higher ionic concentrations in their nasal ASL than in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Female CF patients had higher levels of Na, Cl, and K than male patients. As higher salt concentrations in the ASL are also found in other patients with airway diseases involving chronic inflammation, it appears likely that inflammation-induced epithelial damage is important in determining the ionic composition of the ASL.",M2
16553254,"Transmission electron microscopy in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is an autosomal recessive disease with extensive genetic heterogeneity. Dyskinetic or completely absent motility of cilia predisposes to recurrent pulmonary and upper respiratory tract infections resulting in bronchiectasis. Also infections of the middle ear are common due to lack of ciliary movement in the Eustachian tube. Men have reduced fertility due to spermatozoa with absent motility or abnormalities in the ductuli efferentes. Female subfertility and tendency to ectopic pregnancy has also been suggested. Headache, a common complaint in PCD patients, has been associated with absence of cilia in the brain ventricles, leading to decreased circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, half of the patients with PCD has situs inversus, probably due to the absence of ciliary motility in Hensen's node in the embryo, which is responsible for the unidirectional flow of fluid on the back of the embryo, which determines sidedness. PCD, which is an inborn disease, should be distinguished from secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) which is an acquired disease. Transmission electron microscopy is the most commonly used method for diagnosis of PCD, even though alternative methods, such as determination of ciliary motility and measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) may be considered. The best method to distinguish PCD from SCD is the determination of the number of inner and outer dynein arms, which can be carried out reliably on a limited number of ciliary cross-sections. There is also a significant difference in the ciliary orientation (determined by the direction of a line drawn through the central microtubule pair) between PCD and SCD, but there is some overlap in the values, making this parameter less suitable to distinguish PCD from SCD.",M2
16424421,"Mucus properties in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia: comparison with cystic fibrosis.OBJECTIVE: It has been assumed that cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is due in part to abnormal airway mucus. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a form of bronchiectasis that is similar to CF in many ways but is caused by congenital defects in mucociliary clearance. Our objective was to compare the biophysical and transport properties of CF and PCD sputa in subjects matched for age and degree of lung function impairment. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: PCD patients (n = 19; mean age, 9.5 +/- 3.0 years [+/- SD]; FEV1, 65.0 +/- 7.8 L) were recruited from the clinic at the Royal Brompton Hospital. Patients with CF (n = 30, mean age, 10.8 +/- 2.6 years; FEV1, 61.8 +/- 22.8 L) were identified from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine CF Center. Pulmonary function testing and sputum collection were performed as part of routine, scheduled clinic visits. MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was measured by spirometry, and sputum was collected during the pulmonary function test maneuver. Some patients were longitudinally assessed at visits during the course of 3 years. Sputum properties measured were dynamic viscoelasticity, wettability, cohesivity, interfacial (surface) tension, solids composition, DNA and interleukin (IL)-8 concentration, in vitro mucociliary transportability, and cough transportability. RESULTS: Inflammation as measured by IL-8 concentration was three times greater in the PCD sputa (p &lt; 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the sputum biophysical or transport properties comparing CF with PCD sputum. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that established CF lung disease is principally due to abnormal sputum properties, and it is more likely that the biophysical and transport properties reflect disease severity regardless of whether bronchiectasis is due to CF or PCD.",M2
16397065,"Linkage analysis localises a Kartagener syndrome gene to a 3.5 cM region on chromosome 15q24-25.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetic disorder caused by ciliary immotility/dysmotility due to ultrastructural defects of the cilia. Kartagener syndrome (KS), a subtype of PCD, is characterised by situs inversus accompanying the typical PCD symptoms of bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. In most cases, PCD is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, but its genetic basis is unclear due to extensive genetic heterogeneity. METHODS: In a genome-wide search for PCD loci performed in 52 KS families and in 18 PCD families with no situs inversus present (CDO, ciliary dysfunction-only), the maximal pairwise LOD score of 3.36 with D15S205 in the KS families indicated linkage of a KS locus to the long arm of chromosome 15. In the follow-up study, 65 additional microsatellite markers encompassing D15S205 were analysed. RESULTS: A maximal pairwise LOD score of 4.34 was observed with D15S154, further supporting linkage of the KS, but not the CDO, families to 15q24-25. Analysis of heterogeneity and haplotypes suggested linkage to this region in 60% of KS families. CONCLUSIONS: Reinforced by the results of multipoint linkage, our analyses indicate that a major KS locus is localised within a 3.5 cM region on 15q, between D15S973 and D15S1037.",M2
16353174,"Impairment of nitric oxide output of conducting airways in primary ciliary dyskinesia.Nasal nitric oxide (NO) concentration is dramatically reduced in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). The aims of this study were to apply a multiple-flow NO analysis to investigate whether NO output from the bronchial tree was affected in a similar way to nasal NO output, and to search for a relationship between flow-independent exchange parameters and airflow limitation. Multiple flow rate analysis of exhaled NO, allowing the calculation of maximum airway wall flux and alveolar NO concentration, was performed in 17 PCD patients (median age, 25-75th percentiles: 13.5, 12.1-17.6) with documented ultrastructural cilia abnormalities and 28 healthy subjects (16.0, 11.0-21.0). Median maximum airway wall flux and median alveolar NO concentration were significantly reduced in PCD patients compared to healthy subjects: 16.0, 7.5-29.5, vs. 25.0, 15.0-32.5 nl/min (P&lt;0.05) and 2.5, 1.6-3.3, vs. 5.0, 3.6-6.5 ppb (P&lt;0.01), respectively. Significant correlations between maximum airway wall flux and airflow limitation were found, i.e., resistance of respiratory system (rho=0.74, P&lt;0.005), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))/VC (rho= -0.61, P&lt;0.05), FEV(1) (rho=-0.52, P&lt; 0.05), mid expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of forced vital capacity (MEF(25-75)) (rho=-0.54, P&lt;0.05), and maximal instantaneous expiratory flow at 50% of the vital capacity (MEF(50)) (rho=-0.55, P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the impairment of NO output is less pronounced in the lower than in the upper (nasal) respiratory tract in PCD. A decrease in maximal NO output from conducting airways is associated with limited airflow impairment.",M2
16085212,"Repeatability of standardised nasal nitric oxide measurements in healthy and asthmatic adults and children.Several nasal nitric oxide (NO) measurement techniques have been described, but there is not a widespread measurement technique for measurement of nasal NO. In this study we evaluated the repeatability of one technique of nasal NO measurements using the nasal application of the NIOX system. METHODS: Three nasal NO measurements (NIOX Nitric Oxide Monitoring System, Aerocrine, Sweden) were made on a single occasion in 22 healthy subjects and 27 patients with asthma, aged 5-69 years. Nasal NO was sampled during breath hold from one nostril at a flow rate of 5 ml/s. RESULTS: The repeatability of nasal NO assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV) was 12.5% (95% Confidence interval (CI) 11.0-14.7%) for the total population. Healthy adults had a significantly better repeatability than healthy children (P&lt;0.008). The mean NO level for the total population was 837 ppb. The mean NO levels in children were lower than in the adults (751 and 897 ppb, respectively). The mean breath hold length needed to obtain a steady NO plateau for all subject categories combined was 20.4+/-6.01 s. The average number of attempts needed to obtain three approved NO measurements was 5.4 (range 3-13) for the total population. There were no significant differences between the different subject categories. When using two measurements per session instead of three, the overall CV was 10.5% (95% CI 8.8-13.1%). Most subjects found the measurements easy to perform and all of them would accept to do the examination as a routine. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal NO measurements in NIOX may provide a useful reliable clinical tool to assess and monitor upper airways in different diseases, for example <e>PCD</e> and rhinitis, and are acceptable by both healthy and asthmatic adults and children, as a part of their routine visit to a physician.",M2
16055928,"RPGR is mutated in patients with a complex X linked phenotype combining primary ciliary dyskinesia and retinitis pigmentosa.INTRODUCTION: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a rare disease classically transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and characterised by recurrent airway infections due to abnormal ciliary structure and function. To date, only two autosomal genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5 encoding axonemal dynein chains, have been shown to cause PCD with defective outer dynein arms. Here, we investigated one non-consanguineous family in which a woman with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) gave birth to two boys with a complex phenotype combining PCD, discovered in early childhood and characterised by partial dynein arm defects, and RP that occurred secondarily. The family history prompted us to search for an X linked gene that could account for both conditions. RESULTS: We found perfect segregation of the disease phenotype with RP3 associated markers (Xp21.1). Analysis of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) located at this locus revealed a mutation (631_IVS6+9del) in the two boys and their mother. As shown by study of RPGR transcripts expressed in nasal epithelial cells, this intragenic deletion, which leads to activation of a cryptic donor splice site, predicts a severely truncated protein. CONCLUSION: These data provide the first clear demonstration of X linked transmission of PCD. This unusual mode of inheritance of PCD in patients with particular phenotypic features (that is, partial dynein arm defects and association with RP), which should modify the current management of families affected by PCD or RP, unveils the importance of RPGR in the proper development of both respiratory ciliary structures and connecting cilia of photoreceptors.",M2
16036877,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia: a review.The entity sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus is since long named Kartagener syndrome. Nowadays the designation used is primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), which implies cilia with decreased or total absence of motility, which may result in sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and male infertility. A large number of deficiencies detectable on the ultrastructural level give rise to PCD. There may also be aberrations not detected up to the present. The normal left-right asymmetry of the body is thought to be due to the beating of the cilia in the embryonic (Hensen's) node. Total immotility of the cilia should therefore result in random asymmetry of the body that is situs inversus in 50% of the cases. It has also been claimed that 50% of cases with PCD have situs inversus. However, several deficiencies apparently do not cause total immotility, and all ultrastructural variants are not associated with situs inversus in 50% of the cases. Several of the deficiencies are difficult to detect. Optimal fixation and handling are therefore obligatory. The genetic changes behind the variants are now being studied in several laboratories. Patients with PCD have very low levels of nasal nitric oxide, which is of increasing diagnostic importance. Other established diagnostic methods are the saccharine test and determination of ciliary beat frequency.",M2
16005347,"Hearing outcomes in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia--a longitudinal study.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a congenital abnormality of ciliary structure or function. The otological manifestations of the disease include otitis media with effusion (OME). To date, the severity of hearing loss and natural progression of OME in this select group of patients has not been documented. In this retrospective observational study, we looked at the tympanograms and audiograms of all children with PCD attending the Royal Brompton Hospital multidisciplinary clinic. Our results show an improvement in both hearing thresholds and tympanograms with age (p&lt;0.001). Most cases resolve by the age of 12. This supports the current practice of conservative management in these patients. The problems of persistent otorrhoea and residual tympanic membrane perforation are thereby avoided with the reassurance that hearing loss will spontaneously resolve with time.",M2
15937072,"Identification of predicted human outer dynein arm genes: candidates for primary ciliary dyskinesia genes.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a severe inherited disorder characterised by chronic respiratory disease, male infertility, and, in approximately 50% of affected individuals, a left-right asymmetry defect called situs inversus. PCD is caused by defects in substructures of the ciliary and flagellar axoneme, most commonly loss of the outer dynein arms. Although PCD is believed to involve mutations in many genes, only three have been identified. METHODS: To facilitate discovery of new PCD genes, we have used database searching and analysis to systematically identify the human homologues of proteins associated with the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii outer dynein arm, the best characterised outer arm of any species. RESULTS: We find that 12 out of 14 known Chlamydomonas outer arm subunits have one or more likely orthologues in humans. The results predict a total of 24 human genes likely to encode outer dynein arm subunits and associated proteins possibly necessary for outer arm assembly, plus 12 additional closely related human genes likely to encode inner dynein arm subunits. CONCLUSION: These genes, which have been located on the human chromosomes for easy comparison with known or suspected PCD loci, are excellent candidates for screening for disease-causing mutations in PCD patients with outer and/or inner dynein arm defects.",M2
15845866,"Identification and analysis of axonemal dynein light chain 1 in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by chronic infections of the upper and lower airways, randomization of left/right body asymmetry, and reduced fertility. The phenotype results from dysfunction of motile cilia of the respiratory epithelium, at the embryonic node and of sperm flagella. Ultrastructural defects often involve outer dynein arms (ODAs), that are composed of several light (LCs), intermediate, and heavy (HCs) dynein chains. We recently showed that recessive mutations of DNAH5, the human ortholog of the biflagellate Chlamydomonas ODA gamma-HC, cause PCD. In Chlamydomonas, motor protein activity of the gamma-ODA-HC is regulated by binding of the axonemal LC1. We report the identification of the human (DNAL1) and murine (Dnal1) orthologs of the Chlamydomonas LC1-gene. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed specific expression in testis, embryonic node, respiratory epithelium, and ependyma, resembling the DNAH5 expression pattern. In silico protein analysis showed complete conservation of the LC1/gamma-HC binding motif in DNAL1. Protein interaction studies demonstrated binding of DNAL1 and DNAH5. Based on these findings, we considered DNAL1 a candidate for PCD and sequenced all exons of DNAL1 in 86 patients. Mutational analysis was negative, excluding a major role of DNAL1 in the pathogenesis of PCD.",M2
15806596,"Correlation between cough frequency and airway inflammation in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia.Cough is common in airway disease. We measured cough frequency in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), to determine how accurately families assess this symptom; and to assess the relationship between cough frequency and airway inflammation, measured using induced sputum and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Twenty stable PCD children (7 boys), median age 10.8 years (interquartile range (IQR), 9-14), and 10 healthy control children, median age 12 years (IQR, 10.5-12.7), were recruited. ENO was measured using a chemiluminescence analyzer, with sputum induction with 3.5% saline. PCD children underwent ambulatory cough monitoring. Sputum neutrophils were higher in PCD (median, 70.3%; IQR, 55.3-78%) compared to controls (median, 27%; IQR, 24.5-33%; P = 0.004); cough frequency was higher (median episodes, 19; IQR, 11-22.5) compared to healthy children (median episodes, 6.7; IQR, 4.1-10.5; P &lt; 0.001). Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1) percent predicted) and eNO were lower in PCD (median, 63%; IQR, 57-85%; P &lt; 0.0001); eNO (median, 7.1 ppb (IQR, 4.8-19.1 ppb) vs. 12.4 ppb (IQR, 10.3-17.3 ppb), P = 0.043). Parental scoring of day and night cough correlated with recorded cough (r = 0.930, P &lt; 0.0001, daytime; r = 0.711 for nighttime, P = 0.002). Visual analogue score and cough episodes also correlated positively (r = 0.906; P &lt; 0.0001). There was a positive correlation between cough frequency and sputum neutrophil count in PCD (Spearman's r = 0.693, P &lt; 0.002), but not percent FEV(1) or eNO. Stable PCD children have increased cough frequency and neutrophilic airway inflammation. In conclusion, cough frequency correlated with sputum neutrophils but not with FEV1 or eNO.",M2
15750039,"Mislocalization of DNAH5 and DNAH9 in respiratory cells from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.RATIONALE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the airways and situs inversus in half of the affected offspring. The most frequent genetic defects comprise recessive mutations of DNAH5 and DNAI1, which encode outer dynein arm (ODA) components. Diagnosis of PCD usually relies on electron microscopy, which is technically demanding and sometimes difficult to interpret. METHODS: Using specific antibodies, we determined the subcellular localization of the ODA heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 in human respiratory epithelial and sperm cells of patients with PCD and control subjects by high-resolution immunofluorescence imaging. We also assessed cilia and sperm tail function by high-speed video microscopy. RESULTS: In normal ciliated airway epithelium, DNAH5 and DNAH9 show a specific regional distribution along the ciliary axoneme, indicating the existence of at least two distinct ODA types. DNAH5 was completely or only distally absent from the respiratory ciliary axoneme in patients with PCD with DNAH5- (n = 3) or DNAI1- (n = 1) mutations, respectively, and instead accumulated at the microtubule-organizing centers. In contrast to respiratory cilia, sperm tails from a patient with DNAH5 mutations had normal ODA heavy chain distribution, suggesting different modes of ODA generation in these cell types. Blinded investigation of a large cohort of patients with PCD and control subjects identified DNAH5 mislocalization in all patients diagnosed with ODA defects by electron microscopy (n = 16). Cilia with complete axonemal DNAH5 deficiency were immotile, whereas cilia with distal DNAH5 deficiency showed residual motility. CONCLUSIONS: Immunofluorescence staining can detect ODA defects, which will possibly aid PCD diagnosis.",M2

In a study of 88 people with PCD, only 15.2% of 46 individuals with situs inversus, and 14.3% of 42 individuals with situs solitus, were left handed. Because cerebral lateralization is therefore still present, the nodal cilia cannot be the primary mechanism responsible for symmetry breaking in the vertebrate body.

15328681,"Ten-year experience using a plastic, disposable curette for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) results in impaired mucociliary clearance. Patients with this disorder develop chronic sinopulmonary disease with recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyposis, pneumonia, and, ultimately, bronchiectasis. Other associated findings of dysfunctional ciliary activity include situs inversus, dextrocardia, and infertility. OBJECTIVE: To describe our 10-year experience using a small, plastic, disposable curette to perform a screening procedure for cilia function and to collect samples for electron microscopy. METHODS: In the past 10 years, we screened infants and children with severe chronic sinusitis and other chronic recurrent upper respiratory tract problems for PCD by using a plastic, disposable curette to collect tissue samples from the nasal mucosa. Samples were placed in sterile saline and examined under light microscopy for the presence of cilia. Failure to note ciliary movement prompted another examination 1 month later. If no functional cilia were noted at the follow-up examination, a specimen was obtained and sent for electron microscopy. RESULTS: We identified 7 patients with PCD; 2 had situs inversus totalis. Average age at diagnosis was 3 years. The most common symptom at presentation was frequent upper respiratory tract infections with severe otitis media (7 patients) and sinusitis (5 patients). Recurrent pneumonia was present in 6 patients. Dynein arm deficiency was the most common electron microscopic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating children for PCD by using a plastic, disposable curette is a relatively simple procedure that could be used by allergists in practice. Primary ciliary dyskinesia occurs frequently enough that physicians should consider it as part of the differential diagnosis in evaluating children with recurrent, severe sinopulmonary infections.",M2
15224888,"The secondary nature of ciliary (dis)orientation in secondary and primary ciliary dyskinesia.OBJECTIVE: Ciliary orientation (COR) is an important parameter of mucociliary clearance and ciliary disorientation has been reported in cases of acquired abnormalities [secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD)] and in a very few cases as the single abnormality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). The etiology, pathogenesis, consequences and relevance of ciliary (dis)orientation are still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To elucidate the primary or secondary nature of ciliary (dis)orientation, COR was measured in 179 non-PCD and 59 PCD patients. COR was measured in biopsies and after ciliogenesis in culture and was correlated with a number of functional and ultrastructural parameters. COR was defined as the SD of the angles of lines through the central pair of microtubules using transmission electron microscopy. Internationally accepted normal values for COR are &lt; or = 20 degrees; COR values of 20-35 degrees indicate increased disorientation; and COR values &gt; 35 degrees represent a random orientation. RESULTS: For non-PCD biopsies, COR increased with increasing SCD, from 15 +/- 7 degrees (n = 54) for normal (&lt; 5%) SCD to 28 +/- 8 degrees (n = 16) for severe (&gt; 25%) SCD. No correlation was found between COR and ciliary beat frequency. However, increased COR values (28 +/- 8 degrees) were found for immotility (n = 8), compared to (coordinated) ciliary activity (19 +/- 9 degrees) (n = 121). After ciliogenesis no ultrastructural abnormalities were found and COR was normal (13 +/- 5 degrees; n = 308). COR can therefore be considered to be secondary in non-PCD and correlates with SCD percentage and ciliary motility. In biopsies from PCD patients with dynein deficiency and with normal ultrastructure, COR was increased, to 28 +/- 11 degrees (n = 32) and 21 +/- 7 degrees (n = 15), respectively, and in cases with central pair abnormalities COR was random (38 +/- 11 degrees; n = 12). After ciliogenesis COR remained random in the PCD group with central pair abnormalities (38 +/- 9 degrees; n = 15), and was increased in the PCD groups with dynein deficiency (24 +/- 10 degrees; n = 35) and normal ultrastructure (25 +/- 8 degrees; n = 17). Ciliary disorientation was never found as the single abnormality. CONCLUSION: COR can be considered to be secondary in PCD. Both ciliary (im)motility and SCD percentage contribute to COR.",M2
15222957,"Cilia, primary ciliary dyskinesia and molecular genetics.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous condition in which three genetic mutations have already been identified. The primary defect is in the ultrastructure or function of cilia, highly complex organelles that are structurally related to the flagella of sperm and protozoa. The clinical features of PCD include recurrent sinopulmonary infections, subfertility and laterality defects; the latter due to ciliary dysfunction at the embryological node. Completion of the human genome sequence has accelerated the identification and characterisation of disease genes, and the current molecular strategy in PCD includes candidate gene analysis, positional cloning, model organism analysis and proteomic analysis. The identification of these genes will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly and function of cilia and the pathway that determines left-right axis in man.

15126740,"Atypical sinusitis in adults must lead to looking for cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia.HYPOTHESES/OBJECTIVES:: In adults, purulent pansinusitis or nasal polyposis starting early in life or that is permanently infected or associated either with chronic bronchial infection, infertility, or situs inversus are uncommon. In these atypical cases of chronic sinusitis (ACS), a primary dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance can be suspected. Adult patients with ACS were therefore investigated to detect primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) or cystic fibrosis (CF). STUDY DESIGN: Open, prospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with ACS were investigated with ciliary beat frequency and ultrastructure analysis in nasal cells and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation analysis in blood leukocytes. RESULTS: The diagnosis of PCD was confirmed in seven (17%) patients. At least one CFTR gene mutation was detected in 16 (38%) patients. The diagnosis of CF was suggested in three (7%) compound heterozygous patients. Another 13 (31%) patients were heterozygous for a CFTR gene mutation or a complex allele. Comparison of clinical features of ACS showed that only a family history of chronic sinusitis (P &lt;.01) or chronic bronchitis (P &lt;.02) and the presence of diffuse bronchiectasis (P &lt;.0001) or serous otitis media (P &lt;.0001) were significantly more frequent in PCD patients than in patients carrying CFTR gene mutations or those without PCD or CFTR gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: ACS should be considered a remarkable entity in which congenital abnormalities of epithelial cells are frequently detected (55% of patients). The higher frequency of mutations in ACS patients compared with the general population suggests that heterozygoty for CFTR gene mutation could be a sinusitis-causing status.",M2
15051102,"[Nasal ciliary investigations for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in children]Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by chronic infections of the upper and lower airways, associated in 50% of cases with situs inversus, therefore, corresponding to Kartagener's syndrome. PCD is suspected on clinical features, including bronchitis, rhinosinusitis and chronic otitis media beginning in early childhood. The recurring infections eventually lead to bronchiectasis. The clinical features of PCD have been ascribed to primary defects in cilia, which lead to impairment of mucociliary clearance. Ciliary investigations looking for abnormalities in ciliary motion and ultrastructure can be easily performed at nasal level. Quantitative ultrastructural study of cilia is performed in cases of abnormal ciliary motion and/or clinical symptoms highly suggestive of PCD. In PCD, all or most of the cilia are abnormal, all bearing the same ultrastructural defects, mainly concerning dynein arms. In older children, the detection of a very low nasal NO output could also be useful for the diagnosis of PCD. As soon as the ciliary investigations are easy to perform at the nasal level, they could help for a better detection of PCD. This strategy could be especially useful in cases of atypical presentations, which are underestimated as a cause of recurrent airway infections. Diagnosis of PCD is important in order to prevent the development of bronchiectasis and to avoid any unnecessary procedure.",M2

Four patients reviewed in this paper were with typical disease history and clinical picture, as well as clear ciliary axonema damage. Complete examination was performed in all the patients, including bronchoscopy with bronchography, and the examination of the biopsy samples of respiratory airways' mucous membrane, obtained by transmission electron microscope (TEM). In two of the patients spermatozoa were also examined by TEM. Large anatomic defects of airways were found in all the patients, but pulmonary function was normal (except in one case), representing one of PCD's significant characteristics. First two cases fulfilled the criteria for Kartagener's syndrome, which was initially sufficient for the diagnosis of PCD.",M2

Although the incidence of PCD is low, early recognition and prompt management are important in order to prevent unnecessary morbidity, the progression of bronchiectasis and the deterioration of lung function. As the underlying defect in PCD cannot be corrected, the mainstay of therapy remains effective clearance of airway secretions and antibiotic therapy of respiratory tract infections. This paper highlights new developments in the field that have implications for the future management of PCD. These include beta-adrenergic agonists, arginine, uridine-5'-triphosphate, hypertonic saline and recombinant human DNase.

14960774,"Apparent X-linked primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with retinitis pigmentosa and a hearing loss.Three brothers, one 10-year-old and a pair of 14-year-old dizygotic twins--expressed the classical, early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with typical ophthalmoscopic findings, night blindness, visual field constricted to 10 degrees and flat ERG response. All three brothers were also diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) and had recurrent respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis. In all of them, resection of the middle lobe of the right lung was performed. A similar clinical picture of coexisting RP and PCD was noted in the brother of the probands' mother. All probands displayed situs solitus. Consistent with the X-linked mode of RP inheritance, there were also three obligatory female carriers of the disorder in this family: the mother of the affected boys, her mother and a daughter of her brother. In all of them, retinitis pigmentosa  sine pigmento  was found with milder but clinically significant symptoms (mild night blindness, visual field constricted to 30 degrees, and scotopic and photopic ERG responses reduced to 30-60%). No extraocular symptoms were detected in any of the heterozygous female carriers. This family presents an example of two rare phenomena: X-linked dominant retinitis pigmentosa (with milder expression in females) and a rare combination of RP with recurrent respiratory infections due to PCD.",M2

We hypothesized that the major clinical and biologic phenotypic markers of the disease could be evaluated by studying a cohort of subjects suspected of having PCD. Of 110 subjects evaluated, PCD was diagnosed in 78 subjects using a combination of compatible clinical features coupled with tests of ciliary ultrastructure and function. Chronic rhinitis/sinusitis (n = 78; 100%), recurrent otitis media (n = 74; 95%), neonatal respiratory symptoms (n = 57; 73%), and situs inversus (n = 43; 55%) are strong phenotypic markers of the disease. Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12; 15%) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (n = 8; 10%) were present in older (&gt; 30 years) patients with PCD. All subjects had defects in ciliary structure, 66% in the outer dynein arm. Nasal nitric oxide production was very low in PCD (nl/minute; 19 +/- 17 vs. 376 +/- 124 in normal control subjects). Rigorous clinical and ciliary phenotyping and measures of nasal nitric oxide are useful for the diagnosis of PCD. An increased awareness of the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for PCD will help lead to better diagnosis and care for this orphan disease.",M2
14630615,"Investigation of the possible role of a novel gene, DPCD, in primary ciliary dyskinesia.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations that affect the proper function of cilia. Recently, deletion of DNA polymerase lambda (Poll) in mice produced a phenotype characteristic of PCD (Kobayashi et al., 2002, Mol. Cell. Biol. 22:2769-2776). Because it is unclear how a mutation in a DNA polymerase would result in a specific defect in axonemes, the targeting construct was examined further. Analysis of the genomic region surrounding the Poll gene revealed an uncharacterized gene, named Dpcd, that is predicted to be transcribed from the opposite strand relative to Poll. The deletion of Poll would also remove the first exon of Dpcd. Because it is possible that the PCD phenotype observed is due to the absence of either gene, the expression of these genes during ciliogenesis of human airway epithelial cells was examined. Northern analysis demonstrated that DPCD expression increases during ciliated cell differentiation; the expression of POLL decreases. To examine directly whether DPCD is mutated in cases of human PCD, the complete coding sequence of DPCD was sequenced from 51 unrelated PCD patients. No disease-causing mutations were confirmed; however, one variant could not be excluded. Therefore, DPCD remains a novel candidate gene for PCD.",M2
13679810,"Ciliary beat pattern is associated with specific ultrastructural defects in primary ciliary dyskinesia.BACKGROUND: The main symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) are nasal rhinorrhea or blockage and moist-sounding cough. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on an abnormal ciliary beat frequency, accompanied by specific abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. It is unknown whether determining ciliary beat pattern related to specific ultrastructural ciliary defects might help in the diagnosis of PCD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency (CBF) associated with the 5 common ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD. METHODS: Nasal brushings were performed on 56 children with PCD. Ciliary movement was recorded using digital high-speed video imaging to assess beat frequency and pattern. Electron microscopy was performed. RESULTS: In patients with an isolated outer dynein arm or with an outer and inner dynein arm defect, 55% and 80% of cilia were immotile, respectively. Cilia that moved were only flickering. Mean CBF (+/- 95% CI) was 2.3 Hz (+/- 1.2) and 0.8 Hz(+/- 0.8), respectively. Cilia with an isolated inner dynein arm or a radial spoke defect had similar beat patterns. Cilia appeared stiff, had a reduced amplitude, and failed to bend along their length. Immotile cilia were present in 10% of cilia with an inner dynein arm defect and in 30% of radial spoke defects. Mean CBF was 9.3 Hz (+/- 2.6) and 6.0 Hz (+/- 3.1), respectively. The ciliary transposition defect produced a large circular beat pattern (mean CBF, 10.7 Hz [+/- 1.1]). No cilia were immotile. CONCLUSIONS: Different ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD result in predictable beat patterns. Recognition of these might help in the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having PCD.",M2

DESIGN: Single-center observational study. PATIENTS: Fifteen children with PCD (seven boys; mean [+/- SEM] age, 10.3 +/- 0.7 years; mean FEV(1), 73 +/- 2.1% predicted) were recruited along with 14 healthy age-matched subjects (seven boys; mean age, 11.5 +/- 0.4 years; mean FEV(1), 103 +/- 5% predicted). INTERVENTIONS: We assessed the levels of nitrite (NO(2)(-)), NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) (NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-)), and S-nitrosothiol in exhaled breath condensate, exhaled NO, and nasal NO from children with PCD compared to those in healthy children. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean exhaled and nasal NO levels were markedly decreased in children with PCD compared to those without PCD (3.2 +/- 0.2 vs 8.5 +/- 0.9 parts per billion [ppb], respectively [p &lt; 0.0001]; 59.6 +/- 12.2 vs 505.5 +/- 66.8 ppb, respectively [p &lt; 0.001]). Despite the lower levels of exhaled NO in children with PCD, no differences were found in the mean levels of NO(2)(-) (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs 3.5 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively), NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) (35.2 +/- 5.0 vs 34.3 +/- 4.5 microM, respectively), or S-nitrosothiol (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 microM, respectively) between children with PCD and healthy subjects.

Detailed investigation included gross anatomic dissection, review of the clinical history, and light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Clinically, this 40-year-old, long-surviving male patient had relatively good health until 4 years before death, which was due to cardiac failure. Surgical intervention consisted only of a Blalock-Taussig shunt (anastomosis of the right subclavian artery to the right pulmonary artery) at 6 years of age. Despite the presence of complex cardiac malformations and asplenia, his longevity may be attributed to the connection of the pulmonary veins to the atrium without pulmonary venous obstruction, pulmonary valvar stenosis rather than atresia, no significant atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and no serious infections during his life. Microscopic examination of bronchial epithelium revealed a narrow, disorganized epithelium with abundant goblet cells and short, angulated cilia with a random orientation and possibly an abnormal central microtubule doublet. These abnormalities were not present in controls, and have been noted in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) or Kartagener's syndrome. Because this syndrome has classically been thought to cause random lateralization resulting in a mirror-imaged arrangement of the organs, the occurrence of truly isomeric patterns is not widely recognized. Whereas polysplenia and left bronchial isomerism have been reported to occur in immotile cilia syndrome, this is the first report to present detailed postmortem anatomic evidence of isomerism of the right atrial appendages, right bronchial isomerism, and asplenia in association with microscopy suggesting ciliary abnormalities.",M2

12142464,"Mutations in the DNAH11 (axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11) gene cause one form of situs inversus totalis and most likely primary ciliary dyskinesia.Primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>; MIM 242650) is an autosomal recessive disorder of ciliary dysfunction with extensive genetic heterogeneity. PCD is characterized by bronchiectasis and upper respiratory tract infections, and half of the patients with PCD have situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome). We characterized the transcript and the genomic organization of the axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene, the human homologue of murine Dnah11 or lrd, which is mutated in the iv/iv mouse model with situs inversus. To assess the role of DNAH11, which maps on chromosome 7p21, we searched for mutations in the 82 exons of this gene in a patient with situs inversus totalis, and probable Kartagener syndrome associated with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (patUPD7). We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (R2852X) in the DNAH11 gene. This patient is remarkable because he is also homozygous for the F508del allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Sequence analysis of the DNAH11 gene in an additional 6 selected PCD sibships that shared DNAH11 alleles revealed polymorphic variants and an R3004Q substitution in a conserved position that might be pathogenic. We conclude that mutations in the coding region of DNAH11 account for situs inversus totalis and probably a minority of cases of PCD.",M2

METHODS: The levels of nNO and eNO were compared in 31 children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>), 21 with non-CF bronchiectasis (Bx), 17 with cystic fibrosis (CF), 35 with asthma (A), and 53 healthy controls (C) using a chemiluminescence NO analyser. A diagnostic receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for PCD using NO was constructed. RESULTS: The median (range) levels of nNO in parts per billion (ppb) in PCD, Bx, CF, and C were 60.3 (3.3-920), 533.6 (80-2053), 491.3 (31-1140), and 716 (398-1437), respectively; nNO levels were significantly lower in PCD than in all other groups (p&lt;0.05). The median (range) levels of eNO in ppb in PCD, Bx, CF, A, and C were 2.0 (0.2-5.2), 5.4 (1.0-22.1), 2.6 (0.8-12.9), 10.7 (1.6-46.7), and 4.85 (2.5-18.3), respectively. The difference in eNO levels in PCD reached significance (p&lt;0.05) when compared with those in Bx, A and C but not when compared with CF. Using the ROC curve, nNO of 250 ppb showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of PCD. CONCLUSIONS: eNO and nNO cannot be used diagnostically to distinguish between most respiratory diseases. However, nNO in particular is a quick and useful diagnostic marker which may be used to screen patients with a clinical suspicion of PCD.",M2

This syndrome is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, situs inversus and infertility. In some cases, hydrocephalus is also observed. We have characterized an insertional mutation in a mouse axonemal dynein heavy chain gene (Mdnah5) that reproduces most of the classical features of PCD, including recurrent respiratory infections, situs inversus and ciliary immotility. These mice also suffer from hydrocephalus and die perinatally. Electron microscopic studies demonstrate the loss of axonemal outer arms. These results show that mutations in Mdnah5 are a primary cause of PCD and provide direct evidence that mutations in an axonemal dynein can cause hydrocephalus. Mutations in the human DNAH5 have recently been identified in PCD patients. Comparison of the mouse model and the human data suggests that the degree of ciliary dysfunction is causally related to the severity of human PCD, particularly the presence of hydrocephalus.",M2

Samples of nasal ciliated epithelium from 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female; age-range 2-19 years) with severe chronic respiratory diseases were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based on TEM findings, patients were divided into two groups: A and B. Group A comprised 39 children with ciliary alterations compatible with a condition probably occurring secondary to chronic inflammation (alterations of peripheral pairs, swollen cilia, and compound cilia). The other 11 patients, Group B, exhibited a greater number of alterations of the central pair and dynein arms (p&lt; 0.001), which were qualitatively similar to, but less numerous than, those observed in primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>). In both groups, analysis of ciliary beat frequency and waveform was performed by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). All the children with a ciliary beat frequency of &lt; 7 Hz were treated with daily physiotherapy and with antibiotics, as recommended for PCD, for a 6-month period. After this treatment, the children were reexamined by PCM. Almost 50% of the children from Group B (i.e. those with a small proportion of specific ultrastructural defects) showed permanence of low ciliary beat frequency. This was also observed in two children of Group A. These children were considered to be affected by PCD. Our study describes a method for the diagnosis of PCD in the absence of specific ultrastructural defects or when these defects are present in only a small proportion of the cilia.",M2

Mutations in an intermediate chain dynein (DNAI1; IC78) have recently been described in PCD patients, with outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. The aims of the current study were to test for novel DNAI1 mutations in 13 PCD patients with ODA defects (from 7 unrelated families) and to assess genotype/phenotype correlations in patients and family members. A previously reported mutation (219+3insT) was detected in three PCD patients from two families. The opposite allele had the novel missense mutation G1874C (W568S) in both affected individuals from one family, and a nonsense mutation G1875A (W568X) in an affected individual from another family. The tryptophan at position 568 is a highly conserved residue in the WD-repeat region, and a mutation is predicted to lead to abnormal folding of the protein and loss of function. None of these mutations were found in 32 other PCD patients with miscellaneous ciliary defects. Mutations in DNAI1 are causative for PCD with ODA defects, and are likely the genetic origin of clinical disease in some PCD patients with ultrastructural defects in the ODA.",M2
11603792,"Ciliary function analysis for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia: advantages of ciliogenesis in culture.The gold standard for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (<e>PCD</e>) is a dynein deficiency shown with transmission electron microscopy. However, there are many cases of PCD without dynein deficiency. When considering ciliary function, there are similar problems of sensitivity in diagnosis and there is also a major lack of specificity. Based on the normal ciliary function and ultrastructure and the absence of secondary abnormalities after ciliogenesis in sequential monolayer-suspension culture, the diagnostic value of ciliary function analysis after ciliogenesis was investigated in more than 70 PCD and 640 non-PCD cases. In biopsies, ciliary immotility was found in 66% of PCD cases but was also found in 8% of non-PCD cases. PCD was later confirmed in 61% of the biopsies with ciliary immotility. Normal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was found in 20% of PCD biopsies. Coordinated ciliary activity was observed in 10% of PCD cases. After ciliogenesis in culture, ciliary immotility was present in 78% of the PCD cases but never in non-PCD cases. CBF was normal after ciliogenesis in 7% of the PCD cases and was always found in non-PCD cases. Absence of coordinated ciliary activity was found in 100% of PCD cases and 0% of non-PCD cases. In conclusion, while ciliary function analysis in a biopsy never proves, nor excludes the diagnosis of PCD, after ciliogenesis in culture CBF measurement can be diagnostic for PCD and reaches 100% specificity and sensitivity when considering coordinated ciliary activity, making it the single 100% diagnostic parameter for PCD.",M2

At the cell level, the disease phenotype includes various axonemal abnormalities of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. We have previously isolated DNAI1, the first gene involved in these diseases in patients lacking outer dynein arms. In this study, designed to find additional genes for other axonemal defects, we report the isolation of a novel human gene, hPF20, which is orthologous to Chlamydomonas pf20. The hPF20 gene is expressed as two major transcripts: one is expressed in testis only, whereas the second is weakly expressed in many other tissues. As flagella of Chlamydomonas strains carrying pf20 mutations lack the axonemal central complexes, we tested the involvement of the hPF20 gene in the disease phenotype of five patients in whom cilia or flagella display abnormal central complexes. Five intragenic polymorphisms were identified and used to exclude hPF20 in two consanguineous patients, while no mutation was found in the remaining patients.
