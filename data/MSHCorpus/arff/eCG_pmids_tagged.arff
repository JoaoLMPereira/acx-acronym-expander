20080296,"Equine chorionic gonadotropin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone enhance fertility in a norgestomet-based, timed artificial insemination protocol in suckled Nelore (Bos indicus) cows.Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) at progestin removal and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) at timed artificial insemination (TAI) on ovarian follicular dynamics (Experiment 1) and pregnancy rates (Experiment 2) in suckled Nelore (Bos indicus) cows. Both experiments were 2x2 factorials (eCG or No eCG, and GnRH or No GnRH), with identical treatments. In Experiment 1, 50 anestrous cows, 134.5+/-2.3 d postpartum, received a 3mg norgestomet ear implant sc, plus 3mg norgestomet and 5mg estradiol valerate im on Day 0. The implant was removed on Day 9, with TAI 54 h later. Cows received 400 IU eCG or no further treatment on Day 9 and GnRH (100 microg gonadorelin) or no further treatment at TAI. Treatment with eCG increased the growth rate of the largest follicle from Days 9 to 11 (means+/-SEM, 1.53+/-0.1 vs. 0.48+/-0.1mm/d; P&lt;0.0001), its diameter on Day 11 (11.4+/-0.6 vs. 9.3+/-0.7 mm; P=0.03), as well as ovulation rate (80.8% vs. 50.0%, P=0.02), whereas GnRH improved the synchrony of ovulation (72.0+/-1.1 vs. 71.1+/-2.0 h). In Experiment 2 (n=599 cows, 40 to 120 d postpartum), pregnancy rates differed (P=0.004) among groups (27.6%, 40.1%, 47.7%, and 55.7% for Control, GnRH, eCG, and eCG+GnRH groups). Both eCG and GnRH improved pregnancy rates (51.7% vs. 33.8%, P=0.002; and 48.0% vs 37.6%, P=0.02, respectively), although their effects were not additive (no significant interaction). In conclusion, eCG at norgestomet implant removal increased the growth rate of the largest follicle (LF) from implant removal to TAI, the diameter of the LF at TAI, and rates of ovulation and pregnancy rates. Furthermore, GnRH at TAI improved the synchrony of ovulations and pregnancy rates in postpartum Nelore cows treated with a norgestomet-based TAI protocol.",M1
20074876,"Progesterone-based estrous synchronization protocols in non-suckled and suckled primiparous Bos indicus beef cows.In Experiment 1, effects of an intravaginal progesterone insert (CIDR) for synchronization of estrus in non-suckled cycling primiparous Bos indicus beef cows were evaluated. Cows received either no treatment (Control), prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF), or CIDR (6 d) + prostaglandin F(2alpha) (CIDR + PGF). There were greater (P &lt; 0.05) percentages of cows inseminated and pregnant in 4 d of breeding season in CIDR + PGF (81.6%; 48.7%) than in PGF (53.8%; 32.5%) and Control cows (14.6%; 8.5%). In Experiment 2, efficacy of a treatment with CIDR (6 d) + prostaglandin F(2alpha) + 48 h temporary weaning (CIDR + PGF + TW) associated or not with equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) for synchronization of estrus in suckled primiparous B. indicus beef cows was evaluated. Cows were assigned to receive either no treatment (Control), CIDR + PGF + TW, CIDR + PGF + TW + 200 IU of eCG, or CIDR + PGF + TW + 400 IU of eCG. There were greater (P &lt; 0.05) percentages of insemination and pregnancy in 4 d of breeding season in treatment groups (47.0%; 27.5%) than in Control cows (4.5%; 3.0%) and in cows treated with eCG (50.9%; 29.4%) than in cows treated only with CIDR + PGF + TW (39.4%; 23.7%). No effects of eCG dosage were detected. The percentage of cows inseminated and pregnant in a 30 d breeding season were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in cows assigned to synchronization treatments (53.3%; 37.2%) than in Control cows (35.3%; 21.4%). In the beginning of the BS, non-suckled primiparous cows treated with CIDR + PGF with estrous cycles having been initiated following calving had greater estrous detection and pregnancy rates than PGF and Control cows, and suckled primiparous cows had improved estrous detection and pregnancy rates when eCG was associated with CIDR + PGF + TW.",M1
20031196,"Effect of equine chorionic gonadotropin on the efficiency of superovulation induction for in vivo and in vitro embryo production in the cat.The effects of various dosages of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) on superovulation induction for in vivo and in vitro embryo production were examined in stray cats (Felis catus). Cats (n=286) were allocated into five treatment groups with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 IU eCG, followed by 100 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In vivo- and in vitro-produced blastocysts were obtained by artificial insemination (AI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT), or parthenogenetic activation (PA). The percentage of cats that developed mature follicles, the percentage of cats with collected embryos, and the mean number of in vivo blastocysts per cat were higher in the 200 IU treatment group (43.9%, 31.8%, and 1.53, respectively) compared with those of the other groups (P&lt;0.05). The percentage of follicular developed cats, the percentage of cumulus-expanded oocytes, and the mean number of collected cumulus-oocyte complexes per cat in the 200 IU (56.7%, 67.8%, and 26.2, respectively) and 400 IU (53.3%, 64.2%, and 26.7, respectively) groups were higher than those in the other groups (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the percentage of in vitro-produced blastocyst per cleaved embryos and the average cell number of the blastocysts from IVF (52.7% and 125.8, respectively) was higher than those of the blastocysts from PA (30.1% and 85.2) and higher than those of the blastocysts from SCNT (15.3% and 37.5; P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that in vivo and in vitro embryo production were affected by the dosage of eCG; the best results were obtained with 200 IU.",M1
19874219,"Follicular development in pregnant cows after the administration of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>): a new insight.The follicular development in the cow occurs in a wave-like pattern, and it takes place also during pregnancy. In the cow, Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) is used for superovulation, but a decrease in total fertility has been reported, likely because of its immunogenic properties in species other than equine. In this regard, immune response has been implicated in follicular growth, ovulation, and placental development. So, aims of our study are to test the safety of eCG administered during pregnancy and characterize the ovarian activity, the quality of oocytes, the hormonal status, and interleukin levels in eCG-treated pregnant cows.",M1
19703990,"Gonadotropin stimulation increases the expression of angiotensin-(1--7) and MAS receptor in the rat ovary.We have previously shown the presence of immunoreactive angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in rat ovary homogenate and its stimulatory effect on estradiol and progesterone production in vitro. In the current study, we investigated the presence and cellular distribution of Ang-(1-7) and the Mas receptor, the expression of Mas and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) messenger RNA (mRNA), and the enzymatic activity in the rat ovary following gonadotropin stimulation in vivo. Immature female Wistar rats (25 days old) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>, 20 IU in 0.2 mL) or vehicle 48 hours before euthanasia. Tissue distributions of Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor, and ACE2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, along with angiotensin II (Ang II) localization, while the mRNA expression levels of Mas receptor and ACE2 were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we determined the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and ACE by fluorometric assays. After eCG treatment, we found strong immunoreactivity for Ang-(1-7) and Mas primarily in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II appeared in the granulosa but not in the thecal layer. Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment increased Mas and ACE2 mRNA expression compared with control animals (3.3- and 2.1-fold increase, respectively; P &lt; .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme and NEP activities were lower, while PEP activity was higher in the eCG-treated rats (P &lt; .05). These data show gonadotropin-induced changes in the ovarian expression of Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor, and ACE2. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) branch formed by ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas, fully expressed in the rat ovary and regulated by gonadotropic hormones, could play a role in the ovarian physiology.",M1
19559472,"Strategies to improve fertility in Bos indicus postpubertal heifers and nonlactating cows submitted to fixed-time artificial insemination.Two experiments were designed to evaluate strategies to increase fertility of Bos indicus postpubertal heifers and nonlactating cows submitted to a fixed-time artificial insemination (TAI) protocol consisting of an intravaginal device containing 1.9 g of progesterone (CIDR) insertion+estradiol benzoate on Day 0, CIDR withdrawal+estradiol cypionate on Day 9, and TAI on Day 11. In Experiment 1, heifers (n=1153) received a new or an 18-d previously used CIDR and, on Day 9, prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha))+0, 200, or 300 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>). Heifers treated with a new CIDR had greater (least squares means+/-SEM) serum concentration of progesterone on Day 9 (3.06+/-0.09 ng/mL vs. 2.53+/-0.09 ng/mL; P&lt;0.05) and a smaller follicle at TAI (11.61+/-0.11 mm vs. 12.05+/-0.12 mm; P&lt;0.05). Heifers with smaller follicles at TAI had lesser serum progesterone concentrations on Day 18 and reduced rates of ovulation, conception, and pregnancy (P&lt;0.05). Treatment with eCG improved (P&lt;0.05) follicle diameter at TAI (11.50+/-0.10mm, 11.90+/-0.11 mm, and 12.00+/-0.10mm for 0, 100, and 200 IU, respectively), serum progesterone concentration on Day 18 (2.77+/-0.11 ng/mL, 3.81+/-0.11 ng/mL, and 4.87+/-0.11 ng/mL), and rates of ovulation (83.8%, 88.5%, and 94.3%) and pregnancy (41.3%, 47.0%, and 46.7%). In Experiment 2, nonlactating Nelore cows (n=702) received PGF(2 alpha) treatment on Days 7 or 9 and, on Day 9, 0 or 300 IU eCG. Cows receiving PGF(2 alpha) on Day 7 had lesser serum progesterone concentrations on Day 9 (3.05+/-0.21 ng/mL vs. 4.58+/-0.21 ng/mL; P&lt;0.05), a larger follicle at TAI (11.54+/-0.21 mm vs. 10.84+/-0.21 mm; P&lt;0.05), and improved (P&lt;0.05) rates of ovulation (85.4% vs. 77.0%), conception (60.9% vs. 47.2%), and pregnancy (52.0% vs. 36.4%). Treatment with eCG improved (P&lt;0.05) serum progesterone concentration on Day 18 (3.24+/-0.14 ng/mL vs. 4.55+/-0.14 ng/mL) and the rates of ovulation (72.4% vs. 90.0%) and pregnancy (37.5% vs. 50.8%). In conclusion, giving PGF(2 alpha) earlier in the protocol in nonlactating cows and eCG treatment in postpubertal heifers and nonlactating cows improved fertility in response to a TAI (progesterone+estradiol) protocol.",M1
19477500,"Progesterone concentrations, exogenous equine chorionic gonadotropin, and timing of prostaglandin F(2alpha) treatment affect fertility in postpuberal Nelore heifers.Two experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that elevated progesterone concentrations impair pregnancy rate to timed artificial insemination (TAI) in postpuberal Nelore heifers. In Experiment 1, postpuberal Nelore heifers (n=398) received 2mg estradiol benzoate (EB) and either a new progesterone-releasing intravaginal device containing 1.9g of progesterone (CIDR) (first use) or a CIDR previously used for 9 d (second use) or for 18 d (third use) on Day 0, 12.5mg prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) on Day 7, 0.5mg estradiol cypionate (ECP) and CIDR withdrawal on Day 9, and TAI on Day 11. Largest ovarian follicle diameter was determined on Day 11. The third-use CIDR treatment increased largest ovarian follicle diameter and pregnancy rate. Conception to TAI was reduced in heifers with smaller follicles in the first- and second-use CIDR treatments, but not in the third-use CIDR treatment. In Experiment 2, postpuberal Nelore heifers received the synchronization treatment described in Experiment 1 or received 12.5mg PGF(2alpha) on Day 9 rather than Day 7. In addition, 50% of heifers received 300 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) on Day 9. Heifers were either TAI (Experiment 2a; n=199) or AI after detection of estrus (Experiment 2b; n=125 of 202). In Experiment 2a, treatment with eCG increased pregnancy rate to TAI in heifers that received PGF(2alpha) on Day 9 but not on Day 7 and in heifers that received a first-use CIDR but not in heifers that received a third-use CIDR. Treatments did not influence reproductive performance in Experiment 2b. In summary, pregnancy rate to TAI in postpuberal Nelore heifers was optimized when lower concentrations of exogenous progesterone were administered, and eCG treatment was beneficial in heifers expected to have greater progesterone concentrations.",M1
19328472,"Intrabursal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor trap in <e>eCG</e>-treated prepubertal rats inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of follicular cells involving the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of local inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) on proliferation and apoptosis of follicular cells in rat ovaries. To analyze the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on VEGFA effects. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Female Sprague Dawley rats, 21 days old, treated with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Follicular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway after intrabursal injection of a VEGFA inhibitor. RESULT(S): Inhibition of VEGFA leads to a decrease in the expression of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in theca and granulosa cells (GC) and an increase in the activation of caspase 3 in antral follicles. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and its target Bcl2 antagonist of cell death (BAD). No differences were found in the levels of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) protein or in endothelial cell density. CONCLUSION(S): The VEGFA prevents apoptosis and stimulates proliferation of follicular cells, regulating follicular growth and development. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is one of the pathways involved in this mechanism. Therefore, VEGFA has a role as an antiapoptotic and proliferative factor in follicular cells from the rat ovary.",M1
19269685,"Effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin and type of ovulatory stimulus in a timed-AI protocol on reproductive responses in dairy cows.The objectives were to evaluate the effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) supplementation (with or without eCG) and type of ovulatory stimulus (GnRH or ECP) on ovarian follicular dynamics, luteal function, and pregnancies per AI (P/AI) in Holstein cows receiving timed artificial insemination (TAI). On Day 0, 742 cows in a total of 782 breedings, received 2mg of estradiol benzoate (EB) and one intravaginal progesterone (P4) insert (CIDR). On Day 8, the CIDR was removed, and all cows were given PGF2 alpha and assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement: (1) CG: GnRH 48 h later; (2) CE: ECP; (3) EG: eCG+GnRH 48 h later; (4) EE: eCG+ECP. There were significant interactions for eCG x ovulatory stimulus and eCG x BCS. Cows in the CG group were less likely (28.9% vs. 33.8%; P&lt;0.05) to become pregnant compared with those in the EG group (odds ratio [OR]=0.28). There were no differences in P/AI between CE and EE cows (30.9% vs. 29.1%; OR=0.85; P=0.56), respectively. Thinner cows not receiving eCG had lower P/AI than thinner cows receiving eCG (15.2% vs. 38.0%; OR=0.20; P&lt;0.01). Treatment with eCG tended to increase serum progestesterone concentrations during the diestrus following synchronized ovulation (P&lt;0.10). However, the treatment used to induce ovulation did not affect CL volume or serum progesterone concentrations. In conclusion, both ECP and GnRH yielded comparable P/AI. However, eCG treatment at CIDR removal increased pregnancy rate in cows induced to ovulate with GnRH and in cows with lower BCS.",M1
19202320,"Dexamethasone enhances fertility and preovulatory serum prolactin levels in <e>eCG</e>/hCG primed immature rats.Glucocorticoids have heterogeneous effects on reproductive function. We used a gonadotropin-primed, immature rat model to study the influence of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), given during the latter stages of follicular development, on litter size, the number of oocytes released, and pituitary hormone levels. Dexamethasone-treated females released a larger number of oocytes at ovulation and gave birth to larger litters indicating the oocytes were viable. Survival to weaning age was not affected but average weight at weaning was lower for pups born to DEX-treated females. Serum FSH and LH were assayed at 12, 24 and 48 h following eCG and did not differ between dexamethasone-treated and control animals, but prolactin showed a prolonged pattern of elevation in DEX-treated females. Prolactin, which normally exhibits an elevation on proestrous, may modulate follicular development. Dexamethasone enhances fertility and fecundity possible through an effect of prolactin on follicle development, or by other direct effects on the ovary. These results may improve our understanding of the usefulness of DEX in assisted reproductive therapies for women.",M1
19144021,"Effects of gonadotropins on in vitro maturation and of electrical stimulation on parthenogenesis of canine oocytes.The objective of this study was to determine the effects of gonadotropins on in vitro maturation (IVM) and electrical stimulation on the parthenogenesis of canine oocytes. In experiment I, cumulus oocyte complexes were collected from ovaries at a random phase of the oestrus cycle and cultured on maturation medium treated with hCG or <e>eCG</e> for 48 or 72 h. There were no significant differences in the effects on the metaphase II (MII) rate between the hCG and eCG treatment groups over 48 h (5.4% vs 5.5%). The MII rate in the co-treatment group of hCG and eCG for 48 h was higher than in each hormone treated group (15.5%, p &lt; 0.05). In experiment 2, the parthenogenetic effect on oocyte development, at various electrical field strengths (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 kV/cm DC) for 60 or 80 mus with a single DC pulse after IVM on the co-treatment of hCG and eCG, was examined. The rate of pronuclear formation (37.1%) in electrical activation at 1.5 kV/60 mus without cytochalasin B (CB) was higher than that of oocytes activated in the other groups (p &lt; 0.05). However, we did not observe the cleavage stages. Also, CB did not influence parthenogenesis of canine oocytes. The results showed that the pronucleus formation rate, indicative of the parthenogenesis start point, could be increased by electrical stimulation. Therefore, these results can provide important data for the parthenogenesis of canine oocytes and suggest the probability of parthenogenesis in canines.",M1
19117969,"Inhibition of ovulation by a lipoxygenase inhibitor involves reduced cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production in gonadotropin-primed immature rats.Potential roles of cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism are established in a murine model of induced ovulation. Pharmacological inhibition of an alternative lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway has been shown to cause defective ovulation, but the mechanism is still undefined. This study investigated the effects of two LOX inhibitors and their time dependency on ovulation and COX activity in gonadotropins (<e>eCG</e> and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG))-primed immature rats. Intra-ovarian bursal treatment with a general LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) at 0 h post-hCG (hCG0h) dose dependently inhibited ovulation rate. The drug was still but less effective when treated at hCG6h. A more specific inhibitor, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol (DPE) was also inhibitory when treated at hCG0h but not at hCG6h. Interestingly, treatment with DPE at hCG0h resulted in attenuated expression of immunoreactive PTGS2 in granulosa layers and concomitant decrease in ovarian prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) content at hCG8h. NDGA treatment reduced immunoreactive PTGS2. Ovulatory impairment by both inhibitors was prevented by systemic administration of PGE(2) at hCG6h. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of ALOX5 and ALOX12 in both thecal and granulosa layers of preovulatory follicles and, notably, the augmented immunoreactivities during 8 h after hCG treatment. Our results indicate the probable presence of multiple LOX isoforms and that specific inhibition of LOX at an early stage of hCG-signaling led to reduced PTGS2 activity and thus defective ovulation. They reveal a probable relationship between two pathways of AA metabolism and account at least partly for the mechanism by which the LOX inhibitor causes impaired ovulation.",M1
18619746,"Relationships between ovarian blood flow and ovarian response to <e>eCG</e>-treatment of dairy cows.The goal of the present study was to investigate ovarian blood flow and ovarian response in cows undergoing a gonadotropin treatment to induce a superovulatory response, using transrectal colour Doppler sonography. Forty-two cows including 19 cross-bred, 14 German Holstein and 9 German Black Pied cows were examined sonographically before hormonal stimulation on Day 10 of the oestrous cycle, three days after administration of eCG (Day 13) and seven days after artificial insemination (Day 7(p.i.)). After each Doppler examination, blood was collected for determination of total oestrogens (E) and progesterone (P4) in peripheral plasma. The blood flow volume (BFV) and pulsatility index (PI), which is a measure for blood flow resistance, were determined in the ovarian artery, and B-mode sonography was used to count dominant follicles and corpora lutea. Important criteria to assess the ovarian response following the hormonal treatment were the number of follicles &gt;5mm in diameter on Day 13 and the number of corpora lutea on Day 7(p.i.) per cow. The number of follicles ranged from 2 to 61 (mean+/-S.E.M.: 17.5+/-1.7) and corpora lutea from 0 to 50 (mean+/-S.E.M.: 17.0+/-1.6). The BFV increased from 28.4 to 45.0 ml/min between Days 10 and 13 and reached a maximum of 108.5 ml/min on Day 7(p.i.) The PI decreased from 6.25 on Day 10 to 4.70 on Day 13 and to 2.10 on Day 7(p.i.) The BFV and PI on Day 13 did not correlate with the number of follicles (P&gt;0.05). However, on Day 7(p.i.) the number of corpora lutea correlated positively with the BFV (r=0.64; P&lt;0.0001), and an inverse relationship was found for the PI (r=-0.51; P=0.0005). There were no correlations (P&gt;0.05) between the BFV and PI on Day 10 and the number of follicles on Day 13 or the number of corpora lutea on Day 7(p.i.) Results of the present study show that in cows, a hormonal treatment to induce a superovulatory response yielded a marked increase in BFV and a marked decrease in PI in the ovarian artery. However, there was no correlation between BFV and PI in the ovarian arteries before hormonal stimulation and the number of follicles and corpora lutea that developed after stimulation. Thus BFV and PI measured in the ovarian arteries have limited diagnostic value to predict the outcome of a gonadotropin treatment.",M1
18577358,"Synchronisation of canine germinal vesicle stage oocytes prior to in vitro maturation alters the kinetics of nuclear progression during subsequent resumption of meiosis.Inhibition of meiosis before in vitro maturation (IVM) can improve meiotic competence in immature mammalian oocytes. Therefore, meiosis-inhibiting agents were evaluated singularly for the ability to arrest and synchronise germinal vesicle (GV) stage canine oocytes, and the most effective treatments were combined to improve meiotic resumption rates. Oocytes cultured in 2 ng mL(-1) oestradiol (E2), 10 IU mL(-1) <e>eCG</e>, or both (EG) for 72 h resulted in significantly fewer oocytes resuming meiosis in EG than the control, E2, or with eCG. Oocytes cultured in 50 or 100 micromol L(-1) of butyrolactone 1 or roscovitine (ROS) for up to 48 h did not resume meiosis nor increase subsequent meiotic resumption rates following IVM. A combination of 50 micromol L(-1) ROS and EG treatment for 48 h significantly increased the proportion of canine oocytes in meiotic arrest. More importantly, following 48 h of IVM, ROS+EG-treated oocytes demonstrated a dramatic increase in the ability to resume meiosis compared with the non-treated controls (51.3 +/- 8.2% and 10.8 +/- 4.5%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). These data indicate that chemical and biological meiotic inhibitors are effective at inducing GV arrest in canine oocytes. Furthermore, these inhibitors are reversible and beneficial to subsequent meiotic resumption in vitro.",M1
18534792,"GnRH or <e>eCG</e> treatment fails to restore reproductive function in GnRH immunized ewes.This study was designed to evaluate the potential of using eCG or GnRH in restoring reproductive functions in GnRH immunized ewes. Thirty-three multiparous Kivircik ewes were randomly assigned into either control group (n=11) or immunization group (n=22). Ewes were immunized against GnRH by injecting with a cocktail of ovalbumin-LHRH-7 (ovalbumin-GnRH-7) and thioredoxin-LHRH-7 (thioredoxin-GnRH-7) fusion proteins generated by recombinant DNA technology in April. 500 IU eCG or 0.008 mg GnRH analogue was used to induce ovulations. Serum GnRH antibodies were present in animals of the immunized group beginning the second week after the first immunization and maintained throughout the study (14 months). Immunization caused anestrus in immunized ewes. eCG or GnRH analogue administration given after 14 days progestagen (20 mg fluorogestone acetate, FGA) treatment during breeding season (mid July) did not induce ovulation in these ewes. Two more attempts with single or multiple eCG injections failed to induce ovulation in this group as well. It appears that the gonadotropin stimulation was not of adequate time since neither eCG nor GnRH administration was able to restore reproductive function in immunized animals. The immunization effect lasted more than a year. These results suggest that GnRH immunization exerts its effect via the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and that more than such stimulation is required to overcome the reproductive suppression.",M1
18501957,"Effects of melengestrol acetate and P.G. 600 on fertility in Rambouillet ewes outside the natural breeding season.The effects of melengestrol acetate (MGA) and P.G. 600 on ewe fertility outside the natural breeding season were evaluated. Rambouillet ewes were assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (C; n=92); (2) PG600 (n=86); (3) MGA (n=99); and (4) MGA+PG600 (n=92). A pellet with or without MGA (0.3mg/ewe/d) was fed at 0.15kg/ewe/d for 7d. On the last day of pellet feeding, ewes were given either saline or 5mL of P.G. 600 i.m. (400IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) and 200IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)). Ultrasonography was performed between Days 20 and 25 of gestation for ewes that were mated during the first 6 d of the breeding period from the MGA (n=15) and MGA+PG600 (n=8) groups, and the number of luteal structures and embryos were counted. During the first 6d of the breeding period, MGA increased (P&lt;0.05) the percentage of ewes that mated and conceived when compared to C and PG600 (24.2% vs. 3.3% and 10.5%, respectively). Relative to MGA, the mean (+/-S.E.M.) number of luteal structures per ewe was enhanced (P&lt;0.03) in MGA+PG600 (1.53+/-0.13 vs. 2.38+/-0.42, respectively), however as pregnancy progressed, the number of embryos (1.5+/-0.13 vs. 1.8+/-0.16, respectively) and lambs born (1.3+/-0.15 vs. 1.5+/-0.27, respectively) did not differ. Treatment with MGA reduced (P&lt;0.01) the interval from ram introduction to lambing relative to groups that did not receive MGA (168+/-0.8d vs. 171+/-0.6d, respectively). In conclusion, treatment with MGA increased the percentage of ewes conceiving early in the breeding period.

18456902,"Sequential exposure of porcine cumulus cells to FSH and/or LH is critical for appropriate expression of steroidogenic and ovulation-related genes that impact oocyte maturation in vivo and in vitro.In this study, we collected follicular fluid, granulosa cells, and cumulus cells from antral follicles at specific time intervals following equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment of gilts. The treatment with eCG increased the production of estrogen coordinately with up-regulated proliferation of granulosa and cumulus cells. eCG also induced the expression of LHCGR and PGR in cumulus cells and progesterone accumulation was detected in follicular fluid prior to the LH/hCG surge. Moreover, progesterone and progesterone receptor (PGR) were critical for FSH-induced LHCGR expression in cumulus cells in culture. The expression of LHCGR mRNA in cumulus cells was associated with the ability of LH to induce prostaglandin production, release of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like factors, and a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin-like repeats 1 expression, promoting cumulus cell oocyte complexes (COCs) expansion and oocyte maturation. Based on the unique expression and regulation of PGR and LHCGR in cumulus cells, we designed a novel porcine COCs culture system in which hormones were added sequentially to mimic changes observed in vivo. Specifically, COCs from small antral follicles were pre-cultured with FSH and estradiol for 10 h at which time progesterone was added for another 10 h. After 20 h, COCs were moved to fresh medium containing LH, EGF, and progesterone. The oocytes matured in this revised COC culture system exhibited greater developmental competence to blastocyst stage. From these results, we conclude that to achieve optimal COC expansion and oocyte maturation in culture the unique gene expression patterns in cumulus cells of each species need to be characterized and used to increase the effectiveness of hormone stimulation.",M1
18372407,"Stability and biological activities of heterodimeric and single-chain equine LH/chorionic gonadotropin variants.Recombinant equine LH/chorionic gonadotropin (eLH/CG) was expressed in the baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system either as a single-chain with the C-terminus of the beta-subunit fused to the N-terminus of the alpha-subunit or as non-covalently linked heterodimers with or without a polyhistidine tag at various locations. All these non-covalently linked eLH/CG variants were secreted as stable heterodimers in the medium of infected Sf9 cells. To assess the influence of the presence and the position of polyhistidine tag on LH bioactivity, we expressed four non-covalently linked tagged heterodimeric eLH/CG variants that were secreted in threefold higher quantities than the single chain. Among them, only two exhibited full in vitro LH bioactivity, relative to untagged heterodimers, namely the one His-tagged at the N-terminus of alpha-subunit and the other at the C-terminus of the beta-subunit both of which are amenable to nickel-affinity purification. Furthermore, single-chain eLH/CG was found to be N- and O-glycosylated but nevertheless less active in in vitro LH bioassays than natural <e>eCG</e> and heterodimeric recombinant eLH/CG. The thermal stability of natural and recombinant hormones was assessed by the initial rates of dissociation from 20 to 90 degrees C. Heterodimeric eLH/CG from Sf9 cells was found to be as stable as pituitary eLH and serum eCG (T(1/2), 74-77 degrees C). Although Sf9 cells only elaborated short immature-type carbohydrate side chains on glycoproteins, recombinant eLH/CG produced in these cells exhibited stabilities similar to that of pituitary eLH. In conclusion, recombinant heterodimeric eLH/CG exhibits the same thermal stability as natural pituitary LH and its advantages over the single-chain eLH/CG include higher secretion, higher in vitro bioactivity, and reduced potential risk of immunogenicity.",M1
18294785,"Effects of <e>eCG</e> and FSH on ovarian response, recovery rate and number and quality of oocytes obtained by ovum pick-up in Holstein cows.The goal of the present study was to compare the ovarian response, oocyte yields per animal, and the morphological quality of oocytes collected by ultrasound guided follicular aspiration from Holstein cows treated either with FSH or eCG. Twenty four normal cyclic, German Holstein cows were randomly divided into two groups. Fourteen cows received 3000 IU eCG on day-4 prior to ovum pick-up (OPU) (day 0), 2 days later (day-2), 625 microg cloprostenol was administered. On day-1 GnRH was administered i.m. and 24h later OPU (day 0) was performed. In ten cows a total dose of 500 IU follicle stimulating hormone (Pluset) was administered intramuscularly in a constant dosage for 4 days with intervals of 12h, starting on day-5. Luteolysis was induced by application of 625 microg cloprostenol on day-2. On day-1 (24h after the last FSH treatment) GnRH was administered i.m. and 24h later OPU (day 0) was performed. Ovarian follicles were visualized on the ultrasound monitor, counted and recorded. All visible antral follicles were punctured. Recovered oocytes were graded morphologically based on the cumulus investment. Average follicle number in ovaries was higher in FSH group than eCG group (p&lt;0.05). Oocyte yields per animal did not differ between FSH and eCG groups. The proportion of grade A oocytes was higher in the FSH group in the than eCG group (p&lt;0.05). Likewise, rate of grade C oocytes in FSH group were lower than eCG group (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that ovarian response, follicle number in ovaries and oocyte quality are affected by the type of gonadotropin and FSH is better alternative than eCG for OPU treatment.",M1
18282669,"Effect of prior FSH treatment on the estrus and ovulation responses to <e>eCG</e> in prepubertal gilts.The objective of this study was to determine the effect of pre-treatment of prepubertal gilts with FSH on the estrus and ovulatory responses to eCG injection at two ages. A total of 149 prepubertal Hypor gilts were selected at 150 days (n=76) or 180 days (n=73) of age and assigned to injection of 400 IU eCG plus 200 IU hCG (PG600), 600IU eCG alone (Folligon), pre-treatment with 72 mg FSH (Folltropin) administered as 6 x 12 mg injections at 12 h intervals with 600 IU Folligon 12h after last FSH injection, or non-injected controls. To facilitate detection of estrus, gilts were exposed to a mature boar for 15 min daily for 7 days. To determine ovulatory responses, blood samples were obtained on the day of injection and 10 days later and assayed for progesterone content. Following treatment at 150 days, one control gilt (5.3%) was deemed estrus but ovulation did not occur. Compared to treatment with Folligon alone, PG600 injection tended (P=0.1) to increase the estrus response (52.6% compared with. 26.3%) and increased (P&lt;0.01) the ovulatory response (89.5% compared with. 47.4%). The estrous response in gilts pretreated with Folltropin was intermediate (42.1%) but the ovulatory response (47.4%) was the same as for Folligon alone. Following treatment at 180 days, two control gilts (10.5%) were deemed estrus and ovulation did occur in these gilts. There was no difference between hormone-treated groups for estrus or ovulatory responses, although the ovulatory response of PG600-treated gilts tended (P=0.1) to be greater than for the Folligon-treated group (89.5% compared with 66.7%), with Folltropin-pretreated gilts being intermediate (76.5%). These data demonstrate that the estrus and ovulatory responses of gilts were greater for PG600 than for Folligon and that while responses to PG600 were not affected by gilt age, for the combined Folligon groups, estrous response (P&lt;0.02) and ovulatory response (P&lt;0.05) improved with increased gilt age.",M1

Lambs were weighed and scrotal circumference was registered every 2 weeks since birth until 170 days of age (end of experiment). On days 125 and 167 semen was collected using an electroejaculator. Semen volume and concentration, mass and individual sperm motility (scale 0 to 5) and total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate were recorded. The sexual behaviour of the lambs was evaluated twice, on days 127 and 170 in a pen test with oestrous ewes. There were no significant effects of treatment on body weight or scrotal circumference, semen characteristics or sexual behaviour. At least in the administration regimens tested, eCG treatment has no effect on prepubertal reproductive development of male lambs.",M1
17976065,"Pregnancy rate obtained with short-term protocol for timed artificial insemination in goats.Recent studies demonstrated that the Short-term Protocol of 5 days of progestogen treatment plus one dose of prostaglandin F(2alpha) and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) resulted in a close synchronized ovulation (60 h after the end of treatment approximately). In addition, oestradiol benzoate (ODB) is effective in synchronizing ovulation in goats and could be an alternative to eCG. This study was performed to determine the pregnancy rate using the Short-term Protocol comparing: (i) two different moments of timed artificial insemination (TAI) after eCG treatment (trial 1) and (ii) ODB as an alternative to eCG treatment (trial 2). In trial 1, 250 IU of eCG was given at the end of progestogen exposure, and cervical TAI with fresh semen was performed 48 h (n = 156) or 54 h (n = 168) later. In trial 2, 250 IU of eCG was given at sponge withdrawal (eCG group, n = 154) or 200 mug of ODB was given 24 h later (ODB group, n = 119). TAI was performed 54 h after the end of progestogen treatment. Pregnancy rate was determined by transrectal ultrasonography. In trial 1, the pregnancy rate for goats with TAI performed at 54 h (107/168, 63.7%) was higher than for those with TAI performed 48 h (77/156, 49.4%; p &lt; 0.05) after sponge withdrawal. In trial 2, pregnancy rate was higher in eCG (94/154, 61.0%) than in ODB (49/119, 40.3%; p &lt; 0.05) treated goats.

17965258,"Effect of direct ovarian injection of vascular endothelial growth factor gene fragments on follicular development in immature female rats.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in granulosa cells is associated with the thecal vasculature growth during ovarian follicular development. We hypothesized that injection of VEGF gene fragments directly into the rat ovary would induce production of a large number of ovulatory follicles and that these follicles would ovulate. To test this hypothesis, we treated immature female rats with combinations of hormones and VEGF gene fragments. The animals were divided into two groups: one group received solution containing transfection reagents as a control (n = 5), while the other group received direct ovarian injection of VEGF gene fragments at 19 (n = 5), 21 (n = 5), 23 (n = 5), or 25 (n = 5) days after birth followed by i.p. administration of 20 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) at the age of 26 days. Forty-eight hours after eCG injection, animals were given 20 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) i.p. and then the oocytes in both groups were counted. The maximum number of ovulated oocytes was obtained when the VEGF gene fragments were injected into the rat ovary at 21 days after birth. Histological examination revealed that the injection of VEGF gene fragments markedly increased the vascular density around the preovulatory follicles and also the number of these follicles. Our data provide the first reported evidence that most ovulatory follicles generated by injection of VEGF gene fragments are able to ovulate upon hCG treatment. These results demonstrate that injection of VEGF gene fragments directly into the ovary stimulates the development of antral follicles by inducing the formation of thecal vasculature in immature female rats.",M1
17953982,"Alternative approaches to setting up donor cows for superstimulation.Protocols that controlled follicular wave emergence and ovulation have had a great impact on the application of on-farm embryo transfer, as they permitted the initiation of superstimulatory treatments at a self-appointed time. However, the most commonly used approach for synchronization of follicular wave emergence involved estradiol, which cannot be used in many countries. Therefore, alternative treatments are required. Mechanical removal of the dominant follicle by ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration was effective, but required the use of specialized equipment and trained technical staff, which made it difficult to utilize in the field. Exogenous GnRH or pLH have also been used to induce ovulation of a dominant follicle, synchronizing follicular wave emergence, but their efficacy was dependent on the stage of the dominant follicle at treatment; thus, the emergence of the ensuing follicular wave may be too variable for superstimulation. An alternative approach could be initiating treatments at the time of emergence of the first follicular wave, but the need to synchronize ovulation may be a disadvantage in groups of donors at random stages of the estrous cycle. The final alternative may be to use FSH or <e>eCG</e> to initiate a new wave, without regard to the presence of a dominant follicle, followed by superstimulatory treatment at a predetermined time. All alternatives need to be thoroughly investigated in order to confirm their utility in the superstimulation of donor cows, regardless of the stage of the estrous cycle and without compromising ova/embryo production.",M1
17644284,"In vivo evidence of role of bone morphogenetic protein-4 in the mouse ovary.The transition of a primordial follicle to a primary follicle is an early step in folliculogenesis. All female mammals are born with a fixed stock of primordial follicles, and exhaustion of that stock leads to menopause or infertility. Recently, several in vitro studies have indicated that BMP-4, BMP-7, and several other growth factors affect the transition of primordial to primary follicles. The aim of our present study was to investigate role of BMP-4 in this process using passive immunization to investigate the role of BMP-4 in a prepubertal mouse model. After seven days of treatment, the weight of antiBMP-4 treated ovaries was significantly lower than the ovaries from mice treated with nonimmune Ig. The number of primary follicles was lower, and the numbers of primordial follicles were higher in antiBMP-4 treated ovaries compared to control ovaries. Treatment with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) showed no influence on the effects of antiBMP-4 in the mouse ovary. Thus, the results of our study indicate that in vivo BMP-4 acts as transition factor in transition of primordial to primary follicle.",M1
17635777,"Ultrasonographic characteristics of ovulatory follicles and associated endocrine changes in cyclic ewes treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP)-releasing intravaginal sponges and equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>).The aim of this study was to assess the ultrasonographic characteristics of ovulatory follicles in cyclic Western White Face ewes (December) that had received intravaginal sponges containing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP; 60 mg) for 12 days, with or without an injection of 500 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) at sponge removal. We hypothesized that quantitative echotextural attributes of the follicles in ewes treated only with MAP would differ from those in MAP/eCG-treated ewes, reflecting the increased antral follicular growth and secretory function under eCG influence. Digital images of ovulatory follicles obtained at 0 and 24 h after MAP sponge removal and at 24 h before ovulation in the eCG-treated (five ewes, 13 follicles) and control (six ewes, 9 follicles) animals, were subjected to computerized analyses. The mean diameter of ovulatory follicles increased (p &lt; 0.001) 24 h after eCG treatment. The mean pixel intensity and heterogeneity of the follicular antrum (p &lt; 0.001), as well as mean pixel intensity of the follicular wall and perifollicular ovarian stroma (p &lt; 0.05), were greater in eCG-treated animals compared with control ewes 24 h after sponge removal and at 24 h before ovulation. Mean serum concentrations of oestradiol-17beta tended to increase (p = 0.06) 24 h after eCG treatment and the eCG-treated ewes exceeded (p &lt; 0.05) control animals in progesterone concentrations from days 9-15 after ovulation. Our results support the hypothesis that large antral follicles in eCG-treated ewes exhibit distinctive echotextural characteristics. Follicular image attributes in eCG-treated ewes appear to be indicative of the changes in follicular morphology and secretory activity caused by the administration of the exogenous gonadotropin, which has both FSH- and LH-like activities.",M1
17573210,"Control of postpartum anestrous with an intra-vaginal progesterone device plus <e>eCG</e> or calf removal for 120 h in suckled crossbred cows managed in a pasture-based system.To control postpartum anestrus and reduce calving to conception interval, 167 crossbred non-pregnant cows that were 90-130 days postpartum were allotted randomly to one of the following treatments: PH (n=59), intra-vaginal sponge with 250 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) for 7 days plus 50mg of MAP and 5mg 17-beta estradiol (17beta-E) in the first day of treatment (day -8), 500 UI eCG (day -3) and 1.5mg 17beta-E in 24h after sponge removal (day 0); CR (n=57), temporary calf removal for 120 h; CG (n=51), control group without treatment. Estrus rate differed among treatments (P&lt;0.01) being greater in PH (78.2%), followed by CR (52.0%) and CG (22.9%). A greater proportion of cows in the PH (80.0%) and CR (54%) groups had ovulations when compared to CG (35.4%). Intervals to first estrus were 13.5+/-6.3 days, 26.1+/-6.4 days and 52.5+/-7.5 days for the PH, CR and CG groups, respectively. First insemination conception was similar in the three groups. Postpartum intervals to first breeding (PFS) and to conception (PCI) were longer in CG than PH and CR groups (P&lt;0.05; P&lt;0.01). The PH and CR groups had a similar PFS but PCI was different (P&lt;0.02). Accumulated pregnancy rate at 30 and 60 but not at 90 days were different (30 days: P&lt;0.09; P&lt;0.01; P&lt;0.09; 60 days: P&lt;0.06; P&lt;0.01; P&lt;0.03) among treatments. After 90 days post-treatment, 9%, 18% and 33% of cows from the PH, CR and CG groups had not conceived. Similarly, 5.4%, 6.0% and 12.5% of cows from the PH, CR and CG groups, respectively, were culled from the herd because of lack of pregnancy after 180 days post treatment. In the group of cows evaluated by ultrasonography, only those cows having larger ovaries and dominant follicles had ovulations. It was concluded that the hormonal treatment was more efficient in inducing a fertile estrus and reducing calving to conception interval followed by the calf removal for 120 h. Each method can be considered as an important tool to reduce the postpartum anestrous period in dual purpose herds when AI is conduct in the tropics.",M1
17522074,"Effect of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 on steroidogenesis in granulosa cells derived from equine chorionic gonadotropin-primed immature rat ovaries.Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP) 7 is a secreted protein that regulates cellular proliferation, adhesion, and angiogenesis, and has low affinity for IGF compared with that of IGFBP1-IGFBP6. We sought to determine whether IGFBP7 is present in follicular fluid and to elucidate whether IGFBP7 participates in the steroidogenesis of rat mature follicles. Follicular fluid and granulosa cells (GCs) were collected from immature rats 2 days after their treatment with equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>). IGFBP7 protein was detected in the follicular fluid and the conditioned medium of cultured ovarian GCs by immunoblot analysis. When subconfluent GCs were cultured and treated with FSH and activin, coincubation with FSH and activin markedly increased GC expression of Cyp19a1 (aromatase) mRNA and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) secretion. The addition of recombinant murine IGFBP7 to these cultures decreased in the activin-enhanced, FSH-stimulated Cyp19a1 mRNA levels in the cells and suppressed the 17beta-E(2) levels in the culture medium. Treatment of GCs with Igfbp7-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), which knocked down Igfbp7 expression, increased the FSH-stimulated levels of Cyp19a1 but not Cyp11a1 expression. Basal and FSH-stimulated 17beta-E(2) secretion into the culture medium was also enhanced by Igfbp7 siRNA. These results suggest that IGFBP7 suppresses estrogen production in GCs. These observations support the notion that this protein, which is secreted into the follicular fluid, may serve as an intraovarian factor that negatively regulates GC differentiation.",M1
17468395,"Inhibition of cytochrome P-450 C17 enzyme by a GnRH agonist in ovarian follicles from gonadotropin-stimulated rats.Our objective was to study the direct action of a GnRH-I agonist, leuprolide acetate (LA), on ovarian steroidogenesis in preovulatory follicles obtained from equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>)-treated rats. Previously, we have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of LA on steroidogenesis and follicular development. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) exerts its negative effect on follicular development by inhibiting thecal cytochrome P-450 C17 (P450C17) alpha-hydroxylase expression and, consequently, androgen synthesis. Studies were carried out in prepubertal female rats injected with either eCG (control) or eCG plus LA (LA) and killed at different time points. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that LA induced steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) expression mainly in theca cells of preantral and antral follicles. In addition, serum progesterone levels increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), whereas those of androsterone decreased (P &lt; 0.05) after 8 h of LA treatment. This inhibition caused by LA seemed to be a consequence of the decreased expression of follicular P450C17 alpha-hydroxylase, as demonstrated by Western blot and RT-PCR techniques. In vitro studies using follicles isolated from 48-h-eCG-treated rats and cultured with LA showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) inhibition of FSH-induced androsterone follicular content as well as P450C17 alpha-hydroxylase protein levels, as determined by Western analysis. However, LA increased StAR protein expression in these follicles without significant changes in P450scc enzyme levels. Taking all these findings into account, we suggest that GnRH-I exerts a direct inhibitory action on gonadotropin-induced follicular development by decreasing the temporal expression of the P450C17 enzyme and, consequently, androgen production, thus reducing the supply of estrogens available to developing follicles.",M1
17112577,"Protocols for synchronizing estrus and ovulation in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis): a review.Poor estrus expression and a prolonged intercalving interval compromise the reproductive efficiency of female buffaloes. These limitations are exacerbated during the hot season, when fertility decreases dramatically. Pregnancy rate decrease further because difficulties in detecting estrus. To improve reproductive efficiency, several protocols of estrus and ovulation synchronization have been developed. These procedures are based on manipulating the CL, either to induce premature luteolysis using prostaglandins or to prolong the luteal phase using progestagens. However, it has recently emerged that a more precise manipulation of follicular development may be needed to achieve better synchrony of ovulation and improve fertility. Researchers have therefore turned their attention to evaluating programs in which hormones such as GnRH, FSH, LH, <e>eCG</e>, hCG, prostaglandins, progesterone and estradiol are administered. This review considers the impacts of estrus and ovulation synchronization protocols on fertility in the buffalo. In general, it may be stated that buffaloes respond well to the exogenous administration of hormones, and artificial insemination is possible at a pre-established time after synchronizing ovulation. Most combined hormone protocols give satisfactory pregnancy rates, comparable to those achieved in animals inseminated at natural estrus.",M1
17071778,"Inhibitory effect of leptin on the rat ovary during the ovulatory process.The aims of this study were to investigate the negative action of leptin on some intraovarian ovulatory mediators during the ovulatory process and to assess whether leptin is able to alter the expression of its ovarian receptors. Immature rats primed with gonadotrophins were used to induce ovulation. Serum leptin concentration was diminished 4 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration, whereas the ovarian expression of leptin receptors, measured by western blot, was increased by the gonadotrophin treatment. Serum progesterone level, ovulation rate and ovarian prostaglandin E (PGE) content were reduced in rats primed with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>)/hCG and treated with acute doses of leptin (five doses of 5 mug each). These inhibitory effects were confirmed by in vitro studies, where the presence of leptin reduced the concentrations of progesterone, PGE and nitrites in the media of both ovarian explants and preovulatory follicle cultures. We also investigated whether these negative effects were mediated by changes in the expression of the ovarian leptin receptors. Since leptin treatment did not alter the expression of ovarian leptin receptor, the inhibitory effect of leptin on the ovulatory process may not be mediated by changes in the expression of its receptors at ovarian level, at least at the concentrations assayed. In summary, the ovulatory process was significantly inhibited in response to an acute treatment with leptin, and this effect may be due, at least in part, to the direct or indirect impairment of some ovarian factors, such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide.",M1
17019562,"Internal dose-effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in gonadotropin-primed weanling rat model.Single sc injection of 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) induces ovulation in weanling female rats 3 days later. It has been shown that treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 24 h before eCG injection reduces eCG-stimulated ovarian hypertrophy and inhibits ovulation. The present study intended to compare internal dose-effects of TCDD between these endpoints and representative endpoints for TCDD toxicity, such as weights of the liver and thymus, in weanling female rats given orally 0, 1, 4 or 16 microg/kg TCDD 24 h before eCG injection on postnatal day 25. Measurement of plasma TCDD concentrations by ELISA at 6, 72 and 96 h after TCDD revealed that significant levels of TCDD were maintained in systemic circulation until 96 h (on the day of induced ovulation) with the highest level at 6 h after TCDD treatment. Ovarian TCDD concentrations varied similarly and tended to be higher than those in the thymus at all time points, whereas hepatic concentrations of TCDD were the highest among the tissues. Although &gt; or = 4 microg/kg TCDD affected the weights of the thymus and liver, no differences were observed in ovarian weights at any time point or in ovulation between corn oil-treated and TCDD-treated groups. Furthermore, ovarian levels of representative mRNAs in follicles were not affected by TCDD treatment. Since TCDD increased the amount of cytochrome P450 1A1 mRNA in the ovary, the administered TCDD stimulated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-signaling pathway. From these results, we concluded that thymus weights of weanling female rats responded to TCDD at a lower internal dose as compared with that ovarian hypertrophy and follicular growth from early antral stage to ovulation would respond to.",M1
16920187,"Effect of different number of frozen spermatozoa inseminated on the reproductive performance of rabbit does.The relationship between the number of frozen spermatozoa inseminated and fertility rate and litter size at birth in rabbit does was investigated.

All the does were synchronized with 20 UI of <e>eCG</e> 2 days before AI. The estimated sexual receptivity was 87%. The freezing-thawing procedure strongly reduced kinetic and functional traits (acrosome integrity, capacitation) of the spermatozoa. The number of spermatozoa inseminated did not affect the reproductive performance: the mean fertility rate and litter size values were 51.5% and 7.6%, respectively. Sexually receptive does (n=522) inseminated with frozen spermatozoa showed a 58.0% fertility rate whereas, non-receptive does (n=78), had a very poor fertility rate (7.8%).",M1
16870243,"Time of ovulation and reproductive performance over three parities after treatment of primiparous sows with PG600.Primiparous sows from a commercial pig farm in central Brazil were utilized to investigate the effect of post-weaning gonadotrophins (given during summer) on estrus, time of ovulation and reproductive performance over three parities. One group of sows (PG600) was treated with a combination of 400 IU equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>)+200 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (PG600) 24h after weaning (n=420), whereas the control group received saline (n=408). In a subset of sows (n=150), estrus was detected and time of ovulation was determined by transcutaneous ultrasound. Treatment with PG600 increased the percentage of primiparous sows in estrus within 10 days after weaning (94.8% versus 79.7%) and reduced the first weaning-to-estrus interval (5.3 days versus 8.0 days) relative to control sows (P&lt;0.05). Although the duration of estrus was longer (P&lt;0.05) in sows given PG600 (65.7 h versus 61.0 h), the interval from estrus to ovulation was not different (P&gt;0.05) between PG600 and control sows (46.6 h versus 43.3 h). Treatment with PG600 did not affect (P&gt;0.05) rates of return-to-estrus and farrowing over three parities, but it increased the number of total piglets born (P&lt;0.05) in the second parity (11.2 versus 10.4), thereby minimizing the magnitude of second-litter syndrome. Culling rates from the first to the fourth parity were 26.7 and 24.5% (P&gt;0.05) for PG600 and control sows, respectively. In conclusion, PG600 given 24 h after the first weaning reduced the weaning-to-estrus interval and increased the size of the second litter.",M1

The results were evaluated according to the number of fetuses born some days later and the presence of hyperketonaemia (BHB: &gt; or = 1.60 mmol/l). In May, about 3 months after lambing, cyclic ovarian function was induced (Cronolone + <e>eCG</e>), and the ewes were inseminated artificially (AI) 48 h after the removal of gestagen-containing sponge. At the time of AI and 10 days later blood samples were collected again to check the plasma levels of the same constituents as previously (in samples taken at AI), and to monitor the ovarian response by assaying progesterone (in both samples). On day 140 of gestation significantly lower BHB levels were detected in dams with single (n = 41) than in those with twin (n = 57) pregnancies. Hyperketonaemia was found only in ewes bearing twins (n = 27). These animals had higher NEFA and cortisol, and lower TCH, insulin, IGF-1, leptin and T3 levels than their normoketonaemic twin-bearing flock-mates, and those with single pregnancy. The blood glucose concentrations varied within a wide range, and the means of groups did not exhibit any significant differences. The formerly hyperketonaemic individuals were characterised by lower leptin level 3 months after lambing, and they showed a poorer response to the cycle-induction procedure than the others. The non-responders had lower IGF-1 and leptin levels than those ovulated after this treatment. It was concluded that the subclinical form of ovine ketosis is characterised by complex endocrine alterations, reflecting an obvious form of negative energy balance. If attempts to induce cyclic ovarian function outside the breeding season are made soon after lambing, the ovarian response and fertility of these ewes may also be depressed.",M1
16821564,"Short communication: effects of a gonadotropin application on seasonal subfertility in pigs.In this study the reproductive performance of weaned sows in a large production unit was evaluated during periods of high (&gt; 35 degrees C) summer temperatures. Only weaned sows of parity 2-6 (a total of n = 3386) were evaluated in two groups in 13 replicates: Group 1 (n = 1694): The sows were treated subcutaneously with 400 I.U. of Gonadotropinum sericum (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, PMSG [<e>eCG</e>]) and 200 I.U. of Gonadotropinum chorionicum (human choriongonadotropin, HCG [hCG]) on the day of weaning. Group 2: (n=1692). The sows received subcutaneously 4 ml of physiological NaCl solution on the day of weaning. Weaning to service intervals, regular and irregular returns to service, farrowing rates, and subsequent litter sizes were evaluated. Control sows had longer (P &lt; 0.01) weaning to service intervals and more (P &lt; 0.01) regular returns to service during hot weather periods compared with the gonadotropin treated sows. Irregular returns to service were low and showed no significant differences between the treated and non-treated sows (1.4+/-0.3 % vs. 1.5+/-0.4 %). Farrowing rates and litter sizes were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) better in the treated compared with the non-treated sows.",M1
16650467,"Lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase expression in the mouse ovary and its participation in cumulus-enclosed oocyte spontaneous meiotic maturation in vitro.The expression of lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (LDM) in the mouse ovary after gonadotrophin administration was examined and the action of follicle fluid meiosis activating sterol (FF-MAS), derived from lanosterol by the action of LDM, on oocyte spontaneous maturation was also evaluated in cumulus cell enclosed oocytes (CEOs). Expression of LDM was primarily in oocytes in primordial and secondary follicles prior to administration of gonadotrophins, but obvious LDM expression was apparent in ovarian somatic cells 48 h after administration of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>), especially in luteal and cumulus cells 54 h after eCG or 48 h after eCG plus 6 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The LDM expression in oocytes was only slightly elevated in larger growing follicles after eCG treatment. On the contrary, 48 h after hCG treatment, the elevated expression of LDM was only detected in interstitial cells. Therefore, eCG may be the primary gonadotrophin for LDM expression, and furthermore for production of FF-MAS in mouse cumulus cells (which are indispensable for oocyte maturation in vivo). Conversely, inhibitors of LDM, either 40 microM azalanstat or 50 microM RS-21745, significantly inhibited oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown (GVB) after 4h of in vitro culture; GVB rates decreased to 14 or 20%, compared to 90% in spontaneous maturation, respectively. There was no significant increase in GVB in CEOs following specific inhibitor of sterol Delta14-reductase and Delta7-reductase, AY9944-A-7 (5-100 microM), until marked oocytes degeneration appeared (50 microM). The phenomena may be ascribed to slow, passive accumulation of FF-MAS by AY9944-A-7, which cannot be associated with fast spontaneous progression. Furthermore, in spontaneous-matured CEOs, LDM was expressed preferentially in cumulus cells instead of oocytes. Therefore, FF-MAS may have a positive role in the spontaneous maturation of CEOs. In conclusion, there was an eCG-dependent dual LDM expression pattern on both oocytes and somatic cells in growing follicles in vivo, which may increase LDM expression and FF-MAS production in cumulus cells for oocyte maturation. For the first time, the inhibitory effect of LDM inhibitors on spontaneous maturation, together with the strong LDM expression in spontaneous matured CEOs, indicated that FF-MAS produced by cumulus cells might participate in spontaneous maturation of mouse CEOs.",M1
16597488,"In vitro maturation of pig oocytes with different media, hormone and meiosis inhibitors.This study evaluated in vitro maturation of pig oocytes in two maturation media (TCM199 and NCSU23) supplemented with 10% porcine follicular fluid (pFF) or 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and four hormonal treatments. The best media was then used to evaluate the effect of reversible meiosis inhibitors cycloheximide (5 microgram/ml) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]and butyrolactone I (12.5M) on the maturation of pig oocytes was evaluated. After maturation for 44 h, the oocytes were fixed, stained, and examined under epifluorescence microscopy. The comparison of the proportion of oocytes in metaphase II revealed that hormonal treatment 2(incubation for 22 h - 10 ng EGF/ml, 10 IU hCG/ml and 10 IU <e>eCG</e>/ml, followed by incubation for 22 h - 10 ng EGF/ml) presented higher repeatability percentages: TCM+ PVA (54.5% - 61/112); TCM+ pFF (65.0% - 63/97);NCSU23 + PVA (54.6% - 65/119), and NCSU23 + pFF (58.1% - 61/105). The comparison of maturation media showed that TCM199 presented more constant results than NCSU23. Regarding supplementation with pFF or PVA, TCM199 with pFF presented better results. The comparison between butyrolactone I and cycloheximide demonstrated that both drugs effectively inhibited meiosis; however, only cycloheximide presented metaphase II percentages similar to the control (70.29% and 75.49%, respectively). In conclusion, it is recommended the use of TCM199 medium supplemented with pFF and hormonal treatment with 10 ng EGF/ml, 10 UI hCG/mland 10 UI eCG/ml during the first 22 h and more 22 h with 10 ng EGF/ml for the pig oocytes maturation. Butyrolactone I and cycloheximide effectively arrested/resumpted maturation; however, the oocytes percentages in metaphase II was the same for both cycloheximide and the control groups.",M1
16530992,"Effect of ovarian superstimulation on COC collection and maturation in alpacas.The objective of the present study was to compare the ovarian follicular response, cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) collection rate, and maturational status of COC collected from alpacas subsequent to treatment with two different superstimulatory protocols. Alpacas (n=7 per group) were treated with: (1) 200mg of FSH im divided bid for 3d, plus a single i.v. dose of 1000IU hCG 24h after the last FSH treatment, or (2) 1200IU of <e>eCG</e> as a single i.m. dose, plus a single i.v. dose of 1000IU of hCG on day 3 after eCG treatment (day 0=start of superstimulatory treatment). At 20-24h post-hCG treatment, the ovaries were surgically exposed and COC were collected by needle aspiration of all follicles &gt; or =6mm. The FSH and eCG treatment groups did not differ with respect to the number of follicles &gt; or =6mm at the time of COC collection (20.0+/-7.5 versus 27.0+/-3.3; P=0.5), the number of COC collected (26.2+/-8.4 versus 23.3+/-3.7; P=0.7), or the collection rate per follicle aspirated (89% versus 87%; P=0.7). No differences were detected between FSH- and eCG-treated alpacas in the number of expanded COC collected per alpaca (11.5+/-2.9 versus 8.8+/-2.8; P=0.54), the number of expanded COC in metaphase II (8.5+/-1.9 versus 6.0+/-2.1; P=0.1), or the number of compact COC with &gt; or =3 layers of cumulus cells (12.5+/-4.3 versus 14.3+/-2.6; P=0.72). A greater proportion (P&lt;0.05) of compact COC collected after FSH treatment matured in vitro to the metaphase II stage than after eCG treatment. Eight expanded alpaca COC were fertilized in vitro with llama sperm, three of which were fixed and stained 18h after exposure to sperm and five were cultured in vitro. Two of the three stained oocytes were in the pronuclear stage, and all five of the cultured oocytes developed to the two-cell and morula stages at 2 and 7 days, respectively, after in vitro fertilization. In summary, FSH and eCG treatments were equally effective for ovarian superstimulation and oocyte collection. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected from more than 80% of follicles aspirated during laparotomy. Nearly one third of the COC collected after superstimulation were in metaphase II, and more than 70% of the remaining COC progressed to metaphase II after in vitro maturation for 26h, bringing the mean number of oocytes available for in vitro fertilization to 16 per alpaca. Preliminary results support the hypothesis that alpaca oocytes obtained after superstimulation in the absence of progesterone are developmentally competent since morulae developed from all five COC fertilized and cultured in vitro.",M1
16513161,"GnRH agonist Lupron (leuprolide acetate) pre-treatments prevent ovulation in response to gonadotropin stimulation in the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa).In many species, controlling the ovary prior to induction of ovulation improves the success of ovarian response and artificial insemination (AI). We assessed the impact of suppression of estrus with the GnRH agonist, Lupron, on ovarian sensitivity to equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the clouded leopard. Seven female clouded leopards were given two injections of Lupron (3.75 mg IM) 23 d apart, followed 44 d later by eCG and hCG. Daily fecal samples were collected from 60 d before Lupron to 60 d after hCG. Fecal metabolites of estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Lupron decreased (P &lt; 0.05) the number of E peaks during Lupron treatment compared to pre-Lupron. All females had baseline E and six of seven (86%) had nadir P on day of eCG. Exogenous gonadotropins induced E elevations in all females. However, mean E in the gonadotropin-provoked estrus was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared to pre-Lupron estrous periods. Only one of seven (14%) females ovulated after eCG/hCG. In conclusion, estrous cycle control with Lupron resulted in predictable ovarian suppression prior to gonadotropin stimulation but altered ovarian sensitivity by an as yet unknown mechanism so that ovulation was inhibited, even when using a proven exogenous gonadotropin protocol.",M1
16508211,"Variation with age in the numbers of ovulated ova and follicles of Wistar-Imamichi adult rats superovulated with <e>eCG</e>-hCG.There are large variations with age in the number of ovulated ova found in superovulated female Wistar-Imamichi rats. In this study we investigated the numbers of ovulated ova and follicles with the aim of developing a superovulation technique that minimises variations. We also examined the number of non-atretic follicles in untreated rats aged 7-14 weeks, for each week of age. The numbers of 250-549 microm non-atretic follicles in untreated rats and the numbers of ovulated ova in superovulated rats both reached a peak at 12 weeks of age. The coefficients of variation for both follicle numbers and ova numbers changed with each week of age, reaching a maximum at 9 weeks of age and a minimum at 12 weeks of age. In order to achieve stable numbers of ova from superovulated rats, satisfactory results will be achieved using 12-week-old rats, minimising individual variations, with high numbers of ova.",M1
16466868,"Effect of altering dose of PG600 on reproductive performance responses in prepubertal gilts and weaned sows.This study evaluated the effects of altering dose of PG600 on estrus and ovulation responses in prepubertal gilts and weaned sows. Experiment 1 tested the effects of one (1.0x, 400IU <e>eCG</e>+200IU hCG, n=74), one and a half (1.5x, n=82), or two (2.0x, n=71) doses of PG600 for prepubertal gilts. Estrus (58%) and ovulation (90%) were not affected (P&gt;0.10) by dose. Higher doses increased (P&lt;0.01) numbers of corpora lutea (17, 24, and 25), but not (P&gt;0.10) the proportion of gilts with cysts (26, 36, and 46% for 1.0x, 1.5x, and 2.0x, respectively). Experiment 2 tested the effects of 0x (n=30), 0.5x (n=32), 1.0x (n=29), or 1.5x (n=30) doses of PG600 in weaned sows. Dose did not influence return to estrus (90%, P&gt;0.10). There was an effect of dose (P&lt;0.05) on incidence of cysts (3.4, 1.8, 6.4, and 29.8%, for 0x, 0.5x, 1.0x, and 1.5x doses, respectively). The 0.5x dose increased (P&lt;0.01) farrowing rate (83.2%) compared to 0x (72.1%) and 1.5x (58.6%), but was not different from 1.0x (76.4%). Total pigs born (10.5+/-0.8) did not differ (P&gt;0.10) among treatments. These data suggest that increasing dose of PG600 to 1.5x for gilts increases the number of corpora lutea but does not alter the proportion expressing estrus or ovulating. Reducing dose of PG600 for weaned sows did not alter estrus or ovulation, but the 0.5x dose increased farrowing rate compared to no PG600.",M1
16452721,"Effects of gonadotrophin treatments on meiotic and developmental competence of oocytes in porcine primordial follicles following xenografting to nude mice.Our objective was to improve the developmental ability of oocytes in porcine primordial follicles xenografted to nude mice, by treating the host mice with gonadotrophins to accelerate follicular growth. Ovarian tissues from 20-day-old piglets, in which most of the follicles were primordial, were transplanted under the kidney capsules of ovariectomized nude mice. Gonadotrophin treatments were commenced around 60 days after vaginal cornification in the mice. Ovarian grafts were obtained 2 or 3 days after treatment with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>-2 and eCG-3 groups), after porcine FSH infusion for 7 or 14 days, or after infusion of porcine FSH for 14 days with a single injection of estradiol antiserum (FSH-7, FSH-14 and FSH-14EA groups, respectively). Gonadotrophin treatments accelerated follicular growth within the xenografts compared with that in control mice given no gonadotrophins, consistent with higher (P &lt; 0.05) circulating inhibin levels in the gonadotrophin-treated mice. In contrast, circulating mouse FSH levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) depressed. We recovered large numbers of full-sized oocytes with meiotic competence to the mature stage from the eCG-3, FSH-7, and FSH-14EA, unlike in the control group. Moreover, 56% of matured oocytes with the first polar body (n = 39) were fertilized in vitro in the FSH-14EA group. After in vitro fertilization and subsequent culture for 7 days, one blastocyst was obtained from each of the eCG-3, FSH-7 and, FSH-14EA groups, whereas no blastocysts appeared in the other groups. Exogenous gonadotrophins--not mouse FSH--stimulated the growing follicles that had developed from the primordial follicles in the xenografts: the effects were incomplete but improved to some extent the meiotic and developmental abilities of the oocytes.",M1
16149948,"Different doses of porcine luteinizing hormone in precocious puberty induction in gilts.The use of hormonal protocols in puberty induction and synchronization of oestrus has lead to an increase in the efficiency of replacement gilts. The aim of this study was to evaluate different doses of porcine LH in precocious puberty induction and oestrus synchronization in a homogeneous group of gilts. Sixty-seven homogeneous prepubertal gilts (Camborough 22) at 137 +/- 4 days of age and 87 +/- 7 kg were treated with three different hormonal protocols: T1--600 UI of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>; Novormon) and after a 72-h period 5 mg of LH (Lutropin); T2--600 UI of eCG and a 72-h period 2.5 mg of LH; T3--600 UI of eCG and a 72-h period 1.25 mg of LH. The ovaries were examined at slaughter, on day 6 after the hormonal treatment. There were no statistical differences (p &gt; 0.05) between the different LH doses in the percentage of the detected oestrus (T1 = 42.85%; T2 = 60.87%, T3 = 52.18%), oestrus duration (T1 = 41.44 +/- 16.30 h; T2 = 48.57 +/- 16.29 h, T3 = 39.33 +/- 11.42 h), number of corpora lutea (T1 = 9.61 +/- 5.43; T2 = 9.86 +/- 3.32, T3 = 8.13 +/- 5.52) and percentage of animals presenting ovarian cystic degeneration (T1 = 33.33%; T2 = 39.13%, T3 = 39.13%). The T2 (2.5 mg of LH) presented the lowest dispersion (p &lt; 0.05) of the LH-ovulation interval (T1 = 37.17 +/- 4.07 h; T2 = 38.26 +/- 2.84 h; T3 = 36.25 +/- 5.69 h). The LH dose reduction to 2.50 and 1.25 mg presented equal results with the recommended dose of 5.0 mg, and could be used in the precocious induction of oestrus in gilts. The 2.5-mg LH dose showed the lowest dispersion of ovulation and it can be used in fixed-time artificial insemination programmes.",M1
16055281,"A new approach to enhance reproductive performance in sheep using royal jelly in comparison with equine chorionic gonadotropin.The objective was to compare the effects of royal jelly (RJ) and <e>eCG</e> treatments on reproductive performance of ewes synchronized using intravaginal progesterone-releasing devices. Forty-two cycling Awassi ewes were treated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 15 mg PGF2alpha. On the following day, all ewes were administered with CIDR-G for 12 days and were randomly allocated to three (RJ, eCG and control) groups of 14 ewes each. Ewes in the RJ-treated group received daily i.m. treatments of 400mg RJ during the period of CIDR-treatment. Each ewe in the eCG-treated group received an i.m. treatment of 500 IU eCG at the time of CIDR-G removal (day 0) and no further treatment was given to ewes in the control group. Ewes were exposed to four fertile rams for 72 h, from the time of CIDR-G removal, and checked for breeding marks at 6-h intervals. Blood samples were collected from day -13 until day 0 and thereafter until day 19 for progesterone analysis. Royal jelly treatment resulted in a greater rate of decline and lower (P&lt;0.02) progesterone concentrations between days -10 and 0 than eCG-treated and control ewes. Expression of estrus was similar among the three groups and intervals to onset of estrus were shorter (P&lt;0.01) in RJ-treated (31.3h) and eCG-treated (29.8h) than control (41.3h) ewes. First-cycle pregnancy and lambing rates were greater (P&lt;0.05) in RJ-treated (71.4 and 71.4%) and eCG-treated (85.7 and 78.6%) than in control (42.9 and 35.7%) ewes, respectively. Results demonstrate that the treatments of RJ and eCG in conjunction with CIDR-G were similarly effective in induction of estrus and improvement of pregnancy and lambing rates.",M1

15821780,"Growth factors effects on preimplantation development of mouse embryos exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha.The success rates of assisted reproduction techniques are still unsatisfactory. Relatively few in vitro cultured embryos reach the blastocyst stage. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the protective potential of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-I, IGF-II) and stem cell factor (SCF) on in vitro development of pre-implantation mouse embryos exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). C3B6F1 female mice were superovulated with 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 48 h later with 5IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>). Following the second injection females were mated with DBA males. Two cell embryos were flushed out from the fallopian tubes 40 h after eCG administration. After retrieval, the embryos were divided into control and experimental media and incubated in groups of ten for 96 h (37 degrees C, 5%CO(2), in droplets of 50 microl under mineral oil). In the first part of experiment, the embryo development was tested in media containing EGF, IGF-I, IGF-II, SCF, TNF-alpha (1 to 1000 ng/ml). In the second part of the study, the development of embryos was examined in medium containing 100 ng/ml TNFalpha and one of following factors: IGF-I, IGF-II; EGF or SCF (100 ng/ml). During the culture embryos were examined at 24 hours intervals to assess the embryo development. Blastocyst rate was determined following 96 hours of culture. Evaluation of total blastocyst cell number (TB) and inner cell mass (ICM) was also performed. TNFalpha significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) the blastocyst rates as well as TB and ICM. The examined growth factors improved the development of embryos exposed to TNFalpha. Thus, in this study, the protective action of IGF-I and II, EGF and SCF against the detrimental influence of TNFalpha was demonstrated.",M1
15819964,"Second oestrus synchronization and precocious embryo viability after puberty induction in gilts by the use of gonadotrophin treatment.The use of exogenous gonadotrophins in puberty inducement and ovulation synchronization is a technique that has a positive influence on the management of swine. The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of a second gonadotrophin treatment [equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) and luteinizing hormone (LH), intramuscularly (i.m.)] upon the second oestrus synchronization and fertility in gilts. Seventy-one NAIMA (Pen Ar Lan) gilts had their first oestrus (puberty inducement) induced by a hormonal treatment (eCG and LH). Then, they were randomly distributed into two treatments, with (T1) and without (C) gonadotrophin treatment at the second oestrus. The animals were fed with a single ration (16% of crude protein and 3286.73 kcal ME/kg), and timed artificial insemination performed at the second oestrus. Gilts were slaughtered for embryo recovery and ovary examination about 5 days after insemination. There was no evidence of a difference in the percentage of the second oestrus expression (T1 - 90.90% and C - 86.84%), the duration of the oestrus cycle (T1 - 19.62 +/- 0.82 days and C - 19.67 +/- 4.14 days), the percentage of follicular cysts (T1 - 15.15% and C - 18.42%) and number of ovulations (T1 - 14.60 +/- 5.7 and C - 13.23 +/- 4.8) between treatments (p &gt; 0.05). However, the hormonal treatment (T1) showed minor oestrus dispersion and embryo viability (T1 - 8.4 +/- 5.6 and C - 11.2 +/- 4.6) (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that the better synchronization and expression of the second oestrus when using gonadotrophins (eCG and LH) is followed by a lower embryo viability, which is probably the consequence of the heterogeneous follicle recruitment during the injection of eCG.",M1
15814822,"Mammalian-like nonsialyl complex-type N-glycosylation of equine gonadotropins in Mimic insect cells.Recombinant equine luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (eLH/CG) was expressed in Mimic insect cells, that are commercial stably transformed Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing five mammalian genes encoding glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of complex-type monosialylated N-glycans. We previously showed that it exhibited no in vivo bioactivity although expressing full in vitro bioactivity, and it was suspected that this was because of insufficient sialylation of eLH/CG N-glycans. Lectin binding analyses were performed with recombinant dimeric eLH/CG or its alpha subunit, secreted in the serum-containing supernatant of infected Sf9 and Mimic cells. Two types of specific lectin affinity assays (blot analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were used to compare the ability or inability of natural and recombinant gonadotropins to bind to various lectins. In natural equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>), complex-type N-glycans terminating with both Siaalpha2,3Gal (based on Maackia amurensis agglutinin [MAA] binding) and Siaalpha2,6Gal (based on Sambucus nigra agglutinin [SNA] binding) were found, but in the alpha subunit dissociated from natural eCG, we only detected Siaalpha2-6Gal. In eLH/CG and its alpha subunit produced by Sf9 cells, N-glycans were found to be terminated by mannosyl residues (based on Galanthus nivalis agglutinin [GNA] binding), whereas those produced in Mimic cells were terminated by galactoses (based on binding to Ricinus communis agglutinin I [RCA I] , but not to SNA or MAA). This is in agreement with the fact that the nucleotide donor substrate of sialic acid is not naturally synthesized in insect cells. On the basis of binding to Arachis Hypogaea agglutinin [PNA], O-glycans exhibited the Galbeta1-3GalNAc structure in recombinant-free alpha and eLH/CG from both Sf9 and Mimic cell lines. Both N- and O-linked carbohydrate side chains synthesized in Mimic cells should thus be amenable to further acellular sialylation.",M1
15750302,"Ovarian activity and oocyte development during follicular development in pigs at different reproductive phases estimated by the repeated endoscopic method.The aim of the present study was to assess follicular and oocyte development in the same gilts during three phases of their reproductive life [prepuberal gilts (PP; 6.0 months of age), puberal gilts (P; 9.5 months of age) and primiparous sows (S)]. Follicular development was stimulated by the injection of 1,000 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) followed by 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 72 h later. Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were recovered by endoscopic ovum pick up/aspiration from preovulatory follicles of the left ovary, and the follicular fluid (FF) from the right ovary was collected 34 h after the hCG treatment by endoscopy. Altogether, 19 pigs were used in the PP and P trials and 12 in the S trial. From the left ovaries, 168, 190 and 82 follicles were aspirated and 106, 125 and 42 COCs, respectively, were recovered (recovery rate 61 +/- 27, 63 +/- 21 and 53 +/- 22%, respectively). The mean number of follicles was greater in the P phase than in the PP phase (19.7 +/- 6.8 vs. 15.7 +/- 6.8; p=0.06) and S phases (14.2 +/- 4.0; p&lt;0.05). More uniform oocytes with an expanded cumulus were aspirated in the P and PP phases than in the S phase (90 and 78 vs. 46%; p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the meiotic configuration in oocytes (T I/M II stage) differed between the three phases (56 and 62 vs. 0%; p&lt;0.05). Progesterone (P4) levels in FF decreased from 590.0 +/- 333.6 (PP) to 249.1 +/- 72.6 (P) and 161.4 +/- 75.2 ng/ml (S) (p&lt;0.05). Estradiol-17beta (E2) levels differed between PP and P gilts and S sows (9.3 +/- 2.9, 21.9 +/- 10.6 and 94.0 +/- 15.9 pg/ml, respectively; p&lt;0.05), and the P4/E2 ratio was 72, 15 and 5, respectively. These results indicate differences in follicular and oocyte development between the reproductive phases investigated. Puberal gilts should preferably be used in IVF and breeding programs. The lower reproductive potential of primiparous sows must be taken into consideration in breeding. Any prediction of lifetime performance based on individual ovarian reactions of prepuberal gilts is unreliable.",M1

First, to evaluate the effect of exogenous progesterone on ovarian follicular dynamics in order to assess its ability to synchronize ovarian activity in the vicuna. Secondly, to evaluate the ovarian response to the treatment with eCG through the observation of the structures developed in the ovaries. Follicular dynamics was monitored daily by transrectal ultrasonography in 12 adult, non-pregnant vicunas. Plasma progesterone and estradiol-17beta concentrations were measured in blood samples collected daily. In experiment 1, intravaginal devices containing 0.33g of progesterone were inserted into the vagina and kept in place for 5 days (treatment group, n = 8). After progesterone withdrawal, five animals were further monitored in order to evaluate the efficacy of the CIDR to synchronize the emergence of a dominant follicle. In experiment 2, four females received 750IU of eCG IM. Two were previously monitored ultrasonographically to confirm the absence of a dominant follicle at the beginning of the superstimulatory treatment (group A). The other two animals had a CIDR inserted into the vagina for 5 days and the superstimulatory treatment was applied 24h after device withdrawal (group B). Females from both groups were surgically explored 96 h after eCG injection; the ovaries were exposed and the number of newly formed structures produced by each ovary was counted. Peak progesterone concentrations (25.9 +/- 5.29 nmol l(-1), mean +/- S.E.M.) were attained on day 1 after device insertion, remained high until the day of device withdrawal (9.7 +/- 1.98 nmol l(-1)) and decreased to 5.5 +/- 1.13 nmol l(-1) the day after. There was no follicle development to the state of dominance after device insertion. Moreover, mean follicle diameter steadily decreased after insertion of the device until the minimum mean value (1.85 +/- 0.17 mm) was recorded on day 5 (P = 0.006). Similarly, plasma concentrations of estradiol-17beta remained below 35 pmol l(-1) during the period of progesterone treatment in all animals and the mean estradiol-17beta declined with the lowest value (22.1 +/- 2.19 pmol l(-1)) being recorded on day 4 after device insertion. After superstimulation of follicular development with eCG, the total number of follicles that developed was 33 in group A and 58 in group B and the mean number of newly developed ovarian structures per female was 22.75 +/- 4.26. In conclusion, progesterone released by the CIDR exerts a negative effect on ovarian follicular development and function suggesting intravaginal devices could be used to synchronize the beginning of follicular waves during a superstimulatory treatment. There was also a tendency for greater ovarian follicular development when the animals were previously treated with progesterone.",M1
15629803,"The effects of ram exposure during progestagen oestrus synchronisation and time of ram introduction post progestagen withdrawal on fertility in ewes.Three experiments were undertaken to investigate the effect of a pre-mating ram exposure during progestagen synchronisation treatment on time of breeding, ovulation rate, embryo quality and fertility and any interaction with time of ram introduction for breeding post sponge withdrawal. Crossbred ewes in experiment 1a (n = 348), 1b (mule; n = 133) and 2 (n = 58) underwent a 12-14 days synchronisation protocol. Three days prior to sponge withdrawal ewes were divided into Control (ewes in continued isolation from rams) or +Ram (ram-exposed) groups. Rams were introduced to +Ram ewes and remained with ewes until sponge withdrawal. Ewes in experiments 1a and 2 received <e>eCG</e> at sponge withdrawal and were reintroduced to rams at either 36 or 48 h post sponge removal (PSR). In experiment 1b, ewes did not receive eCG and were reintroduced to rams at 24 h PSR. In experiments 1a and 1b time of breeding, date of lambing and litter size were recorded. In experiment 2, ewes were slaughtered 5 days post breeding, reproductive tracts flushed and corpora lutea, ova and embryos assessed. Fewer +Ram ewes were mated by 96 h PSR (P &lt; 0.001) than Control ewes in experiment 1a but not when rams were introduced earlier in experiment 1b. In experiment 1a, ram introduction at 36 h PSR improved conception to first service compared to introduction at 48 h PSR (P &lt; 0.01) in both +Ram and Control groups. In experiments 1a and 1b, +Ram ewes had reduced litter size caused by more single births (1a; P &lt; 0.001, 1b; P &lt; 0.01). In experiment 2, +Ram ewes had fewer corpora lutea than Control ewes (P &lt; 0.001) but embryo quality was similar. However, more good embryos were produced when rams were introduced for breeding at 36 h compared to 48 h PSR (P &lt; 0.001). We conclude that a pre-mating ram exposure during the synchronisation treatment reduced the number of ewes mated at and conceiving to the first service. This was partially overcome by introducing rams for breeding earlier (24 or 36 h compared to 48 h PSR) but the most dramatic decrease in fertility was due to a reduction in ovulation rate in the ram-exposed ewes.",M1
15511545,"Comparison of four synchronization protocols for fixed-time bovine embryo transfer in Bos indicus x Bos taurus recipients.The objective was to evaluate the effects of 400 IU of <e>eCG</e> given on Days 5 or 8 of an estrus synchronization protocol with progesterone-releasing intravaginal devices (PRID) and estradiol benzoate (EB), in recipients for fixed-time embryo transfer. A secondary objective was to determine the effects of injectable progesterone (given concurrent with EB treatment). Three-hundred-and-four crossbred Bos taurus x Bos indicus beef heifers were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (2 x 2 factorial design). At unknown stages of the estrous cycle (Day 0), all heifers received a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID), plus 2mg of EB i.m., with or without a concurrent treatment of 50mg of progesterone i.m. Heifers were further subdivided to receive 0.15 mg of d-cloprostenol (PGF) i.m. and 400 IU of eCG i.m. on Days 5 or 8. In all heifers, intravaginal devices were removed on Day 8 and 1mg of EB was given i.m. on Day 9 (Day 10 was arbitrarily considered the day of estrus). On Day 17, all heifers with &gt;1 CL or a single CL with a diameter &gt; or =18 mm (based on ultrasonographic examination), received an in vitro produced (IVP) embryo by non-surgical transfer. On Day 17, there was an effect of day of eCG administration on the number of CL (1.35 +/- 0.08 versus 1.13 +/- 0.04, for Day 5 versus Day 8, respectively; P = 0.02) and (in a subset of 154 heifers) mean (+/-S.E.M.) plasma progesterone concentrations (2.41 +/- 0.26 versus 1.74 +/- 0.19 ng/mL; P = 0.03). Although the proportion of recipients transferred/treated and pregnant/transferred did not differ among groups, the proportion of recipients pregnant/treated tended (P = 0.1) to be higher in heifers treated with eCG on Day 5 versus Day 8 (47.0% versus 40.7%, respectively). Progesterone treatment had no significant effect. In conclusion, treatment with eCG (and D-cloprostenol) on Day 5 significantly increased the number of CL and plasma progesterone concentrations and tended to increase pregnancy rates, although progesterone treatment had no significant effect.",M1
15367268,"In vivo embryo recovery rate by laparoscopic technique from rabbit does selected for growth rate.Rabbit does from R line selected for growth rate present a low reproductive performance and this study aimed to evaluate both the recovery efficacy and viability of recovered embryos after vitrification and the reproductive performance of donor does subjected to in vivo recovery. Does were divided into three groups: 28 does without in vivo recovery (control), 25 does in which in vivo recovery was started in the nulliparous state (group 1) and 30 does with at least one litter before in vivo recovery (group 2). Does were superovulated with a single subcutaneous injection of 50 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) per female, and were then artificially inseminated 60 h later and immediately administered an intravenous dose of 75 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) per female. Does from group 1 and 2 were recovered in vivo 76-80 h post-insemination by repeated laparoscopies at one to four times and permitted one or two parturitions between recoveries [in vivo (IV) recovery]. At the end of the experiment, about 16 does of all groups were recovered post-mortem (PM recovery). All normal embryos were vitrified, devitrified and then cultivated in vitro to evaluate the viability after thawing. A significant increase in the ovulation rate was found in does recovered PM than in those recovered IV in the nulliparous state. However, no significant differences were observed in the recovery rate, the donor rate, the number of normal embryos recovered with at least one normal embryo per doe and the viability after thawing between the PM and IV groups. A significant decrease in the fertility rate, total born, live born and weaned kids was found for does from group 1 in comparison with does from group 2. Results support the use of repeated laparoscopy to increase the number of recovered embryos per donor doe especially in such R line does, if they are permitted to produce at least one litter before the beginning of in vivo recovery.",M1
15345060,"Immature rats show ovulatory defects similar to those in adult rats lacking prostaglandin and progesterone actions.Gonadotropin-primed immature rats (GPIR) constitute a widely used model for the study of ovulation. Although the equivalence between the ovulatory process in immature and adult rats is generally assumed, the morphological and functional characteristics of ovulation in immature rats have been scarcely considered. We describe herein the morphological aspects of the ovulatory process in GPIR and their response to classical ovulation inhibitors, such as the inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis indomethacin (INDO) and a progesterone (P) receptor (PR) antagonist (RU486). Immature Wistar rats were primed with equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) at 21, 23 or 25 days of age, injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 48 h later, and sacrificed 16 h after hCG treatment, to assess follicle rupture and ovulation. Surprisingly, GPIR showed age-related ovulatory defects close similar to those in adult rats lacking P and PG actions. Rats primed with eCG at 21 or 23 days of age showed abnormally ruptured corpora lutea in which the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) was trapped or had been released to the ovarian interstitum, invading the ovarian stroma and blood and lymphatic vessels. Supplementation of immature rats with exogenous P and/or PG of the E series did not significantly inhibit abnormal follicle rupture. Otherwise, ovulatory defects were practically absent in rats primed with eCG at 25 days of age. GPIR treated with INDO showed the same ovulatory alterations than vehicle-treated ones, although affecting to a higher proportion of follicles. Blocking P actions with RU486 increased the number of COC trapped inside corpora lutea and decreased ovulation. The presence of ovulatory defects in GPIR, suggests that the capacity of the immature ovary to undergo the coordinate changes leading to effective ovulation is not fully established in Wistar rats primed with eCG before 25 days of age.",M1
15095333,"Basigin expression and regulation in mouse ovary during the sexual maturation and development of corpus luteum.Basigin is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Basigin-deficient male mice are azoospermic. The majority of basigin null embryos die around the time of implantation. However, basigin expression and regulation in mouse ovary is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate basigin expression in mouse ovary during sexual maturation, gonadotropin treatment, and luteal development by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Both basigin mRNA and immunostaining were not detected in the granulosa cells of preantral follicles until day 20 after birth. On day 30 after birth, basigin immunostaining dropped to a basal level, while basigin mRNA was still at a high level. Basigin expression was strongly induced by equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) treatment at 4 and 8 hr post-eCG injection. Both basigin immunostaining and mRNA signals were strongly observed in the corpus luteum on days 2 and 3 post-hCG injection. However, no basigin expression was detected from days 6 to 15 post-hCG injection. In conclusion, our data suggest that basigin may play a role during the mouse follicle development and corpus luteum formation.",M1
15036962,"Do high progesterone concentrations decrease pregnancy rates in embryo recipients synchronized with PGF2alpha and <e>eCG</e>?The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) treatment on the number of induced accessory corpora lutea (CL), plasma progesterone concentrations and pregnancy rate in cross-bred heifers after transfer of frozen-thawed (1.5M ethylene glycol) embryos. All recipients received 500 microg PGF2alpha (dl-cloprostenol, i.m.) at random stages of the estrous cycle (Day 0) and were observed for estrus for 7 days. On Day 14, heifers detected in estrus between 2 and 7 days after PGF2alpha treatment were randomly allocated to four groups ( n=83 per group) and given 0 (control), 200, 400, or 600 IU of eCG. Two days later (Day 16), these recipients were given PGF2alpha and observed for estrus. Six to eight days after detection of estrus, plasma samples were collected to determine progesterone concentration and ultrasonography was performed to observe ovarian structures. Heifers with multiple CL or a single CL &gt;15 mm in diameter received an embryo by direct transfer. Embryos of excellent and good quality were thawed and transferred to the recipients by the same veterinarian. Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasonography and confirmed by transrectal palpation 21 and 83 days after embryo transfer (ET), respectively. Plasma progesterone concentrations on the day of transfer (Day 7 of the estrous cycle) were 3.9+/-0.7, 4.2+/-0.4,6.0+/-0.4 and 7.8+/-0.6 ng/ml for groups Control, 200, 400, and 600, respectively (Control versus treated groups P=0.009; 200 versus 400 and 600 groups P=0.0001; and 400 versus 600 P=0.012 ). Conception rates 83 days after ET were 41.9, 50.0, 25.0, and 20.9% for groups Control, 200, 400, and 600, respectively (200 versus 400 and 600 groups P=0.0036 ). In conclusion, an increase in progesterone concentration, induced by eCG treatment, did not improve pregnancy rates in ET recipients. Conversely, there was a decline in conception rates in the animals with the highest plasma progesterone concentrations.",M1
15016958,"Minor involvement of somatic growth in the onset of puberty of Hatano high- and low-avoidance rats.The present study was planned to examine the effects of somatic growth on the determination of timing of puberty using Hatano high- and low-avoidance rats (HAAs and LAAs); the rats were genetically selected from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats for good or poor performance in a two-way active avoidance-learning test. Since these two lines were found to have different characteristics, such as body weight at birth, maternal care and timing of male puberty, the present study characterized female puberty in Hatano rats and then compared postnatal growth and timing of puberty between the two lines of rats when they were nursed by foster SD dams. When nursed under biological dams, HAAs became heavier, exhibited vaginal opening at a younger age and first ovulation was accompanied by more oocytes than LAAs. In all of the HAAs, but none of the LAAs, ovulation was induced by a single s.c. injection of 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) on day 22 after birth. An additional treatment with 10 IU human CG revealed that, in the ovaries of LAAs, a small number of follicles had developed to an ovulable stage as a result of the treatment. The fostering improved somatic growth, and weights of LAAs were sustained at a heavier level than those of fostered HAAs. The fostering, however, did not eliminate the line difference in the timing of puberty of both sexes; it did accelerate the vaginal opening of LAAs but not the balanopreputial separation. Thus, there is a phenotypic difference in the timing of female puberty in Hatano rats exhibiting a different timing of ovarian development in response to gonadotropin. The present study indicates that postnatal somatic growth is not the predominant determinant in the onset of puberty in Hatano rats.",M1
14985241,"Development and use of an ovarian synchronization model to study the effects of endogenous estrogen and nitric oxide on uterine blood flow during ovarian cycles in sheep.The objective of the current study was to develop an ovine animal model for consistent study of uterine blood flow (UBF) changes during synchronized ovarian cycles regardless of season. Sheep were surgically bilaterally instrumented with uterine artery blood flow transducers and 5-7 days later implanted with a vaginal progesterone (P(4))-controlled internal drug-releasing device (CIDR; 0.3 g) for 7 days. On Day 6 of P(4), sheep were given two prostaglandin F(2 alpha) injections (7.5 mg i.m. 4 h apart). At CIDR removal, Experimental Day 0, zero (n = 9), 500 IU (n = 8), or 1000 IU (n = 7) <e>eCG</e> was injected i.m.; UBF was monitored continuously for 55-75 h. Jugular blood was sampled every 8 h to evaluate levels of P(4), estradiol-17 beta (E(2)beta) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was infused in a stepwise fashion unilaterally into one uterine artery at 48-50 h after 500 IU eCG and the effects on UBF were examined (n = 7). The zero-eCG group gradually increased UBF from a baseline of 17.4 +/- 3.9 to 80.5 +/- 1.1 ml/min. The 500-IU-eCG group increased UBF between 10 and 15 h from a baseline of 11 +/- 3.3 to 83.3 +/- 1.0 ml/min, whereas UBF for the 1000-IU-eCG group was higher (100.1 +/- 1.7 ml/min) than that seen in either of the other groups. Plasma P(4) fell to baseline within 8 h of CIDR removal, while E(2)beta rose gradually in association with elevations in UBF. LH surges occurred between 32 and 56 h after CIDR removal and the LH surge occurred earlier in the 1000-IU-eCG group than the other two groups (P &lt; 0.01). L-NAME infusion dose dependently reduced maximum levels of UBF ipsilaterally by 54.6% +/- 6.2%, but contralaterally only by 27.4% +/- 8.5%. Regardless of season, either dose of eCG will result in analogous UBF responses. During the follicular phase, elevations in UBF are in part locally controlled by the de novo production of nitric oxide.",M1
14698061,"The effect of <e>eCG</e> or estradiol at or after norgestomet removal on follicular dynamics, estrus and ovulation in early post-partum beef cows nursing calves.In post-partum anestrous beef cows suckling calves, neither the choice of hormonal regime to ensure the presence of a healthy dominant follicle at the end of a progestagen treatment nor the optimum hormone to induce estrus and ovulation is clear. Twenty-eight beef cows, in good body condition, 25-30 days post-partum, were assigned to one of four treatments: (i) 3mg norgestomet (N) implant with 5mg estradiol valerate (EDV) and 3mg N injection at the time of insertion (Crestar) for 5 days followed by 600 IU eCG at the time of implant removal; (ii) Crestar for 5 days as in (i) followed by 0.75 mg estradiol benzoate (EDB) 24h later; (iii) Crestar for 9 days followed by 600 IU eCG at the time of implant removal; and (iv) Crestar for 9 days followed by 0.75 mg EDB 24h later. Ovarian scanning was preformed from 4 days before implant insertion until ovulation and 4 days postovulation to detect the CL. Daily blood samples were collected from day 20 post-partum until second ovulation for FSH and E(2) assay. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. There was no effect of the stage of follicle wave at the time of implant insertion on interval to new follicle wave emergence (range 1-7 days; mean 4.7 days). FSH concentrations were decreased to 5.9+/-2.0 and 7.7+/-1.1 ng/ml for pre- and post-selection cows 1 day after start of treatment; thereafter, they increased on Day 2 to 7.9+/-2.0 and 11.0+/-1.1 ng/ml and on Day 3 to 10.3+/-2.7 and 11.4+/-1.7 ng/ml for pre- and post-selection cows, respectively, despite high-estradiol concentrations at that time. There was no effect of treatment on the interval from implant removal to ovulation (3.2-4.0 days) or on the number of cows detected in estrus (26 of 27 cows). The size of the ovulatory follicle in cows given 0.75 mg EDB 24h post implant removal was decreased in animals at the pre-selection stage (12.2+/-0.1mm) of the follicle wave compared with those at the post-selection stage (15.3+/-0.9 mm) at implant removal. Cows given 600 IU eCG at the pre-selection phase of follicular growth had multiple ovulations (4.0+/-1.1). Cows given EDV at the start of a 5-day implant period had higher estradiol concentrations before and on the day of implant removal than those given EDV at the start of a 9-day implant period. The injection of 0.75 mg EDB 1 day after implant removal tended to increase concentrations of estradiol one day later. In conclusion, 5mg EDV and 3mg N at insertion of a 3mg N implant resulted in variable new follicle wave emergence 1-7 days later in post-partum beef cows nursing calves (22 of 27); both eCG and EDB were equally effective at inducing estrus after implant removal in cows in good BCS, but eCG resulted in a significant increase in ovulation rate in cows treated before dominant follicle selection.",M1
14662138,"Effects of a GnRH agonist on oocyte number and maturation in mice superovulated with <e>eCG</e> and hCG.The objective was to investigate the effects of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) on ovulation rate and the number and maturation of oocytes in mice superovulated with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Thirty 3-month-old BALB/C female mice (weight: 25-30 g) were assigned to three experimental groups: control, superovulated, and superovulated with GnRH pretreatment (n=10 per group). Control mice received an i.p. injection of 0.1 ml physiological saline solution. Superovulation was induced with 5 IU eCG (i.p.) and 5 IU hCG 48 h later. Mice in the superovulated with GnRH pretreatment group were given GnRH (20 mg/kg Fertirelin, i.m.), 24 h before superovulation. Thirteen hours after hCG administration, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and blood samples were collected to determine serum progesterone concentration (by radioimmunoassay). Ovaries and oviducts were also harvested to enumerate corpora lutea and cumulus-enclosed oocytes. Progesterone concentrations were not significantly different among groups. The oocyte number and the maturation, ovulation rate, and the number of corpora lutea were higher in GnRH-treated mice than both controls and superovulated mice. In conclusion, GnRH given 24 h before superovulation with eCG-hCG increased the number and maturation of oocytes and the rate of ovulation in mice.",M1
14662131,"Ultrasound and endocrine evaluation of the ovarian response to a single dose of 500 IU of <e>eCG</e> following a 12-day treatment with progestogen-releasing intravaginal sponges in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons in ewes.A standard dose of 500 IU of eCG is commonly given to progestogen pre-treated anestrous ewes for induction of estrus. Twelve seasonally anestrous and 12 cyclic Western White Face ewes were treated for 12 days with intravaginal sponges impregnated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP). In trials in both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons, six randomly selected ewes were given 500 IU of eCG at sponge removal to determine the effects of low dose of eCG on ovarian antral follicular dynamics and ovulation. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling were done daily. Treatment with eCG did not have marked effects on antral follicular growth. All ewes ovulated, except for five of six control anestrous ewes. Luteal structures and progesterone secretion were confirmed in all but the control anestrous ewes. In the breeding season, peak progesterone concentrations were greater (P&lt;0.05) in eCG-treated compared to control ewes. Daily serum estradiol concentrations were greater in the periovulatory period in eCG-treated compared to control ewes (treatment-by-day interaction; P&lt;0.05), particularly in anestrus. Progestogen-treated ewes ovulated follicles from several follicular waves, in contrast to ovulations of follicles from the final wave of the cycle in untreated, cyclic ewes. Anestrous ewes exhibited more frequent follicular waves and FSH peaks compared to cyclic ewes after a progestogen/eCG treatment. In conclusion, 500 IU of eCG given after 12 days of progestogen treatment had limited effects on the dynamics of ovarian follicular waves. However, eCG treatment increased serum concentrations of estradiol during the periovulatory period, particularly in anestrous ewes; this probably resulted in the synchronous estrus and ovulation in anestrous ewes.",M1
14611638,"Stimulatory effects of fasting on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by growing pig ovarian follicles.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fasting on both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and VEGF mRNA expression in growing ovarian follicles (&gt;5 mm in diameter) from gilts at 48 h after equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) treatment. The concentrations of VEGF and albumin were measured in the follicular fluid of single follicles, and VEGF mRNA was determined in the follicle wall. Fasting resulted in a significant increase in VEGF concentrations in follicular fluid (20.64+/-0.72 versus 10.79+/-0.86 ng ml(-1), P&lt;0.001), but it did not affect the total amount of VEGF mRNA in the follicle wall compared with that of fed animals. However, VEGF mRNA in the theca and granulosa compartments increased and decreased, respectively, compared with that of fed animals. The concentrations of albumin measured in follicular fluid as an index of vessel permeability were higher in fasted than in animals fed normally, most likely as a result of the increased VEGF production. Follicular steroidogenesis was impaired in fasted animals. Progesterone was the most abundant steroid in the follicular fluid and oestradiol was present in lower concentrations, thus indicating an alteration in the steroidogenic enzymatic cascade. In conclusion, fasting induces an increase in both VEGF production and vessel permeability. Such a reaction is unable under severe food deprivation to preserve follicle function, but may represent a mechanism that regulates blood vessel extension and distribution in relation to tissue requirements and availability of systemic nutrient.",M1
12950689,"Successful non-surgical transfer of horse embryos to mule recipients.Mules, hybrids resulting from the mating of a horse mare (Equus caballus, 2n = 64) to a Jack donkey (E. asinus, 2n = 62), are generally infertile. Five horse embryos were transferred non-surgically to two cyclic and one acyclic recipient mules. In the mares and cycling mules, oestrus and ovulation were induced with, respectively, d-cloprostenol and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The acyclic mule, on the other hand, received oestradiol benzoate when the embryo donor was showing oestrus and progesterone after the donor had ovulated and until pregnancy diagnosis. Non-surgical embryo collections were attempted on day 7 after ovulation and recovered embryos were transferred transcervically into the mules' uteri. Mules that became pregnant were blood sampled serially for equine chorion gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>), progestagen and total conjugated oestrogen concentrations until around 6 months of gestation. The three embryos transferred to the acyclic mule did not produce any pregnancies whereas both embryos transferred to the cycling mules resulted in the birth of live foals. The peak concentration and duration of secretion of eCG differed markedly between the two pregnant mules, although both animals appeared to develop secondary corpora lutea beyond day 40 of gestation, as in normal intraspecies horse pregnancy. Moreover, the rise in serum oestrogen concentrations from around day 90 was also similar to that seen in normal pregnant mares. Parturition occurred spontaneously on day 348 of gestation in both mules and the resulting colt foals developed normally to weaning. Thus, cycling mules can carry a horse conceptus after non-surgical embryo transfer and give birth to a normal mature foal.",M1
12916761,"Experimental model to study reproductive toxicity of chemicals using induced ovulation in immature F344 rats.We investigated a simple method using induced ovulation in immature rats to detect ovarian injury due to chemicals. We investigated the influence of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on ovulation induced by equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) in immature F344 rats. Single injections of 15 and 30 iu eCG induced ovulation in 4 of 6 rats and in all of 4 rats, respectively. The mean number of ovulated ova was 12.7 in the 15 iu eCG group and 8.0 in the 30 iu group. When rats received 4 daily doses of DEHP at 500 mg/kg, ovulation occurred in 4 of 6 rats in the 15 iu eCG group and in 1 of 3 rats in the 30 iu group. Mean numbers of ovulated ova were 2.50 and 0.33 ova in the 15 and 30 iu groups, respectively. Changes in ovarian and uterine weights were not found. Inhibition of ovulation by the injection of DEHP indicated the utility of induced ovulation in immature rats to detect reproductive toxicity in females.",M1
12840817,"Effects of meiosis-inhibiting agents and equine chorionic gonadotropin on nuclear maturation of canine oocytes.Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of meiosis-inhibiting-agents and gonadotropins on nuclear maturation of canine oocytes. The culture medium was TCM199 + 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor supplemented with 25 microM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mM pyruvate, and 1.0 mM L-glutamine (Basal TCM). Initially, oocytes were cultured in Basal TCM alone or in Basal TCM + dibutylryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (0.5, 1, 5, or 10 mM dbcAMP) for 24 hr. Dibutylryl cAMP inhibited resumption of meiosis in a dose-dependent manner; 60% of oocytes remained at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage after being cultured for 24 hr in 5 mM dbcAMP. The meiosis-inhibitory effect of dbcAMP appeared to be reversible, as the oocytes resumed meiosis and completed nuclear maturation after being cultured for an additional 48 hr in its absence. Oocytes were then cultured in Basal TCM alone or in Basal TCM + roscovitine (12.5, 25, or 50 microM) for 24 hr. Although approximately 60% of oocytes cultured in 25 microM roscovitine remained at the GV stage, this percentage was not significantly different from the 48% that also remained at the GV stage when cultured in its absence. Oocytes were cultured in Basal TCM + 25 microM roscovitine for 17 hr, exposed briefly to equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>), and then cultured in Basal TCM for 48 hr. Short exposure of oocytes to eCG was beneficial, as it significantly increased the proportion of oocytes developing beyond germinal vesicle breakdown (P &lt; 0.05) with approximately 20-30% of these were metaphase I (MI) oocytes. Study of the kinetics of nuclear maturation demonstrated that large numbers of oocytes remained at MI even after being cultured for 52 hr following brief exposure to eCG. This study showed that in vitro maturation of canine oocytes can be somewhat improved by short exposure of oocytes to eCG. However, further studies are still required to derive effective methods to mature canine oocytes in vitro.",M1
12773101,"E- and N-cadherin expression and distribution during luteinization in the rat ovary.Cadherins, a family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules, play an important role in ovarian tissue remodelling processes. The aim of this study was to examine the expression pattern of E- and N-cadherin in rat preovulatory follicles, luteinizing follicles and corpora lutea. Immature female rats were treated with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) to promote preovulatory follicle development. At 48 h after eCG treatment, the rats were injected with an ovulatory dose of hCG. Ovaries were analysed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence for E- and N-cadherin expression at 48 h after eCG injection, and at 24 and 72 h after hCG injection. Ovaries of cyclic adult rats were examined to assess whether the changes in the expression pattern of cadherin were in agreement with those of the gonadotrophin-treated rats. Finally, expression of E-cadherin in luteinizing granulosa cells in vitro was assessed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence results indicate that E-cadherin is expressed in the theca-interstial cells surrounding preovulatory follicles. N-cadherin expression is prominent in the membrana granulosa of these follicles. The initiation of luteinization with hCG leads to a decreased expression of N-cadherin in the membrana granulosa, whereas expression of E-cadherin starts within the luteinizing follicle. Both cadherins are prominently expressed in the fully formed corpus luteum at 72 h after hCG treatment. Immunofluorescence results revealed that the patterns of E- and N-cadherin expression in the gonadotrophin-treated rats were similar to those of the cyclic adult rats. Western blot analysis reflected similar changes for N-cadherin in the ovaries of both the cyclic adults and gonadotrophin-treated rats; however, they were different in E-cadherin expression. The expression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein was induced in vitro in luteinized granulosa cells. These results support the hypothesis that modulation of cadherin expression is an integral component of remodelling processes, including corpus luteum formation, in the ovary. The results also indicate that expression of E- and N-cadherin in granulosa-lutein cells appear to be under hormonal control.",M1
12606484,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in ovarian follicles of gonadotropin-stimulated rats is regulated by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.The aim of the present study was to examine the acute and chronic effects of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) leuprolide acetate (LA) on the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), and steroid production in antral ovarian follicles obtained from prepubertal equine choriogonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>)-treated rats. Follicular contents of StAR and P450scc proteins were measured by Western blotting following in vivo injection of eCG (control) and eCG+LA (LA) to prepubertal rats. Treatment with eCG for 2 h resulted in no change in StAR protein content, but it was markedly increased at 4 and 8 h after hormone treatment. However, coadministration of eCG+LA produced a significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in StAR protein levels at 2, 4, and 8 h when compared with eCG treatment. Acute and chronic treatment with either eCG or eCG+LA did not alter the P450scc protein levels in freshly isolated follicles. The increase in StAR protein expression following LA treatment was qualitatively similar to StAR mRNA expression, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, administration of eCG demonstrated a time-dependent increase (2-8 h) in the levels of StAR mRNA, and these levels were markedly increased by eCG+LA. However, the temporal response pattern of StAR mRNA was much greater at 2 h following LA administration when compared with controls. In addition, 48 h of LA treatment in eCG-treated rats resulted in a significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in follicular progesterone levels, whereas significant decreases in androgen (testosterone and androsterone) and estradiol levels were observed. Similar results were obtained when serum androgens and estradiol were measured, but serum progesterone levels were unchanged. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of LA on ovarian androgen and estradiol levels is related to changes in the follicular levels of StAR protein and steroid production.",M1
12604630,"Assessment of oocyte quality following repeated gonadotropin stimulation in the mouse.The present study assessed the effects of repeated ovarian stimulation on oocyte quality. Female mice were stimulated with <e>eCG</e> and hCG at 1-wk intervals for 4 wk. Germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes were evaluated in relation to size, somatic cell association, and chromatin organization after each week of stimulation. In addition, ATP content and expression of meiotic competence were monitored in GV and in vivo (IVO) or in vitro (IVM)-matured oocytes. The developmental competence of ovulated oocytes was determined after in vitro fertilization and embryo culture, and reproductive outcome was evaluated after mating following repeated cycles of stimulation. In GV oocytes, the degree of somatic cell association, size, and timing of transcriptional repression were altered when comparing repeated with single cycle(s) of stimulation. Meiotic competence expression was unaffected for IVO oocytes while IVM oocytes exhibited a progressive decrease in meiotic competence with repeated stimulation. The ATP content of immature and IVO oocytes decreased with repeated stimulation. Although after one cycle of stimulation ATP content was lower in IVM than IVO oocytes, IVM oocytes exhibited stable levels of ATP across cycles of stimulation. Last, the in vitro developmental competence of IVO oocytes retrieved after repeated stimulation was not significantly different, and in vivo, similar implantation and resorption rates were observed following mating of animals subjected to repeated stimulation. Therefore, despite measurable consequences of repeated stimulation on specific parameters of follicular oocyte quality, compensatory mechanisms may exist in vivo to optimize the developmental competence of ovulated oocytes in the mouse.",M1
12517381,"Effects of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) on follicle development and granulosa-cell apoptosis in the pig.The effect of eCG on follicular development and granulosa-cell apoptosis in sexually mature and immature gilts and on granulosa-cell apoptosis in vitro were studied. The sexually mature gilts were treated with eCG on Day 11 of the estrous cycle, and effects were analyzed at different times after treatment with untreated animals at corresponding stages of the cycle as controls. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), hematoxylin and eosin staining, and DNA ladder. The proportion of apoptotic cells in atretic follicles (39%) was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than that in healthy follicles (9%). At 24h after eCG treatment in mature gilts, the total number of follicles visible on the ovarian surface (57 per ovary), the number of small (&lt;3mm) follicles (31.5 per ovary) and the number of medium-sized (3-5mm) follicles (23 per ovary) were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than those of control animals (28, 20 and 6.5 per ovary, respectively), and declined gradually thereafter to below the level of control animals. The number of large (&gt;or=5mm) follicles began to show a marked increase at 72h after eCG (8.5 versus 2.5, P&lt;0.05). At 24h after eCG treatment, the proportions of apoptotic cells in small (7.2%) and medium-sized follicles (7.4%) were markedly lower (P&lt;0.01) than those in controls (21.5 and 21%, respectively) and increased gradually thereafter to approach the level in controls. The percentage of apoptotic cells in large follicles (10% at 24h post-eCG) did not change significantly. Before eCG treatment, there were markedly fewer follicles of all types on ovaries of immature gilts than of mature gilts (9 versus 25 per ovary) and the proportion of apoptotic cells in small and medium follicles was high (25 and 34%, respectively). After eCG treatment, the changes in follicle number and proportion of apoptotic cells in the immature gilts followed a similar pattern to that of the mature gilts. Equine chorion gonadotropin inhibited apoptosis of granulosa cells cultured either in vitro or in intact follicles in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, follicular atresia in the pig, as in other animals, was characterized by apoptosis of large numbers of granulosa cells, and eCG promoted follicular development by inhibition of granulosa-cell apoptosis.",M1
12493716,"Localization and expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 in the immature gonadotropin-stimulated and adult rat ovary.The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are important regulators of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteolytic enzymes essential for controlling the coordinated tissue remodeling that takes place in the ovary. In the present study, we characterized the ovarian expression pattern of TIMP-4. The localization of TIMP-4 mRNA was determined by in situ hybridization in adult cycling rats. TIMP-4 mRNA on the day of estrus was expressed in a punctate pattern in stroma and in corpora lutea (CL) from previous cycles but not in newly formed CL or follicles. At metestrus, TIMP-4 mRNA was present in certain CL from the current and previous cycles and continued to exhibit a punctate pattern of expression in the stroma. By diestrus, TIMP-4 mRNA was detected in the thecal layer surrounding follicles, and a relatively high level of expression was observed in a punctate pattern within new and previous CL and in the stroma. TIMP-4 mRNA was also observed in the thecal layer at proestrus, but the punctate pattern within CL and stroma was absent. To correlate the changes in cellular localization with changes in overall TIMP-4 levels, ovarian mRNA and protein levels were examined in adult cycling rats and in gonadotropin-stimulated immature rats. In cycling rats, there was no change in mRNA or protein levels across the cycle, although there was a trend towards higher levels during estrus (P = 0.08). In gonadotropin-treated rats, there was an increase in TIMP-4 mRNA 48 h after <e>eCG</e> administration with a corresponding doubling of TIMP-4 protein. Although TIMP-4 mRNA and protein tended to decline after hCG treatment, this trend was not significant (P = 0.08). These findings indicate that TIMP-4 could play an important role in regulating MMPs in a localized manner in follicles and CL throughout the cycle.",M1
12237522,"Plasma steroid profiles following follicle-stimulating hormone or equine chorionic gonadotropin injection in cows chronically treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.Plasma steroid profiles following follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) injection were studied in chronically gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-A)-treated cows. Follicular development and irINH secretion were stimulated by FSH or eCG injection. The plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta (E(2)) and testosterone (T) were markedly increased following eCG injection. However, significant increases of the plasma E(2) and T concentrations were not detected in FSH-treated cows. Ovulation of developed follicles were depended on the hCG injection in both groups. These results show: 1) Follicular response to an exogenous gonadotropin is still remained, 2) Ovulation of developed follicles is induced by hCG injection and 3) FSH and eCG cause disparate plasma steroid profiles, under the influence of repeated GnRH-A treatment.",M1
12113178,"Improving reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows by synchronizing ovulation or inducing oestrus.Lactating crossbred Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 331) were started on an Ovsynch regimen 68 +/- 8.2 days after calving; 200 micrograms GnRH intramuscularly (i.m.) on Days 0 and 9, and 35 mg prostaglandin F2 alpha i.m. on Day 7. Thirty-eight and 31 cows (11.5 and 9.4%, respectively) were in oestrus on Days 0 to 6 and 7 to 8, respectively, and inseminated, and the remainder were fixed-time inseminated (on Day 10). For these three groups, pregnancy rates (60-65 days after breeding) were 31.6, 38.7 and 34.0%, respectively (P = 0.82) and calving rates were 100, 100 and 89.9% (P = 0.23). In a preliminary trial, twelve lactating cows (45 to 60 days postpartum) with inactive ovaries were given 1500 IU <e>eCG</e> i.m.; 10 were in oestrus within 10 days after treatment (and inseminated) and eight of these were pregnant (30 days after breeding). The Ovsynch program resulted in acceptable reproductive performance in cyclic cows and eCG treatment has considerable promise for inducing oestrus in anoestrous cows.",M1
12006094,"Regulation of cyclooxygenase activity and progesterone production in the rat corpus luteum by inducible nitric oxide synthase.This study explores interactions between the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways in the regulation of progesterone production in early corpus luteum cells of rats. Nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E (PGE) and progesterone production was analysed in luteal cells of the rat corpus luteum exposed to inhibitors of non-specific NOS, inhibitors of inducible NOS (iNOS) and inhibitors of COX. Equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>)/hCG-primed rat corpus luteum cells produced NO, PGE and progesterone in a linear manner during 66 h of culture. Exposure of the cells to the non-specific NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (0.15 mmol l(-1)) for 48 h reduced NO, PGE and progesterone production to 21, 32 and 60% of that of the controls, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.01). Another non-specific NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine, produced similar inhibitions. Exposure of the cultured cells to S-ethylisothiourea (1 mmol l(-1)), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, suppressed the production of NO by 63%, PGE by 69% and progesterone by 48%. These findings indicate that production of PGE is regulated partly by iNOS, and that progesterone is probably regulated indirectly by the secondary changes in PGE. The addition of arachidonic acid to N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine-treated cells resulted in a significant increase in PGE and progesterone production (273 and 186%, respectively) without stimulating NO production. In contrast to the regulation exerted by the NO system on COX activity, the COX system does not modulate NO production in this model. This notion stems from the observation that the COX inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid (5 mmol l(-1)) and indomethacin (5 micromol l(-1)) suppressed PGE by 86 and 89%, respectively, and progesterone by 34 and 57%, respectively, but failed to inhibit NO production. The results from the present study indicate that iNOS-mediated NO production is involved in stimulating PGE synthesis in rat luteal cells, which may upregulate progesterone production.",M1
11993798,"Four years of induction/synchronization of estrus in dairy goats: effect on the evolution of <e>eCG</e> binding rate in relation with the parameters of reproduction.Ninety-eight Alpine goats of two herds were followed over 4 years in a program of annual artificial insemination after estrus induction/synchronization, including progestagen administration (vaginal sponge) followed by prostaglandin analog and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) 48 h before sponge removal. Goats were sampled every 4 hours from the 16th to the 56th following sponge removal, for determination of LH surge and tested for estrus by the presence of a buck. Seven days after AI, endoscopic examination of the ovaries was performed to determine the number of corpus lutea. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at day 21-22 post AI by determination of plasma progesterone and at day 40-45 by ultrasonography. Parturition, number and sex of kids were recorded. All the goats were sampled before and after each treatment, for anti-eCG antibodies screening. Statistical analysis of the results clearly established a significant effect of the treatments on anti-eCG antibodies. Time of estrus and LH surge were significantly different between herd. The antibodies significantly delayed the time of coming out of estrus as well as the time of LH surge. Two antagonistic effects were evidenced: first, the delayed of time of estrus and time of LH surge in relation with the immune reaction to eCG; secondly, the ahead of time of estrus and time of LH surge during the years of treatment, identical to both herd. The antibodies negatively influenced the percentage of ovulating females as well as kidding rate. Finally, no effect of antibodies on prolificacy was found.",M1
11882247,"Treatment of unobserved oestrus in a dairy cattle herd with low oestrous detection rate up to 60 days post-partum.The efficiency of treatments for unobserved oestrus and their effect on the reproductive performance of a dairy cattle herd with low oestrous detection rate till 60 days post-partum (dpp), attributed to the declivous and slippery concrete floor were investigated. The herdsman requested advice in order to improve the mean days open of the herd, but no investments were allowed because a new unit was about to be built. Due to the low oestrus detection rate of the herd, the breeding policy was to inseminate at the first detected post-partum oestrus. Cows were examined at 20-30 dpp to assess uterine involution, ovarian activity and prevalence of reproductive disorders and, at 60 dpp if no previous oestrus was detected. Each examination included palpation per rectum, ultrasound scanning and collection of a blood sample for plasma progesterone (P4) measurement. Cows with unobserved oestrus till 60 dpp were allocated either to a treatment group (n=139) or to a control group (n=139). Three treatments were used: (a) injection of PGF(2 alpha) (PG) upon detection of a corpus luteum (CL; n = 30), cows not observed in oestrus being re-injected 11-12 days later. AI was at oestrus; (b) PRID (n=35) or Crestar (n=74) devices kept in situ for 12 and 9 days, respectively, were associated to an injection of PG and of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) at device removal. Cows were double-fixed time-inseminated at 48 and 72 h after device removal. All treated cows were examined at 48-72 h after treatment to confirm oestrus. The percentage of cows detected in oestrus up to 60 dpp remained unchanged through the trial (35 and 47% for years before intervention: 1994-95; 51 and 48% for years of intervention: 1996-97). In contrast, the oestrous detection rate was high both in treated (93%) and control (100%) cows. This possibly resulted from an improvement in the oestrous detection efficiency of the herd's personnel and from examination of cows at 48-72 h after treatment. Treated and control cows had identical conception rate (CR; 36 and 37%, respectively) and reproductive performance. However, the mean days open of the herd in 1996 was significantly improved in comparison with previous years (mean +/- SEM: 134 +/- 6, 126 +/- 5, 110 +/- 4 and 114 +/- 5 days, for years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively, p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA). Conception rate to AI up to 40 dpp was significantly reduced, compared with the period between 60 and 100 dpp but, mean days open were significantly improved in cows inseminated up to 60 dpp, compared with thereafter (p &lt; 0.05).",M1
11834441,"The influence of maternal size on placental, fetal and postnatal growth in the horse. II. Endocrinology of pregnancy.Within-breed artificial insemination and between-breed embryo transfer were carried out in small pony (P) and large Thoroughbred (Tb) mares to create 4 types of horse pregnancy in which the fetus experienced spatial and nutritional deprivation (Tb-in-P; n=8), luxury (P-in-Tb; n=7) or normality (Tb-in-Tb; n=7 and P-in-P; n=7) in utero. Measurement of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>), total conjugated oestrogens and progestagen concentrations in serial peripheral serum samples recovered from all the mares throughout gestation showed that the amount of eCG produced during the first half of gestation was dependent upon the breed of the mare rather than the breed of the fetus being carried. In contrast, the mean total amounts of oestrogens produced, as measured by area under the curve, were significantly greater (P=0.003) in the two types of pregnancy in which a Thoroughbred fetus was being carried (Tb-in-Tb and Tb-in-P) than those in which a pony fetus was gestated (P-in-P and P-in-Tb); the evidence suggests that the Tb fetus may have larger gonads than the P fetus and thereby secrete more C-19 precursor steroids for aromatisation to oestrogens by the placenta. In the final weeks of pregnancy mean plasma progestagen concentrations rose much earlier, and to significantly higher levels (P&lt;0.001), in the Tb-in-P than in the P-in-Tb pregnancies, thereby reflecting the increased fetal stress in the former causing premature maturation of the fetal adrenal gland. This, in turn, resulted in increased secretion of pregnenolone by the adrenal cortex for conversion to progestagens by the placenta.",M1
11818023,"Successful production of offspring after superovulation and in vitro culture of embryos from domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furos).In an effort to expand the use of ferrets as models for genetic disease, several experimental parameters that are required for successful genetic manipulation in this species were investigated. Optimum superovulation (19.3 +/- 0.6 oocytes and embryos per female) was achieved after injections of 100 iu equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) and 150 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The ovulation rate achieved by the treatment was more than double that induced by mating. Mating with a male immediately after hCG treatment did not significantly alter the number of oocytes ovulated or the number of embryos present, indicating that mating is not required for superovulation in ferrets. Of embryos harvested at the one-cell stage, 64.5% and 47.1% developed into blastocysts when cultured in vitro in CZB or TCM-199 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) media, respectively. In contrast, only 17.1% of embryos cultured in vitro in NCSU-23 developed to the blastocyst stage. Both freshly retrieved and in vitro cultured embryos from cinnamon-coloured parents produced live young when transferred at the eight-cell stage into albino, pseudo-pregnant recipients. The percentage of kits delivered relative to embryos transferred was 61% for freshly retrieved embryos and 32% for embryos cultured in vitro. These results demonstrate successful embryo transfer in ferrets and provide a basis for further study of genetic modelling approaches in this species after embryo manipulation.",M1
11755711,"Embryo yield and plasma progesterone profiles in superovulated dairy cows and heifers.This study was conducted to compare the superovulatory (SOV) response of dairy cows (n=172) and heifers (n=172), with two SOV treatments started at the mid-luteal-phase of the estrus cycle. Donors were randomly treated either with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) plus neutra-eCG serum (eCG+N group, n=167) or follicle stimulating gonadotrophin (FSH-P group, n=177). No significant differences were observed among groups in the percentage of superovulatory responsive donors (SR donors; corpora lutea (CL) &gt;/=2), the mean number of total ova, fertilized ova and viable embryos recovered. Cows yielded significantly less total ova and less fertilized ova (P&lt;0.05) and tended to yield less viable embryos (P&lt;0.06) than heifers. Plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations (n=135 donors) on the day of PGF(2alpha) (PGF) injection and on the day of SOV estrus were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in eCG+N than in FSH-P donors and, the increase between those 2 days was also significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in group eCG+N than in group FSH-P, suggesting a higher luteotrophic effect of eCG than FSH-P. SR donors had P4 levels significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) than non-SR donors only on day 5 after the SOV estrus and on the day of embryo recovery. Plasma P4 concentrations at 5 days after the SOV estrus and at embryo recovery correlated significantly (r=0.76, P&lt;0.001).Heifers had significantly higher P4 levels than cows at gonadotrophin injection (P&lt;0.01), PGF injection (P&lt;0.001), 5 days (P&lt;0.01) and 7 days (P&lt;0.001) after the SOV estrus. At day 7 after the SOV estrus, P4 concentrations per ova recovered were significantly higher in heifers than in cows (P&lt;0.01). The increase of plasma P4 per ova recovered, between days 5 and 7 after the SOV estrus, was significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher in heifers than in cows. Also, the increase of plasma P4 between injections of gonadotrophin and PGF was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in heifers than in cows.These results suggest that heifers have higher plasma P4 concentrations at diestrus (either before or after the SOV treatment) and this is associated with a higher embryo yield and quality, as compared to lactating cows. These higher plasma P4 concentrations reflect not only differences in ovulation rate as well as the competence of the corpus luteum, which is potentialized by gonadotrophin stimulation.",M1
11690542,"Superovulation, fertilization and in vitro embryo development in mice after administration of an inhibin-neutralizing antiserum.The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of immunoneutralization against endogenous inhibin on oocyte and embryo production in adult and immature mice. At 12:00 h on day 2 of oestrus (day 1 of dioestrus), a single i.p. injection of inhibin antiserum (50, 100, 200 or 400 microl per animal) or equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>; 10 or 20 iu per animal) or control goat serum (100 microl per animal) was administered to adult female mice. After 48 h, the mice in each of the three groups were given a single i.p. injection of hCG (10 iu per animal). At 42 h after hCG injection, ova were collected from oviducts and cultured in KSOM solution. Treatments with both inhibin antiserum-hCG and eCG-hCG induced superovulation in all the animals tested. The number of oocytes in animals treated with inhibin antiserum was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group, and the number of oocytes ovulated in animals treated with 200 or 400 ml inhibin antiserum was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that in animals treated with 10 or 20 iu eCG. The superovulated oocytes that were fertilized normally in vivo were able to form blastocysts in vitro. The rate of blastocyst development for animals treated with 50-200 ml inhibin antiserum was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that of the eCG-treated animals. Irrespective of the day of the oestrous cycle, 200 microl inhibin antiserum administered at 12:00 h on each of 4 days induced superovulation in all the animals tested. The rates of oocyte and embryo production by these animals were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than in the control groups. Furthermore, administration of inhibin antiserum at doses of 50, 100, 200 or 400 ml produced similar results in 26-day-old immature mice. These results indicate that passive immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin alpha-subunit induces superovulation in immature and adult mice. The superovulated oocytes obtained by administration of inhibin antiserum have normal embryonic developmental competence. Thus, it is concluded that this inhibin antiserum method is a new practical alternative for induction of superovulation in mice instead of the more commonly used eCG-hCG protocol.",M1
11592721,"Sheep embryos derived from FSH/<e>eCG</e> treatment have a lower in vitro viability after vitrification than those derived from FSH treatment.In the non breeding period, the effect of two superovulatory treatments (eCG/FSH in single dose or FSH alone in four decreasing doses) on the production of embryo quality following in vitro viability after vitrification procedures was investigated using forty-four adult Sarda breed ewes. In sheep treated with eCG/FSH, the mean number of corpora lutea was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher (11.8+/-4.0 vs. 8.05+/-3.8), although the recovery rate was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower (74.6 vs. 59.9) than with FSH alone. After vitrification (ethylene glycol and glycerol) was repeated three times, the rates of re-expansion at first and second warming were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in embryos derived from FSH alone than in those with both gonadotrophins (94.9 and 41.9 vs. 72.8 and 18.6) and after the last vitrification the hatched blastocyst rates were 22.5 and 7.6. After differential stain, blastocysts derived from FSH alone showed a mean number of cells significantly higher than blastocysts from eCG/FSH (184.2 vs. 157.7). It was concluded that superovulatory treatment with eCG/FSH may increase the ovarian responses compared with FSH alone, but these embryos showed a reduction in viability rates after repeated vitrification.",M1
11592718,"Increase of plasma <e>eCG</e> binding rate after administration of repeated high dose of eCG to cows.Equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) is still used to promote follicular growth in cattle and, more recently with an increased frequency of administration, in ovum pick-up protocols. The aim of this experiment was to verify the possible effect of high frequency of administration on the immune response to eCG. The profiles of eCG binding rate, in the blood of two groups (A, B) of 4 primiparous cross breed beef cows (3-3.5 years old) submitted weekly for 5 to 10 weeks to repeated high doses (1000-2000 IU) of equine chorionic gonadotrophin, are presented in this paper. A sensitive radiometric method was used to detect antibodies in plasma. The profiles clearly indicated a marked increase of eCG binding rate after 3 to 5 injections of the exogenous hormone to the females. The statistical analysis of the results established that treatments induced a significant increase (P &lt; 0.01) in binding rates after 6 and 3 injections in group A and B respectively. These binding rates remained elevated for at least 1 week following the last injection and decreased afterwards. The values of plasma binding rates following repeated eCG administration differed significantly between groups (0.90+/-1.04 and 1.04+/-0.11 for groups A and B before treatment versus 11.77+/-0.92, 6.70+/-0.85 for groups A and B after treatment, P &lt; 0.01) and from one cow to another (P &lt; 0.01) with some cows presenting no significant immune response while others were more reactive against the hormone (at least 3 injections).",M1
11572789,"Immortalization of equine trophoblast cell lines of chorionic girdle cell lineage by simian virus-40 large T antigen.Immortalized cell lines have many potential experimental applications including the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying cell-specific gene expression. We have utilized a recombinant retrovirus encoding the simian virus-40 (SV-40) large T antigen to construct several immortalized cell lines of equine chorionic girdle cell lineage - the progenitor cells that differentiate into the equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) producing endometrial cups. Morphologically, the immortalized cell lines appear similar to normal chorionic girdle cells. Derivation of the immortalized cell lines from a chorionic girdle cell lineage was verified by immunological detection of cell-surface antigens specific to equine invasive trophoblasts. The cell lines differed, however, from mature chorionic girdle cells or endometrial cup cells in that they did not produce eCG and did express MHC class I molecules. Thus, these cell lines appear to have been arrested at a stage of development prior to final differentiation into endometrial cup cells. It was also determined that some of these cell lines as well as endometrial cups express the estrogen receptor-related receptor beta gene, but not the glial cell missing gene (GCMa) both of which are expressed in the murine and human placenta. Among these cell lines, three (eCG 50.5, 100.6 and 500.1) express eCG alpha mRNA. Since regulation of eCG alpha subunit gene is largely unknown, we investigated the signal transduction pathways regulating the eCG alpha subunit gene. Both activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) induced the expression of eCG alpha subunit expression 3.2 (P&lt;0.05)- and 1.9 (P&lt;0.05)-fold respectively, in the eCG 500.1 cell line. However, activation of these pathways failed to induce eCG beta subunit expression. In conclusion, lines of equine trophoblast cells have been immortalized that display markers characteristic of those with the equine chorionic girdle and endometrial cup cell lineage. A subset of these cells expresses the eCG alpha subunit gene which is responsive to activators of the PKA and PKC signal transduction pathways.",M1
11555357,"Luteal deficiency and embryo mortality in the mare.Four separate components combine to produce the progesterone and biologically active 5 alpha-reduced pregnanes needed to maintain pregnancy in the mare. The primary corpus luteum (CL) is prolonged beyond its cyclical lifespan by the down-regulation of endometrial oxytocin receptors to prevent activation of the luteolytic pathway and its waning progesterone production is supplemented from day 40 of gestation by the formation of a series of accessory CL which develop in the maternal ovaries as a result of the gonadotrophic actions of pituitary FSH and the equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>). From around day 100 the allantochorion secretes progesterone and progestagens directly to the endometrium and underlying myometrium and, in the last month of gestation, the enlarging foetal adrenal gland secretes appreciable quantities of pregnenelone which is also utilized by the placenta to synthesize progestagens. Between 10 and 15% of mares undergo foetal death and abortion at some time in gestation and the majority of these losses occur during the first 40 days of gestation when the primary CL is the sole source of progesterone. Yet, all the available evidence suggests that untoward luteolysis is not common in this period and the losses that do occur have other underlying causes. Beyond day 40 the secondary CL receive powerful luteotrophic support from eCG and from day 80-100 until term the supply organ (placenta) and target tissues (endometrium and myometrium) are in direct contact with each other over their entire surface. In the face of this interlocking and failsafe system for progestagen production throughout pregnancy, and despite a paucity of evidence that a deficiency of progesterone production is a cause of pregnancy loss in the mare, it is surprising, and worrying, that annually many thousands of pregnant mares throughout the world are given exogenous progestagen therapy during part or all of their gestation as a form of preventative insurance against the possibility of pregnancy failure. Basic investigative research is required urgently to validate or debunk the practice.",M1
11524236,"Granulosa cells of the cumulus oophorus are different from mural granulosa cells in their response to gonadotrophins and IGF-I.There are two types of granulosa cells: those which surround the oocyte are cumulus cells (CC) and those which surround the antrum are mural granulosa cells (MGC). These cells are under the influence of several hormones and growth factors, the most important of which are gonadotrophins and IGF-I. In this article, we report novel observations on the differences between these two types of granulosa cells and their interaction with gonadotrophins and IGF-I. We were able to conduct physiological studies on the role of IGF-I by using an analogue of IGF-I which does not bind to IGF-I-binding proteins (LR3-IGF-I). Immature rats received saline, equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>), LR3-IGF-I or eCG plus LR3-IGF-I by infusion using a pump from 24-29 days of age. The rats were killed and the ovaries removed. Surface follicles were punctured and MGC and oocyte cumulus complexes were removed. These were cultured in saline (control) and in three different doses of FSH. Cell replication was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation and differentiation was evaluated by the measurement of progesterone secretion. It was noted that CC replicated ten times more than MGC. Similarly, progesterone secretion by CC was six times more than by MGC. In vivo exposure to gonadotrophins (eCG) positively influenced in vitro treatment with FSH in both cell types. This phenomenon was observed in both cell replication and progesterone secretion. The IGF-I analogue had a positive effect on cell replication of MGC but a negative effect on the cell replication of CC. With respect to progesterone secretion, the IGF-I analogue had a negative effect on CC but a positive effect on MGC. In conclusion, CC behaved differently from MGC in response to gonadotrophins and the IGF-I analogue. IGF-I and FSH acted additively, synergistically or antagonistically in different circumstances.",M1
11441919,"Dexamethasone increases inhibin and estradiol secretion mediated by endogenous FSH in equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>)-primed immature female rats.In the present study, we have examined whether the effects of dexamethasone on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion were mediated by hypophysiotropic factors, and whether the increased levels of FSH induced by dexamethasone can stimulate ovarian functions in equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-primed immature female rats. Dexamethasone (500 microg) significantly increased serum concentrations of FSH in hypophysectomized rats implanted with pituitary under the kidney capsule, as well as in intact rats. Serum concentrations of inhibin and estradiol in eCG (2.5, 5 i.u.)-primed rats were significantly increased by simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone (500 microg) and eCG. These simultaneous effects were not confirmed in hypophysectomized rats. The results had shown that hypophysiotropic factors do not mediate the selective increase of FSH secretion caused by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone induces the excess amount of FSH secretion from anterior pituitary and this FSH can stimulate inhibin and estradiol secretion in eCG-primed immature female rat.",M1
11431157,"Kallikrein gene expression in the gonadotrophin-stimulated rat ovary.The kallikreins (KLKs) are a highly conserved multi-gene family of serine proteases that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and act on a diverse range of substrates. KLK-like enzyme activity has variously been reported to increase or decrease during the period leading up to ovulation in the equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>)primed, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-stimulated immature rat ovary. These earlier studies, which used biochemical assays to detect enzyme activity, lacked the specificity and sensitivity necessary to characterise conclusively the activity of the individual KLK gene family members. In this study, we have used a gene-specific RT-PCR/Southern hybridisation strategy to delineate the expression patterns of six of the individual KLK genes expressed in the rat ovary (rKLK1-3 and rKLK7-9). We have identified three broad patterns of expression in the eCG/hCG-stimulated ovary in which there is either a post-eCG increase/pre-ovulatory decrease in rKLK expression (rKLK1, rKLK3), a peri-ovulatory decrease in expression (rKLK2, rKLK8) or a relatively unchanged pattern of expression (rKLK7, rKLK9). In addition to clarifying the earlier biochemical studies, these findings support a differential role for the individual KLKs in the ovulatory process.",M1
11390172,"Impaired ovulation by 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in immature rats treated with equine chorionic gonadotropin.Several studies have established that 2,3,7,8 tetrachloro-p-dioxin (TCDD) blocks ovulation. The main purpose of this study was to determine if induced ovulation was delayed temporarily by TCDD. The ovulation model used was that of the gonadotropin-primed intact or hypophysectomized rat. Immature intact female Sprague-Dawley rats (IIR) were given 32 microg TCDD/kg by gavage on day 24 of age. The next day equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) (5 IU) was injected sc to stimulate follicular development. The number of ova in the oviducts, the ovulation rate, and steroid concentrations were determined at 72, 96, 120, and 144 h after eCG. Immature female Sprague-Dawley rats (IHR) were hypophysectomized on day 23 of age. On day 26, the IHR were given 20 microg TCDD/kg by gavage. The next day eCG (10 IU) was injected sc to stimulate follicle development and at 52 h after eCG, 10 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was given to induce ovulation. The same parameters as in IIR were determined in IHR at 72, 96, and 120 h after eCG. TCDD decreased body and ovarian weight gains in both IIR and IHR. In IIR, TCDD delayed ovulation by 24 to 48 h reducing the number of ova shed as well as the number of animals ovulating at 72 and 96 h after eCG. In IHR, however, TCDD reduced only the number of ova shed but caused no delay in ovulation. The IIR treated with TCDD had low levels of progesterone (P4) at 72 and 96 h after eCG but high levels of estradiol (E2) at the same time points. This sustained high level of E2 production coincided with a transient decrease in serum concentrations of androstenedione (A4). The alteration of steroid hormones by TCDD was restored to normal by 48 h after ovulation in IIR. Serum P4 concentration was not altered by TCDD in IHR at 72 h after eCG but was decreased thereafter. The delay in ovulation induced by TCDD in IIR indicates the disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis during proestrus. The decrease in number of ova shed in IHR induced by exogenous gonadotropins indicates an additional direct ovarian effect of TCDD in blocking ovulation.",M1
11263818,"Intervals from norgestomet withdrawal and injection of equine chorionic gonadotropin or P.G. 600 to estrus and ovulation in ewes.Synchronization of estrus and ovulation is essential for AI of ewes during a predetermined time frame, and progestogen-<e>eCG</e> treatments are typically used to prepare the ewes. However, eCG is not readily available in the United States, but P.G. 600 (400 IU of eCG and 200 IU of hCG) is available. Thus, we conducted a study to determine the effects of eCG and P.G. 600 on the timing of estrus and ovulation after progestogen withdrawal. Ewes were assigned to two replicates of an experiment with the following treatments: 1) 3-mg norgestomet implant (i.e., one-half of a Syncro-Mate-B [SMB] implant) for 10 d, plus 2 mL of saline i.m. at SMB removal (n = 11); 2) 3-mg SMB implant for 10 d, plus 400 IU of eCG i.m. at SMB removal (n = 13); and 3) 3-mg SMB implant for 10 d, plus P.G. 600 i.m. at implant removal (n = 9). On d 6 after SMB insertion, PGF2alpha was used to induce luteolysis. Beginning 12 h after implant removal, vasectomized rams were used at 12-h intervals to check for estrus. When a ewe was detected in estrus, each ovary was evaluated ultrasonically. Ovaries were evaluated again 16 h later and then at 8-h intervals until ovulation. Treatment altered the interval from implant removal to estrus (less [P &lt; 0.05] in SMB + eCG than in the other two groups) and to ovulation (greatest [P &lt; 0.05] in SMB). However, the treatment x replicate interaction was significant for the intervals from implant removal to estrus (P &lt; 0.03) and from implant removal to ovulation (P &lt; 0.05). An inconsistent response in the SMB-treated ewes seemed to be primarily responsible for the interaction. The intervals to estrus and to ovulation for the SMB-treated ewes were shorter (P &lt; 0.05) in Replicate 1 than in Replicate 2. Also, both intervals seemed to be less consistent between replicates for the SMB + P.G. 600- than for the SMB + eCG-treated ewes; that is, eCG seemed to increase the predictability of the intervals to estrus and to ovulation. Neither the main effects of treatment and replicate nor their interaction were significant for the interval from estrus to ovulation (38.4 /- 3.3 h), size of the ovulatory follicle (7.7 +/- 0.8 mm), or ovulation rate (1.6 +/- 0.2). We concluded from this experiment that eCG is a better choice than P.G. 600 as the gonadotropin to use at the time of progestogen withdrawal to prepare ewes for AI during a predetermined interval.",M1
11233784,"Effects of brief postponement of the preovulatory LH surge on ovulation rates and embryo formation in <e>eCG</e>/prostaglandin-treated heifers.The aim of this study was to investigate whether prolongation of the period of preovulatory follicular development after superovulation reduces heterogeneity of oocytes of stimulated follicles with respect to the potential to mature, to ovulate, to be fertilized and to develop into embryos. Heifers were treated with eCG on Day 10 and prostaglandin (PG) 48 h later. At the time of eCG administration some of the heifers received a norgestomet implant (N) to suppress the LH surge. After 96 to 104 h, N was removed and an LH surge was induced with GnRH (G) (N/G); the other animals served as controls. Matured oocytes (Experiment A: n=9, 139 [N/G] and 11, 125 [Control] heifers, oocytes), zygotes and oviducts (Experiment B: n=8, 44 [N/G] and 9, 72 [Control] heifers, zygotes) and embryos (Experiment C: n=11, 205 [N/G] and 11, 165 [Control] heifers, embryos) were collected at 22 to 26 h, 38 to 52 h and 7 days after the LH surge, respectively. Hatched blastocyst formation of matured oocytes (Experiment A) was analyzed after 11 days of IVC after IVF. In vivo fertilization rate of zygotes, the presence of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive granules in the oviduct (Experiment B) and stage of development of embryos (Experiment C) were analyzed stereomicroscopically. The mean interval between PG and the LH surge was 53.8+/-3 (SD) (N/G) vs. 42.4+/-4 h (Control). The maximum peripheral estradiol-17beta concentration (529+/-36 [SEM] [N/G] vs. 403+/-17 pmol/L [Control]) and the response to superovulation (25.4+/-2 [N/G] vs. 18.7+/-2 [Control]) were higher in N/G than in Control heifers. Hatched blastocyst formation rate (37.4 [N/G] vs. 33.6% [Control]), in vivo fertilization rate (69.0+/-14 [N/G] vs. 73.0+/-10% [Control]) and the yield of total embryos (3.8+/-1 [N/G] vs. 5.6+/-2 [Control]) did not differ between groups. The percentage of heifers with abundant PAS-positive granules in the distal ampulla (0 [N/G] vs. 31% [Control]) was reduced after N/G treatment. Prolongation of the period of preovulatory follicular development increased the number of mature follicles and ovulations but did not result in higher embryo yield, possibly because of an impaired oviductal environment.",M1
11138728,"Dexamethasone or triamcinolone increases follicular development in immature female rats.We have previously reported that dexamethasone increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion via suppression of inhibin in immature female rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone or triamcinolone on follicular development and ovarian functions (estradiol and inhibin secretion) in equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>)-primed immature female rats. Dexamethasone significantly increased the number of ovulated oocytes in immature female rats treated with 5 i.u. eCG. Serum concentration of FSH in eCG-treated female rats was increased by administration of dexamethasone or triamcinolone, showing the peak value at 9 h after its administration, although the levels of inhibin markedly decreased at that time. Serum concentrations of inhibin and estradiol in eCG-treated female rats increased at 24 h after administration of dexamethasone or triamcinolone. These results demonstrate that dexamethasone or triamcinolone increases FSH secretion, and the excess amount of FSH strongly stimulates follicular development cooperating with exogenous eCG.",M1
11018759,"Expression of an in vitro biologically active equine LH/CG without C-terminal peptide (CTP) and/or beta26-110 disulphide bridge.The C-terminal region of the beta subunit of the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is implied in heterodimer stability (beta26-110 disulphide bridge), in vitro LH bioactivity (region beta102-110) and in in vivo LH bioactivity (beta CTP). Like the hCG beta, the equine eLH and <e>eCG</e> beta subunits, also possess a C-terminal extension (CTP). But, in contrast to hCG, eLH and eCG bind to both LH and FSH receptors in species other than the horse. This allows investigation of the roles of the beta subunit C-terminal region of a eLH/CG recombinant molecule on both LH and FSH activities. To do so, the CTP was deleted and/or the beta26-110 disulphide bond was mutated and the resulting mutated beta subunits were transiently co-expressed with common alpha subunit in COS7 cells. These regions were also deleted in a betaalphaeLH/CG single chain also expressed in COS7 cells. The hormones produced were characterized by different ELISAs and in vitro LH and FSH bioassays. Mutation of the 26-110 disulphide bond and deletion of the betaCTP led to a decrease in eLH/CG heterodimer production. Double mutation promoted an additive effect on production of the heterodimer and of the corresponding tethered eLH/CG. The elimination of the beta26-110 disulphide bond in the betaalpha single chain had no effect on its production. However, neither the 26-110 disulphide bond nor the CTP mutations affected dimer stability and bioactivities of the secreted heterodimers and/or single chain molecules. Therefore, in contrast to hCG, the 26-110 S-S bond of the recombinant eLH/CG beta subunit does not seem to be essential for eLH/CG dimer stability upon secretion and expressing LH and FSH bioactivities.",M1
10952932,"Vascular endothelial growth factor production in growing pig antral follicles.Angiogenesis is the process that drives blood vessel development in growing tissues in response to the local production of angiogenic factors. With the present research the authors have studied vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in ovarian follicles as a potential mechanism of ovarian activity regulation. Prepubertal gilts were treated with 1250 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) followed 60 h later by 750 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in order to induce follicle growth and ovulation. Ovaries were collected at different times of the treatment and single follicles were isolated and classified according to their diameter as small (&lt;4 mm), medium (4-5 mm), or large (&gt;5 mm). VEGF levels were measured in follicular fluid by enzyme immunoassay, and VEGF mRNA content was evaluated in isolated theca and granulosa compartments. Equine chorionic gonadotropin stimulated a prompt follicular growth and induced a parallel evident rise in VEGF levels in follicular fluid of medium and large follicles. Analysis of VEGF mRNA levels confirmed the stimulatory effect of eCG, showing that it is confined to granulosa cells, whereas theca cells maintained their VEGF steady state mRNA. Administration of hCG 60 h after eCG caused a dramatic drop in follicular fluid VEGF that reached undetectable levels in 36 h. A parallel reduction in VEGF mRNA expression was recorded in granulosa cells. The stimulating effect of eCG was also confirmed by in vitro experiments, provided that follicles in toto were used, whereas isolated follicle cells did not respond to this hormonal stimulation. Consistent with the observation in vivo, granulosa cells in culture reacted to hCG with a clear block of VEGF production. These results demonstrate that while follicles of untreated animals produce stable and low levels of the angiogenic factor, VEGF markedly rose in medium and large follicles after eCG administration. The increasing levels, essentially attributable to granulosa cells, are likely to be involved in blood vessel development in the wall of growing follicles, and may play a local key role in gonadotropin-induced follicle development. When ovulation approaches, under the effect of hCG, the production of VEGF is switched off, probably creating the safest conditions for the rupture of the follicle wall while theca cells maintained unaltered angiogenic activity, which is probably required for corpus luteum development.",M1
10864830,"Improvement of follicular development rather than gonadotrophin secretion by thyroxine treatment in infertile immature hypothyroid rdw rats.Despite extensive study of reproductive abnormalities in female hypothyroid animals, little is known of folliculogenesis and gonadotrophin secretion in spontaneously hypothyroid animals, especially in response to exogenous hormone treatment. In this study, follicular development and plasma hormone concentrations in the presence or absence of thyroxine and <e>eCG</e> treatment were investigated in infertile immature spontaneously hypothyroid rdw rats. Administration of thyroxine once a day from day 21 to day 29 after birth resulted in increases in body weight (P &lt; 0.001) and ovary mass on day 30 (P &lt; 0.01). Similar populations of both healthy and atretic antral follicles ranging from 101 to 400 micrometer in diameter were observed in control rdw and normal rats. In rdw rats, thyroxine treatment markedly increased the number of healthy antral uniovular follicles 101-400 or &gt; 550 micrometer in diameter in the absence or presence of eCG, respectively. Combined treatment of thyroxine and eCG in rdw rats also markedly increased the number of healthy antral biovular follicles. Thyroxine treatment did not affect the population of atretic antral follicles, but resulted in decrease in the number of atretic large antral follicles (&gt; 400 microm) in the presence of eCG. Plasma oestradiol concentrations in rdw rats given both thyroxine and eCG were significantly higher than they were in rdw rats given eCG alone (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in plasma FSH concentrations on day 28 between rdw (10.7 +/- 1.6 ng ml(-1)) and normal rats (12.0 +/- 1.4 ng ml(-1); P &gt; 0. 05). Although there were no significant differences in plasma LH concentrations between control rdw (1.9 +/- 0.1 ng ml(-1)) and normal rats on day 30 (1.8 +/- 0.1 ng ml(-1); P &gt; 0.05), eCG treatment increased plasma LH to a peak concentration 52 h after injection in normal (24.9 +/- 2.4 ng ml(-1)) but not in rdw rats treated with thyroxine (4.8 +/- 0.3 ng ml(-1); P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that thyroxine treatment improves follicular development but does not rescue the defect of the preovulatory surge of LH in eCG-primed rdw rats.",M1
10864829,"Detection of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in equine ovaries.A steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein has been identified in several species as a probable important rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. This protein is believed to be responsible for transporting cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is known that equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>) stimulates steroidogenesis in the corpora lutea of early pregnant mares and that eCG also upregulates StAR mRNA in bovine ovaries. In the present study, ovarian tissue from cyclic and early pregnant mares was immunostained to detect the distribution of the StAR protein. Western blot analysis was performed, followed by phosphor imaging to establish whether the onset of eCG secretion in pregnancy was associated with increased expression of the StAR protein. Immunostaining for StAR was confined to the theca interna of growing and preovulatory follicles, but 24 h after treatment with hCG, some granulosa cells were positively stained. Positive staining was confined to the large luteal cells of the equine corpus luteum. There was no difference in the distribution of immunostaining before or after onset of eCG secretion in pregnant mares, but increased amounts of StAR were detected in corpora lutea from mares at day 40 or day 41 of pregnancy compared with non-pregnant mares and mares at days 20-30 of pregnancy.",M1
10864826,"Effect of administration of <e>eCG</e> to postpartum cows on folliculogenesis in the ovary ipsilateral to the previously gravid uterine horn and uterine involution.This study tested the hypothesis that increased oestradiol secretion by large follicles in the ovary ipsilateral to the previously gravid uterine horn has a local effect to increase the rate of uterine involution. Cows were administered an i.m. water placebo (n = 19), 250 iu equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) (n = 18) or 750 iu eCG (n = 20) 14 days post partum (day 0). Transrectal ultrasonography at the time of treatment and 2, 4 and 6 days later monitored uterine horn diameter and ovarian structures. Blood samples collected contemporaneously were assayed for 15-keto-13, 14-dihydro-prostaglandin F(2alpha) and oestradiol concentration. For control cows, accumulated diameter of the largest follicle in the ovary ipsilateral to the previously gravid uterine horn, compared with the contralateral ovary, was smaller on day 0 (P &lt; 0.05) and days 2, 4 and 6 (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in the eCG-treated animals. There were 12, 8 and 11 cows with a plasma oestradiol concentration &lt; 1 pg ml(-1) on day 0 in the control, 250 and 750 iu eCG treatment groups, respectively. For control cows, the peripheral oestradiol concentrations were higher on day 6 compared with days 0, 2 and 4 (P &lt; 0.05); for cows treated with 250 iu eCG, concentrations were higher on days 4 and 6 compared with day 0 (P &lt; 0.05); and for cows treated with 750 iu eCG, concentrations were higher on days 2 and 4 compared with day 0 (P &lt; 0.01). Treatment with eCG, or the presence of a follicle &gt; 8 mm in diameter in the ovary ipsilateral to the previously gravid uterine horn, did not affect the rate of uterine involution or plasma 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-prostaglandin F(2alpha) concentration. In conclusion, administration of eCG to increase follicular growth and oestradiol production overcame the inhibition of follicular growth in the ovary ipsilateral to the previously gravid uterine horn, but did not affect uterine involution.",M1
10864803,"E-cadherin-catenin complex in the rat ovary: cell-specific expression during folliculogenesis and luteal formation.The cadherins and their cytoplasmic counterparts, the catenins, form the adherens junctions, which are of importance for tissue integrity and barrier functions. The development and maturation of the ovarian follicle is characterized by structural changes, which require altered expression or function of the components involved in cell-cell contacts. The present study examined the cell-specific localization and temporal expression of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) and alpha- and beta-catenin during follicular development, ovulation and corpus luteum formation in the immature gonadotrophin- and oestrogen-stimulated rat ovary. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting demonstrated the expression of E-cadherin in theca and interstitial cells of immature ovaries before and after injection of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<e>eCG</e>). E-cadherin was not detected in granulosa cells, except in the preantral follicles located to the inner region of the ovary. The content of E-cadherin in theca and interstitial cells decreased after an ovulatory dose of hCG. Granulosa cells of apoptotic follicles did not express E-cadherin. Oestrogen treatment (diethylstilboestrol) of immature rats for up to 3 days did not result in a measurable expression of E-cadherin in granulosa cells. alpha- and beta-catenin were expressed in all ovarian compartments. The concentration of beta-catenin was constant during the follicular phase, whereas the content of alpha-catenin decreased in granulosa cells after treatment with diethylstilboestrol or hCG. The expression of alpha-catenin was also reduced in theca and interstitial cells after hCG. alpha- and beta-catenin were present in most ovarian cells at all stages of folliculogenesis. Therefore, the catenins have the potential to associate with different members of the cadherin family and to participate in the regulation of cytoskeletal structures and intracellular signalling. The restricted expression of E-cadherin in granulosa cells of preantral follicles indicates a role in the recruitment of these follicles to subsequent cycles. The specific decrease of alpha-catenin in granulosa cells and the reduction of both alpha-catenin and E-cadherin in theca cells of ovulatory follicles might reflect some of the molecular changes in cell-cell adhesion associated with ovulation and luteinization.",M1
10855689,"Novel studies on influence of gonadotropins and insulin-like growth factor-I on growth of cumulus oophorus in the rat.In the final developmental stage of a Graafian follicle, there are two functionally distinct types of granulosa cells: the cumulus cells (CCs) and the mural granulosa cells (MGCs). Previous studies focused on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) interactions in MGCs. Our goal was to study these interactions in CC proliferation. Immature rats received in vivo treatments of either saline, equine chorionic gonadotropin (<e>eCG</e>) with high FSH activity, an IGF-I analog (LR3-IGF-I) with poor binding to IGF-I binding proteins, or a combination of both hormones. CCs from each in vivo treatment were then cultured and treated in vitro with either saline, FSH, or IGF-I. CCs proliferation were assessed by measurement of 3H-thymidine incorporation. Prior in vivo treatment with eCG resulted in the highest proliferative activity of CCs when combined with FSH in vitro treatment. In vivo treatment with LR3-IGF-I had no effect on CC replication. CC replication was higher in FSH in vitro treatment than of IGF-I. The combination of eCG and LR3-IGF-I was the only in vivo treatment to stimulate higher CC proliferation with IGF-I in vitro treatment. This study suggests that FSH does not act through IGF-I, a mechanism previously proposed.",M1
10798484,"Effect of superovulation induction on embryonic development on day 5 and subsequent development and survival after nonsurgical embryo transfer in pigs.To evaluate the effects of <e>eCG</e> dosage on recovery and quality of Day 5 embryos and on subsequent development and survival after embryo transfer, batches of 5 to 10 donor sows were treated with 1000 or 1500 IU eCG. Recipients from the same batch were synchronously treated with 800 IU eCG. Ovulation was induced with 750 IU hCG (72 h after eCG) in donors and recipients. Donors were inseminated and embryos were collected at 162 h after hCG (120 h after ovulation). Ovulation rate was lower using 1000 IU eCG (28.5+/-11.7; n=48) than 1500 IU eCG (45.7+/-20.3; n=32; P&lt;0.0001). Embryo recovery rate (82.9+/-16.9%) and percentage expanded blastocysts (56.2+/-31.4%) were similar (P&gt;0.05). Expanded blastocysts from each group of sows were pooled into 2 groups within eCG treatment, containing embryos from normally ovulating sows (&lt; or = 25 corpora lutea [CL]) or from superovulated sows (&gt; 25 CL). Average diameter and number of cells of a random sample of the expanded blastocysts per pool were recorded. The average diameter of blastocysts (160.5+/-11.5 microm) was not affected by eCG dosage or ovulation rate (P&gt;0.10). The average number of cells per embryo was higher in the 1000 IU eCG group (84.3+/-15.3) than in the 1500 IU eCG group (70.2+/-1.9; P&lt;0.05) but was similar for normal and superovulated donors within each eCG group (P&gt;0.10). Of the 4 groups, litters of 28 to 30 blastocysts were nonsurgically transferred to 27 synchronous recipients. Pregnant recipients were slaughtered on Day 37 after hCG treatment to evaluate embryonic development and survival. Pregnancy rate for the 1000 and 1500 IU eCG donor groups was 71% (10/14) and 46% (6/13; P&gt;0.10), respectively. The number of implantations and fetuses for the 1000 IU eCG groups was 12.9+/-3.0 and 11.1+/-2.7, and 14.2+/-7.0 and 10.5+/-4.6, respectively, for the 1500 IU eCG groups (P&gt;0.10). After post-priory categorizing the litters of blastocysts to below or above the average diameter (158 microm) of the transferred embryos, irrespective of eCG dosage or ovulation rate, the pregnancy rate was 43% (6/14) and 77% (10/13; P&lt;0.10), respectively. Post-priory categorizing the transferred litters to below or above the average number of cells per embryo litter, irrespective of eCG dosage or ovulation rate, showed no differences in pregnancy rates or number of implantations and fetuses (P&gt;0.10). It was concluded that eCG dosage affects embryonic development at Day 7 after hCG, and this effect was not due to ovulation rate. Embryonic survival after nonsurgical transfer was not related to eCG dosage but tended to be related to the diameter of the blastocysts.",M1

Serum samples for cardiac troponin T (cTnT), creatine kinase-MB isozyme (CK-MB), myoglobin, and H-FABP were obtained from 64 patients with AMI and 53 patients with other conditions (control group). H-FABP was measured by using 2 immunoassays, the H-FABP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Biocheck, Foster City, CA) and the H-FABP latex turbidimetric immunoassay (LTIA; HBI, Anyang, Korea). Sensitivities of assays for cTnT, CK-MB, myoglobin, H-FABP (by ELISA), H-FABP (by LTIA), and electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) for the diagnosis of AMI at hospital admission were 39.1%, 59.4%, 64.1%, 68.7%, 70.3%, and 54.7%, respectively. Specificities of cTnT, CK-MB, myoglobin, H-FABP (by ELISA), H-FABP (by LTIA), and ECG were 98.1%, 71.7%, 81.1%, 77.4%, 90.6%, and 92.5%, respectively. The automated H-FABP (by LTIA) is superior to cTnT, CK-MB, myoglobin, and H-FABP (by ELISA) tests for the diagnosis of AMI in patients admitted within 4 hours from the onset of chest pain.",M2
20548974,"Electrocardiographic identification of the culprit coronary artery in inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Electrocardiograms (<e>ECGs</e>) are essential in identifying the type and location of acute myocardial infarction. In the setting of inferior wall myocardial infarction (IWMI), identification of the right coronary artery (RCA) as the culprit artery is important because of the potential complications associated with its involvement. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate previous ECG criteria used for the identification of RCA involvement and validate them in the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ASSENT 4 PCI) cohort; and to develop an improved simplified score to identify RCA involvement.METHODS: ASSENT 4 PCI patients with IWMI (n=710) were included in the present study. A literature review was conducted to identify previously published criteria to detect RCA involvement. Logistic regression was used to develop a new simplified algorithm for identifying RCA involvement.RESULTS: The sensitivities and specificities of six previous ECG criteria were substantially lower when applied to the ASSENT 4 PCI population. A new algorithm found that ST segment depression in leads I, aVL and V6, and ST segment elevation of greater than 1 mm in lead aVF was associated with a higher likelihood of RCA involvement, and any ST segment depression in V1 and V3 was associated with a lower likelihood of RCA involvement. A simplified risk score found a prevalence of RCA involvement of over 90% among patients with scores of greater than two.CONCLUSIONS: The ECG is useful in identifying RCA involvement in IWMI before angiography. Previously published criteria appear to be inadequate, and the simple algorithm presented in the current study may be a useful tool in identifying RCA involvement at the bedside.",M2

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Prospective, single-centre study conducted in a referral centre enrolling 100 patients with low-to-intermediate risk and suspicion of coronary artery disease. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced, 128-slice, dual-source CT coronary angiography and CA. Patients were randomly assigned to two different low-dose CT protocols (each 100 kV/320 mA): in group A (n=50), CT was performed using the prospectively electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>)-gated step-and-shoot (SAS) mode; in group B (n=50), CT was performed using the prospectively ECG-gated high-pitch mode (pitch 3.4). The image quality and presence or absence of significant coronary stenosis in all coronary segments were evaluated by two blinded and independent observers. CA served as the standard of reference. RESULTS: Sixty-one significant stenoses were found in group A, and 69 in group B. There was no significant difference in age (group A, 62+/-8 yrs; group B, 63+/-8 yrs; p=0.72), body mass index (group A, 26.4+/-3.1 kg/m2; group B, 25.9+/-2.8 kg/m2; p=0.41) and heart rate (HR) (group A, 58+/-8 bpm; group B, 56+/-10 bpm; p=0.66) between the groups. Diagnostic image quality was obtained in 98.6% (651/660) of segments in group A and in 98.9% (642/649) in group B, with no significant differences between groups. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 94%, 91%, 85% and 97% per-patient in group A, and 93%, 94%, 89% and 97% per-patient in group B (no significant differences). The effective radiation dose in group B (0.9+/-0.1 mSv) was significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower than that in group A (1.4+/-0.4 mSv). CONCLUSIONS: Both the high-pitch and the SAS mode for low-dose CT coronary angiography provide high accuracy for the assessment of significant coronary stenoses, while the high-pitch mode further significantly lowers the radiation dose.",M2

METHODS: This study included 561 consecutive patients who underwent a successful prospective <e>ECG</e>-gating CTCA protocol (low-dose group) 64-slice CTCA and 188 patients who underwent retrospective ECG-gating CTCA with ECG-triggered dose modulation CTCA (high-dose group). LAR was computed, given the organ equivalent dose, for all cancers in both sexes. LAR was tabulated for each decile of dose-length product by 10-year age classes, separately for each sex. RESULTS: Estimates of LAR of any cancer for an exposure at age &lt; or =40 year were lower in males than in females for any given quantile. At age &gt;/ or =50 years, LAR was similar between sexes only at the lowest exposure doses, whereas at higher dosage, it was, in general, higher for women. At the median age of this case series (62 years) and for a radiation exposure ranging from 1.33 to 3.81 mSv, LAR was 1 in 4329 (or 23.1 per 10(5) persons exposed) and 1 in 4629 (or 21.6 per 10(5) persons) in men and women, respectively. For an exposure ranging from 10.34 to 18.97 mSv at the same median age, the LAR of cancer incidence was 1 in 1336 (or 74.8 per 10(5) persons) in men and doubled (1 in 614 or 162.8 per 10(5) persons) in women. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided an estimate of the LAR of cancer in middle-aged patients of both sexes after a single diagnostic CTCA, providing an easy-to-read table.",M2

INVESTIGATIONS: The <e>ECG</e> revealed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography showed severe decreased left ventricular function. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed the severe reduced left ventricular function with a two graded mitral regurgitation as well as a pronounced late enhancement in the posterobasal area of the interventricular septum. Cardiac catheterisation showed mild diffuse atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries without stenotic lesions. Multiple myocardial biopsies of the right ventricle revealed extensive remodelling processes with focal fibrosis in presence of mononuclear cell infiltrates, T-wave alternans and the heart rate variability were positive. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) with severe reduced left ventriucular function was diagnosed. After successful electrical cardioversion and initiation of a sufficient heart failure treatment, the clinical symptoms as well as left ventricular function improved significantly. CONCLUSION: Risk stratification of sudden cardiac death remains a clinical challenge especially in NICM. Significantly predictors in ischaemic cardiomyopathy, such as heart rate turbulance (HRT) and T-wave alternans, are not useful or have no importance in NICM. However, the prognosis does not correlate with restricted left ventricular function in NICM. Cardiac MRI or marker of autonomic dysfunction could be helpful in risk stratification. How far late enhancement is a surrogate parameter or the real substrate for life threatening arrhythmias is still unclear. Non-invasive risk stratification could be helpful in borderline decisions, however, it should not be taken mandatory. Close-meshed control intervals of the clinical status under optimal medication are recommended, followed by a implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if needed. ICD implantation is superior to medical treatment in persistent depressed left ventricular function. The ideal time for ICD implantation in newly diagnosed NICM remains unclear at the moment.",M2

20501728,"Performance of simultaneous cardiac-respiratory self-gated three-dimensional MR imaging of the heart: initial experience.This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all volunteers and patients. The objective of the present study was to assess the performance of high-spatial-resolution three-dimensional prospective cardiac-respiratory self-gated (CRSG) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for determining left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass, as well as right ventricular (RV) volumes, in comparison with standard electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>)-triggered, two-dimensional multisection, multiple-breath-hold cine imaging. The self-gated method derives cardiac triggering and respiratory gating information prospectively on the basis of additional MR imaging signals acquired in every repetition time and, thereby, eliminates the need for ECG triggering and multiple-breath-hold procedures. Data were acquired in 15 healthy volunteers (mean age, 27.2 years +/- 7.2 [standard deviation]) and 11 patients (mean age, 60.7 years +/- 11.3). The bias between the self-gating and the reference imaging techniques was minimal for all LV and RV parameters (mean values: LV end-diastolic volume, 2.0 mL; LV end-systolic volume, 0.6 mL; RV end-diastolic volume, 2.2 mL; and RV end-systolic volume, 0.8 mL). Prospective CRSG is a valuable alternative to ECG-triggered, multisection, multiple-breath-hold cine imaging of the heart and holds considerable promise for simplifying functional imaging of the heart, particularly in patients who are unable to hold their breath for a long period and patients who show ECG signal disturbances.",M2

The aim of this study was to determine the possibilities of two differently acquired FISP (Fast Imaging with Steady State Precession) 2D MR sequences in the estimation of the pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow intensity through the normal cerebral aqueduct. METHODS: Sixty eight volunteers underwent brain MRI on 1.5T MR imager with additionally performed <e>ECG</e> retrospectively gated FISP 2D sequences (first one, as the part of the standard software package, with following technical parameters: TR 40, TE 12, FA 17, Matrix: 192 x 256, Acq 1, and the second one, experimentally developed by our investigation team: TR 30, TE 12, FA 70, Matrix: 192 x 256, Acq 1) respectively at two fixed slice positions--midsagittal and perpendicular to cerebral aqueduct, displayed and evaluated by multiplegated images in a closed-loop cinematographic (CINE) format. RESULTS: Normal brain morphology with preserved patency of the cerebral aqueduct in all of 68 healthy volunteers was demonstrated on MRI examination. Cerebrospinal fluid flow within the cerebral aqueduct was distinguishable on both CINE MRI studies in midsagittal plane, but the estimation of intraaqueductal CSF flow in perpendicular plane was possible on CINE MRI studies acquired with experimentally improved FISP 2D (TR 30, FA 70) sequence only.

20489088,"Comparison of sequential and helical scanning for radiation dose and image quality: results of the Prospective Multicenter Study on Radiation Dose Estimates of Cardiac CT Angiography (PROTECTION) I Study.OBJECTIVE: Concerns have been raised about the radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CTA). Recently, a prospective <e>ECG</e>-triggered sequential coronary CTA technique was developed to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the impact of a sequential scanning technique on image quality and radiation dose in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the Prospective Multicenter Study on Radiation Dose Estimates of Cardiac CT Angiography I (PROTECTION I) Study when compared with a standard helical scanning technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis comprises 685 64-MDCT coronary angiography studies of 47 international study sites in which the image quality was assessed by an experienced coronary CTA investigator using a 4-point score (1 = nondiagnostic, 4 = excellent image quality). Image quality was analyzed in all patients studied with the sequential scanning mode (n = 99) and in randomly selected patients of the population studied with the helical acquisition mode (n = 586). Radiation dose estimates were derived from the dose-length product (DLP) and a conversion coefficient for the chest (0.014 mSv x mGy(-1) x cm(-1)). RESULTS: Although the sequential scanning mode significantly reduced radiation dose estimates by 68% from 11.2 mSv for the helical mode to 3.6 mSv for the sequential mode (p &lt; 0.001), the median diagnostic image quality scores were comparable in both groups. The median diagnostic score for both scanning modes was 3.5 (interquartile range: sequential vs helical mode, 3.25-3.75 vs 3.0-3.75, respectively; p = 0.62). CONCLUSION: The results of the PROTECTION I Study suggest that the prospective ECG-triggered sequential coronary CTA technique significantly reduces radiation dose without impairing image quality when compared with the standard retrospective helical data acquisition in patients with a low and stable heart rate.",M2
20486583,"[Intraoperative coronary spasm during caesarean section under spinal anesthesia]A 37-year-old woman without history of ischemic heart disease or any coronary risk factors was scheduled for caesarean section. Under spinal anesthesia, the patient's blood pressure (BP) decreased to 93/72 mmHg. Although 6 mg of ephedrine was administered intravenously, BP continued to decrease to 75/40 mmHg and she complained of nausea. In addition to additional ephedrine (12 mg), phenylephrine (0.1 mg) and atropine (0.5 mg) were administered. BP increased to 170/100 mmHg, but electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) showed ST elevation in I and aV(L), ST depression in II, III, aV(F), and frequent premature ventricular beats, and the patient complained of chest discomfort. Coronary dilators and lidocaine promptly reversed the ST elevation, premature ventricular beats and discomfort. The operation was started promptly and was uneventful. Although BP decreased again to 75/45 mmHg at the beginning of the operation, we did not use vasopressors to avoid the relapse of myocardial ischemia. The anesthetic course was uneventful thereafter. This cardiac event seemed to be derived from coronary spasm caused by acute sympathetic stimulation. The observations in this case suggest that the possibility of intraoperative coronary spasm should be considered even in a healthy patient.",M2

20469806,"Heritability of abnormalities in cardiopulmonary coupling in sleep apnea: use of an electrocardiogram-based technique.RATIONALE: Studies of the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea may be facilitated by identifying intermediate traits with high heritability that quantify etiological pathways, such as those related to respiratory control. Electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>)-based sleep spectrograms, measuring the coupling between respiratory modulation of ECG QRS-wave amplitude and heart rate variability, may provide measures of sleep state and ventilatory dynamics during sleep. We evaluated the familial aggregation of distinctive spectrographic biomarkers of unstable sleep, related to elevated-low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC), to assess their utility in genetic studies. METHODS: 622 participants from 137 families from the Cleveland Family Study underwent standardized polysomnography (PSG). From the ECG signal on the PSG, the interbeat interval time series and the corresponding ECG-derived respiratory signal were extracted, and the low frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) component of their coupling was computed using a fully automated method. Narrow sense heritability of e-LFC was calculated using variance component methods. RESULTS: A spectral marker of abnormal low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC) demonstrated moderate correlation with apnea hypopnea index (AHI; r = 0.35, P &lt; 0.0001). The heritability estimate for e-LFC, after adjusting for age and sex was 0.32 (P &lt; 10-5) and remained unchanged after additionally adjusting for body mass index or AHI. In biological relatives of those with sleep apnea, a related marker of e-LFC was more prevalent than in controls (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30% of the variability of e-LFC, measured from a continuous ECG during sleep, is explained by familial factors other than BMI. ECG-based spectrographic measures of cardiopulmonary coupling may provide novel phenotypes for characterizing subgroups of individuals with different propensities and genetic etiologies for sleep apnea or for other conditions associated with sleep fragmentation.",M2

20458826,"Cardiopulmonary involvement in Fabry's disease.BACKGROUND: Fabry's disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity. Decreased enzyme activity leads to accumulation of glycosphingolipid in different tissues, including endothelial and smooth-muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVES: There is controversial data on cardiopulmonary involvement in Fabry's disease, because many reports are based on small and selected populations with Fabry's disease. Furthermore, the aetiology of cardiopulmonary symptoms in Fabry's disease is poorly understood. METHODS: We studied cardiopulmonary involvement in seventeen patients with Fabry's disease (20-65 years, 6 men) using <e>ECG</e>, bicycle stress, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry, diffusing capacity and pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) tests. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were compared to observed parameters in cardiopulmonary tests. RESULTS: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and reduced exercise capacity are the most apparent cardiac changes in both genders with Fabry's disease. ECG parameters were normal when excluding changes related to LVH. Spirometry showed mild reduction in vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV I), and mean values in diffusing capacity tests were within normal limits. Generally, only slight morphological pulmonary changes were detected using pulmonary HRCT, and they were not associated with changes in pulmonary function. The self-reported amount of pulmonary symptoms associated only with lower ejection fraction (P &lt; 0.001) and longer QRS-duration (P = 0.04) of all measured cardiopulmonary parameters, whereas cardiac symptoms have no statistically significant association with any of these parameters. CONCLUSION: LVH and reduced exercise capacity are the most apparent cardiopulmonary changes in Fabry's disease but they have only a minor association to cardiopulmonary symptoms.Therefore, routine cardiopulmonary evaluation in Fabry's disease using echocardiography is maybe enough when integrated to counselling for aerobic exercise training.",M2

METHODS: One hundred and ten ECGs with paroxysmal narrow QRS complex, short RP tachycardia were evaluated. Subjects with overt ventricular pre-excitation during sinus rhythm were excluded from the study. The mechanism of arrhythmia was established during the electrophysiological study and confirmed by the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 74 displayed common type AVNRT and 36 AVRT. Predictors of AVNRT were the presence of pseudo r'-waves in lead V1 [sensitivity 39.19%; specificity 97.14%; positive predictive value (PPV) 96.67%; negative predictive value (NPV) 43.04%] and pseudo S-waves in inferior leads (sensitivity 28.38%; specificity 94.29%; PPV 91.30%; NPV 38.37%). In the setting of visible P-waves, an RP interval &lt; or =90 ms favoured the diagnosis of AVNRT (sensitivity 57.14%; specificity 80.65%). Predictors of AVRT were QRS alternans (sensitivity 50%; specificity 89.19%; PPV 69.23%; NPV 78.57%) as well as ST-segment alterations during tachycardia. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ST-segment depression for discriminating AVRT from AVNRT were 97.22%, 58.11%, 53.03%, 97.73%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ST-segment elevation in lead aVR were 94.44%, 58.11%, 52.31%, and 95.56%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ST-segment depression [(odds ratio (OR): 12.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.77-90.81, P = 0.011)] and QRS alternans (OR: 9.43, 95% CI: 1.38-64.37, P = 0.022) displayed the highest predictive ability favouring the diagnosis of AVRT.

20458005,"Greater orthostatic tolerance in young black compared with white women.We hypothesized that orthostatic tolerance is higher in young, healthy black compared with white women. To determine orthostatic tolerance, 22 women (11 black and 11 white) underwent graded lower body negative pressure to presyncope. We measured blood pressure, heart rate, and R-R interval (<e>ECG</e>) continuously at baseline and through all of the levels of lower body negative pressure. Blood samples were taken at baseline along with presyncope for the measurement of plasma catecholamine concentrations, serum aldosterone concentration, and plasma renin activity. Cumulative stress index, the sum of the product of time and lower body negative pressure, was the indicator of orthostatic tolerance. Orthostatic tolerance in the black women was greater than in the white women [cumulative stress index: -1003 (375) versus -476 (197); P&lt;0.05]. Although plasma concentrations of norepinephrine increased in both groups at presyncope, the increase was greater in black [Deltaplasma concentrations of norepinephrine: 167 (123)] versus white women [86 (64); P&lt;0.05], as was the increase in PRA [DeltaPRA 2.6 (1.0) versus 0.6 (0.9) ng of angiotensin II x mL(-1) x h(-1); P&lt;0.05, for black and white women, respectively). Although heart rate increased and R-R interval decreased to a greater extent during lower body negative pressure in black women compared with white women (ANOVA: P&lt;0.05), baroreflex function (ie, slope R-R interval versus systolic blood pressure) was unaffected by race. These data indicate that orthostatic tolerance is greater in black compared with white women, which appears to be a function of greater sympathetic nervous system responses to orthostatic challenges.",M2

We estimated the prognostic value of FPAPP-A vs total PAPP-A (TPAPP-A) concentrations in forecasting death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (combined endpoint) in patients with non-ST-elevation ACS. METHODS: We recruited 267 patients hospitalized for symptoms consistent with non-ST-elevation ACS and followed them for 12 months. FPAPP-A, TPAPP-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured at admission; cTnI was also measured at 6-12 h and 24 h. Because of the recently shown interaction between PAPP-A and heparin, we excluded patients treated with any heparin preparations before the admission blood sampling. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 57 (21.3%) patients met the endpoint (22 deaths and 35 nonfatal myocardial infarctions). According to FPAPP-A (&lt;1.27, 1.27-1.74, &gt;1.74 mIU/L) and TPAPP-A (&lt;1.98, 1.98-2.99, &gt;2.99 mIU/L) tertiles, this endpoint was met by 12 (13.5%), 18 (20.2%), 27 (30.3%) (P = 0.02), and 17 (19.1%), 17 (19.1%), 23 (25.8%) (P = 0.54) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, and ischemic electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) findings, FPAPP-A &gt;1.74 mIU/L [risk ratio (RR) 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-4.1, P = 0.053), increased cTnI, and CRP &gt;/=2.0 mg/L were independent predictors of an endpoint. The prognostic performance of TPAPP-A was inferior to that of FPAPP-A. CONCLUSIONS: FPAPP-A seems to be superior as a prognostic marker compared to TPAPP-A, giving independent and additive prognostic information when measured at the time of admission in patients hospitalized for non-ST-elevation ACS.",M2
20444813,"Prognosis for neonates with enterovirus myocarditis.OBJECTIVE: To assess the severity of the disease and the long-term cardiac prognosis for neonates who developed enterovirus (EV) myocarditis within the first weeks of life. DESIGN: Clinical presentation, echocardiographic and <e>ECG</e> findings and the outcome of seven infants with EV myocarditis admitted to the intensive care unit are reported. Additionally, 28 previously reported cases are described. RESULTS: Seven neonates presented with cardiac failure within 17 days after birth requiring respiratory and circulatory support. Echocardiography showed dilatation and severe dysfunction of the left ventricle in all and mitral regurgitation in six. In six patients the echocardiographic pattern resembled myocardial infarction. ECG showed complete loss of the R-wave and a new Q-wave in the left precordial leads in all. Two infants died and five developed long-term cardiac sequelae requiring medication. In all survivors aneurysm formation in the left ventricular wall was found weeks to months later. One patient is awaiting heart transplantation. Coxsackie virus B was detected in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal swab or stool by PCR or culture. The mortality of previously described neonates combined with our seven cases was 31% (11/35). Among the survivors 66% (16/24) developed severe cardiac damage. Only 23% (8/35) of the infants fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: EV myocarditis is a rare but severe disease in the neonatal period, which often leads to death or results in serious chronic cardiac sequelae like chronic heart failure, aneurysm formation within the left ventricle and mitral regurgitation. Chronic cardiac drug therapy is necessary in the majority of these patients.",M2
20410536,"Overview of electrocardiographic findings and clinical presentation of common cardiac arrhythmias.PURPOSE: To review the components and interpretation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) and compare and contrast the ECG waveforms and clinical presentation associated with major cardiac arrhythmias. SUMMARY: A 12-lead ECG reflects the electrical activity of the heart from many different perspectives, and individual leads may reveal conduction disturbances and disorders in a particular area of the heart. Components of the ECG complex include the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. The timing and amplitude of ECG waveforms provide valuable information about heart rate and rhythm. This information can be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms to differentiate between major arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSION: The monitoring of drug therapies used to treat arrhythmias is facilitated by an understanding of ECG interpretation and the typical clinical characteristics of major cardiac arrhythmias.",M2

20440083,"Identification of predictors of inhospital postreperfusion mode of death in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to identify the predictors of the postreperfusion mode of death using the distinctions in clinical characteristics of patients who died and survived after reperfusion therapy, treated due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). MATERIAL AND METHODS. This consecutive study has involved 36 patients: 18 patients who died from progressive heart failure (PHF) (group 1, n=13) or from cardiac rupture (CR) (group 2, n=5) after primary coronary intervention. The control group consisted of 18 randomly selected patients who survived in-hospital period (group 3). The initial and postreperfusion heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (SAP and DAP), maximal ST elevation (max ST upward arrow) and depression (max ST downward arrow), ST score, TIMI flow grade, coronary score (CS), and their perireperfusion changes were assessed for each patient. The complex prognostic predictors--TIMI Risk Score and TIMI Risk Index--were also assessed. The data analysis was performed by standard statistical and machine learning approach methods. RESULTS. The comparison of three patients' groups according to simple <e>ECG</e> or circulatory characteristics showed that more significant differences were seen in postreperfusion characteristics or their perireperfusion changes. Herewith, the major part of significantly different characteristics (baseline SAP, DAP, and HR, postreperfusion SAP, DAP, ST score, and TIMI flow grade, resolution of ST score) was observed comparing both the groups of dead patients with survivors (control group). The differences in the complex predictors (TIMI Risk Score and TIMI Risk Index) were similar. However, the smallest number of significantly different characteristics was seen comparing both the groups of dead patients. The baseline DAP (P=0.045), postreperfusion SAP (P=0.04) and DAP (P=0.03), and ST score (P=0.0025) were higher in the patients who died from CR. The postreperfusion ST score and SAP were also identified as necessary components in the assessment of informative prognostic sets according to feature selection methods used in data mining field. CONCLUSION. The postreperfusion ST score, SAP, and DAP could be useful for the prediction of in-hospital postreperfusion mode of death in patients with STEMI; evidently more clinical predictors could be useful for the prediction of general occurrence of postreperfusion deaths.",M2
20437819,"Chronophysiologic aspects of <e>ECG</e> changes during a systemic asphyxic episode and subsequent reoxygenation in an experimental rat model.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of ventilatory manoeuvres on some ECG parameters as a function of the light-dark (LD) cycle in in vivo conditions. The PQ and QT intervals were measured in ketamine/xylazine-anaesthetized female Wistar rats (100 mg/15 mg/kg, i.m.) after adaptation to an LD cycle (12:12 h). The animals were exposed to a 2 min apneic episode and subsequent 20 min period of reoxygenation. Significant LD differences were found in the duration of the PQ interval (p &lt; 0.001) after 30 and 60 sec., and in the QT interval after 90 (p &lt; 0.01) and 120 sec. (p &lt; 0.001), apneic episode. Reoxygenation restored the PQ and QT intervals with the preservation of LD differences from the pre-asphyxic period. It is concluded that although long-term asphyxia probably minimized LD differences in the duration of the PQ interval, the dispersion of refractory periods increases by the manner depending on LD cycle. Reoxygenation did not act proarrhythmogenicly and the followed parameters were recovered to the pre-asphyxic level (Fig. 5, Ref. 43).",M2
20435852,"Mitochondrial KATP channel inhibition blunts arrhythmia protection in ischemic exercised hearts.The mechanisms responsible for anti-arrhythmic protection during ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in exercised hearts are not fully understood. The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether the ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the mitochondria (mito K(ATP)) and sarcolemma (sarc K(ATP)) provide anti-arrhythmic protection in exercised hearts during IR. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to cardioprotective treadmill exercise or sedentary conditions before IR (I = 20 min, R = 30 min) in vivo. Subsets of exercised animals received pharmacological inhibitors for mito K(ATP) (5-hydroxydecanoate) or sarc K(ATP) (HMR1098) before IR. Blinded analysis of digital <e>ECG</e> tracings revealed that mito K(ATP) inhibition blunted the anti-arrhythmic effects of exercise, while sarc K(ATP) inhibition did not. Endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities for total, CuZn, and Mn superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase from ischemic and perfused ventricular tissue were not mitigated by IR, although oxidative stress was elevated in sedentary and mito K(ATP)-inhibited hearts from exercised animals. These findings suggest that the mito K(ATP) channel provides anti-arrhythmic protection as part of exercise-mediated cardioprotection against IR. Furthermore, these data suggest that the observed anti-arrhythmic protection may be associated with preservation of redox balance in exercised hearts.",M2
20435193,"Prognostic impact of baseline and serial changes in electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in resistant hypertension.BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (<e>ECG</e>-LVH) in resistant hypertension (RH) is unknown. The aim was to evaluate the importance of baseline and serial changes in ECG-LVH as predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with RH. METHODS: At baseline and during follow-up, 552 resistant hypertensive patients had 3 ECG-LVH criteria obtained: Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell voltage, and Cornell voltage-duration product. Primary end points were a composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Total strokes and coronary heart disease (CHD) events were secondary end points. Multiple Cox regression assessed the associations between time-varying ECG-LVH and subsequent end points. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 70 patients died, 46 from cardiovascular causes; and 109 total cardiovascular events occurred, 46 strokes, and 44 CHD events. After adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, baseline Cornell voltage and product, but not Sokolow-Lyon voltage, were independent predictors of the composite end point and of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Reductions of all ECG-LVH criteria were protective factors for the composite end point: a 1-SD (1.1 mV) reduction in Sokolow-Lyon voltage was associated with a 35% lower risk (95% CI 10%-53%) of cardiovascular events, whereas prevention or regression of Cornell product LVH criterion implied a 40% lower risk (95% CI 11%-60%). Baseline and serial changes in Sokolow-Lyon voltage were independent predictors of strokes, whereas Cornell voltage was predictive of CHD events. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline and serial changes in ECG-LVH predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in RH patients. Antihypertensive treatment targeted at regression or prevention of ECG-LVH may improve prognosis.",M2

20432710,"[Myocardial electrogenesis in laboratory rats under conditions of acute nitrite intoxication]In anesthetized male rats the arterial blood pressure in femoral artery and electrocardiogram in standard leads were recorded uninterruptedly for 1-1.5 h under conditions of acute nitrite intoxication produced by a subcutaneous injection of water solution of sodium nitrite (donor of nitric oxide) at concentrations of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg body mass. Results of the study have shown dose-dependent changes of arterial pressure as well as of time and amplitude characteristics of electrocardiogram under effect of NaNO2. At the threshold hypoxic dose, an increase of amplitude of R and S waves was observed by the 30-45th min, while at the maximal NaNO2 dose, amplitude of all waves rose by the 15th min of intoxication. High nitric doses often caused an increase of the ST segment above the isoelectric line and a rise of the amplitude of the T wave, on which a notch appeared in some cases. The change of the <e>ECG</e> time parameters was expressed in the dose-dependent development of bradycardia for the first 4-7 min; its level correlated with the progressively decreasing arterial pressure in the beginning (the 2-4th min) of nitrite intoxication. Variation analysis of heart rate spectral characteristics by Baevskii has revealed a rise of the total spectral power of pulse oscillations. Under effect of nitrite, in the spectrum of cardiointervals, quent recovery of the normal ECG spectrum in the end of the experimental period. The maximal nitrite dose produced more pronounced shifts of the heart rate spectrum towards the LF and VLF diapasons that were not restored for 1 h of experiment. Transitory processes of readjustment of the cardiac rhythm had discrete character. The nitrite dose of 50 mg/kg body mass increased the RR-interval after 4-7 min with amplitude steps of 3-5 imp/s and the time constant of 20-40 s. The revealed ECG changes had the reflex (enhancement of parasympathetic tonus) and metabolic (the hypoxic and histotoxic damage of myocardium) nature.",M2

AIM: To assess the predictors of long term outcome after PCI for acute anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing PCI within 12 hours from the onset of the first AMI were enrolled. Troponin I, CK-MB, creatinine, NT-proBNP, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) function, myocardial contrast perfusion, results of coronary angiography, <e>ECG</e>, 24-hour Holter ECG, and T-wave alternans (TWA) were analysed as predictors of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, non-fatal reinfarction, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and rehospitalisation for decompensated heart failure. Patients were followed up for two years. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients developed MACE. The best predictive model for MACE consisted of impaired perfusion (MCE, myocardial contrast echocardiography), higher CK-MB at 24 hours, discharge NT-proBNP, and non-negative TWA. The combination of elevated creatinine level, decreased LV ejection fraction, and a non-negative TWA proved the best for identification of patients at risk of cardiac death. The best multivariate model for predicting heart failure hospitalisation consisted of higher 24-hour CK-MB, discharge NT-proBNP, impaired perfusion and prolonged duration of ST elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the rate of MACE in patients with anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI at two years follow-up is low. A combined assessment of myocardial contrast perfusion, TWA, CK-MB and discharge NT-proBNP seems to optimally predict patients at risk of MACE.",M2
20422818,"Clinical significance of isolated sternal fracture.BACKGROUND: Isolated sternal fractures (ISF) are uncommon injuries and after exclusion of other concomitant injuries, ISF can be classified as harmless injuries, and can be treated on outpatient basis. OBJECTIVE: Based on literature and own experience to make a simple algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of ISF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who were admitted with ISF to the Clinic for Thoracic Surgery of UCC Sarajevo between January 2000 and January 2010. RESULTS: A review included 49 patients with ISF. The average age was 52.67 +/- 12.42 (range 21 to 81) years. Age group between 41 and 61 years was significantly more prone to ISF. Male/female ratio was 2.2:1 (34/15). The major cause of the injury, seen in 77.6% (38/49) cases, was an involvement in road traffic accidents (RTAs). Statistically, there is a significant difference (chi2 = 6.74; p = 0.009) in the frequency of occurrence ISF between drivers [55.1% (27/38)] and passengers [22.4% (11/39)]. Of the remaining eleven patients, four ISF were caused by falls at home, and seven by direct violence to the chest either in sport or in a fight. The sternal view radiography was diagnostic in all patients In most patients [83.7% (41/49)] the enzymatic values were elevated. <e>ECGs</e> were recorded in all cases, of which only 12.2% (6/49) had an abnormality. The average duration of hospitalization was 3.57 +/- 2.01 (range 1 to 7) days. It should be noted that 34.7% of patients were discharged in less than 24h and 73.5% were discharged in under 48h. Commonly used analgesic, metamizol, was applied in 98.0% (48/49) of cases. The combination of tramadol and metamizol was given in 63.3% (32/49) of patients. CONCLUSION: Established results support the view that patients with ISF and no abnormality in ECG and cardiac enzymes during the early hours after injury are expected to have a benign course and can be discharged home within the first 24 to 48 hours. Proposed algorithm can be of assistance In making such decisions.",M2

20410469,"Heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity response to acute stress: the effect of breathing.Previous research has suggested a relationship between low-frequency power of heart rate variability (HRV; LF in normalized units, LFnu) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). However, investigations have not systematically controlled for breathing, which can modulate both HRV and MSNA. Accordingly, the aims of this experiment were to investigate the possibility of parallel responses in MSNA and HRV (LFnu) to selected acute stressors and the effect of controlled breathing. After data were obtained at rest, 12 healthy males (28 +/- 5 yr) performed isometric handgrip exercise (30% maximal voluntary contraction) and the cold pressor test in random order, and were then exposed to hypoxia (inspired fraction of O(2) = 0.105) for 7 min, during randomly assigned spontaneous and controlled breathing conditions (20 breaths/min, constant tidal volume, isocapnic). MSNA was recorded from the peroneal nerve, whereas HRV was calculated from <e>ECG</e>. At rest, controlled breathing did not alter MSNA but decreased LFnu (P &lt; 0.05 for all) relative to spontaneous breathing. MSNA increased in response to all stressors regardless of breathing. LFnu increased with exercise during both breathing conditions. During cold pressor, LFnu decreased when breathing was spontaneous, whereas in the controlled breathing condition, LFnu was unchanged from baseline. Hypoxia elicited increases in LFnu when breathing was controlled, but not during spontaneous breathing. The parallel changes observed during exercise and controlled breathing during hypoxia suggest that LFnu may be an indication of sympathetic outflow in select conditions. However, since MSNA and LFnu did not change in parallel with all stressors, a cautious approach to the use of LFnu as a marker of sympathetic activity is warranted.",M2

We performed exercise electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>), technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography, dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography, and coronary angiography in 76 hypertensive women. Of the 76 study patients, 31 (41%) had significant CAD. The sensitivity of exercise ECG (81%), MIBI scanning (90%), and dobutamine echocardiography (87%) was greater than that of dipyridamole echocardiography (61%). This finding resulted from the lower sensitivity of dipyridamole echocardiography in the detection of single-vessel CAD (47% vs 76%, 88%, and 82% for the other 3 methods). In contrast, the sensitivity of the 4 tests was similar in the detection of multivessel CAD. The specificity of exercise ECG (56%) and MIBI scanning (53%) was less than that of dobutamine (82%, both p &lt;0.01) and dipyridamole (91%, both p &lt;0.001) echocardiography. This finding related to the lower specificity of exercise ECG in patients with either left ventricular hypertrophy or ST-T abnormalities at rest compared to the specificity in patients without these disorders (33% vs 89%, p &lt;0.01). A lower MIBI scan specificity was found only in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (31% vs 66%, p &lt;0.05). The overall accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography reached 84% compared to exercise ECG (66%, p &lt;0.01), MIBI scan (68%, p &lt;0.05), and dipyridamole echocardiography (79%, p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, dobutamine echocardiography yielded satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for identifying CAD in hypertensive women. Although dipyridamole echocardiography had the greatest specificity, it might be limited in detecting mild CAD. Both exercise ECG and MIBI scanning had fare sensitivity; however, our findings limit the usefulness of these 2 tests in unselected patients.",M2
20394896,"Pericardial fat burden on <e>ECG</e>-gated noncontrast CT in asymptomatic patients who subsequently experience adverse cardiovascular events.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate whether pericardial fat has value in predicting the risk of future adverse cardiovascular outcomes. BACKGROUND: Pericardial fat volume (PFV) and thoracic fat volume (TFV) can be routinely measured from noncontrast computed tomography (NCT) performed for calculating coronary calcium score (CCS) and may predict major adverse cardiac event (MACE) risk. METHODS: From a registry of 2,751 asymptomatic patients without known cardiac artery disease and 4-year follow-up for MACE (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, late revascularization) after NCT, we compared 58 patients with MACE with 174 same-sex, event-free control subjects matched by a propensity score to account for age, risk factors, and CCS. The TFV was automatically calculated, and PFV was calculated with manual assistance in defining the pericardial contour, within which fat voxels were automatically identified. Independent relationships of PFV and TFV to MACE were evaluated using conditional multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients experiencing MACE had higher mean PFV (101.8 +/- 49.2 cm(3) vs. 84.9 +/- 37.7 cm(3), p = 0.007) and TFV (204.7 +/- 90.3 cm(3) vs. 177 +/- 80.3 cm(3), p = 0.029) and higher frequencies of PFV &gt;125 cm(3) (33% vs. 14%, p = 0.002) and TFV &gt;250 cm(3) (31% vs. 17%, p = 0.025). After adjustment for Framingham risk score (FRS), CCS, and body mass index, PFV and TFV were significantly associated with MACE (odds ratio [OR]: 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.95 for each doubling of PFV; OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.14 for TFV). The area under the curve from receiver-operator characteristic analyses showed a trend of improved MACE prediction when PFV was added to FRS and CCS (0.73 vs. 0.68, p = 0.058). Addition of PFV, but not TFV, to FRS and CCS improved estimated specificity (0.72 vs. 0.66, p = 0.008) and overall accuracy (0.70 vs. 0.65, p = 0.009) in predicting MACE. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients who experience MACE exhibit greater PFV on pre-MACE NCT when they are compared with event-free control subjects with similar cardiovascular risk profiles. Our preliminary findings suggest that PFV may help improve prediction of MACE.",M2
20392939,"Kv1.1 potassium channel deficiency reveals brain-driven cardiac dysfunction as a candidate mechanism for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.Mice lacking Kv1.1 Shaker-like potassium channels encoded by the Kcna1 gene exhibit severe seizures and die prematurely. The channel is widely expressed in brain but only minimally, if at all, in mouse myocardium. To test whether Kv1.1-potassium deficiency could underlie primary neurogenic cardiac dysfunction, we performed simultaneous video EEG-<e>ECG</e> recordings and found that Kcna1-null mice display potentially malignant interictal cardiac abnormalities, including a fivefold increase in atrioventricular (AV) conduction blocks, as well as bradycardia and premature ventricular contractions. During seizures the occurrence of AV conduction blocks increased, predisposing Kv1.1-deficient mice to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which we recorded fortuitously in one animal. To determine whether the interictal AV conduction blocks were of cardiac or neural origin, we examined their response to selective pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Simultaneous administration of atropine and propranolol to block parasympathetic and sympathetic branches, respectively, eliminated conduction blocks. When administered separately, only atropine ameliorated AV conduction blocks, indicating that excessive parasympathetic tone contributes to the neurocardiac defect. We found no changes in Kv1.1-deficient cardiac structure, but extensive Kv1.1 expression in juxtaparanodes of the wild-type vagus nerve, the primary source of parasympathetic input to the heart, suggesting a novel site of action leading to Kv1.1-associated cardiac bradyarrhythmias. Together, our data suggest that Kv1.1 deficiency leads to impaired neural control of cardiac rhythmicity due in part to aberrant parasympathetic neurotransmission, making Kcna1 a strong candidate gene for human SUDEP.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University, Karachi, from June to September 2007. METHODOLOGY: All patients with LVEF &lt; 35% were included. Apical 2-D images were obtained in 4 chamber and 2 chamber views. TDI pulse wave Doppler parameters were measured from these 2 color-coded images. Time interval between the onset of QRS complex and the peak systolic velocity per region was derived. Patients with valvular heart disease, mitral annular calcification, atrial fibrillation and paced rhythm were excluded. Fischer's exact test was used to determine the association between QRS duration and left ventricular dyssynchrony. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included. Twenty one patients had QRS duration of &gt; 120 msec. Out of those 21 patients, a total of 6 patients (28.6%) had evidence of dyssynchrony on TDI. Five patients (23.8%) had dyssynchrony on the basis of basal septal and basal lateral velocity difference (p=0.045) and 6 patients (28.6%) had evidence of dyssynchrony based on basal anterior and basal inferior velocity difference (p=0.018). Out of the remaining 39 patients with narrow QRS complex, only 2 patients (5.1%) had dyssynchrony on TDI. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a significant association between prolonged QRS duration and left ventricular dyssynchrony on TDI. Therefore, such patients should be screened for prolonged QRS duration on <e>ECG</e> before cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospectively planned analysis of the clinical, biomarker, angiographic, and continuous <e>ECG</e> features and 1-year outcomes of women with unstable ischemic heart disease randomized to ranolazine or placebo in Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 36 (MERLIN-TIMI 36). Compared with men (n=4269), women (n=2291) were older with more risk factors (P&lt;0.001). On presentation, women were less likely than men to have significant epicardial coronary artery disease (no stenosis &gt;or=50% on angiography, 19.4% versus 8.6%; P&lt;0.001) or elevated troponin (57.1% versus 68.9%; P&lt;0.001). Yet, women were more likely to have an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (47.0% versus 40.2%; P&lt;0.001), worse median angina frequency scores (80 versus 100; P&lt;0.001), and an ischemic episode on continuous ECG administered during the first 7 days (22.5% versus 19.3%; P=0.0025). Women and men were at similar adjusted risk for the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.29; P=0.15). Ranolazine was associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia in women (13.0% versus 18.2%; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.88; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Women with a clinical syndrome consistent with unstable ischemic heart disease, despite having less obstructive coronary artery disease, were more likely than men to report anginal episodes and had more recorded ischemic periods on continuous ECG. In this setting, ranolazine may be a particularly useful antiischemic agent in women. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00099788.",M2
20384763,"Too long or too short? New insights into abnormal cardiac repolarization in people with chronic epilepsy and its potential role in sudden unexpected death.SUMMARY: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is probably caused by periictal cardiorespiratory alterations such as central apnea, bradyarrhythmia, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These alterations may occur in people with epilepsy and vary in duration and severity. Seizure-related ventricular tachyarrhythmias have also been hypothesized to be involved in SUDEP, but compelling evidence of these, or of predisposition to these, is lacking. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are facilitated by pathologic cardiac repolarization. Electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>) indicators of pathologic cardiac repolarization, such as prolongation or shortening of QT intervals as well as increased QT dispersion, are established risk factors for life-threatening tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SDC). Abnormalities in cardiac repolarization have recently been described in people with epilepsy. Importantly, periictal ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation have also been reported in the absence of any underlying cardiac disease. Therefore, pathologic cardiac repolarization could promote SCD in people with epilepsy and could be one plausible cause for SUDEP. Herein, we review abnormal cardiac repolarization in people with epilepsy, describe the putative contribution of antiepileptic drugs, and discuss the potential role of pathologic cardiac repolarization in SUDEP. Based on these, measures to reduce the risk of or prevent SUDEP may include antiarrhythmic medication and implantation of cardiac combined pacemaker-defibrillator devices.",M2
20382862,"Activation becomes highly organized during long-duration ventricular fibrillation in canine hearts.Little is known about the three-dimensional (3-D) intramural activation sequences during long-duration ventricular fibrillation (VF), including the role of the subendocardium and its Purkinje fibers (PFs) in long-duration VF maintenance. Our aim was to explore the mechanism of long-duration VF maintenance with 3-D electrical mapping. We recorded 10 min of electrically induced VF in the left ventricular anterior free wall of six 10-kg, open-chest dogs using a 3-D transmural unipolar electrode matrix (9 x 9 x 6, 2-mm spacing) that allowed us to map intramural activation sequences. At 2.5 + or - 1.8 min of VF, although the body surface <e>ECG</e> continued to exhibit a disorganized VF pattern, intramurally a more organized, synchronous activation pattern was first observed [locally synchronized VF (LSVF)]. This pattern occurred one or more times in all dogs and was present 33.4 + or - 31.4% of the time during 5-10 min of VF. As opposed to the preceding changing complex activation sequences of VF, during LSVF, wavefronts were large and highly repeatable near the endocardium, first exciting the endocardium almost simultaneously and then rapidly spreading toward the epicardium with different levels of conduction block en route. During LSVF, PF activations always preceded working myocardium activations near the endocardium. In conclusion, long-duration VF in dogs frequently becomes highly organized in the subendocardium, with activation fronts arising in this region and passing intramurally toward the epicardium, even though the surface ECG continues to exhibit a disorganized pattern. PFs appear to play an important role during this stage of VF.",M2

20367558,"Determinants of the release pattern of ischaemia-modified albumin in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary PCI.BACKGROUND: Ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) is proposed as a marker of cardiac ischaemia. Release kinetics of IMA have not been investigated during ongoing acute coronary syndrome. We evaluated IMA kinetics in patients with ongoing ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and revascularization by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as a model. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with STEMI undergoing successful pPCI (Age: median 65 y, range 41-79 y; symptoms duration: median 4 h, range 1-7 h). Fourteen blood samples were collected (11 during the first 24 h following pPCI) and analyzed for IMA, cardiac troponin T, CKMBmass, myoglobin, and heart-type fatty acid binding protein. RESULTS: Following pPCI, mean IMA increased to 16% above baseline, normalizing within less than 3 h. At the time of pPCI, patients with TIMI 0 flow in the infarct artery had low levels of IMA and only exhibited a rise in IMA levels after pPCI, whereas patients with TIMI 1-3 flow had high IMA levels on arrival with a subsequent decrease (p &lt; 0.036). There was no statistically significant association between IMA and other variables, e.g. <e>ECG</e>, symptoms duration, sex, age, blood pressure, and number of vessels affected. Relative concentrations of IMA were low compared with other cardiac biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IMA release may depend on reperfusion-induced events rather than ischaemia per se. Further, we find a narrow diagnostic time window and a low sensitivity of the IMA assay. Improved understanding of the release mechanisms of IMA is needed before clinical application of the test.",M2
20364551,"Prevalences and association of <e>ECG</e> findings and cardiovascular risk factor in Shinawatra employees.OBJECTIVES: There is significant incline trend in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in developing countries such as Thailand and it is also the major contributor to the burden of premature mortality and morbidity throughout the world. In order to have well-stratified primary prevention plan, this study reports the prevalence of Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, as categorized by ECG Minnesota coding, and the association with major cardiovascular risk factors in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this study, we use the same data from a previous survey at Shinawatra Employee but only subjects with available ECG's were recruited in our study. Standard supine 12-lead ECG data were collected; all amplitude and intervals were measured and entered into a computer manually. Then the ECG was coded according to Minnesota Coding system. The study characteristics, the prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors and ECG abnormalities were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1,485 subjects were recruited in this study, 638 (43.0%) were male and 847 (57.0%) were female. The overall mean aged was 34.4 (5.4). The level of major cardiovascular risk factors among men and women respectively were: total Cholesterol 215.6 (41.0) mg/dl (5.6 (1.1) mmol/l), 202.8 (35.3) mg/dl (5.3 (0.9) mmol/l); LDL-cholesterol 139.1 (37.0) (3.6 (1.0) mmol/l), 123.6 (31.9) (3.2 (0.8) mmol/l). Hypercholesterolemia was 65.3%, 49.8%. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 121.5 (13.9) mmHg and 81.4 (10.5) mmHg, 111.7 (12.2) mmHg and 74.5 (8.6) mmHg; hypertension 21.0%, 4.2%; fasting blood sugar 95.5 (15.8) mg/dl (5.3 (0.9) mmol/l), 88.0 (8.6) mg/dl (5.1 (0.5) mmol/l); diabetes mellitus 3.3%, 0.5%; body mass index 23.5 (3.5) (kg/m2), 21.3 (3.1) (kg/m2); obesity 30.7%, 11.0%; smoking 12.3%, 14.0%. The prevalence of ECG abnormalities, as categorized based on the Minnesota coding criteria, among men and women respectively were: Q/QS wave abnormalities (Code 1) 2.2%, 0.8%; S-T-J segment depression (Code 4) 0.5%, 1.4%; T-wave inversion (Code 5) 1.4%, 9.6%; atrioventricular conduction abnormalities (Code 6) 2.5%, 0.8%; and ventricular conduction abnormalities (Code 7) 0.2%, 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports higher prevalence of having major cardiovascular risk factors as compared to previous epidemiological studies in Thailand which should heighten the Ministry of Public Health concern to launch a better stratified preventive plan to combat the rising of coronary artery disease in the future. Moreover, this study is also the first study to report the prevalence of ECG abnormalities, as determined on the basis of the Minnesota coding criteria, and the association between major cardiovascular risk factors and the prevalences of several electrocardiographic findings in adult men and women in Thailand.",M2
20362725,"Diagnostic and prognostic utility of electrocardiography for left ventricular hypertrophy defined by magnetic resonance imaging in relationship to ethnicity: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).BACKGROUND: Left ventricular mass is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart is a standard of reference for left ventricular mass measurement. Ethnicity is believed to affect electrocardiographic (<e>ECG</e>) performance. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of ECG for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as defined by MRI in relationship to ethnicity. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 4,967 participants (48% men, mean age 62 +/- 10 years; 39% white, 13% Chinese, 26% African American, 22% Hispanic) enrolled in the Multi-Ethic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who were followed for a median of 4.8 years for incident CVD. RESULTS: Thirteen traditional ECG-LVH criteria were assessed, and showed overall and ethnicity-specific low sensitivity (10%-26%) and high specificity (88%-99%) in diagnosing MRI-defined LVH. Ten of 13 ECG-LVH criteria showed superior sensitivity and diagnostic performance in African Americans as compared with whites (P = .02-.001). The sum of amplitudes of S wave in V(1), S wave in V(2), and R wave in V(5) (a MESA-specific ECG-LVH criterion) offered higher sensitivity (40.4%) compared with prior ECG-LVH criteria while maintaining good specificity (90%) and diagnostic performance (receiver operating characteristic area = 0.65). In fully adjusted models, only the MESA-specific ECG-LVH criterion, Romhilt-Estes score, Framingham score, Cornell voltage, Cornell duration product, and Framingham-adjusted Cornell voltage predicted increased CVD risk (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiography has low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting MRI-defined LVH. The performance of ECG for LVH detection varies by ethnicity, with African Americans showing higher sensitivity and overall performance compared with other ethnic groups.",M2

20358535,"Evaluation of the surface <e>ECG</e> in detecting isthmus conduction block after ablation of typical atrial flutter.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of changes in P wave morphology and duration detected by surface electrocardiogram (ECG) during proximal coronary sinus (PCS) and low lateral right atrial (LLRA) stimulation as a marker for complete bidirectional isthmus conduction block in the procedure of typical atrial flutter ablation. METHODS: Morphology, duration, and ratio of a positive terminal P wave were estimated in 52 typical atrial flutter patients before and after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). RESULTS: Atrial flutter ablation resulted in a complete bidirectional isthmus block in all 52 patients. The terminal portion of the P wave towards a positive morphology was detected in 90.7% (47/52) patients both during PCS and LLRA stimulation. These changes were predominantly observed in the inferior leads. Positive morphological changes of the terminal P wave portion and the measured P wave ratio (40% +/- 12%) in the inferior leads indicating bidirectional isthmus conduction block with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 91.7% were observed. An increment of 20 ms or more in P wave duration during the PCS stimulation and 10 ms or more during the LLRA stimulation indicating the conduction block with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The variation of P wave morphology and duration in inferior leads of the surface ECG is a helpful technique to assess the complete bidirectional isthmus conduction block in the procedure of typical atrial flutter ablation.",M2

20357153,"Accuracy of preoperative electrocardiographic and chest radiographic screening for prediction of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with suspected neuromuscular disorders.BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the reliability of electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>) and chest radiography (CXR) in predicting left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with suspected neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) undergoing preanesthetic evaluation for muscle biopsy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 255 patients with a preliminary diagnosis of NMDs based on history, physical examination, and laboratory testing underwent preanesthetic screening before muscle biopsy. The screening included various combinations of ECG, CXR, and transthoracic echocardiography (Echo) to assess perioperative risk associated with potentially undiagnosed LV dysfunction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to ascertain whether CXR and ECG were independently predictive of LV dysfunction. In addition, receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of each test and the combination of CXR and ECG in differentiating LV dysfunction from normal function based on Echo  gold standard  data. RESULTS: The study consisted of 255 patients who had a transthoracic Echo, and among these patients, 235 had CXR and 237 had ECG. Forty-four patients were diagnosed by transthoracic Echo to have LV dysfunction (17.3%). Of the 255 patients in the study population, 24 were found to have mild LV dysfunction (9.4%) and 20 had moderate to severe LV dysfunction (7.8%) on Echo. With Echo providing the definitive standard for the diagnosis of LV dysfunction, we found that a CXR alone was predictive in 37% of cases of LV dysfunction, an ECG alone was predictive in 14% of cases, and the combination of both was predictive in 81% of cases. The combination of ECG and CXR test offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve of 0.95, P &lt; 0.0001) for differentiating moderate to severe LV dysfunction from normal LV function. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected neuromuscular disease, CXR and ECG provided low independent diagnostic prediction for the presence or absence of LV dysfunction. The combination of both tests can identify cardiomyopathy with relatively high accuracy in children with suspected NMDs independent of age and gender, particularly in patients with moderate to severe LV dysfunction. Although our findings suggest that combination ECG and CXR screening is a reliable means of detecting LV dysfunction, this approach fails to differentiate the severity or type of cardiomyopathy that may exist. Therefore, the decision to obtain a perioperative Echo before muscle biopsy should involve careful consideration of the disease suspected, ECG and CXR results, laboratory studies, patient age, physical examination, and family history.",M2
20350987,"Dynamic electrocardiographic changes in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Electrocardiographic (<e>ECG</e>) abnormalities of depolarisation and repolarisation contribute to the diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The development of diagnostic ECG features were investigated in a genotyped cohort with ARVC to provide more sensitive markers of early disease. METHODS: T-wave inversion (TWI) in right precordial leads, epsilon waves, localised QRS prolongation greater than 110 ms in V1-V3 and QRS dispersion greater than 40 ms were analysed from 317 ECG from 68 genotyped patients (34 with disease-causing mutations) during follow-up of 34+/-28 months. RESULTS: 16 patients (23%) had changes during follow-up, with the appearance of new ECG abnormalities in seven (10%) and dynamic changes in nine (13%). Four developed new and persistent TWI and eight had dynamic TWI in right precordial leads. Three developed new and another three had dynamic epsilon waves. No changes were observed in 10 with and 58 patients without localised QRS prolongation and in six patients with and 61 without QRS dispersion greater than 40 ms. An additional patient with QRS dispersion at baseline had normal depolarisation dispersion during follow-up. None of the nine ARVC patients with dynamic ECG changes had major structural or functional right ventricular abnormalities, suggesting an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: New or dynamic ECG changes were observed in 23%. This underscores the importance of serial ECG in the diagnosis of individuals at risk of ARVC, in whom potentially lethal arrhythmia may develop before major abnormalities are detectable with conventional imaging.",M2

20333388,"Dynamic myocardial stress perfusion imaging using fast dual-source CT with alternating table positions: initial experience.OBJECTIVE: To detail the principles of using model-based determination of regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) by computed tomography (CT) and demonstrate its in vivo applicability. METHODS: Dual-source CT was performed with a dynamic protocol comprising acquisition with alternating table positions in <e>ECG</e>-triggered end-systolic timing every second for 30 s. The results of two reconstructions were merged into one final image stack (coverage 73 mm), with low spatial frequency components from a 360 degrees reconstruction and high spatial frequency components from a dual-source cardiac partial image reconstruction. A parametric deconvolution technique was used to fit the time-attenuation curves (TAC), the maximum slope of which was used to derive MBF. RESULTS: One study participant underwent dynamic myocardial stress perfusion imaging (9.6 mSv) followed by invasive coronary angiography and measurement of fractional flow reserve as the gold standard. MBF was 159 ml/100 ml/min in the non-ischaemic anterolateral and 86 ml/100 ml/min in the inferoseptal ischaemic wall. CONCLUSION: This first evaluation indicates that mathematical modelling of voxel TACs can potentially be used to quantify differences in MBF in a clinical setting. If confirmed in feasibility studies, cardiac CT may allow for parallel assessment of morphology and haemodynamic relevance of coronary artery disease.",M2
20329408,"Coronary heart disease in rural population of Himachal--a population based study.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease has emerged as a major health burden worldwide.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in <e>ECG</e>-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",M2
20308494,"Effect of padding duration on radiation dose and image interpretation in prospectively <e>ECG</e>-triggered coronary CT angiography.OBJECTIVE: Prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CT angiography images are acquired during a window in middiastole. Additional surrounding x-ray beam on time, or padding, can be variably set, and the increased padding results in additional available phases for analysis. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of padding duration on image interpretability and its incident effect on radiation dose. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated imaging of 886 patients undergoing consecutive prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CT angiographic examinations at three centers and compared the findings in patients stratified by padding duration. We assessed the effect of padding duration on image interpretability and radiation dose. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 56 +/- 12 years, and 58% of the patients were men. The median heart rate was 55 beats/min (interquartile range, 50-61 beats/min). Padding duration was 0, 1-99, and 100-150 milliseconds for 268, 482, and 136 patients, respectively, with no difference in image interpretability rate between groups (per patient, 98.8%, 97.3%, and 97.1%; per artery, 99.2%, 99.2%, and 99.1%). The groups differed in median radiation dose (2.3 mSv [interquartile range, 1.5-3.2 mSv]; 3.8 mSv [interquartile range, 2.3-4.7 mSv]; 5.5 mSv [interquartile range, 3.8-6.1 mSv]; p &lt; 0.001). Independent of patient and scan parameters, increased padding was associated with greater radiation dose (45% increase per 100-millisecond increase in padding, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In a large multicenter study of coronary CT angiography of patients with excellent heart rate control, the use of minimal padding was associated with a substantial reduction in radiation dose with preserved image interpretability. Use of no or reduced padding should be considered in dose-reduction strategies.",M2
20308492,"Combined cardiac CT and MRI for the comprehensive workup of hemodynamically relevant coronary stenoses.OBJECTIV:. The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of a comprehensive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) with prospectively <e>ECG</e>-gated coronary CT angiography (CTA) and perfusion-cardiac MRI for the detection of hemodynamically relevant coronary stenoses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients underwent k-space and time broad-use linear acquisition speed-up technique accelerated perfusion-cardiac MRI at 1.5 T and dual-source coronary CTA. Catheter coronary angiography (CA), coronary CTA, and perfusion-cardiac MRI were all performed within a median time interval of 7.5 days. Detection of hemodynamically relevant stenoses by the combination of coronary CTA plus perfusion-cardiac MRI was compared with the combination of CA plus perfusion-cardiac MRI, the latter serving as the standard of reference. RESULTS: CA identified stenoses in 75 of 141 coronary arteries (53.2%) in 33 of 47 patients (70.2%). Cardiac MRI revealed perfusion defects in 30 of 47 patients (63.8%). Image quality of coronary CTA was diagnostic in 635 of 638 segments (99.5%). Coronary CTA revealed stenoses greater than 50% in 76 of 141 coronary arteries (53.9%) of 33 of 47 patients (70.2%). Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value, and accuracy of coronary CTA and perfusion-cardiac MRI versus CA and perfusion-cardiac MRI for the detection of hemodynamically relevant stenoses were 96.7%, 100%, 94.4%, 100%, and 97.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of coronary CTA and perfusion-cardiac MRI shows diagnostic performance comparable to that of CA and perfusion-cardiac MRI. Preliminary data suggest that coronary CTA may replace CA in the diagnosis of hemodynamically relevant CAD.",M2
20307205,"Large urban outbreak of orally acquired acute Chagas disease at a school in Caracas, Venezuela.BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi oral transmission is possible through food contamination by vector's feces. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical features of microepidemics of orally acquired acute Chagas disease (CD). METHODS: A case-control, cohort-nested, epidemiological study was conducted during an outbreak of acute CD that affected a school community. Structured interviews were designed to identify symptoms and sources of infection. Electrocardiograms were obtained for all patients. Specific serum antibodies were assessed by immunoenzimatic and indirect hemagglutination tests. In some cases, parasitemia was tested directly or by culture, animal inoculation, and/or a polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: Infection was confirmed in 103 of 1000 exposed individuals. Of those infected, 75% were symptomatic, 20.3% required hospitalization, 59% showed <e>ECG</e> abnormalities, parasitemia was documented in 44, and 1 child died. Clinical features differed from those seen in vectorial transmission. The infection rate was significantly higher among younger children. An epidemiological investigation incriminated contaminated fresh guava juice as the sole source of infection. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was unique, because it affected a large, urban, predominantly young, middle-class, otherwise healthy population and resulted in an unprecedented public health emergency. Rapid diagnosis and treatment avoided higher lethality. Food-borne transmission of T. cruzi may occur more often than is currently recognized.",M2

METHODS: Eight patients (5 males; age 59+/-2 years) with AF: 2 with persistent and 6 with paroxysmal (5 of them after unsuccessful RF ablation) with &gt;or=6 month follow-up after the procedure were included. One patient after myocardial infarction was treated with primary angioplasty with stent implantation. Another one had biatrial pacemaker. The procedure was performed with cryobaloon with 28 mm diameter (Arctic Front--Cryocath). After transseptal puncture mapping of the pulmonary vein ostia was performed with Lasso catheter (Johnson and Johnson). At each pulmonary vein ostium with pulmonary vein potentials 2 cryoapplications of 300 s duration was performed. Correct balloon placement before cryoapplication was checked using contrast injection into the pulmonary veins. During cryoapplication in the right pulmonary vein ostia permanent pacing of the phrenic nerve 30 beats per minute was performed to prevent its paralysis. After cryoapplications in all veins remapping with Lasso catheters was performed. In the absence of pulmonary vein potentials the procedure was finished, otherwise next cryoapplications were performed. During follow-up <e>ECG</e> was performed if any palpitations occurred, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed 1, 2 ,4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the procedure. A 2-month blanking period after the procedure was used. The lack of symptomatic AF and the absence of AF&gt;30 s on Holter ECG monitoring were defined as successful procedure. An improvement was defined as reduction of frequency/duration of AF paroxysm and reduction of the EHRA index&gt;or=1. RESULTS: During 8 procedures isolation of 31 pulmonary vein was performed. Procedure duration was 3.5+/-0.85 h, fluoroscopy time--33.55+/-15.44 min, and total cryoapplication time--38.33+/-4.1 min. There were no complications. After the follow-up of 8.5+/-0.99 months 6 (75%) patients were free from arrhythmia, including the patient after myocardial infarction and one patient with permanent AF prior ablation. In another patient an improvement was observed (EHRA score II/III to I) whereas in one patient with permanent AF the procedure was unsuccessful. CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation of pulmonary vein ostia is effective and safe, and can be an alternative to RF ablation. Easier procedure technique make possible shortening of the learning curve and increase the number of treated patients.",M2
20299797,"Atypical ST segment elevation and ventricular fibrillation without structural heart disease: a new electrocardiographic presentation of a channelopathy?Primary electrical syndromes are a group of rare inherited diseases that predispose to arrhythmias in the absence of structural abnormalities of the heart, and are associated with several ion channel mutations. Extrinsic factors, such as fever, may contribute to the development of electrical instability in these patients. We report the case of a 52-year-old patient who was admitted for syncope and had an in-hospital episode of ventricular fibrillation, who presented with an admission <e>ECG</e> showing marked precordial ST segment elevation (maximum 5 mm in V2). The patient did not have structural heart disease and during the hospital stay there was progressive ST segment normalization, with features suggestive of Brugada pattern. An automated defibrillator was implanted for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest. We believe that these findings may represent a new form of presentation of a genetic electrical syndrome.",M2

20230559,"Electrocardiography-guided and retrospective analysis of central venous catheter placement in the dog.OBJECTIVE: To compare the success rates of central venous catheter placement (CVCP) in dogs using electrocardiograph (<e>ECG</e>)-guided and external landmark ('blind') techniques. To report success rates determined retrospectively of CVCPs in dogs using external landmarks at a tertiary referral institution. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective blinded comparison of techniques. Retrospective analysis of case records. ANIMALS: Adult Beagles weighing 11.9 +/- 2.6 kg were used in the experimental group (n = 38). Various breeds of dogs were in the retrospective clinical group (n = 33). METHODS: Laboratory dogs were anesthetized and CVCPs were placed using a modified Seldinger technique. Catheter tip position was first based on external landmarks and then the catheter was repositioned using an ECG-guided placement. The ECG-guided technique used the V-lead with the positive electrode attached to the guide wire. Catheter placement was determined by moving the catheter cephalad and caudad to the point of maximum p-wave amplitude and then withdrawing the catheter 1-2 cm from this point. Catheter position with each technique was determined using a lateral thoracic radiograph. Retrospective data were collected from the medical records of dogs that had CVCPs using anatomical landmarks and corresponding thoracic radiographs. RESULTS: The number of successful CVCP attempts was the same for both prospective groups (21/38). There was no statistically significant difference in success between the ECG-guided technique and the blind technique. From the retrospective investigation 10/33 of the cases that fit the criteria had correct CVCPs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The odds of correctly placing a central venous catheter by ECG-guidance were the same as the external landmark technique. The ECG-guided technique may be useful in situations where external landmarks are not readily available.",M2
20229809,"[Evaluation of a simplified index (spectral entropy) about sleep state of electrocardiogram recorded by a simplified polygraph, MemCalc-Makin2]BACKGROUND: Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), but it takes time to analyze the PSG and PSG cannot be performed repeatedly because of efforts and costs. Therefore, simplified sleep respiratory disorder indices in which are reflected the PSG results are needed. The Memcalc method, which is a combination of the maximum entropy method for spectral analysis and the non-linear least squares method for fitting analysis (Makin2, Suwa Trust, Tokyo, Japan) has recently been developed. Spectral entropy which is derived by the Memcalc method might be useful to expressing the trend of time-series behavior. AIM: Spectral entropy of <e>ECG</e> which is calculated with the Memcalc method was evaluated by comparing to the PSG results. SUBJECTS: Obstructive SAS patients (n = 79) and control volanteer (n = 7) METHODS: ECG was recorded using MemCalc-Makin2 (GMS) with PSG recording using Alice IV (Respironics) from 20:00 to 6:00. Spectral entropy of ECG, which was calculated every 2 seconds using the Memcalc method, was compared to sleep stages which were analyzed manually from PSG recordings. RESULTS: Spectral entropy value (-0.473 vs. -0.418, p &lt; 0.05) were significantly increased in the OSAHS compared to the control. For the entropy cutoff level of -0.423, sensitivity and specificity for OSAHS were 86.1% and 71.4%, respectively, resulting in a receiver operating characteristic with an area under the curve of 0.837. The absolute value of entropy had inverse correlation with stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral entropy, which was calculated with Memcalc method, might be a possible index evaluating the quality of sleep.",M2
20225455,"Finding events of electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure signals via discrete wavelet transform with modified scales.A robust electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) wave detection-delineation algorithm that can be applied to all ECG leads is developed in this study on the basis of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). By applying a new simple approach to a selected scale obtained from DWT, this method is capable of detecting the QRS complex, P-wave, and T-wave as well as determining parameters such as start time, end time, and wave sign (upward or downward). In the proposed method, the selected scale is processed by a sliding rectangular window of length n and the curve length in each window is multiplied by the area under the absolute value of the curve. In the next step, an adaptive thresholding criterion is conducted on the resulted signal. The presented algorithm is applied to various databases including the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, European ST-T database, QT database, CinC Challenge 2008 database as well as high-resolution Holter data gathered in the DAY Hospital. As a result, the average values of sensitivity and positive prediction Se = 99.84 per cent and P+ = 99.80 per cent were obtained for the detection of QRS complexes with an average maximum delineation error of 13.7, 11.3, and 14.0 ms for the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave respectively. The presented algorithm has considerable capability in cases of a low signal-to-noise ratio, high baseline wander, and in cases where QRS complexes and T-waves appear with abnormal morphologies. Especially, the high capability of the algorithm in the detection of the critical points of the ECG signal, i.e. the beginning and end of the T-wave and the end of the QRS complex was validated by the cardiologist and the maximum values of 16.4 and 15.9 ms were recognized as absolute offset error of localization respectively. Finally, in order to illustrate an alternative capability of the algorithm, it is applied to all 18 subjects of the MIT-BIH polysomnographic database and the end-systolic and end-diastolic points of the blood pressure waveform were extracted and values of sensitivity and positive prediction Se = 99.80 per cent and P+ = 99.86 per cent were obtained for the detection of end-systolic, end-diastolic pulses.",M2
20223399,"Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: an ED-oriented algorithmic approach.The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist the clinician in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of the narrow complex tachycardia, we propose 3 separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information. The static algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions. The comparative algorithm requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared. The dynamic algorithm encourages the clinician to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism. Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either  yes  or  no  for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.",M2

The addition of a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) to a comprehensive personal and family history and physical examination will increase detection of those athletes with potentially lethal cardiovascular disorders at risk for sudden cardiac death. However, complex issues regarding feasibility, false positive results, cost-effectiveness, and physician and health system infrastructure still remain regarding large-scale implementation of ECG screening in the United States. When used, ECG interpretations based on modern criteria to distinguish abnormal findings from physiologic alterations in athletes must be applied to ensure acceptable accuracy.",M2

Because the impact of ECG screening on college athletes has rarely been reported, we analyzed the findings of adding the ECG to the PPE of Stanford athletes. DESIGN: For the past 15 years, the Stanford Sports Medicine program has mandated a PPE questionnaire and physical examination by Stanford physicians for participation in intercollegiate athletics. In 2007, computerized ECGs with digital measurements were recorded on athletes and entered into a database. SETTING: Although the use of standardized CV-focused history and physical examination are recommended for the PPE of athletes, the addition of the ECG has been controversial. Because the feasibility and outcomes of ECG screening on college athletes have rarely been reported, we present findings derived from the addition of the ECG to the PPE of Stanford athletes. For the past 15 years, the Stanford Sports Medicine program has mandated a PPE questionnaire and physical examination by Stanford physicians for participation in intercollegiate athletics. In 2007, computerized ECGs with digital measurements were recorded on athletes and entered into a database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six hundred fifty-eight recordings were obtained (54% men, 10% African-American, mean age 20 years) representing 24 sports. Although 68% of the women had normal ECGs, only 38% of the men did so. Incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (13%), right axis deviation (RAD) (10%), and atrial abnormalities (3%) were the 3 most common minor abnormalities. Sokolow-Lyon criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were found in 49%; however, only 27% had a Romhilt-Estes score of &gt;or=4. T-wave inversion in V2 to V3 occurred in 7%, and only 5 men had abnormal Q-waves. Sixty-three athletes (10%) were judged to have distinctly abnormal ECG findings possibly associated with conditions including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. These athletes were offered further testing but this was not mandated according to the research protocol.

Sixty-five athletes (10%) were judged to have distinctly abnormal ECG findings suggestive of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and/or biventricular hypertrophy. These athletes will be submitted to further testing. CONCLUSIONS: Mass ECG screening is achievable within the collegiate setting by using volunteers when the appropriate equipment is available. However, the rate of secondary testing suggests the need for an evaluation of cost-effectiveness for mass screening and the development of new athlete-specific ECG interpretation algorithms.",M2
20215841,"Fever-induced precordial ST-segment elevation in a young man.Brugada syndrome is a rare condition characterized by ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. Fever can induce Brugada-like electrocardiographic (<e>ECG</e>) changes. We reported on a 26-year-old male patient with fever and ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. Serial cardiac markers were normal and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal wall motion and no evidence for pericardial effusion. Brugada-like ECG changes disappeared after fever resolved. Since the patient had never experienced any arrhythmic symptom, syncope, or spontaneous type 1 ECG, electrophysiological study was not performed and he was not referred for defibrillator implantation. The patient was discharged with strong recommendations to avoid certain medications responsible for Brugada-like ECG changes and to receive urgent treatment for fever. He was asymptomatic during a year follow-up. Emphasis is placed on this particularly rare, but important condition, as it may easily be misdiagnosed and fever may even precipitate ventricular fibrillation.",M2
20212277,"Modeled economic evaluation of alternative strategies to reduce sudden cardiac death among children treated for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.BACKGROUND: Stimulants are widely used to treat children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and may increase the risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examined the cost-effectiveness of pretreatment screening with <e>ECG</e> for reducing SCD risk in children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder who are candidates for stimulant medication. Method and Results- We constructed a state-transition Markov model with 10 annual cycles spanning 7 to 17 years of age. Taking a societal perspective, we compared the cost-effectiveness of 3 screening strategies: (1) performing a history and physical examination with cardiology referral if abnormal (current standard of care); (2) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG after negative history and physical examination, with cardiology referral if either is abnormal; and (3) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG, with cardiology referral only if ECG is abnormal. Children identified with SCD-associated cardiac abnormalities would be restricted from stimulants and from playing competitive sports. The expected incremental cost-effectiveness over strategy 1 was $39,300 and $27,200 per quality-adjusted life-year for strategies 2 and 3, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation found that the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness was 55% for strategy 2 and 71% for strategy 3 (willingness to pay &lt; or =$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Both strategies 2 and 3 would avert 13 SCDs per 400,000 children seeking stimulant treatment for ADHD, for a cost of $1.6 million per life for strategy 2 and $1.2 million per life for strategy 3. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to current practice, adding ECG screening to history and physical examination pretreatment screening for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has borderline cost-effectiveness for preventing SCD. Relative cost-effectiveness may be improved by basing cardiology referral on ECG alone. Benefits of ECG screening arise primarily by restricting children identified with SCD risk from competitive sports.",M2
20210689,"Tirofiban for myocardial infarction.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Inhibition of platelet aggregation plays a key role in treatment of coronary artery disease. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Studies on the effects of tirofiban in patients with either ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction are reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Tirofiban is a small-molecule glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor. If discontinued, the action of tirofiban is faster reversed as abciximab. The dose varied between low (bolus of 0.4 microg/kg administered over 30 min followed by an infusion of 0.10 microg/kg/min), intermediate (bolus of 10 microg/kg administered over 3 min followed by an infusion of 0.15 microg/kg/min) and high (bolus of 25 microg/kg administered over 3 min followed by an infusion of 0.15 microg/kg/min). The high-dose administration especially may be beneficial in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is no indication for tirofiban in patients treated with thrombolysis. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction requiring PCI are most likely to benefit from tirofiban if they have ongoing ischemia and/or dynamic <e>ECG</e> changes. The risk of serious bleeding with tirofiban is low and there is a very low risk of thrombocytopenia. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Use of tirofiban for myocardial infarction is effective and has an acceptable safety profile.",M2
20208092,"Circadian variation in dominant atrial fibrillation frequency in persistent atrial fibrillation.Circadian variation in atrial fibrillation (AF) frequency is explored in this paper by employing recent advances in signal processing. Once the AF frequency has been estimated and tracked by a hidden Markov model approach, the resulting trend is analyzed for the purpose of detecting and characterizing the presence of circadian variation. With cosinor analysis, the results show that the short-term variations in the AF frequency exceed the variation that may be attributed to circadian. Using the autocorrelation method, circadian variation was found in 13 of 18 ambulatory <e>ECG</e> recordings (Holter) acquired from patients with long-standing persistent AF. Using the ensemble correlation method, the highest AF frequency usually occurred during the afternoon, whereas the lowest usually occurred during late night. It is concluded that circadian variation is present in most patients with long-standing persistent AF though the short-term variation in the AF frequency is considerable and should be taken into account.",M2

The electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) showed a fast irregular rhythm with wide polymorphic QRS tachycardia without the QRS twisting around the isoelectric baseline, diagnostic of AF and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient did not respond to intravenous amiodarone. Elective cardioversion restored sinus rhythm, and the ECG showed a wide QRS complex, short PR interval, and delta wave, indicating the presence of an accessory pathway and pre-excitation. AF was easily induced during the electrophysiologic study, requiring electrical cardioversion for severe hypotension. Successful radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway completely prevented further inducible AF.

Over a period of 2 years, 62 patients with OP poisoning were admitted to emergency department (ED) of Erciyes University Medical School Hospital. The age, sex, cause of contact, compound involved, time elapsed between exposure and admission to the ED, duration of hospital stay, and cardiac manifestations at the time of presentation were recorded. GCS and poisoning severity score (PSS) was calculated for each patient. Electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) analysis included the rate, rhythm, ST-T abnormalities, conduction defects, and measurement of PR and QT intervals. Sixty-two patients with OP poisoning presented to our ED from January 2007 to December 2008 from which 54 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 34.1 +/- 14.8 years. Of the cases, 53.7% were female. Twenty-six patients had a prolonged QTc interval. Mean PSS of men and women was 1.8 +/- 1.0. No statistically significant correlation was found between the PSS and QTc intervals of the cases. A significant correlation was determined between the GCS and PSS of grade 3 and grade 4 cases. GCS is a parameter that helps clinician to identify advanced grade OP poisoning patients in the initial assessment in the ED. However, ECG findings, such as prolonged QTc interval, are not effective in determination of short-term prognosis and show no relationship with PSS.",M2

METHODS: Two groups of patients were studied during invasive electrophysiological procedures for standard clinical indications. A normal group (n = 17) with supraventricular tachycardia, structurally normal hearts and no inducible ventricular arrhythmias (PES-) and an inducible group (n = 13) with inducible ventricular arrhythmias (PES+). In each patient, we delivered a series of S1-S2 pacing sequences with a baseline S2 of 500 ms, which was progressively reduced. At the same time, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) was recorded. T-waves were extracted from each ECG recording, and 12 different T-wave measures were obtained from each patient across a range of coupling intervals. These included conventional measures, and those obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) of repolarization waveforms. RESULTS: At baseline S2, there was no significant difference between the PES- and PES+ using conventional T-wave measures. There were significant differences at baseline S2 between groups using PCA-derived measures. These differences showed rate dependence and were larger at shorter coupling intervals. Two dynamic ECG measurements identified subjects who were inducible during PES; maximum relative T-wave residuum &gt;0.10 (odds ratio: 38.5, 95% CI: 4.7-318.5; P &lt; 0.001) and maximum T-wave shape index &lt;0.007 (odds ratio: 180.0, 95% CI: 10.2-3167.0; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: T-wave shape index is rate dependent and discriminates between PES- and PES+ patients. We propose that patients with inducible arrhythmias have rate-dependent heterogeneity of repolarization which could be a useful tool for risk stratification.",M2
20197434,"Imaging the pericardium: appearances on <e>ECG</e>-gated 64-detector row cardiac computed tomography.Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) with its high spatial and temporal resolution has now become an established and complementary method for cardiac imaging. It can now be used reliably to exclude significant coronary artery disease and delineate complex coronary artery anomalies, and has become a valuable problem-solving tool. Our experience with MDCT imaging suggests that it is clinically useful for imaging the pericardium. It is important to be aware of the normal anatomy of the pericardium and not mistake normal variations for pathology. The pericardial recesses are visible in up to 44% of non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated MDCT images. Abnormalities of the pericardium can now be identified with increasing certainty on 64-detector row CT; they may be the key to diagnosis and therefore must not be overlooked. This educational review of the pericardium will cover different imaging techniques, with a significant emphasis on MDCT. We have a large research and clinical experience of ECG-gated cardiac CT and will demonstrate examples of pericardial recesses, their variations and a wide variety of pericardial abnormalities and systemic conditions affecting the pericardium.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ECG plus cardiovascular-focused history and physical examination compared with cardiovascular-focused history and physical examination alone for preparticipation screening. DESIGN: Decision-analysis, cost-effectiveness model. DATA SOURCES: Published epidemiologic and preparticipation screening data, vital statistics, and other publicly available data. TARGET POPULATION: Competitive athletes in high school and college aged 14 to 22 years. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Nonparticipation in competitive athletic activity and disease-specific treatment for identified athletes with heart disease. OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental health care cost per life-year gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Addition of ECG to preparticipation screening saves 2.06 life-years per 1000 athletes at an incremental total cost of $89 per athlete and yields a cost-effectiveness ratio of $42 900 per life-year saved (95% CI, $21 200 to $71 300 per life-year saved) compared with cardiovascular-focused history and physical examination alone. Compared with no screening, ECG plus cardiovascular-focused history and physical examination saves 2.6 life-years per 1000 athletes screened and costs $199 per athlete, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of $76 100 per life-year saved ($62 400 to $130 000). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are sensitive to the relative risk reduction associated with nonparticipation and the cost of initial screening.

20194232,"Cardiovascular screening in college athletes with and without electrocardiography: A cross-sectional study.BACKGROUND: Although cardiovascular screening is recommended for athletes before participating in sports, the role of 12-lead electrocardiography (<e>ECG</e>) remains uncertain. To date, no prospective data that compare screening with and without ECG have been available. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of preparticipation screening limited to medical history and physical examination with a strategy that integrates these with ECG. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of screening strategies. SETTING: University Health Services, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: 510 collegiate athletes who received cardiovascular screening before athletic participation. MEASUREMENTS: Each participant had routine history and examination-limited screening and ECG. They received transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to detect or exclude cardiac findings with relevance to sports participation. The performance of screening with history and examination only was compared with that of screening that integrated history, examination, and ECG. RESULTS: Cardiac abnormalities with relevance to sports participation risk were observed on TTE in 11 of 510 participants (prevalence, 2.2%). Screening with history and examination alone detected abnormalities in 5 of these 11 athletes (sensitivity, 45.5% [95% CI, 16.8% to 76.2%]; specificity, 94.4% [CI, 92.0% to 96.2%]). Electrocardiography detected 5 additional participants with cardiac abnormalities (for a total of 10 of 11 participants), thereby improving the overall sensitivity of screening to 90.9% (CI, 58.7% to 99.8%). However, including ECG reduced the specificity of screening to 82.7% (CI, 79.1% to 86.0%) and was associated with a false-positive rate of 16.9% (vs. 5.5% for screening with history and examination only). LIMITATION: Definitive conclusions regarding the effect of ECG inclusion on sudden death rates cannot be made. CONCLUSION: Adding ECG to medical history and physical examination improves the overall sensitivity of preparticipation cardiovascular screening in athletes. However, this strategy is associated with an increased rate of false-positive results when current ECG interpretation criteria are used. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.",M2

Student t tests were used to compare groups within cohorts for significant differences. RESULTS: In the cohort of 470 TuCASA children, 50.3% were female, 41% were Hispanic; mean age (SD) was 8.7 (1.7) years. Hispanics and Caucasians did not differ significantly on mean sleeping heart rate. The CCSHS cohort consisted of 561 children; 50.2% female and 33% African American, aged 8.9 (0.6) years. African Americans had significantly faster sleeping heart rates than Caucasians in the CCSHS cohort. In both cohorts, younger children demonstrated significantly faster sleeping heart rates than older children; girls had significantly faster sleeping heart rates than boys (TuCASA: girls 77.6 [9.9] vs boys 73.6 [8.2]; CCHS: girls 81.5 [8.4] vs boys 78.4 [8.1]) and obese children (BMI &gt; or = 95th percentile for age) had significantly faster sleeping heart rates than nonobese children (TuCASA: obese children: 79.3 [12.3] vs nonobese children 75.0 [8.7]; CCHS: obese children: 83.3 [8.4] vs nonobese children 79.4 [8.31]). CONCLUSIONS: Children aged 6 to 11 years have sleeping heart rates that decrease significantly with age. African American ethnicity, female sex, and obesity were associated with faster sleeping heart rates.",M2
20189433,"Usefulness of routine electrocardiography for heart disease screening in patients with spondyloarthropathy or rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of routine electrocardiography for heart disease screening in patients with spondyloarthropathy (SpA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We included consecutive patients with SpA or RA or with degenerative joint disease (control group) admitted over a 6-month period and free of cardiovascular events. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (<e>ECG</e>) was obtained and was interpreted by a cardiologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 108 patients with SpA (mean duration, 11+/-10 years), 106 with RA (mean duration, 12+/-9 years), and 74 with degenerative joint disease (controls). No patient had cardiovascular symptoms or a prior history of cardiovascular disease. The only difference in cardiovascular risk factors across the three populations was a higher prevalence of diabetes in the RA and control groups. We found no differences between the SpA or RA groups and the control group regarding the rates of the following ECG findings: premature beats, atrioventricular block (2.8% in the SpA group, 1.9% in the RA group, and 2.7% in the control group), complete or incomplete left bundle branch block (0.9%, 0.9%, and 2.7%, respectively), complete right bundle branch bloc or left bundle branch block (0.9%, 4.7%, and 4.1%, respectively); and abnormalities suggesting myocardial ischemia (10.2%, 19.8%, and 17.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with SpA or RA who have no cardiovascular symptoms or history of cardiovascular disease, a routine ECG shows no increase in the cardiac abnormalities specifically associated with these joint diseases, compared to controls with degenerative joint disease.",M2
20178971,"[A new <e>ECG</e> marker of anterior acute myocardial infarction]ST-segment elevation is the hallmark of acute transmural myocardial ischemia caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery. ST-segment elevation is the major criterion for the patients with chest pain to immediate reperfusion therapy. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanism of ST-elevation remains unclear. Two patients are reported with proximal left anterior descending coronary occlusion but without ST-segment elevation. The distinct ECG patterns were tall, with symmetrical T-waves and upsloping and digoxin-like ST-segment depression. Patients with these ECG patterns need immediate coronary intervention.",M2

20176985,"Ethnic differences in physiological cardiac adaptation to intense physical exercise in highly trained female athletes.BACKGROUND: Ethnicity is an important determinant of cardiovascular adaptation in athletes. Studies in black male athletes reveal a higher prevalence of electric repolarization and left ventricular hypertrophy than observed in white males; these frequently overlap with those observed in cardiomyopathy and have important implications in the preparticipation cardiac screening era. There are no reports on cardiac adaptation in highly trained black females, who comprise an increasing population of elite competitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, 240 nationally ranked black female athletes (mean age 21+/-4.6 years old) underwent 12-lead <e>ECG</e> and 2-dimensional echocardiography. The results were compared with 200 white female athletes of similar age and size participating in similar sports. Black athletes demonstrated greater left ventricular wall thickness (9.2+/-1.2 versus 8.6+/-1.2 mm, P&lt;0.001) and left ventricular mass (187.2+/-42 versus 172.3+/-42 g, P=0.008) than white athletes. Eight black athletes (3%) exhibited a left ventricular wall thickness &gt;11 mm (12 to 13 mm) compared with none of the white athletes. All athletes revealed normal indices of systolic and diastolic function. Black athletes exhibited a higher prevalence of T-wave inversions (14% versus 2%, P&lt;0.001) and ST-segment elevation (11% versus 1%, P&lt;0.001) than white athletes. Deep T-wave inversions (-0.2 mV) were observed only in black athletes and were confined to the anterior leads (V(1) through V(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic physical exercise in black female athletes is associated with greater left ventricular hypertrophy and higher prevalence of repolarization changes than in white female athletes of similar age and size participating in identical sporting disciplines. However, a maximal left ventricular wall thickness &gt;13 mm or deep T-wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads are rare and warrant further investigation.",M2
20173162,"Nonenhanced free-breathing <e>ECG</e>-gated steady-state free precession 3D MR angiography of the renal arteries: comparison between 1.5 T and 3 T.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to compare the image quality of free-breathing ECG-gated nonenhanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) MR angiography of renal arteries at 1.5 T and 3 T. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty volunteers (11 men, nine women; mean age, 23.2 +/- 2.3 years) without a history of renovascular disease participated in the study. Nonenhanced SSFP MR angiography was performed on all subjects at both 1.5 T and 3 T with a maximum interval of 2 weeks between the imaging sessions. The subjective image quality of axial and coronal maximum-intensity-projection reconstructions of four segments (1, abdominal aorta and ostium of renal artery; 2, main renal artery; 3, segmental branches outside renal parenchyma; 4, segmental branches inside renal parenchyma) was evaluated independently by two radiologists using a 4-point scale (4, excellent; 1, nondiagnostic). Relative signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and maximum visible vessel length of the right and left renal arteries also were determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in image quality at 1.5 T and 3 T was found for segments 1 and 2. The mean image quality for segments 3 and 4 was significantly greater at 3 T (3.88 +/- 0.32, 3.17 +/- 0.70) than at 1.5 T (3.32 +/- 0.73, 2.09 +/- 0.81) (p &lt; 0.001). At 3 T, the maximal vessel length of the right (9.85 +/- 0.82 cm) and left (8.3 +/- 0.79 cm) renal arteries was significantly greater than at 1.5 T (8.94 +/- 1.38 cm and 7.58 +/- 1.18 cm, respectively). CONCLUSION: Performing nonenhanced SSFP MR angiography at 3 T significantly improves visualization of peripheral renal arterial segments in healthy subjects as compared to 1.5 T.",M2
20173133,"Right ventricular involvement in acute left ventricular myocardial infarction: prognostic implications of MRI findings.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic importance of the cardiac MRI finding of right ventricular involvement in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients (41 men, nine women; mean age, 58 +/- 11 years) with first-ST-segment elevation MI underwent 1.5-T cardiac MRI immediately after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. The cardiac MRI protocol included steady-state free precession cine sequences for functional assessment of the left, right, and both ventricles and inversion recovery FLASH delayed enhancement sequences after contrast administration for the quantification of myocardial damage. The prevalence of right ventricular involvement detected with <e>ECG</e> and echocardiography was compared with the prevalence detected with cardiac MRI, which was the reference standard. Patients underwent follow-up for 32 +/- 8 months. RESULTS: Right ventricular involvement was diagnosed with cardiac MRI in 27 patients (54%): 14 of 30 patients (47%) with inferior ST-segment elevation MI and 13 of 20 patients (65%) with anterior ST-segment elevation MI. ECG and echocardiographic findings showed only moderate agreement with cardiac MRI findings in the detection of right ventricular involvement in inferior acute MI (kappa = 0.38). Patients with right ventricular involvement in anterior ST-segment elevation MI had larger infarcts (delayed enhancement, 25.9% +/- 14.5% vs 11.4% +/- 10.1%; p = 0.030), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (34.3% +/- 8.2% vs 45.2% +/- 9.5%; p &lt; 0.015), and lower right ventricular ejection fraction (39.8% +/- 6.6% vs 54.9% +/- 8.8%; p &lt; 0.001) than those without right ventricular involvement. In a multivariate logistic regression model, right ventricular involvement was a strong independent predictor (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 4-63%) of major cardiac adverse events. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular involvement in ST-segment elevation MI is detected more frequently with cardiac MRI than with ECG and echocardiography and is an independent prognostic indicator.",M2
20173131,"Mitral valve prolapse: evaluation with <e>ECG</e>-gated cardiac CT angiography.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of detecting mitral valve prolapse with ECG-gated 64-MDCT angiography in comparison with the reference standard, transthoracic echocardiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of patients consecutively referred for clinically indicated 64-MDCT angiography were reviewed. The study cohort consisted of patients who had undergone transthoracic echocardiography. Two experienced radiologists performed blinded consensus review of the MDCT angiograms of 20 patients, and the findings were compared with those of transthoracic echocardiography, which was the reference standard. RESULTS: With the findings on each anterior and posterior leaflet as separate data points, sensitivity was calculated to be 69.2-84.6% and specificity, 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were estimated to be 100% and 87.0-93.1%. CONCLUSION: ECG-gated cardiac 64-MDCT angiography can be used reliably to detect mitral valve prolapse.",M2
20177833,"Clinical significance of ischemic electrocardiographic changes during stress myocardial perfusion imaging: sub-analysis of the J-ACCESS study.OBJECTIVES: The cardiac event rate among the countries varies according to ethnicity. Some reports have identified that ischemic heart disease often occurs at a low incidence and is often milder in Japan compared to other countries. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the clinical significance and prediction for cardiac events in patients who showed ischemic <e>ECG</e> changes during stress myocardial perfusion SPECT. METHODS: Among 4,670 registered patients for Japanese-assessment of cardiac event and survival (J-ACCESS) study, patients with conduction abnormality on baseline were excluded and revascularization within 60 days of SPECT study were censored from the prognostic portion of analysis. Stress and rest myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin were performed and occurrence and nature of cardiac events were investigated at 1, 2 and 3 years after registration. Both PCI and CABG, as well as recurrent angina and non-severe heart failure were classified as soft events. Cardiac death, non-fatal MI and heart failure requiring hospitalization were classified as major cardiac events, and hard events comprised cardiac death and non-fatal MI. RESULTS: A total of 3,125 patients performed exercise (n = 2,383) or vasodilator (n = 742) stress MPI and significant ischemic ECG changes were obtained in 538 during exercise and 35 during vasodilator stress. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with both ischemic ECG changes and reversible perfusion defect on MPI had significantly higher incidence for major cardiac events, such as cardiac death, non-fatal MI and severe heart failure (P = 0.0038), and for cardiac hard events, such as cardiac death and non-fatal MI (P = 0.0028), in exercise stress. Interestingly, patients without reversible perfusion defect showed significantly fewer events despite presence of ischemic ECG changes. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic ECG changes during exercise stress are well associated with higher incidence of cardiac events in patients demonstrated reversible perfusion defect on MPI.",M2
20177387,"Reduction of X-ray induced DNA double-strand breaks in blood lymphocytes during coronary CT angiography using high-pitch spiral data acquisition with prospective <e>ECG</e>-triggering.OBJECTIVES: Purpose of this study was to compare the effect of high-pitch spiral data acquisition with prospective electrocardiography (ECG)-triggering on the x-ray induced DNA damages to blood lymphocytes with commonly used low-pitch spiral scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty four patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography either using high-pitch spiral data acquisition (n = 15; dual-source computed tomography (CT) scanner, 38.4 mm collimation, 100-120 kV, 320-456 mAs/rotation, pitch value 3.2-3.4) or using a low-pitch protocol (n = 19; dual-source CT scanner, 19.2 mm collimation, 120 kV, 330-438 mAs/rotation, pitch 0.2-0.39, ECG-based tube current modulation). Blood samples were obtained before and 30 minutes after CT. Lymphocytes were isolated, stained against the phosphorylated histone variant gammaH2AX, and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Radiation dose to the blood was estimated by relating in vivo DSB levels to values of in vitro irradiated blood samples (50 mGy). Dose length product was registered as provided by the patient protocol. RESULTS: Total dose length product ranged from 101 to 237 (median 112) mGy cm in high-pitch and from 524 to 1283 (median 1025) mGy cm in low-pitch scans (P &lt; 0.0001). The median CT induced DSB level 30 minutes after exposure was significantly lower after high-pitch (0.04 DSBs/cell, range 0.02-0.10 DSBs/cell) compared with low-pitch scans (0.39 DSBs/cell, 0.22-0.71 DSBs/cell, P &lt; 0.0001). Both DSB levels and radiation dose to the blood showed a significant correlation to the dose length product (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.0001). The radiation dose to the blood was significantly reduced in the high-pitch (median 3.1, range 2.0-8.1 mGy) compared with the low-pitch group (median 26.9; range 14.2-44.9 mGy, P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral data acquisition can considerably reduce the radiation dose to the blood in coronary CT angiography as compared with low pitch protocols.",M2
