20007760,"Prevalence of trimethoprim resistance genes in Escherichia coli isolates of human and animal origin in Lithuania.A total of 456 non-repetitive Escherichia coli isolates from human clinical specimens (urinary, n=134; cervix, vagina and prostate, n=52; blood, pus and wounds, n=45), healthy animals (cattle, n=45; poultry, n=20) and diseased animals (cattle, n=53; swine, n=64; poultry, n=43) obtained in Lithuania during the period 2005-2008 were studied for trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) resistance and the prevalence of dfr genes. A TMP resistance rate in the range of 18-26 % respective to the origin was found in clinical isolates, 23-40 % in isolates from diseased animals and 9-20 % in isolates from healthy animals. Of 112 TMP-resistant isolates, 103 carried at least one of the six dfrA genes (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA8, dfrA12, dfrA14 and dfrA17) as determined by multiplex PCR and RFLP. The dfrA1 and dfrA17 genes were found most frequently in clinical isolates (17 and 19 isolates, respectively), whilst dfrA1 and dfrA14 genes dominated in isolates of animal origin (25 and 13 isolates, respectively). The dfrA5, dfrA12 and dfrA8 genes were detected at lower frequencies. The association with class 1/class 2 integrons was confirmed for 73-100 % of dfr genes found in most groups of isolates, except for the isolates from diseased swine. In this group, the majority of dfr-positive isolates (67 %, 8/12) carried dfrA8 (6/12) or dfrA14 genes (2/12) that were not associated with integrons. Non-integron location was also confirmed for the remaining dfrA8 genes (six clinical isolates and one isolate from diseased cattle) and for dfrA14 genes (two isolates from diseased cattle and swine each). All cassette-independent dfrA14 genes were found to be located within the strA gene. This study on the prevalence and distribution of TMP resistance genes among E. coli isolates of human and animal origin in Lithuania demonstrates that dfr genes are carried most frequently as gene cassettes within class 1 and/or class 2 integrons. However, TMP resistance in some of the isolates was found to be mediated by non-integron-associated dfrA8 and dfrA14 genes, indicating the existence of alternative sources for the spread of resistance.",M1
19950924,"Kinetic and structural characterization of dihydrofolate reductase from Streptococcus pneumoniae.Drug resistance associated with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has emerged as a critical issue in the treatment of bacterial infections. In our efforts to understand the mechanism of a drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from a pathogenic bacterial source, we report the first kinetic characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae DHFR (spDHFR) along with its X-ray structure. This study revealed that the kinetic properties of spDHFR were significantly different from those of Escherichia coli DHFR. The product (tetrahydrofolate) dissociation step that is the rate-limiting step in E. coli DHFR is significantly accelerated in spDHFR so that hydride transfer or a preceding step is rate-limiting. Comparison of the binding parameters of this enzyme to those of a mutant spDHFR (Sp9) confirmed that the Leu100 residue in spDHFR is the critical element for the trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) resistance. Steady-state kinetics exhibited a pH dependence in k(cat), which prompted us to elucidate the role of the new catalytic residue (His33) in the active site of spDHFR. Structural data of the Sp9 mutant in complex with NADPH and methotrexate confirmed the participation of His33 in a hydrogen bonding network involving a water molecule, the hydroxyl group of Thr119, and the carboxylate ion of Glu30. Sequence analysis of the DHFR superfamily revealed that the His residue is the major amino acid component at this position and is found mostly in pathogenic bacterial DHFRs. A mutation of Val100 to Leu demonstrated a steric clash of the leucine side chain with the side chains of Ile8 and Phe34, rationalizing weaker binding of trimethoprim to Leu100 DHFR. Understanding the role of specific amino acids in the active site coupled with detailed structural analysis will inform us on how to better design inhibitors targeting drug-resistant pathogenic bacterial DHFRs.",M1
19854343,"A multidimensional high performance liquid chromatography method coupled with amperometric detection using a boron-doped diamond electrode for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in bovine milk.The development and validation of a multidimensional HPLC method using an on-line clean-up column coupled with amperometric detection employing a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) in bovine milk are presented. Aliquots of pre-prepared skim-milk samples were directly injected into a RAM octyl-BSA column in order to remove proteins that otherwise would interfere with milk analysis. After exclusion of the milk proteins, SMX and TMP were transferred to the analytical column (an octyl column) and the separation of the compounds from one another and from other endogenous milk components was achieved. SMX and TMP were detected amperometrically at 1.25V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0molL(-1) KCl). Results with good linearity in the concentration ranges 50-800 and 25-400microgL(-1) for SMX and TMP, respectively, were obtained and no fouling of the BDD electrode was observed within the experimental period of several hours. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10% for both drugs and the obtained LOD values for SMX and TMP were 25.0 and 15.0microgL(-1), respectively.",M1
19804872,"Improved trimethoprim-resistance cassette for prokaryotic selections.Many of the antibiotic resistance elements used in molecular biology have idiosyncratic limitations. For example, beta-lactam selections rely on antibiotics that are unstable to hydrolysis and allow satellite colonies to form upon extended incubation, and tetracycline selections typically give rise to widely varying colony sizes and lower transformation efficiencies. Although prokaryotic Type II dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes have long been considered to have potential utility for the selection of plasmids and mobile elements in bacteria, practical limitations to the quality of those selections, mostly relating to background and inefficiency, have led for the most part to their underuse. I describe here the construction of a Type IIa dfr prokaryotic expression cassette that confers strong resistance against trimethoprim (<e>Tmp</e>), a bactericidal dfr inhibiting antibiotic. The Tmp-resistance cassette provides consistent and efficient selections and plasmid transformation frequencies equivalent to those encountered with beta-lactamases.",M1
19762032,"Development and validation of a normal-phase high-performance thin layer chromatographic method for the analysis of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in co-trimoxazole tablets.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is often the ultimate mortal cause for immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV/AIDS patients. Currently, the most effective medicine for treatment and prophylaxis is co-trimoxazole, a synergistic combination of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>). In order to ensure a continued availability of high quality co-trimoxazole tablets within resource-limited countries, Medicines Regulatory Authorities must perform quality control of these products. However, most pharmacopoeial methods are based on high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods. Because of the lack of equipment, the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) laboratory decided to develop and validate an alternative method of analysis based on the TLC technique with densitometric detection, for the routine quality control of co-trimoxazole tablets. SMX and TMP were separated on glass-backed silica gel 60 F(254) plates in a high-performance thin layer chromatograph (HPTLC). The mobile phase was comprised of toluene, ethylacetate and methanol (50:28.5:21.5, v:v:v). Detection wavelength was 254 nm. The R(f) values were 0.30 and 0.61 for TMP and SMX, respectively. This method was validated for linearity, precision, trueness, specificity and robustness. Cochran's criterion test indicated homoscedasticity of variances for the calibration data. The F-tests for lack-of-fit indicated that straight lines were adequate to describe the relationship between spot areas and concentrations for each compound. The percentage relative standard deviations for repeatability and time-different precisions were 0.98 and 1.32, and 0.83 and 1.64 for SMX and TMP, respectively. Percentage recovery values were 99.00%+/-1.83 and 99.66%+/-1.21 for SMX and TMP, respectively. The method was found to be robust and was then successfully applied to analyze co-trimoxazole tablet samples.",M1
19622858,"Inhibitory properties and X-ray crystallographic study of the binding of AR-101, AR-102 and iclaprim in ternary complexes with NADPH and dihydrofolate reductase from Staphylococcus aureus.Iclaprim is a novel dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor belonging to the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine class of antibiotics, of which trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) is the most well known representative. Iclaprim exhibits potent bactericidal activity against major Gram-positive pathogens, notably methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) phenotypes, including TMP-resistant strains. The inhibition properties of racemic iclaprim and of the two enantiomers, termed AR-101 and AR-102, towards S. aureus wild-type DHFR and TMP-resistant F98Y mutant DHFR were determined and compared. Similar to TMP, AR-101, AR-102 and iclaprim are all competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrate dihydrofolate. Iclaprim, AR-101 and AR-102 demonstrated little or no difference in activity towards these enzymes and were significantly more potent than TMP. The crystal structures of S. aureus DHFR and F98Y mutant DHFR were determined as ternary complexes with NADPH and either AR-101, AR-102 or iclaprim. The binding modes of the inhibitors were analysed and compared. The X-ray crystallographic data explain the binding modes of all molecules well and can be used to rationalize the equipotent affinity of AR-101, AR-102 and iclaprim, which is also reflected in their antibacterial properties.",M1
19620336,"Dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) for melioidosis.Melioidosis is an infectious disease with a propensity for relapse, despite prolonged antibiotic eradication therapy for 12 to 20 weeks. A pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation study was performed to determine the optimal dosing of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [<e>TMP</e>-SMX]) used in current eradication regimens in Thailand and Australia. Data for bioavailability, protein binding, and coefficients of absorption and elimination were taken from published literature. Apparent volumes of distribution were correlated with body mass and were estimated separately for Thai and Australian populations. In vitro experiments demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. In Australia, the currently used eradication regimen (320 [TMP]/1,600 [SMX] mg every 12 h [q12h]) was predicted to achieve the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) target (an area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h/MIC ratio of &gt;25 for both TMP and SMX) for strains with the MIC90 of Australian strains (&lt; or = 1/19 mg/liter). In Thailand, the former regimen of 160/800 mg q12h would not be expected to attain the target for strains with an MIC of &gt; or = 1/19 mg/liter, but the recently implemented weight-based regimen (&lt;40 kg [body weight], 160/800 mg q12h; 40 to 60 kg, 240/1,200 mg q12h; &gt;60 kg, 320/1,600 mg q12h) would be expected to achieve adequate concentrations for strains with an MIC of &lt; or = 1/19 mg/liter. The results were sensitive to the variance of the PK parameters. Prospective PK-PD studies of Asian populations are needed to optimize TMP-SMX dosing in melioidosis.",M1
19528269,"In vitro activity of antifolate and polymorphism in dihydrofolate reductase of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Kenyan coast: emergence of parasites with Ile-164-Leu mutation.We have analyzed the activities of the antifolates pyrimethamine (PM), chlorcycloguanil (CCG), WR99210, trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), methotrexate (MTX), and trimetrexate (TMX) against Kenyan Plasmodium falciparum isolates adapted in vitro for long-term culture. We have also assessed the relationship between these drug activities and mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), a domain of the gene associated with antifolate resistance. As expected, WR99210 was the most potent drug, with a median 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of &lt;0.075 nM, followed by TMX, with a median IC50 of 30 nM. The median IC50 of CCG was 37.80 nM, and that of MTX was 83.60 nM. PM and TMP were the least active drugs, with median IC50s of 733.26 nM and 29,656.04 nM, respectively. We analyzed parasite dhfr genotypes by the PCR-enzyme restriction technique. No wild-type dhfr parasite was found. Twenty-four of 33 parasites were triple mutants (mutations at codons 108, 51, and 59), and only 8/33 were double mutants (mutations at codons 108 and 51 or at codons 108 and 59). IC50s were 2.1-fold (PM) and 3.6-fold (TMP) higher in triple than in double mutants, though these differences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, we have identified a parasite harboring a mutation at codon 164 (Ile-164-Leu) in addition to mutations at codons 108, 51, and 59. This quadruple mutant parasite had the highest TMP IC50 and was in the upper 10th percentile against PM and CCG. We confirmed the presence of this mutation by sequencing. Thus, TMX and MTX are potent against P. falciparum, and quadruple mutants are now emerging in Africa.",M1
19492849,"An in vivo covalent <e>TMP</e>-tag based on proximity-induced reactivity.Chemical tags for live cell imaging are emerging as viable alternatives to the fluorescent proteins for labeling proteins with small molecule probes. Among reported chemical tags, trimethoprim (TMP)-tag stands out for having sufficient cell permeability and selectivity to allow imaging of intracellular proteins. TMP-tag provides a noncovalent label in which the protein of interest is fused to E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and then labeled with a cell-permeable TMP-probe heterodimer. To complement the utility of the noncovalent TMP-tag, we sought to render the TMP-tag covalent for applications such as single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase labeling that would benefit from a more permanent modification. On the basis of the long-standing use of proximity-induced reactivity for irreversible inhibitor design and its more recent application to in vitro chemical biology tools, we designed an eDHFR variant with a unique cysteine residue positioned to react with an acrylamide electrophile installed on the TMP-probe label. In vitro experiments show that the eDHFR:L28C nucleophile reacts rapidly and quantitatively with the TMP-acrylamide-probe. Most significantly, the balance in reactivity provided by the acrylamide electrophile allows intracellular proteins tagged with eDHFR:L28C to be labeled with a TMP-acrylamide-fluorescein heterotrimer in live cells with minimal background. Thus, the TMP electrophile described here can be used immediately as a covalent chemical tag in live cells. Moreover, proximity-induced reactivity is shown to be sufficiently selective for use in a living cell, suggesting a general approach for the development of orthogonal covalent chemical tags from existing noncovalent ligand-protein pairs.",M1
19481616,"A multi-biomarker assessment of the impact of the antibacterial trimethoprim on the non-target organism Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha).A battery of eight biomarkers was applied in the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha to evaluate potential sub-lethal effects of the antimicrobial trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>, 5-[3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine). Mussels were exposed for 96 h to increasing concentrations (1, 3, 10 nM) of TMP in in vivo experiments. We determined the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, the micronucleus test (MN test), the apoptotic frequency (Halo assay) and the lysosomal membrane stability (Neutral Red Retention Assay) in mussel hemocytes. Moreover, to reveal whether the oxidative status was altered, measurements of the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) were performed using the cytosolic fraction extracted from a pool of entire mussels. The biomarker battery pointed out only a moderate cyto- and genotoxicity on Zebra mussel hemocytes since only a slight increase in DNA damage was registered by apoptosis induction and MN frequency, while significant differences of lysosomal membrane stability from baseline levels were measured at 3 and 10 nM at the end of exposures only. Finally, TMP seems to have a very low induction capability or even an inhibitory effect on the activities of antioxidant enzymes, but a clear significant induction on GST.",M1
19327455,"Preparation of alumina-coated magnetite nanoparticle for extraction of trimethoprim from environmental water samples based on mixed hemimicelles solid-phase extraction.In this study, a new type of alumina-coated magnetite nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) NPs) modified by the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) has been successfully synthesized and applied for extraction of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) from environmental water samples based on mixed hemimicelles solid-phase extraction (MHSPE). The coating of alumina on Fe(3)O(4) NPs not only avoids the dissolving of Fe(3)O(4) NPs in acidic solution, but also extends their application without sacrificing their unique magnetization characteristics. Due to the high surface area of these new sorbents and the excellent adsorption capacity after surface modification by SDS, satisfactory concentration factor and extraction recoveries can be produced with only 0.1g Fe(3)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) NPs. Main factors affecting the adsolubilization of TMP such as the amount of SDS, pH value, standing time, desorption solvent and maximal extraction volume were optimized. Under the selected conditions, TMP could be quantitatively extracted. The recoveries of TMP by analyzing the four spiked water samples were between 67 and 86%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 2 to 6%. Detection and quantification limits of the proposed method were 0.09 and 0.24 microg L(-1), respectively. Concentration factor of 1000 was achieved using this method to extract 500 mL of different environmental water samples. Compared with conventional SPE methods, the advantages of this new Fe(3)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) NPs MHSPE method still include easy preparation and regeneration of sorbents, short times of sample pretreatment, high extraction yields, and high breakthrough volumes. It shows great analytical potential in preconcentration of organic compounds from large volume water samples.",M1
19280600,"Structural comparison of chromosomal and exogenous dihydrofolate reductase from Staphylococcus aureus in complex with the potent inhibitor trimethoprim.Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is the enzyme responsible for the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5,6-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor in the synthesis of purines, thymidylate, methionine, and other key metabolites. Because of its importance in multiple cellular functions, DHFR has been the subject of much research targeting the enzyme with anticancer, antibacterial, and antimicrobial agents. Clinically used compounds targeting DHFR include methotrexate for the treatment of cancer and diaminopyrimidines (DAPs) such as trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) for the treatment of bacterial infections. DAP inhibitors of DHFR have been used clinically for &gt;30 years and resistance to these agents has become widespread. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the causative agent of many serious nosocomial and community acquired infections, and other gram-positive organisms can show resistance to DAPs through mutation of the chromosomal gene or acquisition of an alternative DHFR termed  S1 DHFR.  To develop new therapies for health threats such as MRSA, it is important to understand the molecular basis of DAP resistance. Here, we report the crystal structure of the wild-type chromosomal DHFR from S. aureus in complex with NADPH and TMP. We have also solved the structure of the exogenous, TMP resistant S1 DHFR, apo and in complex with TMP. The structural and thermodynamic data point to important molecular differences between the two enzymes that lead to dramatically reduced affinity of DAPs to S1 DHFR. These differences in enzyme binding affinity translate into reduced antibacterial activity against strains of S. aureus that express S1 DHFR.",M1
19269673,"The toxicity of sulfamethazine to Daphnia magna and its additivity to other veterinary sulfonamides and trimethoprim.Sulfonamides (SAs), the oldest chemotherapeutic agents used for antimicrobial therapy, still play an important role in veterinary mass treatments. Consequently, traces of these compounds, alone or in combinations, have been repeatedly detected in the environment. Sulfamethazine (SMZ) deserves particular attention not only because it is the most used veterinary SA, but also due to its proven effects on fertility in mice and on thyroid hormone homeostasis in rats. In this study, after evaluating the acute toxicity to Daphnia magna of six veterinary SAs and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), the additivity of SMZ to each other compound was tested using the isobologram method. Two reproduction tests on the same biological model were also performed in order to derive LOEC and NOEC of SMZ. The acute EC(50) was in the range 131-270 mgL(-1) for all the compounds tested with the exception of sulfaguanidine (EC(50)=3.86 mgL(-1)). In acute binary tests SMZ showed a complex interaction with sulfaquinoxaline (superadditivity, additivity or subadditivity) at the three different combination ratios tested, simple additivity to TMP and less than additive interaction when paired to the other SAs. LOEC and NOEC of SMZ obtained from reproduction tests were 3.125 and 1.563 mgL(-1), respectively. In conclusion, SMZ should not harm the crustacean population at environmentally realistic concentrations. Its toxicity is comparable to that of other systemic SAs, and their binary interactions are less than additive. The same can not be entirely said for enteric SAs, and considering that these compounds are administered at high doses and mostly excreted in unmetabolised form, further evaluation of their impact to the aquatic environment seems advisable.",M1
19249312,"Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase reveal an alternate conformation of NADPH that may be linked to trimethoprim resistance.Both hospital- and community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infections have become major health concerns in terms of morbidity, suffering and cost. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMZ) is an alternative treatment for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. However, TMP-resistant strains have arisen with point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the target for TMP. A single point mutation, F98Y, has been shown biochemically to confer the majority of this resistance to TMP. Using a structure-based approach, we have designed a series of novel propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors that are active against several trimethoprim-resistant enzymes. We screened this series against wild-type and mutant (F98Y) S. aureus DHFR and found that several are active against both enzymes and specifically that the meta-biphenyl class of these inhibitors is the most potent. In order to understand the structural basis of this potency, we determined eight high-resolution crystal structures: four each of the wild-type and mutant DHFR enzymes bound to various propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors. In addition to explaining the structure-activity relationships, several of the structures reveal a novel conformation for the cofactor, NADPH. In this new conformation that is predominantly associated with the mutant enzyme, the nicotinamide ring is displaced from its conserved location and three water molecules complete a network of hydrogen bonds between the nicotinamide ring and the protein. In this new position, NADPH has reduced interactions with the inhibitor. An equilibrium between the two conformations of NADPH, implied by their occupancies in the eight crystal structures, is influenced both by the ligand and the F98Y mutation. The mutation induced equilibrium between two NADPH-binding conformations may contribute to decrease TMP binding and thus may be responsible for TMP resistance.",M1
19232398,"Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of in vitro exposure to triclosan and trimethoprim on zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) hemocytes.Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in several aquatic ecosystems for a number of years, but the potential for biological effects in exposed non-target organisms is only now being reported. In this study the potential cellular damage due to two of the main PPCPs found in aquatic environments was investigated by in vitro exposures. Hemolymph samples of the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha were collected and treated with increasing concentrations of the antibacterial agent Triclosan (TCS) and the antibiotic Trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>). Doses selected for TCS were 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 microM, while 0.2, 1, and 5 microM for TMP exposures, respectively. We evaluated the potential genotoxicity on hemocytes by the SCGE (single cell gel electrophoresis) assay and apoptosis frequency evaluation, while the cytotoxicity was measured by the lysosomal membranes stability test (NRRA, neutral red retention assay). TCS genotoxicity increased in a dose-dependent manner and this pharmaceutical significantly affects hemocyte functionality due to severe DNA injuries at very low doses. In contrast, TMP seems to be less dangerous than TCS for D. polymorpha because the cytotoxic and the moderate genotoxic effects noticed were obtained only at very high concentration levels.",M1
19096873,"Tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli strains are inherited from parents and persist in the infant's intestines in the absence of selective pressure.The study investigated tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP), cefazolin (CEF), and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) resistance in Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the feces of 21 infants up to 6 months of age and in their parents in the absence of selective antimicrobial pressure. Clonality of strains was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Three infants had resistant E. coli strains in their feces identical to the mothers' from week 1 on, which persisted over weeks. From week 2 on, in another four infants, persisting resistant E. coli were found, two of them identical to the mothers'. All of these persisting E. coli strains (except one family) showed at least resistance to TC. In infants, resistant E. coli strains inherited from their mothers tended to persist over months. Therefore, the persistence of resistant E. coli and their possible capacity to cause symptomatic infection or transfer its resistance genes to other bacteria deserves more attention.",M1
18816075,"Trimethoprim: novel reactive intermediates and bioactivation pathways by cytochrome p450s.Trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) is a widely used antibacterial agent that is usually considered as a safe drug. TMP has, however, been implicated in rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in humans. Bioactivation to a reactive iminoquinone methide intermediate has been proposed as a possible cause for the toxicity of the drug. However, little is known about the cytochrome P450s (P450s) involved in this bioactivation and in the metabolism of TMP in general. In this study, we have investigated the metabolism and bioactivation of TMP by human liver microsomes (HLM) and rat liver microsomes, by recombinant human cytochrome P450s, and by the bacterial P450 BM3 mutant M11(his). In addition to non GSH-dependent metabolites, five GSH adducts were identified in the HLM incubations. Next to two major GSH adducts probably originating from the iminoquinone methide intermediate described previously, three minor GSH adducts were also identified, indicating that other types of reactive intermediates are formed by HLM, such as ortho-quinones and para-quinone methide intermediates. The major GSH adducts were produced by P450 1A2 and P450 3A4, while the minor GSH adducts were mainly formed by P450 1A2, P450 3A4, and P450 2D6. Although preliminary, these results might implicate that genetic polymorphisms in P450 enzymes could play a role in the onset of TMP-related ADRs in humans.",M1
18670770,"Development of a yeast protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) system using dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with specific additives.A yeast protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) system based on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is difficult to be operated because it is not as sensitive to trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) as the system using a prokaryotic microorganism. Here, the PCA system using DHFR, specific inhibitors, and a substrate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was newly developed. As a model, the human oncoprotein Ras and the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 were individually and genetically fused to DHFR fragment, and each genetic construct was coexpressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter. An interaction between Ras and RBD could be evaluated on the basis of cell proliferation. To establish the experimental conditions for the yeast PCA system based on the DHFR reconstitution, we examined yeast host strains and the concentration of inhibitory additives to prevent endogenous DHFR activity, namely, TMP and sulfanilamide, and the substrate of DHFR, namely, folic acid. The transformant harboring wild-type Ras or its variants showed positive interaction signals, and the order of interactions for combination corresponded to the results of other in vitro assays. Moreover, combinatorial mutated Ras-binding domains were constructed, and the interaction of RBDs with Ras using this yeast PCA system was examined. As a result, various types of mutated clone for RBD were obtained. These demonstrations suggest that the yeast PCA system based on DHFR can be one of good, convenient, and inexpensive tools for investigating eukaryotic protein-protein interactions in vivo.",M1
18560629,"Hepatic disposition of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.Hepatic disposition of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the liver distributional volumes were investigated in the in situ perfused rat liver preparation. Perfusion experiments were conducted using Krebs-bicarbonate buffer delivered via the portal vein (15 ml/min) in a single-pass mode. Erythrocytes (intravascular marker) and Evans blue (extracellular marker) were used for the estimation of liver distributional volumes, and desiccation and freeze-drying methods were used for the estimation of liver water content. TMP and SMX were administered together as a bolus in the presence (1%) and absence of protein. Although SMX profiles displayed a characteristic sharp peak followed by a slower eluting tail in all cases, TMP profiles were dependent on protein; in the absence of protein, the early sharp peak was replaced by a flatter profile with a later peak. Fractional effluent recovery (F; 0.77 vs. 0.82) and hepatic clearance (CL(H); 3.44 vs. 2.70 ml/min) for TMP were not influenced by albumin; with SMX, F increased (0.32 vs. 0.60) and CL(H) decreased (10.2 vs. 6.0 ml/min) with an increase in the perfusate protein concentration. Hepatic extraction of TMP was low (&lt;0.30), whereas it was intermediate (&lt;0.70) for SMX. In addition, distributional volumes and total water content of the liver were successfully determined.",M1
18482201,"Absence of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients receiving short-term (3-month) prophylaxis.Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) is a fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia (PCP) in liver transplant recipients. Consequently, prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMZ) is typically administered for at least 1 year at most liver transplant programs. At our center we have utilized a short-term (3-month) prophylactic regimen with TMP/SMZ for the past decade and report our experience and speculate on the potential widespread application of this approach. METHODS: For patients transplanted at our center between January 1997 and January 2007, we recorded all documented PCP infections by review of our liver transplant database and hospital-based electronic medical records system, both of which record all infections and culture results. RESULTS: We recorded no cases of PCP in any of the liver transplant recipients at our center during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: We report the absence of PCP in a large cohort of liver transplant recipients receiving a short-term (3-month) prophylaxis with TMP/SMZ. These findings provide a rational basis to consider short-term (3-month) PCP prophylaxis or avoidance of prophylaxis altogether in selected low-risk patients.",M1
18303133,"Memantine-induced myoclonus and delirium exacerbated by trimethoprim.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of myoclonus and delirium seen in a patient taking a combination of memantine and trimethoprim. CASE SUMMARY: A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the medical center in October 2007 with rapid deterioration of Alzheimer's dementia and progressive myoclonus. In 2003, donepezil 5 mg/day had been initiated and her disease slowly progressed. In 2006, memantine 10 mg twice daily was added. Myoclonic activity and delirium were noted in 2007 when a urinary tract infection (UTI) was treated with double-strength trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX 160 mg/800 mg). After discontinuation of TMP/SMX, the patient's condition returned to baseline level. Several weeks later, trimethoprim 100 mg daily was added for UTI prophylaxis. Within weeks, spontaneous generalized myoclonic activity resumed to the extent that the patient was unable to walk. She became increasingly delirious. A week before admission, levodopa/carbidopa 250 mg/100 mg was added for presumptive restless legs syndrome and the patient became extremely delirious and combative, requiring hospitalization. Because of the striking similarity of dose-related toxicities reported with amantadine, a slightly different aminoadamantane, memantine was withheld. Trimethoprim was discontinued due to a likely interaction with memantine. Donepezil and famotidine were withheld due to questions of therapeutic necessity. After 3 days, the myoclonus had completely resolved and the patient was no longer agitated or combative during the remainder of her hospitalization. She was cooperative and ambulatory and was discharged. DISCUSSION: Memantine is cleared primarily through the kidneys and should be renally dosed. Drugs that interfere with elimination-that is, other drugs utilizing the organic cation transporter-2 in the tubule, such as trimethoprim, metformin, or imipramine-may lead to drug accumulation. Our patient, who had impaired renal function, developed severe myoclonus and delirium after trimethoprim was added to therapy with memantine. As there were no reports of myoclonus and delirium with this drug combination and because of the structural, pharmacologic, and pharmacokinetic similarities between the aminoadamantanes memantine and amantadine, we researched similar dual adverse effects reported with amantadine. Amantadine has led to the same adverse effects noted in our patient, not only in patients with renal impairment, but also in one patient when trimethoprim was added to a stable dose of amantadine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of a drug interaction between memantine and trimethoprim, which resulted in clinically significant myoclonus and delirium. Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction, since there have been reports of this adverse effect with the use of amantadine. Because memantine chemically and pharmacologically resembles amantadine, it is quite possible that their toxicities are similar.",M1
18193296,"Febrile urinary tract infection in children: ampicillin and trimethoprim insufficient as empirical mono-therapy.The aim of this study was to characterize the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in defined groups of children (total number 694) with urinary tract infection (UTI) regarding age, first UTI (FUTI) or recurrent UTI (RUTI), renal abnormalities or vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) in order to optimize empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. In patients aged between 1 month and 24 months with a first febrile UTI (FUTI; n = 205) the leading pathogen was Escherichia coli (E. coli) (83.4%). In comparison with patients with FUTI, those with RUTI (n = 24) had more Enterococcus and Enterobacter infections and higher resistance rates of E. coli against trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) or ampicillin (AMP). Boys with ultrasound-detected renal abnormalities (n = 71) showed 14.2% Pseudomonas and 59.1% E. coli infections versus girls (n = 48) (2.1% Pseudomonas and 93.7% E. coli). Of 390 patients who underwent voiding cysto-urethrography, 31.5% had VUR. Of them, 45.5% received antimicrobial prophylaxis with SXT (n = 30) or cefazolin (n = 26). There was no difference between girls (n = 242) and boys (n = 148) regarding the frequency of VUR and pathogens. There were more TMP- and SXT-resistant E. coli cultures from patients with VUR (37.8%) than from those without VUR (25.8%). Treatment with TMP, SXT and AMP alone appeared to be insufficient in many cases because of high resistance rates of E. coli and other uropathogens.",M1
18024520,"A naturally occurring gene amplification leading to sulfonamide and trimethoprim resistance in Streptococcus agalactiae.Gene amplifications have been detected as a transitory phenomenon in bacterial cultures. They are predicted to contribute to rapid adaptation by simultaneously increasing the expression of genes clustered on the chromosome. However, genome amplifications have rarely been described in natural isolates. Through DNA array analysis, we have identified two Streptococcus agalactiae strains carrying tandem genome amplifications: a fourfold amplification of 13.5 kb and a duplication of 92 kb. Both amplifications were located close to the terminus of replication and originated independently from any long repeated sequence. They probably arose in the human host and showed different stabilities, the 13.5-kb amplification being lost at a frequency of 0.003 per generation and the 92-kb tandem duplication at a frequency of 0.035 per generation. The 13.5-kb tandem amplification carried the five genes required for dihydrofolate biosynthesis and led to both trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and sulfonamide (SU) resistance. Resistance to SU probably resulted from the increased synthesis of dihydropteroate synthase, the target of this antibiotic, whereas the amplification of the whole pathway was responsible for TMP resistance. This revealed a new mechanism of resistance to TMP involving an increased dihydrofolate biosynthesis. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of naturally occurring antibiotic resistance resulting from genome amplification in bacteria. The low stability of DNA segment amplifications suggests that their role in antibiotic resistance might have been underestimated.",M1

Experimental designs were employed to optimize the electrospray conditions. MS/MS experiments using an IT as analyzer operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode were carried out to achieve the minimum number of points according to the 2002/657/EC European Decision for unambiguous identification. The proposed procedures have been compared in terms of the performance characteristics and trueness. The limits of detection and quantification were in all cases lower than the maximum residue limits legislated for these compounds and the recoveries were satisfactory, being possible the application for their monitoring in foodstuff of animal origin and in environmental samples, allowing the determination of sulfonamides and TMP residues in meat and in superficial water in the low microg/L range.",M1
17956962,"Multidrug-resistant Ewingella americana: a case report and review of the literature.OBJECTIVE: To describe and report a case of multidrug-resistant Ewingella americana associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old female presented to her physician with shortness of breath and an initial assessment of pneumonia. Her past medical history included COPD, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, recent Mycobacterium avium infection, and Crohn's disease. Blood and urine cultures revealed no growth; however, a sputum culture later revealed multidrug-resistant E. americana. The patient was ultimately treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX), with complete resolution of symptoms following a 10 day course. DISCUSSION: E. americana is a rare gram-negative bacillus that has infrequently been reported to cause infection. This organism has been reported in humans in the blood, sputum, conjunctiva, wounds, and peritoneal fluid. In several of these cases, as well as in our case, this organism appeared to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients. Although generally susceptible to most antibiotics, our patient's organism was resistant to all antibiotics tested, with the exception of TMP/SMX, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and cefotetan. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is only the second case of an E. americana respiratory infection, and the only one in which multidrug resistance has been reported.",M1
17914874,"Simple multiresidue method for monitoring of trimethoprim and sulfonamide residues in buffalo meat by high-performance liquid chromatography.A simple, specific, and rapid analytical method for the determination of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and three sulfonamide (SA) antimicrobial drug residues in buffalo meat is developed and validated. This method is based on a solid-phase extraction technique followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-photodiode array (PDA) detection. Target compounds were extracted from the meat by acetonitrile and water, cleaned up on a Bond Elute C 18 cartridge column, and separated on a RP-C 18 column during HPLC analysis. Acetonitrile along with water appears to be an excellent extractant as recovery of the analytes at maximum residues levels (MRLs) in spiked sample was in the range of 75-108%, with coefficient of variations (CVs) ranging between 1.34 and 22%. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.031 and 0.062 microg/g, respectively, for all of the compounds. Intra- and interday assay precisions of the method at 0.125 microg/g concentrations for any drug ranged between 3 and 4%. The linearities of the TMP, sulfadimidine (SDM), sulfadoxine (SDO), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were 0.9989, 0.9999, 0.9998, and 0.9997, respectively. For robustness, the analytical method was applied to 122 buffalo meat samples obtained from export meat processing plants.",M1
17875993,"In vitro efficacy of new antifolates against trimethoprim-resistant Bacillus anthracis.Bacillus anthracis is innately resistant to trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), a synthetic antifolate that selectively inhibits several bacterial dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) but not human DHFR. Previously, we were able to confirm that TMP resistance in B. anthracis (MIC &gt; 2,048 microg/ml) is due to the lack of selectivity of TMP for the B. anthracis DHFR (E. W. Barrow, P. C. Bourne, and W. W. Barrow, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48:4643-4649, 2004). In this investigation, 24 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives, representing a class of compounds with dihydrophthalazine side chains, were screened for their in vitro effects on B. anthracis Sterne and their selectivities for the B. anthracis DHFR. MICs were obtained by a colorimetric (Alamar blue) broth microdilution assay. Purified human recombinant DHFR (rDHFR) and B. anthracis rDHFR were used in a validated enzyme assay to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) and the selectivity ratios of the derivatives. The MICs ranged from 12.8 to 128 microg/ml for all but nine compounds, for which the MICs were &gt; or =128 microg/ml. The IC(50) values for B. anthracis rDHFR ranged from 46 to 600 nM, whereas the IC(50) values for human rDHFR were &gt;16,000 nM. This is the first report on the in vitro inhibitory actions of this class of antifolates against TMP-resistant B. anthracis isolates. The selective inhibition of B. anthracis rDHFR and the in vitro activity against B. anthracis demonstrate that members of this class of compounds have the potential to be developed into clinically important therapeutic choices for the treatment of infections caused by TMP-resistant bacteria, such as B. anthracis.",M1
17875309,"Pressurized capillary electrochromatographic assay of trimethoprim impurities using 1 microm particle-based columns.One micrometre silica particles, derivatized with C18, were electrokinetically packed into a 75-microm-i.d. capillary. The resulting column was evaluated for the separation of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and its impurities using pressurized capillary electrochromatography (pCEC), starting from a capillary liquid chromatographic (CLC) separation. These samples require gradient elution when separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), but with the new columns isocratic elution suffices for their separation by CLC or pCEC. Only 70,000 theoretical plates/m for impurity C were achieved using CLC mode at relative low pressure (78 bar) although very small particles were utilized. When a voltage above 2 kV (50 V/cm) was applied, unknown peaks appeared, which was assumed due to an electrophoretic effect with the unknown peaks resolving as a result of the applied voltage. In order to minimize these unfavorable contributions, only a low voltage was applied, still leading to higher separation performances and shorter separation times than in CLC. The optimal analyzing conditions in pCEC included a pressure of 78 bar, an applied voltage of 1 kV, and a mobile phase consisting of 80 mM sodium perchlorate (pH 3.1)/methanol (60/40, v/v). These conditions were used to separate and quantify four major impurities in TMP within 22 min. The obtained calibration curves were linear (r&gt;0.9980) in concentration ranges between 0.005 and 0.1 mg/mL for impurities A and C; 0.02 and 0.10 mg/mL for impurity F; and 0.01 and 0.10 mg/mL for impurity H. The detection limits (S/N=3) for impurities A, C, F, and H were 0.52, 0.84, 3.18, and 2.41 microg/mL, respectively. The calibration curves were successfully applied to analyze spiked bulk samples, with mean recoveries ranging from 92% to 110%. The developed method can therefore be considered simple, rapid, and repeatable.",M1

The proteins were partially precipitated by adding 0.5 mL of acetonitrile into 1.0 mL of blended egg followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was injected (250 microL) directly into the multidimensional system. At the first dimension, a restricted access medium (RAM) bovine serum albumin (BSA) octadecyl column (100 mm x 46 mm I.D., Luna silica, 10 microm particle size and 100 A pore size), was used for extraction and concentration of the analytes and at second dimension, an octadecyl column (150 mm x 46 mm I.D., Luna silica, 10 microm particle size and 100 A pore size), for analysis. The developed method showed good selectivity, accuracy and precision for quantification of these different compounds in eggs, and the limits of quantification were 80 ng/mL, for both compounds.

These phases include an unsolvated form of BMP, a hemihydrate (BMP 0.5H(2)O), a 1:1 solvate containing isopropanol (BMP C(3)H(7)OH(iso)), and a hemichloroformate (BMP 0.5CHCl(3)). Unsolvated BMP was isolated both by recrystallization from a range of common solvents as well as by thermal decomposition of the above solvates and no evidence for polymorphism was found. PXRD data indicated that the three solvates crystallize in different arrangements. Data from thermal analysis (thermogravimetry (TGA), hot stage microscopy (HSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) of the solvates containing water and iso-propanol were interpreted on the basis of their single-crystal X-ray structures which revealed that the modes of solvent inclusion in BMP 0.5H(2)O and BMP C(3)H(7)OH(iso) may be described as 'isolated site' and 'lattice channel' type inclusions, respectively.",M1

17173950,"Aqueous chlorination of the antibacterial agent trimethoprim: reaction kinetics and pathways.Trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), one of the antibacterials most frequently detected in municipal wastewaters and surface waters, reacts readily with free available chlorine (i.e., HOCl) at pH values between 3 and 9 (e.g., the pH-dependent apparent second-order rate constant, k''(app)=5.6 x 10(1)M(-1)s(-1), at pH 7). Solution pH significantly affects the rate of TMP reaction with HOCl. The reaction kinetics in reagent water systems can be well described by a second-order kinetic model incorporating speciation of both reactants and accounting for acid-mediated halogenation of TMP's 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety. Studies with the substructure model compounds 2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene show that TMP reacts with HOCl primarily via its 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl moiety at acidic pH, and with its 2,4-diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at circumneutral and alkaline pH. LC/MS product analyses indicate that the TMP structure is not substantially degraded upon reactions with HOCl. Instead, a wide variety of (multi)chlorinated and hydroxylated products are formed. Experiments with real drinking water and wastewater matrixes confirmed that substantial TMP transformation can be expected for conditions typical of wastewater and drinking water chlorination.",M1
16997591,"Oropharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae among HIV-infected adults in Uganda: assessing prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate characteristics of Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with oropharyngeal colonization in the Ugandan adult HIV population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study at the outpatient HIV clinic at the Joint Clinical Research Centre in Kampala, Uganda between July 2004 and February 2005. Six hundred HIV-infected individuals were interviewed and had oropharyngeal specimens collected. Pneumococci were isolated from these specimens and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns determined using standard microdilution methods. Serotypes of the pneumococcal isolates were evaluated by capsular swelling reaction with commercial antisera. RESULTS: The prevalence of oropharyngeal colonization with pneumococci was 18% (108/600). Thirty-two different pneumococcal serotypes were identified, and the most common were serotypes 3 (14.7%), 19F (6.4%), 23F (6.4%), and 16 (5.5%). Seventy-two percent of the isolates were penicillin (PCN) intermediate (MICs 0.12-1 microg/mL), the remainder all being PCN susceptible, and &gt;99% were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMX) resistant. Novel PCN intermediate serotypes included 7, 11, 16, 20, 22, 24, and 34. Only one isolate was resistant to macrolides, and resistance to other antibiotics was rare.

16750361,"Analysis of complexes of inhibitors with Cryptosporidium hominis DHFR leads to a new trimethoprim derivative.Cryptosporidiosis, an opportunistic infection affecting immunocompromised patients, the elderly, and children, is still an untreatable disease since the causative agent, Cryptosporidium hominis, is essentially resistant to all clinically used antimicrobial agents. In order to accelerate the design of new potent and selective inhibitors targeting dihydrofolate reductase of C. hominis (ChDHFR), we determined the structural basis for the potency of existing DHFR inhibitors using superpositions of the structure of ChDHFR with other species and analysis of active site complexes of ChDHFR bound to ligands exhibiting a wide range of IC(50) values. This information was used to develop an accurate docking model capable of identifying potent inhibitors in silico.

16405904,"Effects of co-operative ligand binding on protein amide NH hydrogen exchange.Amide protection factors have been determined from NMR measurements of hydrogen/deuterium amide NH exchange rates measured on assigned signals from Lactobacillus casei apo-DHFR and its binary and ternary complexes with trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), folinic acid and coenzymes (NADPH/NADP(+)). The substantial sizes of the residue-specific DeltaH and TDeltaS values for the opening/closing events in NH exchange for most of the measurable residues in apo-DHFR indicate that sub-global or global rather than local exchange mechanisms are usually involved. The amide groups of residues in helices and sheets are those most protected in apo-DHFR and its complexes, and the protection factors are generally related to the tightness of ligand binding. The effects of ligand binding that lead to changes in amide protection are not localised to specific binding sites but are spread throughout the structure via a network of intramolecular interactions. Although the increase in protein stability in the DHFR.TMP.NADPH complex involves increased ordering in the protein structure (requiring TDeltaS energy) this is recovered, to a large extent, by the stronger binding (enthalpic DeltaH) interactions made possible by the reduced motion in the protein. The ligand-induced protection effects in the ternary complexes DHFR.TMP.NADPH (large positive binding co-operativity) and DHFR.folinic acid.NADPH (large negative binding co-operativity) mirror the co-operative effects seen in the ligand binding. For the DHFR.TMP.NADPH complex, the ligand-induced protection factors result in DeltaDeltaG(o) values for many residues being larger than the DeltaDeltaG(o) values in the corresponding binary complexes. In contrast, for DHFR.folinic acid.NADPH, the DeltaDeltaG(o) values are generally smaller than many of those in the corresponding binary complexes. The results indicate that changes in protein conformational flexibility on formation of the ligand complex play an important role in determining the co-operativity in the ligand binding.",M1
16310307,"Equilibrium studies for trimethoprim adsorption on montmorillonite KSF.In this study, the adsorption of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) on montmorillonite KSF was studied under different conditions (pH, ionic strength, temperature). The results indicate that a pH value of 5.04 is optimum value for the adsorption of TMP on KSF. The adsorption kinetics was interpreted using pseudo-first-order kinetic model, pseudo-second-order kinetic model and intraparticle diffusion model. The pseudo-second-order model provides the best correlation with the experimental data of KSF adsorption. The adsorption data could be fitted with Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich equation to find the characteristic parameters of each model. It was found that linear form of Langmuir isotherm seems to produce a better model than linear form of Freundlich equation. From the Langmuir and Freundlich equation, the adsorption capacity values raised as the solution temperature decreased. From DR isotherm, it was also determined that the type of adsorption can be considered as ion-exchange mechanism. Determination of the thermodynamic parameters DeltaH(0), DeltaS(0) and DeltaG(0) showed that adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. It was also added that adsorption of TMP by KSF may involve physical adsorption.",M1
16286787,"Effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on Na and K+ transport properties in the rabbit cortical collecting duct perfused in vitro.BACKGROUND: In this study, the membrane mechanisms of hyperkalemia caused by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMX) combination antibiotics were assessed in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). METHODS: We used the microelectrode technique and flux measurements, and examined the effects of TMP and SMX on electrical properties of the apical and basolateral membranes in the rabbit CCD perfused in vitro. RESULTS: TMP in the lumen caused increases in apical membrane voltage, fractional apical membrane resistance (fRA), and transepithelial resistance (RT), all effects which were completely inhibited by luminal amiloride, but not by luminal Ba2+. The luminal TMP inhibited both net Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in the CCD. TMP in the bath slightly but significantly depolarized transepithelial voltage and basolateral membrane voltage without influencing fRA or RT. SMX in the lumen or bath had no effect on barrier voltages or resistances. CONCLUSION: TMP mainly acts on the apical membrane of the CCD, inhibits the amiloride-sensitive macroscopic Na+ conductance in this membrane, and thereby decreases the net driving force for K+ exit across the membrane, resulting in an inhibition of K+ secretion. SMX in the lumen or bath had no effect on the CCD.",M1

However, at present, there exists great concern over the widespread use of antibiotics in aquaculture, which may result in residue of antibiotics in water and mud, and subsequently, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria in the environment. There is limited understanding about the effect of antibiotic residues on bacteria resistance in shrimp farming environment. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate bacterial resistance to Norfloxacin (NFXC), Oxolinic Acid (OXLA), Trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which were found in four shrimp farming locations in mangrove areas in Vietnam. Findings indicate that there is a relatively high incidence of bacteria resistance to these antibiotics observed in most of the studied sites, particularly to antibiotics with concentration of 0.1 microg/ml. Yet the relation between concentration of antibiotic residues and incidence of antibiotic resistance is not clearly defined. Among individual antibiotics, the incidence of resistance to TMP and SMX was higher than the others. Identification of bacteria isolated from mud samples by DNA analyzer shows that Bacillus and Vibrio are predominant among bacteria resistant to the antibiotics. The result of the study also indicates that these antibiotics in media degraded more rapidly due to the presence of resistant bacteria.",M1
16169294,"High-performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in bovine milk using an on-line clean-up column.A bidimensional HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) in bovine milk has been developed and validated. After centrifugation, aliquots (150 microl) of milk samples were directly injected to a column-switching HPLC system. At the first step a RAM octyl-BSA column was employed to automatically remove proteins that otherwise would interfere with milk analysis. The mobile phase 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0:acetonitrile (95:5, v/v) was used in the first 5 min for the elution of milk proteins and then 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0:acetonitrile (83:17, v/v) for transfer SMX and TMP to the analytical column. The separation of SMX and TMP from one another and from other remaining milk components was performed on an octyl column using the mobile phase 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 5.0:acetonitrile (82:18, v/v), which were detected by UV at 265 nm. The calibration graphs were linear in the concentration ranges of 25-800 ng/ml and 50-400 ng/ml for SMX and TMP, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 15% for both drugs. The validated method was applied to the analysis of milk samples of twelve (two groups of six) cows after administration (intramuscular or subcutaneous) of a single recommended therapeutic dose of the SMX-TMP combination.",M1

UV-spectrophotometry and phase-solubility techniques were employed to investigate the complexation behaviour in liquid medium, and to demonstrate that the aqueous solubility of TMP increased 2.2-fold due to complexation with beta-CD. Solid samples prepared by co-evaporation (in 2 wt% acetic acid solution) have also been studied, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), to assess the formation of the inclusion complex. The water content of the complex and beta-CD was determined using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA).

The UV spectra enhancement of TMP as result of complex with beta-CD was investigated. Complexation with beta-CD increase the TMP aqueous solubility and the phase solubility diagram was A(L) type. Thermodynamic parameters of the complex process, K, DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS, were determined from the phase solubility diagram at 298 and 318 K, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the complex process was an enthalpy-driven process. Mechanism of the complex of beta-CD with TMP was further discussed using the molecular model program.

15925233,"Adsorptive stripping voltammetry of trimethoprim: mechanistic studies and application to the fast determination in pharmaceutical suspensions.The adsorptive stripping voltammetric behaviour of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) was studied at pH 3.8 and 7.0 by linear-sweep (LS) and cyclic voltammetry at the hanging mercury drop electrode. The charges and surface concentrations of the protonated TMP species were determined at both pH values. Taking advantage of the adsorption features of TMP fast voltammetric techniques (LS and square-wave (SW) voltammetry) were applied to the determination of TMP at the 10(-7)mol dm(-3) concentration level (pH 3.8). For these concentrations the relative standard deviations were &lt;2% (N=8) and the detection limit was 10nM (3 ng/mL) for the SW-AdCSV (3s; accumulation time 10s, frequency 100 Hz). The use of SW-adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry originated a very fast and sensitive method for the direct analysis of TMP in pharmaceutical suspensions without any matrix effects or interference from sulfamethoxazole. No sample pre-treatments or solvent extraction procedures were needed. The quantitative results were in agreement with the data supplied by the manufacturer.",M1
15918650,"An analysis of a community-acquired pathogen in a Kentucky community: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.CONTEXT: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections have been reported in patients with recognized predisposing risk factors in several cities in the United States and across the world. Reviewing risk factors in adult patients with CA-MRSA in Kentucky has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors of 15 patients with CA-MRSA in Louisville KY, to compare the sensitivities of each pathogen and to recommend management. SETTING: An infectious diseases private practice in Louisville, KY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case series of patients with CA-MRSA. The disease course for each patient was reviewed for risk factors, such as participation in physical contact sports and prison exposure. The antimicrobial sensitivities of each pathogen were also reviewed. Recommendations were produced from the information obtained. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were reviewed. Five patients had a family member or significant-other with a current CA-MRSA infection. Three had traditional risk factors (healthcare workers). All of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and resistant to oxacillin. All of the isolates tested for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX), tetracycline, and rifampin were sensitive. A majority (83%) of those tested for clindamycin and only 50% of those tested for levofloxacin were sensitive. All isolates tested for cefazolin were resistant. CONCLUSIONS: An emerging risk factor for acquiring an MRSA skin and soft tissue infection is having a significant-other with a current diagnosis of CA-MRSA. After incision and drainage, a review of the antimicrobial sensitivities indicates that oral treatment may be adequate for a selection of cases.",M1
15835260,"Sustained availability of trimethoprim in drinking water to achieve higher plasma sulphonamide-trimethoprim antibacterial activity in broilers.(1) In order to make trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) available to broilers throughout the day, a sustained release formulation (SRF) of the drug in the form of granules was added to the water tank that supplies drinking water. (2) Broilers were initially dosed with sulphachloropiridazine-TMP (SCP-TMP 5:1) and then further medicated throughout the day, achieving in the end a dose of 30 mg/kg each of SCP and TMP (group A). Group B received a preparation with the same dose of SCP and TMP (1:1) as group A, but administered as a single dose without the SRF of TMP. Group C received the customary SCP-TMP 5:1 preparation (30 and 6 mg/kg, respectively). Water tanks were completely consumed in 3 to 4 h. (3) Broilers were bled at different times and concentration of antibacterial activity in serum determined by correlating the composite antibacterial activity of SCP and TMP with actual concentrations of these drugs by means of a microbiological agar diffusion assay. (4) Time vs serum concentrations of activity were higher in group B; the increments in the maximum serum concentration for group B over groups A and C being 39 and 67%, respectively. (5) However, the sustained concentration of activity over time, measured as the area under the cu)rve, was highest in group A. Group B had higher values for area under the curve than group C. (6) An additional dose of TMP to achieve 30 mg/kg of both SCP and TMP improves the serum concentration of this combination over the customary 5:1 proportion. The best values for sustaining antibacterial activity were obtained using a 1:1 ratio as in group A. The use of a SRF as in group A may translate into better clinical results.",M1
15774257,"Prospective, randomized, multicentric, open, comparative study on the efficacy of a prophylactic single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin versus 1920 mg trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole versus a control group in patients undergoing TUR of the prostate.OBJECTIVES: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is one of the most frequent urological procedures. The efficacy of a prophylactic single dose of levofloxacin vs. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMZ) vs. a control group, receiving no antibiotic prophylaxis, in patients undergoing TUR-P was investigated in a multicentre study. The aims were to assess the rate of bacteriuria (cfu&gt; or =10(4)/ml) 5 to 7 days, and 3 to 5 weeks after TUR-P, as well as postoperative complications. METHODS: The study was prospective, randomized, multicentric, open and comparative. Patients without bacteriuria (cfu&lt;10(4)/ml) scheduled for TUR-P and not having received antibiotics prior within four days were enclosed. Patients received an oral single dose prophylaxis with either 500 mg levofloxacin, or 320/1600 mg TMP/SMZ, or no prophylaxis according to a 2:2:1 randomization. Clinical examination of the patients and urine culture were performed prior to, 5 to 7 days and 3 to 5 weeks after TUR-P. RESULTS: 14 urological centres throughout Germany recruited 400 patients. 376 patients were evaluable until day 5 to 7, 339 until week 3 to 5. Overall bacteriuria rate at day 5 to 7 was 22% (levofloxacin 21%; TMP/SMZ 20%; control group 30%). Bacteriuria rate at week 3 to 5 was 28% (levofloxacin 26%; TMP/SMZ 26%; control group 36%). Complication rate at week 3 to 5 was 10% (levofloxacin 8%; TMP/SMZ 10%; control group 16%). The rates of postoperative bacteriuria ranged widely between centers (0%-75%). Statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) risk factors for bacteriuria (range) were qualification of surgeon (19%-37%), presence of a suprapubic catheter (22%-34%), disconnection of the closed drainage system (25%-52%), operating time (12%-31%) and operative centre (0%-75%). Total antibiotic consumption (for prophylaxis and treatment) in the control group was higher and more expensive than in groups with antibiotic prophylaxis (6.9 vs. 5.0 doses/patient; 24.9 vs. 19.7 /patient) (p&lt;0.0001). Postoperative complications in patients with bacteriuria (cfu&gt; or =10(4)/ml) were more frequent than in non bacteriuric (cfu&lt;10(4)/ml) patients (17% vs. 8%) (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It is debatable whether postoperative bacteriuria is the key parameter to define efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing TUR-P. The rate of bacteriuria, however, correlated well with the overall rate of postoperative complications. Therefore, it seems reasonable to lower the rate of bacteriuria by prophylaxis. Since patients without antibiotic prophylaxis received at the end even more antibiotic doses than patients with prophylaxis, the overall selection pressure by antibiotic usage can obviously not be lowered by resigning prophylaxis. Therefore we conclude that at least patients at risk should receive antibiotic prophylaxis prior to TUR-P.",M1
15720514,"Clinical efficacy of prophylactic administration of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine in a Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus infection model in ponies.Tissue chambers, implanted subcutaneously in the neck in six ponies, were inoculated with Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus in order to determine the clinical efficacy of prophylactic administration of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine (<e>TMP</e>/SDZ) against this infection. The TMP/SDZ treatment consisted of one intravenous (i.v.) injection of 5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SDZ and the same dose of TMP/SDZ per os (p.o.), both given 3 h before inoculation. The oral dose was then repeated every 12 h for 5 days. TMP/SDZ concentrations in tissue chamber fluid (TCF) were above 10 times MIC at the moment of inoculation, and they were maintained at this level or higher throughout the duration of treatment. Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine treatment resulted in a marked reduction of viable bacteria in the tissue chamber but did not eliminate the infection, resulting in abscessation from day 19 onwards in all six ponies. This shows that, even when TCF is not yet purulent, TMP/SDZ is unable to eliminate the streptococci. Therefore, TMP/SDZ should not be the antimicrobial treatment of choice in infections in secluded sites in horses.",M1

Stacking is due to decreases in the velocity of analytes when migrating from the low-pH sample zone (sample was dissolved in 50 mM HCl) to a relatively high-pH buffer (30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.5) filled in the capillary. This results in 2.9-4.7-fold improvement in concentration sensitivity relative to conventional capillary electrophoresis methods. The separation could be achieved within 2 min and sample throughput rate can reach up to 38 h(-1).",M1
15561838,"Functional cloning of Bacillus anthracis dihydrofolate reductase and confirmation of natural resistance to trimethoprim.Bacillus anthracis is reported to be naturally resistant to trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), a drug that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the folate pathway. A microdilution broth assay established that the MIC of TMP for B. anthracis Sterne is &gt;2,048 but &lt; or =4,096 microg/ml. A putative DHFR sequence was amplified from B. anthracis Sterne genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into the Invitrogen pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector, followed by transformation into Escherichia coli TOP10F' chemically competent cells. Plasmid DNA from a clone showing the correct construct with a thrombin cleavage site attached downstream from the terminus of the cloned PCR product was transformed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells for expression of the six-histidine-tagged fusion protein and purification on a His-Bind resin column. Functionality of the purified Sterne recombinant DHFR (Sterne rDHFR) was confirmed in an established enzyme assay. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of TMP and methotrexate for the Sterne rDHFR were found to be 77,233 and 12.2 nM, respectively. TMP resistance was observed with E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells transformed with the Sterne DHFR gene. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Sterne DHFR gene revealed 100% homology with various virulent strains of B. anthracis. These results confirm the natural resistance of B. anthracis to TMP and clarify that the resistance is correlated to a lack of selectivity for the chromosomally encoded gene product. These findings will assist in the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents for treatment of anthrax.",M1
15504256,"Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystis and sulfa resistance.Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) remains a major cause of illness and death in HIV-infected persons. Sulfa drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMX) and dapsone are mainstays of PCP treatment and prophylaxis. While prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of PCP, its use has raised concerns about development of resistant organisms. The inability to culture human Pneumocystis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, in a standardized culture system prevents routine susceptibility testing and detection of drug resistance. In other microorganisms, sulfa drug resistance has resulted from specific point mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene. Similar mutations have been observed in P. jirovecii. Studies have consistently demonstrated a significant association between the use of sulfa drugs for PCP prophylaxis and DHPS gene mutations. Whether these mutations confer resistance to TMP-SMX or dapsone plus trimethoprim for PCP treatment remains unclear. We review studies of DHPS mutations in P. jirovecii and summarize the evidence for resistance to sulfamethoxazole and dapsone.",M1
15319548,"Comparative antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens.Bacterial respiratory tract infections (RTIs), whether primary or subsequent to viral infection, are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment of these infections is most often empirical. Therefore, an antimicrobial's antibacterial spectrum must include the most likely pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as atypicals such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae. In addition, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance among these key pathogens is imperative for physicians to choose the most appropriate therapeutic agent. The latest data from global surveillance studies indicates that high-level resistance to penicillin (MIC &gt; or =2 mg/l) among isolates of S. pneumoniae varies widely by geographic location. Rates exceed 20% in the USA, Mexico, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, and the Slovak Republic. In South Africa, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea rates exceed 50%. Penicillin non-susceptibility--including isolates exhibiting high-level resistance and intermediate susceptibility (MIC 0.12-1 mg/l)--is frequently found in association with macrolide resistance, which is found at a prevalence of 70-80% in some Asian countries. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMX) and tetracycline resistance, either individually or combined with macrolide resistance as multiple resistance, is also associated with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. Another concern about antimicrobial resistance in respiratory tract pathogens is beta-lactamase production among isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. However, respiratory fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin has been available for the longest time, currently remain active against the great majority of common bacterial respiratory pathogens, including atypicals.",M1
15262532,"Chemometric and derivative methods as flexible spectrophotometric approaches for dissolution and assaying tests in multicomponent tablets.Two derivative spectrophotometric (ratio derivative spectra and algorithm bivariate calibration) and a chemometric methods (partial least squares, PLS) are proposed for the simultaneous determination of binary mixtures in tablet analysis and dissolutions tests, without prior separation. These approaches are successfully applied to quantify trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) combined with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or sulfamethazine (SMZ) or sulfafurazole (SFZ) using the information in the absorption spectra of appropriate solutions. Beer's law was obeyed in the concentration range of 0.98-17.5 microg/ml for TMP, 0.95-17.2 microg/ml for SMX, 1.16-17.5 microg/ml for SMZ and 0.97-17.4 microg/ml for SFZ. The first derivative (1D) bivariate algorithm method involves the use of four calibration curves: two for each compound at two different wavelengths, selected by Kaiser's method. Similarly, the first derivative ratio spectrophotometry employs the linear relationship between the ratio spectra of the analytes and the concentration range. The results were compared with those obtained by PLS multivariate calibration. The calibration models from PLS were pre-treated by orthogonal signal correction and evaluated by cross-validation using the 'SIMCA-P 9' software. Synthetic mixtures of TMP and sulfonamides were used in five different sets for the validity of the calibrations. Mean recoveries for derivative ratio, derivative bivariate and PLS methods were found to be between 99.7% and 102.0% for TMP, 99.4% and 100.2% for SMX, 99.3% and 101.0% for SMZ and 98.1% and 102.3% for SFZ. The calibrations of the three methods were successfully applied to the assaying and dissolution of placebo and commercial tablets without any prior separation. More than 85% of TMP, SMX and SMZ were dissolved within 15 min. For SFZ, only 85% of the compound was dissolved after 60 min. In this study, the three spectrophotometric methods can be satisfactorily used for the quantitative analysis and for dissolution tests of multicomponent dosage forms.",M1
15120732,"Resistance of uropathogens in symptomatic urinary tract infections in León, Nicaragua.Management of urinary tract infections (UTI) in Central America and especially Nicaragua, is complicated by the lack of knowledge about the antibiotic resistance of uropathogens. We conducted a prevalence study to gain more insight into the aetiology, bacterial resistance and risk factors for symptomatic UTI in the region of León, Nicaragua. In 2002, all consecutive patients with UTI symptoms and pyuria &gt;/=10 WBC/hpf were admitted to the study. Positive cultures from midstream urine specimens were defined as &gt;/=10(5) cfu/ml of a single uropathogen. Susceptibility tests were performed with disc diffusion tests using the Kirby-Bauer method and broth microdilution using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria both in León and a reference laboratory in Utrecht. A positive culture was present in 62 of 208 study subjects (30%). Escherichia coli (56%), Klebsiella spp. (18%) and Enterobacter spp. (11%) were the most frequent pathogens isolated. Presence of cystocele, incontinence and increasing age were risk factors for bacterial UTI. E. coli was least resistant to ceftriaxone, amikacin and nitrofurantoin (&gt;90% susceptible). We observed high resistance rates in E. coli to amoxicillin (82%, MIC(90) 128 mg/l), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>-SMX) (64%, MIC(90) 32 mg/l), cephalothin (58%, MIC(90), 32 mg/l), ciprofloxacin (30%; MIC(90), 32 mg/l), amoxicillin/clavulanate (21%, MIC(90) 8 mg/l) and gentamicin (12%, MIC(90) 2 mg/l). Our results suggests that community acquired uropathogens in Nicaragua are highly resistant to many antimicrobial agents. The use of amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and cephalothin against uropathogens needs to be reconsidered. High quinolone resistance rates among E. coli in Nicaragua gives cause for great concern.",M1
15026078,"Preliminary in vitro studies on two potent, water-soluble trimethoprim analogues with exceptional species selectivity against dihydrofolate reductase from Pneumocystis carinii and Mycobacterium avium.2,4-Diamino-5-[3',4'-dimethoxy-5'-(5-carboxy-1-pentynyl)]benzylpyrimidine (6) and 2,4-diamino-5-[3',4'-dimethoxy-5'-(4-carboxyphenylethynyl)benzylpyrimidine (7) were synthesized from 2,4-diamino-5-(5'-iodo-3',4'-dimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine (9) via a Sonogashira reaction with appropriate acetylenic esters followed by saponification, and were tested as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), Mycobacterium avium (Ma), and rat in comparison with the widely used antibacterial agent 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine (trimethoprim, <e>TMP</e>). The selectivity index (SI) for each compound was calculated by dividing its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against rat DHFR by its IC(50) against Pc, Tg, or Ma DHFR. The IC(50) of 6 against Pc DHFR was 1.0 nM, with an SI of 5000. Compound 7 had an IC(50) of 8.2 nM against Ma DHFR, with an SI of 11000. By comparison, the IC(50) of TMP was 12000 nM against Pc, 300 nM against Ma, and 180000 against rat DHFR. The potency and selectivity values of 6 and 7 were not as high against Tg as they were against Pc or Ma DHFR, but nonetheless exceeded those of TMP. Because of the outstanding selectivity of 6 against Pc and of 7 against Ma DHFR, these novel analogues may be viewed as promising leads for further structure-activity optimization.",M1
14711307,"Target guided synthesis of 5-benzyl-2,4-diamonopyrimidines: their antimalarial activities and binding affinities to wild type and mutant dihydrofolate reductases from Plasmodium falciparum.The resistance to pyrimethamine (PYR) of Plasmodium falciparum arising from mutation at position 108 of dihydrofolate reductase (pfDHFR) from serine to asparagine (S108N) is due to steric interaction between the bulky side chain of N108 and Cl atom of the 5-p-Cl aryl group of PYR, which consequently resulted in the reduction in binding affinity between the enzyme and inhibitor. Molecular modeling suggested that the flexible antifolate, such as trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) derivatives, could avoid this steric constraint and should be considered as new, potentially effective compounds. The hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of inhibitor and the active site of the enzyme around position 108 was enhanced by the introduction of a longer and more hydrophobic side chain on TMP's 5-benzyl moiety. The prepared compounds, especially those bearing aromatic substituents, exhibited better binding affinities to both wild type and mutant enzymes than the parent compound. Binding affinities of these compounds correlated well with their antimalarial activities against both wild type and resistant parasites. Molecular modeling of the binding of such compounds with pfDHFR also supported the experimental data and clearly showed that aromatic substituents play an important role in enhancing binding affinity. In addition, some compounds with 6-alkyl substituents showed relatively less decrease in binding constants with the mutant enzymes and relatively good antimalarial activities against the parasites bearing the mutant enzymes.",M1
14649737,"Efficacy of amikacin combinations for nocardiosis.We isolated five bacterial strains from patients diagnosed as having nocardiosis. Bacterial species were identified based on the similarities in the nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNAs. Three of the five strains were identified as Nocardia asteroids, but unexpectedly other two were Streptomyces hygroscopicus and Rothia dentocariosa. The latter two species are not members of the family Nocardiaceae. We investigated the susceptibilities of these five strains to the following nine antimicrobial agents: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX), minocycline (MINO), erythromycin (EM), amikacin (AMK), cefotaxime (CTX), faropenem (FRPM), imipenem (IPM), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and sparfloxacin (SPFX).

We have demonstrated for the first time that one of the effects of the TMP action in E. coli cells is protein aggregation and induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps). TMP caused induction of DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, ClpB, and IbpA/B Hsps. Among these Hsps, IbpA/B were most efficiently induced by TMP and coaggregated with the insoluble proteins. Upon folate stress, deletion of the delta ibpA/B operon resulted in increased protein aggregation but did not influence cell viability.",M1
14527774,"Fluoroquinolones and resistance in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.Acute uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention. Most of these infections are caused by Escherichia coli which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX). In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP/SMX resistance, a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin should be considered for empirical treatment. Use of nitrofurantoin does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials and its more widespread use is justified from a public health perspective as a fluoroquinolone-sparing agent. beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empirical treatment of cystitis. For acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, fluoroquinolones are superior to TMP/SMX for empirical therapy due to the relatively high prevalence of TMP/SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP/SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7-10 day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients.",M1

The penicillin treatment consisted of one i.v. injection of 20 000 IU/kg sodium penicillin G and intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 20 000 IU/kg procaine penicillin G, both given 20 h after infection. The i.m. dose was then repeated every 24 h for 21 days. Eight ponies, each with two tissue chambers, were used in a cross over design; in the first experiment the left tissue chamber (TC) was infected and in the second experiment the right. TMP/SDZ treatment resulted in a limited reduction of viable bacteria in the TC but did not eliminate the infection, resulting in abscessation in 10-42 days in all eight ponies. However, penicillin treatment eliminated the streptococci in seven of eight ponies, and only one pony suffered abscessation on day 10. This constitutes a significantly better efficacy of the penicillin treatment in this model. The most probable cause of the failure of TMP/SDZ to eliminate the streptococci is inhibition of the action of TMP/SDZ in the purulent TCF. Therefore, TMP/SDZ should not be used to treat purulent infections in secluded sites in horses.",M1
12778749,"[Study on separation of sulfonamides by capillary high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochromatography]AIM: To establish separation methods of five sulfonamides by using capillary high performance liquid chromatography(mu-HPLC) and electrochromatography. The effect of mobile phase varies such as methanol content, pH, buffer solution concentration and voltage on their chromatographic behavior and electroosmesis flow was investigated. Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) was compared with mu-HPLC at the same condition. METHODS: Stationary phase was ODS, mobile phase was methanol and 2 mmol.L-1 H3PO4 buffer solution (pH 3.0-7.0), voltage was 0- -15 kV, flow rate was 10 microL.min-1, pressure was approximately 70 MPa and UV detection wavelength was 254 nm. RESULTS: Separations on base line have been respectively accomplished for five sulfonamides by mu-HPLC with mobile phase of methanol-2 mmol.L-1 H3PO4 buffer solution (30:70) at pH 5.0 in 67 min, and CEC with the same mobile phase at -5 kV voltage in 25 min. CONCLUSION: Electroosmesis flow of CEC decreased with the increase in methanol content, buffer solution concentration, increased with the increase in voltage and increase slightly with the increase in pH of mobile phase. Retention values (k) of solutes to be examined decreased with increasing methanol content of mobile phase in mu-HPLC and CEC. Retention values (k) of solutes increased slightly with increasing buffer solution concentration, decreased with increasing voltage in CEC. Trimethoprim(<e>TMP</e>) decreased obviously with increasing voltage in CEC. The effect of pH of mobile phase on retention values (k) was more complex. Five sulfonamides were separated at the same mobile phase condition by mu-HPLC and CEC. And separation speed of CEC was much faster than that of mu-HPLC. CEC was very fit for rapid separation of sulfonamides.",M1
12773035,"Novel dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors. Structure-based versus diversity-based library design and high-throughput synthesis and screening.Novel 2,4-diaminopyrimidines bearing N,N-disubstituted aminomethyl residues at the 5-position were designed as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors. These compounds were obtained by treatment of 1-[(2,4-diamino-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl]pyridinium bromide with secondary amines in a polar solvent and in the presence of triethylamine at room temperature. The procedure was found to be very efficient and suitable for application in high-throughput synthesis. In addition, we found that high-throughput screening for enzymatic and in vitro antibacterial activity could be performed on crude reaction mixtures, thus avoiding any purification step. Over 1200 proprietary secondary amines were selected for high-throughput synthesis, based on structural and diversity-related criteria, and the resulting products were submitted to high-throughput screening. A greater number of hits, and significantly more active compounds, were obtained through structure-based library design than through diversity-based library design. Different classes of inhibitors of DHFR were identified in this way, including compounds derived from di-, tri-, and tetracyclic amines. In general, these products showed high activity against the enzymes derived from both <e>TMP</e>-sensitive and TMP-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some compounds possessed appreciable selectivity for the bacterial over the human enzyme, whereas other compounds were not at all selective. In most cases, active enzyme inhibitors also displayed antibacterial activity.",M1
12644193,"A flow injection sensor for simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim by using Sephadex SP C-25 for continuous on-line separation and solid phase UV transduction.A flow-through sensor based on integration of spectrophotometric detection and the different kinetics of retention/elution of analytes on a solid support is proposed for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>). The solid support (Sephadex SP C-25) fills both, a microcolumn placed on-line and the sensing microzone. The intrinsic absorbance of both compounds is monitored directly on the solid phase at 269 nm and so, no derivatization step is required. Using two alternate solutions, 10(-4) M hydrochloric acid and 0.20 M NaAc/HAc (pH 5.0) buffer, the sensor responds linearly in the measuring range of 50-250 and 10-70 microg ml(-1) with detection limits of 9.5 and 0.6 microg ml(-1) (500 microl of sample volume) for SMZ and TMP, respectively. The main advantages of the sensor are simplicity, rapidity and low reagents consumption. Its application to SMZ and TMP determination in synthetic samples and pharmaceutical preparations is demonstrated. The results obtained by the proposed method were compared with those obtained by a standard HPLC method.",M1

A quantitative method using Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 mm i.d. x 150 mm, 4 microns) and tetrahydrofuran(THF)-water (30:70, V/V) as mobile phase with flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and UV 320 nm detector was established. A good linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 0.01 mg.L-1-10 mg.L-1. The detectable limits of trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alpha-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzal)-beta-methoxy-propionitrile were 2.0 micrograms/L and 1.0 microgram/L respectively.

12485347,"Efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfadoxine against Escherichia coli in a tissue cage model in calves.Tissue cages implanted subcutaneously in calves were infected with Escherichia coli. Twenty-four hours later, the calves were treated either with single doses of 2.5 + 12.5 or 5 + 25 mg/kg trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) + sulfadoxine (SDX) or with five doses of 7.5 + 37.5 mg/kg TMP + SDX at 12-h intervals. In addition, one cage in each of three calves in the highest dose group was infected 3 h after initiation of treatment. Untreated calves were kept as controls. Concentrations of TMP and SDX in plasma and tissue cage fluid (TCF) and counts of viable bacteria in TCF were determined. In the highest dose group, concentrations of TMP in TCF remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the test strain for 94-101 h and peak to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio was close to 10. In spite of this, an effect of treatment was noted only in cages infected after initiation of treatment. In vitro studies and analysis of thymidine content in serum and TCF from calves suggest that levels of thymidine in TCF are high enough to antagonize the antibacterial effect of TMP. The results indicate that soft tissue infections in secluded infection sites of calves are refractory to treatment with TMP + SDX.",M1

Six ponies were given an oral TMP/SDZ paste formulation at a dose of 5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SDZ at 12 h intervals for 2 days in order to reach steady-state concentrations. Plasma concentrations and tissue chamber fluid (TCF) concentrations of both drugs were measured at regular intervals during a period commencing 24 h after the last oral administration. The peak concentration of TMP (mean +/- SD) was 2.92 +/- 0.86 microg/mL for plasma and 1.09 +/- 0.25 microg/mL for TCF. For SDZ, the mean peak concentration was 40.20 +/- 14.74 microg/mL for plasma and 23.48 +/- 5.84 microg/mL for TCF. TMP peak concentrations in plasma were reached at 3.17 +/- 03.48 h and those in TCF at 7.33 +/- 03.72 h. SDZ peak concentrations in plasma were reached at 1.83 +/- 02.04 h and those in TCF at 8.00 +/- 03.10 h. Concentrations of TMP and SDZ in TCF remained above the generally accepted breakpoint for susceptibility (0.5/9.5 for the TMP/SDZ combination) for 12 h. Therefore, in ponies oral administration of TMP/SDZ at a dose rate of 30 mg/kg given twice daily in the form of a paste should be appropriate for effective treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria.",M1
12188651,"Epitope mapping of ligand-receptor interactions by diffusion NMR.A novel method based on diffusion NMR for the epitope mapping of ligand binding is presented. The intermolecular NOE builds up during a long diffusion period and creates a deviation from the linearity. The ligand proton nearest the protein generates the strongest NOE from protein during the diffusion period and has the largest deviation. Therefore, this diffusion artifact can be used to characterize the ligand binding epitope. The concept was investigated using dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and its ligand trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>), and the epitope map of TMP on DHFR generated with this method is in excellent agreement with the structural and dynamic studies by crystallography and NMR, as well as the medicinal chemistry results.",M1

12084260,"Practice guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis.The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. Recommendations are that for healthy, adult, nonpregnant women with bacterial cystitis, 3 days of trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMZ) or trimethoprim alone is standard therapy in those regions where less than 10% to 20% of Escherichia coli that cause such infections is resistant to TMP/SMZ. In those regions where resistance is more than 10% to 20%, the committee recommended using an oral fluoroquinolone for 3 days, and that alternatives such as nitrofurantoin for 7 days or fosfomycin as single-dose therapy need more study. These recommendations were established in the late 1990s as resistance to TMP/SMZ among uropathogens was increasing in the United States, a phenomenon earlier observed in other parts of the world. Clinicians should be alert to patients infected with possibly resistant organisms, eg, patients who have recently been hospitalized or are receiving antibiotics.",M1

These drugs have been used as antibacterial against a wide spectrum of organisms and combinations of these drugs are commonly used for the treatment of a variety of infections. The most advantageous approach of this method is the use of HP-beta-CD, which allows to improve the performance of the second-derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry. For both compounds, a shift of the absorption bands and variations of their intensity were observed. The calibration graphs were linear in the concentration range of TMP (1.92-19.2 microg ml(-1)) and SM (1.60-16.5 microg ml(-1)), the correlation coefficient for the calibration graphs was better than 0.9994 and the precision was satisfactory (CV%&lt; 4.96) in HP-beta-CD solutions.

The effects of pH, kind and ionic strength (I) of buffer on capacity factors (k') have been discussed in detail. The capacity factors for TMP increased with increasing pH of both acetate and phosphate buffers. The effects of ionic strength on capacity factors were very substantial and the linear relationship between logk' and logI was described by the equation logk'=0.3162-0.4420logI with R=-0.9995. The results showed that pH 3.5 acetate buffer (0.05 mol L(-1)) containing 0.1 mol L(-1) sodium chloride and a 1:9 ratio of buffer to methanol were the optimum conditions for separation and determination of TMP.

Risk factors for resistance and the impact on clinical failure have been poorly described. We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis seen at a university health center and at primary care clinics in southeastern Michigan from 1992 to 1999. The prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance increased from 8.1% to 15.8% (P=.01). Women who had taken TMP-SMX recently were &gt;16 times as likely as women who had not taken antibiotics recently to be infected with an isolate resistant to this agent; those who had taken any other antibiotic were more than twice as likely to be infected with a resistant isolate. Women infected with a TMP-SMX-resistant isolate who were treated with TMP-SMX were &gt;17 times as likely to have treatment failure. Recent antibiotic use is a risk factor for infection with a TMP-SMX-resistant isolate; patients who are infected with a TMP-SMX-resistant isolate and who are treated with this agent are at a higher risk for clinical failure.",M1

The aim of the study was to follow the immune response after vaccination with simultaneous drug treatment. The fish were immunised with a commercial oil-based divalent (furunculosis/vibriosis) vaccine and were simultaneously given oral drug treatment. The specific immune response was monitored by analysing the levels of specific antibodies with ELISA. As indicators of the nonspecific immune response, the lysozyme activity of serum was measured and the phagocytic activity of circulating leucocytes was monitored by a chemiluminescence assay. Total circulating leucocyte counts and differentials were also monitored. The disease resistance was evaluated by challenge tests at the end of the experiment. The results indicate that SDZ/TMP at a ratio of 5:1 does not interfere negatively with the immune response in rainbow trout after vaccination. A slight stimulation in the antibody response as well as in the chemiluminescence response of circulating granulocytes was recorded in fish treated with the drugs in connection with vaccination. The drugs did not significantly affect the survival after challenge.",M1

This paper describes a method for their determination in veterinary liquid feed premixes that is based on liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Gradient elution with methanol and ammonium acetate achieved excellent separation of the two analytes within 15 min without any interference from the matrix. Absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 264 nm for SMZ and at 230 nm for TMP. Detailed analyses of the uncertainties of determinations afford estimated expanded uncertainties of, respectively, 0.2 and 0.1 w/v % for typical SMZ and TMP concentrations of 10.7 and 2.1 w/v %, respectively. At the lower end of the calibrated range of the method, the dominant source of uncertainty is the preparation of standards and the construction of the calibration line.",M1

The MICs study was performed for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sp. strains. The SDZ concentrations in milk were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and TMP using a microbiological assay. Ten lactating cows milked three times daily were used in the time-concentration studies of TMP-SDZ. Milk samples (approximately 20 mL) from the treated mammary quarters were taken at 6, 12, 24, 30 and 36 h after first administration. In order to define the withdrawal time, milk samples from the treated mammary quarters were taken at 24, 36, 48, 72, 84 and 96 h, after finishing the therapy. The MICs fluctuated between 1 and 8 microg/mL. Effective therapeutic concentrations lasted for 36 h when intramammary infusion was repeated three times every 12 h. No TMP was detected in milk for 24 h after finishing therapy. Milk SDZ concentrations were below 0.1 microg/mL in all treated cows after 84 h finishing therapy.

CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old Asian woman developed a severe, desquamating mucocutaneous reaction (TEN) after six days of taking TMP/SMX to treat a presumed urinary tract infection (UTI). DISCUSSION: TMP/SMX is often recommended as first-line therapy for UTIs, sinusitis, bronchitis, and as prophylaxis and treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. TEN is a rare, but severe condition associated with sulfonamide use. This article describes a typical case and offers an opportunity for review of this potentially serious reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfonamides are often implicated in the majority of drug-induced cases of TEN. This case report illustrates the typical presentation of sulfonamide-induced TEN with a prodrome, characteristic rash, mucous membrane lesions, and systemic involvement. Practitioners should be aware of this rare adverse effect and closely observe patients for cutaneous manifestations or complaints. Any suspected drug should be discontinued if clinical evaluation leads to the suspicion of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN.",M1

In each of five experiments, six pigs were given medicated feed twice daily and three pigs received antibiotic-free feed and served as positive (unmedicated, infected) controls. The following drugs or drug combinations were tested (in mg per kg feed): 500 SDM + 100 TMP, 500 SMX + 100 TMP, 125 SMX + 25 TMP, 125 SMX (alone) and 25 TMP (alone). After six days of feed medication, all animals were endobronchially inoculated with A. pleuropneumoniae in a dose of 1-3.10(4) colony-forming units (CFU). The response to the challenge in all control pigs was characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, reduced water consumption, and laboured breathing. At autopsy all controls manifested a fibrinous haemorrhagic pleuropneumonia. In-feed medication with 500 SDM + 100 TMP, 500 SMX + 100 TMP as well as 125 SMX + 25 TMP resulted in an effective protection against the challenge in all treated animals. After consumption of feed medicated with 125 mg per kg SMX or 25 mg per kg TMP, pleuropneumonia was evident in all challenged pigs.

In addition, high-performance liquid chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry was used for the confirmation of the identity of the analytes of interest. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Spherisorb ODS-2 column (250 x 4.6 mm id, dp 5 microns). The mobile phase for SDA analysis consisted of 1% acetic acid in water-acetonitrile (85 + 15, v/v). For TMP analysis a 80 + 15 + 5 (v/v/v) mixture of 0.25% triethylammonium acetate in water, acetonitrile and methanol was used as the eluent. Sulfamerazine and ormethoprim were used as the internal standards for SDA and TMP analysis, respectively. For the isolation of the compounds of interest from biological samples, a liquid-liquid extraction with acetone and ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up using a solid-phase extraction column (aminopropyl and benzenesulfonic acid for SDA, benzenesulfonic acid for TMP) was performed. Calibration graphs were prepared for all tissues and linearity was achieved over the concentration ranges tested (50-1000 ng g-1 for SDA, r &gt; or = 0.9979; 25-500 ng g-1 for TMP, r &gt; or = 0.9994). The method was validated at the maximum residue level (MRL, 100 ng g-1 for SDA and 50 ng g-1 for TMP), at half the MRL and at double the MRL for both SDA and TMP. The accuracy and precision (expressed as the within-day repeatability) were found to be within the required ranges for each specific concentration. The quantification limits were 50 ng g-1 for SDA and 25 ng g-1 for TMP. The limits of detection were below one half the MRLs. Both methods were selective for the determination of SDA and TMP. Biological samples (kidney, liver, muscle, fat and fat + skin) from pigs that received a commercial SDA-TMP preparation with the feed for five consecutive days (dose rate: 25 mg SDA and 5 mg TMP kg body weight-1 day-1) were analyzed using the described methods.

10760841,"Molecular modelling of trimethoprim complexes of human wild-type and mutant dihydrofolate reductases: identification of two subsets of binding residues in the antifolate binding site.Computer-assisted molecular modelling was used to generate structures for the trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>):NADPH:dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) ternary complexes for human wild-type DHFR and for five DHFR mutants (L22R, L22F, F31S, F31W and Q35P). The mutants correspond to DHFR proteins that have been isolated from tissues exposed to chronic or high dose methotrexate (MTX) and show decreased sensitivity to antifolate inhibition. Analysis of the TMP:DHFR interactions suggest the presence of two subsets of TMP binding residues in the DHFR antifolate binding site. One subset of these residues (GLU30, PHE34, ILE60 and VAL115) are common to each DHFR complex studied and are referred to as core residues. The other TMP binding residues vary among the DHFR complexes studied and are referred to as noncore residues. The core residues exhibit a greater number of TMP contacts/residue and form more stable TMP interactions than noncore residues. Additionally, the core and noncore residues make contact with different regions of the TMP structure. Information presented here provides additional insight into the design of new agents for the improved inhibition of wild-type DHFR and the simultaneous inhibition of both wild-type and mutant DHFR molecules.",M1

SMPD) and that of the species with 1.5 molecules of water of crystallization (TMP.SMPD.W) are reported in this article. X-ray powder diffraction patterns (both computer generated and experimental) and thermal analytical data from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry useful for the characterization of TMP.SMPD and TMP.SMPD.W are provided. The stability of TMP.SMPD.W, which retains its crystallographic order under 0% relative humidity (RH) conditions at room temperature (22 degrees C) and 20 mmHg, is accounted for in terms of crystal structure and hydrogen bonding. Transformation of TMP.SMPD to the hydrate complex by exposure to approximately 100% RH, suspension in water, and wet granulation, and dehydration of TMP.SMPD.W by thermal treatment and by desiccation with methanol were investigated and tentatively interpreted in terms of crystal properties. Interactions in the physical mixture of TMP and SMPD by grinding, compression, heating, and contact with water were also studied. Water-mediated formation of TMP.SMPD.W by wetting and metastable eutectic melting-mediated formation of TMP.SMPD by heating was demonstrated.

Although various prophylactic regimens have been used in this setting to prevent active infection, their efficacy, toxicity profile, and impact on outcomes are poorly described in this patient group. We undertook a retrospective cohort study in which we reviewed the records of 451 adult patients who underwent BMT for hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, or myelodysplasia over a 7-year period at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Post-BMT PCP prophylaxis consisted of aerosolized pentamidine (AP) 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg per month, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX) 160/800 mg orally b.i.d. 3 times per week, or dapsone 100 mg orally each day. Prophylaxis was continued for 1 year post-BMT in all patients when clinically feasible. One hundred twenty-one patients were unevaluable because of death or relapse &lt;60 days after BMT (n = 89), loss to follow-up upon hospital discharge (n = 20), or other reasons (n = 12). Three eligible patients did not receive any prophylaxis and were not further evaluated. Of the 327 patients analyzed, 133 underwent autologous BMT, 4 syngeneic BMT, 159 related allogeneic BMT, and 31 unrelated allogeneic BMT. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in the 190 patients receiving allogeneic BMT consisted of T-cell depletion with anti-CD5 and complement in 58 patients and cyclosporine/methotrexate or FK506 with or without steroids in 132 patients. Eight of 327 (2.4%) documented PCP cases were identified, 0 of 105 in patients receiving only TMP/SMX. Four cases occurred in patients receiving only AP (4/44, 9.1%; odds ratio [OR] relative to TMP/SMX 23.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 445.2); 1 in patients receiving only dapsone (1/31, 3.2%; OR not significant); 2 in patients receiving more than 1 prophylactic regimen (2/147 1.4%; OR not significant); and 1 &gt;1 year post-BMT in a patient who was off PCP prophylaxis. Although the patients receiving only AP had a significantly lower probability of treatment-related toxicity than those receiving TMP/SMX (OR 0.19 [95% CI 0.04, 0.851), the probability of their acquiring other serious non-PCP infections was increased (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.0, 4.6]), and the probability of their dying by 1 year post-BMT was significantly higher (OR 5.2 [95% CI 2.4, 26.6]), even when adjusted for variables such as type of BMT (autologous versus allogeneic; high versus low risk) and sex. Although AP is associated with fewer toxicities, the data show that it is inferior to TMP/SMX in preventing PCP in the post-BMT setting and is associated with an increased risk of other infections and a higher mortality at 1 year after BMT.",M1
10625463,"Characterization of rates of ring-flipping in trimethoprim in its ternary complexes with Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase and coenzyme analogues.NMR measurements have been used to investigate rates of ring-flipping and the activation parameters for the trimethoxybenzyl ring of the antibacterial drug trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) bound to Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) for a series of ternary complexes formed with analogues of the coenzyme NADPH. Rates were obtained at several temperatures from line shape analyses ((13)C-edited HSQC (1)H spectra) and transfer of magnetization measurements (zz-HSQC) on complexes containing 3'-O-[(13)C]trimethoprim. Examination of the structures of the complexes indicates that ring-flipping can only be achieved following major conformational changes and transient fluctuations of the protein and coenzyme structure around the trimethoxybenzyl ring. There is no simple correlation between rates of ring-flipping and binding constants. The presence of the coenzyme nicotinamide ring (in either its reduced or its oxidized forms) in the binding site close to the trimethoxybenzyl ring moiety is the major factor reducing the ring-flipping on coenzyme binding. Thus, the ternary complex with NADPH shows the largest reduction in the rate of ring-flipping (11 +/- 3 s(-)(1) at 298 K) as compared with the binary complex (793 +/- 80 s(-)(1) at 298 K). Complexes with NADPH analogues that either have no nicotinamide ring or are known to have their nicotinamide rings removed from the binding site show the smallest reductions. For the DHFR.TMP.NADP(+) complex where there are two conformations present, very different rates of ring-flipping were observed for the two forms. The activation parameters (DeltaH() and DeltaS()) for the ring-flipping in all the complexes are discussed in terms of the protein-ligand interactions and the possible constraints on the pathway through the transition state.",M1
10563403,"Evaluation of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole as monotherapy or in combination in the management of toxoplasmosis in murine models.The combination of trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) and sulphamethoxazole (SMX) is commonly used for the prevention of cerebral toxoplasmosis although there is no firm experimental basis to support this regimen. We used strain RH tachyzoites for challenge in the acute murine model of toxoplasmosis and found that TMP administered as a single agent, failed to eradicate toxoplasma even at the highest dose (70 mg/kg per day). SMX alone at 600 mg/kg per day, protected ten out of ten mice, although inoculation of brain from surviving animals to naive mice resulted in the development of an encephalitis. When combined, TMP (60 mg/kg per day) and SMX (300 mg/kg per day) protected ten out of ten mice and gave a 'cure' in four out of four mice. In the chronic cystogenic murine models, the combination TMP plus SMX administered from day 5 for 15 days or from day 28 for 288 days, gave protection and even apparent toxoplasmal eradication ('cure') at the highest dosing (60/300 mg/kg per day). However, microscopic severe encephalitis was found in mice classified as 'cured' after reinoculation. This result makes the interpretation of 'cure' very difficult. In conclusion TMP and SMX act synergistically, SMX being the more active arm of the combination. The combination was efficient in preventing the lethal development of chronic toxoplasma encephalitis, but did not guarantee complete recovery.",M1
10509852,"Economic assessment of three antimicrobial therapies for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women.This retrospective cohort study used North Carolina Medicaid paid-claims data to assess clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for urinary tract infection (UTI). The study population comprised female Medicaid recipients, between 15 and 64 years of age, with a paid claim filed for a primary diagnosis of UTI or acute UTI from January 1 to June 30, 1994, who were treated with ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMZ). Patients had follow-up for 6 months after the primary diagnosis. Patients who did not receive further treatment for UTI with 1 of the 3 drugs within 30 days after initial treatment were assumed to be cured. Costs were measured as the sum of reimbursements for UTI-related medical services and drug treatments. Outcomes for 409 patients were assessed. Cure rates of initial treatment with ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and TMP/SMZ were 81%, 88%, and 93%, respectively. Cost-effectiveness ratios of initial treatment with the 3 drugs were $150.80, $81.20, and $69.00, respectively. When efficacy rates generated from published randomized clinical studies were applied, cost-effectiveness ratios for the 3 drugs were $130.96, $86.17, and $72.00, respectively. A decision model of treatment pattern and associated costs is presented. Several patient variables indicate that the ciprofloxacin group included more severe cases of UTI than did the other groups. Study limitations, confounders, and future research suggestions are discussed. Our results show that treatment for &gt;7 days results in a better cure rate regardless of the drug used than does treatment for &lt; or =7 days and that TMP/SMZ is the most cost-effective of the 3 drugs for UTI or acute UTI.",M1
10332530,"Therapeutic failure of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of failure of treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX) in a patient with HIV infection, despite an adequate serum SMX concentration. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old white man was treated with TMP/SMX for PCP. After discharge he returned to the hospital with worsening of the PCP despite a serum SMX concentration of 60 micrograms/mL 18 hours after his last dose of TMP/SMX. DISCUSSION: PCP is one of the most common complications of HIV infection. TMP/SMX is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and treatment. The causes of therapeutic failure with this agent are not well documented. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative therapies to TMP/SMX should be seriously considered if the serum concentrations are therapeutic and the patient is not clinically improved.",M1
10211713,"Repeated administration of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine in the horse--pharmacokinetics, plasma protein binding and influence on the intestinal microflora.Six healthy adult horses were given repeated administrations of trimethoprim/ sulfadiazine (<e>TMP</e>/SDZ) intravenously (i.v.) (2.5 mg/kg TMP and 12.5 mg/kg SDZ) and orally (p.o.) as a paste (5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SDZ). Both formulations were given twice daily for 5 days, with a 3-week interval between i.v. and oral administration. The influence of the drug combination on the intestinal microflora was examined and the plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma protein binding were determined. There were no major changes in the bacterial intestinal flora and no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal disturbances following the i.v. and oral TMP/SDZ administration. An initial reduction in the number of coliform bacteria during the treatment was notable, though with no evident difference between i.v. and oral treatment. The minimum concentration during a dose interval at steady state (Cminss), the elimination half-life (t1/2beta) and the mean residence time (MRT) were significantly greater after oral administration compared to i.v. for both TMP and SDZ. The plasma protein binding was measured to be 20% for SDZ and 35% for TMP. Oral administration of TMP/SDZ in a dose of 30 mg/kg given twice daily in the form of paste appeared as a satisfactory method for obtaining plasma levels above MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration in vitro) values during the interdosing interval.",M1
10100312,"Influence of crystal habit on trimethoprim suspension formulation.PURPOSE: The role of crystal habit in influencing the physical stability and pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim suspensions was examined. METHODS: Different habits for trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) were obtained by recrystallizing the commercial sample (PD) utilizing solvent-change precipitation method. Four distinct habits (microscopic observation) belonging to the same polymorphic state (DSC studies) were selected for studies. Preformulation and formulation studies were carried out on suspension dosage forms containing these crystals. The freshly prepared suspensions were also evaluated for their pharmacokinetic behaviour on healthy human volunteers using a cross over study. RESULTS: Variation of crystallization conditions produces different habits of TMP. Among the different crystal habits exhibiting same polymorphic state, the most anisometric crystal showed best physical stability in terms of sedimentation volume and redispersibility. However, habit did not significantly affect the extent of TMP excreted in urine. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of surface morphology without significantly altering the polymorphic state can be utilized for improving physical stability of TMP suspensions. However, the pharmacokinetic profile remains unaltered.",M1
9915108,"Efficacy of long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy in a boy with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.A boy with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIE syndrome), who was successfully treated with long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-<e>TMP</e>) is reported. He had been suffering from recurrent pruritic dermatitis soon after birth and had a significant high level of serum immunoglobulin E. Although an initiation of SMX-TMP therapy resulted in resolution of his clinical manifestations, cessation of the treatment exacerbated the symptoms. Chemoprophylaxis of other oral antibiotics, which were suitable for Staphylococcus aureus isolated from lesions of the patient were unsuccessful. Another trial of low-dose SMX-TMP therapy resulted in gradual subsidence of the clinical manifestations. From these observations, efficacy of SMX-TMP therapy to prevent bacterial infection in the patient is clinically apparent. Although precise mechanism of the therapy remains speculative, long-term SMX-TMP therapy might be of benefit and low clinical toxicity in HIE syndrome.",M1
9813398,"Rifaximin: a nonabsorbed antimicrobial in the therapy of travelers' diarrhea.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial enteropathogens, the major cause of travelers' diarrhea, are customarily treated with antibacterial drugs. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbed antimicrobial was examined as treatment for travelers' diarrhea. METHODS: A randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in 72 US adults in Mexico. Patients with acute diarrhea received one of three doses of rifaximin (200, 400 and 600 mg t.i.d.) or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (<e>TMP</e>/SMX, 160 mg/800 mg b.i.d.) for 5 days. Results were compared with data from 2 placebo-treated historical control populations. RESULTS: The shortest duration of treated diarrhea was seen in the group receiving 200 mg rifaximin t. i.d (NS). Clinical failure to respond to treatment occurred in 6 of 55 (11%) rifaximin-treated subjects versus 5 of 17 (29%) of TMP/SMX-treated subjects (NS). Sixteen of twenty (80%) of the enteropathogens isolated from the rifaximin-treated subjects and 7 of 7 (100%) from the TMP/SMX group were eradicated by treatment (NS). Sixteen of twenty-four (67%) enteropathogens identified were susceptible to TMP and all 24 were inhibited by&lt;/=50 microgram/ml of rifaximin. Rifaximin reduced the number of unformed stools passed during the first 24 h of treatment when compared with 2 control placebo groups (3.3 versus 5.1; p = 0.008 and 0.0001) and led to a reduced duration of post-enrollment diarrhea (mean values of 43.1 versus 68.1 and 81.9 h; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin shortened the duration of travelers' diarrhea compared with TMP/SMX and 2 earlier studied placebo-treated groups. A poorly absorbed drug if effective in treating bacterial diarrhea has pharmacologic and safety advantages over the existing drugs.",M1
9737024,"[Experiences with the rectal use of chemotherapeutic agents. 2. Pharmacokinetic examinations with animals]The aim of the investigations was to optimise vehicle for trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>) suppositories ready for clinical trials. The rectal absorption of TMP was studied in anaesthetized rats. The drug liberation properties of the five mixed vehicles with promising in vitro results (Part 1.) were studied. The course of the blood level curves was monitored with serial sampling. The TMP concentration of blood was determined by bioassay. Individual bases were compared with the use of the pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the analysis of the obtained blood level curves, with special respect to biological availability (BA). The extent of bioavailability is influenced considerably by the hydro-, lipo- or lipohydrophilic property of the vehicle. TMP, if incorporated in the proper vehicle, is absorbed well. With three vehicles the extent of absorption exceeded the absorption seen with oral administration on the same model (BA = 38.8%). The best results were achieved with the lipophilic base Witepsol W 35 containing 10% of Polysorbate 20 and 10% of Polysorbate 61 (BA = 63.8%) and with Witepsol W 35 containing 10% of Polysorbate 60 (BA = 64.9%). The hydrophilic Macrogol 1540 vehicle containing 5% of Macrogol 400 had only slightly worse results (BA = 52.9%). In the case of the lipohydrophilic Witepsol W 35 vehicle with 10% of Polysorbate 20 and 10% of Polysorbate 61 content a significant negative exponential relation was found between the administered doses and their respective bioavailability values, this tendency had been observed during the in vitro examinations, too. No such relation was found in the case of the lipophilic Witepsol W 35 vehicle containing 10% of Miglyol 812.",M1
9719102,"Trimethoprim resistance and susceptibility genes in Staphylococcus epidermidis.Genes encoding trimethoprim (<e>TMP</e>)-resistant and -susceptible dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in Saitama Prefecture were compared with the TMP-resistant DHFR gene of S. aureus, dfrA. The nucleotide sequences of TMPr and TMPs genes in five S. epidermidis isolates tested could be divided into three types: type 1, identical with the TMPr gene dfrA that had been found in S. aureus; type 3, identical with the TMPs gene dfrC in S. epidermidis; and type 2, having only two nucleotide substitutions to dfrC with no amino acid change. TMPr isolates carried either one of the type 2 or type 3 sequences in addition to the type 1 sequence. A Southern hybridization analysis revealed that, in TMPr S. epidermidis, the type 1 sequence was located on a 5.5 kb EcoRI-EcoRV restriction fragment together with the sequence for the gentamicin (GM)-resistant gene, while the type 2 or type 3 sequence was located on the 1.0 kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment. No plasmid-carrying dfrA-homologous sequence was detected in the S. epidermidis isolates we tested. These results suggest that the TMPr and GMr genes are closely linked and located on the chromosome in S. epidermidis isolated in Japan.",M1

The four sulfonamides and TMP were injected intravenously at doses of 20 mg/kg (SDM, SDZ, SMPZ), 12.5 mg/kg (SDMX) and 2.5 mg/kg (TMP). The body clearance (ClB) of SDZ (1.70 +/- 0.14 ml/min/kg) was significantly higher than those of SDM (1.13 +/- 0.18 ml/min/kg), SMPZ (1.10 +/- 0.09 ml/min/kg) and SDMX (0.75 +/- 0.04 ml/min/kg). In contrast, the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was similar for the four sulfonamides (0.68 +/- 0.08 L/kg, 0.63 +/- 0.07 L/kg, 0.47 +/- 0.06 L/kg, and 0.46 +/- 0.05 L/kg for SDM, SDZ, SMPZ and SDMX, respectively). Both ClB and Vss were significantly higher for TMP (4.36 +/- 0.60 ml/min/kg and 2.71 +/- 0.86 L/kg) than for sulfonamides. Antipyrine ClB (3.49 +/- 0.35 ml/min/kg) and Vss (0.66 +/- 0.16 L/kg), determined in order to assess hepatic oxidative function and total body water volume, respectively, were either different from (ClB), or similar to (Vss), values calculated for sulfonamides.

The length of the alkyl bridge between the cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine and trimethoxyphenyl moiety ranged from one in 15a to three carbons in 15c. The products were tested as competitive inhibitors of the reduction of dihydrofolate by Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, and rat liver DHFR. Compounds 15a-c had IC50 values of &gt; 32, 1.8 and 1.3 microM, respectively, against P. carinii DHFR, as compared to 12 microM for TMP. Against the T. gondii enzyme, 15a-c had IC50 values of 21, 0.14 and 0.14 microM, respectively, as compared to 2.7 microM for TMP. Inhibitors 15b and 15c with two- and three-carbon bridges were significantly more potent than 15a against all three enzymes. Unlike TMP, 15b and 15c were better inhibitors of the rat liver enzyme than of the microbial enzymes. The potency of 15b and 15c against rat liver DHFR was less than has been reported for the corresponding 6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidines with a classical p-aminobenzoyl-L-glutamate side chain as inhibitors of bovine, murine, and human DHFR.",M1

This assay allowed the determination of: (i) the intracellular production of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (5-FdUMP) from 5-FU or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (5-FdUrd), (ii) the impact of 5-FdUMP concentration on the intracellular 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP)/thymidine-5'-monophosphate (TMP) ratio, and (iii) the secretion extent of 5-FdUMP and 5-FU from human cultured cells by ABC transporters. Under our experimental conditions, cells were incubated with 5-FU or 5-FUrd. Then, cellular proteins were precipitated by methanol. This procedure provided high extraction recovery. In addition, to measure 5-FU and 5-FdUMP secretion from cells, we carried out quantification of these molecules in culture medium. Media were either directly injected (5-FU) or underwent a solid phase extraction using Oasis Wax extraction cartridge (5-FdUMP). Separation of analytes was performed on a dC18 Atlantis 3.5microm, (100mmx2.1mm i.d) column with isocratic mode using ammonium formate buffer/methanol/water (5/5/90, v/v) as mobile phase. The run time did not exceed 6.2min. The analytes were ionized in an electrospray interface under negative ion mode. We validated the method over a range of 2.5-150ngmL(-1) according to the compounds. Intra- and inter-assay variability was lower than 10% over seven days. All compounds were stable in cells or in culture medium when samples were stored at -20 degrees C for at least two weeks, and after three freeze-thaw cycles. No matrix effect was observed in both media.",M2
19462989,"Biodegradable protections for nucleoside 5'-monophosphates: comparative study on the removal of O-acetyl and O-acetyloxymethyl protected 3-hydroxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl groups.The applicability of 3-acetyloxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl and 3-acetyloxymethoxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl groups as biodegradable phosphate protecting groups for nucleoside 5'-monophosphates has been studied in a HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. Enzymatic deacetylation with porcine carboxyesterase triggers the removal of the resulting 3-hydroxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl and 3-hydroxymethoxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl groups by retro-aldol condensation and consecutive half acetal hydrolysis and retro-aldol condensation, respectively. The kinetics of these multistep deprotection reactions have been followed by HPLC, using appropriately protected thymidine 5'-monophosphates as model compounds. The enzymatic deacetylation of the 3-acetyloxymethoxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl 5'-triester (2) is 25-fold faster than the deacetylation of its 3-acetyloxy-2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl-protected counterpart 1, and the difference in the deacetylation rates of the resulting diesters, 12b and 12a, is even greater. With 2, conversion to thymidine 5'-monophosphate (5'-<e>TMP</e>) is quantitative, while conversion of 1 to 5'-TMP is accompanied by formation of thymidine.

18023590,"Hydrolysis of the 5'-p-nitrophenyl ester of <e>TMP</e> by oligoribonucleases (ORN) from Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and human.Escherichia coli oligoribonuclease (EcoORN), encoded by the orn gene, is a 3'-5' exonuclease that degrades short single-stranded oligoribonucleotides to rNMPs in the final step of RNA degradation. The orn gene is essential in E. coli, but not in higher organisms, and close homologues are present in other genomes from the beta and gamma subdivisions of the Protobacteriaceae, including many pathogenic species. We report here the expression in E. coli of orn and homologues from Mycobacterium smegmatis and human, and large-scale purification of the three enzymes. All three were found to promote the hydrolysis of the 5'-p-nitrophenyl ester of TMP (pNP-TMP) with similar values of Michaelis-Menten parameters (k(cat)=100-650 min(-1), K(M)=0.4-2.0 mM, at pH 8.00 and 25 degrees C, with 1 mM Mn(2+)). Hydrolysis by pNP-TMP by all three enzymes depended on a divalent metal ion, with Mn(2+) being preferred over Mg(2+) as cofactor, and was inhibited by Ni(2+). The concentration dependency of Mn(2+) was examined, giving K(Mn) values of 0.2-0.6 mM. The availability of large amounts of the purified enzymes and a simple spectrophotometric assay for ORN activity should facilitate large-scale screening for new inhibitors of bacterial oligoribonucleases.",M2

Using p-nitrophenyl-5'-thymidine monophosphate (p-Nph-5'-<e>TMP</e>) as substrate for E-NPPs in rat cardiac synaptosomes, we observed an alkaline pH dependence, divalent cation dependence and the K ( M ) value corresponded to 91.42 +/- 13.97 microM and the maximal velocity (V ( max )) value calculated was 63.79 +/- 3.59 nmol p-nitrophenol released/min/mg of protein (mean +/- SD, n = 4). Levamisole (1 mM), was ineffective as inhibitor of p-Nph-5'-TMP hydrolysis in pH 8.9 (optimum pH for the enzyme characterized). Suramin (0.25 mM) strongly reduced the hydrolysis of p-Nph-5'-TMP by about 46%. Sodium azide (10 and 20 mM) and gadolinium chloride (0.3 and 0.5 mM), E-NTPases inhibitors, had no effects on p-Nph-5'-TMP hydrolysis. RT-PCR analysis of left ventricle demonstrated the expression of NPP2 and NPP3 enzymes, but excluded the presence of NPP1 member. By quantitative real-time PCR we identified the NPP3 as the enzyme with the highest expression in rat left ventricle. The demonstration of the presence of the E-NPP family in cardiac system, suggest that these enzymes could contribute with the fine-tuning control of the nucleotide levels at the nerve terminal endings of left ventricles that are involved in several cardiac pathologies.",M2
17603550,"Specificity of the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL 67156 on human and mouse ectonucleotidases.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: ARL 67156, 6-N,N-Diethyl-D-beta-gamma-dibromomethylene adenosine triphosphate, originally named FPL 67156, is the only commercially available inhibitor of ecto-ATPases. Since the first report on this molecule, various ectonucleotidases responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP at the cell surface have been cloned and characterized. In this work, we identified the ectonucleotidases inhibited by ARL 67156. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of ARL 67156 on recombinant NTPDase1, 2, 3 &amp; 8 (mouse and human), NPP1, NPP3 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase (human) have been evaluated. The inhibition of the activity of NTPDases (using the following substrates: ATP, ADP, UTP), NPPs (pnp-<e>TMP</e>, Ap(3)A) and ecto-5'-nucleotidase (AMP) was measured by colorimetric or HPLC assays. KEY RESULTS: ARL 67156 was a weak competitive inhibitor of human NTPDase1, NTPDase3 and NPP1 with K(i) of 11+/-3, 18+/-4 and 12+/-3 microM, respectively. At concentrations used in the literature (50-100 microM), ARL 67156 partially but significantly inhibited the mouse and human forms of these enzymes. NTPDase2, NTPDase8, NPP3 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase activities were less affected. Importantly, ARL 67156 was not hydrolysed by either human NTPDase1, 2, 3, 8, NPP1 or NPP3. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In cell environments where NTPDase1, NTPDase3, NPP1 or mouse NTPDase8 are present, ARL 67156 would prolong the effect of endogenously released ATP on P2 receptors. However, it does not block any ectonucleotidases efficiently when high concentrations of substrates are present, such as in biochemical, pharmacological or P2X(7) assays. In addition, ARL 67156 is not an effective inhibitor of NTPDase2, human NTPDase8, NPP3 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase.",M2
16421009,"Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase as part of a multiple system for nucleotide hydrolysis by platelets from rats: kinetic characterization and biochemical properties.In this study, we describe an ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (E-NPP) activity in rat platelets. Using p-nitrophenyl 5'-thymidine monophosphate (p-Nph-5'-<e>TMP</e>) as a substrate for E-NPP, we demonstrate an enzyme activity that shares the major biochemical properties described for E-NPPs: alkaline pH dependence, divalent cation dependence and blockade of activity by metal ion chelator. K(m) and V(max) values for p-Nph-5'-TMP hydrolysis were found to be 106 +/- 18 microM and 3.44 +/- 0.18 nmol p-nitrophenol/min/mg (mean +/- SD, n = 5). We hypothesize that an E-NPP is co-localized with an ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase and an ecto-5'-nucleotidase on the platelet surface, as part of a multiple system for nucleotide hydrolysis, since they can act under distinct physiological conditions and can be differently regulated. Thus, 0.25 mM suramin inhibited p-Nph-5'-TMP, ATP and ADP hydrolysis, while 0.5 mM AMP decreased only p-Nph-5'-TMP hydrolysis. Besides, 5.0, 10 and 20 mM sodium azide just inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis. Angiotensin II (5.0 and 10 nM) affected only ADP hydrolysis. Gadolinium chloride (0.2 and 0.5 mM) strongly inhibited the ATP and ADP hydrolysis. The E-NPP described here represents a novel insight into the control of platelet purinergic signaling.",M2
15880557,"Simultaneous determination of thymidylate and thymidine diphosphate by capillary electrophoresis as a rapid monitoring tool for thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase activities.A simple and rapid capillary electrophoretic method was developed for the simultaneous determination of thymidylate (<e>TMP</e>) and thymidine 5'-diphosphate (TDP) in enzyme assays without using radioactive-labeled substrates. Prior to electrophoretic separation, addition of acetonitrile and sodium chloride to the assay solution and brief centrifugation are recommended for the purpose of sample cleanup and sample stacking. The separation of micromolar TMP and TDP from millimolar adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was performed at 25 degrees C using sodium tetraborate as the background electrolyte. Under the optimal condition, a good separation with high efficiency was achieved in 6 min. Several parameters affecting the separation were studied, including the pH of electrolyte, the applied voltage, and acetonitrile-salt sample stacking. The fronting of the ATP peak resulting from the interference of magnesium ion in the enzyme assay buffer was suppressed by the addition of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate to the sample solution. Using deoxyadenylate as an internal standard, the linear range of the method was 5-200 microM, and the concentration limits of detection of TMP and TDP were 2.6 and 3.8 microM, respectively. Application of the proposed method for simultaneous determination of TMP and TDP in enzyme assays was demonstrated by the activity assays of thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase from white spot syndrome virus. This is a sensitive, nonradioactive method for thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase assays.",M2
15826601,"Bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) thymidine 5'-phosphate is a cell membrane-permeable precursor of thymidine 5'-phosphate in thymidine kinase deficient CCRF CEM cells.Bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) thymidine 5-phosphate (POM(2)-dTMP) has been investigated as a membrane-permeable prodrugs of dTMP. The growth inhibitory activity of POM(2)-<e>TMP</e> has been compared with thymidine (TdR) in wild type CCRF CEM cells (CEM) and a strain that lacks TdR kinase (CEM tk-). After 72 h incubation at 37 degrees C, TdR showed significant antiproliferative activity (IC(50)=27 microM) against CEM cells but was weakly effective (IC(50)=730 microM) against the mutant cell line. By comparison, bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) thymidine 5'-monophosphate (POM(2)-dTMP) was equally inhibitory (IC(50)=5 microM) to both cell lines. The growth inhibitory effects were reversed by deoxycytidine. Cellular [methyl-(3)H]dTTP pools increased linearly over 2h during incubation of CEM or CEM tk- with 5 microM POM(2)-[methyl-(3)H]dTMP. The incorporation of [methyl-(3)H]TdR into HClO(4)-insoluble cell residue by CEM tk- was &lt;0.1% that of CEM and did not increase over 1h. In contrast, CEM tk- incorporated radioactivity from POM(2)-dTMP into acid insoluble residue at a rate 59% that of CEM. These results demonstrate that POM(2)-dTMP can penetrate into cells and serve as a source of dTMP.",M2
14574703,"One-pot enzymatic production of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose from dTMP and glucose-1-phosphate.An enzymatic production method for dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose, a key intermediate of various deoxysugars in antibiotics, was developed starting from dTMP, acetyl phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate. Four enzymes, i.e., <e>TMP</e> kinase, acetate kinase, dTDP-glucose synthase, and dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase' were overexpressed using T7 promoter system in the E. coli BL21 strain, and the dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was synthesized by using the enzyme extracts in one-pot batch system. When 20 mM dTMP of initial concentration was used, Mg2+ ion, acetyl phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate concentrations were optimized. About 95% conversion yield of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was obtained based on initial dTMP concentration at 20 mM dTMP, 1 mM ATP, 60 mM acetyl phosphate, 80 mM glucose-1-phosphate, and 20 mM MgCl(2). The rate-limiting step in this multiple enzyme reaction system was the dTDP-glucose synthase reaction. Using the reaction scheme, about 1 gram of purified dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was obtained in an overall yield of 81% after two-step purification, i.e., anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration.",M2

Their fluorescence quantum yields (&lt; 1%) were much weaker than that of unsubstituted pyrene and their fluorescence lifetime of the major decay components were less than 1 ns. The rapid fluorescence quenching was due to the interaction between the fluorophore and bases in the oligonucleotides. The fluorescence of pyrene was quenched efficiently by <e>TMP</e> and slightly by AMP. The quenching by CMP and GMP were the intermediate case.",M2
12614151,"Structures of human thymidylate kinase in complex with prodrugs: implications for the structure-based design of novel compounds.Nucleoside analogue prodrugs are dependent on efficient intracellular stepwise phosphorylation to their triphosphate form to become therapeutically active. In many cases it is this activation pathway that largely determines the efficacy of the drug. To gain further understanding of the determinants for efficient conversion by the enzyme thymidylate kinase (TMPK) of clinically important thymidine monophosphate analogues to the corresponding diphosphates, we solved the crystal structures of the enzyme, with either ADP or the ATP analogue AppNHp at the phosphoryl donor site, in complex with <e>TMP</e>, AZTMP (previous work), NH2TMP, d4TMP, ddTMP, and FLTMP (this work) at the phosphoryl acceptor site. In conjunction with steady-state kinetic data, our structures shed light on the effect of 3'-substitutions in the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) sugar moiety on the catalytic rate. We observe a direct correlation between the rate of phosphorylation of an NMP and its ability to induce a closing of the enzyme's phosphate-binding loop (P-loop). Our results show the drastic effects that slight modifications of the substrates exert on the enzyme's conformation and, hence, activity and suggest the type of substitutions that are compatible with efficient phosphorylation by TMPK.",M2
12515520,"Highly selective binding of organometallic ruthenium ethylenediamine complexes to nucleic acids: novel recognition mechanisms.We have investigated the recognition of nucleic acid derivatives by organometallic ruthenium(II) arene anticancer complexes of the type [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(II)(en)X] where en = ethylenediamine, arene = biphenyl (Bip), tetrahydroanthracene (THA), dihydroanthracene (DHA), p-cymene (Cym) or benzene (Ben), X = Cl(-) or H(2)O using (1)H, (31)P and (15)N ((15)N-en) NMR spectroscopy. For mononucleosides, [(eta(6)-Bip)Ru(en)](2+) binds only to N7 of guanosine, to N7 and N1 of inosine, and to N3 of thymidine. Binding to N3 of cytidine was weak, and almost no binding to adenosine was observed. The reactivity of the various binding sites of nucleobases toward Ru at neutral pH decreased in the order G(N7) &gt; I(N7) &gt; I(N1), T(N3) &gt; C(N3) &gt; A(N7), A(N1). Therefore, pseudo-octahedral diamino Ru(II) arene complexes are much more highly discriminatory between G and A bases than square-planar Pt(II) complexes. Such site-selectivity appears to be controlled by the en NH(2) groups, which H-bond with exocyclic oxygens but are nonbonding and repulsive toward exocyclic amino groups of the nucleobases. For reactions with mononucleotides, the same pattern of site selectivity was observed, but, in addition, significant amounts of the 5'-phosphate-bound species (40-60%) were present at equilibrium for 5'-<e>TMP</e>, 5'-CMP and 5'-AMP. In contrast, no binding to the phosphodiester groups of 3', 5'-cyclic-GMP (cGMP) or cAMP was detected. Reactions with nucleotides proceeded via aquation of [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(en)Cl](+), followed by rapid binding to the 5'-phosphate, and then rearrangement to give N7, N1, or N3-bound products. Small amounts of the dinuclear species, e.g., Ru-O(PO(3))GMPN7-Ru, Ru-O(PO(3))IMPN1-Ru, Ru-O(PO(3))TMPN3-Ru, Ru-N7IMPN1-Ru, and Ru-N7InoN1-Ru were also detected. In competitive binding experiments for [(eta(6)-Bip)Ru(en)Cl](+) with 5'-GMP versus 5'-AMP or 5'-CMP or 5'-TMP, the only final adduct was [(eta(6)-Bip)Ru(en)(N7-GMP)]. Ru-H(2)O species were more reactive than Ru-OH species. The presence of Cl(-) or phosphate in neutral solution significantly decreased the rates of Ru-N7 binding through competitive coordination to Ru. In kinetic studies (pH 7.0, 298 K, 100 mM NaClO(4)), the rates of reaction of cGMP with [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(II)(en)X](n+) (X = Cl(-) or H(2)O) decreased in the order: THA &gt; Bip &gt; DHA &gt;&gt; Cym &gt; Ben, suggesting that N7-binding is promoted by favorable arene-purine hydrophobic interactions in the associative transition state. These findings have revealed that the diamine NH(2) groups, the hydrophobic arene, and the chloride leaving group have important roles in the novel mechanism of recognition of nucleic acids by Ru arene complexes, and will aid the design of more effective anticancer complexes, as well as new site-specific DNA reagents.",M2
12067500,"Can a mixed damage interfere with DNA-protein cross-links repair?Some photochemical and photobiological properties of 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (<e>TMP</e>) have been studied in comparison with 1,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2H-furo[2,3-h]quinolin-2 one (FQ) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP). TMP and FQ can photobind to mammalian cell DNA in vivo, by UVA irradiation, forming DNA-protein cross-links (DPC), but only TMP shows a strong capacity of inducing interstrand cross-links (ISC). The mechanism of DPC formation was studied using the double irradiation method in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and DPC were detected by alkaline elution. Both TMP and FQ induce covalent diadducts linking together DNA and proteins. Studying the formation of double strand breaks (DSB) in CHO cells we observed that TMP induced a low amount of DSB, similar to 8-MOP. TMP and 8-MOP induced chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells to the same extent, while FQ appeared to be more active. Our data suggest that the ISC induced by TMP could trap enzymes involved in DPC repair.",M2
11961053,"Biochemical and behavioral characterization of novel methylphenidate analogs.As part of a project to develop treatment agents for cocaine abuse, (+/-)-threo-methylphenidate (<e>TMP</e>) and 11 analogs were characterized biochemically and behaviorally to assess their potential as anti-cocaine medications. The compounds contained aryl and/or nitrogen substitutions, and/or replacement of the ester function by an alcohol or ether. All of the analogs, except for the N-methyl-substituted compounds, showed increased inhibitory potency against (3)H-(-)-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate ([(3)H]WIN 35,428) ([(3)H]WIN) binding to the dopamine transporter, compared with TMP. In general, parallel results were obtained for inhibition of [(3)H]dopamine ([(3)H]DA) uptake. Although compounds with N-substitutions were proportionally less potent at blocking DA uptake than WIN binding (compared with the unsubstituted compounds), one such compound that was 6-fold more potent against [(3)H]WIN binding than [(3)H]DA uptake did not attenuate inhibition by cocaine of synaptosomal [(3)H]DA transport. The compounds were significantly less potent in displacing [(3)H]citalopram binding from the serotonin transporter. In cocaine discrimination studies in rats, all but two of the analogs (both N-substituted) completely generalized with the cocaine stimulus. Robust positive correlations were observed between potency in the drug discrimination assay and activity at the dopamine transporter, but not the serotonin transporter. When tested for their ability to alter cocaine discrimination, four of the analogs (three of which had N-substitutions and shallow dose-response curves as cocaine substitutes) actually enhanced cocaine discrimination, often at combined doses of cocaine and test compound that were inactive when given separately. Taken together, the results suggest that TMP analogs may have potential as substitution therapies for the treatment of cocaine abuse.",M2
11955076,"Hydrolysis of the 5'-p-nitrophenyl ester of <e>TMP</e> by the proofreading exonuclease (epsilon) subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III.The core of DNA polymerase III, the replicative polymerase in Escherichia coli, consists of three subunits (alpha, epsilon, and theta). The epsilon subunit is the 3'-5' proofreading exonuclease that associates with the polymerase (alpha) through its C-terminal region and theta through a 185-residue N-terminal domain (epsilon 186). A spectrophotometric assay for measurement of epsilon activity is described. Proteins epsilon and epsilon 186 and the epsilon 186.theta complex catalyzed the hydrolysis of the 5'-p-nitrophenyl ester of TMP (pNP-TMP) with similar values of k(cat) and K(M), confirming that the N-terminal domain of epsilon bears the exonuclease active site, and showing that association with theta has little direct effect on the chemistry occurring at the active site of epsilon. On the other hand, formation of the complex with theta stabilized epsilon 186 by approximately 14 degrees C against thermal inactivation. For epsilon 186, k(cat) = 293 min(-)(1) and K(M) = 1.08 mM at pH 8.00 and 25 degrees C, with a Mn(2+) concentration of 1 mM. Hydrolysis of pNP-TMP by epsilon 186 depended absolutely on divalent metal ions, and was inhibited by the product TMP. Dependencies on Mn(2+) and Mg(2+) concentrations were examined, giving a K(Mn) of 0.31 mM and a k(cat) of 334 min(-1) for Mn(2+) and a K(Mg) of 6.9 mM and a k(cat) of 19.9 min(-1) for Mg(2+). Inhibition by TMP was formally competitive [K(i) = 4.3 microM (with a Mn(2+) concentration of 1 mM)]. The pH dependence of pNP-TMP hydrolysis by epsilon 186, in the pH range of 6.5-9.0, was found to be simple. K(M) was essentially invariant between pH 6.5 and 8.5, while k(cat) depended on titration of a single group with a pK(a) of 7.7, approaching limiting values of 50 min(-1) at pH &lt;6.5 and 400 min(-1) at pH &gt;9.0. These data are used in conjunction with crystal structures of the complex of epsilon 186 with TMP and two Mn(II) ions bound at the active site to develop insights into the mechanisms of pNP-TMP hydrolysis by epsilon at high and low pH values.",M2
11919550,"Role of a novel soluble nucleotide phospho-hydrolase from sheep plasma in inhibition of platelet reactivity: hemostasis, thrombosis, and vascular biology.Ecto- and exoenzymes that metabolize extracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the major promoter of platelet activation and recruitment, are of potential clinical importance because they can metabolically prevent excessive thrombus growth. An ecto-ADPase (CD39, NTPDase1) has been identified on endothelial cells. We demonstrate that ADP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are rapidly metabolized to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in sheep plasma at pH 7.4. This hydrolysis is sensitive to P(1), P(5)-di-(adenosine-5') pentaphosphate (Ap(5)A), and ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) - N, N, N(-), N(-) tetra-acetate (EGTA) but insensitive to tetramisole (an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor). A specific phosphodiesterase substrate, p -nitrophenol-5'-thymidine monophosphate (<e>TMP</e>) (p -Nph-5'-TMP), was readily hydrolyzed in sheep plasma at a rate of approximately 0.25 nmol/min/mg protein, and this hydrolysis was inhibited by ADP, ATP, and Ap(5)A. Furthermore, 200-fold purified p -Nph-5'-TMP-hydrolyzing activity also hydrolyzed ATP and ADP directly to AMP. When ADP was preincubated in plasma, its ability to induce platelet aggregation was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. This effect was abolished by Ap(5)A. The inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation correlated with hydrolysis of the ADP in plasma. These data suggest that the endogenous soluble plasma phosphohydrolase metabolizes ATP and ADP by means of cleavage of the alpha-beta-phosphodiester bond of nucleoside 5'-phosphate derivatives. This novel biochemical activity inhibits platelet reactivity through hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides released by activated platelets during (patho)physiological processes, serving a homeostatic and antithrombotic function in vivo.",M2
11681703,"Titanium(IV) targets phosphoesters on nucleotides: implications for the mechanism of action of the anticancer drug titanocene dichloride.Abstract Reactions between the anticancer drug titanocene dichloride (Cp2TiCl2) and various nucleotides and their constituents in aqueous solution or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) have been investigated by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by IR spectroscopy. In aqueous solution over the pH* (pH meter reading in D2O) range 2.3-6.5, CMP forms one new species with Ti(IV) bound only to the phosphate group. In acidic media at pH*&lt;4.6, three species containing titanocene bound to the phosphate group of dGMP, AMP, dTMP and UMP are formed rapidly. The bases also appear to influence titanocene binding. Only one of these Ti(IV)-bound species can be detected in the pH* range of 4.6-6.5 in each case. The order of reactivity towards Cp2TiCl2(aq) at pH* ca. 3 is GMP&gt;<e>TMP</e> approximately AMP &gt; CMP. At pH* &gt; 7.0, hydrolysis of Cp2TiCl2 predominated and little reaction with the nucleotides was observed. Binding of deoxyribose 5'-phosphate and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate to Cp2TiCl2(aq) via their phosphate groups was detected by 31P NMR spectroscopy, but no reaction between Cp2TiCl2(aq) and deoxyguanosine, 9-ethylguanine or deoxy-D-ribose was observed in aqueous solution. The nucleoside phosphodiesters 3',5'-cyclic GMP and 2',3'-cyclic CMP did not react with Cp2TiCl2(aq) in aqueous solution; however, in the less polar solvent DMF, 3',5'-cyclic GMP coordination to [Cp2Ti]2+ via its phosphodiester group was readily observed. Binding of titanocene to the phosphodiester group of the dinucleotide GpC was also observed in DMF by 31P NMR. The nucleoside triphosphates ATP and GTP reacted more extensively with Cp2TiCl2(aq) than their monophosphates; complexes with bound phosphate groups were formed in acidic media and to a lesser extent at neutral pH. Cleavage of phosphate bonds in ATP (and GTP) by Cp2TiCl2(aq) to form inorganic phosphate, AMP (or GMP) and ADP (or GDP) was observed in aqueous solutions. In addition, titanocene binding to ATP was not inhibited by Mg(II), but the ternary complex titanocene-ATP-Mg appeared to form. These reactions contrast markedly with those of the drug cisplatin, which binds predominantly to the base nitrogen atoms of nucleotides and only weakly to the phosphate groups. The high affinity of Ti(IV) for phosphate groups may be important for its biological activity.",M2
11469859,"X-ray structure of <e>TMP</e> kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis complexed with TMP at 1.95 A resolution.The X-ray structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis TMP kinase at 1.95 A resolution is described as a binary complex with its natural substrate TMP. Its main features involve: (i) a clear magnesium-binding site; (ii) an alpha-helical conformation for the so-called LID region; and (iii) a high density of positive charges in the active site. There is a network of interactions involving highly conserved side-chains of the protein, the magnesium ion, a sulphate ion mimicking the beta phosphate group of ATP and the TMP molecule itself. All these interactions conspire in stabilizing what appears to be the closed form of the enzyme. A complete multialignment of all (32) known sequences of TMP kinases is presented. Subtle differences in the TMP binding site were noted, as compared to the Escherichia coli, yeast and human enzyme structures, which have been reported recently. These differences could be used to design specific inhibitors of this essential enzyme of nucleotide metabolism. Two cases of compensatory mutations were detected in the TMP binding site of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes. In addition, an intriguing high value of the electric field is reported in the vicinity of the phosphate group of TMP and the putative binding site of the gamma phosphate group of ATP.",M2
10993628,"Products from polycrystalline DNA constituents after X-irradiation and heavy-ion bombardment: formation of the 5,6-dihydroadduct in thymidine 5'-monophosphate and release of unaltered bases in nucleotides.PURPOSE: The major products from polycrystalline purine and pyrimidine DNA nucleotides after low- and high-LET irradiation were investigated quantitatively by HPLC and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Solid nucleotide samples were either X-irradiated as cylindrical pellets or heavy-ion bombarded (LET range of 100-12,500 keV/microm) as very thin tablets at 300K. Product analysis was performed by HPLC and 1H-NMR. RESULTS: For <e>TMP</e> the 5,6-dihydroadduct was found to be formed as product of electron reaction. In addition, all four DNA nucleotides showed a radiation-induced base release, which is probably connected with the oxidative radiation action. The formation of the products was linear with dose up to 300 kGy for X-irradiation or 200 kGy for heavy-ion bombardment. The estimation of the radiation chemical yields revealed G-values of about 10(-7) mol x J(-1) and were typically smaller for irradiation with charged particles than those for X-rays. After heavy-ion bombardment the G-values first increased with increasing LET and decreased for very heavy ions. CONCLUSIONS: The yields for base release from both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are comparable in magnitude. The 5,6-dihydroadduct from TMP is a major radiation induced product with larger yields than found for base release after X-irradiation and comparable yields after heavy-ion bombardment. The LET dependence of the G-values for base release in nucleotides is similar and resembles the double strand break formation in DNA. The observed similarity in the LET dependence of the G-values might derive from an inhomogeneous distribution of energy deposition resulting in 'clustered damage'.",M2
10873853,"Insights into the phosphoryltransfer mechanism of human thymidylate kinase gained from crystal structures of enzyme complexes along the reaction coordinate.BACKGROUND: Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that catalyzes the reversible phosphoryltransfer between ATP and <e>TMP</e> to yield ADP and TDP. In addition to its vital role in supplying precursors for DNA synthesis, human TMPK has an important medical role participating in the activation of a number of anti-HIV prodrugs. RESULTS: Crystal structures of human TMPK in complex with TMP and ADP, TMP and the ATP analog AppNHp, TMP with ADP and the phosphoryl analog AlF(3), TDP and ADP, and the bisubstrate analog TP(5)A were determined. The conformations of the P-loop, the LID region, and the adenine-binding loop vary according to the nature of the complex. Substitution of ADP by AppNHp results in partial closure of the P-loop and the rotation of the TMP phosphate group to a catalytically unfavorable position, which rotates back in the AlF(3) complex to a position suitable for in-line attack. In the fully closed state observed in the TP(5)A and the TDP-ADP complexes, Asp15 interacts strongly with the 3'-hydroxyl group of TMP. CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes of nucleotide state and conformation and the corresponding protein structural changes are correlated with intermediates occurring along the reaction coordinate and show the sequence of events occurring during phosphate transfer. The low catalytic activity of human TMPK appears to be determined by structural changes required to achieve catalytic competence and it is suggested that a mechanism might exist to accelerate the activity.",M2

The TMP was linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA) by carbodiimide reaction, and then modified with the OH. The neoantigens, TMP-BSA, and ROS-TMP-BSA conjugates induced highly specific antibodies against immunogens.

9416796,"Release of unaltered bases from polycrystalline pyrimidine DNA constituents after X-irradiation and bombardment with heavy ions.PURPOSE: The radiation-induced release of unaltered bases from the lyophilized pyrimidine DNA constituents <e>TMP</e>, dCMP, CMP and dCyd was determined quantitatively in order to study explicitly the direct radiation effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-irradiation under an air or a nitrogen gas atmosphere and heavy ion bombardment in the beam vacuum were employed at 300 K. The release of free bases was investigated using HPLC and 1H-NMR. Dose-yield curves for free radicals of X-irradiated TMP and dCMP samples were determined by EPR spectroscopy. RESULTS: As one of the main products, the release of unaltered bases is linear with dose up to 360 kGy for X-irradiation or 200 kGy for heavy ion bombardment. The estimation of the radiation chemical yields revealed G values of about 10(-7) mol J-1. The heavy ion bombardment and X-irradiation under nitrogen effected a lower yield for base release than that for X-irradiation under air. For X-irradiation at sufficiently high doses about one order of magnitude difference in yields between bases released and free radicals formed was found. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with related findings as described in the literature, the G values from DNA are in the same order of magnitude, but from nucleosides in frozen aqueous solutions the yields of free bases are several orders of magnitude smaller.",M2
9154142,"Secondary radical attack on DNA nucleotides: reaction by addition to DNA bases and abstraction from sugars.In this work radicals generated by dissociative electron attachment to iodoacetamide (H2NCOCH2.) and 6-chloromethyluracil (U5CH2.) are suggested to react with DNA nucleotides in frozen aqueous solutions via either hydrogen abstraction or addition to the double bonds of the bases. Methyl hydrogens of <e>TMP</e> are the preferential sites of the attack by H2NCOCH2. radical. For dCMP the C1' site on the sugar group is found to be the preferred site of hydrogen abstraction by H2NCOCH2. while for dGMP and to a lesser extent dAMP attack at the C8 position of the purine ring is found to be competitive with sugar attack. In general allylic U6CH2. and U5CH2. radicals are found to be poor hydrogen abstractors and the only reaction pathway found is the addition to double bonds at C6 in thymine and C8 in adenine and guanine. Whereas, the cytosine 5,6 double bond appears to be unreactive towards addition at low temperatures. Some evidence is found for sugar radical addition to the adenine C8 position.",M2
7594974,"Influence of electron scavengers on the radical formation in thymidine-5'-monophosphate and DNA in frozen aqueous solution and glasses.Structural and quantitative effects of different electron scavenger concentrations on the free radical formation in the nucleotide thymidine-5'-monophosphate (<e>TMP</e>) and in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after X-irradiation in frozen aqueous solution and glasses (BeF2/H2O for TMP and LiCl/H2O for DNA) at 77K are investigated. At the highest concentration used (100 mmol dm-3) about 80% (TMP) and 70% (DNA) of the radicals are scavenged compared with the control in both matrices. In TMP, allyl radicals form the major population of radicals left unscavenged at 77 K. These are shown to transform into a quintet pattern upon annealing (&gt; or = 220 K). Analysis of various substances for quintet formation shows that a sugar-group and a C4-carbonyl group are necessary structural prerequisites. For DNA three components can be extracted from spectra obtained with different scavenger concentration in frozen solutions. There are two components in LiCl glasses, which are comparable with two of the three in frozen aqueous solution. Their potential origin is discussed in comparison with nucleotide spectra.",M2
7751001,"Effect of lipopolysaccharide on thymidine salvage as related to macrophage activation.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known as one of the potent activators of macrophages, has inhibitory effects on the proliferation of normal macrophages and macrophage-like cell lines. We report here that LPS dose- and time-dependently suppressed the tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation into the acid-insoluble fraction with a significant inverse correlation to the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production in the J774.1 macrophage cell line. Among the three tested enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, only thymidine kinase (TK) activity decreased progressively in parallel with the decline in [3H]TdR incorporation, reaching 97% inhibition within 12 hr of LPS treatment, while changes in the activities of other two enzymes, DNA polymerase alpha and thymidylate synthase (TS), were less significant. On the other hand, LPS inhibited the cell proliferation only incompletely, as judged by 62% inhibition of cell growth at 36 hr. Even in the experiments done in a TdR-free medium, cell growth was inhibited by LPS to the same extent, suggesting that TK was not directly involved in the proliferation of J774 cells. LPS also inhibited the conversion of TdR to thymidine monophosphate (<e>TMP</e>) in murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM). Thus LPS-induced suppression of TdR salvage related to TNF production is common in both normal and neoplastic macrophages, and therefore may be of potential importance in the process of macrophage activation.",M2

The results show that water radicals in bulk ice do not lead to the formation of DNA or cysteamine radicals. Radicals from the oxidation pathway which include the DNA base one electron oxidized radicals and their successors, G(C8)OH., A(C8)OH. and thymine dimers (.Tdi) and/or T(C6)OH; readily react with cysteamine to form RS. and ultimately RSSR-. Reactions of dGMP and dCMP radicals from the oxidation pathway with cysteamine occur at lower temperatures than those of dAMP and TMP, suggesting hole migration. Both T(C6)H. and C(N3)H. react with cysteamine to form RS. and diamagnetic products, but G(C8)H. and A(C8)H. do not. Subtraction of the anion radical T-. and its proton adduct T(C6)H. from the total radical yield of TMP (with or without cysteamine) suggests that somewhat less than half of the total TMP radicals found are a result of the oxidative pathway. Similar results are found in the other nucleotides. The total spectral intensity derived from the radicals from the oxidative pathway such as G(C8)OH., A(C8)OH. and .Tdi/T(C6)OH. are somewhat less than that for the protonated anion radicals. Only one non-base radical is identified, a sugar radical at the C(1)' site on the deoxyribose portion of dAMP. This species, S(A)., is also found to react with cysteamine or its disulfide radical anion. Analyses performed in the presence and absence of a thiol are found to allow for a clear separation of oxidative and reductive pathways.",M2
8157589,"De novo synthesis of thymidylate via deoxycytidine in dcd (dCTP deaminase) mutants of Escherichia coli.dcd (dCTP deaminase) mutants of Escherichia coli were reported not to require thymidine for growth even though most of the thymidylate that is synthesized de novo arises from cytosine nucleotides through a pathway involving dCTP deaminase. We found, however, that the fresh introduction of dcd mutations into many strains of E. coli produced a requirement for thymidine for optimum aerobic growth, but the mutants readily reverted to prototrophy via mutations in other genes. One such mutation was in deoA, the gene for deoxyuridine phosphorylase. However, a dcd deo mutant became thymidine dependent once again if a cdd mutation (affecting deoxycytidine deaminase) were introduced. The results indicate that dcd mutants utilize an alternative pathway of <e>TMP</e> synthesis in which deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine are intermediates. A cdd mutation blocks the pathway by preventing the conversion of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine, whereas a deoA mutation enhances it by sparing deoxyuridine from catabolism. The deoxycytidine must arise from dCTP or dCDP via unknown steps. It is not known to what extent this pathway is utilized in wild-type cells, which, unlike the dcd mutants, do not accumulate dCTP.",M2
1517731,"Lanthanide ion luminescence as a probe of DNA structure. 2. Non- guanine-containing oligomers and nucleotides.Oligo(dC)8, oligo(dA)8, and oligo(dT)8 as well as d-CMP, d-AMP, and d-<e>TMP</e>, when complexed to Eu(3+), possess two classes of Eu(3+) binding environment. The binding environments consist of two classes, tight sites which coordinate two H2O molecules, and weaker sites which coordinate six or seven, analogous to the previously studied guanine-containing molecules. It is inferred that the tight class of Eu(3+) ion site observed with these oligomers and nucleotides corresponds to dimeric or polymeric structures. Comparison of the results for the guanine and non-guanine containing oligomers suggests that Eu(3+) possibly coordinates base nitrogen atoms in the former and in an outer sphere mode (hydrogen bonding via the H2O molecules coordinated to Eu(3+)) in the species examined here.",M2
1867645,"Thymidine and zidovudine metabolism in chronically zidovudine-exposed cells in vitro.Chronic exposure of H9 cells to 25 microM zidovudine (H9-AZT cells) causes a 2- to 3-fold increase in thymidine kinase (TK) activity (Agarwal RP, Int J Purines Pyrimidine Res, in press). The present study compared thymidine (TdR) and AZT anabolism in H9 and H9-AZT cells. After a 3.5-hr incubation with 10 microM TdR or AZT, the total intracellular accumulations of AZT (48.7 microM in H9 cells and 32.8 microM in H9-AZT cells) were 46.4% of TdR accumulation. Other major differences between TdR and AZT anabolism were: (i) the majority of TdR (84-87%) was incorporated into DNA compared to less than 1% of AZT; and (ii) whereas distribution of TdR in the nucleotides was TTP greater than <e>TMP</e> greater than TDP, zidovudine distributed was AZT-MP much greater than AZT-TP much greater than AZT-DP. Because of the poor substrate activity of AZT-MP for thymidylate kinase (TMP-kinase), most of the AZT (95-98%) remained as AZT-MP. TMP-kinase activities with TMP as substrate were 47.6 +/- 20.3 and 91.4 +/- 28.8 pmol/mg protein/min in H9 and H9-AZT cells, respectively. 5'-Nucleotidase activities with TMP as substrate were 428.9 +/- 37.8 and 255.9 +/- 28.7 pmol/mg protein/min in H9 and H9-AZT cells, respectively. Activities of these enzymes with AZT-MP as a substrate were very low. Despite an increase in TK and TMP-kinase, and a decrease in 5'-nucleotidase activities, the total intracellular accumulations of TdR and AZT were reduced significantly (P less than 0.05) to 67.5% in H9-AZT cells. Thymidine transport (0.66 to 0.68 pmol/sec/10(6) cells) was similar in both the cell lines. The severe reductions of TdR salvage caused by chronic exposure of cells to AZT, if it occurs in AIDS patients on AZT chemotherapy, may explain some of the long-term clinical toxicities of the drug.",M2
1900279,"Acquisition of thymidylate by the obligate intracytoplasmic bacterium Rickettsia prowazekii.The pathway for the acquisition of thymidylate in the obligate bacterial parasite Rickettsia prowazekii was determined. R. prowazekii growing in host cells with or without thymidine kinase failed to incorporate into its DNA the [3H]thymidine added to the culture. In the thymidine kinase-negative host cells, the label available to the rickettsiae in the host cell cytoplasm would have been thymidine, and in the thymidine kinase-positive host cells, it would have been both thymidine and <e>TMP</e>. Further support for the inability to utilize thymidine was the lack of thymidine kinase activity in extracts of R. prowazekii. However, [3H]uridine incorporation into the DNA of R. prowazekii was demonstrable (973 +/- 57 dpm/3 x 10(8) rickettsiae). This labeling of rickettsial DNA suggests the transport of uracil, uridine, uridine phosphates (UXP), or 2'-deoxyuridine phosphates, the conversion of the labeled precursor to thymidylate, and subsequent incorporation into DNA. This is supported by the demonstration of thymidylate synthase activity in extracts of R. prowazekii. The enzyme was determined to have a specific activity of 310 +/- 40 pmol/min/mg of protein and was inhibited greater than or equal to 70% by 5-fluoro-dUMP. The inability of R. prowazekii to utilize uracil was suggested by undetectable uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity and by its inability to grow (less than 10% of control) in a uridine-starved mutant cell line (Urd-A) supplemented with 50 microM to 1 mM uracil. In contrast, the rickettsiae were able to grow in Urd-A cells that were uridine starved and supplemented with 20 microM uridine (117% of control). However, no measurable uridine kinase activity could be measured in extracts of R. prowazekii. Normal rickettsial growth (92% of control) was observed when the host cell was blocked with thymidine so that the host cell's dUXP pool was depressed to a level inadequate for growth and DNA synthesis in the host cell. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that rickettsiae transport UXP from the host cell's cytoplasm and that they synthesize TTP from UXP.",M2
2105746,"Disruption of thymidylate synthesis and glycine-serine interconversion by L-methionine and L-homocystine in Raji cells.Excessive concentrations of L-methionine inhibited the folate-dependent de novo synthesis of thymidylic acid (<e>TMP</e>) in Raji cells, demonstrating the usefulness of this cell line for the study of methionine-folate antagonism. The effect was also produced by L-homocystine but not by other amino acids including D-methionine and L-ethionine, suggesting that this effect is exerted by a common intermediate of methionine and homocystine metabolism. L-Methionine, L-homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are not inhibitors of thymidylate synthase activity. On the other hand the capacity of the cells to incorporate serine 3-carbon and glycine 2-carbon into DNA is impaired by the presence of L-methionine or L-homocystine. Studies with cell-free extracts demonstrated that the glycine cleavage enzyme is inhibited by 45% by L-methionine, L-homocysteine, SAM or SAH. Serine hydroxymethylase on the other hand was slightly stimulated by these sulfur-containing compounds and this stimulation was shown to occur in the intact cell as well. These findings suggest that when levels of L-methionine metabolites are elevated, there is an increase in the use of glycine to maintain the intracellular concentration of serine, which is required for homocysteine detoxification by conversion to cystathionine. The reduction in TMP synthesis caused by excess L-methionine or L-homocystine may result from increased utilization of one-carbon units for serine synthesis.",M2
2559771,"Antibody-nucleic acid complexes. Oligo(dG)n and -(dT)n specificities associated with anti-DNA antibodies from autoimmune MRL mice.The specificity of anti-DNA antibodies in the sera of unimmunized autoimmune MRL mice was initially assessed via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibody binding profiles to a panel of immobilized antigens (AMP-, GMP-, CMP-, UMP-, and <e>TMP</e>-BSA, ss- and dsDNA) demonstrated high levels of immunoglobulins reacting with GMP and ssDNA and intermediate levels with AMP, TMP, and dsDNA. Fractionation of serum anti-DNA antibodies into subsets on the basis of their binding to GMP- and TMP-agarose indicated that the resulting GMP- or TMP-reactive antibodies bound to their homologous nucleotides and ssDNA. Competition-inhibition studies with soluble mono-, oligo-, and polynucleotides revealed that GMP- and TMP-reactive antibodies were highly specific for oligo(dG)n and -(dT)n sequences, respectively. Whereas the relative affinity of TMP-reactive autoantibodies to oligo(dT)n increased with oligonucleotide length (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15), GMP-reactive antibodies preferentially recognized oligo(dG)10 (Ka congruent to 1 x 10(7) M-1). While neither antibody recognized oligo(dA)8 and -(dC)8 competitors, mixed-base oligonucleotides were inhibitory at concentrations approximately 10-fold greater than similarly sized oligo(dG)n and -(dT)n sequences. Similar characterizations of both pooled and individual MRL sera indicated that anti-DNA antibodies represent 8-10% of the total serum IgG. More importantly, GMP-reactive autoantibodies predominated and accounted for 60-70% of the entire unbound anti-DNA antibody population.",M2
2558729,"Evidence for the formation of strand-break precursors in hydroxy-attacked thymidine 5'-monophosphate by the spin trapping method.A method combining spin trapping, ESR, and HPLC was employed to obtain evidence for the formation of sugar radicals in OH-attacked <e>TMP</e> with special emphasis on the detection of strand-break precursors of DNA. OH radicals were produced by irradiating an N2O-saturated aqueous solution with X-rays. When an N2O-saturated aqueous solution containing TMP and a spin trapping reagent, MNP, was irradiated with X-rays, it was estimated on the basis of theoretical calculations using rate constants that 94% of the TMP radicals were induced by OH radicals. Since several spin adducts between TMP radicals and MNP, as well as the byproducts of the spin trapping reagent itself, were produced, reverse-phase HPLC was used to separate them. The presence of six spin adducts was confirmed by ESR examination. Further examination of these spin adducts by UV absorbance spectrophotometry showed the presence of a chromophore at 260 nm in three adducts. Since a gradual increase in the release of unaltered base from these adducts was observed when they were allowed to stand for 0-22 h at room temperature, they could be regarded as the spin adducts of sugar radicals and MNP. ESR spectra from the spin adducts were consistent with hydrogen abstraction radicals at the C1', C4', and C5' positions of the sugar moiety. These radicals appeared to be precursors of AP sites and strand breaks. In addition to these spin adducts, ESR spectra that were consistent with the spin adducts of base radicals (the C5 and C6 radicals) and MNP were observed.",M2
2818620,"Evidence for acyloxymethyl esters of pyrimidine 5'-deoxyribonucleotides as extracellular sources of active 5'-deoxyribonucleotides in cultured cells.Cells commonly resist growth inhibition by purine and pyrimidine bases and nucleosides by restricting intracellular formation of the corresponding 5'-mononucleotides. Nucleotide derivatives that can act as effective membrane-transport precursors of the poorly membrane-permeable nucleotides have not been identified so far. We studied the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester (I) of FdUMP (5-fluoro-dUMP) and a cyclic phosphodiester (II) of FdUMP derived from 1,3-dihydroxyl-1-C-(pivaloyloxy-methyl)propane which are active in vivo against a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR)-resistant mouse leukemia and are attacked by carboxylic esterases under physiological conditions to produce FdUMP by elimination of formaldehyde and acrolein respectively. The assay for intracellular FdUMP was the inhibition of DNA synthesis due to inhibition of <e>TMP</e> synthetase in cultured mouse LM(TK-) fibroblasts genetically devoid of thymidine kinase (TK) and thus unable to convert FUdR directly to FdUMP. At 10(-6)M, I, II, or FUdR inhibited DNA synthesis in 2 hr by 99, 80, and 35% respectively; at 10(-5)M. maximal inhibition was attained after less than 15, 30 and 90 min respectively. Inhibition of DNA synthesis in TK+ cells by 10(-5) M I, II, or FUdR was reversed completely by 10(-5)M thymidine (TdR) but unaffected by 10(-5)M UdR, confirming TMP synthetase as the locus of inhibition. At 10(-5)M, bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) esters of phenyl phosphate or a p-substituted benzylphosphonic acid did not inhibit significantly DNA synthesis in TK+ cells. From this finding, and from effects produced by V (see below), we conclude that pivalic acid and CH2O arising from I contribute little to its above inhibitory effects. In TK- cells in which DNA synthesis is prevented by blockade of TMP synthetase with aminopterin, the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) ester (V) of TMP, at 0.9 x 10(-4) M, induced a 4-fold faster rate of DNA synthesis than did 10(-3)M TMP, whereas 10(-3) M TdR did not affect the rate. After 3 hr the rate with V was 80% that in the absence of aminopterin. In the above systems the nucleotide diesters I, II and V appear to be acting as effective extracellular sources of active intracellular FdUMP and TMP, in processes that involve loss of the two esterifying groups.",M2
2471526,"<e>TMP</e>-reactive autoantibodies in human SLE sera demonstrate thymine-dependent oligonucleotide specificity.Autoantibodies present in the sera of lupus patients and specific for single-stranded (ss) DNA were fractionated into subsets based upon their reactivity towards 5' nucleotide haptens. As evaluated by ELISA testing, antibodies retained by TMP-agarose bound to TMP-BSA and ssDNA but not to other nucleotide-BSA conjugates or to double-stranded (ds) DNA. Competition-inhibition studies further revealed that TMP-enriched oligo- and polynucleotides were the preferred antigens for these affinity purified antibodies. Similar assays with sequence- or size- defined oligonucleotides further implied that those oligonucleotides comprised entirely of TMP residues were most antigenic and that antigenicity increased with size (length). These results document the existence of a TMP-dependent oligonucleotide specificity among a diverse population of autoanti-ssDNA antibodies.",M2

2844253,"Probing the surface of Z-DNA with anti-nucleoside antibodies.Antibodies specific for cytidine (C) and guanosine (G) were used to probe the surface of two Z-DNA conformers. When tested by ELISA, anti-G reacted with poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) treated with bromine water [Br-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC)] but anti-C did not. A weak reaction with anti-C was detected by dot immunobinding. In contrast, anti-C reacted strongly with poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) treated with N-acetoxy-2-(acetylamino)fluorene [AAF-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC)]; anti-G reacted weakly, despite the fact that most G residues had not been substituted with AAF. Neither antinucleoside bound to the B conformation of poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC). In competition experiments, GMP was the most efficient competitor of the reaction of anti-G with Br-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC); AMP and <e>TMP</e> were 100-fold less efficient, and CMP did not compete to a significant extent. In contrast, the reaction of anti-Z with Br-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) was not inhibited by nucleotides. Of five possible sites recognized on guanosine by anti-G antibodies (N1, C6, O6, N7, and C8), AMP and TMP share three or their equivalent and CMP only one. The binding of anti-C to AAF-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) was inhibited best by CMP; AMP was 8 times less efficient; GMP and TMP were about 35-fold less efficient than CMP. Thus, although the amino group on the C4 position of CMP appears to be immunodominant, the capacity of GMP and TMP to inhibit the reaction indicates that other sites are also recognized in AAF-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), e.g., the exposed C5 position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
2824663,"Evidence that deletion of coding sequences in the 5' end of the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 affects the stability of the gene products.The experiments described in the present work were designed to study the function of the N-terminal end of thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1. Specifically we were interested to know whether this end was involved in binding of the enzyme to other molecules, had any influence on its subcellular localization or affected one or more of the activities associated with the enzyme. A parental enzyme and a deletion mutant, lacking the 45 N-terminal amino acids, derived from this strain, were used. Thymidine kinase from the parental virus bound to DNA-Sepharose, but the truncated enzyme did not. This was apparently not due to a specific ability to bind to DNA, since immunofluorescence studies indicated that both the normal and the deleted TK were mainly located in the cytoplasm, preferentially in the perinuclear region. Phosphorylation of thymidine as well as the amounts of TK polypeptides were markedly reduced at late times after infection with the mutant, but not to the same extent after infection with the wild-type. The deleted TK gene was efficiently transcribed as shown by hybridization of RNA to a probe specific for the gene, and this RNA directed the synthesis in vitro of TK polypeptides. Deletion of the 5' end of the gene seems to affect the stability of either the enzyme or TK-specific mRNA, or both. The <e>TMP</e> phosphorylating activity seems to be particularly destabilized relative to the thymidine phosphorylating activity.",M2
2821570,"Radiolysis of spin-labeled DNA: an electron spin resonance investigation.The reactions of free and DNA-bound 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-N-oxyl (PROXYL) probes with radicals generated during radiolysis of dilute aqueous solutions of DNA were examined. For the free PROXYL probe in deaerated solution with each of the four nucleotides (dAMP, dCMP, dGMP, and <e>TMP</e>) it was found that the pyrimidine radicals were more reactive toward the probe than were the purine radicals. Reactions of the electron adduct of TMP and the hydroxyl radical adducts of dAMP, dGMP, and TMP with the probe resulted in little or no reduction of the probe. For TMP these results are consistent with the fact that both the protonated electron and hydroxyl radical adducts of TMP will covalently bind to the nitroxide function of the probe. Reduction of the PROXYL probe was observed in reactions with the hydroxyl radical adduct of dCMP and with the electron adducts of dAMP, dCMP, and dGMP. Results of the radiolysis of the free PROXYL probe in deaerated dilute solution of DNA suggest that the PROXYL probe protects the DNA from water radical attack as the ratio of DNA bases to PROXYL probe increases above 50:1. Reactions of DNA-bound probes are dependent on the depth of the nitroxide function in relation to the major groove of the DNA helix. Two probes with tether lengths which are less than the depth of the major groove show an expected increase in reactions with DNA base radicals as compared to a probe with a tether that extends beyond the groove. The longer probe is involved largely in reactions with sugar and water radicals along the periphery of the DNA helix. In the presence of oxygen, there is a dramatic decrease in the loss of both the free and DNA-bound probes due to the lack of reaction of these probes with peroxyl radicals formed by the addition of molecular oxygen to DNA radicals.",M2
3477562,"Molecular evidence for cleavage of intradimer phosphodiester linkage as a novel step in excision repair of cyclobutyl pyrimidine photodimers in cultured human cells.A re-analysis of the metabolic fate of ultraviolet light (u.v.)-induced cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers in the DNA of dermal fibroblasts from patients with different genetic forms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare cancer-prone skin disorder, has provided new insight into the mode of dimer repair in normal human cells. When DNA isolated from post-u.v. incubated cultures was subjected to enzymic photoreactivation (PR) to probe dimer authenticity, single-strand scissions were produced in the damaged DNA of incubated XP group A and D cells, but not in DNA from XP group C cells or normal controls. Since enzymic PR treatment ruptures only the cyclobutane ring, these results suggested that in dimer excision-defective XP group A and D strains, the intradimer phosphodiester bond may have been cleaved without site restoration. Such a cleavage event had not previously been detected; the possibility that this reaction may be an early step in the normal excision-repair process is supported by the observed release of free thymidine (dThd) and its monophosphate (<e>TMP</e>), but not of thymine, upon photochemical reversal of the dimer-containing excision fragments isolated from post-u.v. incubated normal cells. The combined number of dThd and TMP molecules released was equal to approximately equal to 80% of the number of dimers photoreversed; for such release to occur, the dimer must both be at one end of an excised fragment and contain an internal phosphodiester break. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a novel model for dimer repair in human cells in which hydrolysis of the intradimer phosphodiester linkage precedes the concerted action of a generalized 'bulky lesion-repair complex' involving conventional strand incision/lesion excision/repair resynthesis/strand ligation reactions.",M2
3521740,"Photoreversal-dependent release of thymidine and thymidine monophosphate from pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA excision fragments isolated from ultraviolet-damaged human fibroblasts.To elucidate the enzymatic excision-repair process operative on cyclobutane-type pyrimidine photodimers in human dermal fibroblasts, we have examined excised dimer-containing material recovered in the trichloroacetic acid soluble fraction from far-ultraviolet-irradiated (254 nm, 40 J m-2) and incubated (24 h) cell cultures. The excised DNA photoproducts were found in oligonucleotide fragments with an estimated mean chain length of approximately 3.7 bases. Exposure of these isolated excision fragments, labeled with [3H]thymidine (dT), to a secondary, dimer-photoreversing fluence of far-UV (5.5 kJ m-2) resulted in the release of free dT and thymidine monophosphate (<e>TMP</e>). Photorelease of these two radioactive species was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, with TMP being detected as the increase in dT following bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment. These data imply that the photoliberated dT and TMP moieties were attached to the excision fragments solely by the cyclobutane ring of the dimer. No evidence was obtained for the photoliberation of free thymine, thus corroborating a conclusion reached by others that the excision of dimers in human cells is not initiated by scission of an intradimer N-glycosyl bond. The sum of the tritium label recovered in dT plus TMP corresponded to approximately 40% of that disappearing from thymine-containing dimers on photoreversal, suggesting that in about 80% of the isolated excision fragments the dimer is located at one end of the oligonucleotide and contains a break in its internal phosphodiester bond.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
3701790,"Zwitterionic 3'-O-acyl derivatives of thymidine 5'-phosphate as potential sources of intracellular thymidine 5'-phosphate in cells in culture.A convenient route is described for attachment of acyl groups CO(CH2)nN(Et)2(CH2)mNH(Et)2 (n = 3, m = 2; n = 4, m = 2-4), CO(CH2)nN(Et)2(CH2)mNEt3 (n = 4, m = 2-4), or CO(CH2)4N(CH2CH2)3N(CH2)nCH3 (n = 1 or 9) to O-3' of thymidine 5'-phosphate (<e>TMP</e>). The compounds are prototypes of 5'-nucleotide derivatives in which the two anionic charges could become partially masked in intramolecular anionic-cationic interactions and which might be able to diffuse into mammalian cells to furnish intracellular antimetabolite 5'-nucleotides by hydrolytic loss of a dicationic 3'-O-acyl group. At pH 7.6, 37 degrees C, hydrolyses of the 3'-ester linkages were pseudo first order with t1/2 values in the range 28-85 h. Paper chromatography in n-PrOH-H2O at pH 7.6 showed that type 1 or 2 derivatives were equally or slightly less hydrophobic than TMP (Rf 0.24), whereas the n-decyl type 3 compound (Rf 0.66) was markedly more hydrophobic, apparently because chain branching in group 3 is less than in 1 or 2. A sensitive and specific assay was developed for liberation of intracellular TMP in cultured mouse L fibroblasts in which synthesis of TMP and, hence, of DNA was suppressed by a combination of aminopterin and 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine (5'-NH2-dT). The TMP derivatives (100 microM) stimulated DNA synthesis, but omission of 5'-NH2-dT increased stimulation 6.5-fold, suggesting that stimulation occurred via degradation of the derivatives to dT. In confirmation, derivatives of type 2 (n = 4, m = 2 or 4) (100 microM) or type 3 (n = 9) (200 microM), in the presence of aminopterin, did not stimulate DNA synthesis in the LM(TK-) strain of L cells, which is genetically deficient in dT kinase. TMP (1 mM) stimulated DNA synthesis 2-3-fold and appeared to enter LM(TK-) cells without dephosphorylation, because dT (1 mM) gave no stimulation. If TMP is assumed to enter solely by passive diffusion, the inactivity of the TMP derivatives can be ascribed in part to their 2-fold higher molecular weight which can be expected to reduce flux through natural membranes ca. 16-fold.",M2
3155614,"Resistance of CCRF-CEM cloned sublines to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine associated with enhanced phosphatase activities.Resistance of human CCRF-CEM leukemic cells in tissue culture to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) has been examined following a single drug exposure (FS sublines). In two FS sublines generated by soft agar cloning of FdUrd sensitive cells in the presence of 10 nM FdUrd, the level of drug resistance was maintained at 22- to 30-fold following 1 month growth in the absence of FdUrd. Characteristic of the FS sublines was a decreased accumulation and retention of free intracellular 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) averaging 3% of FdUrd sensitive cells, a more rapid rate of disappearance of free FdUMP and FdUMP-bound thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase), and enhanced alkaline and acid phosphatase activities. There was no significant difference in the number of nucleoside transport sites per cell among the FS sublines and FdUrd-sensitive cells, indicating that the decreased accumulation of FdUMP in the resistant sublines was not the result of impaired FdUrd transport across the plasma membrane. The more rapid turnover of FdUMP-bound <e>TMP</e> synthase observed in the FS sublines was neither accompanied by a decreased stability of the TMP synthase-FdUMP-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ternary complex, nor an enhanced rate of degradation of FdUrd to the less potent agent, 5-fluorouracil. In addition, the growth rates of the two FS sublines were similar to that of FdUrd sensitive cells in medium containing hypoxanthine, methotrexate, and thymidine, indicating that there was no depletion of thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21, ATP : thymidine-5'-phosphotransferase) in the FS sublines. Therefore, we propose that enhanced activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, which influence the intracellular accumulation and retention of FdUMP, are important determinants of stable FdUrd resistance in CCRF-CEM cells.",M2

They were of interest as models for 5' nucleotide derivatives that might be able to permeate mammalian cells and then liberate intracellular antimetabolite 5' nucleotides by loss of the masking groups. Mouse L fibroblasts were grown in vitro in the presence of 1 mM 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine, which was found to suppress greater than 99% of cellular thymidine kinase activity while inhibiting the rate of cell division by only 30%. The TMP derivatives were less effective than thymidine in labeling the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the L cells. The labeling was inhibited 95-99% by 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine, indicating that it represented incorporation into DNA of [3H]thymidine formed from degradation of the test compounds. No evidence was obtained that the compounds acted as sources of intracellular TMP by cell permeation followed by loss of phosphate blocking groups. Similar studies yielded no evidence that the bis(m-nitrophenyl) ester of TMP produced intracellular TMP by that route in the LM(TK-) strain of L cells that are genetically deficient in thymidine kinase.",M2

6285465,"Transfer of radiation-induced spins from deoxyribonucleic and thymidylic acids to propyl gallate.When calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), propyl gallate (PG) and their five molecular mixtures (with PG content of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20%) are irradiated with gamma-rays in dry state in vacuum at 296 degrees K, the ESR spectra of all molecular mixtures differ strikingly from those of DNA, but bear a close resemblance to those of PG. The spin yield in the PG contained in these mixtures is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that in the case of PG irradiated separately. Furthermore, on the basis of the relative saturation characteristics of ESR spectra, these molecular mixtures behave more like PG than like DNA. It may be inferred that the radiation-induced spins could be transferred from DNA to PG. With r representing the molar ratio of nucleotides to PG, we have found a good linear correlation between the transfer ratio (TR) and square root of r. One PG molecule could protect at least 68 nucleotides in the duplex DNA chain, and thereby the minimal range of spin transfer is estimated at 115 A. Results obtained from irradiation at 77 degrees K show that PG exerts no protective effect on DNA, so DNA sustains an irreversible damage. It is thought that the spin transfer from DNA to PG is exclusively due to a hydrogen transfer mechanism. We have also demonstrated the transfer of radiation-induced spins from both thermally denatured DNA and <e>TMP</e> to PG. The former process can be ascribed primarily to the hydrogen transfer mechanism, whereas the latter, as in the case of native DNA, exclusively to this mechanism.",M2

218645,"Fluorescence studies of the interaction between 1,N6-ethenoadenosine monophosphate and nucleotides.AMP, GMP, <e>TMP</e> and CMP quench the fluorescence of 1,N6-ethenoadenosine monophosphate (epsilon-AMP). The fluorescence spectrum of epsilon-AMP-nucleotide system is identical with that of epsilon-AMP itself, and the fluorescence decay kinetics follow a single-exponential decay law. The dependence of fluorescence yields and lifetimes upon the concentration of nucleotides shows that the fluorescence of epsilon-AMP is principally quenched in a dynamic process by AMP, TMP and CMP, while it is quenched in both dynamic and static processes by GMP. The quenching constants increase in the following order: GMP greater than AMP greater than TMP greater than CMP.",M2
892290,"Effect of thymidine and thymidylate analogs on nucleic acid synthesis in tumor cells.Synthetic 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine (5'-AdThd), alpha,beta-methylenethymidine diphosphate (alpha,beta-MTDP), and alpha,beta-methylenethimidine triphosphate (alpha,beta-MTTP) were found to inhibit thymidine kinase. Using thymidine kinase extracted from FM 3A/B cells (a strain of mouse mammary gland tumor cells), the Ki values of 5'-AdThd, alpha,beta-MTDP, and alpha,beta-MTTP against thymidine were calculated to be 9.2 X 10(-5)M, 2.3 X 10(-5) M, and 1.8 X 10(-5) M, respectively. At concentrations above their Ki values alpha,beta-MTDP and alpha,beta-MTTP did not inhibit incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA of cultured cells, whereas 5'-AdThd did. Under the same conditions all three compounds inhibited <e>TMP</e> incorporation. The inhibitions of thymidine and TMP incorporation were specific, since the incorporation of deoxyguanosine was scarcely inhibired by 5'-AdThd. These results suggested that the specific inhibition of thymidine and TMP incorporation was mostly due to reduction in permeability of the cells to these substrates rather than to inhibition of thymidine kinase activity.",M2
787759,"A simple method for the isolation and characterization of thymidylate uptaking mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The mutant tmpl--10ts which confers thermosensitive auxotrophy for thymidylate is employed for the selection of 5'-dTMP uptaking mutants. At the nonpermissive temperature yeast cells phenotypically wild type for thymidylate uptake can grow for only 3 to 4 generations in the presence of 10(-2) M 5'-dTMP. Thymidylate utilizing mutants (tum mutants) were isolated which can grow in the presence of 12 to 24 mug 5'-dTMP/ml. Genetical analysis revealed one of these mutant strains to be a double mutant, tuml tum2. For normal growth haploid thymidylate auxotrophic strains require approximately 360 mug 5'-dTMP/ml when tuml and 24 mug 5'-dTMP when tum2 is present, respectively. Cells prototrophic for thymidylate (<e>TMP</e>) harbouring tuml tum2 will also take up 5'-dTMP and incorporate it specifically into their DNA. Thymidylate utilization in such strains is independent of functional mitochondria, as similar incorporation of labelled 5'-dTMP is found in isogenic strains with rho+, rho- and rho0 status. Optimal stimulation of the 5'-dTMP uptaking principle in haploid TMP strains is found at 4 mug5'-dTMP/ml when tuml and tum2 are present.",M2
8893,"Isolation and properties of yeast mutants with highly efficient thymidylate utilization.A screening procedure is presented which allows the isolation of yeast mutants (typ tir) with highly efficient utilization of exogenous deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dTMP) (greater than 50%). Data are given concerning the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP utilization in general: (i) The ability of S. cerevisiae to incorporate exogenous 5'-dTMP was found to already to be a wild type feature of this yeast, i.e. apparently not to be due to any mutation such as typ, tup, <e>tmp</e>, per or tum. Consequently these mutations are interpreted as amplifiers of a pre-given wild type potency. So far eight stages of 5'-dTMP utilization were detected as classified by the optimal 5'-dTMP requirement, with 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked, of the corresponding mutant strains isolated. All of them fit well into a mathematical series of the type  2n x 1.5  (n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 11), where the product term for n = 11 represents the 5'-dTMP requirement (mug/ml) of the best 5'-dTMP utilizing wild type strain found. (ii) Amplification of the 5'-dTMP utilizing potency obviously is due to any genetically determined alteration of the yeast 5'-dTMP uptaking principle itself or of physiological processes accompanying the monophosphate's uptake. (iii) The functioning of 5'-dTMP uptake requires acidic (less than or equal to pH 6) conditions in the yeast cell's outer environment. (iv) Some yeast typ and typ tlr mutants were found to exhibit a more or less pronounced sensitivity towards exogenously offered 5'-dTMP. The response of a sensitive strain towards inhibitory concentrations of the nucleotide apparently is co-conditioned by the presence or absence of thymidylate biosynthesis. With 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked the 5'-dTMP mediated inhibition is a permanent one and finally leads to the death of a cell. With a functioning thymidylate biosynthesis, in contrast, the inhibition is only temporary. (v) Yeast typ or typ tlr strains were observed to dephosphorylate exogenous 5'-dTMP to thymidine due to a phosphatase activity which cannot be eliminated at pH 7 + 70 mM inorganic phosphate conditions in the growth medium. This 5'-dTMP cleavage obviously occurs outside the cell and does not seem to be correlated both to the monophosphate's uptake and to the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP sensitivity. The destruction of 5'-dTMP does not disturb (5'-dTMP) DNA-specific labelling.",M2
