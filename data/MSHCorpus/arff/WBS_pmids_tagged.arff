20403157,"Essential role of the N-terminal region of TFII-I in viability and behavior.BACKGROUND: GTF2I codes for a general intrinsic transcription factor and calcium channel regulator TFII-I, with high and ubiquitous expression, and a strong candidate for involvement in the morphological and neuro-developmental anomalies of the Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). WBS is a genetic disorder due to a recurring deletion of about 1,55-1,83 Mb containing 25-28 genes in chromosome band 7q11.23 including GTF2I. Completed homozygous loss of either the Gtf2i or Gtf2ird1 function in mice provided additional evidence for the involvement of both genes in the craniofacial and cognitive phenotype. Unfortunately nothing is now about the behavioral characterization of heterozygous mice. METHODS: By gene targeting we have generated a mutant mice with a deletion of the first 140 amino-acids of TFII-I. mRNA and protein expression analysis were used to document the effect of the study deletion. We performed behavioral characterization of heterozygous mutant mice to document in vivo implications of TFII-I in the cognitive profile of WBS patients. RESULTS: Homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice exhibit craniofacial alterations, most clearly represented in homozygous condition. Behavioral test demonstrate that heterozygous mutant mice exhibit some neurobehavioral alterations and hyperacusis or odynacusis that could be associated with specific features of WBS phenotype. Homozygous mutant mice present highly compromised embryonic viability and fertility. Regarding cellular model, we documented a retarded growth in heterozygous MEFs respect to homozygous or wild-type MEFs. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that, although additive effects of haploinsufficiency at several genes may contribute to the full craniofacial or neurocognitive features of WBS, correct expression of GTF2I is one of the main players. In addition, these findings show that the deletion of the fist 140 amino-acids of TFII-I altered it correct function leading to a clear phenotype, at both levels, at the cellular model and at the in vivo model.",M1
20186780,"Pulmonary function and emphysema in Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is caused by a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 7q11.23 that encompasses the entire elastin (ELN) gene. Elastin, a key component of elastic fibers within the lung, is progressively destroyed in emphysema. Defects in the elastin gene have been associated with increased susceptibility towards developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema in both humans and mice. We postulate that hemizygosity at the elastin gene locus may increase susceptibility towards the development of COPD and emphysema in subjects with WBS. We describe an adult subject with WBS who was a lifelong non-smoker and was found to have moderate emphysema. We also examined the pulmonary function of a separate cohort of adolescents and young adults with WBS. Although no significant spirometric abnormalities were identified, a significant proportion of subjects reported respiratory symptoms. Thus, while significant obstructive disease does not appear to be common in relatively young adults with WBS, subclinical emphysema and lung disease may exist which possibly could worsen with advancing age. Further investigation may elucidate the pathogenesis of non-smoking-related emphysema.",M1
20146355,"Zebrafish gene knockdowns imply roles for human YWHAG in infantile spasms and cardiomegaly.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with an elfin-like face, supravalvular aortic stenosis, a specific cognitive-behavioral profile, and infantile hypercalcemia. We encountered two WBS patients presenting with infantile spasms, which is extremely rare in WBS. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed atypical 5.7-Mb and 4.1-Mb deletions at 7q11.23 in the two patients, including the WBS critical region and expanding into the proximal side and the telomeric side, respectively. On the proximal side, AUTS2 and CALN1 may contribute to the phenotype. On the telomeric side, there are two candidate genes HIP1 and YWHAG. Because detailed information of them was unavailable, we investigated their functions using gene knockdowns of zebrafish. When zebrafish ywhag1 was knocked down, reduced brain size and increased diameter of the heart tube were observed, indicating that the infantile spasms and cardiomegaly seen in the patient with the telomeric deletion may be derived from haploinsufficiency of YWHAG.",M1
20007321,"Negative autoregulation of GTF2IRD1 in Williams-Beuren syndrome via a novel DNA binding mechanism.The GTF2IRD1 gene is of principal interest to the study of Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). This neurodevelopmental disorder results from the hemizygous deletion of a region of chromosome 7q11.23 containing 28 genes including GTF2IRD1. WBS is thought to be caused by haploinsufficiency of certain dosage-sensitive genes within the deleted region, and the feature of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) has been attributed to reduced elastin caused by deletion of ELN. Human genetic mapping data have implicated two related genes GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I in the cause of some the key features of WBS, including craniofacial dysmorphology, hypersociability, and visuospatial deficits. Mice with mutations of the Gtf2ird1 allele show evidence of craniofacial abnormalities and behavioral changes. Here we show the existence of a negative autoregulatory mechanism that controls the level of GTF2IRD1 transcription via direct binding of the GTF2IRD1 protein to a highly conserved region of the GTF2IRD1 promoter containing an array of three binding sites. The affinity for this protein-DNA interaction is critically dependent upon multiple interactions between separate domains of the protein and at least two of the DNA binding sites. This autoregulatory mechanism leads to dosage compensation of GTF2IRD1 transcription in WBS patients. The GTF2IRD1 promoter represents the first established in vivo gene target of the GTF2IRD1 protein, and we use it to model its DNA interaction capabilities.",M1
19880526,"Williams-Beuren syndrome-associated transcription factor TFII-I regulates osteogenic marker genes.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is characterized by a unique cognitive profile and craniofacial defects. WBS results from a microdeletion at the chromosomal location 7q11.23 that encompasses the genes encoding the members of TFII-I family of transcription factors. Given that the haploinsufficiency for TFII-I is causative to the craniofacial phenotype in humans, we set out to analyze the effect of post-transcriptional silencing of TFII-I during BMP-2-driven osteoblast differentiation in the C2C12 cell line. Our results show that TFII-I plays an inhibitory role in regulating genes that are essential in osteogenesis and intersects with the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2 and the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. Identification of pathways regulated by TFII-I family transcription factors may begin to shed light on the molecular determinants of WBS.",M1
19815602,"Clinical features and management of arterial hypertension in children with Williams-Beuren syndrome.BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common finding in children with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). METHODS: The aim of this retrospective study was to review the clinical presentation of systemic hypertension in WBS children, its origin and management. We included 41 children with confirmed WBS who were referred to the paediatric nephrology or cardiology unit for hypertension. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of hypertension was 4.7 years. Out of 41, 24 patients had systolic blood pressure (BP) between +10 and +30 mmHg above the 95th percentile (1.645 SD), and 20/41 patients had diastolic BP between the 95th percentile (1.645 SD) and &gt;10 mmHg. Thirty-nine patients were asymptomatic. Arteriography, performed in 17/41 patients, revealed a renal artery stenosis (RAS) in 10 patients (58%). Echocardiography was performed in all patients and showed isthmic coarctation in four patients (9%). Calcium channel blockers were used in half of the patients (22/41) and seemed to control hypertension in most cases. Interventional treatment of RAS was performed in five patients (three angioplasty and two surgical bypass). It controlled hypertension in one patient but remained ineffective in the four others. CONCLUSIONS: Medical treatment essentially calcium blockers improved hypertension in most cases. Interventional treatment of RAS has not been encouraging.",M1
19629319,"Speech fluency profile in Williams-Beuren syndrome: a preliminary study.BACKGROUND: the speech fluency pattern attributed to individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is supported by the effectiveness of the phonological loop. Some studies have reported the occurrence of speech disruptions caused by lexical and semantic deficits. However, the type and frequency of such speech disruptions has not been well elucidated. AIM: to determine the speech fluency profile of individuals with WBS and to compare the speech performance of these individuals to a control group matched by gender and mental age. METHOD: Twelve subjects with Williams-Beuren syndrome, chronologically aged between 6.6 and 23.6 years and mental age ranging from 4.8 to 14.3 years, were evaluated. They were compared with another group consisting of 12 subjects with similar mental age and with no speech or learning difficulties. Speech fluency parameters were assessed according to the ABFW Language Test: type and frequency of speech disruptions and speech rate. The obtained results were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In comparison with individuals of similar mental age and typical speech and language development, the group with Williams-Beuren syndrome showed a greater percentage of speech discontinuity, and an increased frequency of common hesitations and word repetition. CONCLUSION: The speech fluency profile presented by individuals with WBS in this study suggests that the presence of disfluencies can be caused by deficits in the lexical, semantic, and syntactic processing of verbal information. The authors stress that further systematic investigations on the subject are warranted.",M1
19568270,"An atypical 7q11.23 deletion in a normal IQ Williams-Beuren syndrome patient.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>; OMIM no. 194050) is a multisystemic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a hemizygous deletion of 1.55 Mb on chromosome 7q11.23 spanning 28 genes. Haploinsufficiency of the ELN gene was shown to be responsible for supravalvular aortic stenosis and generalized arteriopathy, whereas LIMK1, CLIP2, GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I genes were suggested to be linked to the specific cognitive profile and craniofacial features. These insights for genotype-phenotype correlations came from the molecular and clinical analysis of patients with atypical deletions and mice models. Here we report a patient showing mild WBS physical phenotype and normal IQ, who carries a shorter 1 Mb atypical deletion. This rearrangement does not include the GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I genes and only partially the BAZ1B gene. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that hemizygosity of the GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I genes might be involved in the facial dysmorphisms and in the specific motor and cognitive deficits observed in WBS patients.",M1
19109438,"Essential functions of the Williams-Beuren syndrome-associated TFII-I genes in embryonic development.GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 encoding the multifunctional transcription factors TFII-I and BEN are clustered at the 7q11.23 region hemizygously deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), a complex multisystemic neurodevelopmental disorder. Although the biochemical properties of TFII-I family transcription factors have been studied in depth, little is known about the specialized contributions of these factors in pathways required for proper embryonic development. Here, we show that homozygous loss of either Gtf2ird1 or Gtf2i function results in multiple phenotypic manifestations, including embryonic lethality; brain hemorrhage; and vasculogenic, craniofacial, and neural tube defects in mice. Further analyses suggest that embryonic lethality may be attributable to defects in yolk sac vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Microarray data indicate that the Gtf2ird1 homozygous phenotype is mainly caused by an impairment of the genes involved in the TGFbetaRII/Alk1/Smad5 signal transduction pathway. The effect of Gtf2i inactivation on this pathway is less prominent, but downregulation of the endothelial growth factor receptor-2 gene, resulting in the deterioration of vascular signaling, most likely exacerbates the severity of the Gtf2i mutant phenotype. A subset of Gtf2ird1 and Gtf2i heterozygotes displayed microcephaly, retarded growth, and skeletal and craniofacial defects, therefore showing that haploinsufficiency of TFII-I proteins causes various developmental anomalies that are often associated with WBS.",M1
19097873,"[Williams-Beuren syndrome: a multidisciplinary approach]Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) (OMIM# 194050) is a rare, most often sporadic, genetic disease caused by a chromosomal microdeletion at locus 7q11.23 involving 28 genes. Among these, the elastin gene codes for the essential component of the arterial extracellular matrix. Developmental disorders usually associate an atypical face, cardiovascular malformations (most often supravalvular aortic stenosis and/or pulmonary artery stenosis) and a unique neuropsychological profile. This profile is defined by moderate mental retardation, relatively well-preserved language skills, visuospatial deficits and hypersociability. Other less known or rarer features, such as neonatal hypercalcemia, nutrition problems in infancy, ophthalmological anomalies, hypothyroidism, growth retardation, joint disturbances, dental anomalies and hypertension arising in adolescence or adulthood, should be treated. The aim of this paper is to summarize the major points of WBS regarding: (i) the different genes involved in the deletion and their function, especially the elastin gene and recent reports of rare forms of partial WBS or of an opposite syndrome stemming from a microduplication of the 7q11.23 locus, (ii) the clinical features in children and adults with a focus on cardiovascular injury, and (iii) the specific neuropsychological profile of people with WBS through its characteristics, the brain structures involved, and learning.",M1
18824871,"Thyroid hypoplasia as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism in Williams syndrome.In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life.",M1
18793597,"Periodontal conditions in Williams Beuren syndrome: a series of 8 cases.BACKGROUND: Williams Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is an unusual hereditary connective tissue disease caused by a microdeletion at position 7q11-23 and a haploinsufficiency at the elastin gene. The most frequent specific features are elf-like face, alteration of cognitive functions and cardiovascular diseases including isolated supravalvular aortic stenosis. A number of clinical findings have been reported, but none of the studies evaluating this syndrome consider the oral cavity. It is equally surprising that the gingival tissue, which carries a perfectly structured elastic fibre network, has not yet been investigated. It is important to verify whether subjects affected by WBS are more susceptible to periodontal disease than healthy subjects who are not that much affected, for periodontal disease may have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. METHODS: In an attempt to address this issue, the oral manifestations of 8 patients (ages from 5 to 12 years) with WBS have been investigated: dental examination, periodontal examination (gingival phenotype, plaque control record, gingival index, bone quality). RESULTS: All patients had oral parafunction, tooth number abnormalities and malocclusions. Average gingival height and width were greater than normal. Plaque index was always very high except for one patient, but the gingival inflammation was not linked to the quantity of clinical plaque index. There was no obvious loss of attachment. CONCLUSION: As with collagen, elastin is a structural macromolecule of the gingiva. These components play an important role in gingival function and in the resistance of the periodontium to daily aggressions. Unlike genetic diseases characterized by impairment of collagen macrofibrils, it is suggested that the hemizygous gene encoding elastin does not result in periodontal disease. In addition there is an existence of a possible concordance between the elastin gene haploinsufficiency and the periodontal phenotype. There might be some adaptive process to this deficiency.",M1
18553513,"The common inversion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome region at 7q11.23 does not cause clinical symptoms.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is caused by a approximately 1.5 million base pair deletion at 7q11.23. A common inversion of the region, WBSinv-1, exists as a polymorphism but was also found in individuals with WBS-like features but no deletion, suggesting it could cause clinical symptoms. We performed a full clinical, developmental and genetic assessment of two previously reported individuals with clinical symptoms and WBSinv-1 but no 7q11.23 deletion. We also examined expression of genes at 7q11.23 in individuals in the general population who have WBSinv-1. We show that individuals with clinical symptoms and WBSinv-1 do not show significant clinical or psychological overlap with individuals with WBS. In addition, a 1.3 Mb duplication of part of the velocardiofacial syndrome region on chromosome 22q11.2 was found in one participant with WBSinv-1 and clinical symptoms. We also demonstrate that individuals with WBSinv-1 show normal expression of genes from the WBS region. These results suggest that WBSinv-1 does not cause clinical symptoms and we advise caution when diagnosing individuals with atypical presentation of rare syndromes. Whole genome analysis may reveal previously unidentified copy number variants that could contribute to syndromic features.",M1
18452001,"Mechanisms and treatment of cardiovascular disease in Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a microdeletion disorder caused by heterozygous loss of approximately 1.5-Mb pairs of DNA from chromosome 7. Patients with WBS have a characteristic constellation of medical and cognitive findings, with a hallmark feature of generalized arteriopathy presenting as stenoses of elastic arteries and hypertension. Human and mouse studies establish that defects in the elastin gene, leading to elastin haploinsufficiency, underlie the arteriopathy. In this review we describe potential links between elastin expression and arteriopathy, possible explanations for disease variability, and current treatment options and their limitations, and we propose several new directions for the development of nonsurgical preventative therapies based on insights from elastin biology.",M1
18398435,"Williams-Beuren syndrome TRIM50 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurodevelopmental and multisystemic disease that results from hemizygosity of approximately 25 genes mapping to chromosomal region 7q11.23. We report here the preliminary description of eight novel genes mapping within the WBS critical region and/or its syntenic mouse region. Three of these genes, TRIM50, TRIM73 and TRIM74, belong to the TRIpartite motif gene family, members of which were shown to be associated to several human genetic diseases. We describe the preliminary functional characterization of these genes and show that Trim50 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, opening the interesting hypothesis that the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway might be involved in the WBS phenotype.",M1
18292220,"Copy number variation at the 7q11.23 segmental duplications is a susceptibility factor for the Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion.Large copy number variants (CNVs) have been recently found as structural polymorphisms of the human genome of still unknown biological significance. CNVs are significantly enriched in regions with segmental duplications or low-copy repeats (LCRs). Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11.23 mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between large flanking LCRs and facilitated by a structural variant of the region, a approximately 2-Mb paracentric inversion present in 20%-25% of WBS-transmitting progenitors. We now report that eight out of 180 (4.44%) WBS-transmitting progenitors are carriers of a CNV, displaying a chromosome with large deletion of LCRs. The prevalence of this CNV among control individuals and non-transmitting progenitors is much lower (1%, n=600), thus indicating that it is a predisposing factor for the WBS deletion (odds ratio 4.6-fold, P= 0.002). LCR duplications were found in 2.22% of WBS-transmitting progenitors but also in 1.16% of controls, which implies a non-statistically significant increase in WBS-transmitting progenitors. We have characterized the organization and breakpoints of these CNVs, encompassing approximately 100-300 kb of genomic DNA and containing several pseudogenes but no functional genes. Additional structural variants of the region have also been defined, all generated by NAHR between different blocks of segmental duplications. Our data further illustrate the highly dynamic structure of regions rich in segmental duplications, such as the WBS locus, and indicate that large CNVs can act as susceptibility alleles for disease-associated genomic rearrangements in the progeny.",M1
18037993,"Visual phenotype in Williams-Beuren syndrome challenges magnocellular theories explaining human neurodevelopmental visual cortical disorders.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder whose manifestations include visuospatial impairment, provides a unique model to link genetically determined loss of neural cell populations at different levels of the nervous system with neural circuits and visual behavior. Given that several of the genes deleted in WBS are also involved in eye development and the differentiation of retinal layers, we examined the retinal phenotype in WBS patients and its functional relation to global motion perception. We discovered a low-level visual phenotype characterized by decreased retinal thickness, abnormal optic disk concavity, and impaired visual responses in WBS patients compared with age-matched controls by using electrophysiology, confocal and coherence in vivo imaging with cellular resolution, and psychophysics. These mechanisms of impairment are related to the magnocellular pathway, which is involved in the detection of temporal changes in the visual scene. Low-level magnocellular performance did not predict high-level deficits in the integration of motion and 3D information at higher levels, thereby demonstrating independent mechanisms of dysfunction in WBS that will require remediation strategies different from those used in other visuospatial disorders. These findings challenge neurodevelopmental theories that explain cortical deficits based on low-level magnocellular impairment, such as regarding dyslexia.",M1
17853466,"Studies of age-correlated features of cognitive-behavioral development in children and adolescents with genetic disorders.Studies of age-related features of cognitive-behavioral deficits produced by genetic mutations permit us to draw inferences about how brain development may be related cognitive ability as the child ages. Except for Down syndrome (DS) and the fragile X mutation (FRAXA), little is known about the longitudinal changes in cognitive-behavioral development in individuals with genetic abnormalities producing learning disabilities (LD) or mental retardation (MR). The purpose of this prospective study was to compare and contrast age related to cognitive abilities, adaptive and maladaptive behaviors in children and adolescents in the same age range, diagnosed with one of three genetic disorders: the FRAXA mutation, Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). We also sought to examine whether cognitive-behavioral abilities associated with these three genetic disorders were related systematically to age. We examined 108 children, ages 4-15 years, with FRAXA, WBS, or NF1. Results show that there is a significant negative correlation between age and IQ, and between age and adaptive behavior (DQ) scores, in children with FRAXA and WBS, but not in children with NF1. All three groups of children have unusually high proportions of maladaptive behavior, ranging from 1/6 children with NF1 to 2/3 children with FRAXA. Cognitive and adaptive behavior profiles of children with FRAXA and WBS were also surprisingly similar. Our findings suggest the need for examining longitudinal developmental cognitive-behavioral changes in children and adolescents with all genetic disorders that produce LD or MR.",M1

17639596,"Diagnosis and management of medical problems in adults with Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities.",M1
17565757,"Rearrangements of the Williams-Beuren syndrome locus: molecular basis and implications for speech and language development.The Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) locus on human chromosome 7q11.23 is flanked by complex chromosome-specific low-copy repeats that mediate recurrent genomic rearrangements of the region. Common genomic rearrangements arise through unequal meiotic recombination and result in complex but distinct behavioural and cognitive phenotypes. Deletion of 7q11.23 results in WBS, which is characterised by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning difficulties, with relative cognitive strengths in verbal short-term memory and in language and extreme weakness in visuospatial construction, as well as anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and overfriendliness. By contrast, duplication results in severely delayed speech and expressive language, with relative strength in visuospatial construction. Although deletion and duplication of the WBS region have very different effects, both cause forms of language impairment and suggest that dosage-sensitive genes within the region are important for the proper development of human speech and language. The spectrum and frequency of genomic rearrangements at 7q11.23 presents an exceptional opportunity to identify gene(s) directly involved in human speech and language development.",M1
17537022,"Outcome of pulmonary and aortic stenosis in Williams-Beuren syndrome in an Asian cohort.AIMS: To define the cardiovascular anomalies and the long-term outcomes in an Asian cohort with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). METHODS: Data were retrieved from a retrospective chart review of patients who had a definitive diagnosis of WBS by fluorescence in situ hybridization between 1995 and 2005. All patients underwent echocardiography every 3-9 months. Ten patients underwent cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with a total follow-up of 134 patient-years (median: 72 months) were enrolled. Characteristic dysmorphic facial features were noted in 19 patients (n = 19, 90%). All except one had associated cardiac anomalies, accounting for 0.3% (20/6640) of the patients with congenital heart disease. The spectrum of cardiac anomalies included supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) (n = 15, 71%), peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) (n = 12, 57%), pulmonary valve stenosis (PS) (n = 10, 47%), mitral valve prolapse (MVP) (n = 9, 43%), coarcation of the aorta (n = 4, 19%), ventricular septal defect (n = 2, 10%) and atrial septal defect (n = 1, 5%). Concurrent SVAS and PS/PPS were found in 14 (70%) patients. Only one patient required balloon dilation of PS, which improved. Regression of the stenoses occurred with a probability of 31, 90 and 71% at the age of 10 years for SAVS, PS and PPS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among our WBS patients, SVAS, PPS and PS were common, and were associated with probability of spontaneous regression, especially of right-sided lesions.",M1
17180802,"[Genetics and language in Williams-Beuren Syndrome: a distinct neurobehavioral disorder]BACKGROUND: genetic, cognitive and language aspects of the Williams-Beuren Syndorme (<e>WBS</e>). AIM: to present a review of the literature about WBS, highlighting its genetic, cognitive and language characteristics. CONCLUSION: the literature indicates that although the etiology of WBS is known, early diagnosis is difficult due to the great variability of its clinical characteristics. This great phenotypic variability has been associated to a deletion of several genes in region 7q 11.23 which includes the elastin gene. The deletion of this gene is identified by the Fluorecent in situ Hibridization test (FISH). The incidence of this syndrome is 1 in every 20,000 birth and is the result of a  de novo  genetic alteration. The syndrome is characterized by an elfin type face, cardiac alterations, cognitive deficits and behavioral aspects that include language. A peculiar cognitive profile has often been described as consisting of outstanding social and verbal skills associated to visuo-spatial impairments. Cognitive deficits are variable and may not be present. Studies that describe language abilities indicate that syntax might be intact or partially intact; speech can be precise and intelligible indicating that the phonological system is preserved. The receptive vocabulary is mentioned in a few studies as being adequate and in others as being impaired according to mental age. Researches have produced incongruent findings regarding the cognitive and linguistic abilities. The correlation between the language and cognitive abilities and the divergent findings presented in the literature will be discussed in this article.",M1
17016608,"Williams-Beuren syndrome: determination of deletion size using quantitative real-time PCR.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a rare genetic disorder (1/20,000-50,000) and is usually caused by a 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23. At least 25 genes have been identified in the deletion region in WBS patients, which is flanked by large low-copy-repeat sequences (&gt; 320 kb). By using FISH as well as microsatellite analysis, it is not possible to get a precise identification of the size of the deletion. For determining the deletion size, we developed a reliable quantitative PCR approach. Our assay screens 2.5 Mb of the WBS region in 100- to 300-kb intervals. This methodology has been tested in DNA samples of 65 patients with the clinical suspicion of WBS. In every case we were able to exclude or to identify the presence of a deletion and to determine its size. Deletion size varied from 0.2 Mb to 2.5 Mb. The 2.5-Mb rearrangement represents the largest deletion described at present and it was detected in a severely affected patient.

In this study we investigated how WBS subjects search and scan their visual environment. We presented 10 search displays on a computer screen to WBS subjects as well as control subjects, with the instruction to find a target out of several stimulus elements. We analyzed the eye movement patterns for fixation characteristics and systematicy of search. Fixations generally lasted longer in WBS subjects than in control subjects. WBS subjects made more fixations at a stimulus element they had already looked at and more fixations that were not aimed at a stimulus element at all, decreasing the efficiency of search. These outcomes lead to the conclusion that visual search of individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome is less effective than in control subjects. This finding may be related to their motor deficits, an impaired processing of global visual information and/or deficits in working memory and could reflect impairments within the dorsal stream.",M1
16971481,"An atypical deletion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome interval implicates genes associated with defective visuospatial processing and autism.BACKGROUND: During a genetic study of autism, a female child who met diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder, but also exhibited the cognitive-behavioural profile (CBP) associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) was examined. The WBS CBP includes impaired visuospatial ability, an overly friendly personality, excessive non-social anxiety and language delay. METHODS: Using array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH), a deletion corresponding to BAC RP11-89A20 in the distal end of the WBS deletion interval was detected. Hemizygosity was confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridisation and fine mapping was performed by measuring the copy number of genomic DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proximal breakpoint was mapped to intron 1 of GTF2IRD1 and the distal breakpoint lies 2.4-3.1 Mb towards the telomere. The subject was completely hemizygous for GTF2I, commonly deleted in carriers of the classic approximately 1.5 Mb WBS deletion, and GTF2IRD2, deleted in carriers of the rare approximately 1.84 Mb WBS deletion. CONCLUSION: Hemizygosity of the GTF2 family of transcription factors is sufficient to produce many aspects of the WBS CBP, and particularly implicate the GTF2 transcription factors in the visuospatial construction deficit. Symptoms of autism in this case may be due to deletion of additional genes outside the typical WBS interval or remote effects on gene expression at other loci.",M1
16930009,"Williams-Beuren syndrome diagnosis using fluorescence in situ hybridization.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is most commonly caused by a 1.5-Mb hemizygous deletion of chromosome 7q 11.23. Other genomic rearrangements of this region have also been described, some as polymorphisms and others as rare variants, the latter often being directly associated with clinical symptoms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of either metaphase or interphase nuclei can be used to detect all of these chromosomal rearrangements, providing the ability to test this segment of chromosome 7 in families with a suspected diagnosis of WBS.",M1
16886186,"Laterality in persons with intellectual disability II. Hand, foot, ear, and eye laterality in persons with Trisomy 21 and Williams-Beuren syndrome.Laterality (hand, foot, ear, and eye) was assessed in participants with Trisomy 21 (62) and Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) (39). Handedness was also assessed in a card reaching task. The comparison group included 184 typically developing persons. Two independent age sub-groups were formed: 7 to 10 years old and 11 to 34 years old. We confirmed previous data: individuals with T21 were more frequently left- or mixed-handed than typically developing persons; individuals with WBS had intermediate scores. The two groups with genetic disorders had less right foot preference. Manual and foot inconsistencies characterized both groups with genetic disorders. Cross hand-foot preference was lower in the typically developing group. Differences in IQ levels did not correlate with differences in laterality scores. Overall laterality profiles were not the same in the two groups with genetic disorders: the greatest differences were observed between typically developing persons and persons with Trisomy 21.",M1

I--do patients with trisomy 21 and Williams-Beuren syndrome differ from typically developing persons?Persons with trisomy 21 (T21) and Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) have different brain abnormalities which may affect manual laterality. We assessed 45 persons with T21 and 34 with WBS (mean age 13) and 81 typically developing children (TD). Manual laterality was assessed with a fifteen-item task administered two times, and Bishop's card-reaching task. We found more left-handers in the T21 group compared to the other two groups. Inconsistent laterality was higher in the two groups with genetic diseases than in the TD group. For Bishop's test, both T21 and WBS participants were less right-oriented than the TD group. They displayed different response patterns in midline crossing when reaching for the cards, but did not display more midline crossing inhibition than the TD group. Is atypical handedness linked to specific genetic syndromes and, more specifically for persons with T21, to the trisomy of some of the genes?",M1
16565380,"Saccade adaptation in Williams-Beuren Syndrome.PURPOSE: To investigate the capacity for rapid saccade adaptation in Williams-Beuren Syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, in which it has been observed that saccadic accuracy is severely reduced. METHODS: Saccade amplitude modification was elicited by backward steps (30% of target eccentricity) during the primary saccade in a classic saccade-adaptation paradigm. RESULTS: Patients with WBS showed a significant decrease in saccade amplitude. Furthermore, we observed that higher saccade accuracy before adaptation was related to more adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: The increased variability in motor performance does not abolish the ability for saccadic adaptation in subjects with WBS. Our results are congruent with the notion that part of the behavioral deficits observed in WBS may have a cerebellar origin.",M1
16532385,"Hemizygosity at the NCF1 gene in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome decreases their risk of hypertension.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), caused by a heterozygous deletion at 7q11.23, represents a model for studying hypertension, the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide, in a genetically determined disorder. Haploinsufficiency at the elastin gene is known to lead to the vascular stenoses in WBS and is also thought to predispose to hypertension, present in approximately 50% of patients. Detailed clinical and molecular characterization of 96 patients with WBS was performed to explore clinical-molecular correlations. Deletion breakpoints were precisely defined and were found to result in variability at two genes, NCF1 and GTF2IRD2. Hypertension was significantly less prevalent in patients with WBS who had the deletion that included NCF1 (P=.02), a gene coding for the p47(phox) subunit of the NADPH oxidase. Decreased p47(phox) protein levels, decreased superoxide anion production, and lower protein nitrotyrosination were all observed in cell lines from patients hemizygous at NCF1. Our results indicate that the loss of a functional copy of NCF1 protects a proportion of patients with WBS against hypertension, likely through a lifelong reduced angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, antioxidant therapy that reduces NADPH oxidase activity might have a potential benefit in identifiable patients with WBS in whom serious complications related to hypertension have been reported, as well as in forms of essential hypertension mediated by a similar pathogenic mechanism.",M1
16516025,"Voiding dysfunction and the Williams-Beuren syndrome: a clinical and urodynamic investigation.PURPOSE: <e>WBS</e> is an autosomal dominant disorder that includes features such as developmental delay, cardiovascular anomalies, mental retardation and characteristic facial appearance. We systematically investigated the prevalence and spectrum of voiding dysfunction in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 16 boys and 12 girls with WBS, with a mean age of 9.7 years (range 3 to 19). Urological evaluation included history of urinary symptoms and impact on quality of life, voiding diary, urodynamics and radiological evaluation with urinary tract sonography, voiding cystourethrography and renal scintigraphy. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (78.6%) were symptomatic, including 15 (53.6%) with a significant negative impact on the quality of life. Increased urinary frequency was the most common complaint, present in 17 patients (60.7%), followed by enuresis (50%) and urge incontinence (42.8%). A total of 14 patients (50%) had urinary tract abnormalities, with bladder diverticula as the predominant anomaly (10 of 23 patients, or 43.5%). Urodynamics revealed detrusor overactivity in 17 patients (60.7%), detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia with detrusor overactivity in 4 (14.3%) and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia without detrusor overactivity in 2 (7.1%). An average reduction of 28.3% of the cystometric capacity in comparison to expected capacity for age was found (p &lt;0.001). Urodynamic abnormalities were significantly associated with the presence of voiding symptoms (p = 0.003) and bladder diverticula (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with the Williams-Beuren syndrome are at high risk for presenting with voiding dysfunction and structural abnormalities, and should undergo a minimum evaluation that includes voiding history and urinary tract sonography, while urodynamics, VCUG and additional studies should be performed in symptomatic patients or those whose initial evaluation shows significant abnormalities.",M1
16293761,"GTF2IRD1 in craniofacial development of humans and mice.Craniofacial abnormalities account for about one-third of all human congenital defects, but our understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing craniofacial development is incomplete. We show that GTF2IRD1 is a genetic determinant of mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development, and we implicate another member of the TFII-I transcription factor family, GTF2I, in both aspects. Gtf2ird1-null mice exhibit phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>); craniofacial imaging reveals abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through misregulation of goosecoid, a downstream target of Gtf2ird1. In humans, a rare WBS individual with an atypical deletion, including GTF2IRD1, shows facial dysmorphism and cognitive deficits that differ from those of classic WBS cases. We propose a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.",M1
16207621,"Increased prevalences of left-handedness and left-eye sighting dominance in individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome.Handedness and eye sighting dominance were assessed in a sample of 50 individuals (25 male, 25 female; aged 5-38 years) with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). The prevalences of left-handedness and left-eyedness were compared to the normative prevalences in the general population. We found significantly higher prevalences of left-handedness and left-eyedness in the WBS sample. The higher prevalences were more salient in younger than in older individuals and in male than in female individuals. We suggest that the increased prevalence of left-handedness in WBS is a consequence of a slower maturation rate, which allows deviation from a predetermined laterality pattern.",M1
16140988,"Evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomic structure of the Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region at human 7q11.23.About 5% of the human genome consists of segmental duplications or low-copy repeats, which are large, highly homologous (&gt;95%) fragments of sequence. It has been estimated that these segmental duplications emerged during the past approximately 35 million years (Myr) of human evolution and that they correlate with chromosomal rearrangements. Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a segmental aneusomy syndrome that is the result of a frequent de novo deletion at 7q11.23, mediated by large (approximately 400-kb) region-specific complex segmental duplications composed of different blocks. We have precisely defined the structure of the segmental duplications on human 7q11.23 and characterized the copy number and structure of the orthologous regions in other primates (macaque, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee). Our data indicate a recent origin and rapid evolution of the 7q11.23 segmental duplications, starting before the diversification of hominoids (approximately 12-16 million years ago [Mya]), with species-specific duplications and intrachromosomal rearrangements that lead to significant differences among those genomes. Alu sequences are located at most edges of the large hominoid-specific segmental duplications, suggesting that they might have facilitated evolutionary rearrangements. We propose a mechanistic model based on Alu-mediated duplicated transposition along with nonallelic homologous recombination for the generation and local expansion of the segmental duplications. The extraordinary rate of evolutionary turnover of this region, rich in segmental duplications, results in important genomic variation among hominoid species, which could be of functional relevance and predispose to disease.",M1

Using functional neuroimaging, we found reduced amygdala activation in individuals with WBS for threatening faces but increased activation for threatening scenes, relative to matched normal controls. Activation and interactions of prefrontal regions linked to amygdala, especially orbitofrontal cortex, were abnormal, suggesting a genetically controlled neural circuitry for regulating human social behavior.",M1
15994861,"Two high throughput technologies to detect segmental aneuploidies identify new Williams-Beuren syndrome patients with atypical deletions.OBJECTIVE: To develop and compare two new technologies for diagnosing a contiguous gene syndrome, the Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). METHODS: The first proposed method, named paralogous sequence quantification (PSQ), is based on the use of paralogous sequences located on different chromosomes and quantification of specific mismatches present at these loci using pyrosequencing technology. The second exploits quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to assess the relative quantity of an analysed locus. RESULTS: A correct and unambiguous diagnosis was obtained for 100% of the analysed samples with either technique (n = 165 and n = 155, respectively). These methods allowed the identification of two patients with atypical deletions in a cohort of 182 WBS patients. Both patients presented with mild facial anomalies, mild mental retardation with impaired visuospatial cognition, supravalvar aortic stenosis, and normal growth indices. These observations are consistent with the involvement of GTF2IRD1 or GTF2I in some of the WBS facial features. CONCLUSIONS: Both PSQ and QPCR are robust, easy to interpret, and simple to set up. They represent a competitive alternative for the diagnosis of segmental aneuploidies in clinical laboratories. They have advantages over fluorescence in situ hybridisation or microsatellites/SNP genotyping for detecting short segmental aneuploidies as the former is costly and labour intensive while the latter depends on the informativeness of the polymorphisms.",M1
15965761,"Visual depth processing in Williams-Beuren syndrome.Patients with Williams-Beuren Syndrome (<e>WBS</e>, also known as Williams Syndrome) show many problems in motor activities requiring visuo-motor integration, such as walking stairs. We tested to what extent these problems might be related to a deficit in the perception of visual depth or to problems in using this information in guiding movements. Monocular and binocular visual depth perception was tested in 33 patients with WBS. Furthermore, hand movements to a target were recorded in conditions with and without visual feedback of the position of the hand. The WBS group was compared to a group of control subjects. The WBS patients were able to perceive monocular depth cues that require global processing, but about 49% failed to show stereopsis. On average, patients with WBS moved their hand too far when no visual feedback on hand position was given. This was not so when they could see their hand. Patients with WBS are able to derive depth from complex spatial relationships between objects. However, they seem to be impaired in using depth information for guiding their movements when deprived of visual feedback. We conclude that the problems that WBS patients have with tasks such as descending stairs are not due to an inability to judge distance.",M1
15933846,"Observation of a parental inversion variant in a rare Williams-Beuren syndrome family with two affected children.The Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) region at 7q11.23 is subject to several genomic rearrangements, one of which, the WBSinv-1 variant, is an inversion polymorphism. The WBSinv-1 chromosome has been shown to occur frequently in parents of individuals with WBS, implying that it predisposes the region to the WBS deletion. Here we investigate two WBS families with multiple affected children, and show that in one family, both siblings have a deletion on a WBSinv-1 chromosome background that arose due to interchromosomal recombination. These results suggest that the two WBS deletions in this family were independent events, and that there is likely a significant increase in the risk of deletion of the WBS region associated with the WBSinv-1 chromosome. The rarity of multiplex WBS families would suggest that the overall risk of having a child with WBS is still relatively low; however, families with an existing member with WBS may choose to opt for WBSinv-1 testing and genetic counseling.",M1
15832055,"Vascular wall remodeling in patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams Beuren syndrome.Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and Williams Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) can be considered as inherited diseases affecting the whole arterial tree and causing narrowing of the vessels. It has been reported that abnormal deposition of elastin in arterial walls of patients with SVAS and WBS leads to increased proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC), which result in the formation of hyperplastic intimal lesions. In this work, we conducted morphological and morphometrical analysis with stenotic aortas from patients suffering from SVAS and WBS and from healthy control subjects and demonstrated that the amount of elastic fibers and the loss of integrity of vascular elastic fibers in the aortas reflect similar changes in the skin of patients with SVAS or WBS, as reported in our previous work conducted on skin in these pathological states. On the other hand, we conducted investigations on metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP9, MMP7) and their specific tissue inhibitors TIMP1 and TIMP2 to verify their possible involvement in the etiopathogeny of SVAS and WBS. We particularly evidenced an altered MMP9/TIMP1 balance in favor of matrix degradation which could facilitate SMC migration and neointimal hyperplasia. Our findings suggest that elastinolytic enzymes secreted by arterial SMC, possibly including matrilysin 1, are critical for the development of arterial lesions in SVAS and WBS and contribute to perpetuate arterial stenosis in either SVAS or WBS.",M1
15770126,"Autosomal dominant inheritance of Williams-Beuren syndrome in a father and son with haploinsufficiency for FKBP6.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurodevelopmental microdeletion disorder that usually occurs sporadically due to its location within a highly repetitive genomic region that is unstable and prone to unequal cross-over during meiosis. The consequential loss of chromosomal material includes approximately 1.5 Mb of DNA at 7q11.23. Whilst cases of dominant inheritance have been described in the literature, there have been few reports of molecular confirmation and none have carried out detailed genotyping. We describe a Bulgarian father and son with WBS detected by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (with an elastin gene probe) and loss of heterozygosity mapping using microsatellite markers located in the critical region. These individuals appear to have a common WBS heterozygous deletion, confirming the expected dominant transmission and adding to the few familial cases reported. The deletion includes the gene FKBP6 which has recently been shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis and male fertility in mouse models. Homozygous Fkbp6 -/- male mice are infertile and our data suggests that haploinsufficiency for FKBP6 does not appear to preclude male fertility in WBS, although male infertility involving this gene has the potential to follow the mouse model as a human autosomal recessive condition.",M1
15751610,"Growth hormone deficiency in a child with Williams-Beuren syndrome. The response to growth hormone therapy.Pre- and postnatal growth retardation of unknown pathogenesis is a common clinical feature in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). However, growth hormone deficiency (GHD) has not been considered a major cause of growth retardation. There is only one patient in the literature with confirmed GHD who responded well to human growth hormone (hGH) therapy. We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy. Height SDS was -4.2 at the age of 12 months when hGH was initiated and increased to -0.8 at the age of 4.25 years. The pathogenesis of GHD in our patient is unclear. Nevertheless, the elevated levels of prolactin and the response of hGH to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration are indicative of a hypothalamic rather than pituitary defect. In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height.",M1
15572594,"Frizzled 9 knock-out mice have abnormal B-cell development.The binding of frizzled (Fzd) receptors by their Wnt ligands results in the inhibition of beta-catenin degradation and subsequent transcription of beta-catenin/LEF-inducible genes. The beta-catenin pathway is known to be involved in development, tumorigenesis, and stem cell self-renewal. In humans, the FZD9 gene lies in the region of chromosome 7q11.23 deleted in the neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). Fzd9-/- mice show no obvious features of WBS, but reveal a role for Fzd9 in lymphoid development and maturation. Fzd9-/- mice show pronounced splenomegaly, thymic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy with age, with accumulation of plasma cells in lymph nodes. There is a depletion of developing B cells in the bone marrow (BM), particularly in the pre-B stage where immunoglobulin heavy chains are expressed and the cells are undergoing clonal expansion prior to light chain rearrangement. The pre-B defect is partially intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; as in competitive BM reconstitution studies, Fzd9-/- -derived BM exhibits defective B-cell development when implanted into a wild-type host. Mature B cells are present in normal numbers in lymph node and spleen. These findings suggest a role for Fzd9 signaling in lymphoid development, particularly at points where B cells undergo self-renewal prior to further differentiation.",M1
15388857,"Comparison of TFII-I gene family members deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurological disorder resulting from a microdeletion, typically 1.5 megabases in size, at 7q11.23. Atypical patients implicate genes at the telomeric end of this multigene deletion as the main candidates for the pathology of WBS in particular the unequal cognitive profile associated with the condition. We recently identified a gene (GTF2IRD2) that shares homology with other members of a unique family of transcription factors (TFII-I family), which reside in the critical telomeric region. Using bioinformatics tools this study focuses on the detailed assessment of this gene family, concentrating on their characteristic structural components such as the leucine zipper (LZ) and I-repeat elements, in an attempt to identify features that could aid functional predictions. Phylogenetic analysis identified distinct I-repeat clades shared between family members. Linking functional data to one such clade has implicated them in DNA binding. The identification of PEST, synergy control motifs, and sumoylation sites common to all family members suggest a shared mechanism regulating the stability and transcriptional activity of these factors. In addition, the identification/isolation of short truncated isoforms for each TFII-I family member implies a mode of self-regulation. The exceptionally high identity shared between GTF2I and GTF2IRD2, suggests that heterodimers as well as homodimers are possible, and indicates overlapping functions between their respective short isoforms. Such cross-reactivity between GTF2I and GTF2IRD2 short isoforms might have been the evolutionary driving force for the 7q11.23 chromosomal rearrangement not present in the syntenic region in mice.",M1

RESULTS: We report a 14-mo-old male infant presenting hypercalcaemia, elfin face and other dysmorphological features of WBS, confirmed by the FISH fluorescent test. Due to the marked symptomatic hypercalcaemia, 13.0 mg/dl intravenous Pamidronate was administered in a single dose of 1 mg/kg.

15262813,"Exploring Williams-Beuren syndrome using myGrid.MOTIVATION: In silico experiments necessitate the virtual organization of people, data, tools and machines. The scientific process also necessitates an awareness of the experience base, both of personal data as well as the wider context of work. The management of all these data and the co-ordination of resources to manage such virtual organizations and the data surrounding them needs significant computational infra-structure support. RESULTS: In this paper, we show that (my)Grid, middleware for the Semantic Grid, enables biologists to perform and manage in silico experiments, then explore and exploit the results of their experiments. We demonstrate (my)Grid in the context of a series of bioinformatics experiments focused on a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 7 which is deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). Due to the highly repetitive nature of sequence flanking/in the WBS critical region (WBSCR), sequencing of the region is incomplete leaving documented gaps in the released sequence. (my)Grid was used in a series of experiments to find newly sequenced human genomic DNA clones that extended into these 'gap' regions in order to produce a complete and accurate map of the WBSCR. Once placed in this region, these DNA sequences were analysed with a battery of prediction tools in order to locate putative genes and regulatory elements possibly implicated in the disorder. Finally, any genes discovered were submitted to a range of standard bioinformatics tools for their characterization. We report how (my)Grid has been used to create workflows for these in silico experiments, run those workflows regularly and notify the biologist when new DNA and genes are discovered.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A series of 82 patients (47 males and 35 females) who consulted at the hospital because of mental retardation and/or congenital cardiopathy were included. The patients were studied mainly from a neurological and cardiological point of view, and secondarily because of endocrinological and nephrological problems. Since description of the chromosomal abnormalities provoking the syndrome, we perform karyotyping in all patients with suspected WBS. RESULTS: Alterations mainly consisted of distinctive facial appearance (100 %), mental retardation with friendly behavior (90 %), congenital cardiopathy (85.4 %), mostly consisting of supravalvular aortic stenosis (72 %), with (12 %) or without (60 %) pulmonary stenosis, and behavior typical of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, which usually manifested at the age of 4 to 5 years in both boys and girls. Approximately 90 % started to walk and speak later than average. Birthweight was below 3000 g in 65 % of the patients in whom this datum was included in the medical record. Eleven of the 13 patients (84.5 %) studied showed the typical deletion of WBS. CONCLUSION: Study of patients with WBS should be multidisciplinary.

15163635,"The subcellular localization of the ChoRE-binding protein, encoded by the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region gene 14, is regulated by 14-3-3.The Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a contiguous gene syndrome caused by chromosomal rearrangements at chromosome band 7q11.23. Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance and silent diabetes, have been described for this clinically complex disorder. The WBSCR14 gene, one of the genes mapping to the WBS critical region, encodes a member of the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors, which dimerizes with the Max-like protein, Mlx. This heterodimeric complex binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner, carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of lipogenic enzymes. We identified five novel WBSCR14-interacting proteins, four 14-3-3 isotypes and NIF3L1, which form a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. Phosphatase treatment abrogates the association between WBSCR14 and 14-3-3, as shown previously for multiple 14-3-3 interactors. WBSCR14 is exported actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This translocation is contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. Through this mechanism the 14-3-3 isotypes directly affect the WBSCR14:Mlx complexes, which activate the transcription of lipogenic genes.",M1

The occurrence of sudden death in the WBS is known from several case reports, but information about the risk of sudden death as derived from the data of a large cohort of patients is lacking. We analyzed the data of 293 WBS patients who had been treated for 43 years at the same two institutions. We thus collected 5,190 patient years without loss to follow-up. During this period ten patients died. Five of them died from: reticulosarcoma (1), after accident (1), heart failure (1), following heart surgery (2). Of the remaining five patients, four died suddenly and one died of unknown cause suggestive of sudden cardiac death. Thus, the incidence of sudden death in our WBS cohort amounts to 1/1,000 patient years. This risk of sudden death is comparable to that following surgery for congenital heart disease, and is 25-100-fold higher compared to the age-matched normal population.",M1
15100712,"Isolation and characterisation of GTF2IRD2, a novel fusion gene and member of the TFII-I family of transcription factors, deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a developmental disorder with characteristic physical, cognitive and behavioural traits caused by a microdeletion of approximately 1.5 Mb on chromosome 7q11.23. In total, 24 genes have been described within the deleted region to date. We have isolated and characterised a novel human gene, GTF2IRD2, mapping to the WBS critical region thought to harbour genes important for the cognitive aspects of the disorder. GTF2IRD2 is the third member of the novel TFII-I family of genes clustered on 7q11.23. The GTF2IRD2 protein contains two putative helix-loop-helix regions (I-repeats) and an unusual C-terminal CHARLIE8 transposon-like domain, thought to have arisen as a consequence of the random insertion of a transposable element generating a functional fusion gene. The retention of a number of conserved transposase-associated motifs within the protein suggests that the CHARLIE8-like region may still have some degree of transposase functionality that could influence the stability of the region in a mechanism similar to that proposed for Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A. GTF2IRD2 is highly conserved in mammals and the mouse ortholgue (Gtf2ird2) has also been isolated and maps to the syntenic WBS region on mouse chromosome 5G. Deletion mapping studies using somatic cell hybrids show that some WBS patients are hemizygous for this gene, suggesting that it could play a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder.",M1

Since visual perception and eye movements are closely related we hypothesized that the poor visuo-spatial processing capacities of subjects with WBS might be related to a poor saccadic control. Thereto, we recorded horizontal and vertical saccadic eye movements to targets using infrared video-oculography in 27 subjects with WBS and eight healthy controls. In the WBS group saccadic gains were highly variable, both between and within individual subjects, and they often needed more than one correction saccade to reach the target. Ten (out of a subgroup of 22) WBS subjects showed a large number of hypometric and/or hypermetric saccades, and, also a left-right asymmetry in saccadic gains was observed in WBS.

Children with Prader-Willi syndrome lack a paternally derived copy of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, and eat uncontrollably; in Angelman syndrome lack of a maternal contribution of 15q11-q13 results in absence of speech, frequent smiling and episodes of paroxysmal laughter; deletions on 22q11 can be associated with obsessive behaviour and schizophrenia. The neurodevelopmental disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), is caused by a microdeletion at 7q11.23 and provides us with one of the most convincing models of a relationship that links genes with human cognition and behaviour. The hypothesis is that deletion of one or a series of genes causes neurodevelopmental abnormalities that manifest as the fractionation of mental abilities typical of WBS. Detailed molecular characterization of the deletion alongside well-defined cognitive profiling in WBS provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neuromolecular basis of complex cognitive behaviour, and develop integrated approaches to study gene function and genotype-phenotype correlations.",M1
12796854,"Mutational mechanisms of Williams-Beuren syndrome deletions.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a segmental aneusomy syndrome that results from a heterozygous deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11.23. Three large region-specific low-copy repeat elements (LCRs), composed of different blocks (A, B, and C), flank the WBS deletion interval and are thought to predispose to misalignment and unequal crossing-over, causing the deletions. In this study, we have determined the exact deletion size and LCR copy number in 74 patients with WBS, as well as precisely defined deletion breakpoints in 30 of them, using LCR-specific nucleotide differences. Most patients (95%) exhibit a 1.55-Mb deletion caused by recombination between centromeric and medial block B copies, which share approximately 99.6% sequence identity along 105-143 kb. In these cases, deletion breakpoints were mapped at several sites within the recombinant block B, with a cluster (&gt;27%) occurring at a 12 kb region within the GTF2I/GTF2IP1 gene. Almost one-third (28%) of the transmitting progenitors were found to be heterozygous for an inversion between centromeric and telomeric LCRs. All deletion breakpoints in the patients with the inversion occurred in the distal 38-kb block B region only present in the telomeric and medial copies. Finally, only four patients (5%) displayed a larger deletion ( approximately 1.84 Mb) caused by recombination between centromeric and medial block A copies. We propose models for the specific pairing and precise aberrant recombination leading to each of the different germline rearrangements that occur in this region, including inversions and deletions associated with WBS. Chromosomal instability at 7q11.23 is directly related to the genomic structure of the region.",M1

However, with the exception of arterial stenoses caused by haploinsufficiency for the elastin gene (ELN), no specific implication of any other gene in the phenotype has been established. We present two patients with portal hypertension leading to splenomegaly and pancytopenia carrying the common 1.5 Mb WBS deletion. We propose this is an additional severe vascular complication of ELN deficiency and discuss the specific characteristics of the portal venous tract that could explain the impact of ELN deficiency in that venous territory. This complication is potentially lethal and should thus be considered in any patient with WBS and splenomegaly.",M1

Most WBS patients have a &gt;1 Mb deletion on one of their chromosomes 7 in q11 but except for elastin, whose haploinsufficiency causes the cardiovascular malformations, it is unknown which genes in the deletion area contribute to the phenotype. We have investigated a family with a cytogenetically balanced translocation t(7;16)(q11.23;q13) in which affected individuals manifested a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from a hoarse voice as the only feature to the full WBS phenotype. Molecular cytogenetic and DNA sequence analyses of the translocation breakpoint showed that the cytogenetic rearrangement disrupts the elastin gene locus within intron 5 in the exact same manner in all translocation carriers. The recently described large inversion of the 7q11.23 region was not present in this family. Our data demonstrate that disruption of the elastin gene by a translocation breakpoint may cause classical WBS, atypical WBS, SVAS, or no recognisable phenotype, and provide a clear example for extensive phenotypic variability associated with a position effect in humans.",M1

12016585,"Connection between elastin haploinsufficiency and increased cell proliferation in patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams-Beuren syndrome.To elucidate the pathomechanism leading to obstructive vascular disease in patients with elastin deficiency, we compared both elastogenesis and proliferation rate of cultured aortic smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) and skin fibroblasts from five healthy control subjects, four patients with isolated supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), and five patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). Mutations were determined in each patient with SVAS and in each patient with WBS. Three mutations found in patients with SVAS were shown to result in null alleles. RNA blot hybridization, immunostaining, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that SVAS cells and WBS cells have reduced elastin mRNA levels and that they consequently deposit low amounts of insoluble elastin. Although SVAS cells laid down approximately 50% of the elastin made by normal cells, WBS cells deposited only 15% of the elastin made by normal cells. The observed difference in elastin-gene expression was not caused by a difference in the stability of elastin mRNA in SVAS cells compared with WBS cells, but it did indicate that gene-interaction effects may contribute to the complex phenotype observed in patients with WBS. Abnormally low levels of elastin deposition in SVAS cells and in WBS cells were found to coincide with an increase in proliferation rate, which could be reversed by addition of exogenous insoluble elastin. We conclude that insoluble elastin is an important regulator of cellular proliferation. Thus, the reduced net deposition of insoluble elastin in arterial walls of patients with either SVAS or WBS leads to the increased proliferation of arterial SMCs. This results in the formation of multilayer thickening of the tunica media of large arteries and, consequently, in the development of hyperplastic intimal lesions leading to segmental arterial occlusion.",M1

Large repeats containing genes and pseudogenes flank the deletion breakpoints, and the mutation mechanism commonly appears to be unequal meiotic crossover. Except for elastin, hemizygosity of which is associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis, it is unknown which of the 18 genes in the deletion area contributes to the phenotype. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two novel genes, WBSCR20 and WBSCR22, which map to the common WBS deletion region. WBSCR22 encodes a putative methyltransferase protein strongly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. WBSCR20 encodes a novel protein expressed in skeletal muscle with similarity to p120 (NOL1), a 120-kDa proliferation-associated nucleolar antigen, a member of an evolutionarily conserved protein family. A highly similar putative gene, WBSCR20B, flanks the WBS deletion at the telomeric side.

Five aspects of music were tested. There were two tests of core music domains, pitch discrimination and rhythm discrimination. There were two tests of musical expressiveness, melodic imagery and phrasing. There was one test of musical interpretation, the ability to identify the emotional resonance of a musical excerpt. Music scores were analyzed by means of logistic regressions that modeled outcome (higher or lower music scores) as a function of group membership (WBS or Control) and cognitive age. Compared to age peers, children with WBS had similar levels of musical expressiveness, but were less able to discriminate pitch and rhythm, or to attach a semantic interpretation to emotion in music. Music skill did not vary with cognitive age. Musical strength in individuals with WBS involves not so much formal analytic skill in pitch and rhythm discrimination as a strong engagement with music as a means of expression, play, and, perhaps, improvisation.",M1
11685205,"A 1.5 million-base pair inversion polymorphism in families with Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is most often caused by hemizygous deletion of a 1.5-Mb interval encompassing at least 17 genes at 7q11.23 (refs. 1,2). As with many other haploinsufficiency diseases, the mechanism underlying the WBS deletion is thought to be unequal meiotic recombination, probably mediated by the highly homologous DNA that flanks the commonly deleted region. Here, we report the use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify a genomic polymorphism in families with WBS, consisting of an inversion of the WBS region. We have observed that the inversion is hemizygous in 3 of 11 (27%) atypical affected individuals who show a subset of the WBS phenotypic spectrum but do not carry the typical WBS microdeletion. Two of these individuals also have a parent who carries the inversion. In addition, in 4 of 12 (33%) families with a proband carrying the WBS deletion, we observed the inversion exclusively in the parent transmitting the disease-related chromosome. These results suggest the presence of a newly identified genomic variant within the population that may be associated with the disease. It may result in predisposition to primarily WBS-causing microdeletions, but may also cause translocations and inversions.",M1

Here, we report the functional characterization of WBS critical region gene 14 (WBSCR14), a gene contained in the WBS commonly deleted region. It encodes a basic-helix--loop--helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor of the Myc/Max/Mad superfamily. WBSCR14 is expressed in multiple tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract. WBSCR14 forms heterodimers with the bHLHZip protein Mlx to bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max, Mlx has no intrinsic transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1, Mad4, Mnt or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription. Preliminary results suggest a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth control. Our data support the view that the Max-like bHLHZip protein, Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network. We thus suggest that WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.",M1

Clinical and molecular genetic study of 44 patients with suspected Williams-Beuren syndrome]BACKGROUND: The suspected diagnosis of Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), which is a retardation syndrome with great clinical variability, was cause for comparison of molecular genetic, molecular cytogenetic analysis to clinical symptoms. The results of the genetical analysis of a microdeletion of the elastin gene region on chromosome 7 were compared to the clinical symptoms. Are there any differences between symptoms in case of deletion or non-deletion? How informative are the molecular genetic, molecular cytogenetic analysis? PATIENTS AND METHODS: 44 patients with suspected diagnosis of WBS were examined using molecular genetic and molecular cytogenetic methods. The clinical symptoms as general symptoms, heart anomaly, dysmorphic signs and unusual neurobehavioural features were reported during clinical investigation in standardized questionnaires. The genomic DNA of the patients and their parents was analyzed using microsatellite markers. In some cases (e.g. uninformative microsatellite studies) we also used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with an elastin gene probe and performed a conventional chromosome banding analysis. RESULTS: 15 patients had a microdeletion. 4 patients had a deletion of the paternal allel and 7 patients showed the deletion of the maternal allel. The polymorphisms were of limited informativeness. In 2 cases microsatellite analysis was not able to determine whether the paternal or the maternal allel had been lost. In 2 cases the microsatellite analysis was uninformative so that FISH analysis was performed. All FISH analysis performed had an informative result. 80% of the children with a microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23 showed the typical dysmorphic signs, 70% exhibited the typical WBS behaviour pattern, 50% had a specific heart anomaly. In contrast, in the group of children without a chromosomal microdeletion only 30-40% showed typical dysmorphic signs, only 10% had a typical heart anomaly and none of them showed specific behavioural changes. We found no indication to association of specific symptoms with paternal versus maternal origin of the deletion. The FISH analysis combined with a conventional chromosome banding analysis is very informative for diagnostic values. The results are compared to data of literature. CONCLUSIONS: Children with developmental retardation and WBS dysmorphic signs and an unusual behaviour should be examined by a molecular cytogenetic FISH analysis. If a microdeletion of band 7q11.23 is found a special cardiologic examination should be offered.",M1

A common deletion including at least 16-17 genes has been defined in the great majority of patients. We have completed a physical and transcription map of the WBS region based on analysis of high-throughput genome sequence data and assembly of a BAC/PAC/YAC contig, including the characterization of large blocks of gene-containing low-copy-number repeat elements that flank the commonly deleted interval. The WBS deletions arise as a consequence of unequal crossing over between these highly homologous sequences, which confer susceptibility to local chromosome rearrangements. We have also completed a clone contig, genetic, and long-range restriction map of the mouse homologous region, including the orthologues of all identified genes in the human map. The order of the intradeletion genes appears to be conserved in mouse, and no low-copy-number repeats are found in the region. However, the deletion region is inverted relative to the human map, exactly at the flanking regions. Thus, we have identified an evolutionary inversion with chromosomal breakpoints at the sites where the human 7q11.23 low-copy-number repeats are located. Additional comparative mapping suggests a model for human chromosome 7 evolution due to serial inversions leading to genomic duplications. This high-resolution mouse map provides the framework required for the generation of mouse models for WBS mimicking the human molecular defect.",M1

A common interval that includes up to 17 genes reported so far is deleted in the great majority of patients. Elastin haploinsufficiency is responsible for the cardiovascular features, but the specific contribution of other deleted genes to the WBS phenotype remains unknown. We have fully characterised a gene commonly deleted in WBS, WBSCR14, previously reported in a truncated form as WS-bHLH. The WBSCR14 cDNA encodes an 852amino acid protein with a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper motif (bHLHZip) and a bipartite nuclear localisation signal (BNLS), suggesting a function as a transcription factor. WBSCR14 is expressed as a 4.2kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and at late stages of foetal development. The WBSCR14 locus encompasses 33 kb of genomic DNA with 17 exons. Two intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats have been identified and used to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. We have also cloned the mouse ortholog and mapped its locus to mouse chromosome 5, in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23. Given that other bHLHZip proteins are dosage sensitive and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor, hemizygosity at this locus could be involved in some features of WBS.",M1

We report the identification of human and mouse cDNA coding for stromalin 3 (STAG3), a new mammalian stromalin member of the synaptonemal complex. The stromalins are a group of highly conserved proteins, represented in several organisms from yeast to humans. Stromalins are characterized by the stromalin conservative domain (SCD), a specific motif found in all proteins of the family described to date. STAG3 is expressed specifically in testis, and immunolocalization experiments show that STAG3 is associated to the synaptonemal complex. As the protein encoded by the homologous gene (Scc3p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be a subunit of a cohesin complex that binds chromosomes until the onset of anaphase, our data suggest that STAG3 is involved in chromosome pairing and maintenance of synaptonemal complex structure during the pachytene phase of meiosis in a cohesin-like manner. We have mapped the human STAG3 gene to the 7q22 region of chromosome 7; six human STAG3-related genes have also been mapped: two at 7q22 near the functional gene, one at 7q11.22, and three at 7q11.23, two of them flanking the breakpoints commonly associated with the Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) deletion. Since the WBS deletion occurs as a consequence of unequal meiotic crossing over, we suggest that STAG3 duplications predispose to germline chromosomal rearrangement within this region.",M1

With the exception of vascular stenoses due to deletion of the elastin gene, the various features of WBS have not yet been attributed to specific genes. Although &gt;/=16 genes have been identified within the WBS deletion, completion of a physical map of the region has been difficult because of the large duplicated regions flanking the deletion. We present a physical map of the WBS deletion and flanking regions, based on assembly of a bacterial artificial chromosome/P1-derived artificial chromosome contig, analysis of high-throughput genome-sequence data, and long-range restriction mapping of genomic and cloned DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Our map encompasses 3 Mb, including 1.6 Mb within the deletion. Two large duplicons, flanking the deletion, of &gt;/=320 kb contain unique sequence elements from the internal border regions of the deletion, such as sequences from GTF2I (telomeric) and FKBP6 (centromeric). A third copy of this duplicon exists in inverted orientation distal to the telomeric flanking one. These duplicons show stronger sequence conservation with regard to each other than to the presumptive ancestral loci within the common deletion region. Sequence elements originating from beyond 7q11.23 are also present in these duplicons. Although the duplicons are not present in mice, the order of the single-copy genes in the conserved syntenic region of mouse chromosome 5 is inverted relative to the human map.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel gene named GTF2IRD1, for GTF2I-repeat domain 1, within the WBS deletion region. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression during development with two transcripts of 3.6 kb and 5.0 kb generated by alternative splicing. GTF2IRD1 encodes a protein of 944 amino acids that contains a region of high similarity to a unique motif with helix-loop-helix forming potential occurring within the transcription factor GTF2I. Analogous to TFII-I, the product of GTF2IRD1 may have the ability to interact with other HLH-proteins and function as a transcription factor or as a negative transcriptional regulator. A recent report of the identification of a muscle-specific transcription factor, MusTRD1, supports this hypothesis (O'Mahoney et al., 1998). The open reading frame described for MusTRD1 is identical to that of GTF2IRD1; however, the putative MusTRD1-protein is 486 amino acids shorter than the predicted protein encoded by GTF2IRD1. A heterozygous deletion of GTF2IRD1 may contribute to the complex WBS phenotype.",M1

The size of the deletion is similar in most patients due to a genomic duplication that predisposes to unequal meiotic crossover events. While hemizygosity at the elastin locus is responsible for the cardiovascular features, the contribution of other genes to the WBS phenotype remains to be demonstrated. We have identified a novel gene, TBL2, in the common WBS deletion. TBL2 is expressed as a 2. 4-kb transcript predominantly in testis, skeletal muscle, heart and some endocrine tissues, with a larger approximately 5-kb transcript detected ubiquitously at lower levels. TBL2 encodes a protein with four putative WD40-repeats. An alternatively spliced transcript in TBL2 introduces a novel second exon with an in frame stop codon. This mRNA encodes a 75 amino acid protein with 43 amino acids identical to TBL2 at the N-terminus and no known functional domain. The mouse homolog, Tbl2, shows 84% sequence identity at the nucleotide level and 92% similarity at the amino acid level. Comparison of the mouse and human sequences identifies a conserved region that extends upstream of the previously published sequence with an initiation codon common to both species that adds 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. The Tbl2 gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23. Since haploinsufficiency has been shown for other WD-repeat containing proteins, hemizygosity of TBL2 may contribute to some of the aspects of the complex WBS phenotype.",M1

Radiation hybrid mapping has shown that this gene is localized 2.33 cR telomeric to D7S1870, a polymorphic marker located at the most telomeric end of the common deletion region of Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). This suggests that haploinsufficiency of 14-3-3gamma may not contribute to the WBS phenotype.

Furthermore, the present data do not support presence of imprinted genes in the WBS common deletion despite a nonsignificant excess of maternal over paternal deletions. Maternal deletion cases were more likely to have a large head circumference in the present data. Also, pairwise comparisons between individual WBS clinical features have been conducted and revealed significant associations between (1) low birth weight and poor postnatal weight gain (&lt;10th percentile at the time of examination) and (2) transient infantile hypercalcemia and a stellate iris pattern.

10198163,"Characterization and expression pattern of the frizzled gene Fzd9, the mouse homolog of FZD9 which is deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome.The frizzled gene family is conserved from insects to mammals and codes for putative Wnt receptors that share a cysteine-rich extracellular domain and seven transmembrane domains. We previously identified a novel frizzled gene, FZD3, now renamed FZD9, in the Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) deletion region at chromosomal band 7q11.23 and showed that its product can interact with the Drosophila wingless protein. Here, we report the characterization of the mouse homolog Fzd9. The Fzd9 gene produces a 2.4-kb transcript encoding a 592-amino-acid protein with 95% identity to the human FZD9. Fzd9 was mapped to the conserved syntenic region on distal mouse chromosome 5. By RNA in situ hybridization studies of whole-mount embryos and sections we delineated the temporal and spatial expression patterns in the neural tube, trunk skeletal muscle precursors (myotomes), limb skeletal anlagen, craniofacial regions, and nephric ducts. In adult mouse tissue, the Fzd9 transcript is abundantly present in heart, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle. In testis, Fzd9 is expressed in all spermatogenic cell types. Immunohistochemical studies of cells transfected with a Fzd9 expression construct confirm that Fzd9 is a membrane protein. These results suggest potential Wnt ligands of Fzd9, a role of Fzd9 in skeletal muscle specification, and contributions of FZD9 to the WBS phenotype.",M1
9926515,"FISH analysis in both classical and atypical cases of Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by distinct facial changes, growth deficiency, mental retardation, supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS)/peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and associated at times with infantile hypercalcemia. A pilot study has been carried out to assess the reliability of the detection of hemizygosity at the elastin locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis as a diagnostic test in both classical and atypical WBS. Eight subjects with classical WBS and four others in whom a diagnosis could not be confirmed on clinical criteria alone were enrolled. In the classical WBS group, five (5/8) had a visible interstitial 7q11.22-11.23 deletion detected by high-resolution banding, and all (8/8) had a submicroscopic deletion of the elastin locus on chromosome 7 by FISH analysis. In the atypical WBS group, only one (1/4) had elastin deletion. The other three, with isolated SVAS, had normal development and minimal signs of WBS. Furthermore, the patients with microscopic 7q11.22-11.23 deletion have more associated features of WBS than those without visible interstitial deletions by high-resolution banding. These results, therefore, emphasize the importance of a combined high-resolution and molecular cytogenetic (i.e., FISH) approach to diagnosis and suggest that the degree to which microscopic/submicroscopic deletions of chromosome 7 extending in beyond the elastin locus may explain some of the phenotypical variability found in WBS.",M1

He had a deletion of 7q11.23 at the ELN locus. The mother was diagnosed after the identification of WBS in her affected son. She is deceased and was thus not studied by FISH.

Haploinsufficiency of genes deleted in chromosomal region 7q11.23 is the likely cause for this syndrome. We now report the localization of the genes for the CPE-R (Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin receptor, CPETR1) and the human homolog of RVP1 (rat ventral prostate 1 protein, CPETR2), both previously mapped to 7q11, to the WBS critical region. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in CPETR1 has been identified and was used to determine parental origin of the deleted allele in five informative families. The mouse homologs Cpetr1 and Cpetr2 were identified and mapped to the conserved syntenic region on mouse chromosome 5. Northern blot analysis of CPETR1 demonstrates tissue specificity, with expression in kidney, lung, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tissues. In mouse, Cpetr1 is expressed in the early embryo, appears to be developmentally upregulated during gestation, and is present in adult tissues. Our results suggest a role for CPE-R in internal organ development and function during pre- and postnatal life.",M1
9858827,"Identification of the WBSCR9 gene, encoding a novel transcriptional regulator, in the Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion at 7q11.23.We have identified a novel gene (WBSCR9) within the common Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) deletion by interspecies sequence conservation. The WBSCR9 gene encodes a roughly 7-kb transcript with an open reading frame of 1483 amino acids and a predicted protein product size of 170.8 kDa. WBSCR9 is comprised of at least 20 exons extending over 60 kb. The transcript is expressed ubiquitously throughout development and is subject to alternative splicing. Functional motifs identified by sequence homology searches include a bromodomain; a PHD, or C4HC3, finger; several putative nuclear localization signals; four nuclear receptor binding motifs; a polyglutamate stretch and two PEST sequences. Bromodomains, PHD motifs and nuclear receptor binding motifs are cardinal features of proteins that are involved in chromatin remodeling and modulation of transcription. Haploinsufficiency for WBSCR9 gene products may contribute to the complex phenotype of WBS by interacting with tissue-specific regulatory factors during development.",M1
9466987,"A duplicated gene in the breakpoint regions of the 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion encodes the initiator binding protein TFII-I and BAP-135, a phosphorylation target of BTK.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with multisystemic manifestations caused by heterozygosity for a partial deletion of chromosome band 7q11.23. The breakpoints cluster within regions located approximately 1 cM either side of the elastin (ELN) locus. We have characterized a duplicated region near the common deletion breakpoints, which includes a transcribed gene. The centromeric (C) and telomeric (T) copies are almost identical in the duplicated 3[prime] portions but diverge at their 5[prime]-ends. C-specific 4.3 kb mRNA and T-specific 5.4 kb mRNA are widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues. The telomeric gene gives rise to several alternatively spliced forms and is deleted in all WBS individuals who have documented ELN deletions. Database searches revealed that this gene encodes BAP-135, a protein phosphorylated by Bruton's tyrosine kinase in B cells, as well as the multifunctional transcription factor TFII-I, hence the gene name GTF2I. The centromeric gene is not deleted in WBS and appears to be a partially truncated expressed pseudogene with no protein product (gene name GTF2IP1). Both loci map to different genomic clone contigs that also contain other deleted and non-deleted loci. A probe from the shared region recognizes a &gt;3 Mb Not I junction fragment that is unique to individuals with the WBS deletion. Therefore, the duplicated region containing GTF2I and GTF2IP1 respectively is located close to the deletion breakpoints and may predispose to unequal meiotic recombination between chromosome 7 homologs and/or to intrachromosomal rearrangements. Hemizygosity for GTF2I may also contribute to the WBS phenotype.",M1

GTF2I represents the telomeric and functional copy of a duplicated gene flanking the 2-Mb Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) common deletion at 7q11.23. GTF2I is deleted in WBS, while a truncated centromeric pseudogene (GTF2IP1) is not deleted.

Gtf2i is 87.7% identical to GTF2I at the nucleotide and 97% at the amino acid level and generates several alternatively spliced transcripts. The gene is widely expressed in adult tissues and equally in all areas of the brain. Gtf2i transcript is detectable in ES cells by RT-PCR and on Northern blots of tissues from 7-dpc embryos.

Measurements revealed systolic hypertension in 46.5% of 142 patients, diastolic hypertension occurred in 36.6% (i.e. actual pressure &gt; 95 percentile). According to the ambulatory data 42.2% of 45 patients had hypertension (mean arterial pressure &gt; normal + 2SD). The nocturnal decline of the blood pressure was normal in hypertensive patients but reduced in normotensives (p &lt; 0.01 vs normals). Males were more often hypertensive than females (46% vs 38%). Hypertensives had a higher body mass index than normotensives (19.5 vs 16.6 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.05). In normo- and hypertensive WBS patients mean heart rates were elevated during day- and nighttime (p &lt; 0.02 vs normals) the latter due to a reduced nocturnal decline. The prevalence of hypertension in WBS patients amounts to about 40%, thus being four- to eight-fold in comparison to healthy young adults or children. The diurnal blood pressure pattern and the elevated heart rates indicate that an increased arterial stiffness due to the vascular disease in the WBS and augmented sympathetic activity might play a role in the genesis of hypertension. Thus, effective antihypertensive treatment is likely to become difficult. From our experience beta-blocking agents are often successful in hypertensive WBS patients.",M1
9004128,"Williams-Beuren syndrome: phenotypic variability and deletions of chromosomes 7, 11, and 22 in a series of 52 patients.Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and conventional chromosome analysis were performed on a series of 52 patients with classical Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>), suspected WBS, or supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). In the classical WBS group, 22/23 (96%) had a submicroscopic deletion of the elastin locus on chromosome 7, but the remaining patient had a unique interstitial deletion of chromosome 11 (del(11)(q13.5q14.2)). In the suspected WBS group 2/22 (9%) patients had elastin deletions but a third patient had a complex karyotype including a ring chromosome 22 with a deletion of the long arm (r(22)(p11--&gt;q13)). In the SVAS group, 1/7 (14%) had an elastin gene deletion, despite having normal development and minimal signs of WBS. Overall, some patients with submicroscopic elastin deletions have fewer features of Williams-Beuren syndrome than those with other cytogenetic abnormalities. These results, therefore, emphasise the importance of a combined conventional and molecular cytogenetic approach to diagnosis and suggest that the degree to which submicroscopic deletions of chromosome 7 extend beyond the elastin locus may explain some of the phenotypic variability found in Williams-Beuren syndrome.",M1
8968740,"Unequal interchromosomal rearrangements may result in elastin gene deletions causing the Williams-Beuren syndrome.Williams-Beuren syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is generally the consequence of an interstitial microdeletion at 7q11.23, which includes the elastin gene, thus causing hemizygosity at the elastin gene locus. The origin of the deletion has been reported by many authors to be maternal in approximately 60% and paternal in 40% of cases. Segregation analysis of grandparental markers flanking the microdeletion region in WBS patients and their parents indicated that in the majority of cases a recombination between grandmaternal and grandpaternal chromosomes 7 at the site of the deletion had occurred during meiosis in the parent from whom the deleted chromosome stemmed. Thus, the majority of deletions were considered a consequence of unequal crossing-over between homologous chromosomes 7 (interchromosomal rearrangement) while in the remaining cases an intrachromosomal recombination (between the chromatids of one chromosome 7) may have occurred. These results suggest that the majority of interstitial deletions of the elastin gene region occur during meiosis, due to unbalanced recombination while a minority could occur before or during meiosis probably due to intrachromosomal rearrangements. The recurrence risk of the interchromosomal rearrangements for sibs of a proband with non-affected parents must be negligible, which fits well with the observation of sporadic occurrence of almost all cases of WBS.",M1

The extent of these deletions has, however, not been well characterized. Thirty-five deletion patients were tested for all polymorphic markers in the 7q11.2 region bounding ELN to define the extent of deletions associated with WBS. With only one exception, ELN, D7S1870, and one copy of the D7S489 locus (D7S489U) were always included in the deletions. One patient showed lack of maternal inheritance at D7S1870 and not at ELN or D7S489U. A product corresponding to D7S489U was amplified from YAC 743G6 and from the P1 clone RMC07P008, thereby localizing both to within the common deletion. The boundary of the deleted region on the proximal (centromeric) side is D7S653 and on the distal side is D7S675, neither of which were ever included in the deletion. One locus, D7S489L, was variably deleted in patients, indicating a minimum of two common breakpoints on the proximal side. At least one additional repeat amplified by D7S489 (D7S489M) was localized to a YAC contig mapping distal to the common deletion. The D7S489 sequence is highly homologous to several cDNA clones in the GenBank database and contains an Alu sequence. It is possible that this andsolidusor other repetitive sequences in this region could play a role in the mechanism of deletion.",M1

In nine patients a duplicated kidney was found. A decreased creatinine clearance (two patients), recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections (four patients), and hypertension were uncommon. Nephrocalcinosis was not found in our patients. Our data demonstrate that the risk of a structural abnormality of the kidneys and the urinary tract is increased 12- to 36-fold in Williams-Beuren syndrome compared to the normal population.

Ocular findings can be irisabnormalities (stellate, pattern), tortuositas vasorum and, though not essential for diagnosis, strabismus is commonly found. Three cases of WBS with convergent squint which underwent surgical treatment are presented. Biopsy and histological studies were performed in two cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Strabismus onset was diagnosed before the second year of life in all three. Pre-operative esotropia (ET) was 45, 40 and 62 delta. Age at operation was respectively 52,67 and 87 months. Surgical treatment consisted in recess-resect procedures on horizontal muscles. Biopsy was performed in two cases. RESULTS: Three months after surgery, angular measurements were respectively: exotropia (XT) 6 delta, ET 2 delta, ET 10 delta. Anatomopathological findings showed normal tendon tissue. DISCUSSION: No particular motility disturbances or pattern have been found in our patients. Amount of surgery has been chosen according to routine. Amblyopia treatment could be performed as usual. Treatment in our patients with WBS has been similar to ordinary cases of strabismus. Medium-term results do not differ from other squinting patients treated with similar procedures.",M1

The aim of our study was to examine the stability of the development of nonverbal reasoning abilities over a period of 2 years using two methods. We studied 18 children with WBS (9 girls, 9 boys) with a mean age of 6.6 years (range: 4.4-10.6 yr) at year one (T1), and approximately two years later (T2) at the average age of 8.6 years (range: 5.11-12.7 yr). The Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMM) and the Draw A Person Test were administered. The results show that the IQs resulting from the Draw A Person Test were stable over the 2-year period (T1: mean IQ = 63.5, T2: mean IQ = 65, t = 0.63), and display a significant correlation between the two methods (r = 0.547, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the correlation between the two tests (CMM and Draw A Person Test) at the second assessment is high and significant (r = 0.56, P = 0.01). The mean IQs at T2 can be classified as mild mental retardation. A notable result is the significant decrease of the IQs according to the CMM (T1: mean IQ = 77, T2: mean IQ = 68, t = 2.69, P = 0.01).

On the different subscales of the Dutch adaptation of the Parent Temperament Questionnaire no statistically significant differences between the WBS and the control group were noted. An easier temperament was noted in the control group, and we also found greater intensity, less persistence and lower treshold in WBS subjects.

Histologic studies of WBS show nesidioblastosis of the pancreas, adrenocortical cytomegaly, and persistent metanephric blastema of the kidney. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the human 11p15.5 region is the locus of abnormality in WBS. Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-2) frequently has been considered a candidate gene, and expression of IGF-2 is known to be significantly delayed in fetal skeletal muscle of double-muscle (DM) cattle. Other candidate genes recently have been proposed for WBS. A number of recessive alleles in the bovine myostatin gene (GDF8, mapped to bovine chromosome 2 and apparently orthologous to the human 2q22 region) have been shown to be responsible for DM. Recently the first human case of deficient GDF8 function has been reported, confirming the importance of this gene. Bovine IGF-2 has been sequenced and localized to chromosome 25. The primary purpose of this study was to compare and contrast histologic findings in DM and WBS. Immunohistochemical staining confirms changes similar to nesidioblastosis in the pancreas. Other dysplastic changes of a cystic nature are seen in the adrenal. The renal histology of DM fetuses did not appear significantly different than controls.",M2
15150778,"CDKN1C mutation in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome patients reduces RNA splicing efficiency and identifies a splicing enhancer.Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a human overgrowth disorder that is accompanied by an increased risk of embryonal tumors and is associated with dsyregulation of the imprinting of genes in chromosome 11p15.5. Maternally inherited mutations in the imprinted CDKN1C gene are known to be associated with WBS. We have identified a novel mutation in several members of a large family affected by WBS. The mutation is a G --&gt; T change in a run of seven G's near the 5' splice site of intron 3. All obligate carriers and affected individuals carry the mutation, and in each affected case, the allele was inherited maternally, strongly suggesting a role in causing WBS. The mutation is located in a poly-G tract in the intron; intronic G-rich sequences in other genes have been shown to have a role in promoting splicing. In transfected 293HEK cells, we found that the G --&gt; T mutation reduced splicing efficiency. Mutation of all seven G's in the poly-G tract further reduced splicing efficiency, supporting a role for the G-tract as a splicing enhancer. The fibroblasts of one affected patient showed a similar reduction in splicing efficiency. Maternal monoallelic expression of CDKN1C was verified in this patient cell line. However, the total amount of spliced message was not reduced by the mutation in spite of the reduced efficiency of splicing. We discuss the possible role of the splicing defect in the pathogenesis of WBS in this pedigree.",M2
11807901,"Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome: further prenatal characterization of the condition.We describe three unrelated cases of Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). Two of them were diagnosed postnatally while the third was detected during pregnancy that resulted in elective termination. Amniotic karyotypes were normal in all. PCR amplification of polymorphic loci mapping to 11p15.5 region documented partial trisomy of 11p15.5 due to paternal translocation in one, and segmental and mosaic segmental unipaternal disomy (UPD) in the second and third cases, respectively. Based on findings documented in these cases and the literature, we tabulated the anomalies that might be detected prenatally by ultrasound and that may suggest the syndrome. Constant findings included fetal overgrowth, polyhydramios, enlarged placenta, and specifically a distended abdomen. As most described signs developed after 22 weeks of gestation, a careful follow-up should be carried on until late stages of pregnancy. An amniotic karyotype might not detect subtle chromosomal rearrangements. We therefore recommend utilizing PCR of polymorphic loci on 11p15.5, in addition to conventional cytogenetic analysis of the fetus and both parents to detect possible maternal deletions or inversions, paternal duplications, and UPD that may account for the largest subset of sporadic WBS reaching 25% of cases. An early diagnosis of WBS is important for counseling the parents concerning potential risk for developing embryonic tumors, selection of the mode of delivery due to potential adrenal cysts that might bleed during labor, and prevention of neonatal hypoglycemia.",M2
11746041,"Linkage study in families with posterior helical ear pits and Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.The Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is defined by a group of anomalies, including macrosomia, macroglossia, omphalocele, and ear creases. Several minor anomalies have also been reported in the syndrome, including posterior helical ear pits (PHEP). Two independent linkage studies of pedigrees with autosomal dominant inheritance have shown linkage of WBS to 11p15.5 markers. Further confirming the location of WBS to this location is the finding of 11p15.5 duplications and translocations, as well as uniparental disomy for a small area of 11p15.5. In this study, members of previously described families exhibiting autosomal dominant inheritance of the PHEP phenotype were genotyped for three markers in the 11p15.5 region. These three markers were in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF2), insulin (INS), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) region. The data were examined by linkage analysis using the same genetic model used previously to demonstrate linkage of WBS to markers on chromosome 11p15.5: an autosomal dominant model with a penetrance of 0.90 and a gene frequency of 0.001. In one large pedigree, linkage analysis of the 11p15.5 markers excluded the PHEP phenotype from the IGF2, INS, and TH region. In the four other pedigrees examined, the marker loci were not sufficiently informative or the pedigrees did not provide sufficient power to exclude linkage from this region. The strongest evidence against linkage of the PHEP phenotype to 11p15.5 was evident by inspection of the segregation of the haplotypes of the markers in the pedigrees. In two informative pedigrees, relatives with the PHEP phenotype did not share the same haplotype of markers identical by descent. Our results show that the PHEP phenotype is not linked to chromosome 11p15.5 in the informative families tested. In the families examined, there are not enough individuals with WBS to determine if WBS was linked to 11p15.5 in these families. Although locus heterogeneity has not been demonstrated in WBS, it is possible that a second WBS locus exists and that the PHEP phenotype in these families is linked to a second WBS locus. Alternatively, the PHEP phenotype may occur independently of WBS so that the association of WBS and PHEP in our pedigrees may, in fact, represent causal heterogeneity.",M2
10797434,"Proportion of cells with paternal 11p15 uniparental disomy correlates with organ enlargement in Wiedemann-beckwith syndrome. Genetic mosaicism  describes the presence of two or more populations of cells within a single individual that differ in their genomic constitution. Although the occurrence of asymmetric overgrowth in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) suggests that mosaicism has some role in the WBS phenotype, no direct evidence for this has been published. WBS is a congenital overgrowth syndrome with variable phenotype linked to the imprinted gene cluster on chromosome region 11p15. We have performed a molecular survey of multiple organs and tissues in a case of WBS with a high degree of mosaic paternal 11p15 uniparental disomy (UPD). The organs most severely affected were those with the highest percentage of cells with UPD. In particular there was a striking difference in the degree of mosaicism for 11p15 UPD between the extremely enlarged left adrenal and non-enlarged right adrenal gland. This result indicates that the proportion of paternal 11p15 UPD cells correlates with the tissue phenotype of WBS. Our results suggest that high proportions of abnormal cells result from a combination of stochastic events and cell selection. Mosaicism may explain the variable phenotypes including hemihyperplasia and predisposition to childhood cancers in WBS patients.",M2

About 20% of patients with sporadic WBS have paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of 11p. Mitotic recombination at the 11p region has been suggested to be responsible for the somatic mosaicism in these patients. Our current study concerning sporadic WBS patients demonstrated six patients with mosaic isodisomy restricted to part of 11p and one patient with mosaic paternal uniparental disomy for the whole chromosome 11. Apparently the clinical findings for this patient did not differ from data reported for other WBS patients. This case makes it unlikely that the proximal short arm and the long arm of chromosome 11 contain imprinted genes with a phenotype recognizable prenatally or in infancy, and gives some support to the hypothesis that non-mosaic UPD-11 is prenatally lethal.",M2

Trisomy 11p15 was demonstrated using molecular probes in interphase nuclei of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded placenta from a stillborn fetus and in peripheral blood lymphocytes from two liveborn female relatives. Clinical examination showed nonimmune hydrops and placentomegaly in two siblings and multiple phenotypic abnormalities consistent with WBS in the two other relatives. Paternal karyotype of the stillborn infants demonstrated a reciprocal translocation (46,XY,t(10;11) (q26;p15)) explaining the origin of the extra 11p15 material. This study illustrates the advantages of FISH for interphase analysis of chromosome aberrations otherwise not detected even by conventional cytogenetic analysis and documents that nonimmune hydrops associated with placentomegaly may be the presenting features in familial WBS.",M2

7541608,"Longitudinal observations on 15 children with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.We conducted a follow-up study on 15 patients with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) to further clarify major and minor diagnostic clinical characteristics and longterm expectations for growth and development. We found patients with WBS tended to have polyhydramnios with large placentas which were almost twice normal placental weight. The large fetal size and polyhydramnios often resulted in early delivery with occasional perinatal mortality (three cases). Increased placental size, with associated polyhydramnios resulting in excessive umbilical cord length, may be useful in suspecting WBS prior to delivery, thereby facilitating perinatal management. The presence of abdominal wall defects and/or macroglossia may help to confirm the diagnosis. At birth, patients were almost 2 standard deviations above the expected mean for gestational age, length, and weight. This trend continued through early childhood and then excessive size became less dramatic with increasing age. We detected no cytogenetic variations in nine patients who had studies done and, to date, no tumors have been detected other than a gastric teratoma that was evident in one infant at birth. Longitudinally, the children have not had an unusual incidence of medical problems, and long-term ultrasound monitoring was not burdensome to the families. In comparison, mental and social development to unaffected siblings and cousins appeared normal.",M2
7625447,"Non-random X chromosome inactivation in an affected twin in a monozygotic twin pair discordant for Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a syndrome including exomphalos, macroglossia, and generalized overgrowth. The locus has been assigned to 11p15.5, and genomic imprinting may play a part in the expression of one or more genes involved. Most cases are sporadic. An excess of female monozygotic twins discordant for WBS have been reported, and it has been proposed that this excess could be related to the process of X chromosome inactivation. We have therefore studied X chromosome inactivation in 13-year-old monozygotic twin girls who were discordant for WBS. In addition, both twins had Tourette syndrome. The twins were monochorionic and therefore the result of a late twinning process. This has also been the case in previously reported discordant twin pairs with information on placentation. X chromosome inactivation was determined in DNA from peripheral blood cells by PCR analysis at the androgen receptor locus. The affected twin had a completely skewed X inactivation, where the paternal allele was on the active X chromosome in all cells. The unaffected twin had a moderately skewed X inactivation in the same direction, whereas the mother had a random pattern. Further studies are necessary to establish a possible association between the expression of WBS and X chromosome inactivation.",M2

We confirm that most patients with WBS do well and that their clinical abnormalities become less apparent with age.

7909196,"Excess functional copy of allele at chromosomal region 11p15 may cause Wiedemann-Beckwith (EMG) syndrome.Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is a genetic disorder with overgrowth and predisposition to Wilms' tumor. The putative locus of the gene responsible for this syndrome is assigned to chromosome region 11p15.5, and genomic imprinting in this region has been proposed: the paternally derived gene(s) at 11p15.5 is selectively expressed, while the maternally transmitted gene(s) is inactive. We examined 18 patients for the parental origin of their 11p15 regions. DNA polymorphism analyses using 6 loci on chromosome 11 showed that 2 patients with duplications of 11p15 regions from their respective fathers and one from the mother, indicating the transmission of an excessive paternal gene at 11p15 to each patient. Our results, together with the previous findings in karyotypically normal or abnormal patients and in overgrowth mouse experiments, are consistent with imprinting hypothesis that overexpression of paternally derived gene(s) at 11p15.5, probably the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene, may cause the phenotype. Total constitutional uniparental paternal disomy (UPD) or segmental UPD for the 6 loci examined of chromosome 11 was not observed in our 12 sporadic patients. In order to explain completely the inheritance of this syndrome in patients with various chromosomal constitutions, we propose an alternative imprinting mechanism involving the other locus that may be paternally imprinted and may suppress the expression of this gene.",M2
8069648,"Somatic mosaicism for partial paternal isodisomy in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome: a post-fertilization event.Genomic imprinting has been implicated in the aetiology of an overgrowth cancer-prone syndrome, the Wiedemann-Beck-with syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). We have demonstrated uniparental disomy (UPD) for paternal chromosome 11p markers in 5 out of 25 sporadic cases (20%). Delineation of the extent of the disomy region may help in understanding the mechanism and the stage, meiotic or mitotic, of disomy formation in this disease and in associated tumours. Our current studies in WBS patients with seventeen 11p and one 11q markers reveal paternal isodisomy, not heterodisomy, in the five cases. For one case we demonstrate unambiguously that partial isodisomy for 11p and somatic mosaicism for UPD resulted from a post-fertilization event. The restriction of isodisomy to part of 11p in another case, and somatic mosaicism for UPD in three other cases, suggest a mitotic recombinational event that must have occurred after fertilization. Mosaic phenotypes reflect the timing of their origin and the fate of the cells involved, as well as the cell-specific pattern of imprinting. Somatic mosaicism for UPD in four cases may thus explain the incomplete forms of WBS. The association of hemihypertrophy in sporadic WBS and even some cases of isolated hemihypertrophy. This is in agreement with a recent report of paternal isodisomy for 11p markers in a patient with hemihypertrophy, Wilms' tumour and adrenocortical carcinoma. Moreover, the risk of developing a tumour seems higher (50%) for patients with paternal 11p UPD than for WBS patients in general (7.5%).",M2
1356785,"Molecular analysis of patients with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. II. Paternally derived disomies of chromosome 11.In Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) a putative disease gene resides at the tip of the short arm of chromosome 11 in the region of the insulin growth like factor II (IGF-II) gene. Whilst changes in gene dosage in this area do not appear to be common in the syndrome, in familial cases the lesion appears to be dominant only when inherited through the female line. We undertook to examine the parental origin of the copies of chromosome 11 in a large group of WBS patients using a series of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) on 11p, and report here that in one sporadic case of WBS out of 14 both copies of chromosome 11 are derived from the father and are present in a normal dosage. This suggests that at least one mode of expression of the lesion is modified by genomic imprinting.",M2
1356784,"Molecular analysis of patients with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. I. Gene dosage on the short arm of chromosome 11.Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) is characterised by a specific group of congenital malformations associated with an increased concurrent risk for development of a defined group of childhood neoplasms. The mode of inheritance is complex, but recently compiled family data suggest that it is an autosomal dominant trait of varying expression. It has previously been suggested that major rearrangements on the short arm of chromosome 11 may be involved in the aetiology of the disease, particularly in the region of the insulin like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene (11p15.5). This gene is thought to be parentally imprinted in the mouse and it has been suggested that in the human, duplication of the non-imprinted locus in WBS patient might lead to diploid expression of the gene and consequent general hyperplasia. This model predicts that there should be both frequent and parental origin specific duplication of the IGF-II gene in the patients. It was the aim of this study to examine the IGF-II locus and its surrounding chromosomal environment for such lesions in a large number of WBS patients. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for four linked markers on 11p and genomic clones internal to the IGF-II locus we could find no evidence of alteration or amplification of this area in any of the 11 patients investigated. In one patient who developed a Wilms tumour we could find no evidence for loss of any material on the short arm of chromosome 11 as reported previously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

A fetus, sib of the affected baby, had the same inversion and ultrasound scan showed exomphalos. The maternal grandmother is clinically and cytogenetically normal.

1609846,"Monozygotic twinning and Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.Monozygotic (MZ) twinning occurs with relatively high frequency in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>). Ten sets of MZ twins with WBS have been reported. Nine of these have been female and in each case the twins were discordant for the WBS phenotype. The tenth set was male. They were concordant for WBS and both had a duplication of chromosome 15 which they shared in common with their phenotypically normal mother. The WBS gene has been assigned to the locus 11p15 and there appear to be several different genetic mechanisms involving this locus which all give rise to WBS. An imprinting effect for the WBS gene has been proposed because of the transmission of the gene preferentially through the maternal line in some large pedigrees. We describe two further sets of female MZ twins with WBS. One pair is concordant and one discordant for the condition. The possible genetic mechanisms involved in the expression of WBS are discussed, with particular reference to twinning, genomic imprinting and X-inactivation which is thought to be associated with the occurrence of MZ twinning in females.",M2

The relevant physical findings were a characteristic face, non increased mean height and weight, normal head circumference, defective abdominal wall, a predominance of the upper segment, and tibial bowing. Mental retardation was documented in 5 cases but in only 1 it was related to hypoglycemia. The 32 cases karyotyped were normal. Since neonatal hypoglycemia is frequent (34.3% in our series) and potentially deleterious for the CNS we propose to monitor the glycemia every 6 h during the first 3 days in WBS newborns in order to correct glycemia below of 2.6 mmol/l (46.8 mg/dl) according to recent studies.

We report on a newborn infant with WBS and a congenital teratoma of the stomach. This is the sole report of any teratoma being associated with WBS and also the first report of a tumor present at birth and visible prenatally in WBS. At birth this infant boy had the diagnostic findings of WBS with macroglossia, ear lobule creases and pits, nevus flammeus, and omphalocele, and an abdominal mass. Abnormalities were detected prenatally when ultrasound examination showed placental overgrowth, polyhydramnios, omphalocele, and posterior abdominal calcifications. Resection of the mass and partial gastrectomy were performed at age 10 days; histologic study showed an immature grade-II teratoma containing a mixture of mature and immature tissues from all germ layers. Results of cytogenetic studies of blood and teratoma were normal (46,XY). This congenital gastric teratoma in a newborn boy with classical WBS may represent either a tumor or an included twin.

Renal sonography done after the macroglossia developed showed large kidneys in both.

The clinical evolution of these infants suggests that some WBS manifestations may have their onset postnatally in some cases.

The condition occurred in sibs born to carrier women and in children born to affected mothers. Presumptive carrier women were examined for microsigns of WBS in an attempt to determine whether extreme variability of the disorder, rather than an unaffected carrier state, was present. No minor stigmata of the WBS could be found in the presumptive carriers. Our study supports a previous hypothesis that in some families the WBS can be transmitted in a 2-step process involving first an unstable premutation and then a  telomutation.  Because only females appear to be transmitters of the telomutation, an ovum-mediated sex-associated factor may be involved in the process of telomutation.",M2
2539717,"Familial Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome and a second Wilms tumor locus both map to 11p15.5.Wilms tumor of the kidney occurs with increased frequency in association with two clinically and cytogenetically distinct congenital syndromes, the Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (<e>WBS</e>) and the triad of aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR). Constitutional deletions in the latter situation and similar alterations in sporadic Wilms tumors have implicated the chromosomal 11p13 region in neoplastic development. In contrast, some sporadic cases of WBS have been reported to have a constitutional duplication of chromosome 11p15. In order to resolve this seeming paradox, we have analyzed a family segregating WBS for linkage to DNA markers mapped to chromosome 11p. Consonant with the cytogenetic alterations in sporadic WBS cases, we obtained evidence for tight linkage of the mutation causing the syndrome to markers located at 11p15.5. Also consistent with this localization, we identified a subset of Wilms tumors, not associated with WBS, which have attained somatic homozygosity through mitotic recombination, with the smallest shared region of overlap being distal to the beta-globin complex at 11p15.5. These data provide evidence that familial WBS likely results from a defect at the same genetic locus as does its sporadic counterpart. Further, the data suggest there is another locus, distinct from that involved in the WAGR syndrome, which plays a role in the association of Wilms tumor with WBS.",M2

Inversion of chromosome #9--one of the heterochromatin variants associated with elevated chromosomal instability, increased congenital abnormalities, and cancer proneness--may have been causally connected with a genetic imbalance resulting in the de novo deletion of 11p11.
