20520588,"Public health surveillance using emergency medical service logs - U.S.--Mexico land border, El Paso, Texas, 2009.In 2008, approximately 358 million travelers entered the United States, of whom 206 million arrived via land ports of entry (POEs) on the U.S.--Mexico border. Effective response to infectious diseases of public health importance among travelers requires timely identification and reporting to state and federal health authorities. Currently, notifications are made primarily by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers to CDC quarantine stations. However, CBP personnel have competing priorities and limited public health training.To evaluate the utility of monitoring emergency medical service (<e>EMS</e>) dispatch and response logs for ill travelers with symptoms or signs suggestive of infectious diseases, CDC screened medical records of patients transported by EMS during 2009 from the four POEs in El Paso, Texas. The screening was conducted using commercial software that monitors EMS logs and sends alerts in real time based on preestablished criteria (i.e., records containing keywords suggesting infectious diseases). Records that met the criteria were forwarded to El Paso Quarantine Station personnel and reviewed within 24 hours. If a reportable infectious disease was suspected, the final diagnosis was requested from the receiving hospital.This report summarizes the results of the evaluation, which found that, of 50,779 EMS responses in the city of El Paso, 455 (0.9%) records met alert criteria, 86 (0.2%) needed diagnostic confirmation, and nine (&lt;0.1%) were for reportable infectious diseases. Monitoring EMS logs can enhance detection of travelers with serious infections at POEs but requires additional screening and follow-up by CDC.",M1

20467997,"Canadian operational and emotional prehospital readiness for a tactical violence event.Providing prehospital care poses unique risks. Paramedics are essentially the only medical personnel who are routinely at the scene of violent episodes, and they are more likely to be assaulted than are other prehospital personnel. In addition to individual acts of violence, emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) providers now need to cope with tactical violence, defined as the deployment of extreme violence in a non-random fashion to achieve tactical or strategic goals. This study reviewed two topics; the readiness of EMS crews for violence in their environment and the impact of violence on the EMS crew member. This latter also evaluated the access and effectiveness of emotional support available to caregivers exposed to violent episodes. The results of the survey indicate a significant lack of preparedness for situations involving tactical violence. A total of 89% of respondents either had never had such training or had been trained more than one year ago. Thirty-six percent of respondents had never engaged in a field exercise with other responding agencies, and 4.5% of respondents were not aware of who would be in charge in such an event. In addition, this study indicates that EMS crews are exposed to events with significant emotional impacts without access to appropriate training and adequate support.",M1
20467994,"Where there are no emergency medical services-prehospital care for the injured in Mumbai, India.INTRODUCTION: In a populous city like Mumbai, which lacks an organized prehospital emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system, there exists an informal network through which victims arrive at the trauma center. This baseline study describes the prehospital care and transportation that currently is available in Mumbai. METHODS: A prospective trauma database was created by interviewing 170 randomly selected patients from a total of 454 admitted over a two-month period (July-August 2005) at a Level-I, urban, trauma center. RESULTS: The injured victim in Mumbai usually is rescued by a good Samaritan passer-by (43.5%) and contrary to popular belief, helped by the police (89.7%). Almost immediately after rescue, the victim begins transport to the hospital. No one waits for the EMS ambulance to arrive, as there is none. A taxi cab is the most popular substitute for the ambulance (39.3%). The trauma patient in India usually is a young man in his late-twenties, from a lower socioeconomic class. He mostly finds himself in a government hospital, as private hospitals are reluctant to provide trauma care to the seriously injured. The injured who do receive prehospital care receive inadequate and inappropriate care due to the high cost of consumables in resuscitation, and in part due to the providers' lack of training in emergency care. Those who were more likely to receive prehospital care suffered from road traffic injuries (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3) and those transported by government ambulances (OR = 10.83), as compared to railway accident victims (OR = 0 .41) and those who came by taxi (OR = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, as a result of not having an EMS system, prehospital care is a citizen responsibility using societal networks. It is easy to eliminate this system and shift the responsibility to the state. The moot point is whether the state-funded EMS system will be robust enough in a resource-poor setting in which public hospitals are poorly funded. Considering the high funding cost of EMS systems in developed countries and the insufficient evidence that prehospital field interventions by the EMS actually have improved outcomes, Mumbai must proceed with caution when implementing advanced EMS systems into its congested urban traffic. Similar cities, such as Mexico City and Jakarta, have had limited success with implementing EMS systems. Perhaps reinforcing the existing network of informal providers of taxi drivers and police and with training, funding quick transport with taxes on roads and automobile fuels and regulating the private ambulance providers, could be more cost-effective in a culture in which sharing and helping others is not just desirable, but is necessary for overall economic survival.",M1

20399377,"The ABCs of TBI. Evidence-based guidelines for adult traumatic brain injury care.The images of Olympic athlete Nodar Kumaritasvili flying off his luge and contacting a fixed steel beam at the recent Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, were shocking. But the resultant injuries and death of the young athlete were not surprising to <e>EMS</e> personnel who witnessed the incident, because training and experience with similar mechanisms of injury intuitively teach us that these types of patients are susceptible to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Worldwide, TBI is the leading injury cause of death and permanent disability. In the U.S. alone, 1.4 million cases of TBI present to emergency services every year. Many more cases go unreported and untreated. These TBIs lead to 235,000 hospitalizations and, ultimately, 50,000 deaths.(1) For instance, blunt trauma alone kills 1% of those affected, but when a TBI is also involved, the mortality rate increases to 30%.(2) Some 50% of those who die from TBI do so within the first two hours of injury, making emergent prehospital intervention critical.(3) Preventing secondary injury by proper prehospital management can save brain function and lives.",M1
20399376,"Critical thinking a new approach to patient care.As <e>EMS</e> responders, we're challenged with complex patient care situations, and we often make decisions using past experiences, protocols and medical consultation to guide us through treatment  mazes.  Using our natural problem-solving process, we tend to see a problem and think about similar past experiences, which we believe will help us implement a workable solution to the problem.(1,2,3) As we strive toward patient care excellence, however, we need to also look for the best solution for our patient care needs. Research continues to reveal that EMS responders may benefit from increasing their practice of critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making in initial and continuing education.(4-13) Studies are finding that increased practice and exposure to triage, airway management and medication administration decision-making will allow us to achieve an increased quality of patient care.(7,14-22) Research has also found many reasons for patient care deficiencies, but a common theme is that EMS students and providers may not be getting enough practice or exposure to thinking  outside of the box  in difficult, critical-thinking scenarios.(12,14,18,20,21,23-25) This lack of exposure is why EMS educators should continue to challenge students with skills practice and competency assessments. Even with minimal time and practice in the classroom and clinical settings, EMS educators and instructors should infuse the curriculum with complex scenarios and problems to stimulate students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills.(26-30) This can be accomplished by using patient simulation, team-based thinking scenarios, realistic scenarios with variable outcomes and student-group-facilitated presentations.(12) All of these combined will have a greater meaning to students as they navigate through the many requirements to achieve competence and real-life experience in the patient care setting.(31) In response to this need, EMS educational materials are placing more emphasis on critical thinking and encouraging educators to challenge students to think through complex patient care situations.(28,32,33) THOUGHT PROCESS &amp; DECISION-MAKING MODELS: These critical thinking and problem solving skills can't be taught by using only local protocols as gospel in the classroom, nor should we be teaching by a  cookbook  methodology alone.(12) Problem solving and decision-making processes in the public safety professions have developed and evolved over many years, allowing researchers to explore the thought processes decision-makers use when confronted with real-life situations.(1,2,34,35).",M1
20394876,"Survival after application of automatic external defibrillators before arrival of the emergency medical system: evaluation in the resuscitation outcomes consortium population of 21 million.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of contemporary automatic external defibrillator (AED) use. BACKGROUND: In the PAD (Public Access Defibrillation) trial, survival was doubled by focused training of lay volunteers to use an AED in high-risk public settings. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study of persons with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest before emergency medical system (<e>EMS</e>) arrival at Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) sites between December 2005 and May 2007. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between AED application and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of 13,769 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 4,403 (32.0%) received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation but had no AED applied before EMS arrival, and 289 (2.1%) had an AED applied before EMS arrival. The AED was applied by health care workers (32%), lay volunteers (35%), police (26%), or unknown (7%). Overall survival to hospital discharge was 7%. Survival was 9% (382 of 4,403) with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation but no AED, 24% (69 of 289) with AED application, and 38% (64 of 170) with AED shock delivered. In multivariable analyses adjusting for: 1) age and sex; 2) bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed; 3) location of arrest (public or private); 4) EMS response interval; 5) arrest witnessed; 6) initial shockable or not shockable rhythm; and 7) study site, AED application was associated with greater likelihood of survival (odds ratio: 1.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.23 to 2.50; p &lt; 0.002). Extrapolating this greater survival from the ROC EMS population base (21 million) to the population of the U.S. and Canada (330 million), AED application by bystanders seems to save 474 lives/year. CONCLUSIONS: Application of an AED in communities is associated with nearly a doubling of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These results reinforce the importance of strategically expanding community-based AED programs.",M1
20370778,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in denver, colorado: epidemiology and outcomes.OBJECTIVES: The annual incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) in the United States is approximately 6 per 10,000 population and survival remains low. Relatively little is known about the performance characteristics of a two-tiered emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system split between fire-based basic life support (BLS) dispersed from fixed locations and hospital-based advanced life support (ALS) dispersed from nonfixed locations. The objectives of this study were to describe the incidence of OOHCA in Denver, Colorado, and to define the prevalence of survival with good neurologic function in the context of this particular EMS system. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using standardized abstraction methodology. A two-tiered hospital-based EMS system for the County of Denver and 10 receiving hospitals were studied. Consecutive adult patients who experienced nontraumatic OOHCA from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004, were enrolled. Demographic, prehospital arrest characteristics, treatment data, and survival data using the Utstein template were collected. Good neurologic survival was defined by a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,985 arrests occurred. Of these, 715 (36%) had attempted resuscitation by paramedics and constitute our study sample. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range = 52-78 years), 69% were male, 41% had witnessed arrest, 25% had bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed, and 30% had ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) as their initial rhythm. Of the 715 patients, 545 (76%) were transported to a hospital, 223 (31%) had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 175 (25%) survived to hospital admission, 58 (8%) survived to hospital discharge, and 42 (6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4% to 8%) had a good neurologic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival in Denver, Colorado, is similar to that of other United States communities. This finding provides the basis for future epidemiologic and health services research in the out-of-hospital and ED settings in our community.",M1

20199235,"The longitudinal study of turnover and the cost of turnover in emergency medical services.BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined employee turnover and associated costs in emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>). OBJECTIVE: To quantify the mean annual rate of turnover, total median cost of turnover, and median cost per termination in a diverse sample of EMS agencies. METHODS: A convenience sample of 40 EMS agencies was followed over a six-month period. Internet, telephone, and on-site data-collection methods were used to document terminations, new hires, open positions, and costs associated with turnover. The cost associated with turnover was calculated based on a modified version of the Nursing Turnover Cost Calculation Methodology (NTCCM). The NTCCM identified direct and indirect costs through a series of questions that agency administrators answered monthly during the study period. A previously tested measure of turnover to calculate the mean annual rate of turnover was used. All calculations were weighted by the size of the EMS agency roster. The mean annual rate of turnover, total median cost of turnover, and median cost per termination were determined for three categories of agency staff mix: all-paid staff, mix of paid and volunteer (mixed) staff, and all-volunteer staff. RESULTS: The overall weighted mean annual rate of turnover was 10.7%. This rate varied slightly across agency staffing mix (all-paid = 10.2%, mixed = 12.3%, all-volunteer = 12.4%). Among agencies that experienced turnover (n = 25), the weighted median cost of turnover was $71,613.75, which varied across agency staffing mix (all-paid = $86,452.05, mixed = $9,766.65, and all-volunteer = $0). The weighted median cost per termination was $6,871.51 and varied across agency staffing mix (all-paid = $7,161.38, mixed = $1,409.64, and all-volunteer = $0). CONCLUSIONS: Annual rates of turnover and costs associated with turnover vary widely across types of EMS agencies. The study's mean annual rate of turnover was lower than expected based on information appearing in the news media and EMS trade magazines. Findings provide estimates of two key workforce measures--turnover rates and costs--where previously none have existed. Local EMS directors and policymakers at all levels of government may find the results and study methodology useful toward designing and evaluating programs targeting the EMS workforce.",M1
20199232,"Analysis of emergency medical services activations in Shenandoah National Park from 2003 to 2007.BACKGROUND: Wilderness activities continue to be popular in the United States, but may lead to both direct injuries and exacerbations or complications from chronic diseases. Appropriate response planning requires information on the type and location of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) activations in large outdoor areas with many visitors. OBJECTIVES: To describe EMS calls in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and explore the resultant implications for EMS resources and staging, medical provider training, and potential public health interventions in similar wilderness recreation areas. METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive review was conducted of all park EMS activations in Shenandoah National Park from 2003 to 2007. RESULTS: There were 335 EMS activations within the park over the study period. Both call volume and call rate increased during the study period. There were 197 calls (58.8%) for injuries and 138 (41.2%) for illnesses. Weakness/dizziness was the most frequent illness complaint, and lower extremity injury was the most frequent injury. Those with illnesses were more likely to be seen by EMS at a lodge, tended to be female, and were more likely to require emergency transportation to a hospital. Chronic medical problems were reported for twice as many of the illness patients as for those who were injured. CONCLUSIONS: EMS runs in Shenandoah are increasing and the majority of calls from 2003 to 2007 were for injuries. A notable number of patients with both injuries and illnesses reported chronic medical conditions. These data may be used to help with EMS support availability planning, provider education, and safety planning within the park, and provide baseline data for future public-safety interventions.",M1
20199228,"Out-of-hospital fluid in severe sepsis: effect on early resuscitation in the emergency department.BACKGROUND: Early identification and treatment of patients with severe sepsis improves outcome, yet the role of out-of-hospital intravenous (IV) fluid is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the delivery of out-of-hospital fluid in patients with severe sepsis is associated with reduced time to achievement of goal-oriented resuscitation in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis of a retrospective cohort study in a metropolitan, tertiary care, university-based medical center supported by a two-tiered system of out-of-hospital emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) providers. We studied the association between delivery of out-of-hospital fluid by advanced life support (ALS) providers and the achievement of resuscitation endpoints (central venous pressure [CVP] &gt; or =8 mmHg, mean arterial pressure [MAP] &gt; or =65 mmHg, and central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO(2)] &gt; or =70%) within six hours after triage during early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in the ED. RESULTS: Twenty five (48%) of 52 patients transported by ALS with severe sepsis received out-of-hospital fluid. Data for age, gender, source of sepsis, and presence of comorbidities were similar between patients who did and did not receive out-of-hospital fluid. Patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid had lower out-of-hospital mean (+/- standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (95 +/- 40 mmHg vs. 117 +/- 29 mmHg; p = 0.03) and higher median (interquartile range) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores in the ED (7 [5-8] vs. 4 [4-6]; p = 0.01) than patients not receiving out-of-hospital fluid. Despite greater severity of illness, patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid approached but did not attain a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of achieving MAP &gt; or =65 mmHg within six hours after ED triage (70% vs. 44%, p = 0.09). On average, patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid received twice the fluid volume within one hour after ED triage (1.1 L [1.0-2.0 L] vs. 0.6 L [0.3-1.0 L]; p = 0.01). No difference in achievement of goal CVP (72% vs. 60%; p = 0.6) or goal ScvO(2) (54% vs. 36%; p = 0.25) was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of patients with severe sepsis transported by ALS received out-of-hospital fluid. Patients receiving out-of-hospital IV access and fluids approached but did not attain a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of achieving goal MAP during EGDT. These preliminary findings require additional investigation to evaluate the optimal role of out-of-hospital resuscitation in treating patients with severe sepsis.",M1

20144020,"<e>EMS</e> and managed care: the Los Angeles experience.BACKGROUND: Patients belonging to a managed care organization (MCO) who call 9-1-1 are typically transported to their MCO facility only if it is also the closest emergency department (ED). As past medical records and close follow-up are unavailable at the non-MCO facility, unnecessary workups and/or admissions may result. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and feasibility of preferentially transporting MCO patients to the closest MCO ED rather than the closest ED. METHODS: This was a retrospective review over a 52-month period comparing all patients transported by ambulance to an MCO ED when that destination was not the closest ED (targeted group) with all other transported patients. If the MCO facility was not the closest ED, then the emergency medical services (EMS) provider would be reimbursed an additional fee beyond the routine ambulance charges. The primary outcome measure was the additional ambulance transport time. The secondary outcome measure was mortality within the first 24 hours. RESULTS: There were 15,938 patients transported under this program from July 2000 through December 2004 for whom outcome data were available. Of these, 10,532 (66%) were transported by advanced life support (ALS) ambulance. The mean (+/- standard deviation) transport time to the hospital for all targeted patients transported during the study interval was 10.4 minutes (+/-3.2 minutes) compared with 8.6 minutes (+/-2.1 minutes) for all transported patients (p &lt; 0.001). No patient required ventilatory support in the field. Twelve (0.1%) patients died during the subsequent hospital admission and, after a blinded chart review, none of the deaths were deemed to be preventable or likely to have resulted from additional transport time. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that paramedic transport of MCO patients to the nearest MCO hospital in lieu of the nearest ED is safe and feasible. Given the potential benefits to patient care, this program should be evaluated in other EMS systems.",M1
20144019,"A qualitative study to understand barriers to implementation of national guidelines for prehospital termination of unsuccessful resuscitation efforts.BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association's (AHA's) Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines act as the national standards for termination of resuscitation (TOR) in cases of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, local emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) implementation of these guidelines has been nonuniform. OBJECTIVE: To identify the operational issues within local EMS systems that may serve as barriers or facilitators to full acceptance of national guidelines for prehospital TOR in appropriate circumstances. Methods. We conducted three focus groups at the January 2008 National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) annual meeting. Snowball sampling was used to recruit 19 physicians, two EMS providers, one research director, one nurse, and one medical student attending the conference. Two reviewers analyzed the data in an iterative process to identify recurrent and unifying themes. RESULTS: We identified three distinct stakeholder groups whose current beliefs and practices may influence local implementation of TOR: EMS providers with variations in education and work culture; EMS medical directors with responsibility but little authority; and online medical control physicians who do not communicate effectively with the other groups. Our focus group participants suggested that national organizations, such as the AHA and the American College of Emergency Physicians, may serve a role in overcoming the overarching barriers of communication, standardized educational requirements, and coordination of local services. CONCLUSION: We have identified operational barriers that may impede implementation of TOR guidelines. Three influential stakeholder groups will need to work with national organizations to overcome these local barriers.",M1
20133519,"The emergency medical services safety attitudes questionnaire.To characterize safety culture in emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>), the authors modified a validated safety culture instrument, the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ).

The authors characterized safety culture across 6 domains: safety climate, teamwork climate, perceptions of management, job satisfaction, working conditions, and stress recognition. The feasibility of characterizing safety culture in EMS was evaluated by examining response rate, item missingness, EMS chief administrators' perceptions of the EMS-SAQ, as well as psychometric properties.The results confirm feasibility with a high response rate, acceptable internal consistency, and model fit validity. However, some agencies voiced concerns about respondent burden and the wording and face validity of several EMS-SAQ items. Variation in safety culture scores across EMS agencies within a single geographic area, as well as variation across respondent characteristics, warrants further investigation.",M1
20128704,"Effect of crew size on objective measures of resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.BACKGROUNd: There is no consensus among emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) systems as to the optimal numbers and training of EMS providers who respond to the scene of prehospital cardiac arrests. Increased numbers of providers may improve the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but this has not been studied as part of a comprehensive resuscitation scenario. OBJECTIVE: To compare different all-paramedic crew size configurations on objective measures of patient resuscitation using a high-fidelity human simulator. METHODS: We compared two-, three-, and four-person all-paramedic crew configurations in the effectiveness and timeliness of performing basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) skills during the first 8 minutes of a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Crews were compared to determine differences in no-flow fraction (NFF) as a measure of effectiveness of CPR and time to defibrillation, endotracheal intubation, establishment of intravenous access, and medication administration. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mean NFF among the two-, three-, and four-provider crew configurations (0.32, 0.26, and 0.27, respectively; p = 0.105). More three- and four-person groups completed ALS procedures during the scenario, but there was no significant difference in time to performance of BLS or ALS procedures among the crew size configurations for completed procedures. There was a trend toward lower time to intubation with increasing group size, though this was not significant using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.01 (379, 316, and 263 seconds, respectively; p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: This study found no significant difference in effectiveness of CPR or in time to performance of BLS or ALS procedures among crew size configurations, though there was a trend toward decreased time to intubation with increased crew size. Effectiveness of CPR may be hindered by distractions related to the performance of ALS procedures with increasing group size, particularly with an all-paramedic provider model. We suggest a renewed emphasis on the provision of effective CPR by designated providers independent of any ALS interventions being performed.",M1
20123673,"Predictors of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Prior studies have identified key predictors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but differences exist in the magnitude of these findings. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the strength of associations between OHCA and key factors (event witnessed by a bystander or emergency medical services [<e>EMS</e>], provision of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], initial cardiac rhythm, or the return of spontaneous circulation). We also examined trends in OHCA survival over time. METHODS AND RESULTS: An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane DSR, DARE, ACP Journal Club, and CCTR was conducted (January 1, 1950 to August 21, 2008) for studies reporting OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology in adults. Data were extracted from 79 studies involving 142 740 patients. The pooled survival rate to hospital admission was 23.8% (95% CI, 21.1 to 26.6) and to hospital discharge was 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.4). Stratified by baseline rates, survival to hospital discharge was more likely among those: witnessed by a bystander (6.4% to 13.5%), witnessed by EMS (4.9% to 18.2%), who received bystander CPR (3.9% to 16.1%), were found in ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (14.8% to 23.0%), or achieved return of spontaneous circulation (15.5% to 33.6%). Although 53% (95% CI, 45.0% to 59.9%) of events were witnessed by a bystander, only 32% (95% CI, 26.7% to 37.8%) received bystander CPR. The number needed to treat to save 1 life ranged from 16 to 23 for EMS-witnessed arrests, 17 to 71 for bystander-witnessed, and 24 to 36 for those receiving bystander CPR, depending on baseline survival rates. The aggregate survival rate of OHCA (7.6%) has not significantly changed in almost 3 decades. CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival from OHCA has been stable for almost 30 years, as have the strong associations between key predictors and survival. Because most OHCA events are witnessed, efforts to improve survival should focus on prompt delivery of interventions of known effectiveness by those who witness the event.",M1
20122784,"Scandinavian pre-hospital physician-manned Emergency Medical Services--same concept across borders?BACKGROUND: In Scandinavia, scattered populations and challenging geographical and climatic conditions necessitate highly advanced medical treatment by qualified pre-hospital services. Just like every other part of the health care system, the specialized pre-hospital <e>EMS</e> should aim to optimize its resource use, and critically review as well as continuously assess the quality of its practices. This study aims to provide a comprehensive profile of the pre-hospital, physician-manned EMS in the Scandinavian countries. METHODS: The study was designed as a web-based cross-sectional survey. All specialized pre-hospital, physician-manned services in Scandinavia were invited, and data concerning organization, qualification and medical activity in 2007 were mapped. RESULTS: Of the 41 invited services, 37 responded, which corresponds to a response rate of 90% (Finland 86%, Sweden 83%, Denmark 92%, Norway 94%). Organization and education are basically identical. All services provide advanced life support and have short response intervals. Services take care of a variety of patient groups, and skills are needed not only in procedures, but also in diagnostics, logistics, intensive care, and mass-casualty management. Consistent and detailed medical documentation was often lacking, however. Differences are mainly related to time variables, patient volume, and service area. The Danish and Swedish services have higher volumes of patient care encounters while the Finnish and Norwegian ones provide a wider variety of medical services. CONCLUSIONS: This survey documented several significant similarities among pre-hospital physician-staffed EMS systems in Scandinavia. Although medical data registration is currently under-developed, Scandinavian physician-manned EMS is a feasible arena for future multi-centre research.",M1

20113943,"Lack of emergency medical services documentation is associated with poor patient outcomes: a validation of audit filters for prehospital trauma care.BACKGROUND: Our previous Delphi study identified several audit filters considered sensitive to deviations in prehospital trauma care and potentially useful in conducting performance improvement, a process currently recommended by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. This study validates 2 of those proposed audit filters. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 4,744 trauma patients using the electronic records of the Central Region Trauma registry and Emergency Medical Services (<e>EMS</e>) patient logs for the period January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004. We studied whether requests by on-scene Basic Life Support (BLS) for Advanced Life Support (ALS) assistance or failure by EMS personnel to record basic patient physiology at the scene was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. We performed multivariate analyses, including a propensity score quintile approach, adjusting for differences in case mix and clustering by hospital. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 6.1%. A total of 28.2% (n = 1,337) of EMS records were missing patient scene physiologic data. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients missing 1 or more measures of patient physiology at the scene had increased risk of death (adjusted odds ratio = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.10). In 17.4% (n = 402) of cases BLS requested ALS assistance. Patients for whom BLS requested ALS had a similar risk of death as patients for whom ALS was initially dispatched (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Failure of EMS to document basic measures of scene physiology is associated with increased mortality. This deviation in care can serve as a sensitive audit filter for performance improvement. The need by BLS for ALS assistance was not associated with increased mortality.",M1
20109772,"A comparison of the quality of blood specimens drawn in the field by <e>EMS</e> versus specimens obtained in the emergency department.INTRODUCTION: Emergency Department (ED) acceptance of blood specimens drawn by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff is not a consistent standard of practice across hospitals. The literature does not address acceptance of pre-hospital phlebotomy specimens drawn by EMS staff. The purpose of this study was to compare specimen redraw rates and ED throughput times for specimens drawn by EMS versus ED staff. METHODS: Data was collected on 400 patients regarding phlebotomist type, intravenous (i.v.) site, i.v. angiocatheter size, number of i.v. attempts producing blood specimens, redraw reason, undue blood exposure to phlebotomist, diagnosis, and length of stay. RESULTS: In this study of 400 patients (EMS=200; ED=200), the redraw rate was higher for the ED group (11.5%) than the EMS group (9.5%). The primary reason for redraw in the EMS group was insufficient quantity (52.6%; ED=8.7%, p&lt;.05). The primary reason for redraw in the ED group was hemolysis (52.2%; EMS=31.6%). Median ED throughput time was 17 minutes less for the EMS group (163 minutes) than for ED group (180 minutes). There were no incidences of undue blood exposure in either group. DISCUSSION: Based on no statistically significant differences between the two study groups in redraw rates, a decreased ED patient throughput time, and no undue blood exposure incidences, pre-hospital phlebotomy by EMS in the field and subsequent ED acceptance of samples is a standard of practice that can be implemented.",M1
20109172,"Using genetic algorithms to optimise current and future health planning--the example of ambulance locations.BACKGROUND: Ambulance response time is a crucial factor in patient survival. The number of emergency cases (<e>EMS</e> cases) requiring an ambulance is increasing due to changes in population demographics. This is decreasing ambulance response times to the emergency scene. This paper predicts EMS cases for 5-year intervals from 2020, to 2050 by correlating current EMS cases with demographic factors at the level of the census area and predicted population changes. It then applies a modified grouping genetic algorithm to compare current and future optimal locations and numbers of ambulances. Sets of potential locations were evaluated in terms of the (current and predicted) EMS case distances to those locations. RESULTS: Future EMS demands were predicted to increase by 2030 using the model (R2 = 0.71). The optimal locations of ambulances based on future EMS cases were compared with current locations and with optimal locations modelled on current EMS case data. Optimising the location of ambulance stations locations reduced the average response times by 57 seconds. Current and predicted future EMS demand at modelled locations were calculated and compared. CONCLUSIONS: The reallocation of ambulances to optimal locations improved response times and could contribute to higher survival rates from life-threatening medical events. Modelling EMS case 'demand' over census areas allows the data to be correlated to population characteristics and optimal 'supply' locations to be identified. Comparing current and future optimal scenarios allows more nuanced planning decisions to be made. This is a generic methodology that could be used to provide evidence in support of public health planning and decision making.",M1

Emergency medical services (EMS) plays an important role in minimizing delays to reperfusion. This study demonstrates that a large proportion of patients presenting with STEMI do not use EMS. Thus, such patients cannot benefit from many mechanisms designed to minimize time delays. Healthcare providers are challenged with both implementing strategies for improving care (minimizing delays to reperfusion) for patients not using EMS, and encouraging patients to access care via EMS in the event of acute chest pain.",M1

20095821,"Educational outreach to improve emergency medical services systems of care for stroke in Montana.OBJECTIVE: To improve stroke knowledge, identification, and acute care among first responders (FRs) and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) through educational outreach and support. METHODS: Beginning in 2006, the Montana Stroke Initiative implemented outreach to FRs and EMTs and emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) statewide. Cross-sectional telephone surveys of FRs and EMTs were used to evaluate changes in stroke knowledge and practice in 2006 (n = 988) and 2009 (n = 944), overall and in rural and urban counties. RESULTS: The respondents to the 2009 survey were more likely to report the availability of a stroke protocol in their service (69% vs. 61%, p = 0.001), training in the use of a stroke screening tool (62% vs. 42%, p &lt; 0.001), use of a stroke screening tool (62% vs. 40%, p &lt; 0.001), and an adequate level of knowledge about stroke (81% vs. 66%, p &lt; 0.001) compared with the respondents to the 2006 survey. Significant improvements in each of these areas were achieved for both rural and urban FRs and EMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Educational outreach to FRs and EMTs was associated with marked improvement in selected components of the EMS system of stroke care.",M1
20078440,"Influence of sex on the out-of-hospital management of chest pain.BACKGROUND: Sex disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of chest pain or suspected angina have been demonstrated in multiple clinical settings. Out-of-hospital (OOH) care for chest pain is protocol-driven and may be less likely to demonstrate differences between men and women. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the relationship between sex and the OOH treatment of patients with chest pain. The authors sought to test the hypothesis that OOH care for chest pain patients would differ by sex. METHODS: A 1-year retrospective cohort study of 683 emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) patients with a complaint of chest pain was conducted. Included were patients taken to any one of three hospitals (all cardiac referral centers) by a single municipal EMS system. Excluded were patients transported by basic life support (BLS) units, those younger than 30 years, and patients with known contraindications to any of the outcome measures. Multivariable regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. The main outcome was adherence to state EMS protocols for treatment of patients over age 30 years with undifferentiated chest pain. Rates of administration of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen; establishment of intravenous (IV) access; and cardiac monitoring were measured. RESULTS: A total of 342 women and 341 men were included. Women were less likely than men to receive aspirin (relative risk [RR] = 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.96), nitroglycerin (RR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.96), or an IV (RR 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77 to 0.96). These differences persisted after adjustment for demographics and emergency department (ED) evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as a blunt marker for cardiac risk. Women were also less likely to receive these treatments among the small subgroup of patients who were later diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). CONCLUSIONS: For OOH patients with chest pain, sex disparities in treatment are significant and do not appear to be explained by differences in patient age, race, or underlying cardiac risk.",M1

20053248,"Variation in the type, rate, and selection of patients for out-of-hospital airway procedures among injured children and adults.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare the type, rate, and selection of injured patients for out-of-hospital airway procedures among emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies in 10 sites across North America. METHODS: The authors analyzed a consecutive patient, prospective cohort registry of injured adults and children with an out-of-hospital advanced airway attempt, collected from December 1, 2005, through February 28, 2007, by 181 EMS agencies in 10 sites across the United States and Canada. Advanced airway procedures were defined as orotracheal intubation, nasotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway, or cricothyrotomy. Airway procedure rates were calculated based on age-specific population values for the 10 sites and the number of injured patients with field physiologic abnormality (systolic blood pressure of &lt; or = 90 mm Hg, respiratory rate of &lt;10 or &gt;29 breaths/min, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of &lt; or = 12). Descriptive measures were used to compare patients between sites. RESULTS: A total 1,738 patients had at least one advanced airway attempt and were included in the analysis. There was wide variation between sites in the types of airway procedures performed, including orotracheal intubation (63% to 99%), supraglottic airways (0 to 27%), nasotracheal intubation (0 to 21%), and cricothyrotomy (0 to 2%). Use of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) varied from 0% to 65%. The population-adjusted rates of field airway intervention (by site) ranged from 1.2 to 22.8 per 100,000 adults and 0.2 to 4.0 per 100,000 children. Among trauma patients with physiologic abnormality, some sites performed airway procedures in almost 50% of patients, while other sites used these procedures in fewer than 10%. There was also large variation in demographic characteristics, physiologic measures, mechanism of injury, mode of transport, field cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and unadjusted mortality among airway patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among 10 sites across North America, there was wide variation in the types of out-of-hospital airway procedures performed, population-based rates of airway intervention, and the selection of injured patients for such procedures.",M1
20031807,"Elapsed time in emergency medical services for patients with cardiac complaints: are some patients at greater risk for delay?BACKGROUND: In patients with a major cardiac event, the first priority is to minimize time to treatment. For many patients, first contact with the health system is through emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>). We set out to identify patient-level and neighborhood-level factors that were associated with elapsed time in EMS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 10 municipalities in Dallas County, Tex, from January 1 through December 31, 2004. The data set included 5887 patients with suspected cardiac-related symptoms. The region was served by 29 hospitals and 98 EMS depots. Multivariate models included measures of distance traveled, time of day, day of week, and patient and neighborhood characteristics. The main outcomes were elapsed time in EMS (continuous; in minutes) and delay in EMS (dichotomous; &gt;15 minutes beyond median elapsed time). We found positive associations between patient characteristics and both average elapsed time and delay in EMS care. Variation in average elapsed time was not large enough to be clinically meaningful. However, approximately 11% (n=647) of patients were delayed &gt;or=15 minutes. Women were more likely to be delayed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 1.74), and this association did not change after adjusting for other characteristics, including neighborhood socioeconomic composition. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with otherwise similar men, women have 50% greater odds of being delayed in the EMS setting. The determinants of delay should be a special focus of EMS studies in which time to treatment is a priority.",M1

METHODS: Utilizing results from a questionnaire, individuals who reported hearing problems were compared to individuals who had not. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify variables associated with hearing problems. Finally, items regarding use of hearing protection were assessed to estimate the percentage of usage among EMS professionals. RESULTS: In total, 1,058 (57%) participants responded to the questionnaire. Of those, 1,024 (97%) who completed the hearing problems question were utilized for analysis. There were 153 (14.9%) cases of self-reported hearing problems. The final logistic regression model included lifetime occupational noise exposure 0.99 (95% CI = 0.9997-1.0002), report of previous back problems (odds ratio (OR) = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.8340-4.1042), large community size (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.1211-2.4843), and minority status (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.3719-0.9867). Finally, 213 (20.8%) individuals reported utilizing some form of hearing protection at their main EMS job.

19962225,"A population-based investigation of public access defibrillation: role of emergency medical services care.BACKGROUND: Although strategic use of public access defibrillation (PAD) can improve cardiac arrest survival, little is known about temporal trends in PAD deployment and use or how PAD affects the role of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>). We sought to determine the frequency, circumstances, and time trends of PAD AED and determine implications of PAD use for EMS providers. METHODS: The investigation was a population-based cohort study of treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from a heterogeneous metropolitan setting between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2006. The study focused on cases where a PAD AED was applied. RESULTS: During the 8-year period, a PAD AED was applied in 1.5% (157/10,332) of all arrests and 4.4% (122/2759) of ventricular fibrillation arrests. PAD application increased over time overall (0.6% in 1999 to 2.4% in 2006) and among ventricular fibrillation arrests (1.8% in 1999 to 8.2% in 2006) (p&lt;0.001 test for trend). Upon EMS arrival, over 90% (143/157) of PAD cases were unconscious and 73% (114/157) required CPR. EMS defibrillation occurred in 47% (73/157). Advanced life support included intubation in 85% (134/157), epinephrine treatment in 57% (90/157), and antiarrhythmic treatment in 64% (100/157). By the end of EMS care, spontaneous pulses were present in 76% (120/157) overall and 84% (102/122) of ventricular fibrillation arrests, a 50% absolute increase when compared to status upon EMS arrival. CONCLUSION: PAD AED increased over time. Most PAD patients were pulseless upon EMS arrival and required basic and advanced resuscitation care by EMS; yet most subsequently achieved spontaneous circulation.",M1

19947875,"Evidence-based optimization of urban firefighter first response to emergency medical services 9-1-1 incidents.INTRODUCTION: Many emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) systems dispatch nonparamedic firefighter first responders (FFRs) to selected EMS 9-1-1 calls, intending to deliver time-sensitive interventions such as defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and bag-mask ventilation prior to arrival of paramedics. Deciding when to send FFRs is complicated because critical cases are rare, paramedics often arrive before FFRs, and lights-and-siren responses by emergency vehicles are associated with the risk of en-route traffic collisions. OBJECTIVE: To describe a methodology allowing EMS systems to optimize their own FFR programs using local data, and reflecting local medical oversight policy and local risk-benefit opinion. METHODS: We constructed a generalized input-output model that retrospectively reviews EMS dispatch and electronic prehospital clinical records to identify a subset of Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) call categories ( determinants ) that maximize the opportunities for FFR interventions while minimizing unwarranted responses. Input parameters include local FFR interventions, the local FFR  first-on-scene  rate, and the locally acceptable ratio of risk to benefit. The model uses a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the optimal mix of response specificity and sensitivity achieved by sending FFRs to progressively more categories of EMS calls while remaining within a defined risk-benefit ratio. The model was applied to a 16-month retrospective sample of 220,358 incidents from a large urban EMS system to compare the model's recommendations with the system's current practices. RESULTS: The model predicts that FFR lights-and-siren responses in the sample could be reduced by 83%, from 93,058 to 16,091 incidents, by confining FFR responses to 27 of 509 MPDS dispatch determinants, representing 7.3% of incidents but 58.9% of all predicted FFR interventions. Of the 93,058 incidents, another 58,275 incidents could be downgraded to safer nonemergency FFR responses and 18,692 responses could be eliminated entirely, improving the specificity of FFR response from 57.8% to 93.0%. CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a robust generalized methodology allowing EMS systems to optimize FFR lights-and-siren responses to emergency medical calls. Further validation is warranted to assess the model's generality.",M1
19947873,"Emergency medical and health providers' perceptions of key issues in prehospital patient safety.OBJECTIVES: To date, most patient safety studies have been conducted in relation to the hospital rather than the prehospital setting and data regarding emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>)-related errors are limited. To address this gap, a study was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of the views of highly experienced EMS practitioners, educators, administrators, and physicians on major issues pertaining to EMS patient safety. The intent of the study was to identify key issues to give direction to the development of best practices in education, policy, and fieldwork. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using processes described by Lincoln and Guba (1985) to enhance the quality and credibility of data and analysis. Purposive sampling was used to identify informants with knowledge and expertise regarding policy, practice, and research who could speak to the issue of patient safety. Sixteen participants, the majority of whom were Canadian, participated in in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Two major themes were identified under the category of key issues: clinical decision making and EMS's focus and relationship with health care. An education gap has developed in EMS, and there is tension between the traditional stabilize-and-transport role and the increasingly complex role that has come about through  scope creep.  If, as expected, EMS aligns increasingly with the health sector, then change is needed in the EMS educational structure and process to develop stronger clinical decision-making skills. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that many individual organizations and health regions are addressing issues related to patient safety in EMS, and there are important lessons to be learned from these groups. The broader issues identified, however, are system-wide and best addressed through policy change from health regions and government.",M1
19947872,"The North Carolina <e>EMS</e> Data System: a comprehensive integrated emergency medical services quality improvement program.BACKGROUND: The EMS Agenda for the Future describes emergency medical services (EMS) as the intersection between public health, public safety, and health care. The most comprehensive method to describe, evaluate, and optimize these systems of care is using a state EMS data system. A centralized EMS data system can be a valuable tool to identify, evaluate, target, and improve EMS service delivery and patient care. Significant barriers, however, still exist to the standardization of EMS data systems and infrastructure nationally. Indeed, there is no comprehensive measurement of EMS service delivery or patient volume at the national level. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we describe the successful development of a fully integrated, statewide EMS data system for quality improvement of EMS service delivery and patient care in North Carolina. The article also provides a platform for linking EMS with emergency physicians, other health care providers, and public health agencies responsible for planning, disease surveillance, and disaster preparedness. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The North Carolina EMS Data System represents the successful development of a large, fully integrated, comprehensive statewide EMS database and quality improvement effort. The North Carolina EMS Data System applications include the Prehospital Medical Information System (PreMIS), the Credentialing Information System (CIS), the State Medical Asset Resource Tracking Tool (SMARTT), and the EMS Performance Improvement Toolkits. The system provides a quality and performance improvement program consistent with the idealized EMS design described in the EMS Agenda for the Future. The program has already achieved significant improvements in the quality of EMS service delivery, patient care, and integrated systems of care. Consistent with the goals of the 2007 Institute of Medicine's recommendations for EMS, the linkage of the North Carolina EMS Data System with other health care registries has created an environment that can evaluate larger systems of care and ultimate patient outcomes.",M1
19947868,"Resuscitation center designation: recommendations for emergency medical services practices.Regionalization of medical resources by designating specialty receiving centers, such as trauma and stroke centers, within emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) systems is intended to ensure the highest-quality patient care in the most efficient and fiscally responsible fashion. Significant advances in the past decade such as induction of therapeutic hypothermia following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and a time-driven, algorithmic approach to management of septic patients have created compelling arguments for similar designation for specialized resuscitative interventions. Resuscitation of critically ill patients is both labor- and resource-intensive. It can significantly interrupt emergency department (ED) patient throughput. In addition, clinical progress in developing resuscitation techniques is often dependent on the presence of a strong research infrastructure to generate and validate new therapies. It is not feasible for many hospitals to make the commitment to care for large numbers of critically ill patients and the accompanying investigational activities, whether in the prehospital, ED, or inpatient arena. Because of this, the question of whether EMS systems should designate specific hospitals as  resuscitation centers  has now come center stage. Just as EMS systems currently delineate criteria and monitor compliance for trauma, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and stroke centers, strong logic now exists to develop similar standards for resuscitation facilities. Accordingly, this discussion reviews the current applicable trends in resuscitation science and presents a rationale for resuscitation center designation within EMS systems. Potential barriers to the establishment of such centers are discussed and strategies to overcome them are proposed.",M1
19947864,"Effect of airway-securing method on prehospital endotracheal tube dislodgment.OBJECTIVE: We compared the effectiveness of common airway-securing techniques in preventing endotracheal tube (ETT) dislodgment in the prehospital setting. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted at 42 emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies. EMS providers completed structured, closed-response data forms for all endotracheal intubation (ETI) attempts during an 18-month period. We included all successful intubations as well as failed ETIs in which ETT securing was performed. EMS providers indicated methods used to secure the ETT, including the use of adhesive tape to the face (face tape), tape wrapped around the neck (neck tape), woven twill or umbilical tape (twill tape), intravenous or oxygen tubing (tubing), commercial tube holders, and manual stabilization/none. Providers also indicated the concurrent use of a cervical collar and/or cervical immobilization device (CID) with backboard. ETT dislodgment was reported by providers. We evaluated the rates and odds of ETT dislodgment for each tube-securing technique using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,732 patients undergoing tube-securing efforts, ETT dislodgment occurred in 51 (2.9%). ETT dislodgment rates were as follows: tube held manually, four of 32 (12.5%); face tape, 13 of 292 (4.5%); neck tape, nine of 205 (4.4%); twill tape, zero of 67 (0%); tubing, one of 30 (3.3%); commercial tube holders, 25 of 1,111 (2.3%); cervical collar, two of 121 (1.7%); and CID, 12 of 377 (3.2 %). On multivariate regression, when compared with securing the tube with face tape, only manually holding the tube in place showed a significant difference in the odds of dislodgment (odds ratio [OR] 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-15.2). Whereas cardiac arrest and trauma did not increase the odds of ETT dislodgment (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.6; and OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.4, respectively), patient age less than 5 years was associated with ETT dislodgment (OR 6.6, 95% CI 2.2-19.7). CONCLUSION: In this multicenter observational series, the odds of ETT dislodgment were similar for face tape, neck tape, twill tape, plastic tubing, and commercial tube holders. ETT dislodgment did not occur with woven twill tape. Patients under 5 years of age are at heightened risk for ETT dislodgment.",M1
19947862,"An assessment of key health indicators among emergency medical services professionals.INTRODUCTION: Ensuring the health and productivity of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) professionals is important. However, there has been no known national baseline assessment of the health and wellness of EMS professionals in the United States. According to Healthy People 2010, top indicators of personal health include physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking prevalence. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study included quantifying existing health conditions and describing key health indicators among EMS professionals. It was hypothesized that work-life characteristics were associated with existing health conditions and key health indicators. METHODS: Data utilized for this analysis were obtained from a 2007 questionnaire included in biennial national recertification packets. This questionnaire utilized validated items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the Longitudinal EMT Attributes and Demographics Study (LEADS). Along with common demographic characteristics, items inquired about existing health conditions (diabetes, asthma, hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, and/or high blood cholesterol level), general health, physical activity, and smoking status. Descriptive analyses were performed utilizing chi-square tests, and logistic regression was utilized to describe associations between existing health conditions and the key health indicators. RESULTS: There were 58,435 individuals who became recertified in 2007, with 30,560 (52%) returning questionnaires. Individuals with missing data were removed, leaving 19,960 individual records. There were 4,681 (23.5%) individuals who reported at least one existing health condition. The mean BMI for the study participants was 27.69 kg/m(2). There were 5,742 (28.8%) individuals classified as having normal weight and 5,146 (25.8%) who were obese. The overwhelming majority of individuals did not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for physical activity (15,022, 75.3%). There were 3,394 (17.0%) individuals classified as current smokers. Finally, logistic regression analysis indicated that when controlling for work-life characteristics and age, BMI and level of physical fitness were associated with preexisting health conditions. CONCLUSION: This study was the first known baseline assessment of EMS professionals regarding the key health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010. Investigations regarding the impact of health and wellness in relation to workforce stability should be undertaken. Further research should also be conducted to identify strategies to improve the health of the EMS workforce.",M1
19947860,"Frequency of non-ST-segment elevation injury patterns on prehospital electrocardiograms.INTRODUCTION: Prehospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recommended to facilitate early diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, prehospital ECGs can also be used to triage patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, who comprise a majority of patients with ischemic events presenting by ambulance to overcrowded emergency departments. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the frequency of non-ST-segment elevation injury patterns on prehospital ECGs in patients with a chief complaint of chest pain evaluated by the emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system. METHODS: We analyzed prehospital ECGs of patients with the chief complaint of chest pain during a nine-month period. The ECGs were divided into three categories: injury pattern; no injury pattern; and technically uninterpretable. Injury pattern criteria were as follows: 1) regional ST depression &gt;or=1.0 mm; 2) regional T-wave inversion (TWI) &gt;or=3 mm; 3) left bundle branch block (LBBB); and 4) regional ST-segment elevation &gt;or=1.0 mm. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. RESULTS: Prehospital ECGs were obtained for 322 of 340 chest pain patients: 72% were men; the average age was 60 years (range 18-96 years). Seventy-seven ECGs (24%, 95% CI 19.3-28.9%) met the criteria for injury pattern, 230 (71%) did not show injury, and 15 (5%) were uninterpretable. Of the 77 ECGs that exhibited an injury pattern, 39 (51%) showed ST depression, seven (9%) TWI, seven (9%) LBBB, and 24 (31%) ST-segment elevation. Thus, non-ST-segment elevation injury patterns (ST depression/TWI/LBBB) accounted for 53 (17%, 95% CI 12.6-20.9) of the total 322 prehospital ECGs. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate a relatively high frequency (17%) of non-ST-segment elevation injury patterns on prehospital ECGs of patients who summon EMS because of chest pain. These results suggest the potential of prehospital ECGs to facilitate early triage in these high-risk chest pain patients who present to overcrowded emergency departments.",M1

This fragmentation is evident throughout the EMS system in the way we educate, train, certify, and recertify the pre-hospital professional. In Louisiana EMS, there are two facets of our education system: the training/education institution and the instructors who facilitate the education. However, there is no mandated credentialing of the institution doing the teaching. Currently, the State of Louisiana utilizes both the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians computer-based written examination as well as their practical examination. Louisiana has four provider levels of EMS professionals: First Responder (FR), Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B), EMT-Intermediate/85 (EMT-I/85), and EMT-Paramedic. Creating consistency in the levels of EMS will enhance both education and patient care ensuring that all citizens of the state will receive the most appropriate and up to date pre-hospital care. Louisiana will also be adopting the National Registry's Accreditation Policy, which will require all advanced level education (Paramedic) to be conducted by CoAEMSP (Committee on Accreditation of Educational Programs for the EMS Profession) institutions. Louisiana's challenge will exist with the adoption of the Scope of Practice Model levels and the movement of our current certification system to a licensure system. The goal is to create an EMS system in Louisiana that is substantiated by a national curriculum, national accreditation, a national scope of practice and the passage of a national examination.",M1
19901646,"Improving rural emergency medical service response time with global positioning system navigation.OBJECTIVE: Rural emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) often serves expansive areas that many EMS personnel are unfamiliar with. EMS response time is increased in rural areas, which has been suggested as a contributing factor to increased mortality rates from motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) and nontraumatic emergencies. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a global positioning system (GPS) on rural EMS response time. METHODS: GPS units were placed in ambulances of a rural EMS provider. The GPS units were set for fastest route (not shortest distance) to the scene that depends on traffic lights and posted road speed. During a 1-year period from September 2006 to August 2007, EMS response time and mileage to the scene were recorded for MVCs and other emergencies. Response times and mileage to the scene were then compared with data from the same EMS provider during a similar 1-year period when GPS technology was not used. EMS calls less than 1-mile were removed from both data sets because GPS was infrequently used for short travel distances. RESULTS: During the 1-year period before utilization of GPS, 893 EMS calls greater than 1 mile were recorded and 791 calls recorded with GPS. The mean EMS response time for MVCs was 8.5 minutes without GPS and 7.6 minutes with GPS (p &lt; 0.0001). When MVCs were matched for miles traveled, mean EMS response time without GPS was 13.7 minutes versus 9.9 minutes with GPS (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: GPS technology can significantly improve EMS response time to the scene of MVCs and nontraumatic emergencies.",M1

We report an international long-distance repatriation flight by the helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS), with a total flight time of almost 7 hours. The flight itself, the medical requirements, and aviation problems are discussed. The operation of the flight itself was almost uneventful thanks to careful preflight planning; however, it also proved challenging because of national regulations and airspace structures, which were somewhat different from those of Germany. The treatment of the patient during the flight was not affected by the extraordinarily long distance. We conclude that a combination of appropriate preflight planning, radio communication, and close cooperation with legal authorities is the key to accomplishing a successful execution of an international repatriation missions by the HEMS.",M1

19893482,"Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry Surveillance - four states, 2005-2007.PROBLEM/CONDITION: Each year, approximately 795,000 persons in the United States experience a new or recurrent stroke. Data from the prototype phase (2001-2004) of the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry (PCNASR) suggested that numerous acute stroke patients did not receive treatment according to established guidelines. REPORTING PERIOD: This report summarizes PCNASR data collected during 2005-2007 from Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, the first states to have PCNASRs implemented in and led by state health departments. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: PCNASR was established by CDC in 2001 to track and improve the quality of hospital-based acute stroke care. The prototype phase (2001-2004) registries were led by CDC-funded clinical investigators in academic and medical institutions, whereas the full implementation of the 2005-2007 statewide registries was led by CDC-funded state health departments. Health departments in each state recruit hospitals to collect data. To be included in PCNASR, patients must be aged &gt;or=18 years and have a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code indicative of a stroke or TIA. Data for patients who are already hospitalized at the time of stroke are not included. The following 10 performance measures of care, based on established guidelines for care of acute stroke patients, were developed by CDC in partnership with neurologists who specialize in stroke care: 1) received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, 2) received antithrombotic therapy at discharge, 3) received anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, 4) received tissue plasminogen activator (among eligible patients), 5) received antithrombotic therapy within 48 hours of admission or by the end of the second hospital day, 6) received lipid level testing, 7) received dysphagia screening, 8) received stroke education, 9) received smoking cessation counseling, and 10) received assessment for rehabilitation services. Adherence to these performance measures of care was calculated using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 195 hospitals from Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, and North Carolina contributed data to PCNASR during 2005-2007, representing 56,969 patients. Approximately half (53.3%) the cases of stroke in the registry occurred among females. A total of 2.5% of cases were among Hispanics; however, the proportion varied significantly by state. Cases among black patients ranged from 5.6% in Massachusetts to 35.8% in Georgia. The age at which patients experienced stroke varied significantly by state. On average, patients were oldest in Massachusetts (median age: 77 years) and youngest in Georgia (median age: 67 years). Overall, the clinical diagnosis for registry stroke cases was hemorrhagic stroke (13.8% of cases), ischemic stroke (56.2%), ill-defined stroke (i.e., medical record did not specify ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; 7.3%), and TIA (21.6%). A total of 18.5% of patients with stroke symptoms arrived at the hospital within 2 hours of symptom onset; however, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital arrival was not recorded or was not known for the majority (57.8%) of patients. Of the 56,969 patients, 47.6% were transported by emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) from the scene of symptom onset, 11.1% were transferred by EMS from another hospital, and 39.4% used private or other transportation. Adherence to acute stroke care measures defined by PCNASR were as follows: received antithrombotic therapy at discharge (97.6%), received antithrombotic therapy within 48 hours of admission or by the end of the second hospital day (94.6%), assessed for rehabilitation services (90.1%), received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis (85.5%), received anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation (82.5%), received smoking cessation counseling (78.6%), received lipid level testing (69.9%), received stroke education (58.8%), received dysphagia screening (56.7%), and received tissue plasminogen activator (among eligible patients) (39.8%). INTERPRETATION: Between 2001-2004 (prototype phase) and 2005-2007 (implementation by state health departments), substantial improvement occurred in dysphagia screening, lipid testing, smoking cessation counseling, and antithrombotic therapy prescribed at discharge. These initial improvements indicate that a surveillance system to track and improve the quality of hospital-based stroke care can be led successfully by state health departments, although further evaluations over time are needed. Despite these improvements, additional increases are needed in adherence to these and other performance measures. Nearly 40% of stroke patients did not use EMS services for transport to hospitals, and no change occurred in the proportion of patients who arrived at the hospital in time to receive thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke. Patients who are not promptly transported to hospitals after symptom onset are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy and other timely interventions for acute stroke. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Results from PCNASR indicate the need for additional public health measures to inform the public of the need for timely activation of EMS services for signs and symptoms of stroke. In addition, low rates of adherence to certain measures of stroke care underscore the need for continuing coordinated programs to improve stroke quality of care. Additional analyses are needed to assess improvements in adherence to guidelines over time.",M1

19840697,"Urban sprawl and delayed ambulance arrival in the U.S.BACKGROUND: Minimizing emergency medical service (<e>EMS</e>) response time is a central objective of prehospital care, yet the potential influence of built environment features such as urban sprawl on EMS system performance is often not considered. PURPOSE: This study measures the association between urban sprawl and EMS response time to test the hypothesis that features of sprawling development increase the probability of delayed ambulance arrival. METHODS: In 2008, EMS response times for 43,424 motor-vehicle crashes were obtained from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System, a national census of crashes involving &gt; or =1 fatality. Sprawl at each crash location was measured using a continuous county-level index previously developed by Ewing et al. The association between sprawl and the probability of a delayed ambulance arrival (&gt; or =8 minutes) was then measured using generalized linear mixed modeling to account for correlation among crashes from the same county. RESULTS: Urban sprawl is significantly associated with increased EMS response time and a higher probability of delayed ambulance arrival (p=0.03). This probability increases quadratically as the severity of sprawl increases while controlling for nighttime crash occurrence, road conditions, and presence of construction. For example, in sprawling counties (e.g., Fayette County GA), the probability of a delayed ambulance arrival for daytime crashes in dry conditions without construction was 69% (95% CI=66%, 72%) compared with 31% (95% CI=28%, 35%) in counties with prominent smart-growth characteristics (e.g., Delaware County PA). CONCLUSIONS: Urban sprawl is significantly associated with increased EMS response time and a higher probability of delayed ambulance arrival following motor-vehicle crashes in the U.S. The results of this study suggest that promotion of community design and development that follows smart-growth principles and regulates urban sprawl may improve EMS performance and reliability.",M1
19815310,"Occupational exposures in emergency medical service providers and knowledge of and compliance with universal precautions.BACKGROUND: Little is known about compliance with universal precautions (CUP) or occupational exposures to blood and body fluids among Emergency Medical Services (<e>EMS</e>) providers. The objective of this study was to obtain estimates of CUP and knowledge of universal precautions (KUP), occupational exposures, and needle and lancet sticks in the prehospital environment. METHODS: A convenience sample of workers (n=311, 51% response) from 17 agencies in Virginia that provided emergency ground transportation (volunteer, commercial, government rescue squads, and fire departments) completed a questionnaire on certification and training, KUP, CUP, exposures and needlesticks, risk perceptions, and demographic variables. RESULTS: Nearly all EMS providers reported exposures and were concerned about risk of HIV and hepatitis. Providers reported inconsistent CUP when treating patients or using needles, including failure to wear gloves (17%) and to appropriately dispose of contaminated materials (79%), including needles (87%), at all times. Certification type (advanced and basic) was related to both KUP and CUP. Of those respondents reporting current sharps use, 40% recapped needles. A lancet stick was reported by 1.4% (n=5), and 4.5% reported a needlestick (n=14). CONCLUSION: EMS providers working in the prehospital environment experience significant exposures but are not consistently using universal precautions.",M1
19806636,"Impact of the prehospital ECG on door-to-balloon time in ST elevation myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: National guidelines have been set to achieve door-to-balloon time (D2B) is less than 90 minutes to improve outcomes for patients with STEMI. The purpose of this study is to see if a more aggressive approach utilizing prehospital ECGs could improve reperfusion times. METHODS: The <e>EMS</e> personnel obtained a 12-lead ECG during initial assessment in the field from patients with chest pain. The ECG was immediately transmitted to the ER physician by cellular link to a computer receiving station. The ER physician reviewed the ECG digital tracing. The cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) team was activated from the patients' homes. Patients were transported from the field directly to the CCL by EMS bypassing the emergency department. RESULTS: The mean D2B for patients with initial ECG in hospital in all three hospitals combined was 90.5 minutes, compared to 60.2 minutes in patients with prehospital ECG. (P &lt; 0.0001). When analyzing the mean D2B in regards to times of presentation, we found a significant reduction in mean D2B in patients presenting during working hours (75 minutes) compared with those presenting during off hours (98 minutes) in the control group. However, with the use of prehospital ECGs, there was a significant reduction in D2B regardless of what time the patient arrived in the ER. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing the prehospital ECG as a tool to bypass ER triage significantly decreases D2B times in patients with STEMI. This technology has the potential to substantially expedite reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI.",M1
19788792,"Underuse of prehospital strategies to reduce time to reperfusion for ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients in 5 Canadian provinces.OBJECTIVE: Timely reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an important determinant of outcome, yet targets for time to treatment are frequently unmet in North America. Prehospital strategies can reduce time to reperfusion. We sought to determine the extent to which emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) use these strategies in Canada. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional survey in 2007 of ground EMS operators in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. We focused on the use of 4 prehospital strategies: 1) 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 2) routine expedited emergency department (ED) transfer of STEMI patients (from a referring ED to a percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] centre), 3) prehospital bypass (ambulance bypass of local EDs to transport patients directly to PCI centres) and 4) prehospital fibrinolysis. RESULTS: Ninety-seven ambulance operators were surveyed, representing 15 681 paramedics serving 97% of the combined provincial populations. Of the operators surveyed, 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59%-77%) had ambulances equipped with 12-lead ECGs, ranging from 40% in Quebec to 100% in Alberta and Nova Scotia. Overall, 47% (95% CI 46%-48%) of paramedics were trained in ECG acquisition and 40% (95% CI 39%-41%) were trained in ECG interpretation. Only 18% (95% CI 10%-25%) of operators had prehospital bypass protocols; 45% (95% CI 35%-55%) had protocols for expedited ED transfer. Prehospital fibrinolysis was available only in Alberta. All EMS operators in British Columbia, Alberta and Nova Scotia used at least 1 of the 4 prehospital strategies, and one-third of operators in Ontario and Quebec used 0 of 4. In major urban centres, at least 1 of the 3 prehospital strategies 12-lead ECG acquisition, bypass or expedited transfer was used, but there was considerable variation within and across provinces. CONCLUSION: The implementation of widely recommended prehospital STEMI strategies varies substantially across the 5 provinces studied, and relatively simple existing technologies, such as prehospital ECGs, are underused in many regions. Substantial improvements in prehospital services and better integration with hospital-based care will be necessary in many regions of Canada if optimal times to reperfusion, and associated outcomes, are to be achieved.",M1

19780921,"Designated medical directors for emergency medical services: recruitment and roles.CONTEXT: Emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies rely on medical oversight to support Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) in the provision of prehospital care. Most states require EMS agencies to have a designated medical director (DMD), who typically is responsible for the many activities of medical oversight. PURPOSE: To assess rural-urban differences in obtaining a DMD and in their responsibilities. METHODS: A national survey of 1,425 local EMS directors, conducted in 2007. FINDINGS: Rural EMS directors were more likely than urban ones to report DMD recruitment problems, but recruitment barriers were similar, with the most commonly reported barrier being an unwillingness of local physicians to serve. Rural EMS directors reported that their DMDs were less likely to be trained in Emergency Medicine, and were less likely to provide educational support functions such as continuing education. Rural agencies were more likely to get on-line medical direction from their DMD, but were less likely to always get the on-line support they needed. Common barriers to on-line support were typical of rural communication barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Existing recommendations for DMD qualifications may be difficult to attain in rural communities. To develop programs that will support medical direction for rural EMS agencies, it is important to learn what physicians identify as the barriers to serving as DMDs, and whether there are alternative and innovative ways to provide an optimal level of medical oversight. Solutions will likely be multi-faceted, as EMS activities and organizational structures are diverse and the responsibilities of the DMD are broad.",M1
19770172,"Joint policy statement--guidelines for care of children in the emergency department.Children who require emergency care have unique needs, especially when emergencies are serious or life-threatening. The majority of ill and injured children are brought to community hospital emergency departments (EDs) by virtue of their geography within communities. Similarly, emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies provide the bulk of out-of-hospital emergency care to children. It is imperative, therefore, that all hospital EDs have the appropriate resources (medications, equipment, policies, and education) and staff to provide effective emergency care for children. This statement outlines resources necessary to ensure that hospital EDs stand ready to care for children of all ages, from neonates to adolescents. These guidelines are consistent with the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine's report on the future of emergency care in the United States health system. Although resources within emergency and trauma care systems vary locally, regionally, and nationally, it is essential that hospital ED staff and administrators and EMS systems' administrators and medical directors seek to meet or exceed these guidelines in efforts to optimize the emergency care of children they serve.

This study sought to elucidate how long it takes to implement new guidelines. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. From July 2005 to January 2008, we included all patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of suspected cardiac cause. We analyzed Emergency Medical System (<e>EMS</e>) Guideline usage via defibrillator recordings of the continuous ECG and impedance signals. We excluded patients with missing or otherwise unusable ECGs. All shocks and CPR cycles were individually classified. The same Guideline needed to be applied for at least 75% of all shocks and CPR cycles. If no shocks had been given, continuous ECGs were classified by its CPR status only. Continuous ECGs were classified as G1992, G2000 or G2005. If at least 75% of the shocks were given according to G2000 and at least 75% of the CPR was according to G2005, the Guideline protocol was classified as intermediate. All analyses that did not fulfil any Guideline criteria were classified as indeterminate. RESULTS: Of 1672 analyzable resuscitations, 31 (2%) used G1992, 826 (49%) G2000, 608 (36%) G2005, and 125 (7%) intermediate Guidelines. The Guideline protocol could not be identified for the remaining 81 (5%) patients. It took 17 months (from publication) until EMS personnel applied GL2005 in over 80% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our experience shows it took one-and-a-half years to effectively implement new resuscitation Guidelines. We believe improvements in implementation can shorten this to six months.",M1

To explore the feasibility of using emergency medical services data to monitor prehospital stroke care in Utah, the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program and the state emergency medical services agency identified variables that could potentially be used to describe prehospital stroke care and explored the actual data from the first 16 months since inception of a system compatible with NEMSIS. We were able to develop a case definition for possible stroke and to describe modes of response, response times, destination hospitals, and stroke screening practices.

DESIGN: The training program consisted of six modules: WMD knowledge and event detection, ocular anatomy, ocular first aid (ie, flushing, cupping, and patching), and three WMD simulations (ie, sarin gas release, anthrax release, and radioactive dispersal device). Pretest, post-test, and 1-month follow-up test and a program evaluation were used to measure knowledge gain and retention and to assess the effectiveness of the program. SETTING: New York State EMS. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and sixty-four individuals participated in the training program and all waves of the testing (86 percent retention rate). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: The effectiveness of the training intervention was measured using pretest and post-test questionnaires and analyzed using dependent t-tests. RESULTS: Assessment scores for overall knowledge increased from the pretest (mean = 15.7, standard deviation [SD] = 2.1) to the post-test (mean = 17.8, SD = 1.3), p &lt; 0.001, and from pretest (mean = 15.7, SD = 2.1) to 1-month follow-up test (mean = 16.6, SD = 2.0), p &lt; 0.001. Ninety-two percent of respondents indicated that the program reinforced understanding of WMDs. CONCLUSIONS: This training method provides an effective and low-cost approach to educate and evaluate EMS personnel on emergency treatment of eye trauma associated with the use of WMD. Online training should also be supplemented with hands-on practice and refresher trainings.",M1
19736153,"How to set up an effective national primary angioplasty network: lessons learned from five European countries.AIMS: Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are used to treat acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease. While in chronic forms the main goal of PCI is to improve the quality of life, in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) timely PCI is a life-saving procedure - especially in the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to describe the experience of countries with successful nationwide implementation of PCI in STEMI, and to provide general recommendations for other countries. METHODS AND RESULTS: The European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) recenty launched the Stent For Life Initiative (SFLI). The initial phase of this pan-European project was focused on the positive experience of five countries to provide the best practice examples. The Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark and Austria were visited and the logistics of ACS treatment was studied. Public campaigns improved patient access to acute PCI. Regional networks involving emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>), non-PCI hospitals and PCI centres are useful in providing access to acute PCI for most patients. Direct transfer from the first medical contact site to the cathlab is essential to minimise the time delays. Cathlab staff work is organised to provide acute PCI services 24 hours a day / seven days a week (24/7). Even in those regions where thrombolysis is still used due to long transfer distances to PCI, patients should still be transferred to a PCI centre (after thrombolysis). The highest risk non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction patients should undergo emergency coronary angiography within two hours of hospital admission, i.e. similar to STEMI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Three realistic goals for other countries were defined based on these experiences: 1) primary PCI should be used for &gt;70% of all STEMI patients, 2) primary PCI rates should reach &gt;600 per million inhabitants per year and 3) existing PCI centres should treat all their STEMI patients by primary PCI, i.e. should offer a 24/7 service.",M1
19731171,"Carbon footprinting of emergency medical services systems: a proof-of-concept study.OBJECTIVE: In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the availability of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system energy consumption data required to calculate a carbon footprint. METHODS: Two diverse North American EMS systems with more than 125,000 combined annual unit responses agreed to report their energy consumption for the last fiscal or calendar year using a data-collection tool based on Carbon Trust recommendations. They also identified the source of information (e.g., bills, logs, receipts), whether the amounts reported were directly measured or estimated, and whether any of the amounts were prorated from shared facilities (e.g., electricity for a shared office building). For this proof-of-concept study, we report only descriptive data about the availability of data and aggregate carbon emissions. RESULTS: Both systems reported diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity consumption. One system used natural gas; one system used aviation fuel. Direct measurement of consumption using utility bills and statements was possible for these energy types. One system prorated natural gas and electricity usage; one system was able to estimate commercial air travel. Annual carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions for these two systems totaled 11.1 million pounds of CO(2). The largest source of CO(2) emissions was diesel fuel (39%), followed by electricity (23%). CONCLUSION: These EMS systems were able to provide the data necessary to determine their carbon footprints. Future research could include broader study to establish EMS-specific norms for carbon emissions, benchmarking of these metrics between different EMS systems, and the assessment of programs designed to reduce EMS carbon emissions.",M1
19731165,"Intranasal naloxone is a viable alternative to intravenous naloxone for prehospital narcotic overdose.OBJECTIVE: To compare the prehospital time intervals from patient contact and medication administration to clinical response for intranasal (IN) versus intravenous (IV) naloxone in patients with suspected narcotic overdose. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) and hospital records, before and after implementation of a protocol for administration of intranasal naloxone by the Central California EMS Agency. We included patients with suspected narcotic overdose treated in the prehospital setting over 17 months, between March 2003 and July 2004. Paramedics documented dose, route of administration, and positive response times using an electronic record. Clinical response was defined as an increase in respiratory rate (breaths/min) or Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 6. Main outcome variables included time from medication to clinical response and time from patient contact to clinical response. Secondary variables included numbers of doses administered and rescue doses given by an alternate route. Between-group comparisons were accomplished using t-tests and chi-square tests as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients met the inclusion criteria, including 104 treated with IV and 50 treated with IN naloxone. Clinical response was noted in 33 (66%) and 58 (56%) of the IN and IV groups, respectively (p = 0.3). The mean time between naloxone administration and clinical response was longer for the IN group (12.9 vs. 8.1 min, p = 0.02). However, the mean times from patient contact to clinical response were not significantly different between the IN and IV groups (20.3 vs. 20.7 min, p = 0.9). More patients in the IN group received two doses of naloxone (34% vs. 18%, p = 0.05), and three patients in the IN group received a subsequent dose of IV or IM naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: The time from dose administration to clinical response for naloxone was longer for the IN route, but the overall time from patient contact to response was the same for the IV and IN routes. Given the difficulty and potential hazards in obtaining IV access in many patients with narcotic overdose, IN naloxone appears to be a useful and potentially safer alternative.",M1
19731162,"Effect of emergency medical technician-placed Combitubes on outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest.OBJECTIVE: While emergency medical technicians-basic (EMT-Bs) in select emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies use the Esophageal Tracheal Combitube (ETC) for the airway management of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests, the effect of this intervention on patient outcomes is not known. We compared the associations between initial EMT ETC placement and initial paramedic endotracheal intubation (ETI) on patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. METHODS: We utilized data on adult (age &gt; 21 years), out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests from a large, urban, county-based, two-tiered (EMT-B first responder, paramedic ambulance) EMS system for the years 1997-2005. EMT-Bs placed an ETC on cardiopulmonary arrest patients if they arrived before paramedics. Paramedics managed the airway primarily using ETI. We included cases in which rescuers accomplished ETC insertion or ETI on the first airway effort. We excluded cases in which an invasive airway was not used. We excluded cases with failed airway insertion or multiple airway efforts. We examined return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge. We evaluated the association between outcome and airway type (ETC vs. ETI) using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, bystander-witnessed arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), bystander automated external defibrillator (AED) use, initial electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm, and response time. RESULTS: Of 7,010 adult cardiopulmonary arrests, we excluded 747 cases without airway insertion and 441 cases involving failed or multiple airway efforts. Of the remaining 5,822 cardiopulmonary arrests, 4,335 (74%) received initial paramedic ETI and 1,437 (26%) received initial EMT-B ETC insertion. Compared with paramedic ETI, EMT-B ETC placement was not associated with ROSC (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-1.05), survival to hospital admission (adjusted OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.86-1.13), or survival to hospital discharge (adjusted OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.79-1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with initial paramedic ETI, initial EMT-B ETC placement was not associated with patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",M1
19731159,"Impact of the 2005 American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care guidelines on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival.OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) survival before and after the release of the 2005 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC). METHODS: Data were extracted from an OOHCA registry for 1,681 adult cases of cardiac arrest treated by one emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system between April 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007, in a large city (2005 population 730,657). The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. A convenience sample of 69 electronic electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings was reviewed to assess CPR quality parameters using impedance waveform analysis during corresponding time periods. Intervention. Implementation of the 2005 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC in spring 2006. RESULTS: The annual treated OOHCA incidence rate was 68/100,000; and the treated ventricular fibrillation (VF) incidence rate was 15/100,000. Bystanders performed CPR in 28% of cases. Public automated external defibrillator (AED) use was &lt; 2% over the entire study, and few patients received hypothermia therapy. Unadjusted OOHCA survival rates were significantly higher in the postguidelines period at 9.4% (n = 1,021) than in the preguidelines period at 6.1% (n = 660), despite similarities in all major predictors of outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.4). Bystander-witnessed OOHCA survival for victims in VF on EMS arrival was 19 of 78 (24%) in the preguidelines period versus 34 of 112 (30%) in the postguidelines period (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.7 to 2.6). CPR quality measures showed significant improvement in the postguidelines period. The mean no-flow fraction in the preguidelines group was 0.46 and dropped to 0.34 in the postguidelines group, a difference of 0.12 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.19). Multivariate regression analysis adjusting for significant predictors of survival showed that OOHCA in the postguidelines period was associated with 1.8 greater odds of survival than in the preguidelines period (95% CI 1.2 to 2.7). CONCLUSION: In this large city, substantial improvement occurred in overall OOHCA survival rates following the implementation of the 2005 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC. These changes were associated with improvements in the quality of CPR.",M1
19731158,"Work-family fit: the impact of emergency medical services work on the family system.INTRODUCTION: The stress associated with a career in emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) can impact the work-family fit and function of the family system for EMS personnel. Little research has been conducted on how the demands associated with a career in EMS influences family life. Objective. To describe salient EMS work factors that can impact the family system. METHODS: Twelve family members (11 spouses and one parent) of EMS workers were interviewed using a semistructured qualitative interview guide that explored issues related to their family members' work that could impact the quality of family life. Using a phenomenological approach, transcribed interview data were examined for themes that illuminated factors that influence work-family fit. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed that shift work impacts numerous aspects of family life, including marital and parental roles, leisure and social opportunities, and home schedules and rhythms. Furthermore, families coped with challenges associated with their loved one's EMS work through negotiating role responsibilities, developing their own interests, giving their family member  space,  and providing support by listening and helping the EMS worker process his or her reactions to difficult work. In addition, family members reported concern over their EMS worker's physical safety. CONCLUSION: Implications from the data are discussed vis-a-vis the work-family fit and family systems models. Education, communication, support systems, and individual interests are key ways to promote a healthy work-family fit.",M1
19731156,"Comparison of public safety provider injury rates.INTRODUCTION: During normal operations, public safety personnel may become injured, leading them to seek medical care and possible time off. Examining the nature and patterns of injury may help to identify preventive health measures for all public safety personnel and address specific needs of each discipline based on actual risk. Objective. To determine the types and severity of injuries encountered by public safety personnel during routine work conditions within a single urban population. METHODS: De-identified workers' compensation data for emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>), fire, and police providers from one urban center between January 1, 2005, and May 31, 2007, were examined. Data included type of injury, severity of injury, and date of event. Severity was categorized as follows: lost time (type 1), medical evaluation (type 2), report only (type 3), restricted duty (type 4), and not reported (type 5). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a pairwise t-test between groups with a Bonferroni correction was performed to determine the relative risk of injuries between groups. RESULTS: During the 29-month interval, an average workforce of 850 firefighters, 194 EMS providers, and 850 police officers were employed. A total of 1,295 workers' compensation events were documented, with 243 (18%) reported from EMS, 477 (36%) from fire, and 608 (46%) from police. Type 1 injuries were more common in fire (39%) and police (38%) than EMS (23%). EMS had higher rates of lost work (type 1) and medical evaluations (type 2) than both fire and police. Workers' compensation events common to all bureaus were minor trauma (76%) and exposures to blood-borne pathogens (12%). Minor traumatic injuries, mostly associated with axial musculoskeletal strains and extremity injuries, were responsible for the majority of injuries resulting in missed work. Injuries more common in a specific bureau included motor vehicle crashes and gunshot wounds (police) and cardiovascular disease, burns, and heat illness (fire). CONCLUSION: Public safety personnel are affected by both profession-specific and non-profession-specific injuries. Overall, EMS has higher rates of missed time and medical evaluations than both fire and police. These data highlight the need to make direct comparisons of various public safety personnel bureaus using a common time interval and locale in order to rationally plan interventions and apply resources.",M1
19731155,"Lack of association between prehospital response times and patient outcomes.BACKGROUND: Limited data exist that examine the relationship between prehospital response times (RTs) and improved patient outcomes. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that patient outcomes do not differ substantially based on an explicitly chosen advanced life support (ALS) RT upper limit of 10 minutes 59 seconds (10:59 minutes). METHODS: This case-control retrospective study was conducted in a metropolitan county with a population of 750,000 for the calendar year 2004. The emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) system is a single-tiered, ALS paramedic service that includes basic life support (BLS) first responders. The 90% fractile RT specification required by contractual agreement is 10:59 minutes or less for emergency, life-threatening (Priority 1) calls. Cases (study patients), defined as Priority 1 transports with RTs exceeding 10:59 minutes, were compared with controls, which comprised a random sample of Priority 1 calls with RTs of 10:59 minutes or less. Prehospital run reports and hospital outcomes were evaluated using explicit criteria by one observer for the primary outcome of in-hospital death and secondary outcomes of critical interventions performed in the field. We tested the hypothesis of equivalence using the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for difference in proportions with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2 to show Delta = +/- 5%. RESULTS: Of the 3,270 emergency transports in 2004, we identified 373 study patients (RT &gt; 10:59 min) and a random sample of 373 controls (RT &lt; or = 10:59 min). Survival to hospital discharge was 80% (76% to 84%) for study patients vs. 82% (77% to 85%) for controls, yielding a 95% CI for the difference of -6 to +4%. ALS procedures were performed in 47.7% (95% CI: 43% to 53%) of study patients vs. 45.4% (40% to 51%) of controls (95% difference in proportions -10 to +5%). The most frequently performed procedures were administration of nitroglycerine and endotracheal intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients who wait 10:59 minutes or less for ALS response, Priority 1 patients who wait longer than 10:59 minutes could experience between a 6% increase and a 4% decrease in mortality, and do not have an increase in critical procedures performed in the field. Our data are most consistent with the inference that neither the mortality nor the frequency of critical procedural interventions varies substantially based on this prespecified ALS RT.",M1
19731153,"Prospective evaluation of an emergency medical services-administered alternative transport protocol.BACKGROUND: The ability of emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) providers to offer an alternative means of nonemergent transport for patients with minor medical complaints is a rarely sanctioned concept in U.S. EMS systems. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine if paramedics using transport guidelines can identify patients with minor medical problems who can be safely transported by a nonmedical alternative transport mechanism (taxi). METHODS: Paramedics in the city of Norfolk, Virginia, who had more than one year of experience and who had completed the study orientation course were eligible to enroll subjects in the study. Predetermined alternative transport exclusion criteria as well as inclusion guidelines were provided to paramedics. After on-scene evaluation, paramedics identified subjects who met the enrollment criteria and were deemed safe for emergent ambulance transport. Enrolled subjects were provided a prepaid taxi voucher, which allowed for transport to the closest emergency department (ED). Patients who refused study participation were transported to the ED by ambulance. RESULTS: Ninety-three subjects were enrolled and transported to the ED via taxi. Eleven patients identified by EMS as meeting enrollment criteria refused study participation. The average time from taxi dispatch to ED triage was 43 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] = 38 to 48). Nine (10%) subjects transported by taxi were ultimately admitted to the hospital. None of the study participants required ED blood transfusions or emergent procedures or suffered an adverse event that could be directly attributed to the delay in ED arrival by taxi. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of EMS to safely triage patients who activate the 9-1-1 system to an alternative transport mechanism remains an unproven concept. Our study adds to the concerns of other published literature that EMS providers underestimate the potential severity of illness.",M1
19731152,"The availability and use of out-of-hospital physiologic information to identify high-risk injured children in a multisite, population-based cohort.OBJECTIVE: The validity of using adult physiologic criteria to triage injured children in the out-of-hospital setting remains unproven. Among children meeting adult field physiologic criteria, we assessed the availability of physiologic information, the incidence of death or prolonged hospitalization, and whether age-specific criteria would improve the specificity of the physiologic triage step. METHODS: We analyzed a prospective, out-of-hospital cohort of injured children aged &lt; or =14 years collected from December 2005 through February 2007 by 237 emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) agencies transporting to 207 acute care hospitals (trauma and nontrauma centers) in 11 sites across the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were standard adult physiologic values: systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; or =90 mmHg, respiratory rate &lt; 10 or &gt; 29 breaths/min, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &lt; or =12, and field intubation attempt. Seven physiologic variables (including age-specific values) and three demographic and mechanism variables were included in the analysis.  High-risk  children included those who died (field or in-hospital) or were hospitalized &gt; 2 days. The decision tree was derived and validated using binary recursive partitioning. RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-five children were included in the analysis, of whom 62 (6.5%) died and 117 (12.3%) were hospitalized &gt; 2 days. Missing values were common, ranging from 6% (respiratory rate) to 53% (pulse oximetry), and were associated with younger age and high-risk outcome. The final decision rule included four variables (assisted ventilation, GCS score &lt; 11, pulse oximetry &lt; 95%, and SBP &gt; 96 mmHg), which demonstrated improved specificity (71.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 66.7-76.6%]) at the expense of missing high-risk children (sensitivity 76.5% [95% CI 66.4-86.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of high-risk injured children meeting adult physiologic criteria is relatively low and the findings from this sample do not support using age-specific values to better identify such children. However, the amount and pattern of missing data may compromise the value and practical use of field physiologic information in pediatric triage.",M1
19730794,"[Central in-hospital emergency coordinator. Concept to optimize the interface between emergency medical services and hospitals]BACKGROUND: Although the prognosis of many diseases relies on timely diagnosis and treatment, the admission process of patients taken into hospitals by emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) is often affected by delays or rejection of patients. A smooth interaction between these two phases is critical for the prognosis in time-critical situations. The implementation of an in-hospital coordinating emergency physician (ZINK) responsible for the admission of EMS patients, a concept which was developed and introduced in our hospital, is suggested. CONCEPT: The ZINK represented by the most senior anaesthesiologist on duty is responsible for the registration of emergency patients from all departments under one telephone number, decides on admittance, alerts necessary resources and documents inquiries. RESULTS: After an initial three calls the ZINK is currently contacted on average 8 times per day and experiences the satisfaction of EMS personnel and EMS dispatch centers. The number of rejected emergency patients has decreased by over 80%. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a ZINK can optimize the process of hospital admission in emergency patients. This can decrease the legal risk of hospitals and improve the external representation. Hospitals should consider designating a ZINK.",M1
19709795,"Out-of hospital advanced life support with or without a physician: effects on quality of CPR and outcome.BACKGROUND: The presence of physicians is believed to facilitate optimal management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but has not been sufficiently documented. METHODS: Adult non-traumatic cardiac arrests treated by Oslo <e>EMS</e> between May 2003 and April 2008 were prospectively registered. Patients were categorized according to being treated by the physician-manned ambulance (PMA) or by regular paramedic-manned ambulances (non-PMA). Patient records and continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) with impedance signals were reviewed. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Resuscitation was attempted in 1128 cardiac arrests, of which 151 treated by non-PMA and PMA together were excluded from comparative analysis. Of the remaining 977 patients, 232 (24%) and 741 (76%) were treated by PMA and non-PMA, respectively. The PMA group was more likely to have bystander witnessed arrests and initial VF/VT, and received better CPR quality with shorter hands-off intervals and pre-shock pauses, and having a greater proportion of patients being intubated. Despite uneven distribution of positive prognostic factors and better CPR quality, short-term and long-term survival were not different for patients treated by the PMA vs. non-PMA, with 34% vs. 33% (p=0.74) achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 28% vs. 25% (p=0.50) being admitted to ICU and 13% vs. 11% (p=0.28) being discharged from hospital, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was not different for patients treated by the PMA and non-PMA in our EMS system.",M1

Our patient developed isolated, massive lingual swelling approximately 3 hours after the out-of-hospital placement of a laryngeal tube. Swelling resolved 2 days later in the ICU after fiberoptic-guided exchange of the laryngeal tube for an endotracheal tube. It is most likely that the observed swelling was due to obstruction of venous drainage from the tongue by the oropharyngeal balloon. Other etiologies for lingual swelling such as angioedema cannot be definitively ruled out but are less likely to have caused the patient's tongue engorgement.",M1
19691810,"The Canadian prehospital evidence-based protocols project: knowledge translation in emergency medical services care.OBJECTIVES: The principles of evidence-based medicine are applicable to all areas and professionals in health care. The care provided by paramedics in the prehospital setting is no exception. The Prehospital Evidence-based Protocols Project Online (PEP) is a repository of appraised research evidence that is applicable to interventions performed in the prehospital setting and is openly available online. This article describes the history, current status, and potential future of the project. METHODS: The primary objective of the PEP is to catalog and grade emergency medical services (<e>EMS</e>) studies with a level of evidence (LOE). Subsequently, each prehospital intervention is assigned a class of recommendation (COR) based on all the appraised articles on that intervention, in an effort to organize the evidence so it may be put into practice efficiently. An LOE is assigned to each article by the section editor, based on the study rigor and applicability to EMS. The section editor committee consists of EMS physicians and paramedics from across Canada, and two from Ireland and a paramedic coordinator. The evidence evaluation cycle is continuous; as the section editors send back appraisals, the coordinator updates the database and sends out another article for review. RESULTS: The database currently has 182 individual interventions organized under 103 protocols, with 933 citations. CONCLUSIONS: This project directly meets recent recommendations to improve EMS by using evidence to support interventions and incorporating it into protocols. Organizing and grading the evidence allows medical directors and paramedics to incorporate research findings into their daily practice. As such, this project demonstrates how knowledge translation can be conducted in EMS.",M1
20380715,"A rich TILLING resource for studying gene function in Brassica rapa.BACKGROUND: The Brassicaceae family includes the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as well as a number of agronomically important species such as oilseed crops (in particular Brassica napus, B. juncea and B. rapa) and vegetables (eg. B. rapa and B. oleracea). Separated by only 10-20 million years, Brassica species and Arabidopsis thaliana are closely related, and it is expected that knowledge obtained relating to Arabidopsis growth and development can be translated into Brassicas for crop improvement. Moreover, certain aspects of plant development are sufficiently different between Brassica and Arabidopsis to warrant studies to be carried out directly in the crop species. However, mutating individual genes in the amphidiploid Brassicas such as B. napus and B. juncea may, on the other hand, not give rise to expected phenotypes as the genomes of these species can contain up to six orthologues per single-copy Arabidopsis gene. In order to elucidate and possibly exploit the function of redundant genes for oilseed rape crop improvement, it may therefore be more efficient to study the effects in one of the diploid Brassica species such as B. rapa. Moreover, the ongoing sequencing of the B. rapa genome makes this species a highly attractive model for Brassica research and genetic resource development. RESULTS: Seeds from the diploid Brassica A genome species, B. rapa were treated with ethyl methane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) to produce a TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes) population for reverse genetics studies. We used the B. rapa genotype, R-o-18, which has a similar developmental ontogeny to an oilseed rape crop. Hence this resource is expected to be well suited for studying traits with relevance to yield and quality of oilseed rape. DNA was isolated from a total of 9,216 M2 plants and pooled to form the basis of the TILLING platform. Analysis of six genes revealed a high level of mutations with a density of about one per 60 kb. This analysis also demonstrated that screening a 1 kb amplicon in just one third of the population (3072 M2 plants) will provide an average of 68 mutations and a 97% probability of obtaining a stop-codon mutation resulting in a truncated protein. We furthermore calculated that each plant contains on average approximately 10,000 mutations and due to the large number of plants, it is predicted that mutations in approximately half of the GC base pairs in the genome exist within this population. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed the first EMS TILLING resource in the diploid Brassica species, B. rapa. The mutation density in this population is approximately 1 per 60 kb, which makes it the most densely mutated diploid organism for which a TILLING population has been published. This resource is publicly available through the RevGenUK reverse genetics platform http://revgenuk.jic.ac.uk.",M2
20371966,"Dose-response assessment of four genotoxic chemicals in a combined mouse and rat micronucleus (MN) and Comet assay protocol.The in vivo micronucleus (MN) assay has proven to be an effective measure of genotoxicity potential. However, sampling a single tissue (bone marrow) for a single indicator of genetic damage using the MN assay provides a limited genotoxicity profile. The in vivo alkaline (pH &gt;13) Comet assay, which detects a broad spectrum of DNA damage, can be applied to a variety of rodent tissues following administration of test agents. To determine if the Comet assay is a useful supplement to the in vivo MN assay, a combined test protocol (MN/Comet assay) was conducted in male B6C3F1 mice and F344/N rats using four model genotoxicants: ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), acrylamide (ACM), cyclophosphamide (CP), and vincristine sulfate (VS). Test compounds were administered on 4 consecutive days at 24-hr intervals (VS was administered to rats for 3 days); animals were euthanized 4 hr after the last administration. All compounds induced significant increases in micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) in the peripheral blood of mice, and all but ACM induced MN-RET in rats. EMS and ACM induced significant increases in DNA damage, measured by the Comet assay, in multiple tissues of mice and rats. CP-induced DNA damage was detected in leukocytes and duodenum cells. VS, a spindle fiber disrupting agent, was negative in the Comet assay. Based on these results, the MN/Comet assay holds promise for providing more comprehensive assessments of potential genotoxicants, and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is presently using this combined protocol in its overall evaluation of the genotoxicity of substances of public health concern.",M2
20102787,"Measurement of ethyl methanesulfonate in human plasma and breast milk samples using high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.Ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) is a mesylate ester, which is known to be a potent mutagen, teratogen, and possibly carcinogen. Mesylate esters have been found in pharmaceuticals as contaminants formed during the manufacturing process and may potentially pose an exposure hazard to humans. We have developed and validated a method for detection of trace amounts (ng/ml levels) of EMS in human plasma and breast milk. The samples were extracted by matrix solid-phase dispersion with ethyl acetate using Hydromatrix and the ASE 200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor. The extracts were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a HILIC column. The detection was performed with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantum Ultra, Thermo Electron Corporation) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in negative-ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring. The use of a surrogate internal standard in combination with HPLC-MS/MS provided a high degree of accuracy and precision. The extraction efficiency was greater than 70%. Repeated analyses of plasma and breast milk samples spiked with high (100 ng/ml), medium (50 ng/ml) and low (5 ng/ml) concentrations of the analytes gave relative standard deviations of less than 12%. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.5-0.9 ng/ml for both matrices.",M2
20003424,"A high-density collection of <e>EMS</e>-induced mutations for TILLING in Landsberg erecta genetic background of Arabidopsis.BACKGROUND: Arabidopsis thaliana is the main model species for plant molecular genetics studies and world-wide efforts are devoted to identify the function of all its genes. To this end, reverse genetics by TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) in a permanent collection of chemically induced mutants is providing a unique resource in Columbia genetic background. In this work, we aim to extend TILLING resources available in A. thaliana by developing a new population of ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) induced mutants in the second commonest reference strain. In addition, we pursue to saturate the number of EMS induced mutations that can be tolerated by viable and fertile plants. RESULTS: By mutagenizing with different EMS concentrations we have developed a permanent collection of 3712 M2/M3 independent mutant lines in the reference strain Landsberg erecta (Ler) of A. thaliana. This population has been named as the Arabidopsis TILLer collection. The frequency of mutations per line was maximized by using M1 plants with low but sufficient seed fertility. Application of TILLING to search for mutants in 14 genes identified 21 to 46 mutations per gene, which correspond to a total of 450 mutations. Missense mutations were found for all genes while truncations were selected for all except one. We estimated that, on average, these lines carry one mutation every 89 kb, Ler population providing a total of more than five million induced mutations. It is estimated that TILLer collection shows a two to three fold higher EMS mutation density per individual than previously reported A. thaliana population. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of TILLer collection demonstrates its usefulness for large scale TILLING reverse genetics in another reference genetic background of A. thaliana.

In a first set of experiments, root cells in planta were treated with Al at high concentrations (200-800 microM) for 3 h without or with pre-treatments of dihydroxybenzene disulphonic acid (Tiron) and dimethylthiourea (DMTU) for 2 h that trap O(2)(.-)and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), respectively. At the end of treatments, generation of O(2)(.-) and H(2)O(2), cell death and DNA damage were determined. In a second set of experiments, root cells in planta were conditioned by Al at low concentrations (5 or 10 microM) for 2 h and after a 2 h intertreatment interval challenged by MMCl or EMS for 3 h without or with a pre-treatment of Tiron or DMTU. Conditioning treatments, in addition, included two oxidative agents viz rose bengal and H(2)O(2) for comparison. Following treatments, root cells in planta were allowed to recover in tap water. Genotoxicity and DNA damage were evaluated by micronucleus (MN), chromosome aberration (CA) or spindle aberration (SA) and comet assays at different hours (0-30 h) of recovery. The results demonstrated that whereas Al at high concentrations induced DNA damage and cell death, in low concentrations induced adaptive response conferring genomic protection from genotoxic challenge imposed by MMCl, EMS and Al. Pre-treatments of Tiron and DMTU prevented Al-induced DNA damage, cell death, as well as genotoxic adaptation to MMCl and EMS, significantly. The findings underscored the biphasic (hormetic) mode of action of Al that at high doses induced DNA damage and at low non-toxic doses conferred genomic protection, both of which were mediated through ROI but perhaps involving different networks.",M2
19883257,"Ethyl methanesulphonate in a parenteral formulation of BMS-214662 mesylate, a selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor: formation and rate of hydrolysis.The objectives of the present study were to investigate the formation and rate of hydrolysis of ethyl methanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) in BMS-214662 mesylate drug substance and parenteral formulation by a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method. EMS levels in the drug substance ranged between 0.3 microg/g and 0.8 microg/g. The parenteral formulation contains ethanol and the reaction between residual free methane sulphonic acid and ethanol may lead to the formation of EMS. Given that EMS is a potent mutagen, it is therefore of vital importance to eliminate or reduce the risk of human exposure. Data indicate no significant increase in the levels of EMS following storage of the drug product for 18 weeks at 25 degrees C or six weeks at 60 degrees C indicating that the potential reaction between ethanol and free methane sulphonic acid may not occur in the BMS-214662 formulation under the storage conditions evaluated and therefore causes no plausible safety concerns of EMS exposure in humans. Kinetic studies were conducted by spiking 200 ppb of EMS into water and the diluted and undiluted parenteral formulation. The rates of hydrolysis of EMS at 25 degrees C followed pseudo-first order kinetics and were determined to be 2.35 x 10(-4)min(-1), 67.4 x 10(-4)min(-1), and 1.32 x 10(-4)min(-1) in water, undiluted, and diluted drug product, respectively.",M2

It also presents an outlook on the nature of additional research building upon the Viracept-EMS case to test assumptions underlying thresholded dose-response relationships and to establish biologically based risk assessment models in lieu of default models for DNA-reactive compounds.",M2
19857798,"Considerations regarding a permitted daily exposure calculation for ethyl methanesulfonate.Specification of human exposure limits to compounds with toxicities based on modes of action that allow considerations of a threshold and the safe estimation of a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) is normally based on acceptable daily intake (ADI) or permitted daily exposure (PDE) calculations using appropriate safety factors to account for differences between species, populations, length of observation and severity of lesions. In view of the reliable experimental evidence for a thresholded dose response of the genotoxicity of ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) as reported in this special issue of Toxicology Letters such an acceptable daily intake proposal is made using the approach for setting permitted daily exposure limits outlined in appendix 3 of the ICH Q3C consensus guideline on residual solvents in pharmaceuticals (ICH, 2005). Up to now the specification of EMS exposure limits was based on the generic threshold of toxicological concern (TTC)-derived limit of 1.5mug/person/day as advocated by the CHMP [CHMP, 2006. Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities. www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/swp/519902en.pdf (June 28, 2006) with Q&amp;A www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/swp/43199407en.pdf (June 25, 2008)] or on as low as technically achievable criteria. Such limits have been based on conservative linear dose-effect extrapolations corresponding to an excess cancer risk of 1 in 100,000. We now present an EMS-specific PDE based on the reliable demonstration of a NOEL for induction of mutations in vivo of 25mg/kg/day. Using the most conservative safety factors described in ICH Q3C we derive a PDE of approximately 100 microg/person/day using product safety factors still amounting to 12,000.",M2
19857797,"In vivo genotoxicity of <e>EMS</e>: statistical assessment of the dose response curves.EMS induced micronuclei and lacZ mutations in in vivo studies in mice with a clearly sublinear dose dependency. As reported elsewhere in this issue, NOEL dose values of between 25 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day were observed for the different endpoints and tissues analysed. Here we show that statistical assessment of the data provides solid support that the induction of mutagenic and clastogenic effects after in vivo treatment with the directly DNA damaging mutagen EMS adheres to a thresholded dose response relation. These data corroborate similar evidence obtained in in vitro studies. We conclude that cells are fully capable of repairing large amounts of DNA ethylations induced by EMS without experiencing elevated mutation frequencies. The stochastic, linear risk assessment model generally employed for DNA damaging genotoxins can therefore be refuted for EMS. While presently this conclusion cannot be generalized to other genotoxins a change of paradigm appears to be indicated at least for alkylating agents inducing a comparable type and spectrum of DNA lesions as EMS.",M2
19857796,"Literature review on the genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity of ethyl methanesulfonate.In order to assess the risk of patients being exposed to an anti-AIDS medication contaminated with <e>EMS</e> we have performed in depth genotoxicity, general toxicity and DMPK investigations. The results of these studies are reported in the accompanying papers of this issue. Prior to starting our investigations we searched the literature for toxicity data on this well established mutagen with specific attention to dose-response relations in in vivo genotoxicity studies, since, obviously, in vivo data are pivotal for risk assessment. There are numerous published in vivo genotoxicity studies on EMS, with generally 50mg/kg - or higher - being the minimal dose used. The dose of 50mg/kg induced effects in some, but not all studies, while the dose of 100mg/kg was clearly positive in most studies, except for heritable mutations where a single dose of 100mg/kg was not observed to induce measurable effects in post-meiotic stages and even the maximal dose of 250 mg/kg was negative in pre-meiotic stages of male germ cell development. For somatic cells, NOEL values could not be derived for any of the endpoints studied. Although a large number of genotoxicity studies are available, none of the studies was sufficiently detailed to allow unambiguous conclusions about the presence of a (practical) threshold. But in most cases the dose-responses show a sublinear relationship (i.e. the slope increases with dose) which indicates that the data would not be incompatible with a threshold dose-response relationship. This stands in contrast to data on ethylnitrosourea (ENU) which has been studied concommittantly with EMS in several in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity investigations. ENU generally appeared to induce genotoxic effects with linear dose relationships. We also review the more limited data reported on teratogenicity and carcinogenicity of EMS. Induction of fetal malformations in mice appeared to have a NOEL of 100mg/kg. Classical life-time carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with EMS. Induction of mammary, lung, kidney, brain, and liver tumors has been observed after various short term treatment regimes. In none of the published studies a no effect level was reported and no exposure data are available. Overall, the experimental data do not fully characterize the carcinogenic potential of EMS and are insufficient for a risk extrapolation to humans. Although the data on teratogenicity and carcinogenicity are insufficient for assessing dose-response relations it is generally accepted that the genotoxic property of EMS is at the base of the teratogenic and carcinogenic effects.",M2

Root cause analysis performed and corrective actions implemented are presented. Using the decay rate of ethyl methane sulfonate in Viracept film coated tablets 250 mg at 25 degrees C derived from stability studies, establishing of the worst case scenario for patient exposure to ethyl methane sulfonate, is outlined. Whereas the first evaluation based on ethyl methane sulfonate levels found in the drug substance suggested a worst case patient exposure of 2300 ppm, the decay rate of ethyl methane sulfonate in the drug product and the time gap between drug product manufacture and earliest possible use by patients led to the conclusion that 920 ppm (+/-10%) over a period of approx. 90 days is a reasonably cautious assumption for the worst case patient exposure scenario.",M2
19857794,"<e>EMS</e> in Viracept--the course of events in 2007 and 2008 from the non-clinical safety point of view.Viracept (nelfinavir) is an HIV protease inhibitor supplied by Roche outside the US, Canada and Japan. Viracept was first introduced by Roche in 1998. Although newer protease inhibitors have become available for the treatment of HIV, it is viewed as a useful medicine for patients who are intolerant to ritonavir (since it does not require ritonavir boosting), pregnant women, and patients in resource-limited settings, since the formulation is heat-stable and does not require refrigeration. The relatively high prevalence of HIV in some of the third world countries means that it was also a product of choice for young women of childbearing age, pregnant and nursing women and young children. On 18 May 2007 F. Hoffmann-La Roche received first reports of a  bad smell  of blisterpacked Viracept tablets and one adverse drug report of nausea and vomiting from patients in Spain. Subsequently, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), an established mutagen, carcinogen and teratogen was identified as the potential source of the bad smell. On 6 June 2007, Viracept was globally recalled as the extent of the contamination exceeded the guidances for permissible levels set by regulatory authorities by more than 1000-fold and hence human risk was not readily assessable. In the following, a compilation of the course of events from a non-clinical point of view is presented. This compilation only partially reflects the complexity of the case and the interactions between all parties between May/June 2007 and September 2008 and hence necessarily remains partly a subjective compilation of the authors of this article. This compilation serves also as an introduction into this Special Issue of Toxicology Letters. The data on the cause and levels of contamination, likely duration of intake and affected patient population can be found in the subsequent contributions. Most importantly, we share in other parts of this Special Issue with the scientific community the data and risk assessment arguments that supported the conclusion by the company and regulatory authorities that the levels of contamination with EMS posed no health risk to affected patients.",M2
19802748,"Genetic analysis and gene mapping of a new rolled-leaf mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.).To understand the development of rice leaf blades, we identified a new rolled-leaf mutant, w32, from indica cultivar IR64 through <e>EMS</e> mutagenesis. The mutant showed a stable rolled-leaf phenotype throughout the life cycle. Two F2 populations were developed by crossing w32 to cultivar IR24 and PA64. Genetic analysis showed that the rolled-leaf phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene. To determine the location of the gene, bulked segregant analysis was carried out using mutant and wild-type DNA pools and 1846 mutant-type F2 individuals derived from the cross w32/PA64 were genotyped to locate the gene on the short arm of chromosome 7. The rolled-leaf gene, tentatively named rl11(t), is likely a new gene as no other rolled-leaf genes have been identified near the region. By developing new SSR and InDel markers, the gene was delimited to a 52 kb region near the end of the short chromosome arm. Further fine mapping and cloning of the gene are currently underway.",M2
19797863,"Multi-endpoint genotoxic assay using L5178Y (Tk(+/-) -3.7.2c) cells.When the mouse lymphoma Tk assay (MLA) provides a positive result, its cause can be roughly estimated by examining colony sizes. An increase in the number of large colonies means that the compound tested has point mutational potential, while an increase in small colonies indicates the potential for chromosome aberration. However, it was found to be difficult to clearly judge this in the case of caffeine known as a clastogen lacking the potential of point mutation. In our study, caffeine significantly increased the thymidine kinase (Tk) mutation frequencies derived from large colonies as well as those from small colonies in the standard protocol, although the frequencies derived from a small colony were higher than those from large colonies at higher doses. Therefore, we prolonged the expression period from 2 days, a standard period, to 6 days after treatment and then examined the Tk and Hprt mutations simultaneously. The result showed that caffeine gave a completely negative result on a mutation test for both Tk and Hprt. On the other hand, ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), a genotoxic carcinogen, showed a positive result for both. Moreover, caffeine and EMS significantly increased the frequencies of micronucleated cells. In conclusion, when MLA gives a positive result and the cause is ambiguous, in order to identify the exact cause of the positive response, it is helpful to perform a confirmatory test investigating the potential of Tk and Hprt gene mutation simultaneously after 6-day expression and to perform an in vitro micronucleus assay during the expression period.",M2

19752217,"In planta mutagenesis determines the functional regions of the wheat puroindoline proteins.In planta analysis of protein function in a crop plant could lead to improvements in understanding protein structure/function relationships as well as selective agronomic or end product quality improvements. The requirements for successful in planta analysis are a high mutation rate, an efficient screening method, and a trait with high heritability. Two ideal targets for functional analysis are the Puroindoline a and Puroindoline b (Pina and Pinb, respectively) genes, which together compose the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Ha locus that controls grain texture and many wheat end-use properties. Puroindolines (PINs) together impart soft texture, and mutations in either PIN result in hard seed texture. Studies of the PINs' mode of action are limited by low allelic variation. To create new Pin alleles and identify critical function-determining regions, Pin point mutations were created in planta via <e>EMS</e> treatment of a soft wheat. Grain hardness of 46 unique PIN missense alleles was then measured using segregating F(2):F(3) populations. The impact of individual missense alleles upon PIN function, as measured by grain hardness, ranged from neutral (74%) to intermediate to function abolishing. The percentage of function-abolishing mutations among mutations occurring in both PINA and PINB was higher for PINB, indicating that PINB is more critical to overall Ha function. This is contrary to expectations in that PINB is not as well conserved as PINA. All function-abolishing mutations resulted from structure-disrupting mutations or from missense mutations occurring near the Tryptophan-rich region. This study demonstrates the feasibility of in planta functional analysis of wheat proteins and that the Tryptophan-rich region is the most important region of both PINA and PINB.",M2

The mutant strains Af-UV-5.3 and Af-Ch-5.7 exhibited 79 and 110% more enzyme activity than the native strain A. flavus FCBP-231. This improvement in enzyme activity of the mutants suggests that they are suitable strains to be used in biotechnology. RAPD-PCR analysis revealed different patterns of amplicons of native as well as mutant derivatives, which suggested that the mutation imparted changes in the genetic make up of the mutants probably involved enzyme production control.",M2
19695319,"The Viracept (nelfinavir)--ethyl methanesulfonate case: a threshold risk assessment for human exposure to a genotoxic drug contamination?In May 2007, the F. Hoffmann-La Roche Company became aware of a contamination of Viracept (nelfinavir) tablets by the mutagenic DNA-ethylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) as a result of a production incident. HIV-patients could have been exposed for 3 months to daily doses of up to 2.75 mg EMS, i.e., about 50 microg/kg per day. In this special issue, 12 manuscripts have been assembled to provide comprehensive insight in what happened and how the incident was managed by Roche and handled by the regulatory agencies. In the first four papers, the course of events and the toxicological information available at the outset are summarized and a traditional cancer risk assessment on the basis of a linear default dose-response is made. Three articles then report on the experiments performed for an improved risk assessment. A standard 4-week toxicity study with EMS in the rat indicated an NOAEL of 20mg/kg per day. Extensive studies on the genotoxicity showed threshold-like dose responses for both chromosome damage (bone marrow micronucleus test) and gene mutation (lacZ transgenic MutaMouse test) in various organs of mice treated for up to 4 weeks, whereas ethylation of hemoglobin at the N-terminal valine increased linearly with dose. The difference between adduct formation in DNA and protein was interpreted by repair of DNA adducts that becomes saturated above a threshold concentration of EMS, regarded as the metrics for the rate of DNA ethylation. Elaborate toxicokinetic investigations in various animal species, coupled to appropriate modeling, were performed in order to extrapolate the animal data to humans. Using a threshold risk assessment based on estimated c(max) of EMS, a safety factor of 370 was derived for maximum doses ingested by Viracept patients. A number of critical points are addressed in this editorial, concerning (i) definitions and types of  thresholds , (ii) estimation of a confidence limit for a slope below the threshold dose, interpreted as an increment within background variation, (iii) implementation for other mutagens and for human risk assessment.",M2
19695316,"Modelling of patient <e>EMS</e> exposure: translating pharmacokinetics of EMS in vitro and in animals into patients.In order to support the toxicological risk assessment for the ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) exposure of patients ingesting contaminated Viracept tablets (Müller and Singer, 2009), there was a need to correlate the effects observed in in vivo genotoxicity studies with mice to EMS exposure and to estimate human exposure to EMS at the level of contamination of Viracept tablets. The species differences in volume of distribution of EMS, a key factor for determination of its C(max), were small in the species investigated (mouse, rat, monkey), the species differences in clearance, the key factor involved in AUC assessment, were large (Lavé et al., 2009). Because of this uncertainty in extrapolation of clearance across species we used a conservative approach for human exposure predictions in terms of AUC where clearance was assumed to solely reflect the chemical stability of EMS neglecting additional clearance pathways such as metabolism and exhalation. This approach was compared to the estimates obtained from allometric scaling based on rat clearance, the species leading to the lowest clearance predicted in man. We found that both approaches led to nearly identical predictions of the human AUC. Thus, we predict a human AUC of 13 microM h for patients ingesting the most contaminated Viracept tablets, corresponding to a maximal daily intake of 0.055 mg/kg of EMS. The C(max) of EMS in these patients is predicted to be 0.85 microM. In order to provide a basis for toxicological risk assessment, these maximal human AUC and C(max) values are to be compared to the AUC and C(max) values in mice at the EMS dose of 25mg/kg which was found to be the threshold dose for induction of mutagenic effects, i.e. the dose at which no mutagenic effects were observed (Gocke et al., 2009-a). We calculate AUC and C(max) in mice at the threshold dose to be 350 microM h and 315 microM, respectively. Thus we conclude that a large safety factor can be deduced, whatever the basis of comparison, as is discussed in detail by Müller et al. (2009).",M2
19695315,"In vivo and in vitro characterization of ethyl methanesulfonate pharmacokinetics in animals and in human.Pharmacokinetics of ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) were characterized in mice, rats and in cynomolgus monkeys with unlabelled and (14)C-radiolabelled EMS by either quantification of unchanged EMS or the N-ethyl-valine haemoglobin (Hb) adduct. EMS was well absorbed and exhibited close to 100% oral bioavailability. EMS showed some species differences in systemic clearance (intermediate in mice, low in rats and monkeys) representing only 1-4% of the cardiac output. The volume of distribution (0.5-0.8L/kg) was constant across species and corresponded to extracellular water. As a result of the species differences in clearance, the half-life ranged from 10 min in mouse (at low dose) to 5h in monkey. The systemic exposure of free EMS and the levels of its Hb adduct increased nearly dose proportionately from 1 to 5 and 0.5 to 80 mg/kg, respectively. The persistence of the N-ethyl-valine Hb adduct was much longer than EMS itself, consistent with the long life span of haemoglobin. No species differences were evident for the binding of EMS to Hb in whole blood ex vivo as determined by the second order rate constants. Following administration of Viracept tablets of the contaminated production batches (to monkeys leading to EMS doses of 0.08-27 microg/kg, concentrations of ethyl-valine Hb adducts) were near or below the detection limit of the assay (0.043 nmol/g Hb).",M2
19463836,"<e>EMS</e> mutant spectra generated by multi-parameter flow cytometry.The CHO A(L) cell line contains a single copy of human chromosome 11 that encodes several cell surface proteins including glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linked CD59 and CD90, as well as CD98, CD44 and CD151 which are not GPI-linked. The flow cytometry mutation assay (FCMA) measures mutations of the CD59 gene by the absence of fluorescence when stained with antibodies against the CD59 cell surface protein. We have measured simultaneous mutations in CD59, CD44, CD90, CD98 and CD151 to generate a mutant spectrum for ionizing radiation. After treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) many cells have an intermediate level of CD59 staining. Single cells were sorted from CD59(-) regions with varying levels of fluorescence and the resulting clonal populations had a stable phenotype for CD59 expression. Mutant spectra were generated by flow cytometry using the isolated clones and nearly all clones were mutated in CD59 only. Interestingly, about 60% of the CD59 negative clones were actually GPI mutants determined by staining with the GPI specific fluorescently labeled bacterial toxin aerolysin (FLAER). The GPI negative cells are most likely caused by mutations in the X-linked pigA gene important in GPI biosynthesis. Small mutations of pigA and CD59 were expected for the alkylating agent EMS and the resulting spectra are significantly different than the large deletions found when analyzing radiation mutants. After analyzing the CD59(-) clonal populations we have adjusted the FCMA mutant regions from 1% to 10% of the mean of the CD59 positive peak to include the majority of CD59 mutants.",M2
19446969,"MNT and MutaMouse studies to define the in vivo dose response relations of the genotoxicity of <e>EMS</e> and ENU.Although there are a multitude of in vitro and in vivo studies on the genotoxic activity of EMS, no lifetime carcinogenicity studies, repeat dose mutation data or exposure analysis are available to serve as a solid basis for risk assessment for human exposure cases. The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether a threshold for mutagenic and clastogenic activity in vivo could be established, using the bone marrow micronucleus (MNT) and MutaMouse test systems, in the hope to provide reassurance to the patients that their accidental exposure to EMS at doses up to 0.055 mg/kg did not carry a toxicological risk. Dose levels ranging from 1.25 to 260 mg/kg/day were applied orally for up to 28 days. As a reference we included ENU at doses of 1.1-22 mg/kg/day. Our studies showed that daily doses of up to 25mg/kg/day (bone marrow, GI tract) and 50 mg/kg/day (liver) did not induce mutations in the lacZ gene in the three organs tested. Doses up to 80mg/kg/day (7-day dosing regime) did not induce micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. The genotoxic activity of EMS became apparent only at higher dose levels. Dose fractionation of EMS (28 times 12.5mg/kg versus a single high dose 350 mg/kg) provided further evidence for the thresholded dose response of EMS and showed that no cumulation of gene mutations below a threshold was occurring. In contrast, for ENU no threshold was apparent and dose fractionation indicated full additivity of individual dose effects.",M2
19443141,"Ethyl methanesulfonate toxicity in Viracept--a comprehensive human risk assessment based on threshold data for genotoxicity.Based on a production accident Viracept (nelfinavir mesilate) tablets, an HIV protease inhibitor supplied by Roche outside the US, Canada and Japan was contaminated with relatively high levels of ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) for at most 3 months in spring of 2007. On the basis of a wide variety of toxicological data including critical experiments for mutation induction under chronic exposure conditions and cross-species exposure scaling experiments to extrapolate to humans, we estimate the added risk of adverse effects (cancer, birth abnormalities, heritable defects) in any individual patient accidentally exposed to EMS via contaminated Viracept tablets in the context of this production accident as essentially zero. Of critical important for this risk assessment are pivotal in vivo genotoxicity studies (MNT, MutaMouse) providing evidence for 'hockey-stick', like dose-response relationships for the risk defining induction of gene mutations and chromosomal damage by EMS [Gocke, E., Müller, L., Pfister, T., Buergin, H., 2009a. Literature review on the genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity of ethyl methanesulfonate. Toxicol. Lett.; Gocke, E., Müller, L., Pfister, T., 2009b. EMS in Viracept-initial ('traditional') assessment of risk to patients based on linear dose response relations. Toxicol. Lett.; Gocke, E., Müller, L., Ballantyne, M., Whitwell, J., Müller, L., 2009c. MNT and MutaMouse studies to definde the in vivo dose-response relations of the genotoxicity of EMS and ENU. Toxicol. Lett.]. As outlined in Gocke and Wall [Gocke, E., Wall, M., 2009. In vivo genotoxicity of EMS: Statistical assessment of the dose response curves. Toxicol. Lett.], several statistical approaches are in support of a threshold model to best fit the data. The presence of clear no effect levels in bone marrow, liver and GI-tract tissue with several dose levels tested below the NOEL permits the calculation of safety factors with considerable confidence. In calculating the ratio of the NOEL dose in the animal studies (25mg/kg/day) divided by the calculated maximal daily dose of the patients (1068ppm EMS in 2.92g Viracept tablets=2.75mg EMS or 0.055mg/kg for a 50kg person) we derive a safety factor of 454 based on oral intake. Detailed absorption, distribution and metabolism studies in mice, rats and monkeys and with human surrogates in vitro enable us to estimate the safety factors also for the calculated likely highest exposure (AUC and C(max)) of patients to EMS [Lave, T., Birnböck, H., Götschi, A., Ramp, T., Pähler, A., 2009a. In vivo and in vitro characterization of ethyl methanesulfonate pharmacokinetics in animals and in human. Toxicol. Lett.; Lave, T., Paehler, A., Grimm, H.P., 2009b. Modelling of patient EMS exposure: translating pharmacokinetics of EMS in vitro and in animals into patients. Toxicol. Lett.]. We calculate the total exposure (AUC) based safety factor to amount to at least 28. This lower value is due to the conservative prediction of a longer half-life of EMS in man versus mouse, rat and monkey. Based on the estimated human C(max) the safety factor for affected Viracept patients is calculated to be 370, as C(max) is mainly dependent on volume of distribution, which is not much different for EMS in different species. We consider that the total exposure based safety factor constitutes a minimal value since the considerations regarding evidence of error-free repair at sub-threshold concentrations argues in favor of using the highest EMS concentration (C(max)) rather than the AUC as basis for risk assessment. The 'true value' very likely lies somewhere between these two numbers as aspects such as repair enzyme availability and status of the cell cycle relative to the insult are important parameters that may not fully support safety factors based solely on C(max) estimates. Potential adverse effects of EMS such as cancer, birth abnormalities and heritable effects are considered to be sequelae of its genotoxic activity. Hence, the thresholded dose-response relationships should also apply to these endpoints. We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the specific disease situation of the HIV infected target population and potential influences of co-medications on the susceptibilities and repair capacities of EMS induced DNA lesions.",M2

Treatment with EMS had a direct dose-dependent effect on food consumption and consequently on body weight at doses &gt; or =20mg/kgbw/day in male rats and at &gt; or =60 mg/kgbw/day in females rats. Hence, treatment with the high dose of 180 mg/kgbw/day had to be interrupted for 9 days after which, the animals were re-dosed at 120 mg/kgbw/day. This dose was also poorly tolerated over the remaining two treatment weeks causing again a marked reduction in food consumption and body weight. A dose of 60 mg/kgbw/day was moderately tolerated over 4 weeks treatment with mean daily food consumption and body weight distinctly lower than in controls. Primary targets of systemic toxicity were the hematopoietic system, thymolymphatic system and sexual organs. Characteristic changes in hematology parameters were decreased red blood cell counts, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration. White blood cell counts were also decreased due to reduced lymphocyte and granulocyte populations of each fraction. The corresponding histopathology findings were fatty atrophy of bone marrow and minimal hypocellularity of the white pulp of the spleen. Similarly, treatment with EMS caused an involution of the thymolymphatic system characterized by decreased organ weight of thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen microscopically associated with atrophy of the thymus and hypocellularity of Peyer's patches, lymph nodes and the white pulp of the spleen. The effects on sexual organs included lower organ weight/reduced size for testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, prostate, and uterus. Tubular atrophy, single cell necrosis of the germ cells and in epididymides reduced spermatozoa were recorded microscopically. The described findings occurred at doses of 60 and 180/120 mg/kgbw/day and were dose-dependent with regard to incidence and severity. Other target organs were the pancreas (acinar cell vacuolation), thyroid gland (follicular cell hypertrophy), and salivary gland (secretory depletion of convoluted ducts). The systemic exposure to EMS was monitored by hemoglobin ethylvaline adduct measurement. The concentration of hemoglobin ethylvaline adducts was linear with the dose and accumulated 11-26-fold over the treatment period. In summary, decreases in food consumption and body weight were the dose-limiting effects of treatment with EMS. Organ toxicity was characterized by depression of cell proliferation (hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis) and changes suggestive of reduced metabolism and/or physiological imbalances (e.g. thymolymphatic system and thyroid gland) without signs of inflammatory or necrotic lesions. For some findings, especially the effects on the thymolymphatic system and sexual organs, it cannot be excluded that starvation-like condition contributed to the occurrence of such changes. The low dose of 20 mg/kgbw/day was basically free of adverse effects despite of a clear evidence for hemoglobin adducts.",M2

We estimated that maximal lifetime cancer risk was in the order of 10(-3) (for lifetime ingestion of the maximally contaminated tablets) or 10(-4) for the exposure lasting for 3 months. This estimate was based on a lifetime cancer study with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; as insufficient data were available for EMS) in rodents and default linear back extrapolation. Analogous estimates were made specifically for breast cancer based on short term tumorigenicity studies with EMS in rats, for the induction of heritable mutations based on specific locus and dominant lethal tests in mice and for the induction of birth defects based on teratogenicity studies in mice. We concluded that even under worst case assumptions of linear dose relations the chance of experiencing these adverse effects would be very small, comprising at most a minute additional burden among the background incidence of the patients.",M2
19407984,"Scarlet-Rz1, an <e>EMS</e>-generated hexaploid wheat with tolerance to the soilborne necrotrophic pathogens Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 and R. oryzae.The necrotrophic root pathogens Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 and R. oryzae cause Rhizoctonia root rot and damping-off, yield-limiting diseases that pose barriers to the adoption of conservation tillage in wheat production systems. Existing control practices are only partially effective, and natural genetic resistance to Rhizoctonia has not been identified in wheat or its close relatives. We report the first genetic resistance/tolerance to R. solani AG-8 and R. oryzae in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) germplasm 'Scarlet-Rz1'. Scarlet-Rz1 was derived from the allohexaploid spring wheat cultivar Scarlet using EMS mutagenesis. Tolerant seedlings displayed substantial root and shoot growth after 14 days in the presence of 100-400 propagules per gram soil of R. solani AG-8 and R. oryzae in greenhouse assays. BC(2)F(4) individuals of Scarlet-Rz1 showed a high and consistent degree of tolerance. Seedling tolerance was transmissible and appeared to be dominant or co-dominant. Scarlet-Rz1 is a promising genetic resource for developing Rhizoctonia-tolerant wheat cultivars because the tolerance trait immediately can be deployed into wheat breeding germplasm through cross-hybridization, thereby avoiding difficulties with transfer from secondary or tertiary relatives as well as constraints associated with genetically modified plants. Our findings also demonstrate the utility of chemical mutagenesis for generating tolerance to necrotrophic pathogens in allohexaploid wheat.",M2

(Rutaceae) fruit peel oil (CPO) in combination with mutagenic metals and alkylating agents were studied using the wing spot test of D. melanogaster. The four reference mutagens, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), cobalt chloride (CoCl2), ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) were clearly genotoxic. CPO alone at doses from 0.1 to 0.5% in Tween 80 was not mutagenic and did not enhance the mutagenic effect of the reference mutagens. However, antigenotoxic effects of CPO were clearly demonstrated in chronic cotreatments with mutagens and oil, by a significant decrease in wing spots induced by all four mutagens. The D. melanogaster wing spot test was found to be a suitable assay for detecting antigenotoxic effects in vivo.",M2
19307605,"Identification of <e>EMS</e>-induced mutations in Drosophila melanogaster by whole-genome sequencing.Next-generation methods for rapid whole-genome sequencing enable the identification of single-base-pair mutations in Drosophila by comparing a chromosome bearing a new mutation to the unmutagenized sequence. To validate this approach, we sought to identify the molecular lesion responsible for a recessive EMS-induced mutation affecting egg shell morphology by using Illumina next-generation sequencing. After obtaining sufficient sequence from larvae that were homozygous for either wild-type or mutant chromosomes, we obtained high-quality reads for base pairs composing approximately 70% of the third chromosome of both DNA samples. We verified 103 single-base-pair changes between the two chromosomes. Nine changes were nonsynonymous mutations and two were nonsense mutations. One nonsense mutation was in a gene, encore, whose mutations produce an egg shell phenotype also observed in progeny of homozygous mutant mothers. Complementation analysis revealed that the chromosome carried a new functional allele of encore, demonstrating that one round of next-generation sequencing can identify the causative lesion for a phenotype of interest. This new method of whole-genome sequencing represents great promise for mutant mapping in flies, potentially replacing conventional methods.",M2
19291804,"Kinetics of CHO A L mutant expression after treatment with gamma radiation, <e>EMS</e>, and asbestos.The flow cytometry mutation assay (FCMA) uses hybrid CHO A(L) cells to measure mutations of the cd59 gene located on human chromosome 11 by the absence of fluorochrome-conjugated antibody binding to the CD59 surface antigen. Mutant expression peaks between 6 and 12 days, then decreases to a stable plateau, instead of a constant mutant fraction obtained by clonogenic assays. To evaluate this variable mutant expression time, cells were treated with radiation, EMS or asbestos and cell proliferation and survival were measured at times leading up to peak mutant expression. Potential doubling time (T(pot)) values increased by at least 75% for each agent by 3 h after treatment but returned to control levels after only 3 days. Survival returned to 90% of control within a week, close to the peak expression day for all three agents. The survival of CD59(-) cells sorted on the peak day of expression was roughly half that of CD59(+) cells. Cloned EMS-treated CD59(-) cells had a doubling time of 16.7 vs. 14.1 h for CD59(+) cells. Triple mutants (CD59(-)/CD44(-)/CD90(-)) were preferentially lost from the population over time, while the proportion of CD59(-)/CD90(-) mutants increased. In conclusion, the peak day of mutant expression occurs only when cells recover from the toxic effects of the mutagen. A fraction of cells originally quantified as mutants are lost over time due to lethal deletions and slower growth.",M2
19289278,"Kinetics of an extracellular exo-inulinase production from a 5-flourocytosine resistant mutant of Geotrichum candidum using two-factorial design.In the present study, eight different strains of Geotrichum candidum were isolated and screened for an extracellular exo-inulinase production using chemically enriched sucrose-mineral media. The isolate (Zool-3i) with a better enzyme activity (1.38 IU/ml) was subjected to induced mutagenesis using methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and a mutant with an enzyme activity of 32.06 IU/ml was obtained. Further exposure to ethyl methane sulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) and ultraviolet (UV) radiations yielded a mutant exhibiting an improved activity of 39.34 IU/ml. The potential mutant was cultured overnight and plated on 5fc-YPR agar medium and thus made resistant against 5-flourocytocine. Over 50-fold enhancement in enzyme production (71.85 IU/ml) was achieved when the process parameters including incubation period (48 h), sucrose concentration (5.0 g/L), pH (6.0), inoculum size (2.0%, 16 h old) and urea (0.2%) were identified using Plackett-Burman design. On the basis of kinetic variables, notably Q(p) (0.723 U/g/h), Y(p/s) (2.036U/g) and q(p) (0.091U/g cells/h), the mutant MEU-5fc-6 was found to be a hyper producer of exo-inulinase (HS, LSD 0.045, p&lt; or =0.05).",M2
19266326,"Mutagenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells with ethylmethanesulfonate.Unraveling the function of the mammalian genome relies heavily on analyses of the laboratory mouse. Because of its powerful genetics and available technologies to manipulate the genome, plus its developmental and physiological similarities to humans, it has become a goal to generate mutations in all mouse genes and analyze the phenotypic consequences. Gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells is the method of choice for making null mutations in known genes of interest. However, forward genetics approaches, in which mutations are produced randomly throughout the genome, has the advantage of producing alleles of varying severity both within known genes, in non-coding regulatory elements, or in other unannotated functional elements. Such forward genetic mutation screens in mice have typically involved treating male mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), followed by three generations of breeding to render potential recessive mutations homozygous, at which time phenotype screens can be performed. An alternative strategy for randomly mutagenizing the mouse genome is by chemical treatment of ES cells. This enables the use of multiple alternative chemicals with different mutational spectra, can reduce breeding to two generations, and impart a higher mutational load. Furthermore, ES cell mutagenesis can be used to create banks of clones that can be screened for point mutations in genes of interest, and to conduct forward genetic screens in vitro to detect potential phenotypes prior to generation of mice. In this chapter, we provide a detailed protocol for mutagenizing ES cells with the point mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>).",M2
19103426,"Genetic analysis and fine-mapping of a dwarfing with withered leaf-tip mutant in rice.A dwarf mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by mutagenesis of ethylene methylsulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) treatment from Nipponbare was identified. The mutant exhibited phenotypes of dwarfism and withered leaf tip (dwl1). Based on the internode length of dwl1, this mutant belongs to the dm type of dwarfing. Analysis of elongation of the second sheath and alpha-amylase activity in endosperm showed that the phenotype caused by dwl1 was insensitive to gibberellin acid treatment. Using a large F2 population derived from a cross between the dwl1 and an indica rice variety, TN1, the DWL1 gene was mapped to the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 3. Fine-mapping delimited it into a 46 kb physical distance between two STS markers, HL921 and HL944, where 6 open reading frames were predicted. Cloning of DWL1 will contribute to dissecting molecular mechanism that regulates plant height in rice, which will be beneficial to molecular assisted selection of this important trait.",M2
19098435,"Fly-TILL: reverse genetics using a living point mutation resource.Mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) has been the standard for traditional genetic screens, and in recent years has been applied to reverse genetics. However, reverse-genetic strategies require maintaining a viable germline library so that mutations that are discovered can subsequently be recovered. In applying our TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) method to establish a Drosophila reverse-genetic service (Fly-TILL), we chose to screen the Zuker lines, a large collection of EMS-mutagenized second- and third-chromosome balanced lines that had been established for forward-genetic screening. For the past four years, our Fly-TILL service has screened this collection to provide approximately 150 allelic series of point mutations for the fly community. Our analysis of &gt;2000 point mutations and indels have provided a glimpse into the population dynamics of this valuable genetic resource. We found evidence for selection and differential recovery of mutations, depending on distance from balancer breakpoints. Although this process led to variable mutational densities, we have nevertheless been able to deliver potentially valuable mutations in genes selected by Fly-TILL users. We anticipate that our findings will help guide the future implementation of point-mutation resources for the Drosophila community.",M2
18854043,"Applying genotyping (TILLING) and phenotyping analyses to elucidate gene function in a chemically induced sorghum mutant population.BACKGROUND: Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is ranked as the fifth most important grain crop and serves as a major food staple and fodder resource for much of the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The recent surge in sorghum research is driven by its tolerance to drought/heat stresses and its strong potential as a bioenergy feedstock. Completion of the sorghum genome sequence has opened new avenues for sorghum functional genomics. However, the availability of genetic resources, specifically mutant lines, is limited. Chemical mutagenesis of sorghum germplasm, followed by screening for mutants altered in important agronomic traits, represents a rapid and effective means of addressing this limitation. Induced mutations in novel genes of interest can be efficiently assessed using the technique known as Targeting Induced Local Lesion IN Genomes (TILLING). RESULTS: A sorghum mutant population consisting of 1,600 lines was generated from the inbred line BTx623 by treatment with the chemical agent ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>). Numerous phenotypes with altered morphological and agronomic traits were observed from M2 and M3 lines in the field. A subset of 768 mutant lines was analyzed by TILLING using four target genes. A total of five mutations were identified resulting in a calculated mutation density of 1/526 kb. Two of the mutations identified by TILLING and verified by sequencing were detected in the gene encoding caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) in two independent mutant lines. The two mutant lines segregated for the expected brown midrib (bmr) phenotype, a trait associated with altered lignin content and increased digestibility. CONCLUSION: TILLING as a reverse genetic approach has been successfully applied to sorghum. The diversity of the mutant phenotypes observed in the field, and the density of induced mutations calculated from TILLING indicate that this mutant population represents a useful resource for members of the sorghum research community. Moreover, TILLING has been demonstrated to be applicable for sorghum functional genomics by evaluating a small subset of the EMS-induced mutant lines.",M2
18811617,"A functional genomics resource for Brassica napus: development of an <e>EMS</e> mutagenized population and discovery of FAE1 point mutations by TILLING.Two ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutant populations of the semi-winter rapeseed cv. Ningyou7 were constructed with high mutant load, to provide a TILLING platform for functional genomics in Brassica napus, and for introduction of novel allelic variation in rapeseed breeding. Forward genetic screening of mutants from the M2 populations resulted in identification of a large number of novel phenotypes. Reverse genetic screening focused on the potentially multi-paralogous gene FAE1 (fatty acid elongase1), which controls seed erucic acid synthesis in rapeseed. A B. napus BAC library was screened, and loci in a reference mapping population (TNDH) were mapped to conclude that there are two paralogous copies of FAE1, one on each of the B. napus A and C genomes. A new procedure is demonstrated to identify novel mutations in situations where two or more very similar paralogous gene copies exist in a genome. The procedure involves TILLING of single plants, using existing SNPs as a positive control, and is able to distinguish novel mutations based on primer pairs designed to amplify both FAE1 paralogues simultaneously. The procedure was applied to 1344 M2 plants, with 19 mutations identified, of which three were functionally compromised with reduced seed erucic acid content.",M2
18780737,"Retention of induced mutations in a Drosophila reverse-genetic resource.Targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) is a reverse-genetic method for identifying point mutations in chemically mutagenized populations. For functional genomics, it is ideal to have a stable collection of heavily mutagenized lines that can be screened over an extended period of time. However, long-term storage is impractical for Drosophila, so mutant strains must be maintained by continual propagation of live cultures. Here we evaluate a strategy in which ethylmethane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) mutagenized chromosomes were maintained as heterozygotes with balancer chromosomes for &gt;100 generations before screening. The strategy yielded a spectrum of point mutations similar to those found in previous studies of EMS-induced mutations, as well as 2.4% indels (insertions and deletions). Our analysis of 1887 point mutations in 148 targets showed evidence for selection against deleterious lesions and differential retention of lesions among targets on the basis of their position relative to balancer breakpoints, leading to a broad distribution of mutational densities. Despite selection and differential retention, the success of a user-funded service based on screening a large collection several years after mutagenesis indicates sufficient stability for use as a long-term reverse-genetic resource. Our study has implications for the use of balancer chromosomes to maintain mutant lines and provides the first large-scale quantitative assessment of the limitations of using breeding populations for repositories of genetic variability.",M2
18641944,"<e>EMS</e> screens : from mutagenesis to screening and mapping.The success of Drosophila as a genetic model organism is based on the efficient generation, recovery, and identification of new mutations. Various agents have been used to induce de novo DNA lesions. However, the use of mutagenic alkylating agents, especially ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), has become a standard approach for mutagenesis that has been succesfully used in the classic forward genetic screens that have defined the field of developmental genetics, as well as in many alternative screening schemes that have since been developed. In this chapter, a basic EMS mutagenesis protocol is introduced, and examples for the fly crossing schemes used in several different types of screen are presented. In addition, some new genome sequence-based approaches are discussed that have alleviated the notoriously difficult molecular mapping of EMS induced point mutations. Together these protocols should allow researchers as yet unfamiliar with Drosophila genetics to take advantage of all the benefits of this mutagenesis method, which include its wide and largely unbiased coverage of the genome, the high mutation frequency, and the variety of null, hypomorphic, conditional (e.g., temperature sensitive), or domain specific mutations that can be caused by EMS treatment.",M2

The survival rate of cells decreased with increasing concentration of mutagens and herbicides. The mutants exhibited 23-59% increase in total carotenoid and astaxanthin contents. The NTG treated glufosinate resistant mutant showed increased (2.2% to 3.8% w/w) astaxanthin content.

After adding EMS to a shaken yeast suspension, the viability of yeast cells was assessed by diluted sample inoculation to solid yeast-extract peptone glucose (YEPG) medium at 15-min intervals. At 45 min, the viability of yeast cells was estimated to be about 40%. Mutagenized cells were recovered from YEPG broth after incubation at 30 degrees C for 18 h.

All plates were incubated at 30 degrees C for 2-6 d in order to form colonies. The mutant strains that tolerated high concentrations of ethanol were selected for bioethanol production in microfuge tubes containing fermentation medium. Formation of bioethanol in small tubes was detected by the distillation-colorimetric method. In addition, trehalose content and invertase activity were determined in each mutant strain.

18410684,"Phenotypic instability of Arabidopsis alleles affecting a disease Resistance gene cluster.BACKGROUND: Three mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana strain Columbia - cpr1, snc1, and bal - map to the RPP5 locus, which contains a cluster of disease Resistance genes. The similar phenotypes, gene expression patterns, and genetic interactions observed in these mutants are related to constitutive activation of pathogen defense signaling. However, these mutant alleles respond differently to various conditions. Exposure to mutagens, such as ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) and gamma-irradiation, induce high frequency phenotypic instability of the bal allele. In addition, a fraction of the bal and cpr1 alleles segregated from bal x cpr1 F1 hybrids also show signs of phenotypic instability. To gain more insight into the mechanism of phenotypic instability of the bal and cpr1 mutations, we systematically compared the behavior of these unusual alleles with that of the missense gain-of-function snc1 allele in response to DNA damage or passage through F1 hybrids. RESULTS: We found that the cpr1 allele is similar to the bal allele in its unstable behavior after EMS mutagenesis. For both the bal and cpr1 mutants, destabilization of phenotypes was observed in more than 10% of EMS-treated plants in the M1 generation. In addition, exceptions to simple Mendelian inheritance were identified in the M2 generation. Like cpr1 x bal F1 hybrids, cpr1 x snc1 F1 hybrids and bal x snc1 F1 hybrids exhibited dwarf morphology. While only dwarf F2 plants were produced from bal x snc1 F1 hybrids, about 10% wild-type F2 progeny were produced from cpr1 x snc1 F1 hybrids, as well as from cpr1 x bal hybrids. Segregation analysis suggested that the cpr1 allele in cpr1 x snc1 crosses was destabilized during the late F1 generation to early F2 generation. CONCLUSION: With exposure to EMS or different F1 hybrid contexts, phenotypic instability is induced for the bal and cpr1 alleles, but not for the snc1 allele. Our results suggest that the RPP5 locus can adopt different metastable genetic or epigenetic states, the stability of which is highly susceptible to mutagenesis and pairing of different alleles.",M2
18288719,"Persistence of DNA damage in the freshwater mussel Unio pictorum upon exposure to ethyl methanesulphonate and hydrogen peroxide.An important endpoint in assessing pollution-related toxicity is genotoxicity. To obtain insight into the time-course of oxidative- and alkylation-induced DNA damage in the freshwater mussel, Unio pictorum, mussels were exposed for 24 hr to concentration gradients of pro-oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and a mono-functional alkylating agent, ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>). DNA damage was assessed in haemocytes immediately upon exposure and over the recovery period of up to 72 days by means of comet and micronucleus assays. Following exposure to H(2)O(2), DNA damage as detected by the comet assay returned to control values after one day, except for the mussels exposed to the highest dose when damage was detectable for the next 3 days. In contrast, alkylation-induced DNA damage was detectable even after 72 days of recovery in de-chlorinated water, with a dose-response relationship observable throughout the whole recovery period. Micronucleus frequency was the highest on Day 3 after exposure to EMS; it decreased considerably by Day 7 and returned almost to the control levels 19 days after exposure, while no significant induction of micronuclei was observed in mussels exposed to H(2)O(2). Although the comet assay is considered a biomarker of recent genotoxic exposure, detecting DNA damage of shorter longevity than with the micronucleus assay, results presented here show that in the case of alkylation damage the comet assay reveals genotoxic exposure of U. pictorum in a dose-dependent manner even after 2 months.",M2
18218134,"TILLING to detect induced mutations in soybean.BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is an important nitrogen-fixing crop that provides much of the world's protein and oil. However, the available tools for investigation of soybean gene function are limited. Nevertheless, chemical mutagenesis can be applied to soybean followed by screening for mutations in a target of interest using a strategy known as Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING). We have applied TILLING to four mutagenized soybean populations, three of which were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) and one with N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU). RESULTS: We screened seven targets in each population and discovered a total of 116 induced mutations. The NMU-treated population and one EMS mutagenized population had similar mutation density (approximately 1/140 kb), while another EMS population had a mutation density of approximately 1/250 kb. The remaining population had a mutation density of approximately 1/550 kb. Because of soybean's polyploid history, PCR amplification of multiple targets could impede mutation discovery. Indeed, one set of primers tested in this study amplified more than a single target and produced low quality data. To address this problem, we removed an extraneous target by pretreating genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme. Digestion of the template eliminated amplification of the extraneous target and allowed the identification of four additional mutant alleles compared to untreated template. CONCLUSION: The development of four independent populations with considerable mutation density, together with an additional method for screening closely related targets, indicates that soybean is a suitable organism for high-throughput mutation discovery even with its extensively duplicated genome.",M2

Mutagenesis improved expression 3.7-fold to 144 mgl(-1) laccase in yeast, together with a 1.4-fold increase in K(cat). Thus, the total activity is enhanced 5-fold for 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiaoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS). In the presence of 0.6mM copper, the highest activity value reached 30 Uml(-1) after a 3-day cultivation at a temperature of 30 degrees C(.) In comparison with the wild type, the best mutant enzymatic properties (K(m) for ABTS and guaiacol, thermo- and pH stability, optimal pH) are not changed. Moreover, amino acid sequence analysis indicates that there are four substitutions in the best mutant laccase (Gly160Asp, Ala167Thr, Gly174Asp, and Glu234Gly). The best mutant laccase model showed that the Gly160 and Ala167 are to be found near the water channel; especially the distance of Ala167 to the Cu3a is 14.46 A. This implies that it is likely involved in the formation of water channel and that it helps facilitate the easy incoming and outgoing of water.",M2
17683471,"Ultrastructure of the seminiferous epithelium of ethyl methanesulphonate-treated mouse.Ethyl methanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) is a mutagenic alkylating agent that induces marked elevations of sperm abnormalities in mice. In this paper, we report the ultrastructural findings on the morphology of the seminiferous epithelium of mice resulting from EMS administration. Eight- to twelve-weeks-old male mice were injected intraperitoneally with EMS at 200 mg kg(-1) body weight daily for five consecutive days. Analysis of smears of epididymis and semi-thin sections of testes revealed that the more suitable specimens for the ultrastructural analysis were tissues of mice killed at the third week, following EMS administration. At this time, the spermatid was the damaged cell type. Abnormalities were mainly observed in the morphology of the nucleus, the acrosome, chromatin distribution and in the arrangement of the cytoplasmic microtubules, and binucleated spermatids were also observed. EMS has the capacity to penetrate the blood-testis barrier, and thus it can damage post-meiotic spermatogenic cells. However, morphological abnormalities could be the consequence of damage exerted on the differentiated spermatogonia stage, the most sensitive spermatogenic cell to the action of chemical agents or drugs. Our findings contribute to elucidate the action mechanism of the damage exerted by EMS administration on the germinal male cells.",M2
17584881,"Induction of V(D)J-mediated recombination of an extrachromosomal substrate following exposure to DNA-damaging agents.V(D)J recombinase normally mediates recombination signal sequence (RSS) directed rearrangements of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) germline gene segments that lead to the generation of diversified T cell receptor or immunoglobulin proteins in lymphoid cells. Of significant clinical importance is that V(D)J-recombinase-mediated rearrangements at immune RSS and nonimmune cryptic RSS (cRSS) have been implicated in the genomic alterations observed in lymphoid malignancies. There is growing evidence that exposure to DNA-damaging agents can increase the frequency of V(D)J-recombinase-mediated rearrangements in vivo in humans. In this study, we investigated the frequency of V(D)J-recombinase-mediated rearrangements of an extrachromosomal V(D)J plasmid substrate following exposure to alkylating agents and ionizing radiation. We observed significant dose- and time-dependent increases in V(D)J recombination frequency (V(D)J RF) following exposure to ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) but not a nonreactive analogue, methylsulfone (MeSulf). We also observed a dose-dependent increase in V(D)J RF when cells were exposed to gamma radiation. The induction of V(D)J rearrangements following exposure to DNA-damaging agents was not associated with an increase in the expression of RAG 1/2 mRNA compared to unexposed controls or an increase in expression of the DNA repair Ku70, Ku80 or Artemis proteins of the nonhomologous end joining pathway. These studies demonstrate that genotoxic alkylating agents and ionizing radiation can induce V(D)J rearrangements through a cellular response that appears to be independent of differential expression of proteins involved with V(D)J recombination.",M2

Andrographis paniculata (commonly referred to as 'kalmegh') has been used for centuries in traditional Indian and Chinese herbal medicine as a safe, natural folk remedy for assorted health concerns. In the present study, kalmegh (0.01 microg/7ml culture media) was used along with the highest dose of arsenic; the results showed that arsenic induced increase in these genotoxic endpoints were fairly diminished by kalmegh. In addition, mutagenic in vitro effect of ethyl methanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) was used as a positive control in this study. It is thus concluded from this study that Andrographis has a protective role in arsenic toxicity.",M2
17440105,"Mechanistic influences for mutation induction curves after exposure to DNA-reactive carcinogens.A mechanistic understanding of carcinogenic genotoxicity is necessary to determine consequences of chemical exposure on human populations and improve health risk assessments. Currently, linear dose-responses are assumed for DNA reactive compounds, ignoring cytoprotective processes that may limit permanent damage. To investigate the biological significance of low-dose exposures, human lymphoblastoid cells were treated with alkylating agents that have different mechanisms of action and DNA targets: methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), methylnitrosourea (MNU), ethylmethane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), and ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Chromosomal damage and point mutations were quantified with the micronucleus and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase forward mutation assays. MNU and ENU showed linear dose-responses, whereas MMS and EMS had nonlinear curves containing a range of nonmutagenic low doses. The lowest observed effect level for induction of chromosomal aberrations was 0.85 microg/mL MMS and 1.40 microg/mL EMS; point mutations required 1.25 microg/mL MMS and 1.40 microg/mL EMS before a mutagenic effect was detected. This nonlinearity could be due to homeostatic maintenance by DNA repair, which is efficient at low doses of compounds that primarily alkylate N(7)-G and rarely attack O atoms. A pragmatic threshold for carcinogenicity may therefore exist for such genotoxins.",M2
17428339,"Discovery of chemically induced mutations in rice by TILLING.BACKGROUND: Rice is both a food source for a majority of the world's population and an important model system. Available functional genomics resources include targeted insertion mutagenesis and transgenic tools. While these can be powerful, a non-transgenic, unbiased targeted mutagenesis method that can generate a range of allele types would add considerably to the analysis of the rice genome. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes), a general reverse genetic technique that combines traditional mutagenesis with high throughput methods for mutation discovery, is such a method. RESULTS: To apply TILLING to rice, we developed two mutagenized rice populations. One population was developed by treatment with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>), and the other with a combination of sodium azide plus methyl-nitrosourea (Az-MNU). To find induced mutations, target regions of 0.7-1.5 kilobases were PCR amplified using gene specific primers labeled with fluorescent dyes. Heteroduplexes were formed through denaturation and annealing of PCR products, mismatches digested with a crude preparation of CEL I nuclease and cleaved fragments visualized using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In 10 target genes screened, we identified 27 nucleotide changes in the EMS-treated population and 30 in the Az-MNU population. CONCLUSION: We estimate that the density of induced mutations is two- to threefold higher than previously reported rice populations (about 1/300 kb). By comparison to other plants used in public TILLING services, we conclude that the populations described here would be suitable for use in a large scale TILLING project.",M2
17417011,"Mutagenesis in Arabidopsis.Ethyl methane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) mutagenesis in Arabidopsis is the most widely used mutagenesis technique. EMS has high mutagenicity and low mortality and can be used in any laboratory with a fume hood. The chemical principle of EMS mutagenesis is simple; it is based on the ability of EMS to alkylate guanine bases, which results in base mispairing. An alkylated guanine will pair with a thymine base, resulting primarily in G/C to A/T transitions, which ultimately results in an amino acid change or deletion. There are several advantages to EMS mutagenesis compared with other mutagenesis techniques available for Arabidopsis. First, EMS generates a high density of nonbias irreversible mutations in the genome, which permits saturation mutagenesis without having to screen a large number of individual mutants. Second, EMS mutagenesis not only generates loss-of-function mutants, but can also generate novel mutant phenotypes, which include dominant or gain-of-function versions of proteins owing to alterations of specific amino acids. This chapter describes the use of EMS mutagenesis in Arabidopsis and how mutagenized plant populations should be handled after the mutagenesis event.",M2

The histological and genetic analyses described here implicate TRN2 in SAM function, where the peripheral zone in trn2 mutants is enlarged relative to the central stem cell zone. The trn2 mutant allele partially rescues the phenotype of shoot meristemless mutants but behaves additively to wuschel and clavata3 alleles during the vegetative phase and in the outer floral whorls. The development of carpels in trn2 wus-1 double mutant flowers indicates that pluripotent cells persist in floral meristems in the absence of TRN2 function and can be recruited for carpel anlagen. The data implicate a membrane-bound plant tetraspanin protein in cellular decisions in the peripheral zone of the SAM.",M2
17321738,"Characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant with enhanced production of beta-D-fructofuranosidase.The present study focused on the improvement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through random mutagenesis for enhanced production of beta-D-fructofuranosidase (FFase) using sucrose salt media. Sixty strains of S. cerevisiae were isolated from different fruits and soil samples and screened for FFase production. Enzyme productivity of different yeast isolates ranged from 0.03 to 1.10 U/ml. The isolate with the highest activity was subjected to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and mutagenesis using N-methyl N-nitro N-nitroso guanidine (MNNG). One mutant produced FFase at a level of 17.8+/-0.9 U/ml. The MNNG-treated isolate was exposed to ethyl methane sulphonate (<e>EMS</e>), and a mutant with an enzyme activity of 25.56+/-1.4 U/ml was obtained. Further exposure to UV radiation and chemicals yielded a mutant exhibiting an activity of 34.12+/-1.8 U/ml. After optimization of incubation time (48 h), sucrose concentration (5.0 g/L), initial pH (6.0) and inoculum size (2.0% v/v), enzyme production reached 45.65+/-4.6 U/ml with a noticeable greater than 40-fold increase compared to the wild-type culture. On the basis of kinetic variables, notably Q(p) (0.723+/-0.2U/g/h), Y(p/s) (2.036+/-0.05 U/g) and q(p) (0.091+/-0.02 U/g yeast cells/h), the mutant S. cerevisiae UME-2 was found to be a hyperproducer of FFase (LSD 0.054, p0.05).",M2

The perinatal period is one period in which these susceptibilities may be examined. Midwives at the Bradford Royal Infirmary collected venous blood samples from mothers at the time of birth and venous cord blood post-delivery. Lymphocytes were isolated from both blood types and examined in the alkaline comet assay using the monofunctional alkylating agent ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS). There were no biologically significant differences when subjects were categorized into subgroups based on lifestyle habits and physical characteristics, and overall there were no statistically significant differences in levels of DNA damage in mothers (n=22) and babies (n=22), except at the basal level (P&lt;0.05), but mean values in babies were always lower over the EMS dose range. Whole blood was used in the micronucleus (MN) assay, and there was a significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher rate of MN in mothers (n=17), per 1000 binucleates, as compared with lymphocytes from their offspring (n=17) at the basal level. This may be accounted for by age and endogenous factors. Overall, this current study cannot provide statistically significant evidence that children have either increased or decreased levels of susceptibility to a chemical toxin in comparison to adults when EMS is examined in vitro.",M2

The majority of the isolates exhibited a strong ability to solubilize hydroxyapatite in both solid and liquid media. The solubilization in liquid medium corresponded with a decrease in the pH of the medium. Serratia marcescens GPS-5, known for its biocontrol of late leaf spot in groundnut, emerged as the best solubilizer.

Seven mutants with increased (increased-MPS mutants) and 6 mutants with decreased (decreased-MPS mutants) MPS ability were isolated. All seven increased-MPS mutants were efficient at solubilizing phosphate in both solid and liquid NBRIP medium. Among the increased-MPS mutants, EMS XVIII Sm-35 showed the maximum (40%) increase in the amount of phosphate released in liquid medium compared with wild-type S. marcescens GPS-5, therefore, it would be a useful microbial inoculant in groundnut cultivation.

17177210,"Effect of vanillin on toxicant-induced lethality in the Drosophila melanogaster DNA repair test.Vanillin (VA) modulates the genotoxicity of chemical and physical agents in a complex manner. Previous studies indicate that VA inhibits the mutagenicity but increases the mitotic homologous recombination caused by at least some genotoxic agents. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of VA on the repair of lethal damage produced by three genotoxins, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), and mitomycin C (MMC), using the DNA repair test (DRT) in Drosophila melanogaster. VA, 0.25% and 0.5% (w/v), increased the toxicity of MMC and EMS in repair-deficient flies, as measured by a decrease in the proportion of male to female progeny in the DRT; sex ratios decreased from 18-48% for MMC and 21-97% for EMS. These effects may be caused by the inhibition of nonhomologous DNA end joining caused by VA. In contrast to the results with MMC and EMS, VA protected against the lethality of ENU in repair-defective flies, as measured by a 43-207% increase in the survival of male flies in the DRT. It was inferred that the protective effect was due to VA modulating stages prior to the induction of ENU lesions in DNA, including modulating the antioxidant properties of VA and/or to its interference with the metabolic activation and/or detoxification of specific genotoxins. The results from this study indicate that the characterization of VA as a promising agent for preventing damage to genes and chromosomes should be tempered by observations that VA can increase the toxicity of chemical agents.",M2
17164206,"Selection against males in Caenorhabditis elegans under two mutational treatments.Within populations with mixed mating systems, selfing is expected to be favoured over outcrossing unless a countervailing process such as severe inbreeding depression is present. In this study, we consider the relationship between the expression of deleterious alleles and the maintenance of outcrossing in the nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans. This species is characterized by an androdioecious breeding system composed of males at low frequency and self-fertilizing hermaphrodites that can only outcross via males. Here, we find that experimentally increasing the mutational load in four different isogenic wild isolates using 10 generations of Ethylmethane sulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) and UV irradiation mutagenesis significantly diminishes the cost of males. Males are maintained at higher frequencies in mutagenized versus non-mutagenized populations. Nevertheless, males still tend to be driven to low frequencies within isolates that are known to be prone to lose males. Further, we determine the viability effects of a single round of mutagen exposure and find that, for EMS, outcrossing overcomes the almost completely recessive and nearly lethal effects generated. We briefly interpret our results in light of current evolutionary theory of outcrossing rates.",M2

17049087,"TILLING is an effective reverse genetics technique for Caenorhabditis elegans.BACKGROUND: TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) is a reverse genetic technique based on the use of a mismatch-specific enzyme that identifies mutations in a target gene through heteroduplex analysis. We tested this technique in Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism in which genomics tools have been well developed, but limitations in reverse genetics have restricted the number of heritable mutations that have been identified. RESULTS: To determine whether TILLING represents an effective reverse genetic strategy for C. elegans we generated an <e>EMS</e>-mutagenised population of approximately 1500 individuals and screened for mutations in 10 genes. A total of 71 mutations were identified by TILLING, providing multiple mutant alleles for every gene tested. Some of the mutations identified are predicted to be silent, either because they are in non-coding DNA or because they affect the third bp of a codon which does not change the amino acid encoded by that codon. However, 59% of the mutations identified are missense alleles resulting in a change in one of the amino acids in the protein product of the gene, and 3% are putative null alleles which are predicted to eliminate gene function. We compared the types of mutation identified by TILLING with those previously reported from forward EMS screens and found that 96% of TILLING mutations were G/C-to-A/T transitions, a rate significantly higher than that found in forward genetic screens where transversions and deletions were also observed. The mutation rate we achieved was 1/293 kb, which is comparable to the mutation rate observed for TILLING in other organisms. CONCLUSION: We conclude that TILLING is an effective and cost-efficient reverse genetics tool in C. elegans. It complements other reverse genetic techniques in this organism, can provide an allelic series of mutations for any locus and does not appear to have any bias in terms of gene size or location. For eight of the 10 target genes screened, TILLING has provided the first genetically heritable mutations which can be used to study their functions in vivo.",M2
17045307,"Comparison of the mutagenic potential of 17 physical and chemical agents analyzed by the flow cytometry mutation assay.Several methods to assess genotoxicity of physical and chemical agents have been developed, most of which depend on growing colonies in selective medium. We recently published a new method for detecting mutations in the CD59 gene in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that contains a single copy of human chromosome 11 (CHO A(L)). The assay is based on detecting the surface expression of CD59 with monoclonal antibodies using flow cytometry. The capabilities of this flow cytometry mutation assay (FCMA) to detect mutations from a wide variety of genotoxic agents are described here. There was a 400-fold separation between CD59- and CD59+ populations based on fluorescence intensity. Small numbers of negative cells mixed in with positive cells were detected in a highly linear fashion. Mutation dose response curves over a dose range yielding 80% to 20% survival are shown for ethyl methane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), mitomycin C (MMC) and lead acetate. EMS and lead acetate exhibited a threshold in response while MMC had a linear dose response over the full dose range. The mutant fraction was measured over time periods ranging up to 35 days following treatment. The mutant fraction peaked at different times ranging from 6 to 12 days after treatment. An additional 14 chemical and physical agents including point mutagens, heavy metals, ionizing and UV radiation, and DNA intercalators and cross linkers, were analyzed for mutagenic potential after doses giving 80% to 20% survival. The results presented here demonstrate the sensitivity and broad-ranging capability of the FCMA to detect mutations induced by a variety of genotoxic agents.",M2
16960337,"A new system for detecting mutations in arabidopsis thaliana and the mutational spectra resulting from ethylmethanesulfonate treatment.A system was developed for the detection and analysis of mutations occurring on chromosomal DNA in plants. The plasmid pML4, carrying the Escherichia coli rpsL gene, a target gene for mutagenesis, was inserted into a shuttle vector, pCGN5138, to construct a plasmid which could be used for the transformation of plants. pML4 sequences were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana mediated by Agrobacterium. The pML4 DNA was rescued from transgenic Arabidopsis plants exposed to mutagens, and the plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli DH10B to isolate mutant clones. In this system, any form of inactivation mutation in the rpsL gene can be positively selected since it makes the E. coli cells resistant to streptomycin. Here we report that the system could detect the mutagenic effect of ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>). Further characterization of the mutants revealed that G:C to A:T transitions predominated among the EMS-induced mutations.

All the three doses of both VC and BC appeared to reduce the EMS-induced genotoxicity in this fish to a variable extent, of which the higher dose of VC appeared to give marginally better protection while the dose-response relationship was inconclusive for BC.

Significant (P &lt; 0.05) dose-dependent increases in DNA damage were observed following treatments conducted by exposing both isolated nuclei (acellular or in vitro exposure) and whole plants (in vivo exposure) to 0.01-5 mM EMS and 0.05-100 microM MMS for 2 hr at (26 +/- 2) degrees C. The assay was then used to evaluate the genotoxic potential of cadmium (Cd), a wetlands contaminant. In vitro exposure of nuclei from untreated leaves to 0.001-200 microM Cd for 2 hr resulted in significant (P &lt; 0.05) levels of DNA damage. Cd concentrations &gt;or=0.01 microM induced DNA damage as evidenced by increases in the Olive tail moment. In vivo exposure of plants to 0.01-500 microM Cd for 2, 4, and 18 hr resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in DNA damage in the nuclei isolated from roots and leaves. Cd-induced DNA damage was greater in roots than leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of a wetlands plant for genotoxicity assessment, using the Comet assay.",M2
16645639,"ARK, the Apaf-1 related killer in Drosophila, requires diverse domains for its apoptotic activity.In mammals and Drosophila, apoptotic caspases are under positive control of the CED-4-like proteins Apaf-1 and ARK, respectively. In an <e>EMS</e>-mutagenesis screen, we isolated 33 ark mutants as recessive suppressors of hid-induced apoptosis. The ark mutants are loss-of-function alleles characterized by reduced developmental apoptosis. Using the phenotypic series of these alleles, we identified helical domain I in the nucleotide oligomerization domain as critical for ARK's apoptotic activity. Interestingly, the WD40 region may also have an unanticipated positive requirement for the apoptotic activity of ARK. Considering structural information, we discuss the roles of these domains for assembly and activity of the ARK apoptosome, and propose that the WD40 region is anti-apoptotic in the absence of apoptotic signals, and pro-apoptotic in the presence of such signals. Furthermore, a defined null allele reveals that ark is required for most, but not all apoptosis suggesting the existence of an ARK-independent apoptotic pathway.",M2
16624596,"In vitro studies of DNA damage and its repair in cells from NHL patients with different p53 mutant protein status, resistant (p53(+)) and sensitive (p53(-)) to cancer chemotherapy.INTRODUCTION: Resistance to an anthracycline-based regimen, such as CHOP, constitutes a problem for curing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Chemoresistance in the clinic manifests itself as a lack of response to treatment or regrowth of a tumour after an initial response. METHODS: In this study, lymphocytes from NHL patients were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a free radical generating model agent, and ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), a model alkylating agent, to induce DNA damage which was evaluated by SCGE. This study assessed whether or not there were any differences in the patterns of damage and repair between cells from patients with p53 mutant protein abnormalities, i.e. over-expression (p53(+)) not responding to the CHOP regimen and patients responding to the CHOP regimen without p53 protein abnormalities (p53(-)) by comparison with control individuals (wild-type). An NHL cell line model [Raji TK(+) (mex(+)) and TK(-) (mex(-))] with p53 over-expression was also investigated. RESULTS: Results showed that frozen/thawed samples from healthy people were not suitable for use in repair studies, whilst fresh samples or samples incubated for 20 h at room temperature could be used. Tumour cells were more sensitive to damage than control cells. After treatment with H(2)O(2), cells from fresh or incubated blood showed a similar repair capacity. After treatment with EMS, there was a difference between repair in resistant and sensitive cells. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that the repair process is a useful cellular biomarker for investigating chemoresistance. The lack of repair in p53(+) cells may correlate with a low level of MGMT, since there was no repair in the Raji TK(-) cells lacking this enzyme.",M2

The compounds tested decreased the level of <e>EMS</e>-induced chromosome breakage and point mutations due to stimulation of maternal repair of DNA primary damage induced in spermatozoa as well as due to activation of DNA-repair in larvae and imago premeiotic stages of Drosophila males. Deficiency of DNA-repair systems leads to decrease in female and male germ-cell sensitivity to antimutagen action.",M2
16235724,"Isolation of 4-aminopyridine resistant mutants affecting alkali-insoluble glucan content of cell walls in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells when grown on synthetic medium plates containing 10 mM of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) undergo cell lysis. Using an ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis (<e>EMS</e>) screen, 4-AP resistant mutants (apr) were isolated which could grow on inhibitory concentration of 4-AP. Eighty mutants were obtained that were recessive, monogenic and formed two complementation groups. To identify genes, whose products might be interacting with the apr loci, extragenic suppressors were isolated, which reverted 4-AP resistance phenotype of apr mutants. The suppressors, when genetically characterized, were found to be recessive and represented two loci with overlapping functions. Representative alleles from apr mutants were analyzed for cell wall composition. They were found to have a higher amount of alkali-insoluble glucan signifying the role of alkali-insoluble glucan in cell wall maintenance.",M2
16043389,"Evaluation of the nuclear DNA Diffusion Assay to detect apoptosis and necrosis.We applied the nuclear DNA Diffusion Assay, described as an accurate tool to estimate apoptotic and necrotic cells [N.P. Singh, A simple method for accurate estimation of apoptotic cells, Exp. Cell Res. 256 (2000) 328-337] to tobacco root and leaf cells. In this assay, isolated nuclei are embedded in an agarose microgel on a microscope slide and low molecular-weight DNA fragments diffuse into the microgel. Exposure of the roots to hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the average nuclear area of isolated nuclei. After 4 and 24 h of recovery, all DNA damage was repaired. The data clearly demonstrate that the manifestation of diffused nuclei upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide is not the result of non-repairable apoptotic or necrotic DNA fragmentation, but represents repairable genotoxin-induced DNA damage. In contrast, treatment with the alkylating agent ethyl methanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) followed by 24 h of recovery produced a significant increase in the average nuclear area. The contribution of apoptosis to this increase cannot be excluded. Heat treatment of leaves at 50 degrees C for 1-15 min leading to necrosis, and treatment of isolated nuclei with DNase-I, which digests DNA to nucleosome-sized fragments as during apoptosis, also led to a dose-dependent increase in the nuclear area. The use of different fluorochromes (ethidium bromide, DAPI or YOYO-1) for DNA staining yielded similar results in the DNA Diffusion Assay. As all types and sizes of diffused nuclei were observed after EMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments, we were unable to differentiate, on the basis of the structure of the nuclei, between apoptotic or necrotic DNA fragmentation and other types of genotoxin-induced DNA damage in plants.",M2
15986928,"Identification of arabidopsis loci required for susceptibility to the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica.Plants are susceptible to a limited number of pathogens. Most infections fail due to active defense or absence of compatibility. Many components of the plant's surveillance system and defense arsenal have been identified in the last decades. However, knowledge is limited on compatibility; in particular, the role of plant factors in the infection process. To gain insight into these processes, we have initiated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant screen for reduced susceptibility to the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Ethyl methane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) mutants were generated in the highly susceptible Arabidopsis line Ler eds1-2. Eight downy mildew-resistant (dmr) mutants were analyzed in detail, corresponding to six different loci. Microscopic analysis showed that, in all mutants, H. parasitica growth was severely reduced. Resistance of dmr3, dmr4, and dmr5 was associated with constitutive expression of PR-1. Furthermore, dmr3 and dmr4, but not dmr5, also were resistant to Pseudomonas syringae and Golovinomyces orontii, respectively. However, enhanced activation of plant defense was not observed in dmr1, dmr2, and dmr6. We postulate that, in these susceptibility mutants, cellular processes are disrupted which are required for H. parasitica infection. This interesting new set of mutants provides a basis to elucidate the molecular processes underlying susceptibility to downy mildew in Arabidopsis.",M2
15963565,"Effect of tuftsin on embryo vaccination with Newcastle disease virus vaccine.The effect of tuftsin of embryo and post-hatch vaccination with NDV-F was studied. The embryo vaccination with NDV-F resulted in more number of dead-in-shell embryos. To overcome this problem, the vaccine was treated separately with ethyl methane sulfate (<e>EMS</e>) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and administered. Treating the vaccine with 5-FU resulted in better hatchability as compared to EMS treatment. In embryo, NDV antibody titres increased upto 2 weeks of age and declined thereafter, whereas in post-hatch vaccination, the antibody titre increased from second to fourth week of age and declined thereafter. The seroconversion was better when the vaccine was given along with tuftsin either to embryos or chicks (post-hatch vaccination) as compared to those vaccinated without tuftsin. Moreover, the percentage of hatchability was more in tuftsin administered groups. It was found that embryo vaccination can ensure definite protection during the early life of the chicks despite the presence of maternal antibodies. In cases where breeder vaccinations do not result in concomitant transfer of antibody to progeny chicks, embryo vaccination would give only neonatal resistance. During the later stages, embryo vaccination did not confer any advantage over post-hatch vaccination.",M2
15957190,"Effect of sulforaphane on micronucleus induction in cultured human lymphocytes by four different mutagens.Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are commonly found in cruciferous vegetables. A variety of biological activities have been ascribed to ITCs, such as inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes and induction of phase II enzymes in animal models. ITCs are also able to block cell-cycle progression and induce apoptosis in human cancer cells in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the ITC sulforaphane to protect cultured human lymphocytes from micronucleus (MN) induction by four different mutagens: ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), vincristrine (VIN), H(2)O(2) and mitomycin C (MMC). To understand the mechanisms of action of sulforaphane, the cultures were treated with the compound before, during and after treatment with the mutagens; in addition, the cultures were evaluated for the induction of apoptosis. Up to 10 microM, sulforaphane was non-genotoxic by itself, while 30 microM sulforaphane reduced the replicative index of the cells by more than 60%. Moreover, 1-10 microM sulforaphane reduced the MN frequency induced by EMS, VIN, H(2)O(2) and MMC in at least one of the treatment protocols; it had no effect on H(2)O(2)-MN induction in the post-treatment protocol, and it increased MN induction by MMC in the pre-treatment protocol. Apoptosis was produced in the cultures treated with sulforaphane alone. The fraction of apoptotic cells was increased after co- or post-treatment with sulforaphane and EMS and MMC, suggesting that sulforaphane-mediated apoptosis may remove highly damaged cells induced by these agents. Other mechanisms are involved in the anti-genotoxic activity of sulforaphane against VIN and H(2)O(2). Taken together, our findings indicate that under certain conditions sulforaphane possesses anti-genotoxic activity in vitro and that further studies are warranted to characterize this property in vivo.",M2
15899934,"Validation of Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model for genotoxicity assessment using modified alkaline Comet assay.The single cell gel electrophoresis or Comet assay is one of the most popular techniques for genotoxicity assessment. The present study was undertaken to validate our previously modified version of the Comet assay for genotoxicity assessment in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) with four well-known mutagenic and carcinogenic alkylating agents, i.e. ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and cyclophosphamide (CP). Third instar larvae (74 +/- 2 h) of D.melanogaster were fed different concentrations of EMS, MMS, ENU and CP (0.05, 0.5 and 1.0 mM) mixed standard Drosophila food for 24 h. At 98 +/- 2 h, the anterior midgut from control and treated larvae were dissected out, single-cell suspensions were prepared and Comet assay was performed. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage with all the four alkylating agents, in comparison to control. The lower concentration (0.05 mM) of the test chemicals, except MMS, did not induce any DNA damage in the gut cells of the exposed larvae. When comparison of Comet parameters was made among the chemicals, MMS was found to be the most potent genotoxicant and ENU the least. The present study validated our previous observation and shows that D.melanogaster is a sensitive and suitable model for the in vivo assessment of genotoxicity using our modified alkaline Comet assay.",M2
15826811,"Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and antimutagenicity of hexane extracts of Agaricus blazei determined in vitro by the comet assay and CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay.Agaricus blazei Murrill ss. Heinem, known as the sun mushroom or himematsutake, is a basidiomycete native to Brazil, which is popular for its medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to test hexane extracts (one fraction and its four sub-fractions) of A. blazei for bioactivity in cultured mammalian cells (CHO-K1). The comet assay, the colony forming assay (CFA) and CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay were used respectively to determine genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and antimutagenicity of these extracts at different concentrations. The cells were incubated in culture medium and treated for 3h according to the standard protocol for each assay. The DNA damage-inducing agent ethylmethane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) was utilized as the positive control and also in combination with extracts to test for a protective effect. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test. A relationship between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity could be established and two extracts EH6B and EH6D showed a protective tendency, while the others did not, with the primary extract EH6 causing the most substantial damage to genetic material. These findings warrant more in-depth studies of the active principles of this mushroom.",M2
15777853,"Induction of fusion-competent myoblast-specific gene expression during myogenic differentiation of Drosophila Schneider cells by DNA double-strand breaks or replication inhibition.Differentiation of Drosophila Schneider cells caused by DNA double-strand break (DSB)-inducing topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors were attenuated by ICRF-193, a non-DNA-damaging topo II inhibitor. ICRF-193 did not inhibit differentiation induced by neocarzinostatin (NCS), a drug that causes DNA DSBs independent of topo II. Schneider cells differentiated upon treatment with gamma-ray. These results suggest that DNA DSBs induce myogenic differentiation of Schneider cells. We also found DNA replication inhibitors, hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, and ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) induced myogenic differentiation of Schneider cells. HU-induced differentiation was inhibited upon pretreatment of cells with chemical inhibitors of PP 1/2A, p38 MAPK, JNK, and proteasome. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expressions of fusion-competent myoblast-specific genes lmd, sns, and del were induced in Schneider cells upon treatment with NCS or HU, whereas expressions of three founder cell-specific genes, duf, ants, and rols, were undetectable. These results indicate that the expression of fusion competent-myoblast-specific genes is induced during myogenic differentiation of Drosophila Schneider cells by DNA DSBs or replication inhibition.",M2
15725616,"Salicylic acid triggers genotoxic adaptation to methyl mercuric chloride and ethyl methane sulfonate, but not to maleic hydrazide in root meristem cells of Allium cepa L.Salicylic acid (SA), 0.01 mM, a signalling phytohormone, was tested for induction of adaptive response against genotoxicity of methyl mercuric chloride (MMCl), 0.013 mM; ethylmethane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), 2.5 mM, or maleic hydrazide (MH), 5 mM, in root meristem cells of Allium cepa. Induction of adaptive response to EMS by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 1 mM, and yet another secondary signal molecule was tested for comparison. Assessed by the incidence of mitoses with spindle and/or chromosome aberration and micronucleus, the findings provided evidence that SA-conditioning triggered adaptive response against the genotoxic-challenges of MMCl and EMS, but failed to do so against MH. H2O2, which is known to induce adaptive response to MMCl and MH, failed to induce the same against EMS in the present study. The findings pointed to the possible role of signal transduction in the SA-induced adaptive response to genotoxic stress that perhaps ruled out an involvement of H2O2.",M2
15712291,"Comparative study of the comet assay and the micronucleus test in amphibian larvae (Xenopus laevis) using benzo(a)pyrene, ethyl methanesulfonate, and methyl methanesulfonate: establishment of a positive control in the amphibian comet assay.The present investigation explored the potential use of the comet assay (CA) as a genotoxicity test in the amphibian Xenopus laevis and compared it with the French standard micronucleus test (MNT). Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) were used as model compounds for assessing DNA damage. Damage levels were measured as DNA strand breaks after alkaline electrophoresis of nuclei isolated from larval amphibian erythrocytes using the CA in order to establish a positive control for further ecotoxicological investigations. The results led to the selection of MMS as a positive control on the basis of the higher sensitivity of Xenopus laevis to this compound. The CA and MNT were compared for their ability to detect DNA damage with the doses of chemical agents and exposure times applied. EMS and MMS were shown to increase micronucleus and DNA strand break formation in larval erythrocytes concurrently. However, B[a]P increased micronucleus formation but not that of DNA strand breaks. Time-dose experiments over 12 days of exposure suggest that the CA provides an earlier significant response to genotoxicants than does the MNT. In Xenopus the CA appears to be a sensitive and suitable method for detecting genotoxicity like that caused by EMS and MMS. It can be considered a genotoxicity-screening tool. The results for B[a]P show that both tests should be used in a complementary manner on Xenopus.",M2
15599554,"Genomewide two-generation screens for recessive mutations by ES cell mutagenesis.Forward genetic mutation screens in mice are typically begun by mutagenizing the germline of male mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Genomewide recessive mutations transmitted by these males can be rendered homozygous after three generations of breeding, at which time phenotype screens can be performed. An alternative strategy for randomly mutagenizing the mouse genome is by chemical treatment of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of performing genome-wide mutation screens with only two generations of breeding. Mice potentially homozygous for mutations were obtained by crossing chimeras derived from ethylmethane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>)-mutagenized ES cells to their daughters, or by intercrossing offspring of chimeras. This strategy was possible because chimeras transmit variations of the same mutagenized diploid genome, whereas ENU-treated males transmit numerous unrelated genomes. This also results in a doubling of screenable mutations in a pedigree compared to germline ENU mutagenesis. Coupled with the flexibility to treat ES cells with a variety of potent mutagens and the ease of producing distributable, quality-controlled, long-term supplies of cells in a single experiment, this strategy offers a number of advantages for conducting forward genetic screens in mice.",M2
15599060,"Isolation of mutants with aberrant mitochondrial morphology from Arabidopsis thaliana.To identify genes related to plant mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, novel mutants with respect to mitochondrial morphology were isolated from an ethyl methane sulphonate (<e>EMS</e>)-mutated population of Arabidopsis thaliana. Mitochondria were visualized by transforming Arabidopsis with a gene for a fusion protein consisting of GFP and a mitochondria-targeting pre-sequence. From 19,000 M2 populations, 17 mutants were isolated by fluorescent microscopic observations. All mitochondria in these mutants were longer and/or larger than wild-type mitochondria. The approximate chromosomal loci of the mutations of seven mutants that grew well were determined. The mitochondrial phenotypes of six of the mutants were recessive but the mitochondrial phenotype of the seventh mutant was dominant. Chromosomal rough mapping of the seven mutants showed that the mutations occurred at four different loci. At least one of these loci was novel, i.e., it was different from loci of other known mitochondrial morphology mutants of Arabidopsis and different from loci of Arabidopsis homologues of yeast genes related to mitochondrial morphology.",M2
15576360,"Chemotherapeutic deletion of CTG repeats in lymphoblast cells from DM1 patients.Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of a (CTG).(CAG) repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. At least 17 neurological diseases have similar genetic mutations, the expansion of DNA repeats. In most of these disorders, the disease severity is related to the length of the repeat expansion, and in DM1 the expanded repeat undergoes further elongation in somatic and germline tissues. At present, in this class of diseases, no therapeutic approach exists to prevent or slow the repeat expansion and thereby reduce disease severity or delay disease onset. We present initial results testing the hypothesis that repeat deletion may be mediated by various chemotherapeutic agents. Three lymphoblast cell lines derived from two DM1 patients treated with either ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), mitomycin C, mitoxantrone or doxorubicin, at therapeutic concentrations, accumulated deletions following treatment. Treatment with EMS frequently prevented the repeat expansion observed during growth in culture. A significant reduction of CTG repeat length by 100-350 (CTG).(CAG) repeats often occurred in the cell population following treatment with these drugs. Potential mechanisms of drug-induced deletion are presented.",M2
15515154,"Effect of vanillin on toxicant-induced mutation and mitotic recombination in proliferating somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster.Vanillin (VA; C8H8O3) is a flavoring agent that in previous studies has both increased and decreased the genotoxicity of chemical agents, depending on the nature of both the agent and the genetic event measured. The ability of VA to modulate the mutagenicity and recombinogenicity of three different monoalkylating agents, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), and ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), and the intercalating agent bleomycin (BLEO) was examined using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. While neither the mutagenicity nor the recombinagenicity of ENU or MNU was modified by posttreatment with VA, EMS-induced genetic toxicity was enhanced by as much as 30%. This overall enhancement included a synergistic increase in mitotic recombination and a lesser decrease in mutation. Posttreatment with VA also produced an increase in the genotoxicity of BLEO, which was characterized by increases of 120% and 180% for 0.5% and 1% VA, respectively. This enhancement was restricted to an increase in recombinational events, since no alteration in BLEO-induced mutation was observed. The data suggest that the major VA-modulatory action on genotoxicity in D. melanogaster is related to its synergistic effects on somatic recombination, which has a greater consequence on overall genotoxicity than its antimutagenic effects. Since the SMART assay is specifically sensitive to mitotic crossing-over, our data suggest that VA promotes toxicant-induced homologous recombination, at least in the proliferative cells of Drosophila.",M2
15499397,"Map positions of third chromosomal female sterile and lethal mutations of Drosophila melanogaster.Chromosomal mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) treatment can cause female sterility or maternal-effect lethality in Drosophila. EMS is particularly useful to researchers because it creates mutations independent of position effects. However, because researchers have little control over the chromosomal site of mutation, post-mutagenic genetic mapping is required to determine the cytological location of the mutation. To make a valuable set of mutants more useful to the research community, we have mapped the uncharacterized part of the female-sterile - maternal-effect lethal Tubingen collection. We mapped 49 female-sterile - maternal-effect lethal alleles and 72 lethal alleles to individual deficiency intervals on the third chromosome. In addition, we analyzed the phenotype of ovaries resulting from female sterile mutations. The observed phenotypes range from tumorous ovaries and early blocks in oogenesis, to later blocks, slow growth, blocks in stage 10, to apparently full development of the ovary. The mapping and phenotypic characterization of these 121 mutations provide the necessary information for the researcher to consider a specific mutant as a candidate for their gene of interest.",M2

RESULTS: The two cell lines brought about similar results in the study. The tolerance of TK6 to all four chemicals was lower than that of L5178Y, and all the relative mutation indices of TK6 were higher than those of L5178Y.

15381973,"Production of ribonucleotides by autolysis of Pichia anomala mutant and some physiological activities.Various mutants of Pichia anomala were isolated by ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) treatment and UV irradiation through cycloheximide resistance and KCl sensitivity. The selected mutant HA-2 accumulated a higher content of RNA and grew faster than the wild-type strain in yeast extract-malt (YM) broth. Autolysis of the HA-2 mutant at 60 degrees C and pH 7.0 for 6 h was the best condition to obtain maximum yields of 5'-ribonucleotides, inosinic monophosphate (IMP) (6.2 mg/g biomass) and guanylic monophosphate (GMP) (35.5 mg/g biomass). The yield of adenylic monophosphate (AMP) (7.8 mg/g biomass) was optimal at 60 degrees C at pH 6.5 for 6 h. The inhibitory activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the nitrite-scavenging activity for autolysates of the HA-2 mutant were about 13.0% and 47.0% higher than those of native strain, respectively.",M2
15259051,"Inhibitors arrest myofibrillogenesis in skeletal muscle cells at early stages of assembly.A three-step model for myofibrillogenesis has been proposed for the formation of myofibrils [Rhee et al., 1994: Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton 28:1-24; Sanger et al., 2002: Adv. Exp. Med. 481:89-105]: premyofibril to nascent myofibril to mature myofibril. We have found two chemically related inhibitors that will arrest development at both the first and second step. Cultured quail embryonic skeletal myoblasts were treated with ethyl methane sulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) or 2-aminoethyl-methanesulfonate (MTSEA+). When the myoblasts fused in the presence of either of these compounds, myosheets rather than myotubes formed. Treated cells were fixed and immunostained against multiple proteins commonly found in muscle cells. Protein expression and localization throughout the myosheet were similar to that of developing myotube tips. Cells treated with high concentrations of EMS (10 mM) stained for non-muscle myosin II, sarcomeric alpha-actinin, and tropomyosin. No zeugmatin (Z-band region of titin) or muscle myosin II antibody staining was detected in fibers in this treatment group. These fibers are comparable to premyofibrils in control myotubes. At lower concentrations of EMS (7.5 to 5 mM), fibers that formed stained for muscle myosin II and titin as well as for non-muscle myosin IIB, sarcomeric alpha-actinin, and tropomyosin. Muscle myosin II was in an unbanded pattern. These fibers are comparable to nascent myofibrils observed during normal myofibrillogenesis. Similar effects to those obtained by treating cells with EMS were obtained when we treated cultured cells with MTSEA+ (5 mM) and stained them with sarcomeric alpha-actinin. MTSEA+ is chemically related to EMS, and is a well-known inhibitor of ryanodine receptors in skeletal muscle cells. Some abnormalities such as nemaline-like rods and other protein aggregates also appear within the myosheet during EMS and MTSEA+ treatment. Removal of these two inhibitors of myofibrillogenesis allows the premyofibrils and nascent myofibrils to form mature myofibrils.",M2

The lethal and mutagenic effects of ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) and UV light on four Frankia strains were investigated. UV irradiation or EMS treatment of strain EuI1c cells resulted in the formation of two different colony types: rough and smooth. The smooth colonies were conditional sporulation mutants. In the case of EMS-induced cells of strain Cc1.17, resistance to lincomycin, ampicillin, and 5-fluorouracil occurred at a frequency of 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-5), and 4 x 10(-5), respectively. The lincomycin-resistant mutants produced a yellow-tan pigment that was released into the growth medium. Resistance to tetracycline and lincomycin with EMS-induced cells of strain EuI1c occurred at a frequency of 3.2 x 10(-3) and 4.7 x 10(-4), respectively. These strains will be useful for the development of genetic methods for Frankia.",M2
15178102,"Assessing DNA damage in cnidarians using the Comet assay.The assessment of DNA damage by the Comet assay has been described as a useful non-specific general biomarker of stress in many marine organisms. In field situations it has successfully been employed to distinguish between reference and polluted sites and in the laboratory it has been widely used as a mechanistic tool to determine pollutant effects and mechanisms of DNA damage. To date a wide range of marine vertebrates and invertebrates have been used, however, the usefulness of this assay as a biomarker in cnidarians has not yet been assessed. The aims of this study were to optimize the Comet assay for cnidarian cells and to assess its utility for detecting genotoxic damage in these cells. Cells were isolated from the North American pacific coast temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima using a non-enzymatic dissociation procedure and viability was determined to be in excess of 90%. Cells were incubated either with (1 h acute exposures) hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), ethylmethanesulphonate (<e>EMS</e>) or benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P). In comparison to other marine species, anemone cells exhibited high control or background levels of DNA strand breaks. Despite this, however, we observed dose responses for each of the study chemicals with no reduction in cell viability. This study demonstrates that anemone cells respond to known DNA damaging agents, including B[a]P which requires metabolism to exert its genotoxic effect, and that the Comet assay may prove to be a useful biomarker of stress in cnidarian species.",M2
15166169,"Genetic variation at the tomato Cf-4/Cf-9 locus induced by <e>EMS</e> mutagenesis and intralocus recombination.The interaction between tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and the leaf mold pathogen Cladosporium fulvum is an excellent model for investigating disease resistance gene evolution. The interaction is controlled in a gene-for-gene manner by Cf genes that encode type I transmembrane extracellular leucine-rich repeat glycoproteins that recognize their cognate fungal avirulence (Avr) proteins. Cf-4 from L. hirsutum and Cf-9 from L. pimpinellifolium are located at the same locus on the short arm of tomato chromosome 1 in an array of five paralogs. Molecular analysis has shown that one mechanism for generating sequence variation in Cf genes is intragenic sequence exchange through unequal crossing over or gene conversion. To investigate this we used a facile genetic selection to identify novel haplotypes in the progeny of Cf-4/Cf-9 trans-heterozygotes that lacked Cf-4 and Cf-9. This selection is based on the ability of Avr4 and Avr9 to induce Cf-4- or Cf-9-dependent seedling death. The crossovers were localized to the same intergenic region defining a recombination hotspot in this cross. As part of a structure-function analysis of Cf-9 and Cf-4, nine EMS-induced mutant alleles have been characterized. Most mutations result in single-amino-acid substitutions in their C terminus at residues that are conserved in other Cf proteins.",M2
15361148,"A structured mutant population for forward and reverse genetics in Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).Two large-scale ethylmethanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>) mutant populations from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Optic have been developed to promote both forward and reverse genetics in this crop. Leaf material and seed from approximately 20 000 M(2) plants were individually harvested, freeze-dried and archived. DNA was isolated from 9216 plants from the 20 and 30 mm EMS treatments and assembled into 1152 eight-plant pools. To facilitate PCR-based mutation scanning an approach has been employed that combines cleavage of heteroduplexes using the Cel nuclease (Cel I), post-cleavage intercalating dye labeling and the subsequent detection of cleaved products on a Transgenomic WAVE-HS. The populations were evaluated by screening for induced mutations in two genes of interest and the induced mutations were validated by sequence analysis. To enhance the screening process, 12-16 M(3) progeny from each of the M(2) plants were assessed for visible phenotypes and the data entered into a web accessible database (http://bioinf.scri.sari.ac.uk/distilling/distilling.html).",M2
15324747,"Screening for genotoxicity using the DRAG assay: investigation of halogenated environmental contaminants.The DRAG test is a rapid high-throughput screening assay for detection of repairable adducts by growth inhibition of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) characterized by different defects in DNA repair. A more pronounced growth inhibition caused by a certain DNA-reactive substance in a repair-deficient cell line (EM9, UV4 and UV5) as compared to wild-type cells (AA8) is interpreted as a consequence of their inability to repair induced DNA lesions. Thus, the use of such cell lines in the DRAG test may provide information of the type of DNA lesions induced by a certain genotoxic substance. To select optimal assay conditions, as well as to provide a mechanistic basis for interpreting the results, the model compounds benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), ethyl methanesulfonate (<e>EMS</e>), mitomycin C (MMC) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were used. These agents can induce bulky adducts, alkyl adducts, cross-links and oxidative damage, respectively. The specificity of the DRAG test constitutes an important prerequisite for its practical use in a broader context. To assess this aspect, we have investigated the genotoxic and cytotoxic properties of a selection of metabolites of and isomers from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), along with a few other halogenated compounds. All these compounds have been detected as pollutants in the external environment, and for most of them there is no convincing evidence of mutagenicity from conventional assays. As could be predicted from their mode of action, BPDE, MMC, and EMS were all found to be more toxic in the repair-deficient cell lines compared with wild-type cells. The results with H2O2 were inconclusive, and the PCB metabolite 4,4'-diOH-CB80 only exhibited borderline activity, while all other halogenated compounds, or their metabolites, were found to be inactive. In conclusion, the DRAG assay could provide a robust and useful tool when screening large numbers of potentially genotoxic agents, while in addition providing mechanistic information. However, the usefulness of the selected cell lines to detect oxidative damage may be limited.",M2
