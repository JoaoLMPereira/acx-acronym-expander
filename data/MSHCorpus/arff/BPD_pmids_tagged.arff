20456770,"[From classic to new bronchopulmonary dysplasia]Chronic lung damage (bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>)) is one of the most serious complications affecting preterm neonates. During the last decade the aetiology of BPD has changed. Whereas 'classic BPD' was characterised mainly by lung damage and fibrosis caused by oxygen toxicity and mechanical ventilation, 'new BPD' is characterised by a disorder in lung development. This aetiological shift has been brought about by improved survival in extremely premature infants as a result of, for instance, antenatal corticosteroid administration and postnatal surfactant therapy. New BPD requires a new therapeutic approach. Therapeutic options for developing BPD include caffeine, vitamin A and postnatal corticosteroids. Once BPD has occurred, diuretics and inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids may be useful. However, the available therapies decrease the risk of developing BPD by just a small percent. In the future, artificial surfactants and non-invasive ventilation may prove to be useful in the prevention of BPD.",M1

Preliminary report]OBJECTIVE: To assess airway resistance values and urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) concentrations before and after salbutamol inhalation in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children with BPD were cross-sectionally studied to measure airway resistance by the interrupter technique (Rint), before and after inhaling 200 ig salbutamol, and to quantify urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) by immunoassay. RESULTS: Thirty one children with BPD (15 females) aged between 3 months and 9 years were studied. Our results showed that LTE4 did not correlate with Rint values (r = 0.12, p = 0.52) even after adjusting by gender, atopy history, steroid use, and gastroesophageal reflux. Likewise, LTE4 did not correlate with the degree of the airway response to salbutamol (r = -0.13, p = 0.50). A strong inverse association between age and Rint (r = -0.58, p &lt; 0.001) was observed. CONCLUSION: We concluded that urinary LTE, did not correlate with airway resistance or with the response to a bronchodilator drug in children with BPD, suggesting that leukotrienes are not involved in airway obstruction in this disease.",M1
20363459,"Quality improvement in respiratory care: decreasing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Chronic lung disease (CLD) is one of the most common long-term complications in very preterm infants. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is the most common cause of CLD in infancy. Modern neonatal respiratory care has witnessed the emergence of a new BPD that exhibits decreased fibrosis and emphysema, but also decreased alveolar septation, and microvascular development. CLD encompasses the classic and the new BPD, and recognizes that lung injury can occur in term infants who need aggressive ventilatory support and who develop lung injury as a result, and that CLD is a multisystem disease. Controversy exists on whether quality improvement (QI) methods that implement multiple interventions will be effective in limiting pathology with multiple causes. Caution in generalization of QI findings is encouraged. QI methods toward improvement in CLD or any other outcome should be considered as a tool for implementing evidence and studying the effects of change in complex adaptive systems.",M1
20350435,"[Expression of high mobility group protein-B1 in mice with hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of hyperoxia exposure on high mobility group protein-B1 (HMGB1) expression in neonatal mice and the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly exposed to 60% O2 or air 1 day after birth. BPD was induced by 60% O2 exposure. The pulmonary tissue samples were harvested 3, 7 and 14 days after exposure. The pathologic changes of pulmonary tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson staining and radical alveolar count. The expression of HMGB1 protein in lungs was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of HMGB1 mRNA was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. RESULTS: In the BPD group, the lungs developed decreased alceolar septation, swollen alveolar epithelium, stroma edema, interstitial fibrosis and developmental lag when compared with the control group. These changes became more obvious with more prolonged hyperoxia exposure. The expression of HMGB1 protein and mRNA 7 and 14 days after exposure increased significantly in the BPD group compared with that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxia exposure results in an increase in lung HMGB1 expression. The increased HMGB1 expression may be associated with the development of BPD.",M1
20204740,"Impaired vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in the pathogenesis of neonatal pulmonary vascular disease.Abstract Of diverse growth factors that contribute to normal lung development, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an especially prominent role in the normal growth and development of the pulmonary circulation in the fetus and newborn. Strong experimental and clinical data support the role of impaired VEGF signaling in the pathogenesis of two major clinical disorders of the developing lung circulation: persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). These disorders are each characterized by impaired vascular growth, structure and reactivity, which are at least partly due to endothelial cell dysfunction. This chapter will briefly discuss VEGF signaling during normal lung development and how disruption of VEGF signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of neonatal pulmonary vascular disease in these settings.",M1
20184127,"[Predictor factors for the production of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the preterm newborn]INTRODUCTION: The bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is a lung illness chronicle that is developed in preterm newborn (PTNB) mainly, secondary to multiple factors of risk which have not been studied completely. OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictors factors (of risk factors) for the production of BPD in the PTNB of 28 at 36 weeks of gestational age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty medical records from January 2004 to May 2006 of PTNB that there was received mechanical attendance to the ventilation (MAV) at least 24 hrs were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided in two groups: group A, PTNB that had BPD, composed of 40 patients (cases) and group B, PTNB with MAV but that had not developed BPD due to the procedure of 40 patients too (controls). It was used descriptive and inferential statistic. Odds ratio (OR) and multivariate analysis were used to study predictors factors. Statistical significance was considered with P &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: There was significant difference of the supply of the intravenous (i.v.) fluids the days 2, 3, 4 and 7 of extrauterine life (EUL), of the oxygen inspired fraction (FiO2) of in the day 7 of being had initiate the MAV, of the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) in the day 1 and 3 of being had initiate the MAV everything to favor of the cases, with P &lt; 0.05. In the multivariate analysis was significative in the intake of i.v. fluids &gt; or = 140 mL x kg of weight x day to the fourth day of EUL, the oxygen arterial pressure (PaO2) &gt; 70 mm Hg for &gt; 4 days, reintubations number (two or more times) and the symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), all with P &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that, in critically sick PTNB, they exist one series of well-known risk factors but more specified in this study that they should avoid as much as possible; the handling of the liquids i.v. should be cautious, not to spend of 139 mL x kg x day to the 4th day of EUL, not to be so permissive with the PaO2 maintaining it in values &lt; or = 70 mm of Hg after four days, to avoid as much as possible the reintubations and to treat the but quick the symptomatic PDA still without that it is significant, to diminish this way, the risk of BPD.",M1
20175046,"[Significance of nitric oxide inhalation (NO) in preterm infants&lt; 34 weeks of gestation]In 2001, NO was approved as a therapeutic agent in Europe for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension in late preterm infants &gt;34 weeks of gestational age and term newborns. Recent observational studies suggest, that preterm infants &lt;34 weeks of gestation with acute hypoxic lung failure could benefit from inhaled NO (iNO) by improved oxygenation. To date, 21 randomised-controlled trials have enrolled 3 336 preterm infants &lt;34 weeks of gestation for iNO treatment. Overall, iNO treatment does not reduce the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) or death compared to controls. In addition, iNO treatment of preterm infants with hypoxic respiratory failure or increased risk of BPD does not affect the combined incidence of death and BPD. However, early prophylactic use of iNO in preterm infants with respiratory distress seems to improve survival without BPD or severe cerebral damage. Current data of long term neurological outcome of iNO-treated preterm infants do not seem to justify iNO administration. Outside of well designed clinical trials iNO-treatment of preterm infants can currently not be recommended.",M1
20138299,"Two-year neurodevelopmental outcomes of ventilated preterm infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide.OBJECTIVE: In a randomized multi-center trial, we demonstrated that inhaled nitric oxide begun between 7 and 21 days and given for 24 days significantly increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) in ventilated premature infants weighing &lt;1250 g. Because some preventative BPD treatments are associated with neurodevelopmental impairment, we designed a follow-up study to assess the safety of nitric oxide. STUDY DESIGN: Our hypothesis was that inhaled nitric oxide would not increase neurodevelopmental impairment compared with placebo. We prospectively evaluated neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes at 24 months postmenstrual age in 477 of 535 surviving infants (89%) enrolled in the trial. RESULTS: In the treated group, 109 of 243 children (45%) had neurodevelopmental impairment (moderate or severe cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, bilateral hearing loss, or score &lt;70 on the Bayley Scales II), compared with 114 of 234 (49%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75-1.12; P = .39). No differences on any subcomponent of neurodevelopmental impairment or growth variables were found between inhaled nitric oxide or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nitric oxide improved survival free of BPD, with no adverse neurodevelopmental effects at 2 years of age.",M1
20121490,"The use of culture-independent tools to characterize bacteria in endo-tracheal aspirates from pre-term infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). Despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may be a risk factor in BPD development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. This study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone sequence analyses to characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (ET) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. A wide range of different bacteria was identified in the samples. Forty-seven T-RF band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. Clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by T-RFLP. We speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including S. aureus, Enterobacter sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of BPD. Further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as T-RFLP, hold important potential for the characterization of neonatal conditions, such as BPD.",M1
20113663,"[Effects of prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors in neonatal rat lungs]OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of prolonged 75% oxygen exposure on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) in the neonatal rat lungs and to elucidate the effects of prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen on lung vascular development and its relationship with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS: Forty eight Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly exposed to air (control group) and 75% oxygen (experimental group) 12 hrs after birth. The rats were sacrificed 7, 14 and 21 days after exposure and their lungs were sampled. The lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation. Expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein and mRNA was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: After being exposed to 75% oxygen for 21 days, lung tissues had pathological changes as 'new' BPD. Expressions of VEGF protein (10.9 + or - 2.7 vs 30.8 + or - 6.4), VEGFR1 protein (5.4 + or - 1.4 vs 15.6 + or - 3.4) and VEGFR2 protein (11.3 + or - 2.6 vs 21.7 + or - 4.5) on day 21 in the experimental group decreased significantly as compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). The expression of VEGF mRNA (1.6 vs 3.3), VEGFR1 mRNA (0.4 vs 6.6) and VEGFR2 mRNA (0.5 vs 4.9) on day 21 in the experimental group also decreased significantly as compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen may cause BPD possibly by inhibiting lung vascular development in neonatal rats.",M1
20091533,"WITHDRAWN. Inhaled steroids for neonatal chronic lung disease.BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is a chronic disorder associated with prematurity. Systemic steroids induce at least a temporary improvement in respiratory function, but are associated with adverse side effects. Inhaled steroids have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine if inhaled corticosteroids are effective in alleviating the morbidity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) compared to placebo. SEARCH STRATEGY: We identified randomised, controlled trials (RCT) within the Cochrane Database, references from retrieved trials, hand searches of journals and contact with pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials involving infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity and treated with inhaled steroids versus placebo were included. Patients receiving systemic corticosteroids were excluded. Co-interventions included antenatal systemic steroids, routine neonatal intensive care, ventilatory support, surfactant replacement therapy, diuretics and bronchodilators. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four of the seven included trials were of good methodological quality. There were five parallel-group trials in ventilated infants. These were comparable in terms of population, co-interventions and need for increased inspired oxygen concentration. They differed in terms of type, dose and duration (7-28 days) of inhaled steroids. Two cross-over trials were performed in non-ventilated patients. An update search was conducted in June 2002, which identified an additional excluded study. MAIN RESULTS: The inability to extubate during treatment was markedly reduced in infants treated with inhaled steroids; Peto Odds Ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.43. There was heterogeneity in this finding, however, with one study that contributed 30% of the total number of patients reporting no successful extubations in either treatment arm over one week. The risk of sepsis appeared similar between the two groups (N=3, OR=0.72, 95%CI: 0.21 to 2.43). The small number of trials precluded analysis to examine the effect of differences in drug, duration of therapy, delivery system, co-interventions, and disease severity. Reduced oxygen requirements were reported in one of the two trials performed in non-ventilated infants, but inadequate data reporting precluded pooling of data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In ventilated infants with BPD, inhaled steroids administered for 1 to 4 weeks improved the rate of extubation with no apparent increase in the risk of sepsis. No firm conclusion could be derived with regard to the efficacy of inhaled steroids in non-ventilated infants.",M1
20087186,"Genetics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the age of genomics.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: According to recent evidence, susceptibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) in preterm infants is predominantly inherited. The purpose of this review is to discuss current published genetic association studies in light of the accumulated knowledge in genomics. RECENT FINDINGS: Major advances in the development of next-generation genotyping and sequencing platforms, statistical methodologies, inventories of functional outcome of some common genetic polymorphisms and large-scale cataloguing of genetic variability among many of the world's ethnic populations have greatly facilitated the study of polygenic conditions. For BPD, genetic-association studies have primarily focused on components of innate (e.g. first-line) immune and antioxidant defences, mechanisms of vascular and lung remodelling, and surfactant proteins. However, studies have been limited in sample size and therefore fraught with a high probability of false-positive and false-negative associations. Nonetheless, candidate gene associations have indicated some novel biological pathways and provide a conceptual framework for the design of larger, collaborative population-based studies. SUMMARY: Although studies to date have not been able to identify reproducible genetic risk markers for BPD, they have directed us towards new, promising research avenues.",M1
20054861,"Severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and increased risk of feeding desaturation and growth delay in very low birth weight preterm infants.Oral feeding has been reported to compromise breathing among preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) during hospitalization or shortly after discharge. However, limited information was available concerning whether preterm infants with BPD remain vulnerable to feeding and growth insufficiency after a longer term of follow-up. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the effect of severity of BPD on pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) during feeding and growth in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants during infancy. Seventy-two preterm infants with VLBW and 15 term infants were prospectively examined their growth and SpO(2) during feeding at 2, 4, and 6 months of corrected age. The severity of BPD was graded in VLBW infants according to the American National Institutes of Health consensus definition. In comparison to VLBW infants with mild BPD and term infants, VLBW infants with severe BPD showed significantly lower mean levels of SpO(2) during feeding at 2-6 months corrected age (P &lt; 0.05). Those with severe BPD further exhibited higher rates of growth delay (weight &lt; 10th percentile) throughout the study period. Among VLBW infants, severe BPD had an adverse relation with subsequent weight measures after adjustment for medical and demographic confounding variables (beta = -904 g, P = 0.03). The consensus BPD definition is useful to identify those preterm infants who are at greater risk of feeding desaturation and growth delay during infancy and close monitoring of SpO(2) during feeding should be advised.",M1
20035248,"Molecular microbiological characterization of preterm neonates at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.The role of infection in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is unknown. We present an observational study of 55 premature infants born weighing less than 1.3 kg within two level III neonatal intensive care units. Endotracheal aspirates (ETA) and nasogastric aspirates (NGA) were studied with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling to elucidate the total bacterial community, and species-specific PCR was used to detect the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum. DGGE identified bacterial species in 59% of NGA and ETA samples combined. A diverse range of species were identified including several implicated in preterm labor. Species-specific PCR identified M. hominis in 25% of NGA and 11% of ETA samples. Among the 48 infants surviving up to 36 wk-postconceptual age, ordinal logistic regression showed the odds ratio for BPD or death where Ureaplasma was present/absent as 4.80 (95% CI 1.15-20.13). After adjusting for number of days ventilated, this was reduced to 2.04 (0.41-10.25). These data demonstrate how the combined use of DGGE and species-specific PCR identifies a high exposure in utero and around the time of birth to bacteria that might be causally related to preterm delivery and subsequent lung injury.",M1
20004912,"Maternal preeclampsia predicts the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that exposure to preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 107 babies born between 23 and 32 weeks gestation, collecting maternal, neonatal, and placental data. RESULTS: Of the 107 infants studied, 27 (25%) developed BPD. The bivariate odds ratio (OR) for the relationship between pre-eclampsia and BPD was 2.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 7.51; P = .01). When controlling for gestational age, birth weight z-score, chorioamnionitis, and other clinical confounders, the OR of developing BPD was 18.7 (95% CI = 2.44 to 144.76). Including the occurrence of preeclampsia, clinical chorioamnionitis, male sex, and maternal tobacco use in addition to gestational age and birth weight z-score accounted for 54% of the variability of the odds of developing BPD. CONCLUSIONS: BPD is increased for infants exposed to preeclampsia. This has possible implications for the prevention of BPD with proangiogenic agents, such as vascular endothelial growth factor.",M1
20004153,"[Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and prematurity. Short-and long-term respiratory changes]Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is the most frequent chronic lung disease in premature children. With the inclusion of antenatal steroid therapy, surfactant use and novel mechanical ventilation strategies, survival of premature newborns has increased, whereupon the incidence of BPD has not only decreased but has also risen in extremely premature newborns. This has led to a high respiratory morbidity in the first 2-3 years of life, with numerous admissions to hospital and respiratory exacerbations mostly due to viral infections. Although there is a trend towards improvement, during school age and adolescence, respiratory symptoms may persist, due to changes in pulmonary function often showing a lower exercise capacity. Although BPD symptoms are similar to those of asthma, as there is limitation in airflow and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), pathophysiological mechanisms could be different in both diseases. On the other hand, isolated prematurity plays an important role in the child's respiratory pathology, proving that pulmonary function alterations in preterm children are present since the first months of life. A higher respiratory morbidity has also been observed in these children when compared to full-term newborns, not only during the first years of life but also subsequently. In this study, different aspects of chronic respiratory disease associated with prematurity will be analysed, drawing special attention to clinical symptoms, respiratory function changes, BHR and exercise capacity. All these aspects will be reviewed from early childhood until adolescence and young adult age. Similarities and differences between BPD and asthma will also be discussed.",M1
20003836,"Exercise capacity of children with pediatric lung disease.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary function of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is similar at rest even though the mechanisms of injury differ. We sought to compare the peak exercise responses in children with BPD versus CF while controlling for pulmonary impairment, nutritional status, gender, age, height, and predicted forced expired volume in 1 second (approximately 73% of predicted). METHODS: Nine BPD children and 9 CF children underwent spirometry and a progressive exercise test to maximum on a cycle ergometer. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in body mass percentile (CF:97 +/- 13%, BPD: 98 +/- 11%), peak power output (Wpeak) (CF:67 +/- 19 W, BPD:73 +/- 28 W), % predicted Wpeak (CF:83 +/- 28%, BPD:88 +/- 15%), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak, CF: 38 +/- 7 ml/kg/min, BPD: 39 +/-6 ml/kg/min), or % predicted VO2peak (CF:99 +/- 16 %, BPD:96 +/- 27%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild pulmonary impairments are able to achieve a near normal peak power output and a normal VO2peak. Neither the aetiology nor the developmental onset of the process appears to be important influences on VO2peak or Wpeak.",M1
19921992,"Antenatal steroid treatment reduces childhood asthma risk in very low birth weight infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) and very low birth weight (VLBW) are associated with increased incidences of asthma and pulmonary dysfunction in childhood. However, no studies exist which examine asthma risk factors in children who were VLBW infants and did not have BPD. To address this issue, we assessed the asthma incidence and risk factors for asthma in 117 children (approximate mean age of 5 years) who were VLBW [&lt;1500 g, mean gestational age (GA): 30 weeks] infants without BPD. The risk factors were both perinatal (such as steroid treatment, mechanical ventilation, surfactant treatment) and environmental (parental smoking, pet adoption, etc). The asthma incidence was 18.8%. Following multivariate analysis, it was determined that a family history of atopy was a strong risk factor for childhood asthma. Maternal antenatal steroid treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk for asthma. GA and birth weight were not predictive of childhood asthma. These findings indicate that a history of familial atopy and antenatal steroid treatment are positively and negatively associated (independent of BPD) with childhood asthma in VLBW infants. The finding regarding antenatal steroid treatment warrants more extensive investigations.",M1

19841125,"Economic evaluation of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.OBJECTIVE: In the previously reported Nitric Oxide for Chronic Lung Disease (NO CLD) trial, ventilated preterm infants who received a course of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) between 7 and 21 days of life had a significant improvement in survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), as well as a shorter duration of admission and ventilation. However, the price for the drug may be a barrier to widespread use. We sought to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of iNO therapy to prevent BPD in infants of &lt;1250 g birth weight. METHODS: We used patient-level data from the NO CLD randomized trial. The study took a third-party payer perspective and measured costs and effects through hospital discharge. We applied previously reported hospital per-diem costs stratified according to intensity of ventilatory support, nitric oxide costs from standard market prices, and professional (physician) fees from the Medicare fee schedule. We compared log transformed costs by using multivariable modeling and performed incremental cost-effectiveness analysis with estimation of uncertainty through nonparametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: The mean cost per infant was $193125 in the placebo group and $194702 in the iNO group (adjusted P = .17). The point estimate for the incremental cost per additional survivor without BPD was $21297. For infants in whom iNO was initiated between 7 and 14 days of life, the mean cost per infant was $187407 in the placebo group and $181525 in the iNO group (adjusted P = .46). In this group of early treated infants, there was a 71% probability that iNO actually decreased costs while improving outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher price relative to many other neonatal therapies, iNO in this trial was not associated with higher costs of care, an effect that is likely due to its impact on length of stay and ventilation. Indeed, for infants who receive nitric oxide between 7 and 14 days of life, the therapy seemed to lower costs while improving outcomes.",M1
19840295,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and brain white matter damage in the preterm infant: a complex relationship.We analysed the relationship between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) and brain white matter damage (WMD) in very preterm infants, adjusting for common risk factors and confounders. We studied a cohort of infants &lt;32 weeks gestational age (GA) and &lt;1500 g, admitted to 12 hospitals in Northern Italy in 1999-2002. The association between BPD and WMD was estimated by generalised estimating equations and conditional logistic models, adjusting for centre, GA, propensity score for prolonged ventilation and other potential confounders. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) were used to depict the underlying causal structure and guide analysis. Of the 1209 infants reaching 36 weeks, 192 (15.8%) developed BPD (supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks) and 88 (7.3%) ultrasound-defined WMD (cystic periventricular leukomalacia). In crude analysis, BPD was a strong risk factor for WMD [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9]. With successive adjustments, the OR progressively decreased to 3.88 when adjusting for GA, to 2.72 adding perinatal risk factors, and further down to 2.16 [95% confidence interval 1.1, 3.9] when ventilation was also adjusted for. Postnatal factors did not change the OR. Significant risk factors for WMD, in addition to BPD, were a low GA, a lower Apgar score, a higher illness severity score, ventilation and early-onset sepsis, while antenatal steroids, being small for GA, and surfactant were associated with a reduced risk. In conclusion, our data suggest that BPD is associated with an increased risk of WMD; most of the effect is due to shared risk factors and causal pathways. DAGs helped clarify the complex confounding of this scenario.",M1
19833352,"Chorioamnionitis alters the response to surfactant in preterm infants.OBJECTIVE: To study the association between antenatal exposure to chorioamnionitis and the neonatal response to surfactant. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort of 301 preterm infants of gestational age &lt; or = 32.0 weeks, 146 of whom received surfactant according to standardized criteria. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) requirement (using analysis of variance) and time to extubation (using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses) were compared between groups based on the presence of histological chorioamnionitis (HC) with or without fetal involvement (HC-, n = 88; HC + F-, n = 25; HC + F+, n = 33) and between infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) or died (n = 57) and BPD-free survivors (n = 89). Multiple logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between HC and BPD. RESULTS: Compared with HC- infants, HC + F+ infants had significantly greater FiO(2) requirement and prolonged time to extubation postsurfactant, not accounted for by differences in gestational age and birth weight. Infants with BPD/death had a strikingly similar pattern of increased FiO(2) requirement postsurfactant. Moreover, in infants who received surfactant, HC + F+ status was associated with increased risk for BPD (odds ratio [OR] = 3.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-11.3; P = .047) and for BPD/death (OR = 2.72; 95% CI = 1.00-7.42; P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: An impaired surfactant response was observed in preterm infants with severe chorioamnionitis and may be involved in the association between chorioamnionitis, mechanical ventilation, and the development of BPD.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: We compared the respective z-scores of the weight, length and head circumference of extremely low-gestational-age infants (aged &lt;28 weeks) with BPD at birth, 40 weeks and 20 months corrected age (CA) during two time periods, namely period I, 1996-1999 (n=117) and period II, 2000-2003 (n=105), and examined the effects of significant changes in neonatal practice, morbidities and neurosensory outcome on 20-month growth outcomes. RESULT: During the most recent period (2000-2003), there was a significant increase in mean weight z-scores (-1.60 vs -1.22) and decrease in rates of subnormal weight (40 vs 21%), P&lt;0.05 at 20 months CA but not in those of length or head circumference. Significant predictors of the 20-month weight z-score included time period (period I vs II), duration of ventilator dependence and 20-month neurosensory abnormality (all P&lt;0.05).

19797161,"Lysyl oxidase activity is dysregulated during impaired alveolarization of mouse and human lungs.RATIONALE: Disordered extracellular matrix production is a feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). The basis of this phenomenon is not understood. OBJECTIVES: To assess lysyl oxidase expression and activity in the injured developing lungs of newborn mice and of prematurely born infants with BPD or at risk for BPD. METHODS: Pulmonary lysyl oxidase and elastin gene and protein expression were assessed in newborn mice breathing 21 or 85% oxygen, in patients who died with BPD or were at risk for BPD, and in control patients. Signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) was preemptively blocked in mice exposed to hyperoxia using TGF-beta-neutralizing antibodies. Lysyl oxidase promoter activity was assessed using plasmids containing the lox or loxl1 promoters fused upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: mRNA and protein levels and activity of lysyl oxidases (Lox, LoxL1, LoxL2) were elevated in the oxygen-injured lungs of newborn mice and infants with BPD or at risk for BPD. In oxygen-injured mouse lungs, increased TGF-beta signaling drove aberrant lox, but not loxl1 or loxl2, expression. Lox expression was also increased in oxygen-injured fibroblasts and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Lysyl oxidase expression and activity are dysregulated in BPD in injured developing mouse lungs and in prematurely born infants. In developing mouse lungs, aberrant TGF-beta signaling dysregulated lysyl oxidase expression. These data support the postulate that excessive stabilization of the extracellular matrix by excessive lysyl oxidase activity might impede the normal matrix remodeling that is required for pulmonary alveolarization and thereby contribute to the pathological pulmonary features of BPD.",M1
19793629,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: definitions and long-term respiratory outcome.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is a chronic respiratory disease that develops as a consequence of perinatal/neonatal lung injury, and it is one of the most important sequelae of premature birth. In this article we discuss recent changes in the definition of BPD, the main differences between the old and the new form and we summarize recent data on long-term respiratory outcome. The diagnosis of BPD is currently based on the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days after birth, and its severity is graded according to the respiratory support required at 36 postmenstrual weeks. The  new BPD  is mainly a developmental disorder in which the immature lung fails to reach its full structural complexity. Longitudinal studies on children with BPD identified, at all ages, a greater need to use inhaled asthma medication and a significant airflow obstruction. Whether survivors of BPD and prematurity have a risk of developing a COPD-like phenotype with aging is a question that only lung function studies extended to middle-age and beyond will answer.",M1
19786727,"Pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) refers to a heterogeneous group of lung disorders in infants that is commonly associated with prematurity and surfactant deficiency. BPD results from the complex interplay between impairments in the premature lung such as surfactant deficiency, perinatal insults such as infection, and damage resulting from supportive care of the infant due to barotrauma or volutrauma from mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity from supplemental oxygen administration. These factors result in chronic inflammation in the infant lung with recurring cycles of lung damage and repair that may impair alveolarization and vascularization in the developing lungs. As our insight in how to treat BPD improves along with the ability to do so with developing technology and therapies, the underlying pathogenesis will also change. The term 'new' BPD is now commonly used, to describe the changes seen in the post-surfactant era. This discussion reviews the pathogenesis of BPD according to the current medical literature.",M1

19779697,"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid peptidomics suggests a possible matrix metalloproteinase-3 role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.BACKGROUND: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is an important diagnostic source to investigate molecular changes occurring in lung disorders. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the peptidomic profiles of BALF from premature neonates with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS: Samples were obtained on the 3rd day of life from 34 neonates with gestational age &lt;or=32 weeks. Two pools of samples from patients with and without BPD were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Several differentially expressed peptides were collected and sequenced. Moreover, samples from single donors were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to define the molecular mass values of various peptides and to quantify their expression. Levels of some matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors were also determined in single samples. RESULTS: Neonates of the BPD group (N = 16) showed significantly lower mean gestational age and birth weight with respect to the no-BPD group (N = 18; P &lt; 0.0001). Levels of six peptides were significantly higher in BPD patients (P &lt; 0.05). Two of them were identified as the albumin fragments 1-21 (2,428 Da) and 399-406 (956 Da). Levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) enzyme probably involved in albumin fragment generation were also significantly higher in the BPD group compared to the no-BPD group (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05). Levels of albumin fragments and MMP-3 showed a significant correlation (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that proteomic techniques can be applied to investigate the involvement of proteolytic enzymes on the airways of mechanically ventilated premature infants.",M1
19778283,"Lack of association between FXIII-Val34Leu, FVII-323 del/ins, and transforming growth factor beta1 (915G/T) gene polymorphisms and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a single-center study.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is a multifactorial disease of preterm infants that is characterized by airway injury, inflammation, and parenchymal remodeling. Extravascular fibrin deposits in septae and alveoli due to the altered fibrin turnover are the pathological hallmarks of BPD that strongly indicates the importance of the imbalance in the competing activities of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Activation of the coagulation cascade leads to intraalveolar fibrin deposition in many inflammatory pulmonary disorders. Increased fibrin formation or decreased fibrinolysis may cause extravascular fibrin deposition. We evaluated the association between FXIII-Val34Leu, FVII-323 del/ins, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta(1)) (915G/T) gene polymorphisms in patients with BPD. The study group consisted of 98 preterm infants with BPD. Ninety-four of the 192 preterm neonates were without BPD and sampled for the control group. Restriction fragment size analyses were performed by examining digested PCR products for FXIII-Val34Leu, FVII-323 del/ins, and TGF-beta(1) (915G/C) genotypes. No significant associations were found between FXIII-Val34Leu, FVII-323 del/ins, TGF-beta(1) (915G/C) gene polymorphisms and BPD phenotype in our population. Further studies with other genes are required for the identification of molecular predisposing factors for BPD that may help in the development of new treatments and hence might allow for targeting of this treatment to a  high-risk  subgroup, reducing unnecessary exposure to potentially harmful therapies.",M1

We hypothesized that early alterations in pulmonary expression of growth factors important for normal lung development would precede development of BPD. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from ventilated preterm infants (n = 62) on postnatal d 0, 1, 3, and 7 and analyzed for total phospholipids (PL), VEGF, PDGF-BB, TGF-alpha and -beta1, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Levels (Ln transformed) were compared between infants developing BPD and BPD-free survivors, adjusted for potential confounders. BPD was associated with higher overall GM-CSF (beta (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.13;1.25); p &lt; 0.05), lower overall latent TGF-beta1 (beta (95% CI) = -1.19 (-1.87, -0.39); p &lt; 0.01) and total PL (beta (95% CI) = -0.64 (-1.23, -0.05); p &lt; 0.05), and lower d 0 and 3 levels of VEGF (mean difference (95% CI) = -1.75 (-2.72, -0.77), p &lt; 0.001; and -1.18 (-2.30, -0.06), p &lt; 0.05, respectively) and TGF-alpha (mean difference (95% CI) = -0.73 (-1.42, -0.04), p &lt; 0.05; and -1.01 (-1.64, -0.38), p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Day 0 VEGF levels had the highest predictive value for BPD (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.87; p &lt; 0.01).

The incidence of BPD has been increasing over the past two decades in parallel with an improvement in the survival of this population. Furthermore, the clinical characteristics and the natural history of infants affected by BPD have changed considerably, and newer definitions to clarify the term 'BPD' have also evolved since its first description more than four decades ago. Several drug therapies have also evolved, either to manage these infants' respiratory distress syndrome with an aim to prevent BPD or to manage the established condition. Although there is good evidence to support the 'routine' use of some therapies, many other therapies currently used in relation to BPD remain individual- or institution-specific, depending on beliefs and myths that we have adopted. In this article, we discuss the importance of defining BPD more objectively and the support--or lack thereof--for the drug therapies used in relation to BPD.",M1
19747889,"The 'new' bronchopulmonary dysplasia: challenges and commentary.Lung development is orchestrated by highly integrated morphogenic programs of interrelated patterns of gene and protein expression. Injury to the developing lung in the canalicular and saccular phases of lung development alters subsequent alveolar and vascular development resulting in simplified alveolar structures, dysmorphic capillary configuration, variable interstitial cellularity and fibroproliferation that are characteristic of the 'new' bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). Fetal and neonatal infection, abnormal stretch of the developing airways and alveoli, altered expression of surfactant proteins (or genetically altered proteins), polymorphisms of genes encoding for vascular endothelial growth factors, and reactive oxygen species result in imparied gas exchange in the developing lung. However, the 'new' BPD represents only one form of neonatal chronic lung disease and the consistent use of both the physiologic definition and severity scale would provide greater accuracy in determining the impact of the disease currently defined by its treatment. Our present labelling of the clinical state of oxygen supplementation and/or ventilatory support at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and the histopathologic severity of alveolar arrest and vascular 'simplification' may not always be predictive of the degree of altered lung development and thus longer-term pulmonary function evaluations are needed to determine the impact of this disorder in specific infants. The proposed role of novel molecular therapies, and the combined effects of currently established therapies, as well as exogenous surfactant and inhaled nitric oxide or repetitive surfactant dosing, on the severity and incidence of new BPD hold considerable promise for reducing the long-term pulmonary morbidity among infants delivered prematurely.",M1

Unfortunately, most of these strategies have not been successful. To date, the only two treatments developed specifically to prevent BPD whose efficacy is supported by evidence from randomized, controlled trials are the parenteral administration of vitamin A and corticosteroids. Two other therapies, the use of caffeine for the treatment of apnea of prematurity and aggressive phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia, were evaluated for the improvement of other outcomes and found to reduce BPD. Cohort studies suggest that the use of continuous positive airway pressure as a strategy for avoiding mechanical ventilation might also be beneficial. Other therapies reduce lung injury in animal models but do not appear to reduce BPD in humans. The benefits of the efficacious therapies have been modest, with an absolute risk reduction in the 7-11% range. Further preventive strategies are needed to reduce the burden of this disease. However, each will need to be tested in randomized, controlled trials, and the expectations of new therapies should be modest reductions of the incidence of the disease.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study from a single level 3 neonatal intensive care unit. The study sample included infants born to mothers with histological chorioamnionitis (n=252). Total white blood cells (WBCs) after birth were measured. Leukocytosis was defined as a total WBC count &gt;30 000 per mm(3) in the first 2 days of life. Outcomes investigated included BPD and death. Both unadjusted and multivariable analyses were carried out. RESULT: After controlling for potential confounding variables, infants who developed a leukocytosis after birth had increased odds of BPD (4.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.0 to 10.3), but decreased odds of death (0.3, 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.90).

19699162,"Chronic lung disease of prematurity: a short history.Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) is commonly considered to be a consequence of assisted ventilation. However, prior to the description in 1967 of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), following ventilator therapy for respiratory distress syndrome, Wilson-Mikity syndrome (WMS) had been described in very preterm infants on minimal oxygen supplementation. In the 1970s and 1980s, many infants treated with assisted ventilation required prolonged mechanical ventilation after developing radiographic features of coarse infiltrates, severe hyperinflation, and microcystic changes, associated with hypercarbemia and the need for increased inspired oxygen concentrations. Some infants died and showed evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive bronchiolitis, and dysplastic change. The role of supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and the immaturity of the lung have long been considered important in the etiology of CLD/BPD. More recently, the role of inflammation (particularly antenatal exposure to cytokines) and individual susceptibility (genetic predisposition) have assumed greater etiologic importance. The historical setting into which corticosteroid treatment for BPD was introduced is also discussed. After the licensing of exogenous surfactant to treat RDS in the early 1990s and more widespread use of prenatal corticosteroids in the mid-1990s, severe BPD became an unusual event. Gradually, the diagnosis of CLD, still often referred to as BPD, was based on an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. However, it is not clear that this 'new BPD' is substantially different from WMS. It is difficult to make prognostications about long-term lung function of these infants based on oxygen 'requirement' at 36 weeks, since supplemental oxygen is frequently used unnecessarily.",M1

Limited information is available on the outcomes of infants managed with SNIPPV. OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of infants managed with SNIPPV (postextubation or for apnea) to infants not treated with SNIPPV at 2 sites. METHODS: Clinical retrospective data was used to evaluate the use of SNIPPV in infants &lt;or=1250 g birth weight (BW); and 3 BW subgroups (500-750, 751-1000, and 1001-1250 g, decided a priori). SNIPPV was not assigned randomly. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) was defined as treatment with supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. RESULTS: Overall, infants who were treated with SNIPPV had significantly lower mean BW (863 vs 964 g) and gestational age (26.4 vs 27.9 weeks), more frequently received surfactant (85% vs 68%), and had a higher incidence of BPD or death (39% vs 27%) (all P &lt; .01) compared with infants treated with NCPAP. In the subgroup analysis, SNIPPV was associated with lower rates of BPD (43% vs 67%; P = .03) and BPD/death (51% vs 76%; P = .02) in the 500- to 750-g infants, with no significant differences in the other BW groups. Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for significant covariates, revealed infants with 500-700-g BW who received SNIPPV were significantly less likely to have the outcomes of BPD (OR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.11-0.77]; P = .01), BPD/death (OR: 0.30 [95% CI: 0.11-0.79]; P = .01), neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) (OR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.09-0.94]; P = .04), and NDI/death (OR: 0.18 [95% CI: 0.05-0.62]; P = .006).

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Pediatrix database for neonates of 23 to 32 weeks' gestation managed during 1997-2006 (N = 77520). We compared the use of DEX, HC and BPD (defined by oxygen use at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) according to year and estimated gestational age. Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) was used to compare the trends in steroid use and BPD rates according to year. RESULTS: There were no differences by year in the proportion of births at each gestation or in early or late neonatal death. DEX use decreased from a peak of 25.0% in 1998 to 6.8% in 2006, but HC use increased from 1.1% in 1997 to a peak of 6.5% in 2006. The median age at initiation of DEX use increased &gt;2 weeks from 1997 to 2006. BPD rates increased from 19% in 1997 to 25% by 2006. Rates for severe BPD (defined by positive pressure support) also increased significantly over time. Between 23 and 28 weeks, there was a significant increase in BPD rates associated with the decrease in DEX over time. CONCLUSIONS: Steroid use and preference have changed significantly over the past decade. Decreased use of DEX was associated with increased rates of BPD, any or severe, among very preterm infants. Well-designed, randomized, noncrossover trials with long-term outcome analysis of high-risk infants are needed.",M1

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Ten regions from nine countries participating in the 'Models of Organising Access to Intensive Care for Very Preterm Babies in Europe' (MOSAIC) project. POPULATION: All births from 22 to 29 weeks of gestation (n = 4146) in 2003, excluding terminations of pregnancy. METHODS: Comparison of three obstetric interventions (antenatal corticosteroids, antenatal transfer and caesarean section for fetal indication) rates at 22-23, 24-25 and 26-27 weeks to that at 28-29 weeks and the association of the level of intervention with pregnancy outcome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of antenatal corticosteroids, antenatal transfer and caesarean section by two-week gestational age groups as well as a composite score of these three interventions. Outcomes included stillbirth, in-hospital mortality and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) grades III and IV and/or periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). RESULTS: There were large differences between regions in interventions for births at 22-23 and 24-25 weeks. Differences were most pronounced at 24-25 weeks; in some regions these babies received the same care as babies of 28-29 weeks, whereas elsewhere levels of intervention were distinctly lower. Before 26 weeks and especially at 24-25 weeks, there was an association between the composite intervention score and mortality. No association was observed at 26-27 weeks. For survivors at 24-25 weeks, the intervention score was associated with higher rates of BPD, but not with IVH or PVL. CONCLUSIONS: There are large differences between European regions in obstetric practices at the lower limit of viability and these are related to outcome, especially at 24-25 weeks.",M1
19581835,"Placental IL-10 dysregulation and association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia risk.Cytokine profiles in amniotic fluid, cord serum, and tracheal aspirate of premature infants suggest a shift toward a proinflammatory state. Cytokines also contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). We hypothesize that the initiating events for BPD are reflected in the placenta and propose that placental expression of cytokines provide a blueprint of events leading to BPD. This is a retrospective, case-controlled study of placental cytokines of premature infants with (n = 49) and without (n = 49) BPD, matched for gender, birth weight, and year of birth at Women and Infants Hospital between 2003 and 2005. Cytokine expression, including IL-6 and IL-10, was determined by immunohistochemistry in membrane rolls, umbilical cords, and placentas. IL-6 was similarly expressed in all tissues of infants with and without BPD. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was less prominent in the placenta of patients with BPD compared with those without BPD. IL-10 expression in the villous trophoblast layer was associated with a reduced odds ratio of developing BPD (adjusted OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.70, p = 0.02). These results suggest that a placental balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is crucial to normal lung organogenesis.

Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that reduced numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells at birth are associated with the development of BPD. METHODS: We studied ninety-eight preterm infants with gestational age of less than 32 weeks or a birth weight less than 1,500 g. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were assessed by clonogenic analysis in infants for whom cord blood was available. The proportion of circulating endothelial and hematopoietic cells was measured by flow cytometry at birth, at 48 hours, and at 7 days of life. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ECFCs in cord blood were lower in infants who later developed BPD (median [range]: 0.00 [0.00-0.48] vs. 2.00 [0.00-21.87]; P = 0.002). ECFCs decreased with decreasing gestational age (r = 0.41; P = 0.02), but even at extremely low gestational ages, infants with higher numbers of ECFCs were protected from BPD. The endothelial and hematopoietic cell subsets studied by flow cytometry were comparable in infants with and without BPD and rapidly decreased after birth. CONCLUSIONS: ECFCs are low at extremely low gestational ages and increase during gestation; extremely preterm infants who display lower numbers at birth have an increased risk of developing BPD. Our findings suggest that decreased ECFCs following extremely preterm birth may be associated with the risk for developing lung vascular immaturity characteristic of new BPD.",M1

The study aimed to evaluate: 1) somatic development, 2) psychomotor development, 3) parental opinion of health status of the child and 4) prevalence of bronchial hyperreactivity among 5-7 years old children with history of BPD. METHODS: Case-control study included 56 newborns born &lt; or =32 weeks of gestation with mean birthweight (SD) 1057+/-218g. BPD was defined as at least 28 days of oxygen therapy and oxygen or positive pressure support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. The control group consisted of newborns matched by sex, birthweight (+/-100g), gestational age (+/-1 weeks) and year of hospitalization. Somatic and psychomotor developments were prospectively evaluated up to age of 5-7 years. Parents were asked to complete two questionnaires: one assessing normal daily activity of the child and the standardized questionnaire used by International Study of Asthma and Allergies In Childhood (ISAAC). Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) before and after the inhalation of betamimetic were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant difference in somatic development was found between the study group and the control group. Normal psychomotor development was diagnosed in 11 (39%) children with BPD and in 13(46%) children without BPD. Mild or moderate impairment was diagnosed in 12 (43%) cases and 13 (36%) controls, and severe impairment in 5 (18%) and 2 (7%) children. At the age of 5-7 years children with BPD presented lower IQ as compared to children without BPD (94+/-25 vs. 103+/-16, p= 0.2). Parents of children with BPD more often declared that their child's development is impaired (39% vs. 11%, OR: 4.96; 95%CI: 1.2-20). Wheezing in past history was noted in 18 cases (64%) and only in 10 (35%) children without BPD (OR: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.09-9.67).

Moreover, changes of PEFR after a dose of betamimetic were similar in both groups (21% vs. 19%, p=0.7). CONCLUSION: The intellectual development of children with BPD at the age of 5-7 is worse than in the control group, especially as declared by their parents. Episodes of wheezing in infancy occurred more frequently in the group of children with BPD. However, bronchial hyperreactivity at the age of 5-7 is not significantly more frequent.",M1
19485250,"[Prevalence and risk factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia among extremely low birth weight newborns of regional birth cohort of south-east Poland]BACKGROUND: Advances in intensive health care within the last 30 years have resulted in increased survival of most immature neonates. The results of epidemiological studies indicate, however, that late complications of prematurity, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), have become more frequent since the late 1990s. The identification of risk factors predisposing to severe BPD might help in developing treatment methods directed at the group of children with high risk of developing the disease. AIM: Analysis of prevalence and risk factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia among extremely low birth weight newborns of regional birth cohort of south-east Poland. METHODS: The study included newborns of birth weight &lt; or = 1000g born in south-east district of Poland within one calendar year. The data assessed were: the need of oxygen therapy of at least 28 days' duration and the need of oxygen therapy at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA). RESULTS: During the study period 109 newborns with birth weight &lt; or = 1000g) were hospitalized in three third-level departments of neonatology in south-east Poland. The final assessment for BPD included 56 children (51%), whose mean birth weight was 839g (SD: 128) and mean gestational age was 27.3 weeks (SD: 2.2). Thirty-nine children (70%) required oxygen therapy for at least 28 days, and 27 children (48%) required oxygen therapy at 36 weeks of PMA. Gestational age of the newborn, the need of respiratory support at birth, and the need of surgical treatment of PDA were found to be independent risk factors of oxygen therapy lasting for at least 28 days. Only the need of respiratory support at 7 days of life and the need for surgical treatment of PDA were found to be independent risk factors of oxygen therapy at the 36 weeks of PMA. CONCLUSION: The analysis of several risk factors of BPD in children with birth weight &lt; or =1000g revealed that the need for respiratory support at seven days of life is a major risk factor of developing chronic respiratory disease. The risk of BPD may be significantly reduced by adequate care aimed at shortening the time of conventional respiratory support and at limiting the persistence of ductus arteriosus.",M1
19469116,"[Is it possible to predict the success of pharmacological closure of persistent ductus arteriosus in prematurely born neonates?]BACKGROUND: Haemodynamically significant persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with left-to-right shunting causes overload of the pulmonary circulation and results in prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen dependence. Among other options, pharmacological closure using cyclooxygenase inhibitors remains popular among neonatologists. The purpose of the study was to assess the importance of factors affecting the outcome of the aforementioned strategy. METHODS: Charts of neonates with respiratory failure treated with indomethacin for PDA were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with other heart abnormalities and those with delayed PDA therapy were excluded. RESULTS: 83 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median birth weight was 1000 g (interquartile range--IQR 800-1320), and gestational age was 27 weeks (IQR 26-30). The overall success rate of primary treatment with indomethacin was 57%. Surgical PDA ligation was performed in 32%. Factors which contributed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) to the failure of indomethacin treatment were: each 10 mL kg(-1) of intravenous fluid administration that exceeded the total amount of 100 mL kg(-1) 24h(-1), odds ratio (OR) 1.12; a PDA diameter/body mass index (OR 1.93); and gestational age (OR 0.78). In a multivariate model, the following factors were found significant: gestational age OR 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.95) and i.v. fluid excess OR 1.14 (95% CI 1.02-1.27). In patients with primary treatment failure a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) (67% vs. 36% p = 0.006), and combined BPD or death (72% vs 42.5% p = 0.01) were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of successful treatment with indomethacin is possible on the basis of gestational age and daily fluid intake. These factors should be considered when considering the risk/benefit of indomethacin therapy.",M1
19468239,"Activation of T cells in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.BACKGROUND: Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) present with systemic inflammation. The role of lymphocytes in RDS is less studied. Activation of lymphocytes could mediate chronic inflammation and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether T cells are activated in preterm infants with RDS and whether T cell activation is associated with the development of BPD. METHODS: Thirty-four infants with RDS [mean gestational age 27.1 (SD 2.0) weeks, birth weight 900 (216) g] were compared with 21 infants without RDS [32.6 (1.4) weeks, 1,697 (406) g]. From blood samples taken on postnatal days 1, 3, and 7, CD4 and CD8 cell counts and their expressions of co-stimulatory molecule CD54 and adhesion molecule CD62L were determined by flow cytometry. In activated cells, expression of CD54 is increased and CD62L is decreased. RESULTS:As compared with infants without RDS, infants with RDS had less CD4 and CD8 cells on day 3 (both p = 0.02). On day 1 and day 3, RDS was associated with increased CD54 expression on CD4 cells (p = 0.001; p = 0.03) and decreased CD62L expression on CD8 cells (both p = 0.02). Infants with RDS who developed BPD (n = 18) had higher CD54 expression on CD4 cells on day 3 (p = 0.01) and on CD8 cells on day 1 and day 3 (p = 0.01; p = 0.04) as compared with infants without BPD (n = 16). CONCLUSIONS: In preterm infants, RDS is associated with a lower T cell count and a higher proportion of activated cells. Increased proportion of activated T cells predicts the development of BPD. Systemic T cell activation could mediate inflammation and development of BPD.",M1
19399006,"Synthetic surfactants: where are we? Evidence from randomized, controlled clinical trials.The benefits of exogenous synthetic or animal-derived surfactants for prevention or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) are well established. Data from head-to-head trials comparing animal-derived surfactants primarily with the synthetic surfactant colfosceril suggest that the major clinical advantages afforded by the presence of surfactant protein (SP)-B and SP-C in animal-derived preparations relate to faster onset of action, a reduction in the incidence of RDS when used prophylactically, and a lower incidence of air leaks and RDS-related deaths. However, no benefits in terms of overall mortality or <e>BPD</e> have been shown in these head-to-head comparisons. Findings from trials of a new-generation synthetic surfactant containing a peptide that mimics SP-B, as well as their follow-up study suggest that its administration improves short-term clinical outcomes compared with colfosceril and results in survival through 1 year of age, which is at least comparable, if not perhaps superior, to that seen with animal-derived surfactants.",M1
19412586,"Prospective population-based study of RSV-related intermediate care and intensive care unit admissions in Switzerland over a 4-year period (2001-2005).OBJECTIVES: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are a leading cause of hospital admissions in small children. A substantial proportion of these patients require medical and nursing care, which can only be provided in intermediate (IMC) or intensive care units (ICU). This article reports on all children aged &lt; 3 years who required admission to IMC and/or ICU between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2005 in Switzerland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data on all children aged &lt; 3 years who were admitted to an IMC or ICU for an RSV-related illness. Using a detailed questionnaire, we collected information on risk factors, therapy requirements, length of stay in the IMC/ICU and hospital, and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 577 cases reported during the study period, 90 were excluded because the patients did not fulfill the inclusion criteria; data were incomplete in another 25 cases (5%). Therefore, a total of 462 verified cases were eligible for analysis. At the time of hospital admission, only 31 patients (11%) were older than 12 months. Since RSV infection was not the main reason for IMC/ICU admission in 52% of these patients, we chose to exclude this subgroup from further analyses. Among the 431 infants aged &lt; 12 months, the majority (77%) were former near term or full term (NT/FT) infants with a gestational age &gt; or = 35 weeks without additional risk factors who were hospitalized at a median age of 1.5 months. Gestational age (GA) &lt; 32 weeks, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), and congenital heart disease (CHD) were all associated with a significant risk increase for IMC/ICU admission (relative risk 14, 56, and 10, for GA &lt; or = 32 weeks, BPD, and CHD, respectively). Compared with NT/FT infants, high-risk infants were hospitalized at an older age (except for infants with CHD), required more invasive and longer respiratory support, and had longer stays in the IMC/ICU and hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, RSV infections lead to the IMC/ICU admission of approximately 1%-2% of each annual birth cohort. Although prematurity, BPD, and CHD are significant risk factors, non-pharmacological preventive strategies should not be restricted to these high-risk patients but also target young NT/FT infants since they constitute 77% of infants requiring IMC/ICU admission.",M1
19410441,"[Glucocorticoide therapy in premature infants: French practices in 2006]BACKGROUND AND AIM: In 1999, 80% of French neonatal centers used corticosteroids, mainly betamethasone (BMT), to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) [Lee SK, McMillan DD, Ohlson A, et al. Variations in practice and outcomes in the canadian NICU Network 1996-1997. Pediatrics 2000;106:1070-9]. As many data suggested a low risk-benefit ratio, an updated assessment of this use was necessary [Desnoulez L, Empana J, Anceschi M, et al.

The effects of early postnatal dexamethasone therapy on pulmonary outcome in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a 2-year follow-up study. Acta Paediatr 2005;94:310-16]. METHODS: Questionnaires addressing the use of and indications for corticosteroids were sent to all French neonatal centers. RESULTS: The study was conducted over 5 months (July to November 2006). Of 202 questionnaires sent out, 186 (92%) were completed. Of these 186 centers, 147 (79%) had a standard protocol for corticosteroid use, covering systemic and inhaled steroids (76 units), only systemic steroid therapy (30 units) and only inhaled steroids (41 units). Systemic corticosteroids were used in 106 centers for hemodynamic purposes in 42 cases (40%), prevention of BPD in 1 case (1%), early treatment of BPD (day 4 to day 21) in 23 cases (22%) and late treatment of BPD (after day 21) in 74 cases (70%). Hemisuccinate hydrocortisone (HSHC) was the only corticoid used for hemodynamic failure. The steroid used for early treatment of BPD was BMT (21 out of 23). The duration of treatment was less than 4 days in 10 centers (43%). The steroid most often used for late treatment was BMT (67 out of 74). The duration of treatment was less than 4 days in 29 centers, between 4 and 8 days in 22 centers, and longer than 8 days in 26 centers. Among 117 centers administering corticosteroids by inhalation, 74% used budesonide. Use of corticosteroids was higher in teaching hospitals (86%) than in others (49%), likely due to the immaturity of the neonates hospitalized in these centers. CONCLUSION: We showed a still frequent use of corticosteroids in preterm infants in France but only after the fourth day of life to treat BPD and not as a prevention therapy. We also found a marginal use of DXM in accordance with both short-term and long-term adverse side effects, suggesting an unbalanced risk-benefit ratio even though it has a beneficial effect on respiratory status. Our findings indicate the need for national recommendations and trials to assess oral BMT treatment in premature neonates with BPD.",M1
19395393,"Changes in care and outcome of very preterm babies in the Parisian region between 1998 and 2003.OBJECTIVE: To assess evolution in the care and health of very preterm babies between 1998 and 2003 after implementation of a regionalisation policy in France. DESIGN: Comparison of two population-based cohorts. SETTING: The Parisian region. PATIENTS: All live births at 24-31 weeks of gestation in 1997 (EPIPAGE study, n=488) and in 2003 (MOSAIC study, n=580). Interventions Implementation of regionalised perinatal networks. Main outcome measures In-hospital mortality and morbidity, including intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) grade III and IV, cystic periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). RESULTS: Over this period, babies born in level III units rose from 67% to 77% and use of antenatal corticosteroids, indicated deliveries and surfactant increased. In-hospital mortality and IVH grades III/IV declined, ORs of 0.66 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.95) and 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.47), respectively, while PVL and BPD stayed constant. The rate of very preterm babies discharged alive per 1000 total births increased by 18%, but declined for babies with severe brain lesions.

19383857,"Relation of exhaled nitric oxide levels to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that exhaled nitric oxide levels on day 28 and changes in exhaled nitric oxide levels in the neonatal period would differ according to whether infants developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) and its severity. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: 80 infants (median gestational age 28, range 24-32 weeks), 46 of whom developed BPD. INTERVENTIONS: Exhaled nitric oxide measurements were attempted on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BPD (oxygen dependency at 28 days), mild BPD (oxygen dependent at 28 days, but not 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)); moderate BPD (oxygen dependent at 36 weeks PMA) and severe BPD (respiratory support dependent at 36 weeks PMA). RESULTS: On day 28, exhaled nitric oxide levels were higher in infants with BPD compared to those without BPD (p&lt;0.001) and there was a linear trend in exhaled nitric oxide results as BPD severity increased (p = 0.006). No significances in the change in exhaled nitric oxide levels over the neonatal period were found between the four groups. CONCLUSION: Exhaled nitric oxide levels are raised in infants with established BPD, particularly in those developing moderate or severe BPD, and may reflect ongoing inflammation.",M1
19381510,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight infants.OBJECTIVE: The developments in newborn care have enabled many more very low birth weight premature infants to live. The aim of our study was to determine the risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) development by evaluating mild and moderate/severe BPD in extramural neonates with a birth weight &lt;1501 g. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted between January 1, 2004- December 31, 2006 at the Dr. Sami Ulus Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patients with BPD and without BPD were compared. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed and classified according to the Bancalari criteria. One-hundred and six (106) extramural premature infants with a birth weight &lt;1501 g and admitted to the Neonatal Unit in the first three days of life and survived for more than 28 postnatal days were included. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies and complex cardiac pathologies were excluded. The maternal and neonatal risk factors, clinical features, mechanical ventilation treatment were compared. The principal risk factors for BPD development were analyzed and followed by logistic regression test. RESULTS: The diagnosis was mild BPD in 27 of the 106 patients and moderate/severe BPD in 29. The incidence of BPD was 52.8%. Fifty of 106 patients had no BPD. Analysis of risk factors revealed that gestational age &lt; or =28 weeks (p=0.019), birth weight &lt; or =1000 g (p=0.007), hypothermia (p=0.003), acidosis (p=0.003) and hypotension (p=0.005) at admission, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ( p&lt;0.001), mechanical ventilation therapy (p&lt;0.001), surfactant therapy (p=0.005), higher amount of mean fluid therapy on 7(th) days (p=0.008), nosocomial infection (p&lt;0.001), higher amount of mean packed red cell transfusions (p&lt;0.001) and more than two packed red cell transfusions (p=0.033) were risk factors associated with the development of BPD. Multivariant logistic regression analysis showed acidosis at admission (OR 5.12, 95%CI 1.17-22.27, p=0.029), surfactant treatment (OR 7.53, 95%CI 2.14-26.45, p=0.002), nosocomial infections (OR 4.66, 95%CI 1.27-17.12, p=0.02) and PDA (OR 9.60, 95%CI 2.23-41.22, p=0.002) were risk factors increasing the severity of BPD. CONCLUSION: The most important risk factors for BPD development in our study were RDS and nosocomial infections while the presence of acidosis at admission, surfactant administration, nosocomial infections and the presence of PDA were the most important risk factors regarding BPD severity. Presence of acidosis at admission as a risk factor emphasized the importance of suitable transport conditions for premature infants.",M1
19370695,"Animal derived surfactant extract for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant. A wide variety of surfactant products have been formulated and studied in clinical trials. These include synthetic surfactants and animal derived surfactant extracts. Trials of surfactant replacement have either tried to prevent the development of respiratory distress in high-risk premature infants or treat established respiratory distress in premature infants. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of administration of animal derived surfactant extract on mortality, chronic lung disease and other morbidities associated with prematurity in preterm infants with established respiratory distress syndrome. Subgroup analysis were planned according to the specific surfactant product, the degree of prematurity, and the severity of disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from 1975 through December 2008. In addition, searches were made of previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching in the English language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quazi-randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of animal derived surfactant extract treatment administered to infants with established respiratory distress syndrome in order to prevent complications of prematurity and mortality. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data regarding clinical outcomes were excerpted from the reports of the clinical trials by the review authors. Data analysis was done in accordance with the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. The studies demonstrated an initial improvement in respiratory status (improved oxygenation and decreased need for ventilator support). The meta-analysis supports a significant decrease in the risk of any air leak (typical relative risk 0.47, 95% CI 0.39, 0.58; typical risk difference -0.16, 95% CI -0.21, -0.12), pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.42, 95% CI 0.34, 0.52; typical risk difference -0.17, 95% CI -0.21, -0.13), and a significant decrease in the risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (typical relative risk 0.45, 95% CI 0.37, 0.55; typical risk difference -0.20, 95% CI -0.25, -0.15). There is a significant decrease in the risk of neonatal mortality (typical relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.57, 0.82; typical risk difference -0.09, 95% CI -0.13, -0.05), a significant decrease in the risk of mortality prior to hospital discharge (typical relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.44, 0.90; typical risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.18, -0.03) and a significant decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) or death at 28 days of age (typical relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.77, 0.90; typical risk difference -0.11, 95 CI -0.16, -0.06). No differences are reported in the risk of patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, BPD or retinopathy of prematurity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Infants with established respiratory distress syndrome who receive animal derived surfactant extract treatment have a decreased risk of pneumothorax, a decreased risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, a decreased risk of mortality, and a decreased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death.",M1
19332995,"Amniotic fluid transforming growth factor-beta1 and the risk for the development of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Chorioamnionitis (CAM) can initiate fetal lung injury resulting in neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). While neonates with BPD have higher amniotic fluid concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) also appears important in the pathogenesis of BPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TGF-beta(1) and CAM-induced fetal lung injury. Forty-four amniotic fluid samples were obtained at delivery of preterm infants (median gestation, 28 weeks; birth weight, 908 g). TGF-beta(1) and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations in the amniotic fluid were measured with ELISA. Both TGF-beta(1) and IL-6 concentrations in the amniotic fluid increased with increasing histological severity of CAM (each p &lt; 0.0001). The presence of both BPD and histological CAM was associated with significantly higher amniotic fluid TGF-beta(1) and IL-6 concentrations than the presence of BPD without histological CAM, or the absence of both (each p &lt; 0.0001). Both concentrations also correlated with the duration of oxygen administration in the neonates (each p &lt; 0.0001). Amniotic fluid TGF-beta(1) seems to be important in CAM-induced fetal lung injury progressing to neonatal BPD.",M1
19324366,"The role of patent ductus arteriosus ligation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia: reexamining a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To reexamine data from a randomized controlled trial of prophylactic ductus ligation to determine whether ligation contributes directly to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) in extremely low birth weight infants. STUDY DESIGN: The control group underwent ligation only if they had development of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The Prophylactic Ligation group underwent ligation within 24 hours of birth regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms of a PDA. We hypothesized that the incidence of BPD would be higher in the prophylactic ligation group because more ligations were performed than in the control group. RESULTS: Prophylactic ligation significantly increased the incidence of BPD (defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age) and the incidence of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks. The groups were statistically similar in gestation, sex, race, fluid administration, intraventricular hemorrhage, pulmonary air leaks, and survival to 36 weeks. The lower incidence of BPD in the control group occurred despite the fact that the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (a known risk factor for BPD) was significantly elevated in the control group. Only infants who had previously undergone a PDA ligation had development of BPD in the control group. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic ligation, while eliminating the PDA, increases the risk for BPD.",M1

19213770,"School age outcome of hospitalisation with respiratory syncytial virus infection of prematurely born infants.BACKGROUND: Hospitalisation due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the first 2 years after birth has been associated with increased healthcare utilisation and associated costs up to 5 years of age in children born prematurely at less than 32 weeks of gestation who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). A study was undertaken to determine whether hospitalisation due to RSV infection in the first 2 years was associated with increased morbidity and lung function abnormalities in such children at school age, and if any effects were influenced by age. METHODS: Healthcare utilisation and cost of care in years 5-7 were reviewed in 147 children and changes in healthcare utilisation between 0 and 8 years were assessed also using results from two previous studies. At age 8-10 years, 77 children had their lung function assessed and bronchial hyper-responsiveness determined. RESULTS: Children hospitalised with RSV infection (n = 25) in the first 2 years had a greater cost of care related to outpatient attendance than those with a non-respiratory or no admission (n = 72) when aged 5-7 years (p = 0.008). At 8-10 years of age, children hospitalised with RSV infection (n = 14) had lower forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)) (p = 0.015), FEV(0.75)/forced vital capacity (p = 0.027) and flows at 50% (p = 0.034) and 75% (p = 0.006) of vital capacity than children hospitalised for non-RSV causes (n = 63). Healthcare utilisation decreased with increasing age regardless of RSV hospitalisation status. CONCLUSIONS: In prematurely born children who had BPD, hospitalisation due to RSV infection in the first 2 years is associated with reduced airway calibre at school age.",M1

One, 8, and 14 infants developed severe, moderate and mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), respectively, and 6 did not. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels in the cord blood were determined by ELISA. MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios in the cord blood of infants who developed severe or moderate BPD (n = 9) were significantly higher than those who developed mild BPD or did not develop BPD (n = 20; P = 0.015). Multivariate linear regressions demonstrated that MMP-9 levels and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios in the cord blood of the premature infants correlated with the oxygen supplementation period (r = 0.58, P = 0.003 and r = 0.41, P = 0.030, respectively). The MMP-9 levels and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios correlated with the severity of maternal chorioamnionitis (both trend P = 0.006).

19173193,"[Bronchopulmonary dysplasia -- early and long-term pulmonary sequelae]Improvement in perinatal care have resulted in significantly increased survival of premature infants. Discontinuation of correct intrauterine lung development and a necessity of oxygen-therapy and/or mechanical ventilation become a reason of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). In the first period of life the main complaint of these patients is oxygen dependence. Moreover the risk of serious infections of lower respiratory tract (particularly RSV) increases. This becomes the reason of readmission of about 50% prematures with diagnosed BPD in the first year of life. The main problem of these patients is airway obstruction, which very often doesn't respond to brochodilatators. The probable reason of these disturbances is imperfect development of respiratory system and remodelling of respiratory tract. Reduction in lung function (reduced FEV(1), PEF, FVC) persists until adolescence. Acceleration of the decrease in FEV(1)/FVC ratio may suggest that these patients are a risk group of COPD development. The assessment of lung radiography at the age of 11 years of former prematures with diagnosed BPD reveals the presence of persistent emphysematic changes (86% of these children had one or more bubbles). Abnormalities in chest high resolution CT occur in the majority of these patients (in 81.3% of the 10-years-olds group and in 92.5% of 18-year-olds group).

Fetal estradiol levels increase during late gestation and estradiol up-regulates NOS, suggesting that after preterm birth estradiol deprivation causes attenuated lung NOS resulting in impaired pulmonary function. OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of postnatal estradiol administration in a primate model of BPD over 14 days after delivery at 125 days of gestation (term = 185 d). METHODS: Cardiopulmonary function was assessed by echocardiography and whole body plethysmography. Lung morphometric and histopathologic analyses were performed, and NOS enzymatic activity and abundance were measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Estradiol caused an increase in blood pressure and ductus arteriosus closure. Expiratory resistance and lung compliance were also improved, and this occurred before spontaneous ductal closure. Furthermore, both oxygenation and ventilation indices were improved with estradiol, and the changes in lung function and ventilatory support requirements persisted throughout the study period. Whereas estradiol had negligible effect on indicators of lung inflammation and on lung structure assessed after the initial 14 days of ventilatory support, it caused an increase in lung neuronal and endothelial NOS enzymatic activity. CONCLUSIONS: In a primate model of BPD, postnatal estradiol treatment had favorable cardiovascular impact, enhanced pulmonary function, and lowered requirements for ventilatory support in association with an up-regulation of lung NOS. Estradiol may be an efficacious postnatal therapy to improve lung function and outcome in preterm infants.",M1
19131431,"Histological chorioamnionitis and respiratory outcome in preterm infants.A considerable body of human and animal experimental evidence links antenatal inflammation to both accelerated maturation and adverse development of the lung. Initial reports suggest that in preterm infants histological chorioamnionitis is associated with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), while the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is increased. Considerable variation exists in the findings of subsequent human studies, largely dependent on differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Taking these differences into account, recent studies generally seem to confirm the effect of chorioamnionitis on RDS incidence, while no effect on BPD is seen. The increased use of antenatal steroids and the diminished effects of secondary pro-inflammatory hits seem to explain part of this change. Additional research is needed to explore these complex interactions and their underlying mechanisms, and evaluate the long term pulmonary effects of antenatal inflammation.",M1
19127216,"Airway concentrations of angiopoietin-1 and endostatin in ventilated extremely premature infants are decreased after funisitis and unbalanced with bronchopulmonary dysplasia/death.A systemic inflammatory response of the fetus, reflected by histologic funisitis, is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). Impaired pulmonary angiogenesis accompanied by simplification and rarification of alveoli is a histologic hallmark of BPD. Angiopoietin-1 mediates vascular development, maturation, and stabilization. Endostatin mainly acts as an angiostatic factor. We hypothesized that funisitis was associated with changes of endostatin and angiopoietin-1 concentrations in the airways and that an imbalance between the factors might be associated with BPD or death. We measured concentrations of angiopoietin-1 and endostatin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid samples of 42 ventilated preterm infants during postnatal days 1 through 15. The secretory component for IgA served as reference protein. A standardized histologic examination was used to distinguish three groups: chorioamnionitis, funisitis, and controls without inflammation. Concentrations of the mediators steadily decreased. Funisitis was associated with lower concentrations of both proteins, which might impair their physiologic activities in pulmonary angiogenesis. An increase of the ratio angiopoietin-1/endostatin until day 7 of life indicated a shift of the mediators potentially favoring angiogenesis. However, infants, who developed BPD or died, had a decreased ratio on days 1, 3, and 15, suggesting an imbalance toward inhibition of pulmonary angiogenesis.",M1
19122464,"Hepatocyte growth factor treatment improves alveolarization in a newborn murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is thought to be one form of developmental arrest of the lung. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) participates in normal lung growth and in lung regeneration. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether HGF can improve alveolarization and attenuates functional abnormalities of a murine model of BPD induced by hyperoxia. METHODS: Three-day-old CD-1 mice were exposed to 90% of oxygen or room air (control group) for 7 days. These animals were then kept in room air for the next 7 days. Recombinant human (rh) HGF (100 microg/g b.w., divided 3 times, rhHGF group) or vehicle (vehicle group) was administered intraperitoneally during hyperoxia. On day 17, the pulmonary function test and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were examined. Mean linear intercepts (MLI) were measured as parameters of alveolarization. Cell renewal (on day 10) and vascularization of the lung were also evaluated. RESULTS: Exposure to hyperoxia induced increased airway resistance and BHR. These animals showed a severely simplified alveolar structure, increased MLI, decreased cell renewal (16.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 29.6 +/- 2.4%, p &lt; 0.05), and decreased vascularization (15.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 18.4 +/- 1.5 vessels/hpf, p &lt; 0.05, vehicle vs. control group, respectively). rhHGF treatment during exposure to hyperoxia significantly reduced all of these changes (27.9 +/- 1.7%, 18.2 +/- 0.5 vessels/hpf for cell renewal and vascularization, respectively; all values are p &lt; 0.05 against vehicle animals). CONCLUSION: HGF partially protects against the inhibition of alveolarization and improves functional abnormality in the hyperoxia-induced neonatal mice model of BPD.",M1
19097983,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 deficiency worsens lung injury in a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) in newborn infants, but the role of MMP-9 in the pathophysiology of BPD is unclear. We have shown that perinatal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the lung is sufficient to cause a BPD-like illness in infant mice. To study the hypothesis that MMP-9 is an important downstream mediator in IL-1 beta-induced lung injury in the newborn, we compared the effects of IL-1 beta on fetal and postnatal lung inflammation and development in transgenic mice with regulatable pulmonary overexpression of human mature IL-1 beta with wild-type (IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+)) or null (IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-)) MMP-9 loci. IL-1 beta increased the expression of MMP-9 mRNA and amount of MMP-9 protein in the lungs of MMP-9(+/+) mice. IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-) mice had fewer neutrophils but more macrophages in the lungs than did IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+) mice. MMP-9 deficiency increased pulmonary cell death and macrophage clearance of dying cells in IL-1 beta-expressing mice. IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-) mice had more severe alveolar hypoplasia than IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+) mice, implying that IL-1 beta-induced lung disease was worsened in the absence of MMP-9. These results suggest that MMP-9 activity in the inflamed neonatal lung protects the lung against injury.",M1
19085927,"Chest radiograph thoracic areas and lung volumes in infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether chest radiograph (CXR) thoracic areas and lung volumes differed between infants who did and did not develop <e>BPD</e> and according to the severity of BPD developed. WORKING HYPOTHESIS: Infants developing BPD, particularly if moderate or severe, would have low CXR thoracic areas and lung volumes in the perinatal period. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENT-SUBJECT SELECTION: 53 infants with a median gestational age of 28 (range 24-32) weeks. METHODOLOGY: CXR thoracic areas were calculated using a Picture Archiving and Communicating System (PACS) and lung volume assessed by measurement of functional residual capacity (FRC) in the first 72 hr after birth. BPD was diagnosed if the infants were oxygen dependent beyond 28 days, mild BPD in infants no longer oxygen dependent at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) and moderate/severe BPD in infants who required supplementary oxygen with or without respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA. RESULTS: Thirty two infants developed BPD, 21 had moderate/severe BPD. The median CXR thoracic areas were higher (P &lt; 0.0001) and FRCs were lower (P &lt; 0.0001) in the BPD compared to no BPD infants. The median CXR thoracic areas of the moderate/severe group (P &lt; 0.001) and the mild group (P &lt; 0.05) were greater than that of the no BPD group and the median FRC of the moderate/severe BPD group was lower than the no BPD group (&lt;0.001) and the mild BPD group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results highlight that in the perinatal period infants developing BPD, particularly if moderate/severe, have low functional lung volumes and may have gas trapping, which likely reflects ventilation inhomogeneity.",M1
19085566,"Altered pulmonary interleukin-6 signaling in preterm infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Interleukin (IL)-6 signaling depends on the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and the soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp130). To investigate the impact of IL-6 signaling on the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity (<e>BPD</e>), IL-6, sIL-6R, and sgp130 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in tracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Infants developing BPD showed increased concentrations of IL-6, sIL-6R, and sgp-130 in their first week of life. These infants also had significantly higher molar ratios for IL-6/sIL-6R and IL-6/sgp130. The authors conclude that altered interleukin-6 signaling via the soluble receptors sIL-6R and sgp130 may play an important role in pulmonary inflammation of preterm infants.",M1
19076373,"Gastrin-releasing peptide, immune responses, and lung disease.Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is produced by pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), with highest numbers of GRP-positive cells present in fetal lung. Normally GRP-positive PNECs are relatively infrequent after birth, but PNEC hyperplasia is frequently associated with chronic lung diseases. To address the hypothesis that GRP mediates chronic lung injury, we present the cumulative evidence implicating GRP in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), the chronic lung disease of premature infants who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome. The availability of well-characterized animal models of BPD was a critical tool for demonstrating that GRP plays a direct role in the early pathogenesis of this disease. Potential mechanisms by which GRP contributes to injury are analyzed, with the main focus on innate immunity. Autoreactive T cells may contribute to lung injury late in the course of disease. A working model is proposed with GRP triggering multiple cell types in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, promoting cascades culminating in chronic lung disease. These observations represent a paradigm shift in the understanding of the early pathogenesis of BPD, and suggest that GRP blockade could be a novel treatment to prevent this lung disease in premature infants.",M1
19067285,"Inhaled nitric oxide for preterm premature rupture of membranes, oligohydramnios, and pulmonary hypoplasia.We sought to determine if inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) administered to preterm infants with premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), oligohydramnios, and pulmonary hypoplasia improved oxygenation, survival, or other clinical outcomes. Data were analyzed from infants with suspected pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and PPROM enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Development Neonatal Research Network Preemie Inhaled Nitric Oxide (PiNO) trial, where patients were randomized to receive placebo (oxygen) or iNO at 5 to 10 ppm. Outcome variables assessed were PaO (2) response, mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Twelve of 449 infants in the PiNO trial met criteria. Six infants received iNO and six received placebo. The iNO group had a mean increase in PaO (2) of 39 +/- 50 mm Hg versus a mean decrease of 11 +/- 15 mm Hg in the control group. Mortality was 33% versus 67%, BPD (2/5) 40% versus (2/2) 100%, and severe IVH or PVL (1/5) 20% versus (1/2) 50% in the iNO and control groups, respectively. None of these changes were statistically significant. Review of a limited number of cases from a large multicenter trial suggests that iNO use in the setting of PPROM, oligohydramnios, and suspected pulmonary hypoplasia improves oxygenation and may decrease the rate of BPD and death without increasing severe IVH or PVL. However, the small sample size precludes definitive conclusions. Further studies are required to determine if iNO is of benefit in this specific patient population.",M1
19066187,"Tumour necrosis factor (--308A) polymorphism in very preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Excessive release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) in very preterm infants. It has been proposed that the risk of developing BPD may be associated with host genetic factors that regulate TNF production. The most commonly studied variant is the guanine to adenine transition at position -308 nucleotides relative to the transcription start site (TNF -308A). However, studies that have examined the association between TNF (-308A) and BPD have reported conflicting findings and have been generally underpowered to exclude plausible genotypic risks. AIM: To systematically review evidence for the association of TNF (-308A) with BPD. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic association studies. RESULTS: Six cohort studies in which a total of 804 preterm infants participated were identified. The studies were generally of fair methodological quality. None of the individual studies or a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the six studies found a significant association of TNF (-308A) genotype with the development of BPD: pooled relative risk 1.03 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TNF (-308A) polymorphism is not strongly associated with the risk of developing BPD in very preterm infants. The 95% confidence interval is consistent with an association no stronger than a relative increase in risk of 25%. Future research efforts to define genetic predisposition to BPD should focus on alternative candidate genes.",M1
19052476,"Hypoxic stress exacerbates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a neonatal mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.BACKGROUND: Premature infants with lung injury often experience intermittent episodes of hypoxemia. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether intermittent hypoxemia exacerbates oxidative stress and lung injury in neonatal mice in a hyperoxia-induced model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS: For the BPD model, 3-day-old C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (65% O(2)) for 4 weeks (O(2) group) or to hyperoxia and intermittent (10 min daily) hypoxia (O(2) + H group). Upon completion of O(2) or O(2) + H exposure, the degree of pulmonary alveolarization and granulocytic infiltration were examined. The severity of oxidative injury in lungs was defined by tissue glutathione and protein carbonyl content. Data were compared to those in naïve mice and mice subjected only to intermittent hypoxia. RESULTS: Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited a dramatic (p &lt; 0.0001) decrease of alveolarization, significantly increased granulocytic infiltration (p &lt; 0.0001) and increased protein carbonyl content (p = 0.04) compared to naïve mice. However, O(2) + H mice demonstrated significantly (p = 0.03) fewer alveoli compared to their O(2) counterparts. This was associated with a significantly (p = 0.02) decreased pulmonary total/oxidized glutathione ratio and a significant (p = 0.03) elevation of protein carbonyl content. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, intermittent hypoxic stress during hyperoxic induction of BPD in mice potentiates oxidative stress in lung tissue and exacerbates alveolar developmental arrest.",M1

OBJECTIVE: Determine peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) among infants with BPD before, during and after feeding. METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of BPD were prospectively studied between July-September, 2005. SpO2 was measured with a manual digital pulsioxymeter 5 times during feeding. Alpha levels were set at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: 67 events were studied in 18 patients. For each participant, oxygen saturation was measured five times yielding a total of 335 recordings. Frequent desaturation episodes were recorded during feeding, (SpO2&lt;88%) in 16 of the 18 cases. SpO2 reached 80% for some recordings among 67% of participants (n=12), with p&lt;0.001. CONCLUSION: Among BDP patients, SpO2 decreases during feeding, reaching severe desaturations (SpO2&lt;80%) among in two thirds of the cases. Oxygen concentration must be sufficiently increased during feeding in order to rise the level of SpO2 to a minimum of 88%.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: The prospectively collected cohort included 163 infants. All infants were born between 1998-2002 in a single regional hospital before 32 weeks of gestation and survived the first hospitalization. Altogether, 107 cord blood proteins were analyzed. Twenty-two antenatal clinical factors were included in the data mining and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The incidence of RDS was 64% and of BPD was 25%. Histologic chorioamnionitis protected from RDS (odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.53; P &lt; .001). Besides the length of gestation, other clinical factors poorly predicted the outcomes. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 independently predicted RDS (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 3.0-23.1; P &lt; .001). Soluble glycoprotein 130 independently predicted BPD (OR, 6.07; 95%CI, 2.20-16.7; P &lt; .001).

18991341,"Airway dimensions in bronchopulmonary dysplasia: implications for airflow obstruction.The cause of lung function abnormalities in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is incompletely understood, even in the  new era  of this disease. Altered airway wall dimensions are important in the pathogenesis of airflow obstruction in diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether airway wall dimensions contribute to lung function abnormalities in BPD is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate airway wall dimensions in relation to airway size in BPD. Lung tissue of patients with BPD was obtained at autopsy, and lung tissue from children who died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) served as control. Airway wall dimensions and epithelial loss were measured in 75 airways from 5 BPD patients and 176 airways from 11 SIDS patients. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the relationships between airway wall dimensions and airway size for BPD and SIDS patients. Little epithelial loss was present in the BPD patients while extensive loss was observed in some of the SIDS patients. The inner wall area, outer wall area, epithelium area and smooth muscle area were all substantially larger (all P &lt; 0.001) in BPD than in SIDS patients. It is likely that the increased thickness of the airway wall components contributes to airflow obstruction in BPD patients.",M1
18990549,"[Methodological aspects of economic evaluation in pediatrics: illustration by RSV infection prophylaxis in the French setting]The methodological approach of the economic evaluation of drugs in pediatrics is illustrated by the case study of the prophylaxis for RSV infections using palivizumab in the French setting. The indications for the reimbursement of this treatment have been restricted to premature children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) or hemodynamically significant congenital-heart disease. A model was developed primarily using the results of the pivotal clinical studies on palivizumab. Unit costs were estimated (2006 values) in both societal and payer's perspectives. An assumption was made and discussed on the benefits of the prophylaxis on mortality. Based on the different data available and the estimated costs and benefits, different cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) were estimated from both the society's and payer's points of view. A discount rate of 3% was applied to benefit. The CER obtained in the most unfavorable case is considered acceptable for the innovative-medical technologies in the French-healthcare system. Some of the parameters used by the model will be illustrated from the EPIPAGE study data from 2 of the 9 regions involved in this study: this evaluation suggests that the children not having an RSV infection during their 1st year of life will continue to require significantly fewer hospitalizations in the following years. These additional evaluations also suggest that the model overestimates the costs of the treatment with regard to the true medical situation. This could be explained by the model not using the children's exact weight or the real number of injections because the children had been discharged from the maternity ward based on their date of birth and the epidemic period. In spite of these factors, RSV prophylaxis using palivizumab in premature children with BPD or hemodynamically significant congenital-heart disease can be considered cost-effective in France.",M1
18947494,"[Lipopolysaccharide and hyperoxia induce nuclear factor-kappa B expression in human embryo lung fibroblasts in vitro]OBJECTIVE: The development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is attributed to intrauterine inflammatory and postnatal mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hyperoxia exposure on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression in human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELFs) in vitro. METHODS: Either LPS (100 ng/mL) or hyperoxia (60%), or a combination of both was employed to stimulate confluent HELFs. After 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hrs of stimulation, the nuclear translocation of two subunits p50 and p65 in HELFs was detected with immunocytochemistry. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p50 and p65. RESULTS: LPS or hyperoxia stimulation induced the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 at 30 minutes of exposure. mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 peaked at 1 hr and then gradually decreased. A stimulation of LPS combined with hyperoxia induced the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. NF-kappaB p50 and p65 mRNA expression peaked at 2 hrs of stimulation and then decreased slowly, but was significantly higher than that in the LPS or hyperoxia stimulation alone group 4 hrs after stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Both LPS and hyperoxia exposure induced NF-kappaB activation in the HELFs in vitro. Hyperoxia combined with LPS induced a more prolonged duration of NF-kappaB activation. This suggests that the individuals who were subjected to intrauterine inflammation and postnatal hyperoxia exposure are more vulnerable to lung injury.",M1
18845493,"Prenatal inflammation and lung development.Prenatal exposure of very low birth weight infants to chronic indolent chorioamnionitis with organisms such as mycoplasma and ureaplasma is frequent. Chorioamnionitis is inconsistently associated with changed risks of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), probably because the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis does not quantify the extent or duration of the fetal exposures to infection and inflammation. The correlations between prenatal exposures and postnatal lung disease also are confounded by the imprecision of the diagnoses of RDS and BPD. In animal models, chorioamnionitis caused by pro-inflammatory mediators or live ureaplasma induces lung maturation, but also causes alveolar simplification and vascular injury. Intra-amniotic endotoxin administration also modulates the fetal innate immune system, resulting in maturation of monocytes to alveolar macrophages and the induction or paralysis of inflammatory responses depending on exposure history. Prenatal inflammation can have profound effects on the fetal lung and subsequent immune responses.",M1
18800264,"Weight loss and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight infants.Our objective was to evaluate the extent of weight loss in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants and to discover how weight loss and other variables correlate with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). We conducted an observational study of 387 VLBW preterms, gestational age (GA) &lt; 33 weeks, in a single institution over a period of 5 years. The mean weight loss of AGA infants was significantly greater than that of SGA infants. In AGA infants, GA, z-score, weight loss, and male sex were found to correlate with BPD. After adjustments were made for GA and birth weight, each 10% loss of body weight increased the risk for developing BPD by a factor of 2.7. We concluded that excessive weight loss does not prevent BPD in VLBW preterms and presumably should be prevented. Controlled fluid restriction resulting in milder weight loss is probably the right choice.",M1
18784838,"Matrix metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: identification of MMP16 as a new player in lung development.BACKGROUND: Alveolarization requires coordinated extracellular matrix remodeling, a process in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role. We postulated that polymorphisms in MMP genes might affect MMP function in preterm lungs and thus influence the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two hundred and eighty-four consecutive neonates with a gestational age of &lt;28 weeks were included in this prospective study. Forty-five neonates developed BPD. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sought in the MMP2, MMP14 and MMP16 genes. After adjustment for birth weight and ethnic origin, the TT genotype of MMP16 C/T (rs2664352) and the GG genotype of MMP16 A/G (rs2664349) were found to protect from BPD. These genotypes were also associated with a smaller active fraction of MMP2 and with a 3-fold-lower MMP16 protein level in tracheal aspirates collected within 3 days after birth. Further evaluation of MMP16 expression during the course of normal human and rat lung development showed relatively low expression during the canalicular and saccular stages and a clear increase in both mRNA and protein levels during the alveolar stage. In two newborn rat models of arrested alveolarization the lung MMP16 mRNA level was less than 50% of normal. CONCLUSIONS: MMP16 may be involved in the development of lung alveoli. MMP16 polymorphisms appear to influence not only the pulmonary expression and function of MMP16 but also the risk of BPD in premature infants.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To determine if there were preventative therapies proven safe and efficacious in appropriately powered randomised trials. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken. RESULTS: Systemically administered corticosteroids, if given in the first 2 weeks, do significantly reduce BPD but have serious side effects. Vitamin A also reduces BPD, but has side effects, and further investigation is needed to identify the safest dosage regimen. There are, however, promising therapies that include antioxidants, low-dose nitric oxide and methylxanthines.

STUDY DESIGN: Eleven cytokines from 128 very low gestational age infants were analyzed from cord blood and from plasma at ages 1 day and 7 days after birth. The diagnosis of CA was based on histology of the placenta, fetal membranes, and umbilical cord. Neonatal risk factors were recorded. RESULTS: In the 48 infants born with CA, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in cord blood decreased during the first postnatal day. Inflammatory cytokines in cord blood was associated with the severity of CA. At 1 day after birth, the concentration of interleukin (IL)-8 predicted the risk of BPD. For the 75 infants born without CA, cytokine concentrations increased after birth. For the 128 infants born with or without CA, at 1 day after birth, the concentrations of IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 were associated with the risk of BPD, after adjustment for the duration of gestation and severity of respiratory distress during the first day. CONCLUSIONS: In infants exposed to CA, insufficient inhibition of high fetal inflammatory cytokine response shortly after birth may increase the risk of BPD.",M1
18756046,"Decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in bronchoalveolar lavage cells of preterm infants with maternal chorioamnionitis.Maternal chorioamnionitis has been associated with abnormal lung development. We examined the effect of maternal chorioamnionitis on the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the lungs of preterm infants. A total of 63 preterm (&lt;or=34 weeks) infants who were intubated in the delivery room were prospectively enrolled. Their placentas were examined for the presence of chorioamnionitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cells were obtained shortly after birth. TGF-beta1 was measured in BAL fluid and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in BAL cells. TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in BAL cells showed a positive correlation with gestational age (r=0.414, p=0.002). TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the presence of maternal chorioamnionitis (0.70+/-0.12 vs. 0.81+/-0.15, p=0.007). Adjustment for gestational age, birth weight, and delivery mode did not nullify the significance. TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was marginally significantly decreased in preterm infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) later (0.75+/-0.11 vs. 0.82+/-0.15, p=0.055). However, adjustment for gestational age, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and maternal chorioamnionitis nullified the significance. These results might be an indirect evidence that maternal chorioamnionitis may inhibit normal lung development of fetus.",M1
18679037,"Nonventilatory strategies for prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia--what is the evidence?This review briefly summarizes the evidence for a number of mainly drug-related strategies to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). Oxygen supplementation is frequently used in neonatal units and oxygen toxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. However, current evidence for an optimal oxygen saturation for extremely premature infants is scarce. This gap in knowledge will hopefully be closed by a number of ongoing or prospective trials addressing this issue. The role of inhalational nitric oxide in the prevention of BPD is still unclear despite existing data from a number of large randomized trials. Early administration of caffeine seems to confer a benefit with regard to BPD. Prophylactic or early application of surfactant may also be beneficial. High intramuscular doses of vitamin A slightly reduce the incidence of the disease. There is currently no evidence supporting other nutritional interventions to prevent BPD. Anti-inflammatory drugs, like alpha(1)-proteinase inhibitor, pentoxifylline and azithromycin, and antioxidants, like N-acetylcysteine and superoxide dismutase, have not been proven effective yet. Diuretics can ameliorate lung function, but there is no evidence supporting their long-term use. Ureaplasma urealyticum colonization of airways is associated with an increased risk of BPD. However, there is no proof for an effect of erythromycin on BPD. The potential roles for therapies like bombesin-like peptide-blocking antibodies or Clara cell 10-kDa protein have yet to be defined.",M1
18676410,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and inflammatory biomarkers in the premature neonate.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is the most common, serious sequela of premature birth. Inflammation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of BPD. Often initiated by a pulmonary fetal inflammatory response, lung inflammation is exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and exposure to supplemental oxygen. In response to these initiators of injury, a complex interaction occurs between proteins that attract inflammatory cells (ie, chemokines), proteins that facilitate the transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells from blood vessels (ie, adhesion molecules), proteins that promote tissue damage (ie, pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases), and proteins that modulate the process (eg, anti-inflammatory cytokines, binding proteins and receptor antagonists). In addition, during recovery from inflammatory injury, growth factors and other substances that control normal lung growth and mediate repair influence subsequent lung structure. In this review, we discuss the role of each aspect of the inflammatory process in the development of BPD. This discussion will include data from measurements of biomarkers in samples of fluid aspirated from the airways of human infants relevant to each phase of inflammation. Despite their limitations, these measurements provide some insight into the role of inflammation in the development of BPD and may be useful in identifying infants at risk for the disease.",M1
18669147,"Neonatal outcome of inborn and outborn extremely low birth weight infants: relevance of perinatal factors.BACKGROUND: A substantial number of premature deliveries occur in hospitals lacking neonatal intensive care facilities. We previously demonstrated a comparable outcome of very low birth weight infants delivered in a level II nursery to that of inborn infants delivered in our tertiary care center, but a similar comparison of extremely low birth weight infants has not been done. OBJECTIVES: To compare the neonatal outcome (mortality, severe intraventricular hemorrhage/periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and intact survival) of inborn and outborn ELBW infants, accounting for sociodemographic, obstetric and perinatal variables. METHODS: We compared 97 ELBW infants (birth weight &lt; or = 1000 g) delivered between the years 2000 and 2004 in a hospital providing neonatal intensive care to 53 ELBW babies delivered in a referring hospital. A univariate model was first applied to examine the associations of the individual independent variables with the outcome variable, followed by a logistic stepwise regression analysis for each of the outcome variables. The odds ratios for each predictor were reported as well as their P values and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the stepwise logistic regression analysis, accounting for a possible confounding effect of the independent variables, 'hospital of birth' remained a statistically significant predictor in the final step only for mortality, with odds ratio (inborns relative to outborns) of 3.32 (95% CI 1.19-9.28, P = 0.022). No statistically significant associations with the other outcome variables were found (severe IVH/PVL odds ratio = 1.99, 95% CI = 0.77-5.14, P = 0.155; <e>BPD</e> odds ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.19-1.91, P= 0.384; intact survival OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.23-1.35, P = 0.195). CONCLUSIONS: ELBW outborn infants may share an outcome comparable with that of inborn babies, if adequate perinatal care is provided.",M1
18647275,"Does nasal CPAP reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>)?Early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or early surfactant therapy with early extubation onto nCPAP rather than continued mechanical ventilation has been adopted by many centres, particularly in Scandinavia, as part of the treatment of newborns with respiratory distress syndrome. It has been suggested that bronchopulmonary dysplasia is less of a problem in centres adopting such a policy. Results from randomized trials suggest prophylactic or early nCPAP may reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but further studies are required to determine the relative contributions of an early lung recruitment policy, early surfactant administration and nCPAP in reducing BPD. In addition, the optimum method of generating and delivering CPAP needs to be determined. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of nCPAP in improving long-term respiratory outcomes needs to be compared with the newer ventilator techniques with the optimum and timing of delivery of surfactant administration.",M1
18614962,"Genetic risk factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.The aim of the study was to assess the association between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) and polymorphisms of genes coding for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-[beta]1), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). A sample of 181 newborns with mean gestational age of 28 wk was prospectively evaluated. Molecular analysis of TGF-[beta]1 -800G&gt;A, -509C&gt;T, 10T&gt;C, 25G&gt;C, VEGF -460T&gt;C and 405G&gt;C and MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphisms were performed and the number of CA repeats in the promoter region of IGF-1 gene was assessed. The frequency of all TGF-[beta]1, IGF-1, and MTHFR polymorphisms, as well as the frequency of VEGF 405G&gt;C polymorphism was similar in all groups. The newborns with -460TT and -460CT genotypes were significantly overrepresented in the BPD groups compared with the no BPD group. Multivariate analysis revealed that carrying T allele increased the risk of BPD by 9% (95%CI: 2-14%) above the baseline risk established for given gestational age, length of oxygen therapy, and sex. Based on our data from a single center, we propose that VEGF -460T&gt;C polymorphism may influence the risk of BPD.",M1
18605970,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and early prophylactic inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants: current concepts and future research strategies in animal models.We reviewed the literature on the use of inhaled nitric oxide and the influence of supplemental oxygen on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>), and the role of endogenous nitric oxide-synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, the interplay of nitric oxide and superoxide, protein nitration and the nuclear factor kappa B-pathway. BPD is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity leading to arrested lung development in newborns. Several studies indicate that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves pulmonary angiogenesis, lung alveolarization, distal lung growth and pulmonary function in preterm infants. Given the inconclusive results of clinical studies, however, it is unclear which subpopulations of infants might benefit. Moreover, data on iNO are conflicting whether exogenous nitric oxide is protective or damaging in the presence of hyperoxia. The toxicology of iNO is poorly understood and its potential interaction with oxygen has to be considered given that infants treated with iNO are also supplemented with oxygen. The underlying mechanisms of the effects of iNO in the newborn lung need further analysis. New data clarifying the role of endogenous nitric oxide-synthases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the interplay of nitric oxide and superoxide, and protein nitration with concurrent iNO-therapy might answer some of these questions.",M1

METHODS: Gender, race, birth weight, gestational age, histology of the placenta, diagnosis of BPD at 36 weeks' gestation, postnatal dexamethasone treatment, and death were recorded in 150 preterm infants born at &lt;28 weeks' gestation, and admitted between 1996 and 2001. RESULTS: In 122 AGA infants (mean gestational age: 26.18 weeks, mean birth weight: 837 g), BPD was associated with gestational age-related birth weights below the 50(th) centile. Intrauterine growth deceleration started between 25 and 26 weeks' gestation. Chorioamnionitis was not related to BPD. CONCLUSIONS: AGA infants of 26-28 weeks' gestation with birth weights below the median showed an increased risk of developing BPD.",M1
18563166,"Association of <e>BPD</e> and IVH with early neutrophil and white counts in VLBW neonates with gestational age &lt;32 weeks.OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between early low neutrophil count from routine blood samples, white blood count (WBC), pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes for very low birth weight infants (VLBW &lt;or=1500 g) with gestational age &lt;32 weeks. STUDY DESIGN: Information was abstracted on all infants admitted to level III neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin 2003 to 2004. A total of 1002 VLBW neonates (78%) had differential and corrected total white counts within 2 (1/2) h of birth. Data analyses included frequency tables, binary logistic, ordinal logistic and ordinary regression. RESULT: Low neutrophil count (&lt;1000 per microl) was strongly associated with low WBC, pregnancy complications and antenatal steroids. Low neutrophil count predicted bronchopulmonary dysplasia severity level (odds ratio, OR: 1.7, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.1 to 2.7) and intraventricular hemorrhage grade (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.8). CONCLUSION: Early neutrophil counts may have multiple causes interfering with their routine use as an inflammatory marker. Nonetheless, low neutrophil count has consistent independent associations with outcomes.",M1
18562451,"Respiratory health in pre-school and school age children following extremely preterm birth.RATIONALE: Increasing survival at extremely low gestational ages is associated with very high rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) but is rarely quantified. OBJECTIVES: To identify respiratory morbidity and risk factors in the EPICure cohort over the first 6 years of life. METHODS: 308 babies born at &lt; or =25 weeks' gestation in 1995 were followed up at 30 months and 6 years of age. Respiratory outcome was evaluated using clinical assessment, parental questionnaire and peak expiratory flow (PEF) at 6 years. RESULTS: 74% of this population received supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age and 36% were discharged with supplemental oxygen which continued for a median of 2.5 months (75th percentile: 8.5 months). 236 children were followed to 6 years. Respiratory symptoms and medication use were more prevalent at 30 months and 6 years in children with BPD compared to those without. Children without BPD (n = 56) were not significantly different from their classmates but had consistently higher prevalence of poor respiratory health. Symptoms, need for hospital admission and medication use declined between 30 months and 6 years. 200 index children completed three PEF measures; PEF was lower than in classmates (mean adjusted difference: 39 l/min (95% CI 30 to 47)) and was lowest in children discharged home with oxygen and in those with BPD. Gestational age, BPD and maternal smoking at home and in pregnancy were independent risk factors for symptoms, but BPD was the only independent associate of PEF. CONCLUSION: Extremely preterm children have a continuum of poor respiratory health over the first 6 years, which is exacerbated by smoking during pregnancy and in the home.",M1
18446177,"Lung protective ventilatory strategies in very low birth weight infants.Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory diagnosis in preterm infants. Surfactant therapy and mechanical ventilation using conventional or high-frequency ventilation have been the standard of care in the management of RDS. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) continues to remain as a major morbidity in very low birth weight infants despite these treatments. There is no significant difference in pulmonary outcome when an optimal lung volume strategy is used with conventional or high-frequency ventilation. Lung injury is directly related to the duration of invasive ventilation via the endotracheal tube. Studies using noninvasive ventilation, such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, have shown to decrease postextubation failures as well as a trend toward reduced risk of BPD. Lung protective ventilatory strategy may involve noninvasive ventilation as a primary therapy or following surfactant administration in very preterm infants with RDS. Initial steps in the management of preterm infants may also include sustained inflation to establish functional residual capacity, followed by noninvasive ventilation to minimize lung injury and subsequent development of BPD.",M1
18446173,"Antenatal inflammation and lung injury: prenatal origin of neonatal disease.INTRODUCTION: Antenatal inflammation in utero may be associated with lung injury and subsequent aberrant lung development resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>). BPD has become a developmental disease with a uniform arrest in lung development. STUDY DESIGN: The role of antenatal inflammation in the induction of lung injury was explored in a sheep model suitable for the study of lung development with respect to human development. Chorioamnionitis was induced by a single injection of endotoxin into the amniotic cavity under ultrasound guidance. RESULT: Endotoxin-induced chorioamnionitis caused a cascade of lung injury, pulmonary inflammation and remodeling in the fetal lung similar to lung injury previously described in adult animal models. The structural changes in the fetal lung after chorioamnionitis showed little to no fibrosis and alveolar/microvascular simplification similar to new BPD. The identified cytokine networks and regulators may explain the absence of fibrosis and lung simplification after strictly intra-uterine inflammation. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of antenatal inflammation in the fetal lung were multifactorial and could be antenatally modulated. Fetal pulmonary inflammation was temporarily suppressed by maternal glucocorticoid therapy. However, pulmonary inflammation could be augmented postnatally by resuscitation, oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation and pulmonary and systemic infection, which opens a broad window of clinical options.",M1
18556628,"Nasal ventilation alters mesenchymal cell turnover and improves alveolarization in preterm lambs.RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<e>BPD</e>) is a frequent cause of morbidity in preterm infants that is characterized by prolonged need for ventilatory support in an intensive care environment. BPD is characterized histopathologically by persistently thick, cellular distal airspace walls. In normally developing lungs, by comparison, remodeling of the immature parenchymal architecture is characterized by thinning of the future alveolar walls, a process predicated on cell loss through apoptosis. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that minimizing lung injury, using high-frequency nasal ventilation to provide positive distending pressure with minimal assisted tidal volume displacement, would increase apoptosis and decrease proliferation among mesenchymal cells in the distal airspace walls compared with a conventional mode of support (intermittent mandatory ventilation). Methods: Accordingly, we compared two groups of preterm lambs: one group managed by high-frequency nasal ventilation and a second group managed by intermittent mandatory ventilation. Each group was maintained for 3 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oxygenation and ventilation targets were sustained with lower airway pressures and less supplemental oxygen in the high-frequency nasal ventilation group, in which alveolarization progressed. Thinning of the distal airspace walls was accompanied by more apoptosis, and less proliferation, among mesenchymal cells of the high-frequency nasal ventilation group, based on morphometric, protein abundance, and mRNA expression indices of apoptosis and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that high-frequency nasal ventilation preserves the balance between mesenchymal cell apoptosis and proliferation in the distal airspace walls, such that alveolarization progresses.",M1
18552709,"Ventilation of the very immature lung in utero induces injury and <e>BPD</e>-like changes in lung structure in fetal sheep.Preterm infants are at high risk of developing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To investigate causes of VILI, we have developed an animal model of in utero ventilation (IUV). Our aim was to characterize the effects of IUV on the very immature lung, in the absence of nonventilatory factors that could contribute to lung pathology. Fetal sheep were ventilated in utero at 110 d gestation for 1, 6, or 12 h (two groups; n = 5 each). Lung tissue was collected at 12 h after initiating IUV in the 1, 6, and one 12 h IUV groups. Lung liquid was replaced in the second 12 h IUV group and tissues collected at 117 d. Operated, nonventilated 110 and 117 d fetuses were controls. IUV reduced secondary septal crest densities, simplified distal airsacs, caused abnormal collagen and elastin deposition, and stimulated myofibroblast differentiation and cellular proliferation. IUV causes VILI in very immature lungs in the absence of other complicating factors and reproduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia -like changes in lung morphology. IUV offers a novel method for dissociating VILI from other iatrogenic factors that could contribute to altered lung development caused by VILI.",M1
20531117,"Schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder: similarities and differences in the experience of auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and childhood trauma.This study investigated similarities and differences in the experience of auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and childhood trauma in schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Patients with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia or BPD were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV. Axes 1 and 2 and auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and childhood trauma were assessed. A total of 111 patients participated; 59 met criteria for schizophrenia, 33 for BPD, and 19 for both. The groups were similar in their experiences of voices, including the perceived location of them, but they differed in frequency of paranoid delusions. Those with a diagnosis of BPD, including those with schizophrenia comorbidity, reported more childhood trauma, especially emotional abuse. BPD and schizophrenia frequently coexist, and this comorbidity has implications for diagnostic classification and treatment. Levels of reported childhood trauma are especially high in those with a BPD diagnosis, whether they have schizophrenia or not, and this requires assessment and appropriate management.",M2
20491428,"[Psychopharmacotherapy improves psychosocial functioning in adolescents with borderline personality disorder]Treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) has undergone significant changes within the last decades. Although there is no specific pharmacological treatment approach for BPD per se, there is evidence for a beneficial effect of psychopharmacological treatment in adults. As there is a significant lack of data regarding such treatment in adolescents we aim to investigate the effects of psychopharmacological treatment retrospectively focusing on the first period of treatment. The study sample comprised 2,778 subjects (inpatients and outpatients) from a population on demand of psychiatric services referred to our department, with 39 patients (aged 16,2 +/- 1,7 yrs.) having a diagnosis of BPD. Psychosocial functioning as indexed on axis VI was assessed within the BADO documentation algorithm before and after treatment. Effects of treatment in terms of improved psychosocial functioning under different medications as well as different risk variables were assessed. Moreover, medicated and un-medicated patients were compared as regards effects of treatment. Upon admission inpatients showed a significantly higher impairment in their psychosocial functioning compared with outpatients. There was no significant difference between medicated and un-medicated patients with respect to the different risk variables assessed. Psychosocial functioning improved under pharmacological treatment, with this effect being unrelated to in- or outpatient status. About 80% of the prescribed medications were antidepressants and neuroleptics, with a combination of two drugs being the most frequent treatment approach to be observed. The data of the present study indicate that psychopharmacological treatment of adolescents with BPD can improve psychosocial functioning.",M2
20458679,"[A psychodynamic approach to self-harm in patients with a borderline personality disorder]BACKGROUND: Self-harm means deliberate tissue damage inflicted without suicidal intent. It occurs very frequently in patients with personality disorders, particularly in patients with a borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Earlier psychodynamic theories were concerned with the symbolic meaning of this type of behaviour, e.g. self-inflicted punishment. More recent theories, however, focus on the role of self-harm in basic psychic functioning, such as affect regulation. AIM: To demonstrate a more recent psychodynamic approach to the concept of self-harm and to outline the clinical implementation of this approach. METHOD: The literature on self-harm was reviewed systematically, particular attention being paid to more recent psychodynamic models. RESULTS: Three dimensions of the psychic change are implemented in hospital-based treatment. Instead of the focus being on the symptoms, it is now on a broader psychotherapeutic process which aims at achieving a structural change in personality. The relation between the basic layer of this process and the therapeutic effect on self-harm in BPD is discussed. CONCLUSION: The described approach to self-harm plays an important role in the psychodynamic treatment of patients with BPD. Current psychodynamic models of the treatment of BPD provide a theoretical background which can be implemented in the actual clinical treatment.",M2
20458204,"Self-reported emotional dysregulation but no impairment of emotional intelligence in borderline personality disorder: an explorative study.Emotional dysfunction is a key feature of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) but emotional intelligence (EI) has rarely been investigated in this sample. This study aimed at an investigation of ability EI, general intelligence, and self-reported emotion regulation in BPD. We included 19 patients with BPD and 20 healthy control subjects in the study. EI was assessed by means of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso emotional intelligence test and the test of emotional intelligence. For the assessment of general intelligence, we administered the multidimensional  Leistungsprüfsystem-Kurzversion.  The emotion regulation questionnaire and the difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were used to assess emotion regulation. The patients with BPD did not exhibit impairments of ability EI and general intelligence but reported severe impairments in emotion regulation. Ability EI was related both to general intelligence (patients and controls) and to self-reported emotion regulation (patients). In conclusion, emotional dysfunction in BPD might primarily affect self-perceived behavior rather than abilities. Intense negative emotions in everyday life may trigger dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies in BPD although patients possess sufficient theoretical knowledge about optimal regulation strategies.",M2
20425312,"An attachment perspective on borderline personality disorder: advances in gene-environment considerations.Accumulating evidence points to severe relationship dysfunction as the core epigenetic expression of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). In adulthood, BPD is typified by disorganization within and across interpersonal domains of functioning. When interacting with their infants, mothers with BPD show marked withdrawal and frightening or frightened behavior, leading to disorganized infant-mother attachments. Linked to both infant disorganization and BPD is a maternal state of mind typified by unresolved mourning regarding past loss or trauma. Early risk factors for BPD in adulthood include maternal withdrawal in infancy and separation of 1 month or more from mother in the first 5 years of life. Likely contributing biological factors include genes linked to dopamine, serotonin, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and neuropeptides. The complex gene-environment picture emerging confers risk or protection against BPD pathology in ways consistent with infants varying biological sensitivity to context. This line of research may refine early risk assessment and preventive mental health services.",M2
20417064,"Abnormal prefrontal cortical response during affective processing in borderline personality disorder.Emotion dysregulation is a hallmark feature of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) and is associated with a dysfunction of prefrontal (PFC)-limbic systems. The purpose of the present study was to examine PFC function in BPD during the experience and suppression of sadness. Subjects were females with BPD (N=9) and age-, gender-, and IQ-matched non-psychiatric comparison subjects (N=8). Evoked hemodynamic oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) was examined in PFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy while subjects viewed neutral or sad images and were instructed to either maintain or suppress their emotional reactions. No group differences in behavioral ratings of sadness suppression or mean levels of evoked oxy-Hb were observed. BPD and control subjects, however, recruited homologous regions of lateral PFC during emotional suppression, with right lateral PFC activation for BPD subjects associated with difficulty suppressing sadness, whereas an inverse relationship was observed in left lateral PFC for healthy controls. Exploratory analyses revealed that the slope of the rise in oxy-Hb in medial PFC during transient sadness was positive and steep for healthy controls. Conversely, BPD subjects showed a negative and shallow slope, which was associated with severity of clinical symptoms. These results suggest that BPD subjects may show abnormal evoked oxy-Hb in medial PFC during transient sadness, with recruitment of right lateral PFC in BPD associated with reported difficulty in suppressing emotion. This abnormal cortical response, possibly in tandem with subcortical-limbic regions, may underlie symptoms of emotion dysregulation in BPD.",M2
20399337,"An experimental investigation of emotional reactivity and delayed emotional recovery in borderline personality disorder: the role of shame.Despite the emphasis on emotional reactivity and delayed emotional recovery in prominent theoretical accounts of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), research in this area remains limited. This study sought to extend extant research by examining emotional reactivity (and recovery following emotional arousal) to 2 laboratory stressors (one general, and the other involving negative evaluation) and exploring the impact of these stressors on subjective responding across the specific emotions of anxiety, irritability, hostility, and shame. We hypothesized that outpatients with BPD (compared to outpatients without a personality disorder; non-PD) would demonstrate heightened subjective emotional reactivity to both stressors, as well as a delayed return to baseline levels of emotional arousal. Results provide evidence for context- and emotion-specific reactivity in BPD. Specifically, BPD participants (compared to non-PD participants) evidenced heightened reactivity to the negative evaluation but not the general stressor. Furthermore, results provide support for shame-specific reactivity in BPD, with BPD participants (vs non-PD participants) evidencing a significantly different pattern of change in shame (but not in reported anxiety, irritability, or hostility) across the course of the study. Specifically, not only did BPD participants report higher levels of shame in response to the negative evaluation, their levels of shame remained elevated following this stressor (through the post-recovery period at the end of the study). Findings suggest the importance of continuing to examine emotional reactivity in BPD within specific contexts and across distinct emotions, rather than at the general trait level.",M2
20393271,"Borderline personality disorder features and pain: the mediating role of negative affect in a pain patient sample.OBJECTIVES: There is considerable evidence that personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), tend to co-occur with chronic pain. There is also evidence that mood disorders co-occur with chronic pain conditions. Given the central role of affective instability and negative mood states in BPD, we proposed that affective features of depression, anxiety, and hostility may account for the association between BPD features and the severity of pain reported in a patient sample. METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-seven patient participants completed the Battery for Health Improvement. This included measures of DSM-IV BPD features, affect scales (depression, anxiety, hostility), and pain items assessing the severity of pain and somatic symptoms. RESULTS: As predicted, individuals with higher levels of BPD features reported greater severity of pain and somatic complaints, including higher levels of maximum and minimum pain levels in the past month. In addition as predicted, this association was no longer significant after controlling for affect scales. In particular, depression was strongest in accounting for this association. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that the association between BPD features and pain is accounted for by negative affect, primarily in the form of depression. This is consistent with current theoretical perspectives on BPD. This also suggests that clinicians observing or detecting BPD features among pain patients should consider negative affect, especially depression, in addressing these issues.",M2
20386260,"A randomized controlled trial of a Dutch version of systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving for borderline personality disorder.Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) is a group treatment for persons with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) that is relatively easy to implement. We investigated the efficacy of a Dutch version of this treatment (VERS). Seventy-nine DSM-IV BPD patients were randomly assigned to STEPPS plus an adjunctive individual therapy, or to treatment as usual. Assessments took place before and after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. STEPPS recipients showed a significantly greater reduction in general psychiatric and BPD-specific symptomatology than subjects assigned to treatment as usual; these differences remained significant at follow-up. STEPPS also led to greater improvement in quality of life, especially at follow-up. No differences in impulsive or parasuicidal behavior were observed. Effect sizes for the differences between the treatments were moderate to large. The results suggest that the brief STEPPS program combined with limited individual therapy can improve BPD-treatment in a number of ways.",M2

Participants were recruited from a sample of 30 patients enrolled in a 12-month randomized controlled trial of DDP versus optimized community care (OCC). Outcomes were assessed after an additional 18 months of naturalistic follow-up. DDP participants received an equivalent amount of individual treatment and less group therapy than those receiving OCC, but demonstrated large, sustained treatment effects over a broad range of outcomes and achieved significantly greater improvement in core <e>BPD</e> symptoms, depression, parasuicide, and recreational drug use over the 30-month study.

However, previous clinical and experimental studies investigating impulsivity in BPD rendered mixed results. In this study, impulsivity was assessed by self-report scales and behavioral inhibition tasks to compare different data levels. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Fifteen women with BPD and 15 matched healthy control subjects (HC) completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Eysenck's Impulsivity Questionnaire and the UPPS (Urgency, Lack of Perseverance, Lack of Premeditation and Sensation Seeking) scale, and participated in a Stroop task, an antisaccade task and a stop signal task. RESULTS: Patients with BPD scored significantly higher on self-report measures as compared to HC, but not in behavioral tests. In BPD patients, but not in HC, behavioral inhibition errors were correlated with more intense emotional state. CONCLUSION: We found a discrepancy between self-report and behavioral data. Further studies need to assess additional possible mechanisms underlying increased impulsivity, their relation to emotional instability, and their neurobiological underpinnings.",M2
20299811,"Neuropsychobiological aspects, comorbidity patterns and dimensional models in borderline personality disorder.Borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is a comorbid and disabling condition with high prevalence in psychiatric settings. The pathogenesis of BPD involves complex interactions among genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors, resulting in multiple core symptom domains such as emotional dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, aggression, cognitive dysfunctions and dissociative states. Neurobiological studies show that symptoms and behaviors of BPD are partly associated with alterations in glutamatergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In addition, neuroimaging studies in BPD patients indicate differences in the volume and activity of specific brain regions related to emotion and impulse control, such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Neurobiological alterations are related to cognitive disturbances in patients with BPD and neuropsychological tests have shown abnormalities of memory, attention, language, and executive functions. The aim of the present review is to provide an updated overview of the main neuropsychobiological aspects of BPD and their relation to clinical symptoms, comorbidity patterns and dimensional models.",M2

Recent models and findings refer to alterations of glutamate and total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) in this condition. METHODS: Absolute quantities of tNAA, creatine, glutamate, glutamine, myoinositol and total choline were measured using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the left anterior cingulate cortex and the left cerebellum in 14 unmedicated women with BPD and comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 18 healthy women. Both groups were matched with respect to age, education and premorbid intelligence. RESULTS: In the anterior cingulate, we found significantly higher tNAA and glutamate concentrations and a trend for lower glutamine levels in women with BPD and comorbid ADHD as compared to healthy women. There were no significant group differences in cerebellar metabolite concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamatergic changes in the anterior cingulate may be associated with BPD and comorbid ADHD. Increased anterior cingulate tNAA may indicate disturbed energy metabolism or impaired frontal maturation.",M2
20218798,"Pain sensitivity is reduced in borderline personality disorder, but not in posttraumatic stress disorder and bulimia nervosa.BACKGROUND: Several studies revealed reduced pain sensitivity in patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) under baseline and stress conditions. To establish whether these findings are specific for BPD, we compared pain thresholds in patients with BPD, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bulimia nervosa, and healthy controls. METHODS: The study included 76 female subjects: 16 patients with BPD, 16 patients with PTSD, 20 patients with bulimia nervosa and 24 healthy controls. Heat and cold pain thresholds were assessed under baseline and stress conditions, using a contact thermode. Mental stress was induced by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task. RESULTS: Under baseline conditions, pain thresholds in patients with BPD were significantly higher compared to healthy controls. Patients with PTSD and bulimia nervosa did not show significant differences in pain thresholds compared to healthy controls. Under stress conditions, the difference between BPD patients and healthy controls became even more prominent, whereas the results in the other patient groups remained insignificant.

Most marked impairments are reported for executive functions, autobiographical memory and social cognition processes. These impairments may be considered as neurocognitive correlates of some clinical symptoms of BPD: the dysexecutive impairment, particularly of those processes based on the orbitofrontal cortex, is the correlate of the increased impulsivity; the interference of negative emotions on encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories is the correlate of the frequent dissociative symptoms; difficulties in social cognition processes (for example in emotion recognition) are the correlate of the instable interpersonal relationships. Early cognitive impairments are also detected in children and adolescents with borderline clinical symptoms, suggesting that neurocognitive functioning: (1) might be considered an indirect index of the neurobiological impact of the childhood trauma that usually BPD subjects report; (2) might be a moderator in the development of BPD. Reviewed studies suggest the utility of a neuropsychological evaluation in all those subjects, children, adolescents and adults, that present borderline clinical symptoms.",M2

20178572,"The effectiveness of joint crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder: protocol for an exploratory randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is a common mental disorder associated with raised mortality, morbidity and substantial economic costs. Although complex psychological interventions have been shown to be useful in the treatment of BPD, such treatments are expensive to deliver and therefore have limited availability and questionable cost-effectiveness. Less complex interventions are required for the management of BPD. A joint crisis plan (JCP) is a record containing a service user's treatment preferences for the management of future crises and is created by the service user with the help of their treating mental health team. These plans have been shown to to be an effective way of reducing compulsory treatment in people with psychosis. However, to date they have not been used with individuals with BPD. This exploratory trial will examine whether use of a JCP is an effective and cost-effective intervention for people with BPD for reducing self-harm. METHODS/DESIGN: In this single blind exploratory randomized controlled trial, a total of 120 participants (age &gt;18 years with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV borderline personality disorder) will be recruited from community mental health teams and, after completing a baseline assessment, will be assigned to one of two conditions: (1) a joint crisis plan, or (2) treatment as usual. Those allocated to the JCP condition will take part in a facilitated meeting, the purpose of which will be to agree the contents of the plan. Following the meeting, a typed version of the JCP will be sent to the patient and to any other individuals specified by the participant. All participants will be followed-up at 6 months. The primary outcome measures are: any self-harm event, time to first episode of self-harm and number of self-harm events over the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures are length of time from contemplation to act of self-harm, help-seeking behaviour after self-harm, cost, working alliance, engagement with services and perceived coercion. Other outcome variables are quality of life, social impairment and satisfaction with treatment. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will help to clarify the potential beneficial effects of JCPs for people with BPD and provide information to design a definitive trial.

20155563,"The role of defense mechanisms in borderline and antisocial personalities.We examined whether borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) and antisocial personality disorder (APD) could be differentiated based on defense mechanisms as measured by observer (Defense-Q; MacGregor, Olson, Presniak, &amp; Davidson, 2008) and self-report (Defense Style Questionnaire; Andrews, Singh, &amp; Bond, 1993) measures. We conducted 2 studies whereby nonclinical participants were divided into borderline and antisocial groups based on scores from the Personality Assessment Inventory (Morey, 1991). Multivariate analysis of variance results revealed significant overall group differences in defense use. Univariate analyses further showed group differences on several individual defenses (e.g., acting out, denial, and turning against self). Together, the findings suggest that in BPD, the defenses may emphasize interpersonal dependency and a tendency to direct aggression toward the self; whereas in APD, the defenses may emphasize egocentricity, interpersonal exploitation, and a tendency to direct aggression toward others. Overall, this study demonstrates important differences in defense use between borderline and antisocial personality groups across both observer and self-report measures.",M2
20153144,"Altered emotional information processing in borderline personality disorder: an electrophysiological study.Emotional dysregulation is one of the key symptoms of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). In the present study it is hypothesized that borderline patients display a cortical hyper-responsivity to emotional stimuli compared with a healthy control group. Further, we aimed to examine whether BPD patients were able to suppress stimuli with negative emotional valence as well as healthy control participants could. This is the first study addressing the electrophysiological processing of emotional stimuli in BPD. The electrophysiological response to emotional information was studied among 30 BPD patients and compared with the response in 30 normal controls using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants were shown pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System with neutral, positive, and negative valence. After performing an attentional task, the participants were asked to perform a reappraisal task. The assignment was to consciously suppress emotions that might occur after viewing pictures with an unpleasant content. Borderline patients displayed larger late positive potentials (LPP) to pictures with an unpleasant valence as compared with the control group, indicating an enhanced elaborative processing of unpleasant stimuli. However, they did not differ on the reappraisal task. Borderline patients show an enhanced emotional cortical reactivity to unpleasant stimuli as compared with a control group. This suggests an emotional dysfunctioning in BPD patients. This feature might be an important focus in the treatment of BPD.",M2

20146650,"Association analysis between gene variants of the tyrosine hydroxylase and the serotonin transporter in borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVES: For patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), we previously reported an independent effect of the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) low-activity (Met(158)) allele and an interaction with the low-expression allele of the deletion/insertion (short/long or S/L, resp.) polymorphism in the serotonin transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The purpose of the present study was to extend these findings to the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) Val(81)Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the 5-HTTLPR S/L polymorphism incorporating the recently described functional A/G SNP within the long allele of the 5-HTTLPR (rs25531) as well as the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism within intron 2 of the serotonin transporter gene (STin2). METHODS: In 156 Caucasian BPD patients and 152 healthy controls, we tested for association between BPD and the TH Val(81)Met SNP, the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphism, the STin2, the interaction of the TH Val(81)Met SNP with the tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR/rs25531, the interaction of the TH Val(81)Met SNP with STin2. RESULTS: Between BPD patients and controls, we observed a slight over-representation of the TH Met(81)Met genotype in BPD patients compared to controls, but no statistically significant differences in genotype distribution of the individual markers after adjusting for multiple testing. Logistic regression analysis showed a lack of interaction between the TH Val(81)Met and the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 as well as between the TH Val(81)Met and the STin2 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not suggest independent or interactive effects of the TH Val(81)Met, the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531, or the STin2 polymorphisms in BPD.",M2
20113305,"Hunter DBT project: randomized controlled trial of dialectical behaviour therapy in women with borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVE: Deliberate self-harm (DSH), general hospital admission and psychiatric hospital admission are common in women meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has been reported to be effective in reducing DSH and hospitalization. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial of 73 female subjects meeting criteria for BPD was carried out with intention-to-treat analyses and per-protocol analyses. The intervention was DBT and the control condition was treatment as usual plus waiting list for DBT (TAU+WL), with outcomes measured after 6 months. Primary outcomes were differences in proportions and event rates of: any DSH; general hospital admission for DSH and any psychiatric admission; and mean difference in length of stay for any hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were disability and quality of life measures. RESULTS: Both groups showed a reduction in DSH and hospitalizations, but there were no significant differences in DSH, hospital admissions or length of stay in hospital between groups. Disability (days spent in bed) and quality of life (Physical, Psychological and Environmental domains) were significantly improved for the DBT group. CONCLUSION: DBT produced non-significant reductions in DSH and hospitalization when compared to the TAU+WL control, due in part to the lower than expected rates of hospitalization in the control condition. Nevertheless, DBT showed significant benefits for the secondary outcomes of improved disability and quality of life scores, a clinically useful result that is also in keeping with the theoretical constructs of the benefits of DBT.",M2
20107104,"Supervised disulfiram in relapse prevention in alcohol-dependent patients suffering from comorbid borderline personality disorder--a case series.AIMS: Disulfiram is widely used to prevent alcoholic relapse. However, due to the intended adverse reaction with ethanol, some believe that its use is dangerous for patients with personality disorders or psychiatric comorbidities because of their increased risk of impulsivity or suicidal behaviour. We examined the safety and efficacy in relapse prevention of a series of alcoholics with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). METHODS: Case history study of patients diagnosed with BPD, prescribed disulfiram in a dose of 1.5-2.5 g/week, supervised by a physician in up to three brief contacts per week. RESULTS: Two out of eight patients remained completely abstinent during the supervised disulfiram therapy over a mean period of 9.25 months. Adherence to treatment was 18.44 +/- 21.78 months. The first relapse occurred after 1.38 +/- 1.41 months. The cumulated time of abstinence was 16.88 +/- 20.48 months. The overall tolerability was considered to be high; dizziness and fatigue appeared in all patients at the beginning of the therapy but did not persist. No serious adverse events or ethanol-disulfiram interactions were observed. No suicidal behaviour was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although case observations should be interpreted with caution, supervised disulfiram seems to deserve further investigation in patients with comorbid BPD, for whom it appears to help prevent alcoholic relapse.",M2
20079614,"Reduced interhemispheric structural connectivity between anterior cingulate cortices in borderline personality disorder.Functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region for emotional and cognitive processing, are associated with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). However, the interhemispheric structural connectivity between the left and right ACC and between other prefrontal regions in this condition is unknown. We acquired diffusion-tensor imaging data from 20 healthy women and 19 women with BPD and comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Interhemispheric structural connectivity between both sides of the ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and medial orbitofrontal cortices was assessed by a novel probabilistic diffusion tensor-based fiber tracking method. In the BPD group as compared with healthy controls, we found decreased interhemispheric structural connectivity between both ACCs in fiber tracts that pass through the anterior corpus callosum and connect dorsal areas of the ACCs. Decreased interhemispheric structural connectivity between both ACCs may be a structural correlate of BPD.",M2
20075647,"Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the management of borderline personality disorder: a randomized double-blind trial.INTRODUCTION: The newer atypical antipsychotics seem to be as effective as previous antipsychotics for impulsivity and aggressiveness of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Objective of this assessment was to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine versus haloperidol in BPD. METHOD: Twenty-eight female inpatients, meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for BPD, were randomly entered in one of the 2 matching contemporaneous groups for an 8-week parallel double-blind study. This included the random assignment to olanzapine or haloperidol in a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcome measurements were as follows: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. Baselines were created at the beginning of the trial through patient assessments and final assessments at the end of the experiment. Analysis of effect size, calculation of confidence intervals and power analysis were also prepared. RESULTS: All of the patients from within both groups completed the study. Intragroup analysis at the eighth week interval revealed significant positive response by both olanzapine and haloperidol in comparison with the baseline (P &lt; 0.05); however, the between-group analysis showed no significant difference, among the patients, at the end of the experiment. The analysis of specific Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale subscales in both groups revealed considerable and comparable improvements in anxiety, tension, depressive mood, and hostility. The effect size analyzes illustrated remarkable improvements with both groups. CONCLUSION: There seems to be no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol regarding the management of mental and behavioral symptoms of patients with BPD.",M2
20074609,"Mismatch negativity in treatment-resistant depression and borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunctions, such as attentional impairment, are central features of both treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). The treatment failure of TRD due to its comorbidity with BPD is debated in the literature. The mismatch negativity (MMN) of the event-related potentials provides an objective marker of involuntary stimulus selective processing, which might help shed light on this issue and provide an avenue for investigating a possible endophenotypic marker for TRD. METHOD: We investigated MMN in 22 patients with TRD, 19 with BPD, and 22 with TRD cormorbid with BPD (TRD+BPD), as well as in 32 healthy volunteers, by employing an acoustic frequency deviance paradigm. In addition, we measured the depressive mood using the Plutchik-van Praag (PVP) depression inventory. RESULTS: There was no significant between-group difference for the N1 latencies/amplitudes, both to the standard and deviant stimuli, and no significant between-group difference for MMN latencies. However, MMN amplitudes were higher in the TRD group than those in the other three groups. PVP scores were highest in TRD+BPD, then TRD, BPD patients, and lowest in healthy subjects. The higher MMN was not correlated with PVP score, nor with the duration of life-long depression, which can be considered as a neurophysiological marker for TRD. CONCLUSION: An atypical lack of inhibition on the irrelevant stimuli or increased cortical neuronal activity, especially frontal area, or both, might be responsible for the finding.",M2
20068378,"Initial orienting to emotional faces in female adolescents with borderline personality disorder.BACKGROUND: Previous research has implicated a general hypervigilance for negative emotional words in adults with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) as compared to healthy controls. The purpose of this study was to assess initial orienting to negative and positive emotional faces in female adolescents with BPD. METHOD: Adolescent patients with BPD (n = 30), adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 29) and adolescent healthy comparison subjects (n = 29) were tested with the visual dot probe task to examine attentional orienting to emotional and neutral faces. RESULTS: In contrast to the adolescent healthy comparison subjects, both the adolescent patients with BPD and the adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses showed a stronger orienting to negative emotional stimuli. However, no differences were found between the clinical groups. Data regarding positive stimuli showed that BPD is not associated with a specific orienting to positive faces. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that attentional orienting to negative faces is not specific to adolescent patients with BPD but also affects adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, no distortion in information processing concerning positive cues was observed in adolescent patients with BPD. If these findings were confirmed, further BPD research could no longer assume that BPD is specifically associated with distortions in initial orienting processes.",M2
20047175,"[Psychopharmacotherapy in adolescents with borderline personality disorder in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment]OBJECTIVE: The majority of adult patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) are treated with psychotropic drugs. However, there are no data on psychotropic therapy in adolescents. This study examines the prevalence of BPD in an adolescent population undergoing either inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment and assesses psychotropic prescription patterns in adolescent in- and outpatients with BPD. METHODS: Out of a population of adolescents undergoing psychiatric treatment over a seven-year observation period, 58 adolescent patients with BPD (16.7 +/- 2.5 years) were investigated retrospectively with regard to their first episode of treatment, type of medication, and different risk variables. RESULTS: Out of the investigated population, 37 inpatients and 21 outpatients received treatment. Inpatients were shown to have higher rates of risk variables (approx. 68% with co-morbid disorders and approx. 49% with self-harmful behaviour, significantly (p &lt; .001) more attempted suicides in their patient history) and higher rates of psychotropic treatment (p &lt; .001). Antidepressants (SSRI and NaSSA) were most commonly prescribed, followed by neuroleptics. More than 50% of the medicated patients were treated with multiple psychotropic drugs administered simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy in BPD has a high and increasing therapeutic value, with the prescription of psychotropic drugs being primarily symptom-orientated. Pharmacotherapy of co-morbid disorders should be accorded equal treatment priority. In line with this, psychotropic treatment of BPD in adolescents is increasingly important. Inpatient adolescents are more burdened in terms of psychiatric risk variables, and also receive medication more often.",M2

20034194,"Clinical challenges in the assessment and management of suicidal behaviour in patients with bordeline personality disorder.Self-injurious and suicidal behaviours are highly prevalent in patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) and the risk of completed suicide is high. Borderline patients often present with heterogeneous clinical pictures and widespread comorbidity complicating clinical assessments and management. This calls for increased efforts in systematic evaluation and monitoring of self-harming and suicidal behaviours; these behaviours should be addressed actively as high priority treatment targets. Early drop-out is common for BPD patients in treatment but is possible to counteract by fostering a strong therapeutic relationship through adopting a realistic, but consistent and supportive approach carefully avoiding reinforcement of suicidal behaviours. Suicidal crises should primarily be managed in an outpatient setting giving priority to keeping the patient safe adopting a safety plan procedure, while helping the patient as quickly as possible to return emotionally to a more acceptable level of arousal and mental functioning. Pharmacological treatments should primarily be used for management of comorbid conditions, but may possibly also be helpful when used to reduce specific symptoms such as anger, hostility and impulsivity. There is currently a range of different integrated short-term and long-term psychological treatments in different stages of development and some of them have been shown to be efficacious in reducing suicidal behaviours; notably dialectical behaviour therapy and mentalization-based therapy.",M2
20001175,"Sedative-hypnotic use in patients with borderline personality disorder and axis II comparison subjects.Sleep disturbance is a common, yet poorly understood, phenomenon in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). We examined the use of sedative-hypnotic medication in BPD, as part of a larger naturalistic study. In comparison to other personality disorder (OPD) comparison subjects, a significantly higher percentage of BPD subjects than OPD subjects used both as needed (prn) and standing medications to help them sleep. Specifically, over the course of the study, BPD subjects were approximately 4 times more likely to have used prn (OR = 4.27, 95% CI: 2.22-8.22) and standing sleeping medications (OR = 3.81, 95% CI: 1.88-7.72). When adjusted for differences in depression, anxiety, and age among BPD and OPD subjects, BPD subjects were approximately 3 times more likely to have used prn (adjusted OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.73-6.61) and standing sleeping medications (adjusted OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.33-5.95). These results indicate that sedative-hypnotic use is greater among BPD than OPD subjects. They also confirm clinical observations that subjective sleep disturbance is a significant problem in BPD.",M2
20001174,"The neuropsychology of borderline personality disorder: relationship with clinical dimensions and comparison with other personality disorders.Patients with borderline personality disorder show various neuropsychological dysfunctions. However, the exact pattern of this dysfunction and its severity in comparison with other personality disorders are not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the neuropsychological performance of borderline patients (n = 50) with that of patients with other personality disorders (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) using the Repeatable Brief Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test battery. Borderline patients showed deficient attention, immediate and delayed memory, and relatively spared visuospatial and language functions compared with controls (effect size range: 0.34-0.99). The neuropsychological deficit was less pronounced in patients with other personality disorders compared with controls (effect size range: 0.18-0.66). However, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with borderline and other personality disorders. The neuropsychological deficit significantly correlated with the impulsivity sector score of the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-<e>BPD</e>). These results suggest that borderline patients are impaired in neuropsychological domains sensitive for frontal and temporal lobe functioning, and this deficit is related to impulsivity.",M2
20001173,"Violent behavior in borderline personality.Little is known about the nature and prevalence of interpersonal violence among individuals with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Employing a longitudinal, multi-site sample, this study examined the degree to which BPD constitutes a risk marker for future violent behavior, and describes the characteristics of violent individuals with BPD and the nature of their violence. Findings showed that 73% of BPD subjects engaged in violence during the one-year study period, and frequently exhibited co-morbid antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathic characteristics. Reported violence was mostly characterized by disputes with acquaintances or significant others. Results also suggest that the shared variance among ASPD, psychopathy, and BPD served to diminish the independent predictive effect of BPD on violence. These findings point to violence as a serious and prevalent problem among individuals with BPD, for whom targeted violence reduction strategies that take into account ASPD and psychopathic co-morbidity must be developed.",M2
19996719,"The relationship between self-reported attachment styles, interpersonal dysfunction, and borderline personality disorder.Clinical theories of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) identify attachment insecurity as the basis of its characteristic disturbed interpersonal functioning. The purpose of this study was to compare attachment ratings in rigorously diagnosed BPD, depressed (MDD), and nonborderline comparison groups and their correlations to features of interpersonal disturbance. Subjects self-reported ratings on attachment styles using the relationship questionnaire. BPD subjects reported higher scores on both preoccupied and fearful attachment styles than both MDD and nonborderline comparison groups. A mixed model of preoccupied and fearful attachment was more prevalent in the BPD group and was associated with 3 to 20 times greater risk for diagnosis of BPD. Scores on preoccupied and fearful attachment styles were correlated with features of interpersonal disturbance in BPD. A combination of preoccupied and fearful self-reported attachment styles is more specific to BPD than either style alone or attachment insecurity in general.",M2
19996718,"Emotional reactions to standardized stimuli in women with borderline personality disorder: stronger negative affect, but no differences in reactivity.Emotional dysregulation is hypothesized to be a core feature of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). In this study, we investigated the course of emotions in response to standardized emotion inductions in BPD. A total of 26 female BPD patients, 28 matched healthy control subjects, and 15 female patients with major depressive disorder listened to short stories inducing an angry, joyful, or neutral mood. Before and immediately after each story as well as 3 and 6 minutes later, participants rated their current anger, joy, anxiety, shame, and sadness. All 3 groups showed the same increase and decrease of emotions. However, strong group differences in the general level of all negative emotions occurred. While sadness was stronger both in BPD and major depressive disorder as compared with healthy controls, all other negative emotions were significantly increased in BPD only independent of comorbid depression. Extreme negative affectivity may be a more appropriate description of BPD-related emotional problems than emotional hyperreactivity.",M2
19996717,"Theory of mind in borderline and cluster-C personality disorder.Borderline Personality Disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is associated with interpersonal problems, such as intense, unstable relationships and fears of abandonment. It has been hypothesized that deficits in social cognitive capacities explain these difficulties. One important aspect of social cognition is theory of mind (ToM)-the capacity to infer others' mental state. We tested ToM capacities with Happé's advanced ToM-test in 16 BPD patients, 16 Cluster-C PD patient controls, and 28 nonpatients. Social reasoning (WAIS Picture Arrangement), general intelligence, and current mood were also assessed. With and without controlling for intelligence, social reasoning, and mood, no evidence for deficits in ToM in BPD patients was found. In fact, both Cluster B and Cluster C patient groups tended to show generally superior performance to the nonpatients on the subscales of Happé ToM-test. All tests correlated similarly with intelligence in the 3 groups. These findings do not support the hypothesis that BPD patients have inferior theory of mind capacities.",M2
19946934,"Quetiapine treatment and improved cognitive functioning in borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether executive functioning improved over time in a sample of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) subjects that took part in a quetiapine treatment trial. METHODS: Performance on the following neurocognitive tasks was assessed at enrolment and at the end of the 12 weeks quetiapine treatment: Trail Making Task, Word Fluency Task and Tower of London Task. Forty-one BPD patients were recruited, of whom 32 completed the trial. An intention-to-treat analysis with a mixed linear model was applied. RESULTS: The data show that participants significantly improved on most executive functioning measures. Patients' scores decreased significantly (mean [SD] difference; p-value) on the Trail Making Task Part A (11.7 [2.3]; p &lt; 0.0001), Part B (51.8 [9.2]; p &lt; 0.0001) and 'B minus A' (40.1 [8.2]; p &lt; 0.0001), on a Phonological (15.9 [1.6]; p &lt; 0.0001) and Semantic (9.8 [1.1]; p &lt; 0.0001) Verbal Fluency tasks, and on the Tower of London total correct score (2.5 [0.4]; p &lt; 0.0001), total move score (29.5 [4.5]; p &lt; 0.0001) and total time (172.9 [35.8]; p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have demonstrated that executive functioning in BPD is improved after treatment with quetiapine. Neurocognitive measures of executive functioning should be considered as valuable outcomes in the study of treatment efficacy in BPD.",M2
19934719,"A view from the trenches: a survey of Canadian clinicians' perspectives regarding the treatment of borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop a sense of how borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is treated in the community. The focus was on psychotherapeutic treatments. METHODS: A 13-item online questionnaire was distributed to 291 clinicians in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Participants were asked about treatment provision, their opinion of optimal treatment, and clinician confidence using both fixed and open response questions. RESULTS: The response rate was 43%. Of the respondents, 64% indicated that they provided treatment to patients with BPD, although two thirds of those responses indicated use of ill-defined treatment approaches. In the responses that involved what could be described as well-defined treatment approaches, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was the most frequently mentioned (20%). Most treatments were offered in an individual therapy format (60%); 38% described providing treatment on a long-term basis. Responses concerning optimal treatment for BPD favored DBT (45%), a combined individual-group therapy format (48%), and long-term duration of treatment (42%). Clinician confidence in treating BPD was low and there was a strong desire for further training. CONCLUSION: The community mental health clinicians who were surveyed were aware of the serious nature of BPD and seek to treat the disorder. However, much of the treatment they provide does not conform to what respondents indicated they considered optimal. Clinicians who responded to the survey seemed relatively unaware of empirically supported psychodynamic treatments for BPD. There is a need for improved training and education regarding BPD and for further dissemination of information concerning empirically supported treatments for BPD.",M2

This paper develops an etiological hypothesis by constructing a neural network with constraints from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and behavior. The neural network ascribes roles to the brainstem's periaqueductal gray, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (ACC/vmPFC). Neural network simulations show how these brain structures might interact during BPD behavior. The simulations suggest that long term depression (LTD) in ACC/vmPFC may explain several BPD symptoms. The network makes testable suggestions. The current work is the first-ever neural network simulation of BPD.",M2
19931853,"Metabolic alterations in the amygdala in borderline personality disorder: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.BACKGROUND: Emotional dysfunction in a frontolimbic network has been implicated in the pathophysiology of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). The amygdala is a key region of the limbic system and plays an important role in impulsivity, affect regulation, and emotional information processing and thus is likely related to BPD symptoms. Alterations of the metabolism in the amygdala might be of interest for understanding the pathophysiology of BPD. However, the amygdala is a difficult region from which to acquire magnetic resonance spectra. We implemented a method for proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) at 3.0 T in which we acquire data within only the small amygdala. The purpose of this study was to determine alterations of the metabolism in the amygdala in BPD patients. METHODS: Twenty-one unmedicated BPD patients and 20 age-matched healthy control participants underwent (1)H MRS to determine neurometabolite concentrations in the left amygdala. All participants underwent psychometric assessments. RESULTS: Significantly reduced total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) and total creatine (tCr) concentrations in the left amygdala of patients with BPD were found. BPD patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed lower levels of tCr compared with BPD patients without PTSD and healthy control subjects. No significant correlations between neurochemical concentrations and psychometric measures were found. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased tNAA and tCr might indicate disturbed affect regulation and emotional information processing in the amygdala of BPD patients. These findings are consistent with many functional and structural neuroimaging studies and may help to explain the greater emotional reactivity of BPD patients.",M2
19927237,"[Neuropsychological rehabilitation in patients with borderline personality disorder: a case series]Recent research studies have been confirming the evidence that patients with personality borderline disorder (<e>BPD</e>) suffer significant neuropsychological disorders. Neurocognitive dysfunction of BPD seems to mainly affect the functions characteristic of the prefrontal areas that participate in information processing and management and in the regulation of complex behavioral responses. Neuropsychological disorders not only are seen in the specific tests but are also reflected and could play an important role in the clinical manifestations of borderline disorder, such as emotional dysregulation and impulsive behaviors. Neurocognitive rehabilitation therapy has been used successfully in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, also characterized by the presence of neuropsychological dysfunctions. Thus, it can be expected that rehabilitation of the neurocognitive functions affected in BPD contributes to the patient's functional improvement. The present work describes a series of five patients with BPD who presented important neuropsychological dysfunctions and who were treated successfully with a specific program of neurocognitive rehabilitation. The results observed justify the performance of controlled clinical studies on the efficacy of this technique in the treatment of BPD.",M2
19927229,"[Neuropsychological dysfunctions in personality borderline disorder: detection strategies]INTRODUCTION: Borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is characterized by emotional instability and impulsivity. However, there is evidence that neurocognitive alterations have a relevant role in the clinical features of these patients. The present study investigates cognitive function in BPD in order to search for a specific profile of neuropsychological alterations. METHODS: Based on previous research and cognitive complaints reported by patients, a neuropsychological assessment protocol focused on prefrontal functioning was applied. The applied neuropsychological battery included tests assessing the following cognitive domains: memory (fixation, consolidation and recovery processes) categorical evocation, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention, processing rate, inhibitory control and working memory. The patient sample was recruited from an outpatient BPD unit and was composed by 26 patients (14 women, 12 men) diagnosed of BPD. RESULTS: In comparison to the normative values, BPD patients have a deficit in the execution of most of the neuropsychological tests. This deficit was especially present in the following: recovery processes of the immediate and differed memory, working memory, sustained attention and processing rate, verbal fluency, impulse control, cognitive flexibility, abstraction and planning. CONCLUSIONS: BPD patients could present a pattern of neurocognitive alterations that suggests a specific impairment of the prefrontal areas and requires a more detailed study. The neuropsychological dysfunctions could partially explain the behavioral alterations in BPD patients.",M2
19899850,"The stability of personality traits in individuals with borderline personality disorder.Although stability and pervasive inflexibility are general criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) personality disorders (PDs), borderline PD (<e>BPD</e>) is characterized by instability in several domains, including interpersonal behavior, affect, and identity. The authors hypothesized that such inconsistencies notable in BPD may relate to instability at the level of the basic personality traits that are associated with this disorder. Five types of personality trait stability across 4 assessments over 6 years were compared for BPD patients (N = 130 at first interval) and patients with other PDs (N = 302). Structural stability did not differ across groups. Differential stability tended to be lower for 5-factor model (FFM) traits in the BPD group, with the strongest and most consistent effects observed for Neuroticism and Conscientiousness. Growth curve models suggested that these 2 traits also showed greater mean-level change, with Neuroticism declining faster and Conscientiousness increasing faster, in the BPD group. The BPD group was further characterized by greater individual-level instability for Neuroticism and Conscientiousness in these models. Finally, the BPD group was less stable in terms of the ipsative configuration of FFM facet-level profiles than was the other PD group over time. Results point to the importance of personality trait instability in characterizing BPD.",M2
19894145,"Emotion-induced memory dysfunction in borderline personality disorder.INTRODUCTION: Although emotional dysregulation is a core problem in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), few neuropsychological studies have evaluated the impact of emotion. The present study aimed at the comprehensive investigation of verbal memory functions with and without emotionally relevant interference in BPD. BPD patients were expected to perform as well as healthy subjects in standard memory tasks but to show fewer capacities to control for emotionally negative interference. METHODS: 47 patients with BPD and 70 healthy control subjects participated. An experimental task assessed verbal memory with respect to standard and emotionally relevant and neutral interference learning conditions. Applied standard tests covered working memory, delayed memory, and word fluency. RESULTS: Memory performances of BPD patients were impaired when negatively valenced interference was conducted but normal in all other conditions. These results remained stable after controlling for comorbid major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. DISCUSSION: The present findings suggest no general impairment of verbal memory functions in BPD but control and inhibition of interference by emotionally significant material seem to be disturbed.",M2
19893341,"Attentional bias in later stages of emotional information processing in female adolescents with borderline personality disorder.BACKGROUND: Bias in emotional information processing has been described in patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). This study investigates whether adolescent patients with a diagnosis of BPD demonstrate abnormalities in attentional maintenance in viewing emotional faces. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Thirty female adolescents with a diagnosis of BPD, 29 female adolescents with mixed psychiatric diagnoses, and 30 healthy participants were tested with the visual dot probe task. The task involved showing photographs of actors with faces depicting neutral, negative, and positive expressions for 1,500 ms each. RESULTS: Attentional bias to negative faces was not generally associated with BPD, but patients with BPD did show a strong correlation between current mood and attentional bias to negative faces. Only in adolescents with BPD did attention to negative faces narrow when they were currently in a state of negative mood. Conversely, both control groups avoided negative faces in conjunction with a decline in positive mood. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that borderline pathology is linked to an inability to disengage attention from negative facial expressions during attentional maintenance when in a negative mood. Based on these findings, mood-dependent therapeutic interventions focusing on attentional processes may represent a useful add-on to established therapies in patients with BPD.",M2
19860073,"The abuse of prescription medications: borderline personality patients in psychiatric versus non-psychiatric settings.OBJECTIVE: In this study, the prevalence of prescription substance abuse among those with borderline personality symptomatology was examined in a large cohort of respondents who participated in one of 13 prior research projects. METHOD: The entire cohort (N = 1039) was divided into 3 subsamples: a psychiatric sample (n = 440), a predominantly primary care sample (n = 599), and an internal medicine sample (n = 332; i.e., a well-defined subset of the predominantly primary care sample that consisted of only internal medicine outpatients seen at one location). The borderline personality scale of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ), either the revised (PDQ-R) or fourth (PDQ-4) version, was used to diagnose all participants either with or without borderline personality. One item from the Self-Harm Inventory,  Have you ever intentionally, or on purpose, abused prescription medication?,  was then used in the subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Among the psychiatric, predominantly primary care, and internal medicine subsamples, the prevalence rates of prescription medication abuse in those diagnosed with borderline personality according to the PDQ were 46.9%, 46.2%, and 11.5%, respectively. In all subsamples, those with borderline personality were statistically significantly more likely to abuse prescription medication than those without the disorder. For example, borderline patients in the psychiatric sample were twice as likely to abuse prescription medications, in the predominantly primary care sample 4 times as likely, and in the internal medicine only sample nearly 6 times as likely. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of setting, patients with <e>BPD</e> are at great risk for the abuse of prescription medications.",M2
19854433,"Emotional, cognitive and physiological correlates of abuse-related stress in borderline and antisocial personality disorder.Childhood abuse is an important precursor of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The current study compared the emotional reactivity to abuse-related stress of these patients on a direct and an indirect level. Changes in self-reported affect and schema modes, psychophysiology and reaction time based cognitive associations were assessed following confrontation with an abuse-related film fragment in patients with BPD (n=45), ASPD (n=21), Cluster C personality disorder (n=46) and non-patient controls (n=36). Results indicated a hyperresponsivity of BPD-patients on self-reported negative affect and schema modes, on some psychophysiological indices and on implicit cognitive associations. The ASPD-group was comparable to the BPD group on implicit cognitions but did not show self-reported and physiological hyper-reactivity. These findings suggest that BPD and ASPD-patients are alike in their implicit cognitive abuse-related stress reactivity, but can be differentiated in their self-reported and physiological response patterns.",M2
19840586,"A comparison of life events in suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents and young adults with major depression and borderline personality disorder.This retrospective study assessed the correlations between various types of stressful life events (SLE) and suicidal adolescents and young adults with major depressive disorder (MDD;22), borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>;18), and nonsuicidal adolescents and young adults with MDD (20) and BPD (20). A community control group of 40 participants was also evaluated. The measurements used were Life Events Checklist, Childhood Sexual Abuse Questionnaire, Suicide Risk Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Suicidal participants experienced a greater number of total lifetime negative events compared with nonsuicidal participants, irrespective of diagnosis, including a greater amount of negative life events in the year before the suicide attempt compared with the year before referral in the nonsuicidal group. Participants with MDD reported more lifetime negative events than participants with BPD. Suicidal adolescents did not have more lifetime death-related SLE than nonsuicidal adolescents, but MDD adolescents experienced more lifetime death-related SLE than BPD adolescents. Suicidal BPD participants reported more lifetime sex abuse-related SLE compared with nonsuicidal BPD participants. The complexity of the relationships between SLE and the interplay of both suicidality and underlying psychopathology is discussed with the relevant treatment implications.",M2

Although stress, especially early life stress, seems to be associated with the development of the disorder, there has been far less research on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in BPD, compared to other psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress has been suggested to exert damaging effects on the brain, particularly the hippocampus; therefore, neuroimaging studies yield important insight into the neurobiology of BPD. This article reviews research on the HPA axis and neuroimaging studies in BPD and aims to integrate these findings.",M2
19834989,"Influence of methylphenidate treatment on smoking behavior in adolescent girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity and borderline personality disorders.BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence are prevalent among pediatric populations with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We assessed the impact of methylphenidate (MPH)treatment on the smoking behavior of adolescent girls with ADHD/borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). METHOD: Twelve female adolescent smokers with ADHD/BPD aged 14to 19 years were treated with MPH for an 8-week period. The severity ofADHD was assessed by the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), whereas the smoking behavior was rated by Fagerstorm Test for Nicotine Dependence(FTND). RESULTS: Significant improvement was detected in ADHD symptoms(ADHD-RS, mean [SD], baseline vs end point: 33.1 [6.8] vs 19.9 [6.8],t = 6.875, df = 11, P = 0.0001). A decline, as assessed by FTND (baseline vs end point: 4.1 [2.6] vs 2.0 [1.9], t = 4.056, df = 11, P = 0.0019), was observed in the severity of nicotine dependence. No significant correlation was found between changes in the ADHD-RS and the FTND after MPH treatment (r = 0.09935, P = 0.7587). CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate may attenuate smoking behavior in female adolescent smokers with ADHD/BPD.",M2
19829206,"The role of mindfulness in borderline personality disorder features.This study investigated whether deficits in mindfulness (attention, awareness, and acceptance of the present moment) underlie variability in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) features and related impairments in interpersonal functioning, impulsivity, and emotion regulation. A path analytic approach was used to examine the relationships of trait mindfulness with BPD features, interpersonal effectiveness, impulsive and passive emotion-regulation, and neuroticism in a psychiatric sample of adults (N = 70). As hypothesized, mindfulness was associated inversely with BPD features and core areas of dysfunction, and these associations continued when controlling for neuroticism. Furthermore, mindfulness deficits continued to predict BPD features even when interpersonal effectiveness, passive and impulsive emotion-regulation, and neuroticism were controlled. These findings suggest that mindfulness may be a unique predictor for the expression of BPD pathology. An emphasis on mindfulness may thus be crucial in enhancing the formulation and treatment of BPD.",M2
19825272,"A developmental, mentalization-based approach to the understanding and treatment of borderline personality disorder.The precise nature and etiopathogenesis of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) continues to elude researchers and clinicians. Yet, increasing evidence from various strands of research converges to suggest that affect dysregulation, impulsivity, and unstable relationships constitute the core features of BPD. Over the last two decades, the mentalization-based approach to BPD has attempted to provide a theoretically consistent way of conceptualizing the interrelationship between these core features of BPD, with the aim of providing clinicians with a conceptually sound and empirically supported approach to BPD and its treatment. This paper presents an extended version of this approach to BPD based on recently accumulated data. In particular, we suggest that the core features of BPD reflect impairments in different facets of mentalization, each related to impairments in relatively distinct neural circuits underlying these facets. Hence, we provide a comprehensive account of BPD by showing how its core features are related to each other in theoretically meaningful ways. More specifically, we argue that BPD is primarily associated with a low threshold for the activation of the attachment system and deactivation of controlled mentalization, linked to impairments in the ability to differentiate mental states of self and other, which lead to hypersensitivity and increased susceptibility to contagion by other people's mental states, and poor integration of cognitive and affective aspects of mentalization. The combination of these impairments may explain BPD patients' propensity for vicious interpersonal cycles, and their high levels of affect dysregulation and impulsivity. Finally, the implications of this expanded mentalization-based approach to BPD for mentalization-based treatment and treatment of BPD more generally are discussed.",M2
19825271,"Stability, change, and heritability of borderline personality disorder traits from adolescence to adulthood: a longitudinal twin study.Although personality disorders are best understood in the context of lifetime development, there is a paucity of work examining their longitudinal trajectory. An understanding of the expected course and the genetic and environmental contributions to these disorders is necessary for a detailed understanding of risk processes that lead to their manifestation. The current study examined the longitudinal course and heritability of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) over a period of 10 years starting in adolescence (age 14) and ending in adulthood (age 24). In doing so, we built on existing research by using a large community sample of adolescent female twins, a sensitive dimensional measure of BPD traits, an extended follow-up period, and a longitudinal twin design that allowed us to investigate the heritability of BPD traits at four discrete ages spanning midadolescence to early adulthood. Results indicated that mean-level BPD traits significantly decline from adolescence to adulthood, but rank order stability remained high. BPD traits were moderately heritable at all ages, with a slight trend for increased heritability from age 14 to age 24. A genetically informed latent growth curve model indicated that both the stability and change of BPD traits are highly influenced by genetic factors and modestly by nonshared environmental factors. Our results indicate that as is the case for other personality dimensions, trait BPD declines as individuals mature from adolescence to adulthood, and that this process is influenced in part by the same genetic factors that influence BPD trait stability.",M2
19825269,"Emotional instability, poor emotional awareness, and the development of borderline personality.Emotional instability and poor emotional awareness are cardinal features of the emotional dysregulation associated with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Most models of the development of BPD include child negative emotional reactivity and grossly inadequate caregiving (e.g., abuse, emotional invalidation) as major contributing factors. However, early childhood emotional reactivity and exposure to adverse family situations are associated with a diverse range of long-term outcomes. We examine the known effects of these risk factors on early childhood emotional functioning and their potential links to the emergence of chronic emotional instability and poor emotional awareness. This examination leads us to advocate new research directions. First, we advocate for enriching the developmental assessment of children's emotional functioning to more closely capture clinically relevant aspects. Second, we advocate for conceptualizing children's early family experiences in terms of the proximal emotional environment to which young children may be or become sensitive. Such approaches should contribute to our ability to identify risk for BPD and guide preventive intervention.",M2
19825268,"Extending extant models of the pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder to childhood borderline personality symptoms: the roles of affective dysfunction, disinhibition, and self- and emotion-regulation deficits.Although research has been conducted on the course, consequences, and correlates of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), little is known about its emergence in childhood, and no studies have examined the extent to which theoretical models of the pathogenesis of BPD in adults are applicable to the correlates of borderline personality symptoms in children. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelationships between two BPD-relevant personality traits (affective dysfunction and disinhibition), self- and emotion-regulation deficits, and childhood borderline personality symptoms among 263 children aged 9 to 13. We predicted that affective dysfunction, disinhibition, and their interaction would be associated with childhood borderline personality symptoms, and that self- and emotion-regulation deficits would mediate these relationships. Results provided support for the roles of both affective dysfunction and disinhibition (in the form of sensation seeking) in childhood borderline personality symptoms, as well as their hypothesized interaction. Further, both self- and emotion-regulation deficits partially mediated the relationship between affective dysfunction and childhood borderline personality symptoms. Finally, results provided evidence of different gender-based pathways to childhood borderline personality symptoms, suggesting that models of BPD among adults are more relevant to understanding the factors associated with borderline personality symptoms among girls than boys.",M2
19817874,"Modulatory role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on the effects of serious life events on impulsive aggression in borderline personality disorder.Impulsive aggression belongs to the key features of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). In the development of BPD, serious life events are known to play a major role. Acute and chronic stress has been suggested to inhibit hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis and to mediate neural plasticity in response to adverse social experiences. Recently it has been reported that the frequency of violent suicide attempts is higher in adult suicide attempters reporting severe childhood sexual abuse and carrying the Val(66)Val genotype of the BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism. In this study we analysed modulating effects of BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism on the effects of physical maltreatment, rape and childhood sexual abuse on impulsive aggression. One hundred and fifty-nine BPD patients from Germany and of Caucasian descent were included. Impulsive aggression was assessed by the Buss-Durkee-Hostility Inventory (BDHI). Childhood sexual abuse accounted for 23.6% of the variance of BDHI sum score. Childhood sexual abuse decreased BDHI sum score in BDNF Val/Val carriers but not in Met carriers. In contrast to previous findings this study analysing a specific gene x environment interaction in BPD patients suggests a decreasing effect of childhood sexual abuse on impulsive aggression in BPD patients, particularly in BDNF Val/Val carriers. The interrelations between serious life events, impulsive aggression and the BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism as well as their implication for BPD are far from understood and require further investigations.",M2
19817630,"Construct validity and prevalence rate of borderline personality disorder among Chinese adolescents.The construct of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) among adolescents is a controversial topic. No research has examined the BPD construct among Chinese adolescents because the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders-III rejects BPD as a valid diagnostic category. The present study explored the construct validity and prevalence of BPD among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong. A total of 4,110 high school students completed the McLean Screening Instrument for borderline personality disorder (MSI-BPD) and other measures assessing various BPD traits twice over a one-year period. DSM-IV-TR BPD criteria set as measured by the MSI-BPD demonstrated good internal consistency, concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis of the MSI-BPD revealed four theoretically meaningful factors, namely affect dysregulation, impulsivity, interpersonal disturbances, and self/cognitive disturbances. Prevalence rate of BPD, according to a stringent simulated diagnostic procedure used in this study, was estimated to be 2% among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong. Findings support that BPD is a valid clinical construct among Chinese adolescents. More research on BPD among the Chinese population is warranted.",M2
19817626,"A prospective investigation of borderline personality disorder in abused and neglected children followed up into adulthood.Child abuse has been implicated as a risk factor for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), yet few prospective longitudinal studies exist. The current study examined whether 500 individuals with documented cases of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect were at elevated risk of BPD in adulthood, compared to 396 demographically similar control children. Results indicated that significantly more abused and/or neglected children overall met criteria for BPD as adults, compared to controls, as did physically abused and neglected children. Having a parent with alcohol/drug problems and not being employed full-time, not being a high school graduate, and having a diagnosis of drug abuse, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder were predictors of BPD and mediated the relationship between childhood abuse/neglect and adult BPD. These results call attention to a heightened risk of BPD in physically abused and neglected children and the need to consider multiple pathways to BPD.",M2
19807925,"Implementation of outpatient schema therapy for borderline personality disorder: study design.BACKGROUND: Schema Therapy (ST) is an integrative psychotherapy based upon a cognitive schema model which aims at identifying and changing dysfunctional schemas and modes through cognitive, experiential and behavioral pathways. It is specifically developed for patients with personality disorders. Its effectiveness and efficiency have been demonstrated in a few randomized controlled trials, but ST has not been evaluated in regular mental healthcare settings. This paper describes the study protocol of a multisite randomized 2-group design, aimed at evaluating the implementation of outpatient schema therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) in regular mental healthcare and at determining the added value of therapist telephone availability outside office hours in case of crisis. METHODS/DESIGN: Patient outcome measures will be assessed with a semi-structured interview and self-report measures on BPD, therapeutic alliance, quality of life, costs and general psychopathology at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 36 months. Intention-to-treat analyses will be executed with survival analysis for dichotomous variables, and one-sample t-tests and ANCOVAs for continuous variables with baseline as covariate and condition as between group factor. All tests will be two-tailed with a significance level of 5%.

19807718,"Psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder.OBJECTIVE: Psychotherapy is considered the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Currently, there are four comprehensive psychosocial treatments for BPD. Two of these treatments are considered psychodynamic in nature: mentalization-based treatment and transference-focused psychotherapy. The other two are considered to be cognitive-behavioral in nature: dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy. METHOD: A review of the relevant literature was conducted. RESULTS: Each of these lengthy and complex psychotherapies significantly reduces the severity of borderline psychopathology or at least some aspects of it, particularly physically self-destructive acts. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive, long-term psychotherapy can be a useful form of treatment for those with BPD. However, less intensive and less costly forms of treatment need to be developed.",M2

A group of 135 treatment-seeking women with BPD were assessed using structured clinical interviews. BPD was assessed using the International Personality Disorders Examination, confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-II, and Axis I disorders were assessed with the SCID I. A total of 17.8% of the sample met criteria for a current ED, with 6.7% meeting criteria for Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 5.9% for Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and 5.2% for Binge-Eating Disorder (BED). In this BPD sample, in the last year, current BN was associated with a significantly greater risk of recurrent suicide attempts while current AN was associated with increased risk of recurrent non-suicidal self-injury. BPD with current AN or BED was associated with a greater number of non-ED current Axis I disorders. Further replication of these results is needed. Women with BPD must be assessed for AN and BN as these diagnoses may confer greater risk for suicidal and self-injurious behavior and may have to be prioritized in treatment.",M2
19794362,"Borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder comorbidity in suicidal patients: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.Suicidality is one of the great challenges in contemporary psychiatry. Suicidal patients are often misdiagnosed in clinical practice. It is very important to evaluate possible comorbidity in diagnostic assessment of suicidal patients. The high prevalence of comorbid bipolar (BD) and borderline personality disorders (<e>BPD</e>) presents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge. Although the primary treatment for patients with BPD is psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy is a core component for the treatment of comorbid conditions such as bipolar disorder. Because of heterogeneity of the BPD, pharmacologic treatment has evolved to some particular dimensions of BPD rather than the disorder in its entirety. The dimensions include affective instability, impulsive aggression and identity disturbance. Effective medication management reduces the overall suffering of the patient and enables to make greater use of psychotherapeutic interventions which is very important for BPD patients with BD comorbidity.",M2
19785701,"Relationship quality and stability in couples when one partner suffers from borderline personality disorder.The main goal of the present study was to examine and compare the psychosocial functioning of 35 couples including a woman diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) to that of a nonclinical control sample of 35 couples. The BPD status of women from the clinical group and the prevalence of personality disorder in their partner were ascertained through the SCID-II. Participants completed self-report measures of couple functioning. A majority of couples in which the woman suffered from BPD (68.7%) evidenced frequent episodes of breakups and reconciliations and, over an 18-month period, nearly 30% of these couples dissolved their relationship. Nearly half of the men involved in a romantic relationship with a woman suffering from BPD met criteria for one personality disorder or more. As compared with nonclinical couples, clinical couples showed lower marital satisfaction, higher attachment insecurity, more demand/withdraw communication problems, and higher levels of violence.",M2
19776671,"The lack of negative affects as an indicator for identity disturbance in borderline personality disorder: a preliminary report.BACKGROUND: Patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) suffer from instability of their relationships, their affectivity and their identity. The purpose of the study was to investigate negative affects and identity disturbance in patients with BPD and in patients without personality disorder using questionnaire data and interview data. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Twelve patients with BPD and 12 patients with major depressive disorder without any personality disorder were assessed with the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) and questionnaires (Inventory of Personality Organization, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). They were compared with respect to the frequency of negative affective verbal expressions using computerized content analysis methods. RESULTS: BPD patients showed higher levels of anxiety, depression and identity diffusion in the questionnaires than major depressive disorder patients without personality disorder. However, they did not report more negative affective expressions in the interview. Patients with identity disturbance of both groups showed higher values of negative mood in the questionnaires, but less anger, less anxiety and less affective intensity in the interview. CONCLUSION: The preliminary findings indicate that patients with identity disturbance show high levels of negative affects in questionnaires but only few negative affects in the interview situation. More studies are needed to enhance the understanding of negative affects and identity disturbance in BPD.",M2
19776670,"Relationship of the Borderline Symptom List to DSM-IV borderline personality disorder criteria assessed by semi-structured interview.BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is a debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 6% of the general population and 10-20% of psychiatric patients. The Borderline Symptom List (BSL) is a self-report questionnaire designed to comprehensively assess BPD symptomatology. Sampling and METHODS: The present study examined the convergence of the BSL with DSM-IV BPD assessed by semi-structured interview. To ensure variability in BPD symptoms, participants were recruited from a large college sample if they generated either high or low scores on a BPD symptom screening questionnaire. The final sample included 59 participants who completed the BSL, the BPD questions from the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV), and self-report measures of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Ten participants (17%) met the full BPD criteria and 29 (49%) met 2 or more criteria. Results indicate strong convergence between the BSL and BPD assessed by semi-structured interview, even when controlling for measures of depression and anxiety. The shortened version of the BSL, the BSL-23, also correlated robustly with BPD assessed by semi-structured interview. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the validity of the BSL (and BSL-23) as a self-report measure of BPD symptomatology. Future research should replicate results in other samples, including those drawn from psychiatric populations.",M2
19773710,"Borderline personality disorder: toward integration.Several psychiatric disorders, including borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), are characterized by emotional dysregulation and impulse dyscontrol. More specifically, symptoms in patients with BPD often occur within the context of disruptions in attachment and related distortions in cognitive-affective processing of the self and others. From a neurocircuitry perspective, findings include prefrontal hypoactivity, amygdala hyperreactivity, and alterations in prefrontal-limbic interaction. Molecular pathways relevant to these circuits include the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems, and there is some evidence that pharmacotherapy with agents that act on these systems may be useful. Given the disruptions in attachment and schemas of the self and others in BPD, establishing a therapeutic alliance is crucial while psychotherapy remains the cornerstone of an integrated approach to management.",M2

The present study examines sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity in individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (<e>BPD</e>) before, during, and following a social stressor task. Data were obtained from an analogue sample of participants screening positive for BPD (n=12) and healthy controls (n=28). In general, BPD participants exhibited increased sympathetic activity (indexed by Cardiac Sympathetic Index, CSI; Toichi et al., 1997) and decreased parasympathetic activity (indexed by Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia, RSA) compared to controls. During the stressful task, BPD and control participants exhibited different trajectories of sympathetic activation: estimates of sympathetic activity increased for BPD participants and decreased for controls. Furthermore, BPD participants reported the task (but not baseline or recovery phases) to be more frustrating than controls. Findings are interpreted in the context of Polyvagal theory.",M2
19748540,"Neural correlates of impaired emotional discrimination in borderline personality disorder: an fMRI study.A common approach to study neuronal aspects of emotional reactivity of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is to study the brain response to emotional faces with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 10 BPD patients and 10 matched controls were submitted to an emotional discrimination task in which subjects had to identify an emotional face from a neutral face while fMRI data was acquired. BPD patients made more mistakes than controls in the discrimination task when negative faces were involved. The emotional discrimination task activated brain areas that are known to participate in processing of emotional faces (fusiform gyrus, insula and amygdala) regardless of the psychiatric condition. Additionally, BPD showed higher activation than controls in the middle and inferior temporal cortical areas, brain areas that participate in the processing of face features that carry emotional value. Furthermore, activity at this site correlated with impulsivity score in the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire. Our findings may be related to cognitive impairment that may be characteristic of the disorder.",M2

Preclinical studies show that orbital frontal cortex (OFC) plays a role in regulating impulsive aggression. Prior work has found OFC dysfunction in BPD. METHODS: We employed a task to provoke aggressive behavior, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), which has never previously been used during functional brain imaging. Thirty-eight BPD patients with intermittent explosive disorder (BPD-IED) and 36 age-matched healthy control subjects (HCs) received (18)fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) on two occasions with a provocation and nonprovocation version of the PSAP. Mean relative glucose metabolism was measured throughout the cortex, and difference scores (provoked - nonprovoked) were calculated. A whole brain exploratory analysis for the double difference of BPD-IED - HC for provoked - nonprovoked was also conducted. RESULTS: BPD-IED patients were significantly more aggressive than HCs on the PSAP. BPD-IED patients also increased relative glucose metabolic rate (rGMR) in OFC and amygdala when provoked, while HCs decreased rGMR in these areas. However, HCs increased rGMR in anterior, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions during provocation more than BPD-IED patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients responded aggressively and showed heightened rGMR in emotional brain areas, including amygdala and OFC, in response to provocation but not in more dorsal brain regions associated with cognitive control of aggression. In contrast, HCs increased rGMR in dorsal regions of PFC during aggression provocation, brain regions involved in top-down cognitive control of aggression, and, more broadly, of emotion.",M2
19721849,"Reduced amygdala and hippocampus size in trauma-exposed women with borderline personality disorder and without posttraumatic stress disorder.BACKGROUND: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) display reduced hippocampus size and impaired cognition. However, studies on individuals with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) are rare, and studies on trauma-exposed patients with BPD but without PTSD are lacking. METHODS: Twenty-four trauma-exposed women with BPD (10 with PTSD and 14 without) and 25 healthy controls underwent 3-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging of the amygdala and hippocampus and a clinical and neuropsychological investigation. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with BPD and PTSD displayed significantly reduced amygdala (34%) and hippocampus (12%) size and significantly impaired cognition. Trauma-exposed patients with BPD but without PTSD also showed significantly reduced amygdala (22%) and hippocampus (11%) size but normal cognition. Amygdala and hippocampus size did not differ significantly between patients with and without PTSD. LIMITATIONS: The sample sizes of trauma-exposed groups are relatively small. A larger sample size may have revealed statistically significant differences in amygdala size between those with and without PTSD. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate strong amygdala size reduction in trauma-exposed patients with BPD with or without PTSD, much exceeding that reported for trauma-exposed individuals without BPD. Our data suggest that BPD is associated with small amygdala size. Furthermore, evidence is increasing that amygdala and hippocampus size reduction is not only due to PTSD, but also to traumatic exposure.",M2
19699062,"The serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and affective symptoms among women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.Gene variants of the serotonin transporter have been associated with vulnerability to affective disorders. In particular, the presence of one or two copies of the short (s) allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism has been associated with reduced serotonin transporter expression and function, and vulnerability to affective disorders. To test for an association between variants of the serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and relevant clinical features of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), a psychiatric disorder with symptoms characteristic for serotonin dysfunction, 77 women with BPD were genotyped in the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. They rated their subjective experience of borderline-specific, depressive, anxious and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and were interviewed about lifetime incidence of suicide attempts and self-harming acts. Carriers of two s alleles of the 5-HTTLPR reported more symptoms of borderline, depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviours, but not of suicidal and self-injury behaviour, compared to carriers of a long (l) allele. This indicates that the 5-HTTLPR ss homozygous genotype might influence serotonin function affecting susceptibility to both borderline-specific, depressive, anxious and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in BPD, and leading to a more severe symptomatology related to these clinical features. Further, this suggests that 5-HTT gene variants may not be as influential on suicidal and self-injury behaviour in BPD.",M2
19694631,"Impulsive aggression in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.OBJECTIVE: DSM-IV criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include examples of 'impulsivity'. This term can refer to various dysfunctional behaviours, including some examples of aggressive behaviour. However, impulsive aggression is not included in the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The associations of impulsive aggression with ADHD were investigated. METHOD: Seventy-three male adults with DSM-IV ADHD, and their informants, completed questionnaires. Impulsive aggression was assessed by ratings of two criteria for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), involving hot temper and/or self-harm. RESULTS: Logistic regression indicated that features of DSM-IV ADHD were predictors of comorbid impulsive aggression. However, compared with ADHD features, verbal IQ and comorbid psychopathology were more strongly associated with impulsive aggression. CONCLUSION: The findings support the inclusion of features of impulsive aggression, such as hot temper/short fuse, in the ADHD syndrome in adults. These overlap with features of BPD. The findings inform the selection of research samples.",M2
19689823,"Psychometric analysis of the self-harm inventory using Rasch modelling.BACKGROUND: Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) is the intentional destruction of healthy body tissue without suicidal intent. DSH behaviours in non-clinical populations vary, and instruments containing a range of behaviours may be more informative than ones with restricted content. The Self-Harm Inventory (SHI) is a widely used measure of DSH in clinical populations (mental and physical health) and covers a broad range of behaviours (self-injury, risk taking and self-defeating acts). The test authors recommend the SHI to screen for Borderline Personality Disorder (<e>BPD</e>) using a cut-off score of five or more. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of the SHI in non-clinical samples. METHODS: The SHI was administered to a sample of 423 non-clinical participants (university students, age range 17 to 30). External validation was informed by the administration of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) to a sub-sample (n = 221). Rasch analysis of the SHI was conducted to provide a stringent test of unidimensionality and to identify the DSH behaviours most likely to be endorsed at each total score. RESULTS: The SHI showed adequate fit to the Rasch model and no modifications were required following checks of local response dependency, differential item functioning and unidimensionality. The scale identified gender and age differences in scores, with females and older participants reporting higher levels of DSH. SHI scores and DASS-21 scores were related. CONCLUSION: The recommended cut-off point of five is likely to comprise mild forms of DSH and may not be indicative of psychopathology in a non-clinical population. Rather it may be more indicative of developmentally related risk taking behaviours while a higher cut-off point may be more suggestive of psychopathology as indicated by higher levels of depression, stress and anxiety.",M2
19689557,"Emotional pain: surviving mental health problems related to childhood experiences.Emotional pain is described as intense by women who suffer from borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>), and a high prevalence of reported childhood abuse was found in the literature and in research. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of women suffering from BPD with focus on emotional pain related to childhood. An explorative design was used. Data were collected from in-depth interviews consisting of women suffering from BPD (n = 13) and an interpretive content analysis was used to analyse the text. The findings revealed two main themes: 'Power' and 'Assessment of vulnerability'. The main theme 'Power' resulted in two categories: 'Surviving the feeling of being forced' and 'Surviving the feeling of having to assume responsibility'. The other main theme 'Assessment of vulnerability' had two categories: 'Surviving the feeling of being victimized' and 'Surviving the feeling of not being loved'. The findings suggest that nursing care need to develop an understanding of how these women endure their emotional pain, and try to survive as fighting spirits and how struggling became their way of life.",M2
19686431,"Impaired sexual function in patients with borderline personality disorder is determined by history of sexual abuse.INTRODUCTION: Patients suffering from a Borderline Personality Disorder (<e>BPD</e>) display altered sexual behavior, such as sexual avoidance or sexual impulsivity, which has repeatedly been linked to the sexual traumatization that occurs in a high percentage of BPD patients. Until now, no empirical data exists on whether these patients concomitantly suffer from sexual dysfunction. AIM: This study investigates sexual function and the impact of sexual traumatization on this issue in women with BPD as compared to healthy women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual function was measured using the Female Sexual Function Index. Additionally, diagnoses were made with SCID II Interviews for Axis II and with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Axis I disorders. The Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for trauma evaluation was used. Sexual orientation was assessed by self-evaluation. METHODS: Forty-five women with BPD as diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and 30 healthy women completed questionnaires on sexual function and sexual abuse history, as well as interviews on axis I and II disorders and psychotropic medication. RESULTS: The BPD group showed a significantly higher prevalence of sexual dysfunction. Subgroup analyses revealed that BPD with concomitant sexual traumatization, and not BPD alone, best explains impaired sexual function. Sexual inactivity was mainly related to current major depression or use of SSRI medication. In sexually active participants, medication and symptoms of depression had no significant impact on sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Not BPD alone, but concomitant sexual traumatization, predicts significantly impaired sexual function. This may have a therapeutic impact on BPD patients reporting sexual traumatization.",M2
19685950,"Disentangling emotion processes in borderline personality disorder: physiological and self-reported assessment of biological vulnerability, baseline intensity, and reactivity to emotionally evocative stimuli.This study investigated M. Linehan's (1993) theory that individuals meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) have high biological vulnerability to emotion dysregulation, including high baseline emotional intensity and high reactivity to emotionally evocative stimuli. Twenty individuals with BPD, 20 age-matched individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD), and 20 age-matched normal controls (NCs) participated in 2 separate emotion induction conditions, a standardized condition, and a personally relevant condition. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), skin conductance response (SCR), and self-report measures were collected throughout the experiment. BPD participants displayed heightened biological vulnerability compared with NCs as indicated by reduced basal RSA. BPD participants also exhibited high baseline emotional intensity, characterized by heightened SCR and heightened self-reported negative emotions at baseline. However, the BPD group did not display heightened reactivity, as their physiological and self-reported changes from baseline to the emotion inductions tasks were not greater than the other 2 groups.",M2
19663662,"The Core Conflictual Relationship Themes (CCRT) in borderline personality disorder.This study aimed to determine if the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) is associated with specific narrative descriptions of interpersonal functioning. Narratives of relationship episodes were scored using the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT) standard categories. The scores of 68 participants with BPD were compared to those of 139 participants with other personality disorders. Results on the CCRT standard categories showed that patients with BPD had more wishes to be distant and to be like others, and more wishes to be hurt and to hurt others; others were seen as controlling and bad; and patients with BPD were less open, helpful and self-confident than those without BPD. These findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on the interpersonal functioning of patients with BPD. How these findings may inform research on the effectiveness of treatment for BPD remains to be considered.",M2
19663660,"Social consequences of borderline personality disorder symptoms in a population-based survey: marital distress, marital violence, and marital disruption.Associations between borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) symptoms and marital distress, perpetration of marital violence, and marital dissolution were evaluated in a population-based sample of married adults. The incremental association between BPD symptom severity and marital outcomes was also examined, controlling for the presence of Axis I disorders. Respondents from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) who had been married at least once completed measures of BPD symptoms and provided information about their marital histories; a subset of participants completed measures of marital distress and marital violence. BPD symptom severity was positively associated with marital distress, perpetration of minor and severe marital violence, and marital disruption. Associations remained significant when controlling for presence of 12-month Axis I disorders. These findings underscore the importance of examining adverse social consequences of BPD.",M2
19663659,"Trust game reveals restricted interpersonal transactions in patients with borderline personality disorder.Patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) display severe difficulties in interpersonal relationships and impulse control. We explored the possibility that patients with BPD show less trust and more risk-taking behavior in experimental games as compared with controls and with depressed patients with other personality disorders. In the trust game, the participant played the role of an investor who interacted with a trustee via the Internet. The investor could choose a costly action by giving money units (MU) to the trustee. The trustee then could honor the investor's trust by sharing the monetary increase. In the risk game, the investor could transfer money to a lottery, and therefore the payoff depended on luck and not on the decision of another person. Results revealed that the patients with BPD (n = 25) transferred a smaller amount of MUs across 5 consecutive transactions in the trust game as compared with the controls (n = 25) and with the depressed patients (n = 25). In the risk game, the performance of the BPD patients was similar to that of the controls and depressed patients. Trust game performance was predicted by the interpersonal and cognitive sector scores of the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder. Self reports indicated that the patients with BPD were less optimistic regarding the outcome (payoff) of the trust game, but not of the risk game. These results suggest that patients with BPD exhibit less trust during interpersonal interactions, which may be related to stress-related paranoia, dissociation, identity disturbance, and problems in interpersonal relationships.",M2
19663657,"The role of affective instability and UPPS impulsivity in borderline personality disorder features.Current theories of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) suggest that extreme levels of affective instability/emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, or a combination of these traits account for the symptoms of BPD. The present study tested the extent to which personality measures of affective instability and impulsivity could account for BPD features in a nonclinical sample. One hundred forty-one undergraduates completed the Affective Lability Scale, the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Personality Assessment Inventory for Borderlines. Both affective instability and impulsivity were uniquely associated with BPD features. Shifts between euthymia and anger, and between anxiety and depression, were associated with BPD features, as were the urgency and (lack of) premeditation scales. Results indicated that specific BPD features may be differentially accounted for by affective instability vs. impulsivity, consistent with perspectives on BPD emphasizing combinations of affective instability and impulsivity as underlying dimensions of the disorder.",M2
19663656,"Family history study of the familial coaggregation of borderline personality disorder with axis I and nonborderline dramatic cluster axis II disorders.The purpose of this study was to assess the familial coaggregation of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) with a full array of axis I disorders and four axis II disorders (antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and sadistic personality disorder) in the first-degree relatives of borderline probands and axis II comparison subjects. Four hundred and forty-five inpatients were interviewed about familial psychopathology using the Revised Family History Questionnaire-a semistructured interview of demonstrated reliability. Of these 445 subjects, 341 met both DIB-R and DSM-III-R criteria for BPD and 104 met DSM-III-R criteria for another type of personality disorder (and neither criteria set for BPD). The psychopathology of 1,580 first-degree relatives of borderline probands and 472 relatives of axis II comparison subjects was assessed. Using structural models for familial coaggregation, it was found that BPD coaggregates with major depression, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and all four axis II disorders studied. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that common familial factors, particularly in the areas of affective disturbance and impulsivity, contribute to borderline personality disorder.",M2
19663655,"The 10-year course of social security disability income reported by patients with borderline personality disorder and axis II comparison subjects.This study had two purposes. The first purpose was to assess the prevalence as well as the stability of reliance on social security disability income (SSDI) among patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). The second purpose was to detail the prevalence of aspects of adult competence reported by borderline patients who ever received disability payments and those who never received such payments. The disability status and other aspects of psychosocial functioning of 290 borderline inpatients and 72 axis II comparison subjects were assessed using a semi-structured interview at baseline and at each of the five subsequent two-year follow-up periods. Borderline patients were three times more likely to be receiving SSDI benefits than axis II comparison subjects over time, although the prevalence rate for both groups remained relatively stable. Forty percent of borderline patients on such payments at baseline were able to get off disability but 43% of these patients subsequently went back on SSDI. Additionally, 39% of borderline patients who were not on disability at baseline started to receive federal benefits for the first time. However, borderline patients on SSDI were not without psychosocial strengths. By the time of the 10-year follow-up, 55% had worked or gone to school at least 50% of the last two years, about 70% had a supportive relationship with at least one friend, and over 50% a good relationship with a romantic partner. The results of this study suggest that receiving SSDI benefits is both more common and more fluid over time for patients with BPD than previously known.",M2
19663654,"Volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with borderline personality disorder: a meta-analysis.Individuals with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) often exhibit impulsive and aggressive behavior. The hippocampus and amygdala form part of the limbic system, which plays a central role in controlling such expressions of emotional reactivity. There are mixed results in the literature regarding whether patients with BPD have smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volume relative to healthy controls. To clarify the precise nature of these mixed results, we performed a meta-analysis to aggregate data on the size of the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with BPD. Seven publications involving six studies and a total of 104 patients with BPD and 122 healthy controls were included. A significantly smaller volume was found in both the right and left hippocampi and amygdala of patients with BPD compared to healthy controls. These findings raise the possibility that reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes are biological substrates of some symptoms of BPD.",M2
19660555,"Reduced prefrontal and orbitofrontal gray matter in female adolescents with borderline personality disorder: is it disorder specific?There is evidence that adults with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) are characterized by abnormalities in frontolimbic brain areas. In this study we aimed to determine whether brain volume alterations already exist in adolescents with BPD. Sixty female right-handed individuals (age range, 14-18 years), 20 with a DSM-IV diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, 20 patients with a DSM-IV defined current psychiatric disorder and 20 healthy control subjects were included. Groups were matched for age and IQ. Using a 3 T MRI scanner, we collected 1 mm axial sections using a three-dimensional sagittal isotropic Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence. Images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Voxel-based analysis revealed that adolescents with BPD showed reduced gray matter in the dorsolateral cortex (DLPFC) bilaterally and in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) relative to healthy control subjects. Adolescent clinical control subjects displayed significantly decreased gray matter volume in the right DLPFC in comparison with healthy control subjects. No significant gray matter differences were detected between the BPD group and the clinical control group. No group differences were found in the limbic system or in any white matter structures. The present study indicates that the early morphological changes in BPD are located in the PFC. However, these changes may not be BPD specific since similar changes were found in the clinical control group. Changes in limbic brain volumes and white matter structures might occur over the course of the illness.",M2
19657870,"Longing for reconciliation: a challenge for women with borderline personality disorder.The aim of this study was to explore the way in which traumatic childhood experiences influenced the daily life of women with Borderline Personality Disorder (<e>BPD</e>). An explorative design comprising in-depth interviews and a qualitative content analysis was used. The findings revealed one main theme-Longing for Reconciliation-comprising two themes: (1) Living with a sense of shame and guilt and (2) Struggling to be released from a sense of being trapped. Longing for reconciliation influenced the women's daily life as well as their search for the meaning of traumatic childhood experiences. New meaning can emerge through change, forgiveness, and reconciliation, thus helping women with BPD overcome their struggle and gain the insight and strength to look into their secret knowledge. Meaning can emerge and help them to develop an empathic understanding of themselves in the context of past and present relationships.",M2
19651401,"Neural correlates of the use of psychological distancing to regulate responses to negative social cues: a study of patients with borderline personality disorder.BACKGROUND: Emotional instability is a defining feature of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>); yet, little is understood about its underlying neural correlates. One possible contributing factor to emotional instability is a failure to adequately employ adaptive cognitive regulatory strategies such as psychological distancing. METHODS: To determine whether there are differences in neural dynamics underlying this control strategy between BPD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging signals were acquired as 18 BPD and 16 HC subjects distanced from or simply looked at pictures depicting social interactions. Contrasts in signal between distance and look conditions were compared between groups. RESULTS: Borderline personality disorder patients showed a different pattern of activation compared with HC subjects when looking at negative versus neutral pictures. When distancing versus looking at negative pictures, both groups showed decreased negative affect ratings and increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, areas near/along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate/precuneus regions. However, the BPD group showed less BOLD signal change in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and IPS, less deactivation in the amygdala, and greater activation in the superior temporal sulcus and superior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Borderline personality disorder and HC subjects display different neural dynamics while passively viewing social emotional stimuli. In addition, BPD patients do not engage the cognitive control regions to the extent that HCs do when employing a distancing strategy to regulate emotional reactions, which may be a factor contributing to the affective instability of BPD.",M2
19636254,"A preliminary study of lamotrigine in the treatment of affective instability in borderline personality disorder.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of lamotrigine in reducing affective instability in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 28 patients who met Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for BPD. Patients could not meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for bipolar disorder. Patients could be taking one antidepressant during the study. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with flexible-dose lamotrigine or placebo in a 1 : 1 manner. The primary outcome measures were: (i) the Affective Lability Scale total score; and (ii) the Affective Instability Item of the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD). The study randomized 15 patients to receive lamotrigine and 13 patients to receive placebo. Patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in the total Affective Lability Scale scores (P&lt;0.05) and significantly greater reductions in scores on the affective instability item of the ZAN-BPD (P&lt;0.05). A secondary finding was that patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in scores on the ZAN-BPD impulsivity item (P = 0.001). Results from the study suggest that lamotrigine is an effective treatment for affective instability and for the general impulsivity characteristic of BPD.",M2
19632284,"Insular cortex volume and impulsivity in teenagers with first-presentation borderline personality disorder.Fronto-limbic neural dysfunction has been implicated in the emotional dysregulation and impulsivity seen in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). However, it remains unclear whether affected individuals exhibit morphologic changes of the insular cortex, a fronto-limbic integration cortex engaged in emotional regulation and impulse control. This magnetic resonance imaging study examined the insular cortex volume and its relationship to clinical characteristics in a first-presentation teenage BPD sample. No significant difference was found in the insular volume between 20 BPD participants (5 males) and 20 healthy control participants (5 males). There was no association between the insular volume and parasuicidal episodes, trauma exposure, or comorbid Axis I disorders, but the BPD participants with violent episodes during the previous 6 months had a smaller insular volume bilaterally compared with those without such episodes. Furthermore, right anterior insular volume in the BPD participants was negatively correlated with impulsivity score. These preliminary findings suggest that insular cortex volume does not significantly differ in early BPD, but that there might be a relationship with violent and impulsive behavior that is often seen in the disorder. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the potential relationship between the insular cortex volume and impulsivity is specific to BPD.",M2
19630069,"Effectiveness of an emotion regulation group training for adolescents--a randomized controlled pilot study.Emotion Regulation Training (ERT) was developed for adolescents with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) and emotion dysregulation. ERT is an adaptation of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) programme. This paper describes the background of the programme, and gives an outline of the treatment programme. The effectiveness of ERT was examined in a randomized controlled pilot study with 43 youth (aged 14-19 years) in five mental health centres in the Netherlands. Subjects were assessed before and after random assignment to ERT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or to TAU alone (n = 20). Outcome measures included assessment of BPD symptoms, locus of control, and internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Both groups showed equal reductions in BPD symptoms over time. The group receiving ERT plus TAU (and not the TAU-only group) had a significant increase in internal locus of control: ERT participants reported more sense of control over their own mood swings, and attributed changes in mood swings not only to external factors. The study was complicated by a high attrition. The implications of the findings are discussed, including the difficulties inherent in treating and researching an adolescent population, and the need for researchers to develop age-appropriate assessments.",M2
19614553,"An empirical examination of three models of the interpersonal functioning of patients with borderline personality disorder.This study examined three empirically based models of the interpersonal functioning of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>). Samples of 77 patients with BPD and 81 patients with other personality disorders (PDs) were used to test models suggested by Diguer and colleagues (2001), Ruiz, Pincus, and Bedics (1999), and Stern, Herron, Primavera, and Kakuma (1997). The clusters and standard categories of the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme Method (CCRT) were used to investigate the participants' interpersonal functioning. Results indicated that two of the three models showed an overall difference between patients with BPD and those with other PDs, whereby patients with BPD felt more anxious and ashamed. None of the models tested showed differences between the two groups on the CCRT standard categories.",M2
19597355,"Interpersonal and emotional experiences of social interactions in borderline personality disorder.GENERAL AIM: We examined interpersonal experiences of patients with borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) using a time-contingent diary procedure to collect information about social interactions for 7 days. METHOD: We examined the (1) quantity of social interactions and (2) interpersonal and emotional experiences during social interactions for patients with BPD (BPD; N = 42) compared with those with another personality disorder (OPD; N = 46) and those without significant personality pathology (NOPD; N = 23). RESULTS: Results suggested that BPD patients have fewer social contacts compared with those in the NOPD group. Additionally, the BPD patients characterized their social interactions as more disagreeable, ambivalent, angry, empty, and sad compared with the OPD and NOPD groups. BPD patients reported experiencing more anxiety and less positive affect compared with the NOPD but not the OPD group. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight aspects of day-to-day interpersonal functioning that are specific to BPD.",M2
19591899,"Neuroligand binding endophenotypes in blood cells distinguish two subsets of borderline personality disorder patients.Neurotransmitter ligand binding in blood cells was assessed in borderline personality disorder (BDP) patients, testing the possibility that different biochemical endophenotypes might lie beneath a specific clinical presentation. The density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) and serotonin transporters were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and platelets, respectively, showing a decrease of both parameters. Moreover, a further significant decrease of PBR in PBMC was shown for those patients with a depressive trait. Further confirmation of the presence of different molecular endophenotypes underlying the dissimilar clinical presentations in <e>BPD</e> may advance our possibility of successfully treating these patients.",M2
19585341,"Dissociation in borderline personality disorder: a detailed look.The objective of the present study was to assess in detail the whole spectrum of normal and pathological dissociative experiences and dissociative disorder (DD) diagnoses in borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>) as diagnosed with the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines. Dissociation was measured comprehensively in 21 BPD outpatients using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders-Revised, the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation (MID), the Dissociative Experiences Scale pathological taxon analysis, and the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire. The frequencies of DDs in this BPD sample were as follows: 24% no DD, 29% mild DD (dissociative amnesia and depersonalization disorder), 24% DD Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS), and 24% dissociative identity disorder. With regard to the dissociative experiences endorsed, almost all patients reported identity confusion, unexplained mood changes, and depersonalization. Even those BPD patients with mild DD reported derealization, depersonalization, and dissociative amnesia. BPD patients with DDNOS reported frequent depersonalization, frequent amnesia, and notable experiences of identity alteration. BPD patients with dissociative identity disorder endorsed severe dissociative symptoms in all categories. Analysis of the MID pathological dissociation items revealed that 32% of the items were endorsed at a clinically significant level of frequency by more than 50% of our BPD patients. In conclusion, the frequencies of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) DDs in these patients with BPD were surprisingly high. Likewise, the  average  BPD patient endorsed a wide variety of recurrent pathological dissociative symptoms.",M2

We genotyped four HTR1B and the functional BDNF G196A marker in 161 Caucasian BPD patients and 156 healthy controls. There were no significant differences between groups in genotype or haplotype distribution of HTR1B markers or in genotype distribution of the BDNF marker.

19616307,"Impulsivity and borderline personality as risk factors for suicide attempts among opioid-dependent individuals.The study aimed to examine the association of impulsivity and screening positively for borderline personality disorder (<e>BPD</e>+) as risk factors for suicide attempts among opioid-dependent individuals. The study used a case-control design with 775 opioid-dependent cases and 306 non-opioid-dependent controls. Cases were more likely than controls to screen BPD+ and to be classed as highly impulsive. Significant risk for lifetime suicide attempt was associated with screening BPD+ and also with high impulsivity. A number of risk factors were identified for suicide attempts among those with either high impulsivity or among those who screened BPD+: being female, a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and a diagnosis of illicit drug dependence (other than opioid dependence). Opioid dependence was not a unique risk factor for suicide attempts among either the BPD+ group or the high impulsivity group. Although opioid dependence was not a unique risk factor for suicide attempts among those who screened BPD+, cases presented with multiple risk factors at substantially higher rates than controls. This research also highlights the importance of assessing impulsivity, in both clinical settings and research, particularly among those with a history of suicidal behaviour.",M2
