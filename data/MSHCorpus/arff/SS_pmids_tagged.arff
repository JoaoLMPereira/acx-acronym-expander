20198325,"Downregulation of SS18-SSX1 expression in synovial sarcoma by small interfering RNA enhances the focal adhesion pathway and inhibits anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is an aggressive soft-tissue malignancy characterized by a unique t(X;18) translocation resulting in expression of SS18-SSX fusion protein. In order to investigate the biological function of this fusion protein and to develop a novel therapeutic option, we examined downregulation of SS18-SSX1 expression by small interfering RNA targeting SS18-SSX1 in three human SS cell lines. Microarray analysis comparing SS18-SSX1-silenced cells with control cells in three SS cell lines showed that SS18-SSX1 mainly affected the focal adhesion pathway. In accord with the array data, silencing of SS18-SSX1 enhances adhesion to the extracellular matrix through the induction of expression of myosin light-chain kinase. Furthermore, the silencing of SS18-SSX1 inhibits anchorage-independent growth in vitro and systemic delivery of siRNA against SS18-SSX1 using a nanoparticle system inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. Our results demonstrate that siRNA targeting of SS18-SSX1 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of SS.",M1
19837269,"Novel SYT-SSX fusion transcript variants in synovial sarcoma.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by the t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) chromosomal translocation detected in &gt;95% of cases. Through this translocation, one of the SYT genes, SYT4 on chromosome 18, is fused to one of the SSX genes on chromosome X. SYT4-SSX1 is the most common fusion subtype, present in approximately two thirds of the cases, followed by SYT4-SSX2 and, very rarely, SYT4-SSX4. Variant fusion transcripts occur less often, and most of the reported cases are the result of small insertions. Described here is a novel fusion variant containing a small deletion resulting in an alternative reading frame of the SSX part of the fusion gene. This fusion transcript may provide further insight into the oncogenic function of the SSX partner of the fusion gene.",M1
19602458,"Molecular and immunohistochemical analyses of BCL2, KI-67, and cyclin D1 expression in synovial sarcoma.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that causes death in more than half of the affected patients. An immunohistochemical and molecular study of the BCL2, MKI67, and CCND1 genes (expressing the BCL2, KI-67, and cyclin D1 proteins, respectively) was performed to determine the expression profiles in correlation with mRNA levels, and to assess the possible utility of these genes as a potential target for the treatment. Cyclin D1 staining was identified in 18 of 30 cases (60%), and CCND1 mRNA was overexpressed in 15 of 32 cases (47%). KI-67 nuclear immunoreactivity was found in 14 of 29 cases (48%), and MKI67 mRNA was overexpressed in 12 of 32 cases (37.5%). The high level of MKI67 mRNA was observed predominantly in monophasic SS. BCL2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, was expressed in all 32 cases. The intensity of the BCL2 protein expression correlated well with the mRNA level (P&lt;0.0001). The high level of BCL2 mRNA correlated with a high level of CCND1 mRNA, but not with MKI67 mRNA level. Despite advances in therapy of sarcomas, the prognosis of patients with SS remains unfavorable, and a search for an improved therapy approach remains necessary. The strong immunopositivity of BCL2 in SS correlates well with a high level of BCL2 mRNA. Treatment with antisense BCL2 (G3139) may therefore represent an appropriate alternative therapy for patients with BCL2-positive synovial sarcomas.",M1
19559255,"A case of primary synovial sarcoma of the thorax with a variant SYT-SSX1 fusion transcript.With synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) of the thorax, being exceptionally rare, its definite diagnosis is difficult, and the optimal therapy has not yet been established. An examination of our patient, a 64-year-old man with SS using a chest roentgenogram showed a large mass with homogeneous density in the lower two-thirds of the left hemithorax. A computed tomographic image of the chest revealed a large, heterogeneous, enhanced mass in the left hemithorax. Histologic examination of the resected tumor tissues suggested monophasic fibrous SS. A fragment of the SYT-SSX1 fusion transcript, which was smaller than the control, was amplified with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analyses revealed the fusion between exon 9 of SYT and exon 5 of SSX1 instead of fusion between exon 10 of SYT and exon 6 of SSX1, which is found in most cases. Although the biological and clinical significance of this rare variant is not yet known, our data present another example of the usefulness of molecular analyses for making a definite diagnosis of SS in unusual sites.",M1
19514087,"Comparing children and adults with synovial sarcoma in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 1983 to 2005: an analysis of 1268 patients.BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a typical soft tissue sarcoma subtype crosswise between the pediatric and the adult age groups. Less satisfactory overall outcome has been recorded in adult series. METHODS: This study compares clinical features and outcomes of SS across the different age groups, by analyzing 1268 cases, 213 children/adolescents (&lt;or=18 years) and 1055 adults, registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 database from 1983 to 2005. Cancer-specific survival estimates were compared with univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS: No major differences in stage distribution (localized, regional, and distant stage) were observed comparing the 2 age groups. The estimated 5-year cancer-specific survival was 83% for children/adolescents and 62% for adults (P&lt;.001). Female sex, nonblack race, tumors located in the extremities, localized tumors, and tumors &lt;5 cm in size were associated with better survival. In multivariate analysis, adult patients had significantly higher mortality rates than children after adjusting for other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with SS have a similar clinical presentation but a dissimilar outcome, suggesting that factors other than unfavorable clinical features might be involved in the unsatisfactory outcome of adult SS patients. It remains to be ascertained whether this difference is related to biological variables or to historically different treatment approaches adopted in pediatric versus adult patients.",M1
19472813,"[Primary synovialosarcoma: a case of unusual location]AIM: Report a new case of primary Synovialosarcoma. CASE: We report a case of a 16 year old girl, who presented with a tumefaction on the right clavicle evolving for 3 months. Various explorations carried out, in particular thoracic scanner and imagery by magnetic resonance, showed a multilocular cystic formation of the seat and the clavicle reaching the mediastinum. A pathological examination of the part (piece) highlighted a biphasic synovialosarcoma of grade III. This diagnosis was validated by the immunohistochemistry study and the detection of transcribed specific fusion of the synovialosarcoma, SYT-SSX1. CONCLUSION: The unusual locations of the primitive <e>SS</e> must be known because the diversity of their microscopic aspects may cause confusion in the diagnosis. The immunohistochemistry, and more recently the cytogenetic studies, helps to solve these problems of differential diagnosis.",M1
19385976,"Prognostic implication of SYT-SSX fusion type and clinicopathological parameters for tumor-related death, recurrence, and metastasis in synovial sarcoma.The present study aimed to describe the distribution and features of the SYT-SSX fusion gene in Chinese patients with synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), and to analyze the prognostic value of SYT-SSX fusion type and clinicopathological parameters for tumor-related death, recurrence, and metastasis in SS. SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 141 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded SS. The prognostic implication of SYT-SSX fusion type and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed by univariate and multivariate survival analyses. SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 were detected in 50 (34.5%) and 91 (64.5%) tumors, respectively. SYT-SSX1 (risk ratio [RR] = 2.032, P = 0.004), larger tumor size (RR = 1.859, P = 0.008), and aggressive Fédération Nationale des Centers de Lutte Contre le Cancer grade (RR = 2.094, P = 0.001) were adverse predictors for disease-specific survival. However, SYT-SSX fusion type was not associated with local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.216). Patients with larger tumors (RR = 2.071, P = 0.005) and those who received marginal excision (RR = 2.556, P = 0.005) had poor local recurrence-free survival. Besides, SYT-SSX1 (RR = 1.859, P = 0.037), older age (RR = 1.799, P = 0.040), and aggressive International Union Against Cancer stage (RR = 3.690, P &lt; 0.001) proved to be adverse prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival. In conclusion, compared to SYT-SSX1, SYT-SSX2 was more frequent in Chinese patients with SS. Moreover, SYT-SSX1 was an adverse predictor for disease-specific survival and metastasis-free survival, but had no relation to local recurrence-free survival. In addition, histological grade and tumor size were also important prognostic factors for SS.",M1
19337641,"Primary monophasic synovial sarcoma of the duodenum confirmed by cytogenetic analysis with demonstration of t(X;18): a case report.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is an uncommon malignant neoplasm of the soft tissues. It mainly affects the periarticular tissues of the extremities in young adults, but has been described at nearly all sites; nevertheless, the gastrointestinal tract is an exceptional location. We report a case of a primary synovial sarcoma of the duodenum in a 69-year-old woman. Histological study showed a monophasic pattern. The tumor cells demonstrated diffuse vimentin and Bcl-2 expression, partial EMA expression and focal AE1/3 positivity. The differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with detection of the X;18 translocation. The patient presented postoperative complications and died one month following the intervention.",M1
19267417,"Synovial sarcoma: diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration by morphology and molecular analysis.BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by the t(X; 18) (p11.2; q11.2) translocation resulting in the SYT-SSX fusion transcript, detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology diagnosis of SS is challenging. We evaluated the applicability of RT-PCR on FNAs and to perform a detailed cytomorphological analysis in unequivocal cases of SS. METHODS: A prospective and retrospective analysis was performed over 4 years (2003-2007). Prospectively, FNAs positive for the SYT-SSX fusion transcript by RT-PCR (n = 6) and, retrospectively, cases proven on histopathology and immunohistochemistry (ICC; positivity for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen [EMA]/cytokeratin) as SS (n = 10) were included in the study. A detailed cytomorphological analysis was carried out. RESULTS: There were 9 biphasic and 7 monophasic tumors. The aspirates from both biphasic and monophasic tumors were richly cellular in all cases with micro tissue fragments. Pericapillary arrangement of tumor cells was present in most cases. Attempted gland formation was seen in 7 of 9 biphasic tumors. The individual tumor cells were round, ovoid, or spindle shaped. Pleomorphism was mild; monophasic tumors displayed lesser pleomorphism as compared with the biphasic ones. Nuclear chromatin was bland in all cases except 1 and nucleolar prominence was seen in just 3 biphasic tumors. Mast cells were seen in 3 biphasic and 2 monophasic tumors. Scanty to moderate extracellular matrix material was seen in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS: FNA cytology of SS shows a spectrum of cytomorphological features; the diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR on the aspirated material for the SYT-SSX fusion transcript.",M1
19088169,"Neo/adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve outcome in resected primary synovial sarcoma: a study of the French Sarcoma Group.BACKGROUND: There are only scarce data about the benefit of adjunctive chemotherapy in patients with localized synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 237 SS patients recorded in the database of the French Sarcoma Group were retrospectively analyzed. The respective impact of radiotherapy, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were assessed after adjustment to prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 58 months (range 1-321). Adjuvant, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy were administered in 112, 45 and 181 cases, respectively. In all, 59% of patients treated with chemotherapy received an ifosfamide-containing regimen. The 5-year OS, LRFS and DRFS rates were 64.0%, 70% and 57%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age &gt;35 years old, grade 3 and not-R0 margins were highly significant independent predictors of worse OS. After adjustment to prognostic factors, radiotherapy significantly improved LRFS but not DRFS or OS. Neither neo-adjuvant nor adjuvant chemotherapy had significant impact on OS, LRFS or DRFS. CONCLUSION: As for other high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas, well-planned wide surgical excision with adjuvant radiotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for SS. Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy should not be delivered outside a clinical trial setting.",M1
18774495,"Synovial sarcoma of the kidney.The renal parenchyma is a rare site of origin for primary synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). The present study describes the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of 7 cases of SS occurring in the kidney. There were 5 female and 2 male patients, with an age range of 15 to 46 years. They presented with solitary renal masses ranging in size from 10.0 cm to 17.0 cm in greatest dimension. Radical nephrectomy was performed in all cases. On gross examination, tumors were large, partially necrotic, and were seen to contain smooth-walled cysts in 4 cases. Histologically, the tumors were characterized by monomorphic spindle cells with indistinct cell borders arranged in intersecting nodular foci with hypocellular myxoid areas, together with a prominent hemangiopericytomatous pattern. The cysts were lined by hobnailed cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, BCL-2 was positive in all 6 cases in which it was performed, followed by vimentin (4/5 cases), MIC2 (CD99; 2/5 cases), calponin (2/2 cases), and epithelial membrane antigen (1/4 cases). Stains for cytokeratin and CD34 were consistently negative. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was carried out in 4 cases and SYT-SSX fusion gene transcript, which is the diagnostic hallmark of SS, was detected. Two patients developed pulmonary metastasis and died 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, respectively. This series of cases is distinct in terms of its morphological spectrum and confirmation by molecular technique.",M1
18642280,"Synovial sarcoma of the head and neck: rare case of cervical metastasis.BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma is a rarely encountered soft tissue sarcoma. Surgery with a wide surgical margin is the treatment of choice. However, there is no consensus on the treatment of head and neck synovial sarcoma in patients with cervical metastasis. METHODS: A 20-year-old man was seen with a palpable mass in the right neck. He had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma of the right tonsil and treated by surgery 1 and a half years before; therefore, the mass detected was thought to be a cervical metastasis of synovial sarcoma. We performed a modified radical neck dissection with no postoperative treatment. The pathological diagnosis was confirmed by detecting the <e>SS</e>-specific fusion gene SYT-SSX1. RESULTS: The patient remains free of recurrence or metastasis 2 years and 10 months after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We encountered a case of head and neck synovial sarcoma with cervical metastasis that was successfully treated.",M1

The authors report a 10-year-old boy with SYT-SSX1 positive left parapharyngeal SS, resistant to front-line VAIA chemotherapy, who obtained a good partial response by salvage regimen (I(3)VE + CEV + I(3)VE) and local radiotherapy, so a complete surgical resection could be performed. The complete remission was subsequently consolidated by ablative high-dose chemotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell reinfusion. The child remains in complete remission at 36 months after completion of treatment.",M1
18555467,"Retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma: a clinicopathological study of 6 cases.PURPOSE: Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) arising in the retroperitoneum is a rare tumor. In this location it can be confused with other biphasic tumors and with other spindle and round cell sarcomas. We report 6 cases of SSs with emphasis on their clinicopathological findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six cases were studied, diagnosed as primary retroperitoneal SSs. Clinical, radiological and pathological findings were included in the study. Follow-up information was available in 5 out of 6 cases. RESULTS: The cases consisted of 5 males and 1 female (aged 27-42 years, median 34), who complained preoperatively for pain in the abdominal region (n=4) and dysuria (n=2). Clinical examination was negative. Abdominal X-ray showed a suspicious mass in 4 cases and computed tomography (CT) revealed the tumor mass in all cases. Surgical removal of the tumor was performed. Tumors ranged in size from 6.5 to 14 cm (median 11); histologically, all tumors were biphasic and 1 had poorly differentiated areas. Sarcomas were of high grade (n=3) and intermediate grade of malignancy (n=3). Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, S-100, CD34, EMA, SMA and CD99 were performed. All tumors recurred or metastasized within the abdomen. Four patients died of disease within 8-38 months. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal SSs are very rare neoplasms that attain a large size, are difficult to excise and recur locally. Metastatic potential is low; however, mortality is very high.",M1
18555039,"MRI features of three paediatric intra-articular synovial lesions: a comparative study.AIM: To determine reliable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features differentiating three paediatric intra-articular congenital or neoplastic synovial lesions that contain blood products, from post-traumatic or haemorrhagic inflammatory processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of MRI findings of 22 paediatric intra-articular congenital or neoplastic synovial lesions, including venous malformation (VM) (n=12), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS; n=8), and synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>; n=2). These MRI features were compared with 22 paediatric post-traumatic or inflammatory intra-articular processes containing blood products and producing mass effect. The following imaging features were assessed: presence of a discrete mass, extension, extra-articular oedema, susceptibility, joint effusion, and size. Fisher's exact test was used and results were considered statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: The three intra-articular synovial lesions, compared with controls, were more likely to directly invade osseous structures when a discrete mass was present (13/16, 81.3% versus 1/9, 11.1%; p&lt;0.002) and extend into extra-articular soft tissues (13/21, 61.9% versus 2/17, 11.8%; p&lt;0.003), but were less likely to show extra-articular oedema (3/22, 13.6% versus 13/22, 59.1%; p&lt;0.004), a joint effusion (10/22,45.5% versus 19/22, 86.4%, p&lt;0.01), susceptibility within a joint effusion (0/22, 0% versus 11/22, 40.9%; p=0.00), osseous oedema (3/16, 18.8% versus 7/9, 77.8%; p&lt;0.009), and synovial enhancement (8/21, 38.1% versus 14/16, 87.5%; p&lt;0.003). VMs had characteristic tubular vessels with internal fluid-fluid levels (11/12) that extended into bone (10/12) and extracapsular soft tissues (11/12). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that, despite the overlapping presence of haemorrhagic products, intra-articular VM, PVNS, and SS show MRI features that permit distinction from acquired post-traumatic and haemorrhagic inflammatory lesions.",M1
18460022,"The diagnostic value of SYT-SSX detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for synovial sarcoma: a review and prospective study of 255 cases.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of SYT-SSX detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) in known and potential cases. SYT-SSX was analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of 62 known SS, 60 non-SS and 133 potential SS by RT-PCR and FISH. FISH was mainly performed on a tissue microarray with some modifications. SYT-SSX was detected in 94.7% (54/57) of known SS and 70.5% (86/122) of potential SS by RT-PCR and in 96.7% (58/60) of known SS and 78.1% (100/128) of potential SS by FISH. Moreover, SYT-SSX was negative in 100% (58/58) of non-SS by RT-PCR and in 100% (59/59) of non-SS by FISH. Accordingly, SYT-SSX was detected in 106 potential SS by RT-PCR or FISH, including 80 cases manifested by both methods, 20 specimens verified only by FISH and 6 samples confirmed only by RT-PCR. Clinical findings and immunohistochemistry data were analyzed in potential SS with final molecular diagnosis. The positive ratio of cytokeratin (CK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) in finally diagnosed SS was 51.9% (55/106) and 61.3% (65/106), respectively. Except EMA, clinical parameters (age, sex, tumor size, tumor sites) and other immunohistochemistry indexes (CK, S-100, neurone specific enolase (NSE), CD99, myoglobin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), cluster of differentiation (CD) 68 and mesothelial cell) had no significant difference between finally diagnosed SS and non-SS. It is indicated that the efficiency of FISH is comparable to or even higher than that of RT-PCR for SYT-SSX detection. The detection of SYT-SSX by RT-PCR or FISH is very useful for the final diagnosis of potential synovial sarcomas.",M1
18440800,"Synovial sarcoma of children and adolescents: the prognostic role of axial sites.BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients with non-extremity synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is generally worse than that of patients with limb tumours. METHODS: The present study analysed a series of 115 consecutive SS patients treated in Italian paediatric protocols (period 1979-2005), mainly focusing on the 30 cases arising from 'axial' sites (16 head-neck, 8 trunk, 4 lung-pleura and 2 retroperitoneum). RESULTS: Initial gross resection was achieved in 40% of axial cases and in 80% of limb SS (p&lt;0.0001). Five-year EFS and overall survival (OS) were, respectively, 43.3% and 55.1% for axial SS, and 69.6% (p=0.0068) and 84.0% (p=0.0004) for extremity SS. Local progression/recurrence was the cause of treatment failure in 75% of relapsing patients axial disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasise that children and adolescents with SS originating at non-extremity locations have a worse prognosis than those with limb SS. Tumour site should be considered when defining a risk-adapted treatment strategy for SS.",M1

18367418,"Primary intravascular synovial sarcoma of the femoral vein in a male patient, case report.Synovial Sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is an aggressive neoplasm commonly affecting deep soft tissues of the extremities. In rare instances SS can arise in large veins of the lower extremities or trunk. We report the first case of intravascular synovial sarcoma (IVSS) occurring in a male patient. A biphasic tumor was diagnosed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Molecular analysis at RNA level confirmed the diagnosis demonstrating the chromosomal translocation t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2) in the tumor. Although extremely rare, IVSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary intravascular neoplasms and as a potential cause of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.",M1
18301245,"Diagnostic accuracy of FISH and RT-PCR in 50 routinely processed synovial sarcomas.BACKGROUND: Molecular detection of SYT-SSX fusion genes is the most reliable tool for diagnosing synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a commercially available fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty tumors with typical SS histology and 12 histologic mimics of SS were included. RT-PCR for SYT-SSX1/SSX2 gene fusions and FISH analysis for SYT gene breaks were performed on these 62 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors. RESULTS: All 50 SS were positive by either RT-PCR or FISH. Forty-seven SS (94%) were true positive by RT-PCR and 41 SS (82%) were true positive by FISH. FISH and RT-PCR results were interpretable and concordant in 38 cases (76%). Two cases were not interpretable by RT-PCR and 6 cases were not interpretable by FISH. One SS was false-negative with RT-PCR and 3 SS were false-negative with FISH. RT-PCR and FISH had a sensitivity of 94% and 82%, a specificity and positive predictive value of 100% and 100% and a negative predictive value of 80% and 75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR had a higher sensitivity than FISH. One of both methods was always positive, whereas both methods were concordant in 76% of cases. From an economic point of view, we advocate to use FISH as a method of first choice, because it allows microscopic control of a true positive result (unpaired fluorescent signals in a break apart assay). Using this approach, 80% of SS can be diagnosed by FISH only and 20% would need to be confirmed by RT-PCR.",M1
18231962,"[Synovial sarcoma of the head and neck]BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a mesenchymal malignancy, which predominantly occurs at the lower extremities of young adults. Only 3 % of the SS show a primary manifestation in the head and neck region. METHODS: A retrospective chart review (years 2002 - 2006) of our Department of Otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery, School of Medicine, Bonn, Germany, was performed searching for patients with primary head and neck manifestations of SS. PATIENTS: Four patients (2 female, 2 male) with a median age of 21 (12 - 28) years were assessed at our facility. RESULTS: The location of the SS was the oropharynx respectively, infiltrating adjacent structures. 3 patients underwent radical surgery followed by chemotherapy, 2 in combination with irradiation. 1 patient underwent primary chemotherapy and irradiation. The histological diagnosis was a biphasic SS as well as a monophasic SS in 2 patients respectively. Fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization was performed in order to detect the distinctive chromosomal translocation t(X;18). 2 patients were in complete remission at the recent follow-up, 1 patient died 14 months after diagnosis due to a lethal carotidal haemorrhage. 1 patient was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The aggressive character of the SS as well as its high recurrence rate afford a radical therapeutic scheme enclosing surgical, chemotherapeutical and radiological treatment as well as a thorough follow-up. The genetic translocation t(X;18) leads the way to the right diagnosis. The prognosis of head and neck SS must be considered as poor. SS should be taken into consideration in head and neck tumors of unclear nature.",M1
17982647,"Synovial sarcoma of the extremities and trunk: a long-lasting disease.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) of an extremity or trunk is relatively rare and is approached by limb sparing surgery (LSS), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and histopathological data of 73 patients with proven SS. At a median follow-up time of 6 years, local recurrence was seen in 17.8 and systemic recurrence 35.6% of patients (local-only, 6.8; systemic-only, 24.6; combined, 11%). The 10-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), systemic recurrence-free survival (SRFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 78, 68 and 61%, respectively. LRFS was significantly better in patients treated with isolated limb perfusion (ILP); SRFS was influenced by the delay until diagnosis. The practical aspects of our observations are the need for long-term follow-up in order to diagnose recurrences, the fact that not all local or distant recurrences are necessarily associated with a shortening of OS time and the important role of induction ILP with TNF in cases of extremity SS.",M1
17274049,"Survival in patients with synovial sarcoma of the head and neck: association with tumor location, size, and extension.BACKGROUND: The medical literature on synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) of the head and neck region is limited. Thus, we determined whether clinical characteristics and treatment were associated with recurrence and survival rates in patients with SS of the head and neck. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with a pathologic diagnosis of SS of the head and neck at our institution (a large tertiary comprehensive cancer center) and compared recurrence and survival rates by clinical characteristics and treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients with SS of the head and neck were identified from 1945 to 2004 (first case in 1968), representing &lt;5% of all head and neck sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period. Twenty-three patients (58%) had the monophasic histologic subtype, 15 (38%) biphasic, and 2 unspecified. Most patients were male (73%), with a median age of 29 years. SS tumors were most commonly located in the neck (60%); thus, the most common symptoms were a neck mass and neck pain. No patients reported a history of radiation exposure. Higher disease-specific and overall survival rates were associated with upper aerodigestive tract location, tumors of &lt; or =5 cm, and tumors did not extend into bone. Patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy had higher survival and lower recurrence rates than did those treated with surgery alone or a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. This difference was not significant, and the subgroups were small, with substantial confounding by adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: SS of the head and neck is extremely rare, and our results should be viewed with caution given the relatively small group size and treatment over a 36-year period. Survival rates were associated with tumor location, size, and extension. Treatment of SS of the head and neck should be directed toward complete surgical resection. Given the known sensitivity of SS to contemporary chemotherapy, a multimodality approach should be considered in the perioperative setting, especially in high risk patients.",M1
17980783,"Synovial sarcoma of the infratemporal fossa.OBJECTIVES: A case is reported in which synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is arising within the infratemporal fossa. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case report and literature review from an academic tertiary referral practice. RESULTS: A 46-year-old white woman presented with a 1-month history of having paresthesias on the left side of her head. There was a sensory deficit at the level of the third division dermatome (V3) of the fifth left cranial nerve. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass centered in the left infratemporal fossa. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) revealed a spindle cell neoplasm. An endoscopic, transantral biopsy of the mass revealed SS. The SS in the infratemporal fossa was surgically removed en bloc. The patient had postoperative chemoradiotherapy and is free of disease at 1 year from completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case from the United States of America of SS located in the infratemporal fossa and the third case to be reported in the English language literature.",M1
17121200,"Diagnostic pitfalls associated with fine-needle aspiration biopsy in a patient with the myxoid variant of monophasic fibrous synovial sarcoma.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is one of the most common soft tissue tumors that typically presents in the extremities of young adults, but may occur at any site and affect children during the first decade. Herein we discuss a 12-yr-old male who complained of left foot pain and plantar mass. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an 8 cm subcutaneous mass was performed revealing a myxoid spindle cell neoplasm. The cytologic differential diagnosis included a myxoid neurofibroma, neurothekeoma, and a myxoid sarcoma. Subsequent excision of the mass revealed a monophasic fibrous SS with myxoid features. Examination of the tissue by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of characteristic SS SYT gene rearrangement at chromosome 18q11.2. This case underscores that the cytologic distinction of mxyoid spindle cell tumors may be challenging. We report the cytologic features of a myxoid monophasic fibrous SS, and discuss its distinction from other benign and malignant myxoid soft tissue neoplasms.",M1

IL-1beta, a pleiotrophic cytokine, has been found in the tumor microenvironment which plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of tumors. METHODS: In this study, we used Hs701.T as a cellular model to study the short-term (4-h) and long-term (48-h) stimulatory effect of IL-1beta on cell proliferation and differential gene expression. RESULTS: The results showed that IL-1beta can stimulate cell proliferation through activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors; sequentially triggers the expression of genes related to tumor progression. The microarray data indicated that most of the up-regulated genes were related to tumor progression. Five candidate genes which are involved in the mediation of proliferation (IL-6), apoptosis (Hsp27 and Daxx), and angiogenesis (PlGF and SPARC) were further validated by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: These findings may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of synovial sarcoma.",M1
17175375,"Evaluation of genetic stability of the SYT gene rearrangement by break-apart FISH in primary and xenotransplanted synovial sarcomas.Synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) are infrequent and morphologically heterogeneous soft tissue sarcomas. The t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in fusion of the SYT gene at 18q11 with the SSX1, SSX2, or (rarely) SSX4 gene is a primary genetic event in 90% of SS. To determine whether the t(X;18) present in the original tumor is maintained in its passages, a dual-color break-apart FISH assay for SYT gene disruption was performed in two tissue microarrays (TMA) comprising eight molecularly confirmed primary SSs and their xenografts, which were followed for several generations. A simplified scoring system was applied to the FISH results of the primary and xenotransplanted SS to classify the FISH data into distinct groups. SYT disruption was identified in all eight primary SS and in all their passages without any significant differences among them, despite wide variations in xenotransplantation time between the primary tumors and their xenografts. The TMA-based FISH assay demonstrated genetic stability related to SYT gene rearrangement in primary and xenografted SS.",M1
16740029,"Beta-catenin nuclear expression correlates with cyclin D1 expression in primary and metastatic synovial sarcoma: a tissue microarray study.CONTEXT: The association between aberrant (nuclear) beta-catenin expression and cyclin D1 accumulation has been demonstrated in diverse neoplasms. In synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), aberrant beta-catenin expression has prognostic relevance, but the association with cyclin D1 has not been established. The SYT-SSX fusion protein, unique to SS, may independently increase cyclin D1. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nuclear beta-catenin is associated with cyclin D1 overexpression in SS and whether primary and metastatic SS differ in the expression of these markers. DESIGN: We incorporated 82 tumors initially diagnosed as SS into a tissue array. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with custom probes was used to select t(X;18) positive tumors. Clinical data, tumor type and outcome were tabulated. The tumors were tested for the association between nuclear beta-catenin and cyclin D1 immunostaining. Primary and metastatic tumors were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-one tumors (41 primary and 10 metastatic) from 43 patients demonstrated t(X;18). Cyclin D1 staining was identified in 21 (59%) primary and 8 (80%) metastatic tumors, respectively, and nuclear beta-catenin in 24 (41%) primary and 7 (70%) metastatic tumors, respectively. No significant difference was noted between primary and metastatic tumors with respect to the above markers. The presence of nuclear beta-catenin showed a significant association with cyclin D1 expression (P &lt; .001). A small number of cyclin D1 cases were negative for nuclear beta-catenin but positive for phosphorylated Akt. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cyclin D1 in SS may be driven by abnormally expressed beta-catenin, similar to other neoplasms. The pattern of expression of these markers is established early during tumorigenesis.",M1

A heterozygous p16INK4A gene deletion was identified in 28 (74%) of 38 cases, with 25 (89%) of them showing abnormal p16 protein expression (20 negative and 5 heterogeneous). Of 25 cases, 19 (76%) exhibiting increased cyclin D1expression also demonstrated heterozygous p16INK4A deletion. No significant association was observed between p16INK4A deletion and Ki-67 proliferation index, tumor grade, or histologic subtype. Our results demonstrate that p16INK4A (CDKN2A) gene deletion is a frequent genetic event in SS.",M1
16557383,"Chromosomal and genetic imbalances in synovial sarcoma detected by conventional and microarray comparative genomic hybridization.PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between chromosomal instabilities and clinicopathological factors in synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). METHODS: Twenty-two fresh-frozen SS were analyzed by metaphase comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Additional microarray CGH was performed in 13 cases. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with SYT-SSX1 rearrangements and nine patients with biphasic tumor subtypes had better prognosis than the eight patients with SYT-SSX2 rearrangements and 13 patients with monophasic subtypes, respectively. Gains (average 3.0) were more frequent than losses (average 1.0). Frequent gains were identified on chromosomal regions 2, 6q, 7, 8q, 12, 17q, 18q, and 21q, whereas frequent losses were over-lapped on chromosomes 1p31-p35, 3p, 6q, 16, and 17p. High-level gains were observed on chromosomes 1q21-q31, 7, 8, 12, 17q, 18q, and 21q. Thirteen monophasic and nine biphasic tumors had an average of 5.1 and 2.8 aberrations, respectively. Patients with tumors harboring numerous aberrations (&gt;or=3) had a worse clinical course. Microarray CGH more specifically detected genetic imbalances including gains in MDM2, MSH2, KCNK12, DCC, CDK2, ERBB3, SAS, and CDK4 and losses in HRAS, RASSF1, and CCND1. Gain of SAS was an important prognostic factor of SS. CONCLUSION: We have identified several factors influencing the prognosis of SS patients by metaphase and microarray CGH.",M1

16705698,"Doxorubicin induces cell senescence preferentially over apoptosis in the FU-SY-1 synovial sarcoma cell line.Surgical resection coupled with adjuvant radiotherapy and/or doxorubicin based chemotherapy are the mainstays of synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) treatment. Although effective as a SS adjuvant, the proposed mechanism of action of doxorubicin remains controversial. Current opinion supports DNA damage-induced apoptosis. This in vitro study used cDNA gene expression profiling to investigate whether apoptosis, alone or in combination with cell senescence, is induced by doxorubicin in SS cells. Cell cultures of the FU-SY-1 SS, the pleomorphic SW982 sarcoma, and a primary dermal fibroblast (NHDF), were exposed to 500 nM doxorubicin, and then processed for cDNA microarray analysis. The one class response option of SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was used to test for significant overexpression of 15 apoptosis-related genes and nine senescence-related genes. Drug-induced cell senescence was quantified by measuring beta-galactosidase activity. None of 15 apoptosis-related genes and only two of nine senescence-related genes were identified by SAM as significantly overexpressed in doxorubicin-treated cultures. Drug-induced senescence as reflected by beta-galactosidase activity was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) only in FU-SY-1 SS cultures. Apoptosis does not appear to be a major determinant of doxorubicin-induced mortality in FU-SY-1 SS or NHDF cultures, but may impact SW982 cells via the overexpression of BAX relative to Bcl-2. Doxorubicin-induced cell senescence was prominent in FU-SY-1 SS cultures, but negligible in SW982 and NHDF cultures. Likely, both apoptosis and cell senescence contribute to doxorubicin-induced cell death in this synovial sarcoma cell line.",M1

Needle biopsy showed a  small round blue cell tumour , and a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET)/Ewing sarcoma was suggested on the basis of the imaging appearances. The definitive diagnosis of synovial sarcoma was made following molecular genetic studies, which demonstrated a fusion product incorporating the genes SYT and SSX1.

Recent gene-expression profiles of soft-tissue tumors using cDNA microarray demonstrated that SS has the distinct gene-expression pattern from other sarcomas and has a similar pattern to that of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, indicating that the origin of SS is likely to be the neural crest cells. Through this analysis, several genes were found to be specifically upregulated in SS and considered to play an important role in the proliferation of SS cells. Among them, Frizzled homolog 10 was identified as a good candidate molecule for the development of novel therapies to treat SS patients.",M1
16733209,"Nuclear beta-catenin correlates with cyclin D1 expression in spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas but not in synovial sarcoma.Nuclear beta-catenin staining in soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) has been shown to correlate with tumor progression as assessed by proliferative activity or poor prognosis. Frequent activation of Wnt signaling pathway has been also shown in synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), suggesting a specific role of this pathway in SS. We examined roles of nuclear beta-catenin staining within soft tissue sarcomas. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear beta-catenin accumulation correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression in spindle cell and pleomorphic sarcomas (P = .037), and the expression of these proteins evenly distributed throughout each section. In some cases, strong beta-catenin nuclear staining was observed in highly pleomorphic and mitotic cells. Furthermore, tumors with nuclear beta-catenin accumulation showed statistically significant increasing cyclin D1 mRNA expression level compared with those without (P = .023). Cyclin D1 mRNA expression levels were statistically higher in tumors with cyclin D1 overexpression than in tumors without (P = .037), suggesting that cyclin D1 overexpression is due to transcriptional activation. However, these correlations could not be detected in SS. In biphasic SS, beta-catenin nuclear staining was observed in spindle cells, whereas cyclin D1 nuclear staining was seen in glandular areas where beta-catenin kept membranous expression. Mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene and in the mutation cluster region of adenomatous polyposis coli gene were absent in this series of cases. Thus, cyclin D1 could be considered as one of the targets of the nuclear beta-catenin in spindle cell and pleomorphic sarcomas. A possible association between beta-catenin accumulation and spindle cell morphogenesis may exist in SS.",M1
16292743,"Grossly-resected synovial sarcoma treated by the German and Italian Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Cooperative Groups: discussion on the role of adjuvant therapies.Differently from adult oncologists that considered synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) a tumor with uncertain chemosensitiveness, since two decades pediatric oncologists in Europe assumed that chemotherapy played an important role in SS treatment, so most pediatric patients were included in rhabdomyosarcoma protocols, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of risk factors. The German and Italian groups reviewed the data of grossly resected SS patients in order to define a risk-adapted treatment program for the next European protocol. A total of 150 patients &lt; 21 years with localized SS who underwent initial gross resection between 1975 and 2002 were the object of this study. All but four cases received adjuvant chemotherapy. Post-operative radiotherapy was administered to 50% Group I and to 92% Group II patients. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 77% and 89%, respectively. Survival rates were influenced by tumor size (EFS 92% and 56% for size &lt; or = and &gt; 5 cm, respectively) and local invasiveness, not by surgical margins. No metastatic relapses occurred in Group I &lt; or = 5 cm patients, while the outcome was poor for T2B patients (EFS 41%) due to a high rate of metastatic relapse. Our study was unable to assess the role of adjuvant treatments in grossly-resected SS, but identified a subset of low-risk patients (IRS Group I, size &lt; or = 5 cm), for which the omission of adjuvant chemotherapy could be suggested, and a subset of high-risk patients (T2B), who need treatment intensification.",M1
16106193,"Mutational analysis of the c-KIT AND PDGFRalpha in a series of molecularly well-characterized synovial sarcomas.The c-KIT and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) have been shown to be important for tumor growth and progression in several soft-tissue sarcomas, including synovial sarcomas (<e>SSs</e>). It has been suggested that these c-KIT-positive cases might benefit from a tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In this study, we analyze a series of SSs to investigate the presence of c-KIT and PDGFRalpha mutations with the aim of selecting those for a more adequate and appropriate therapy. We analyzed fresh-frozen tissues from 12 SSs (8 primary tumors and 4 nude mice xenotransplants from primary tumors). RNA was extracted to identify the presence of the SYT-SSX gene fusion to confirm the SS diagnosis. Mutational analysis of exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of c-KIT and exons 12 and 18 of PDGFRalpha was performed by direct sequencing. Immunohistochemical analysis of c-KIT, PDGFRalpha, and p-PDGFRalpha was also performed. All analyzed cases showed the presence of SYT-SSX gene fusion transcripts confirming the diagnosis of SS, 10 carried the SYT-SSX1 fusion, and 2 the SYT-SSX2. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of c-KIT in 3 cases in which no molecular alterations were detected. For the PDGFRalpha, we observed an in-frame deletion of codons 554 and 555 in a case which also showed a strong immunopositivity for the phosphorylated form of PDGFRalpha. PDGFRalpha expression was observed in 8 cases. We suggest that a more exhaustive mutational analysis of the c-KIT and PDGFRalpha genes should be performed to ascertain which cases would really benefit from a tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in SS.",M1
16195766,"Her-2 oncogene amplification, chromosome 17 and DNA ploidy status in synovial sarcoma.The treatment options for synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) are very limited, though this type of sarcoma seems to be more heterogeneous than it has been traditionally considered. The present study investigates the Her-2 oncogene status of 20 cases of SS, to determine whether Her-2 amplification can be considered as a prognostic factor. Her-2 oncogene amplification was determined on smears (frozen material was used from our tumor bank in each case), using fluorescence in situ hybridization technique (dual color FISH with centromeric probe for chromosome 17 and specific probe for Her-2 oncogene). Moreover, protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and DNA ploidy status was measured using image analysis. We had 5 biphasic and 15 monophasic SSs, patients' age ranged from 13 to 68 years (mean, 39.8 years). Tumor size was larger than 5 cm in each case. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 78 months (mean, 38.5 months). For statistical analysis the chi-square test was used. Her-2 oncogene amplification was found in three cases (15.0%) of 20 SSs. These cases proved to be 2+ positive by immunohistochemistry, but massive amplification, characteristic of a subset of breast carcinomas, was not observed. Her-2 oncogene amplification was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing metastasis (P&lt;0.05) (none of the 3 amplified cases had metastases), while no association was found with recurrence. Six cases proved to be aneuploid and 14 were diploid, but no association was found between Her-2 amplification status and ploidy, and between ploidy status and metastasis or recurrence. Our results emphasize and confirm that Her-2 oncogene amplification is a rare event in SS, but the small subset of SS with Her-2 amplification has a better overall prognosis. Furthermore, this may open a theoretically new treatment possibility with Trastuzumab for Her-2-amplified cases of SS.",M1
16450387,"G3139 antisense oligonucleotide directed against antiapoptotic Bcl-2 enhances doxorubicin cytotoxicity in the FU-SY-1 synovial sarcoma cell line.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a highly aggressive, periarticular soft tissue sarcoma that causes death in more than half of affected children, adolescents, and young adults. Five- and 10-year survival rates are as low as 36 and 20%, respectively. Bcl-2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, is overexpressed in up to 90% of SS. Increased Bcl-2 expression not only leads to the development of cancer, but also to resistance of many anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesized reducing Bcl-2 expression in SS should enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Cell cultures representing two human sarcomas (FU-SY-1 SS and the pleomorphic SW982) and a primary human dermal fibroblast comparator (NHDF) were exposed in vitro to doxorubicin, or to doxorubicin preceded by Bcl-2 (G3139) antisense oligonucleotides, and assayed for cell survival, apoptosis, and modulations in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA and protein content. SW982 sarcoma cells proved most susceptible to doxorubicin, while NHDF mesenchymal cells were least sensitive to doxorubicin. Treatment of FU-SY-1 SS with G3139 reduced Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels, which enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell killing. There was a concurrent reduction in Bcl-xL mRNA following G3139 application in FU-SY-1 and NHDF cultures, but not in SW982. G3139 anti-Bcl-2 intervention sensitized the FU-SY-1 SS to doxorubicin, due to increased apoptosis. G3139 intervention was ineffective in the two non-SS cell lines.",M1
16142418,"Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization for SYT-SSX fusion gene transcripts in synovial sarcomas.More than 90% of synovial sarcomas (<e>SSs</e>) possess a non-random chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) and express SYT-SSX fusion gene products originating from the translocation. To test whether it is possible to detect the SYT-SSX mRNA on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded SS tissue sections using PCR-based in situ amplification technique, we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization (RT-PCR ISH) for the SYT-SSX fusion gene mRNA. In three types of SSs, monophasic fibrous, biphasic and poorly differentiated, NBT/BCIP signals corresponding to SYT-SSX mRNA were uniformly and predominantly positive in the sarcoma cell cytoplasm. Our results indicated that SS cells uniformly possessed the SYT-SSX fusion genes and expressed their transcripts. Furthermore, our results were thought to support monoclonal origin of epithelial and spindle cell components of biphasic SSs. Thus, specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18) is likely to be an early event in the development of SSs, and the expression of SYT-SSX fusion gene products is thought to be crucial for the tumorigenesis of SSs.",M1
15725802,"Primary intrathoracic synovial sarcoma: a clinicopathologic study of 40 t(X;18)-positive cases from the French Sarcoma Group and the Mesopath Group.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), an aggressive neoplasm accounting for up to 14% of soft tissue sarcomas, was recently recognized as a primary tumor in the lung and pleura. SS is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(SYT-SSX) found in more than 95% of the tumors. We report a cooperative study from the French Sarcoma Group and the Mesopath Group on 40 t(X;18)(SYT-SSX)-positive primary intrathoracic SS. There were 22 males and 18 females, whose age ranged from 16 to 79 years (median, 47 years). Neoplasms were mostly circumscribed and of large size (median, 7.5 cm; range, 2-16 cm). Thirty-nine tumors were monophasic SS, including 24 (60%) monophasic fibrous and 15 (37.5%) poorly differentiated cases, and one lesion was a biphasic SS. A larger proportion of poorly differentiated tumors were observed among intrathoracic SS as compared with soft tissue SS. Immunohistochemically, 90% of the cases reacted with at least one epithelial marker. CD34 was focally expressed in 3 cases. SYT-SSX1 fusion transcripts were detected in 22 cases (56.4%) and SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts in 17 cases. Median and 5-year disease-specific survival in 33 patients was 50 months and 31.6%. Median and 5-year disease-free survival was 24 months and 20.9%. Patient sex, age, tumor size, histologic subtype, grade, and SYS-SSX fusion type had no significant impact on outcome. In conclusion, intrathoracic SS are rare but aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. In this unusual location, the detection of SYT-SSX fusion transcripts is a valuable diagnostic adjunct.",M1
16007199,"Therapeutic potential of antibodies against FZD 10, a cell-surface protein, for synovial sarcomas.Genome-wide expression profiling revealed overexpression of the gene encoding frizzled homologue 10 (FZD 10), a cell-surface receptor for molecules in the Wnt pathway, as a potential contributor to synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>). Northern blotting and immunohistochemical staining confirmed that expression levels of FZD 10 were very high in nearly all SS tumors and cell lines examined but absent in most normal organs or in some cancers arising in other tissues. Treatment of human SS cells with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to FZD 10 decreased the amount of its product and suppressed growth of SS cells. Moreover, a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing the extracellular domain (ECD) of FZD 10 was markedly effective in mediating ADCC against FZD 10-overexpressing synovial sarcoma cells in vitro. Injection of the antibody into SS xenografts in nude mice attenuated tumor growth, and TUNEL assays revealed clusters of apoptotic cells in antibody-treated xenografts. Taken together, these findings suggest that a humanized antibody against FZD 10 might be a promising treatment for patients with tumors that overexpress FZD 10; minimal or no adverse reactions would be expected because FZD 10 protein is not abundant in vital organs.",M1
16152617,"Gene expression profiles relate to SS18/SSX fusion type in synovial sarcoma.We applied 27k spotted cDNA microarray slides to assess gene expression profiles in 26 samples from 24 patients with synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>). The data were analyzed in relation to histopathologic type, cytogenetic aberrations, gene fusion type and development of distant metastases. Supervised analysis based on gene fusion type in 12 SS with SS18/SSX1 and 9 with SS18/SSX2 revealed significant differences in gene expression profiles. Among the discriminators were several genes that have previously been found to be upregulated in SS, including AXL, ZIC2, SPAG7, AGRN, FOXC1, NCAM1 and multiple metallothioneins. Histopathology and degree of cytogenetic complexity did not significantly influence expression, whereas a genetic signature that related to development of metastases could be discerned, albeit with a high false-positive rate. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate differentially expressed genes for the 2 major gene fusion variants in SS, SS18/SSX1 and SS18/SSX2, and thereby suggest that these result in different downstream effects.",M1
15800948,"Ewing tumours and synovial sarcomas have critical features of karyotype evolution in common with epithelial tumours.We have analysed the accumulated cytogenetic data on karyotypic evolution in Ewing tumours (ET) and synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>). Both tumour types frequently show balanced translocations, t(11;22) and t(X;18), respectively, that result in specific fusion genes. The analyses revealed +8, +12, +1q, and 16q- as important secondary changes to t(11;22) in ET and the imbalances showed a distinct temporal order. By principal component analysis, one major karyotypic pathway dominated by gains and one minor dominated by losses were identified. The kartyotypic evolution pattern in SS was less distinct. Both ET and SS showed a power law distribution of the number of acquired aberrations, which in both tumour types conformed to a distribution with an exponent equal to 1. Similar distributions are frequently found in epithelial tumours. ET and SS differ in this respect from other malignancies with balanced translocations resulting in fusion genes, which typically show a power law distribution of the number of acquired aberrations with exponents close to 2. This suggests that chromosome changes in ET and SS may develop through mechanisms more similar to those in epithelial tumours lacking recurrent balanced rearrangements than in haematological malignancies characterised by balanced translocations leading to fusion genes.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 165 patients with SS (141 with localized disease at diagnosis) were studied retrospectively. The following parameters were examined for their potential prognostic value: age at diagnosis, sex, tumor site (extremities v proximal/truncal), size, histology, mitotic count, necrosis, histologic grade (Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer system), stage (1997 tumor-node-metastasis system classification), surgical margin status (assessed histologically), and fusion type (SYT-SSX1 v SYT-SSX2). Median follow-up time was 37 months (range, 2 to 302 months). RESULTS: Among those patients with localized disease at diagnosis, median and 5-year disease-specific survivals (DSS) for the SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 subgroups were 126 months and 67.4% versus 82 months and 63.2%, respectively (P = .12). Median and 5-year metastasis-free survivals (MFS) were 84 months and 54.2% for SYT-SSX1 versus 50 months and 47.6% for SYT-SSX2 (P = .76). Univariate analyses showed that high histologic grade (grade 3), high mitotic count (&gt;/= 10 mitoses/10 high-power fields), stage III disease, size greater than 7 cm, tumor necrosis, and presence of areas of poorly differentiated morphology were significant adverse prognostic factors for DSS and MFS, whereas SYT-SSX fusion type, tumor histology (biphasic v monophasic), and patient sex were not. Age greater than 35 years adversely affected DSS but not MFS. In multivariate analyses, histologic grade was the most significant prognostic factor for both DSS and MFS. CONCLUSION: For patients with localized SS, histologic grade but not SYT-SSX fusion type is a strong predictor of survival.",M1
15686440,"Clinical outcome of a novel photodynamic therapy technique using acridine orange for synovial sarcomas.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is one of common malignant soft-tissue tumors and is encountered most commonly in children and young adults. It frequently involves or invades major neurovascular structures and bones, and its local recurrence rate after simple resection has been reported to be as high as up to 80%. Because major nerves and vessels, as well as an adequate amount of bone, must be preserved to restore excellent limb function in cases of SS, a surgical technique entailing a low risk of local recurrence is needed. Based on the findings of recent experimental studies conducted by us using a mouse osteosarcoma model, we developed a novel therapeutic technique for SS, consisting of reduction surgery followed by photodynamic therapy using acridine orange (AO-PDT), with or without X-ray irradiation at 5 Gy. A preliminary study revealed that low-dose X-rays also excite AO like photons. After an initial study on cell cultures, this novel technique was applied to six cases of SS. A follow-up of the subjects to determine the clinical outcome revealed that none of the cases treated by AO-PDT, including the four cases treated by additional 5 Gy irradiation and the two cases not receiving any radiation, showed any evidence of recurrence or local/systemic complications during the follow-up period of 19-51 months after the surgery. Therefore, we believe that AO-PDT with 5 Gy irradiation may be an excellent novel therapeutic modality with reduction surgery to salvage excellent limb function in SS involving major nerves and vessels or bones.",M1
15905690,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the detection of t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) in a synovial sarcoma tissue microarray using a breakapart-style probe.Synovial sarcomas (<e>SSs</e>) account for 5% of soft tissue tumors and carry a balanced translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), detectable in over 90% of cases. This translocation brings together portions of two genes: SYT and SSX. Detecting interruption of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 would be useful as a diagnostic tool. We describe a scoring method to detect disruption of SYT with breakapart probe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the application of this method for identification of SS within a sarcoma tissue microarray. After optimization, SYT disruption was identified in 22 of 23 (96%) of known SS tumor samples but was not in 23 of 23 (100%) of non-SS sarcoma samples. Ten of 11 (91%) blinded test SS tumor samples were also correctly identified. For comparison, commercially available FISH and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) probes were tested. The commercial FISH probes identified SYT disruption in 81% of the SS tumor samples but in none of the non-SS samples. The CISH probes produced signals too weak to interpret. The use of breakapart FISH probes is a relatively quick procedure for detection of synovial sarcoma translocations and can be applied to archival specimens in tissue microarrays.",M1
15270432,"Monophasic synovial sarcoma of hypopharynx: case report and review of the literature.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm usually involving the lower limbs of young adults. Localization in head-neck district is rare. Histologically, these are characterised by a biphasic or monophasic variant, the latter being more rare and difficult to identify. Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis. Cytogenetics also play an important role since both the monophasic and the biphasic forms are characterised by a reciprocal translocation (x;18) (p 11.2;q 11.2). Treatment options include an aggressive surgical approach and radiotherapy, whereas the role of chemotherapy remains to be defined. The case is described of monophasic synovial sarcoma located in the hypopharynx and a review is made of the literature concerning this rare neoplasm.",M1
15547697,"Vasculogenic mimicry is associated with poor survival in patients with mesothelial sarcomas and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.Increased vasculogenesis must occur for tumors to develop and be maintained. Normally, vascular networks are composed of tube structures lined with endothelial cells. However, the vascular networks that form around some highly aggressive cancers possess a distinct tubular structure, resulting from a process called vasculogenic mimicry (VM) that does not have endothelial cells. In these tubes, the tumor cells function as endothelial cells. VM has been found in several different types of cancers such as melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. We hypothesized that it also plays a role in the development and metastasis of sarcomas, which are typically aggressive tumors. We used immunohistochemical analyses and electron microscopy to identify VM channels in 81 synovial sarcomas (<e>SSs</e>), 37 mesothelial sarcomas (MSs), 69 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARs), and 190 melanomas, which were used as a comparison group. The presence of red blood cells in the vessels was also used as a criterion for VM. Because VM is generally believed to be associated with aggressive cancers, we tested whether the presence of VM channel correlated with patient survival. We detected VM channels in 11 of 81 SSs (13.6%), 10 of 37 MSs (27.0%), 13 of 69 ARs (18.8%), and 10 of 190 melanomas (5.3%). The VM channels were not distributed uniformly in the tumor tissues but appeared in patches. In addition, VM channels were most frequently observed in the boundary regions between the tumor and adjacent normal tissues. The tumor cells around the VM tubes frequently stained positive for collagen IV and CD31 and were also PAS-positive. In contrast, tumors that lack VM channels generally also lack these markers. Our studies of the correlation of VM with patient survival also showed that VM correlated with shorter survival in patients with MS (P=0.03), AR (P=0.03), and melanoma (P=0.04), but not with SS (P=0.76). Our studies demonstrated that VM channels are a clinically important phenotype in sarcomas and melanomas. Our findings also suggested that a subpopulation of tumor cells possess features of both endothelial cells that line the vessels and mesenchymal cells that secrete the extracellular matrix required for the vascular infrastructure.",M1
15500711,"[Diagnostic significance and clinical application of specific chimeric genes in soft tissue sarcomas by RT-PCR using paraffin-embedded tissues: a study of 103 specimens]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of the chimeric genes resulting from the specific chromosomal translocations in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and its diagnostic significance for STS. METHODS: The variety of fusion transcripts were detected in 103 cases of STS, including 30 cases of synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), 15 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 25 cases of Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET), 12 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), 14 cases of aveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), 3 cases of leiomyosarcoma (LMS), 2 cases of malignant fibrous histocytoma (MFH), and 2 cases of fibrosarcoma (FS); and 20 cases of control tumors by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. RESULTS: Of the 34 cases of SS 28 (93.3%) expressed SSX-SYT chimeric transcripts (14 were positive for SYT-SSX1, 9 for SYT-SSX2). Four of the six cases of alveolar RMS had a PAX3/PAX7-FKHR fusion transcript. None of the 9 cases of embryonic and polymorphic RMS expressed PAX3/PAX7-FKHR. Of the 25 cases of ES/pPNET, 19 were positive for EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript and 1 for EWS-ERG fusion transcript. COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcript was expressed in 8 of the 12 cases (66.7%) of DFSP. Of the fourteen cases of ASPS, ten expressed ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcript. None of the 3 cases of LMS, 2 cases of MFH, 2 cases of FS, and 20 control cases contained any of the fusion transcript. CONCLUSION: Chimeric gene transcript resulting from specific chromosomal translocations is a reliable index for the molecular diagnosis of STS and RT-PCR assay for detection of specific fusion gene provides a useful tool for confirmation of the diagnosis of STS in diagnostically difficult cases and in retrospective studies.",M1
15467754,"E-cadherin mutation and Snail overexpression as alternative mechanisms of E-cadherin inactivation in synovial sarcoma.We have recently reported frequent E-cadherin gene mutations in synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), suggesting mutational inactivation of E-cadherin as a potential mechanism of spindle cell morphology in SS, a spindle cell sarcoma that shows areas of glandular epithelial differentiaton in some cases (biphasic SS) and only pure spindle cell morphology in most cases (monophasic SS). However, the mechanism of downregulation of E-cadherin in SS remains unknown. To further address this issue, we analysed the mechanisms of E-cadherin silencing in 40 SS. Genetic and epigenetic changes in the E-cadherin gene, and the expression level of its transcriptional repressor Snail were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), methylation-specific PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Expression of E-cadherin was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We also examined ELF3, a transcription factor associated with epithelial differentiation in SS in a previous cDNA microarray, by RT-PCR. E-cadherin and ELF3 transcripts were detected, respectively, in 27/40 (67.5%) and in 25/40 (62.5%) of SS, and these epithelial-related genes were almost always coexpressed. Hypermethylation of the promoter of the E-cadherin gene was detected in five cases (12.5%) in SS; however, E-cadherin was silenced at mRNA level in only one of the five cases. E-cadherin missense mutations were observed in five cases (12.5%) of SS. In SS, all five cases with E-cadherin missense mutations had the SYT-SSX1 fusion and were monophasic tumors, suggesting a relationship between the SYT-SSX fusion type and E-cadherin missense mutation (P=0.07). E-cadherin mRNA expression in SS was associated with reduced Snail expression level (P=0.03). E-cadherin membranous expression was observed in 14/40 (35.0%) of SS, and was also correlated with SYT-SSX1 fusion type and biphasic histology. ELF3 was confirmed to be more highly expressed in biphasic than monophasic SS by real-time quantitative PCR. These results suggest that in SS the loss of E-cadherin expression occurs either by Snail trans-repression or by inactivating mutations. Thus, E-cadherin downregulation is associated with the loss or absence of glandular epithelial differentiation in certain SS.",M1
15077175,"Identification of PDZK4, a novel human gene with PDZ domains, that is upregulated in synovial sarcomas.In an earlier study designed to investigate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in synovial sarcomas (<e>SSs</e>), we applied a cDNA microarray to detect human genes with significantly increased expression in SS cells. Among the genes selected in this way, we identified a novel transcript, subsequently designated PDZK4 (PDZ domain-containing 4), that was specifically upregulated in all of the 13 SS cases we examined. On Northern blots of normal human tissues, the PDZK4 transcript was expressed only in fetal brain. Immunocytochemical staining of transfected COS7 cells showed that the PDZK4 gene product localized mainly under the plasma membrane. Treatment of human SS cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the expression of PDZK4 and resulted in the suppression of tumor-cell growth. Induction of exogenous PDZK4 expression promoted growth of T98G and COS7 cells in which no endogenous expression of PDZK4 was observed. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that inappropriate expression of PDZK4 might play an important role in the proliferation of SS cells and that the gene might be a suitable molecular target for designing of novel drugs to treat SS patients.",M1
15350633,"Are there geographical differences in the frequency of SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 chimeric transcripts in synovial sarcoma?Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by the t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) chromosomal translocation, which results in generating either SYT-SSX1, SYT-SSX2 or, infrequently, SYT-SSX4 fusion gene. The ratio of SYT-SSX1:SYT-SSX2 fusions is close to 2:1 in the majority of studies, and SYT-SSX2 fusion has been only rarely observed in biphasic SS. In the present study, we compared two series of patients with SS, Slovenian (37 cases) and Dutch (14 cases), with respect to clinical, pathological and molecular findings. The two groups did not differ with regard to clinicopathological features. Whereas the frequency of different SYT-SSX fusions in the Dutch group was similar to that reported in the literature, we found an unexpectedly high number of tumors with SYT-SSX2 fusion in the Slovenian group. The ratio of SYT-SSX1:SYT-SSX2 fusion was 7:18 for monophasic and 2:7 for biphasic tumors in the Slovenian group. This distribution differs significantly from that observed in the Dutch group in the present study (P = 0.041) as well as from data reported in the recent large multi-institutional study on 243 patients (P = 0.0001). Our findings indicate possible geographical differences in the frequency of two SYT-SSX fusion transcripts in patients with synovial sarcoma.",M1
15338724,"Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>): new perspectives supported by modern technology.Based upon the experience of 256 cases of synovial sarcoma (SS), the present review analyzes structural, biological and molecular pathology of this poorly known sarcoma. The histology displays a multiphenotype with two major components: biphasic and monophasic SS. In addition, a number of variants have been described: undifferentiated Ewing's like, myoxid and predominantly epithelial (monophasic epithelial sarcoma). Microcalcifications and squamous metaplasia are often seen in the tumor. Immunohistochemistry with EMA and cytokeratin in the epithelial or epithelioid component is diagnostic for SS together with vimentin positivity in the spindle cells. Several other epitopes are also expressed (CD99, CD56, C-MET, HGF/SF, CD44). The ultrastructure confirms the variegated pattern of the neoplasm demonstrating the epithelial component and the epithelioid or spindle cell type closely associated with each other. Transition of epithelial cells to epithelioid and spindle-like mesenchymal component is seen. Nude-mice xenografts and cell lines after in vitro culture confirm heterogeneity of this sarcoma. Molecular histology of the SS has provided high utility not only for their differential diagnosis due to a specific chromosomal translocation: t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) but also after cloning these breakpoints resulting in the fusion of two genes: SYT at 18q11 and SSX at Xp11. Further observations have lead to distinguish the existence of two related genes: SSX1 and SSX2, that provide a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic marker for SS. Moreover, clinical correlations have demonstrated that SYT-SSX1 leads to a poor clinical outcome while the fusion SYT-SSX2 provides survival advantages to the patients.",M1
15274077,"Synovial sarcoma: a retrospective analysis of 271 patients of all ages treated at a single institution.BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is subject to debate, and different strategies have been used for pediatric and adult patients. The current retrospective analysis examined a large group of patients of all ages who were treated at a single institution over a 30-year period. METHODS: The study included 271 patients who ranged in age from 5 years to 87 years; 255 had localized disease, which was macroscopically resected in 215 cases and deemed unresectable at diagnosis in 40 cases. Chemotherapy was administered to 41% of patients, corresponding to 76% of patients age or 16 years and &lt; 20% of older patients; 28% of patients with macroscopically resected disease received chemotherapy on an adjuvant basis. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival rate for the study cohort as a whole was 37%, although this rate varied with age (66%, 40%, and 31% for patients age &lt; or = 16 years, 17-30 years, and &gt; 30 years, respectively). Chemotherapy was used more commonly for children than for adults. Among patients with surgically resected disease, the 5-year metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was 60% for those who were treated with chemotherapy and 48% for those who were not; the benefit associated with chemotherapy use appeared to be greatest for patients age &gt; or = 17 years who had tumors measuring &gt; 5 cm (MFS, 47% [chemotherapy] vs. 27% [no chemotherapy]). In the subgroup of patients with measurable disease, the rate of tumor response to chemotherapy was approximately 48%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the authors await more convincing proof of the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of adult soft tissue sarcoma, they recommend that patients with high-risk SS (tumor size &gt; 5 cm) be the first to be considered for this type of treatment.",M1
14669292,"Should molecular testing be required for diagnosing synovial sarcoma? A prospective study of 204 cases.BACKGROUND: The t(X;18) translocation is a specific marker of synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>). Detection of SYT-SSX transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was tested on preselected specimens of well-established histologic types, but to our knowledge, the diagnostic utility of molecular assays on a series of potential SS in comparison with conventional tools has never been reported. METHODS: Two hundred four consecutive cases of potential SS submitted for a second opinion were studied prospectively. On the basis of clinical context, histologic aspect, and immunohistochemical profile, the tumors were divided into three categories: 1) diagnosis of SS certain, when the only possible diagnosis was SS; 2) diagnosis of SS probable, when SS was the first diagnosis contemplated, but a differential diagnostic issue was raised by other tumors; 3) diagnosis of SS possible, when the diagnosis of SS was not the first diagnosis considered. Detection of SYT-SSX transcripts was performed using real-time PCR from fixed, embedded tissue as a systematic test. RESULTS: Sufficient RNA samples were recovered for PCR from 177 specimens (87%). One hundred four specimens (51%) were positive for SYT-SSX transcripts. Tumor sites of SS included the extremities (n = 57), lung (n = 13), trunk wall (n = 12), head and neck (n = 6), and other sites (n = 16). There were 61 monophasic, 22 poorly differentiated, 17 biphasic, and 4 predominantly epithelial SS. For 58 tumor specimens (29%), diagnosis of SS was certain before molecular testing; 49 (84.5%) of these 58 contained SYT-SSX transcripts. For 39 tumor specimens (19%), diagnosis of SS was probable; 29 (74.4%) of these 39 contained SYT-SSX transcripts. For 107 tumor specimens (52%), diagnosis of SS was only possible and strongly challenged by another histologic type. The issue consisted mainly of making the distinction between an SS and a poorly differentiated spindle cell sarcoma (n = 49), a poorly differentiated round cell sarcoma (n = 34), a carcinoma (n = 11), a myoepithelioma (n = 8), or an epithelioid fibrosarcoma (n = 5).Twenty-six tumor specimens (24.3%) contained SYT-SSX transcripts-10, 7, 5, 3, and 1 in the spindle cell tumor, round cell tumor, carcinomalike tumor, myoepitheliomalike tumor, and epithelioid-fibrosarcoma-like tumor categories, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular testing was not required if the diagnosis of SS was certain or probable on the basis of clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation. However, it proved to be very helpful or necessary when the diagnosis of SS was only possible and was challenged by other tumor types, mainly other spindle cell sarcomas, round cell sarcomas, carcinomas, myoepitheliomas, and epithelioid fibrosarcomas.",M1
15257548,"Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma: a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular study of 11 cases.Primary synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) of the lung is rare and may create diagnostic challenges. We reviewed 11 cases of pulmonary SS (PSS) confirmed by the presence of a tumor-specific SYT-SSX fusion gene to verify their clinicopathologic features including immunohistochemical and genetical profiles. The tumors occurred in 4 men and 7 women (age 29 to 81 years; mean age, 58; median age, 50), and ranged in size from 2 to 15.5 cm (mean, 9 cm). Of the 11 tumors, 10 were a monophasic fibrous type and 1 was a poorly differentiated type. Mitotic rate ranged from 8 to 43 per 10 high-power fields. All cases showed at least focal immunohistochemical positivity for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2 and/or epithelial membrane antigen. High proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index (&gt;20%) was found in 8 of 10 cases (80%). Eight (90%) of 9 cases were negative for E-cadherin, and 1 case (10%) exhibited reduced expression of the molecule. The aberrant expression of beta-catenin within cytoplasm and/or nuclei was observed in 6 of 9 (67%) cases. SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 fusion gene transcripts were detected in 9 and 2 cases, respectively. In 10 patients with follow-up, 3 (30%) had local recurrences, and 4 (40%) developed distant metastases. Five (50%) patients died of the tumor 1 to 9 years after surgery, and 5 (50%) were alive and disease-free in the period ranging from 3 months to 5.5 years. In conclusion, PSS tends to occur in older patients and shows an aggressive behavior probably due to its anatomical location and large tumor often resulting in incomplete resection and high proliferative activity.",M1
15163010,"A poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma (SYT/SSX1) expresses neuroectodermal markers: a xenografts and in vitro culture study.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a neoplasm that poses diagnostic problems, due to its histologic heterogeneity. The poorly differentiated variant, in particular, may be histologically indistinguishable from other small round cell tumors. Detection of the synovial sarcoma-associated t(X;18) or SYT-SSX fusion transcripts may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of SS in difficult cases. Most of SS carry a t(X;18) in about one third of cases as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. We evaluated a case of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma and their derived tumors in nude mice xenografts and cell cultures. We used a panel of antibodies (including those to intermediate filament, nerve-sheath associated markers, and neuronal and neuroectodermal related antigens) to better establish the immunophenotype, supported by the ultrastructural evaluation. The tumor exhibited the distinctive cytogenetic abnormality t(X;18), together with a der(1)t(1;22)(p36;q12). Present results show that this poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma not only expresses conventional biologic and genetical markers for SS but also neuroectodermal features when transplanted into nude mice and cultured in vitro.",M1
15140553,"SYT-SSX fusion genes in synovial sarcoma of the thorax.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by a chromosomal translocation resulting in the expression of an SYT-SSX chimeric transcript, usually SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2. Synovial sarcoma typically originates in the limbs, and its location in the thorax is rare. Synovial sarcomas are usually classified into three histologic subtypes: biphasic, monophasic and poorly differentiated tumors. The detection of the characteristic chimeric transcript often contributes to a histopathological diagnosis, especially when the tumor arises in an unusual location. Previous studies have shown that SYT-SSX1 is the most common SYT-SSX fusion transcript in biphasic synovial sarcomas of the limbs. Here, we report two cases of synovial sarcoma originating in the thorax. The presence of SYT-SSX2 chimeric transcripts was confirmed by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a direct sequencing analysis in both cases. The tumor in case 1 originated from the pericardium, which is an exceedingly rare site for primary synovial sarcoma; only three other cases of synovial sarcoma originating in the pericardium have been previously reported. Case 2 exhibited a biphasic synovial sarcoma of the mediastinum containing an SYT-SSX2 fusion transcript, which is a rare fusion type in biphasic synovial sarcomas of the limbs. We reviewed previous reports of thoracic synovial sarcomas containing an analysis of the SYT-SSX fusion transcript and found that case 2 in the present study was the first description of a biphasic synovial sarcoma of the thorax with an SYT-SSX2 fusion transcript. However, the number of reported cases was not sufficient to conclude that SYT-SSX2 fusion in biphasic synovial sarcoma of the thorax is, indeed, rare. Further genetic analysis is needed to fully understand the biological and clinical features of synovial sarcoma originating in the thorax.",M1
12552937,"Molecular analyses, morphology and immunohistochemistry together differentiate pleural synovial sarcomas from mesotheliomas: clinical implications.BACKGROUND: Only recently pleural synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) have been definitively identified because of the presence of a characteristic X;18 translocation. SS are sarcomatoid or biphasic malignancies morphologically almost indistinguishable from sarcomatoid or biphasic malignant mesotheliomas (MM). PATIENT AND METHODS: We demonstrated a primary pleural biphasic SS in a patient referred to us has having a biphasic MM. RESULTS: Histology showed a spindle cell tumor with focal epithelioid differentiation, microcalcifications, and a hemangiopericytomatous vascular pattern. Ultrastructurally, the epithelioid tumor cells had few blunt microvilli and occasional intercellular junctions. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells were positive for BCL-2, CD99, CD56, and focally for BerEp4, Pancytokeratin and cytokeratin 5/6. These findings suggested the possibility of SS rather than MM. Detection of the t(X:18) translocation using RT-PCR, Southern blot, and DNA sequencing definitively confirmed the diagnosis of SS. CONCLUSION: The differential between pleural SS and MM requires a high degree of suspicion and molecular analyses because morphology (histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy) is insufficient to definitively distinguish between these two malignancies. This differential is critical because patients with pleural SS can be susceptible to chemotherapy, and accordingly are treated, while patients with sarcomatoid MM are resistant to chemotherapy and accordingly are not treated.",M1
15069540,"PTEN and other tumor suppressor gene mutations as secondary genetic alterations in synovial sarcoma.Synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) consistently show a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(X;18)(p11;q11), which usually leads to the formation of 2 chimeric fusion transcripts, SYT-SSX1 and -SSX2. A recent multi-institutional retrospective study revealed that the SYT-SSX fusion type emerged as the only independent significant factor for overall survival in cases of SS. The aims of this study were; i). to investigate the frequency of PTEN gene alteration, ii). to evaluate whether the mutation status in various tumor suppressor genes (TSG) is responsible for the clinical and histologic heterogeneity in SS. Forty-nine cases of SS were examined for the presence of PTEN gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction - single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by DNA direct sequencing. The obtained data was combined with those of previously reported TSG mutations such as p53, adenomatous polyposis coli, and E-cadherin genes. Follow-up was available for 44 patients, and survival analysis was performed according to the mutation status of these TSG. PTEN mutations were detected in 7 cases (14.3%), and all of these were monophasic tumors. More than half of the mutations detected were located in exon 9, which has been shown to play a less important role in PTEN functioning, and the PTEN mutation was not associated with patients' prognosis. Mutations in these TSG other than silent mutations were detected in 20 out of 49 cases (40.8%), although the mutation status in TSG was not associated with overall survival rate in patients with SS. Secondary genetic alterations in these TSG seem to have a less important prognostic impact on patients with SS.",M1
14871970,"Expression of ligand-activated KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta tyrosine kinase receptors in synovial sarcoma.PURPOSE: The use of tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors is increasingly becoming a valuable therapeutic alternative in tumors carrying activated tyrosine kinase receptors. In a previous study, we described a coexpression of KIT and stem cell factor (SCF) mRNA in Synovial sarcomas, (<e>SS</e>) and in a limited number of cases, we demonstrated the presence of an activated receptor. Here, in a wider number of cases, we investigated the expression level and phosphorylation status of two structurally related tyrosine kinase receptors, KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), at the light of their role as possible targets of tyrosine kinase receptors inhibitor molecules. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-three SS cases were analyzed for KIT and PDGFRbeta expression/activation by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting experiments. The cognate ligands, SCF and PDGFB, were detected by reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: KIT was observed in 48 and 41% (45% total) whereas PDGFRbeta in 54 and 33% (45% total) of monophasic and biphasic SS cases, respectively. With respect to the fusion transcript type SYTSSX1 and SYTSSX2, KIT was more expressed in SYTSSX1 carrying cases (48 versus 38%), whereas PDGFRbeta resulted more frequently expressed in SYTSSX2 ones (54 versus 37%). When expressed, the receptors were phosphorylated. Their ligands were detected in all of the activated cases. CONCLUSIONS: About 70% of the cases express one of the two activated tyrosine kinase receptors with a mutually exclusive expression trend. Coexpression is not frequent and seems to be restricted to monophasic subtype. These data indicate that a consistent fraction of this tumor type could represent a good candidate for kinase inhibitor molecules effective on KIT and PDGFRbeta where their activation is sustained by an autocrine loop.",M1
14696140,"Monophasic synovial sarcoma: a cytologic spectrum.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a high-grade sarcoma that can be diagnosed in cytology with certainty only when it presents with a biphasic pattern. Monophasic SS (MSS), however, is a diagnostic consideration when a uniform spindle cell population is present. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a series of cytologic cases of MSS and its cytologic presentation. Twenty-one FNAs of histologically confirmed MSS were reviewed. Specimens consisted of tissue fragments and single cells containing scant granular cytoplasm, medium-sized nuclei, and coarse chromatin. A monotonous spindle pattern with comma-shaped nuclei was present in 5 cases. Sixteen cases contained oval and spindled nuclei. Eight of these specimens contained round nuclei, and 5 of these cases showed prominent nucleoli and cohesive clusters, reminiscent of biphasic SS. We conclude that a spectrum of cytologic findings can be seen in MSS, including a secondary population of cells with morphology usually typical of biphasic SS.",M1
12874758,"Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis of HER2/neu oncogene in synovial sarcoma.Amplification and/or overexpression of HER2/neu have been documented in many types of epithelial tumor and recently has been reported in sarcomas, particularly in osteosarcomas. But the role of HER2/neu alterations in soft tissue tumors remains poorly understood. Thus the present study investigates the expression of HER2/neu in 13 patients with synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). In this study, HER2/neu mRNA levels were measured in frozen tissue samples using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay; protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-HER2/neu polyclonal antibody. Six normal skeletal muscle specimens were used to establish basal levels of HER2/neu mRNA. HER2/neu transcripts were detected in all normal tissues and SSs. Four of 13 sarcomas (31%) demonstrated HER2/neu mRNA levels above the mean value, whereas 3 tumors (23%) displayed HER2/neu protein overexpression. Both membranous and cytoplasmic patterns of immunostaining were observed, and a strong correlation was found between protein expression and mRNA level (P = 0.01). Increased HER2/neu mRNA levels were significantly associated with a lower risk of developing recurrences (P = 0.02). Moreover, none of the patients with HER2/neu overexpression developed metastasis. Our data demonstrate that HER2/neu is expressed in SSs and that both membrane and cytoplasmic HER2/neu expression correlate with mRNA levels. Our results show that the presence of increased levels of HER2/neu in SSs is associated with a more favorable clinical course. Further studies are needed to assess the role of this oncogene in SSs and to evaluate the application of inhibitory humanized monoclonal antibodies in the treatment regimens for this malignancy.",M1
12707378,"Novel fluorescent ligase detection reaction and flow cytometric analysis of SYT-SSX fusions in synovial sarcoma.Synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) are characterized by the t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation and its resultant fusion gene, SYT-SSX. Two homologues of the SSX gene (ie, SSX1 and SSX2) are involved in the vast majority of SS and the SYT-SSX1 type of fusion has been associated with inferior clinical outcome. Thus, detection of the presence and type of SYT-SSX fusion is critical for diagnosis and prognosis in SS. Identification of SYT-SSX fusion type is typically accomplished by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by a post-PCR analytic method. As mRNA nucleotide sequences of the SSX1 and SSX2 segments involved in the SYT-SSX fusion are nearly identical, post-PCR methods must be highly discriminatory. We describe a novel method to identify and differentiate these two chimeric transcripts using RT-PCR followed by fluorescent thermostable ligase detection reaction (f-LDR), microparticle bead capture and flow cytometric detection. Evaluation of this unique approach in 11 cases of SS without prior knowledge of SYT-SSX status, six cases of control sarcomas (CS) and three hematopoietic cell lines, revealed that the f-LDR technique was rapid, unambiguous, and highly specific. The f-LDR results were compared to XmnI enzyme digestion patterns and sequencing of PCR products, revealing a 100% concordance for all cases of SS with regards to SYT-SSX transcript type. In addition, there was a strong association of transcript type detected by f-LDR and morphological subclassification of SS, as previously reported. We conclude that this f-LDR method with flow-based detection is a robust approach to post-PCR detection of specific nucleotide sequences in SS and may be more broadly applicable in molecular oncology.",M1
12574853,"Primary synovial sarcoma of the kidney: a case report with literature review.We describe a case of primary renal synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) in a 48-year-old man. The patient presented with hematuria and was found to have a large tumor in his left kidney on computed tomography scan. Histology revealed a highly cellular spindle cell neoplasm with minimal pleomorphism. The major differential diagnoses included leiomyosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and SS. The presence of focal areas with a biphasic pattern, uniformly positive immunostain for bcl-2, focally positive immunostains for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin, and negative immunostains for CD-34, smooth muscle actin and S-100 established the diagnosis. This was subsequently confirmed by molecular testing for t(X;18) translocation. Since the existence of primary SS in the kidney was first suggested in 1999, to the best of our knowledge a total of 19 cases including the present case have been reported to date. Although primary renal SS is rare, these findings indicate that it should be included in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors of the kidney.",M1
12065783,"A novel type of SYT/SSX fusion: methodological and biological implications.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a rare soft-tissue tumor that affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in the fusion of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 with a SSX gene on chromosome X. In the majority of cases, SYT is fused to exon 5 of SSX1 (64%), SSX2 (36%), or, rarely, SSX4. A novel fusion transcript variant deriving from the fusion of SYT to exon 6 of SSX4 gene (SYT/SSX4v) was found coexpressed in one of the previously reported SYT/SSX4 cases. In the present investigation, we describe a new SS case that was previously shown to be negative for SYT/SSX1 and SYT/SSX2 expression by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. By redesigning and optimizing the RT-PCR protocol, we were able to detect SYT/SSX4v as the sole fusion transcript expressed in this tumor sample. This finding suggests that this novel fusion gene, which involves exon 6 of SSX only, is sufficient to keep the transforming function conferred by the SYT/SSX translocation of SS. In about 3% of morphologically, ultrastructurally, and immunohistochemically defined SS, the SYT/SSX fusion transcript is not detected using conventional RT-PCR. Here we demonstrate that optimization of the RT-PCR method is important for detecting different and unexpected SYT/SSX variants, which otherwise could be overlooked. Using nine cases of SS in which SYT/SSX fusion transcripts were not detected by conventional RT-PCR methods, we demonstrate the presence of SYT/SSX transcripts in two cases using the proposed RT-PCR approach. Applications of optimized RT-PCR can contribute to reduce false-negative SYT/SSX SS cases reported in literature.",M1

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a complex abnormal karyotype without evidence of the typical t(X;18)(p11;q11) associated with SS. Subsequent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed the presence of an SYT/SSX2 fusion transcript, confirming the presence of a cyptic t(X;18). In light of -X, -18 and marker chromosomes evident in the G-band karyotype, it was suspected that a cryptic chromosomal rearrangement involving the marker chromosomes would harbor an X;18 fusion. Multi-colored karytotyping (M-FISH) revealed a previously unrecognized t(X;18) and t(5;19) in the marker chromosomes as well as unrecognized ins(6;18) and t(16;20). The addition of M-FISH analysis in this case led to the identification of complex inter-chromosomal rearrangements, thus providing an accurate karyotype.",M1
12409719,"Monophasic fibrous and poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma: immunohistochemical reassessment of 60 t(X;18)(SYT-SSX)-positive cases.Diagnosing monophasic fibrous and poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) on morphology alone is often a source of problems for pathologists. SS bear the t(X;18)(p11.2,q11.2) translocation, which proved to be specific for this tumor type and is currently considered one of the most reliable diagnostic criteria. To evaluate the sensitivity of immunohistochemical techniques in diagnosing monophasic fibrous SS (MFSS) and poorly differentiated SS (PDSS), we examined 60 t(X;18)(SYT-SSX)-positive cases (47 MFSS and 13 PDSS) for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin KL1, epithelial membrane antigen, E-cadherin, CD34, S-100 protein, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon, CD99, bcl2, and C-kit (CD117) antibodies. Of the four epithelial markers tested, epithelial membrane antigen proved to be the most sensitive, reacting with 100% of MFSS and 92% of PDSS, followed by cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (70% of MFSS, 46% of PDSS), cytokeratin KL1 (49% of MFSS, 38% of PDSS), and E-cadherin (47% of MFSS, 54% of PDSS). A staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and/or E-cadherin was observed in 79% of MFSS and 69% of PDSS, and a staining for cytokeratin KL1 and/or E-cadherin was observed in 74% of MFSS and 62% of PDSS. S-100 protein was positive in 38% of MFSS and 23% of PDSS, and alpha-smooth muscle actin in 21% of MFSS and 8% of PDSS. Tumor cells were rarely positive for CD34 (6% of MFSS, 0% of PDSS) and desmin (2% of MFSS, 0% of PDSS). Most SS were strongly positive for bcl-2 (91% of MFSS, 92% of PDSS) and CD99 (91% of MFSS, 100% of PDSS). A weak and focal cytoplasmic reactivity for CD117 was observed in 11% of MFSS (only one case had a strong immunoreactivity) and 8% of PDSS. Staining with h-caldesmon was consistently negative. In conclusion, in keeping with literature data, our results show that reactivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and E-cadherin, in combination with CD34 negativity, are the most useful and sensitive markers for diagnosing monophasic fibrous and poorly differentiated t(X;18)-positive SS. They also support the fact that about one third of MFSS and one fourth of PDSS are positive for S-100 protein, a finding of diagnostic relevance when considering their distinction from other spindle to round cell sarcomas, especially malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.",M1
12940774,"Identification of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma: a comparison of clinicopathological and cytogenetic features with those of typical synovial sarcoma.AIMS: Poorly differentiated areas in synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) are known to be associated with a poorer prognosis. The aim of our study was to describe the morphological spectrum of poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas (PDSS) and refine the criteria for their recognition. METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinicopathological features of 28 PDSS were compared with those of 26 classic SS. Common cell types in PDSS included epithelioid, spindle and Ewing sarcoma-like small round cells. Unusual features included presence of desmoplastic small cell tumour-like areas and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma-like areas. The presence of necrosis (P = 0.002), a mitotic rate over 10/10 high-power fields (P &lt; 0.001), a haemangiopericytomatous vascular pattern (P &lt; 0.001) and vascular invasion (P = 0.003) were significantly associated with PDSS, while mast cells (P &lt; 0.001), calcification (P &lt; 0.001) and hyaline bands (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with classic SS. Poorly differentiated areas showed increased proliferative activity with Ki67. PDSS showed a tendency to be larger (P = 0.008) and to be located in proximal more than distal sites (P = 0.025). Three entirely poorly differentiated tumours were diagnosed by demonstration of the t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation. PDSS showed additional cytogenetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas show a spectrum of histological features, which may simulate other malignant neoplasms. The diagnosis of entirely poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas requires cytogenetic analysis.",M1

Although several cytologic studies of SS have been published, correlative studies of cytologic and corresponding histologic features are limited. To better define the cytological features of various SS forms, we reviewed the cytologic and the corresponding histologic material of 56 tumors from 36 patients. Classical patterns were defined as dispersed or small clusters of cells with bland chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, oval to spindle-shaped cytoplasm and branching tumor tissue fragments, vessel stalks, acinar structures in scant mucin background, seen in all 53 (94.7%) cellular cases. Epithelial, squamous, round cells, mast cells, necrosis, comma-like nuclei, marked nuclear atypia, secretory mucin, and rosette-like structures were also occasionally observed. Comparing the histological subtype we noted that epithelial cells and secretory mucin were restricted to biphasic SS, round cells to poorly differentiated SS, and comma-like nuclei to monophasic fibrous SS. We conclude that the classical pattern is highly suggestive of SS of all three monophasic, biphasic, or poorly differentiated subtypes. These characteristics, along with molecular genetic studies, may improve the cytologic diagnosis of SS.",M1

We adapted real-time qualitative RT-PCR to utilize dual-labeled, fluorogenic, TaqMan probes, which hybridize to targets that overlap the junction of the chimeric gene fusions in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). Assays were confirmed on cell lines and tissue samples; appropriate negative amplification assays were obtained when each tumor-specific probe and primer set was used on different neoplasms and cell lines that were not expected to harbor the specific translocations and chimeric gene fusions. Although our cases are few, we speculate that as more molecular variants of ARMS, SS, and DSRCT are discovered, clinical correlations based on precise molecular features will be required and fusion site specificity will be assured by the use of junction-based TaqMan probes.",M1

11078492,"Synovial sarcoma: a clinicopathologic, staging, and prognostic assessment.PURPOSE: Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a common soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a propensity for young adults and notable sensitivity to chemotherapy (CT). This study provides a current clinicopathologic, staging, and prognostic assessment for SS. The problems with the current American Joint Committee for Cancer (AJCC) Staging System in relation to SS are discussed. METHODS: Review of a prospective database supplemented by retrospective data. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were assessed; median age was 30 years and median follow-up was 52 months. Overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 57%. Size trend, but not a cutoff of less than 5 cm versus &gt; or = 5 cm, was a prognostic indicator (P &lt;.001). The current AJCC/International Union Against Cancer Staging System differentiated prognosis less well than the recently proposed Royal Marsden Hospital Staging System. Age greater than 20 years at diagnosis implied worse prognosis. A local recurrence event was associated with a worse survival (P &lt;.001). Therapeutic CT was administered to 55 patients. Eleven of 19 patients had an objective response to a combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin. Four cases had complete response after CT. Twenty-one patients had pulmonary metastasectomy, with an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 23%. CONCLUSION: SS tends to affect young people. In this subtype of STS, size trend is the most significant influence on stage and hence survival; however, smaller SSs have an unexpectedly poor prognosis. Adequate local control may affect survival. SS is often chemosensitive, and given its poor prognosis, multicenter trials of adjuvant therapy are warranted.",M1

METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of 38 cases of SS and 40 cases of control tumors (including spindle cell sarcoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma) were retrived from archival materials. SYT-SSX fusion transcripts were detected in all samples by RT-PCR. House-keeping gene Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD) was used to detect the quality of mRNA. RESULTS: PBGD mRNA was detected in 64 of the 78 tumor cases (82.1%). SYT-SSX fusion transcripts was detected in 33 of the 38 synovial sarcoma specimens. No SYT-SSX mRNA expression was found in control tumors. SYT-SSX mRNA expression rate reached 89.2% (33/37) in synovial sarcomas after exclusion of 1 case which was negative for both SYT-SSX and PBGD. In 33 SYT-SSX positive synovial sarcomas, 22 had SYT-SSX1 and 6 had SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts. In 5 cases, the fusion type could not be distinguished. There was an association between SYT-SSX fusion type and histologic subtype. All 10 biphasic synovial sarcoma cases had the SYT-SSX1 fusion, whereas 12 of 18 monophasic synovial sarcoma had the SYT-SSX1 and 6 had the SYT-SSX2 fusion gene (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Detection of SYT-SSX fusion gene in paraffin-embedded tissues was found to be a sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. (2) There was an association between SYT-SSX fusion type and histologic subtype.SYT-SSX2 fusion transcript could only be found in monophasic synovial sarcomas.",M1
11559563,"Antigenicity of fusion proteins from sarcoma-associated chromosomal translocations.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) are soft-tissue malignancies occurring primarily in adolescents and young adults. These tumors contain specific chromosomal translocations that fuse the 5' region of one gene with the 3' region of another, resulting in the formation of characteristic fusion proteins. These translocations are unique to tumor cells and may be required for persistence, thereby serving as targets for immunotherapy. It was hypothesized that the fusion breakpoint sequences associated with SS, CCS, and DSRCT can serve as tumor-specific neoantigens. To test this, peptides corresponding to the fusion breakpoints were designed and assessed for ability to bind to various class I HLA molecules. Two peptides derived from the SS breakpoint specifically bind the HLA-B7 antigen, and a 10-amino acid minimal epitope was identified for this interaction. Specific binding of a SS peptide and a CCS peptide to HLA-B27 molecule was also observed. Finally, a peptide designed from the DSRCT breakpoint specifically binds the HLA-A3 molecule, and a 9-amino acid optimal epitope was identified for this interaction. The physiological/immunological relevance of these peptide/MHC interactions was demonstrated by the induction of SS-specific CTLs from normal donor lymphocytes using in vitro stimulation with autologous, peptide-pulsed dendritic cells and by the ability of these CTLs to lyse human SS tumor cells endogenously expressing the full-length fusion protein. These results suggest that sequences in the fusion region of sarcoma-associated chimeras can bind class I HLA molecules and serve as neoantigens. These may be useful for the development of novel immunotherapies for sarcoma patients with appropriate HLA molecules and tumors bearing these translocations.",M1

PROCEDURE: We reviewed medical records of 42 children and adolescents with SS treated at our institution between 1966 and 1999 to determine treatment results and assess prognostic factors. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 7.8 years (range 0.2-22.4 years), 5-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 75.6% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 62-89.2%) and 87.7% (95% CI 77.3-98.1%) respectively. Eleven patients were dead and four others had progressed but were alive without evidence of disease after further therapy. IRS grouping and tumor invasiveness were found to be significant prognostic indicators (P &lt; 0.01 and = 0.02, respectively). Patients with initial gross total resection (IRS I and II) and non-invasive tumors (T1) were most likely to have prolonged PFS and OS. Patients with small tumors (&lt; 5 cm) (P = 0.09) or with monophasic histology (P = 0.14) had better PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a complete resection or gross total resection with microscopic residual disease is vital for survival of patients with localized SS. Patients with localized disease who received radiotherapy had improved local control. Chemotherapy did not seem to impact PFS or OS. Future large multi-institutional trials are needed to address whether post-operative chemotherapy is necessary for patients with localized, surgically removed tumors, whether radiotherapy is necessary for patients with completely resected tumors, and to ascertain the order of importance of all the candidate prognostic markers.

Although recent molecular analysis has disclosed involvement of a specific chromosomal translocation in the pathogenesis of SS, its genetic features remain largely unclear. In the work reported here we examined genome-wide gene expression profiles of 13 SS cases and 34 other spindle-cell sarcoma cases by cDNA microarray consisting of 23,040 genes. A hierarchical clustering analysis grouped SS and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor into the same category, and these two types of tumor shared expression patterns of numerous genes relating to neural differentiation. Several genes were up-regulated in almost all SS cases, and the presumed functions of known genes among them were related to migration or differentiation of neural crest cells, suggesting the possibility of neuroectodermal origin of SS. Moreover, we identified a set of genes that divided SS cases into two putative subclasses, a feature that may shed light on novel biological aspects of SS in addition to those having to do with epithelial differentiation. These data have provided clues for understanding the origin and tumorigenesis of SS.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 128 patients with nonmetastatic SS collected from a cooperative database by the FNCLCC Sarcoma Group between 1980 and 1994 were studied retrospectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed at diagnosis in 77 cases (61%). The tumors were classified as biphasic (n = 45), monophasic fibrous (n = 72), and poorly differentiated (n = 10) subtypes. Histologic grade was determined according to the FNCLCC method, and vascular invasion was assessed in every case. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate for this series of patients with localized SS was 62.9% (+/- 9.6% [SD]) with a median follow-up time of 37 months (range, 8 to 141 months). In multivariate analysis, the adverse risk factors associated with decreased DSS were International Union Against Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III/IVA disease, male sex, and truncal tumor locations. For metastasis-free survival (MFS), disease stage III/IVA, tumor necrosis, and monophasic subtypes were the major factors associated with a less favorable prognosis. Separately, when not using disease stage, tumor necrosis, and mitotic activity, histologic grade became the most significant prognostic factor for both DSS and MFS. In addition, larger tumors and older patients become associated with a significantly worse prognosis. Independent adverse risk factors for local recurrence-free survival included histologic grade 3 and truncal tumor location. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that not all SS present the same severe outcome. High-risk patients identified on the basis of these parameters may qualify for an aggressive treatment approach.",M1
11487273,"c-KIT and c-KIT ligand (SCF) in synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>): an mRNA expression analysis in 23 cases.In a previous immunophenotypic molecular-based analysis it was shown that bcl2 over-expression characterizes the SS gene profile in addition to the non-random translocations. Here we show that the over-expression of an additional potentially antiapoptotic gene, the c-KIT gene, is associated with this tumour. Interestingly, whereas bcl2 over-expression appears to be restricted to the spindle cell tumoral component, c-kit mainly involves the epithelial component of biphasic SS. Twenty-three primary and metastatic samples from 21 patients were analysed by immunophenotyping (23/23), immunoprecipitations and Western blotting (3/23), and RT-PCR (23/23). Ten cases were biphasic and 13 monophasic in sub-type. Twelve, 10 and 1 case carried the SYT-SSX1, SYT-SSX2 and SYT-SSX4 fusion transcript, respectively. Co-presence of both c-Kit and SCF mRNA was observed in almost all cases (20/23), suggesting the occurrence of an autocrine loop. Immunophenotyping, confirmed by biochemical analyses, showed a modulation of c-Kit expression which was faint in the spindle and strong in the epithelial component, respectively. The study was complemented by c-Met/HGF receptor/ligand expression and c-Met protein analysis with results superimposable to those already reported. Since in each tumour, epithelial and spindle cell components harbour the same type of translocation t(X;18) the present findings suggest a shifting of the anti-apoptotic role from BCL2 to c-KIT gene during the transition from the uncommitted spindle to the differentiated epithelial cells.",M1

Histologically and cytologically the tumor can pose diagnostic difficulty when the epithelial component is predominant. CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old female presented with a rapidly enlarging mass on the lower left side of the neck. Fine needle aspiration of the tumor yielded abundant, discohesive round-oval cells mingled with amorphous hyaline material, raising a suspicion of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. In addition, air-dried, Giemsa-stained smears demonstrated rosettelike structures with central magenta globular material, mimicking adenoid cystic carcinoma. However, histologic examination of the excised tumor, including immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, proved it to be a typical SS with copious basement membrane accumulations.

Here, we report for the first time that 2 forms of SYT mRNA are present in both normal tissues and SSs. By amplifying the full-length SYT cDNA of two SSs, we detected 2 bands, here designated N-SYT and I-SYT. The latter, previously undescribed, contains an in-frame insertion of 93 bp. Its sequencing revealed a 100% homology with the mouse SYT gene. These two SYT forms were present, although in different amounts, in all human normal tissues examined, including kidney, stomach, lung, colon, liver and synovia. Coexistence of N-SYT and I-SYT (both fused with SSX) was detected in a series of 59 SSs (35 monophasic and 24 biphasic) and in a SS cell line.

A molecular analysis of 221 mesenchymal tumors fixed in different fixatives.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a relatively rare sarcoma, which may be confused with several other mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal lesions. It bears the t(X;18) (SYT;SSX) translocation, which seems to be specific for this tumor type and can be detected in paraffin-embedded tissue, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the specificity and sensitivity of this detection method have rarely been examined in a large series. Using RT-PCR, we examined 250 mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal, benign and malignant, paraffin-embedded lesions for the SS t(X;18) (SYT-SSX) translocation. PCR products were obtained from 221 tumors (88.5%). There were 135 non-SS tumors, 22 biphasic, and 64 monophasic spindle/round cell SS, of which 10 were cytogenetically confirmed as t(X;18)-positive. SYT-SSX gene fusion transcripts were detected in the SS tumor category only (100% specificity), including 100% of the biphasic SS and 86% of monophasic spindle/round cell SS. Nine tumors originally diagnosed as SS were t(X;18) (SYT-SSX)-negative. Following reassessment, only 3 of these tumors showed clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and/or ultrastructural features consistent with that diagnosis, thus raising the overall detection sensitivity to 96%. With regard to the potential adverse effect of the fixatives used, PCR products were obtained in 100%, 91.5%, 90.5%, and 0% of tumors fixed with AFA, buffered formalin, Holland Bouin, and conventional Bouin's fluid, respectively.

11342772,"Calretinin and other mesothelioma markers in synovial sarcoma: analysis of antigenic similarities and differences with malignant mesothelioma.Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is a mesenchymal neoplasm that typically shows epithelial differentiation. SS commonly metastasizes to lung and pleura, and has also been reported as the primary in these locations. The histologic distinction of SS from mesothelioma may be difficult because of the combination of epithelioid and spindle cells, potentially shared locations, and antigenic expression. In this study the authors examined 103 well-documented SSs including 41 biphasic, 44 monophasic, and 18 poorly differentiated SSs in comparison with 23 epithelioid and seven sarcomatous mesotheliomas. Most biphasic SSs (29 of 41, 71%) had fields or foci of calretinin-positive tumor cells. The spindle cell components were more often positive (55%), whereas 14% of tumors had positive epithelial cells. The monophasic and poorly differentiated SSs commonly had foci of calretinin-positive cells (in 52% and 56% of cases respectively). In comparison, all 23 epithelioid mesotheliomas (EM) were extensively calretinin positive and seven sarcomatoid mesotheliomas were variably calretinin positive. HBME-1 positivity was similarly detected in biphasic SS and EM (100% and 87% respectively). Among the other sarcomas, two of 15 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors were focally calretinin positive, whereas 16 epithelioid sarcomas, 20 leiomyosarcomas, 20 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 20 angiosarcomas were negative. Biphasic SSs differed from mesotheliomas by their more common BerEp4 positivity (90%) whereas EMs showed focal reactivity in 13% cases. Marked CD15 reactivity was rare in both. Wilms tumor protein-1 (WT1) was not detected in SS, but was present in 12 of 17 EMs. CD141 was rare in SS, limited to spindle cell components, whereas EMs typically showed prominent membrane staining in epithelial cells. Simple epithelial keratins were present in all epithelial cells of biphasic SS and mesothelioma (keratin 7[K7], K19), but were only focal in monophasic and poorly differentiated SS. Biphasic SSs were extensively K14 positive (89% of cases), whereas epithelial and sarcomatoid mesotheliomas typically showed only scattered positive cells. The potentially shared calretinin patterns in SS and mesothelioma require the use of other markers. The discriminating features include extensive BerEp4 positivity, rarity of CD141, and lack of WT1 in SS. Global expression of K7 and K19 in mesotheliomas versus focal expression in monophasic and poorly differentiated SSs, and differential patterns of K14 expression may also be helpful.",M1
10961176,"Capacity for epithelial differentiation in synovial sarcoma: analysis of a new human cell line.AIM: To analyse the capacity for epithelial differentiation in synovial sarcoma using a new human cell line. METHODS: A new human cell line, KU-<e>SS</e>-1, was established from a monophasic, spindle cell type of synovial sarcoma by grafting those cells on to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and then transferring them to in vitro culture systems. The KU-SS-1 cells were characterised by light and electron microscopy, and by immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, and cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Primary tumour and cultured cells at passage 20 showed a positive reaction for vimentin, which is a mesenchymal marker. After 40 passages, subcultured cells were injected into SCID mice to induce further tumours. These advanced subcultured cells and the tumour cells that they induced were positive for cytokeratin, an epithelial marker, and exhibited epithelial ultrastructural features such as intermediate junctions. Furthermore, two colour immunofluorescent analysis for proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) and intermediate filaments showed that a large number of PCNA expressing cells were positive for vimentin, and that part of this fraction also expressed cytokeratin. The existence of cells with reactivity for these three markers indicated that, in this cell line, a fraction with high proliferating capacity had both mesenchymal and epithelial markers. In addition, cytogenetically, this cell line expressed the SYT-SSX chimaeric transcript as a result of the t(X;18) (p11;q11) translocation. CONCLUSIONS: A human synovial sarcoma cell line was established and stably maintained in cell culture for more than 70 passages. In addition, this cell line showed epithelial differentiation, which supports the hypothesis that synovial sarcoma is a carcinosarcoma like tumour with true epithelial differentiation. This cell line will be a useful tool for investigating the nature of this tumour and will contribute to clinical studies.",M1
10397263,"The SYT-SSX1 variant of synovial sarcoma is associated with a high rate of tumor cell proliferation and poor clinical outcome.Cytogenetically, synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by the translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), resulting in a fusion between the SYT gene on chromosome 18 and SSX1 or SSX2 on the X chromosome and the formation of new chimeric genes, SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2. We examined the potential clinical relevance of SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts together with tumor proliferation. In a series of 33 patients with primary SS, the type of fusion transcript was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR and sequence analysis. The proliferation rate was analyzed using anti-Ki-67 antibodies. One case carrying an atypical transcript with a 57-bp insert was excluded, leaving 13 SYT-SSX1 and 19 SYT-SSX2 cases for analysis. The hazard ratio (with respect to metastasis-free survival for patients with SYT-SSX1 versus patients with SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-36; log-rank P = 0.004). There was also an association with reduced overall survival for patients with SYT-SSX1 compared to patients with SYT-SSX2 (hazard ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-73; log-rank P = 0.02). The 5-year metastasis-free survival for patients with SYT-SSX1 was 42% versus 89% for patients with SYT-SSX2. There was a significant association between SYT-SSX1 and a high tumor proliferation rate (P = 0.02). We conclude that the findings suggest that the type of SYT-SSX fusion transcript determines the proliferation rate and is an important predictor of clinical outcome in patients with SS.",M1
10824918,"Association of SYT-SSX fusion types with proliferative activity and prognosis in synovial sarcoma.The t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation commonly found in synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) results in the fusion of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to either of two closely related genes, SSX1 and SSX2, on chromosome X. It has been suggested that patients who have SS bearing SYT-SSX1 fusion have worse prognosis than those bearing SYT-SSX2 fusion. However, little is known about the biologic basis or the relationship with the histopathologic risk factors in regard to the different fusion types. We analyzed 19 cases of SS with no metastasis at diagnosis. These tumors were classified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 types. The expression of Ki-67, p27, p53, and bcl-2 and various clinicopathologic parameters including mitotic rate were compared between the two fusion types. The SYT-SSX1 type fusion was associated with high Ki-67 expression (P = .011) and high mitotic rate (P = .070). No significant differences were found between the two types as to the expression of p27, p53, and bcl-2 and other clinicopathologic parameters. The survival analysis showed that SYT-SSX1-type fusion, high Ki-67 expression, and high mitotic rate correlated with shorter metastasis-free survival. These data suggested that SYT-SSX fusion type is associated with tumor cell proliferative activity and prognosis of patients who have SS.",M1

10563198,"Synovial sarcoma, histologically mimicking primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing's sarcoma at distant sites.We report a case of synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) showing unusual histology at distant sites. A 47-year-old man was aware of a tumor on the sole of his left foot. After preoperative chemotherapy with a diagnosis of SS, wide excision was performed. During postoperative chemotherapy, multiple tumorous lesions developed in the bone (including the whole spine) and both lungs. The patient died 1 year later. Histologically, the excised tumor of the foot showed a biphasic cellular pattern typical of SS, whereas at autopsy the bone and lung lesions were composed only of undifferentiated small round cells with cytoplasmic fibrillar processes. Homer-Wright rosettes were also observed. Immunohistochemically, 80% of the bone and lung tumor cells expressed MIC2 protein homogeneously. To clarify whether the bone and lung round cell tumors were metastatic lesions or second malignancies, especially primary primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)/Ewing's sarcoma (ES), we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of tumor type-specific fusion gene transcripts. The SYT/SSX fusion transcript was identified in both the foot and lung lesions, whereas the EWS/FLI1 transcript was not detected in either lesion. Therefore, we concluded that the multiple bone and lung tumors were poorly differentiated metastatic tumors, which arose from the SS of the foot. We also conclude that the identification of chimeric fusion transcripts can be successfully applied to poorly differentiated sarcomas and will help in the differential diagnosis of tumors that cannot be distinguished by conventional morphological examinations. Also, it should be remembered that cytoplasmic staining for MIC2 protein may occur in sarcomas other than PNET/ES.",M1
9500652,"Cytologic features of synovial sarcoma with emphasis on the monophasic fibrous variant: a morphologic and immunocytochemical analysis of bcl-2 protein expression.BACKGROUND: Monophasic fibrous synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) is the most common variant of SS but few cytologic studies concerning this entity are available. bcl-2 protein immunoexpression has been described as a characteristic marker of SS and is useful for its differentiation from other sarcomas. METHODS: Twelve cytologic specimens from 11 patients with histologically proven SS were reexamined. Ten samples were obtained by fine-needle aspiration and in two cases fluid from cystic tumoral areas was obtained at surgery. Nine cases corresponded to monophasic fibrous tumors and two to biphasic tumors. Immunoexpression of bcl-2 was evaluated in all histologic specimens and in six cytologic samples. bcl-2 protein also was evaluated in 13 soft tissue tumors. RESULTS: All cytologic specimens had a similar appearance. Most smears were highly cellular and were comprised of densely packed, tridimensional groups and numerous isolated, round to oval cells. Remarkable findings included cellular monomorphism and vascular structures within the cell groups. Only one case showed cytologic evidence of epithelial differentiation. Immunoexpression of bcl-2 protein was present in 10 of the 11 histologic specimens (90.9%) and in 5 of the 6 cytologic samples (83.3%). A positive result also was observed in malignant fibrous histiocytoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, infantile hemangiopericytoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, and malignant solitary fibrous tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Although cytomorphologic features of SS are characteristic enough to permit its recognition, clinical correlation is necessary for its correct diagnosis. The immunoexpression of bcl-2 protein is not specific of SS and other soft tissue tumors can show a similar positive reaction.",M1
9788260,"Coexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met proto-oncogene product in synovial sarcoma.Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a heterodimeric polypeptide growth factor that has pleiotropic roles, including those of mitogen, motogen and morphogen. The HGF receptor is characterized as a c-Met proto-oncogene product (c-Met), which is a heterodimeric tyrosine kinase receptor. Hepatocyte growth factor acts as a mediator between the mesenchymal and epithelial tissues because HGF is produced by mesenchymal cells and c-Met is mainly expressed on various epithelial cells. Furthermore, the HGF/c-Met system plays an important role in embryogenesis and the regeneration of various organs. Synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>) are unique sarcoma that show epithelial differentiation, but little is known about their histogenesis. The expression of HGF and c-Met was examined by immunohistochemistry in SS specimens from 12 patients (six each of biphasic and monophasic fibrous types). Immunohistochemical coexpression of HGF and c-Met was demonstrated in the epithelial component of five biphasic SS, while only c-Met was expressed in the epithelioid nests of three monophasic fibrous SS. The spindle cell component was negative for HGF and c-Met. In SS, positivity for epithelial markers, such as cytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen, was diffusely observed in the epithelial component and was focally observed in spindle cells, while vimentin was positive predominantly in the spindle cell component. The areas expressing HGF and c-Met corresponded to distinct epithelial structures; however, HGF and c-Met expression were not found in any other tumor cells expressing epithelial markers in the spindle cell component of SS. Considering the morphogenic effect of HGF, which has been known to be one of its most important roles, the unique immunohistochemical localization of HGF and c-Met in SS suggests that the HGF/c-Met system may be closely related to the formation of epithelial (glandular) structures in biphasic SS.",M1
10702413,"Alterations of cell cycle regulators in localized synovial sarcoma: A multifactorial study with prognostic implications.Genetic alterations of cell cycle regulators are thought to represent uncommon and possible secondary events in sarcomas characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations. The present study investigates this hypothesis on synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>), assessing the frequency of expression and possible clinical implications of detecting alterations in critical cell cycle regulatory proteins. A homogeneous cohort of 49 patients with localized SS, restricted to the extremity and with available long-term follow-up information, was selected from our files. We focused our study on molecules involved in the G1 checkpoint and G1-S transition, including cyclins D1 and E, p21(WAF1), p27(Kip1), mdm2, p53, and Ki67. A cutoff point of 10% immunoreactive tumor cell nuclei was selected to define a positive phenotype for any given marker, except for Ki67. High Ki67 proliferative index was considered when &gt;/=20% tumor cells displayed nuclear immunoreactivity. Biphasic SS were analyzed, taking into account separately the expression of these proteins in the spindle and glandular components. Disease specific survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test and Cox regression. The cohort of patients analyzed included 23 females and 26 males, and the histological type distribution was 35 monophasic and 14 biphasic SS. The median follow-up for survivors was 53 months, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 63% and a metastatic disease-free survival of 40%. The positive phenotypes identified for the different markers studied were as follows: cyclin D1, 59%; cyclin E, 29%; p21, 51%; p27, 69%; mdm2, 59%; p53, 16%; and Ki67, 59%. We observed that positive p53, cyclin E, and high Ki67 proliferative index were correlated with survival, but only Ki67 and p53 were independent variables for prognostication. The present study suggests that alterations of cell cycle regulators are more common events in SS than originally thought. p53 overexpression could be of use as a marker together with a high Ki67 proliferative index, in identifying a subset of SS patients with increased risk of tumor relapse.",M1
9584899,"Synovial sarcoma. Evaluation of prognosis with emphasis on the study of DNA ploidy and proliferation (PCNA and Ki-67) markers.Controversy still exists regarding the validity of parameters commonly used in the evaluation of prognosis of patients with synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). Forty-nine cases of previously untreated primary SS (23 females and 26 males, ranging in age from 7 to 81, with 31 tumors located in the lower extremity, 8 at the upper extremity and 10 at the trunchus), without regional lymph-node or distant metastases were studied. We investigated the relationship between (flow and image) DNA cytometry, proliferation activity, clinicopathologic parameters, and relapse-free and overall survival of the patients. The prognostic value of gender, age, duration of symptoms, location, compartmentalization, size, adequacy of surgical margins, residual tumor, adjuvant therapy, histologic subtype, extent of necrosis, glandular differentiation, calcification, and extent of hemangiopericytic areas, mitotic rate, amount of mast cells, blood vessel invasion, histologic (UICC and NCI) grades, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S and S+G2 phases, PCNA and Ki-67 labeling indices (LI), and TNM (UICC) stage of the tumors, were evaluated by univariate and multivariate (Cox hazard model) analyses. Short duration of symptoms (&lt;12 months), biphasic SS, scarcity of mast cells (&lt;10/10 HPF), high mitotic rate (&gt; or =10/10 HPF), high histologic grade (grade 3), high PCNA-LI (&gt; or =20%), high Ki-67-LI (&gt; or =10%), DNA aneuploidy, and advanced TNM stage (stage III) were features associated with significantly shorter relapse-free and overall 5-year survival rates in the univariate analyses. Scarcity of mast cells, high mitotic rate, or high PCNA-LI were significant predictors of poor survival, in addition to TNM stage in the multivariate analyses. The amount of mast cells was inversely correlated with mitotic rate and PCNA-LI. Scarcity of mast cells, high mitotic rate, or high PCNA-LI are factors associated with poor prognosis, in addition to advanced TNM stage in patients with localized SS.",M1

The review covers all children seen at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between May 1969 and December 1992 with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, of the 37 patients with the subtype SS, 16 received irradiation for the management of primary site disease. There were four IRS Group I, six Group II, four Group III, and two Group IV patients receiving irradiation. Tumor grade included seven Grade II, and nine Grade III lesions. TMN staging identified eight T1 and eight T2 lesions. Follow-up has ranged from 14 to 117 months (med = 33 months). All IRS Group I patients had documented local control. Five of six IRS Group II and 4/4 Group III patients have had documented local control at last follow-up. IRS Group IV patients had either local control tumor stabilization (n=1) or evidence of tumor regression (n=1) at autopsy. Complications following irradiation include wound dehiscence (n=1), surgery to revise a painful scar (n=1) extremity length discrepancy (n=2), and femoral head avascular necrosis (n=1). At last follow-up, 10 of 14 patients receiving curative intent irradiation remain alive. This review indicates questionable benefit to the addition of irradiation for patients with adequate surgical resection and having  good  tumor characteristics (Grade I, II; IRS Group I, TMN T1A,T1B. For lesions that have had incomplete resection or partial response to chemotherapy, there is evidence that irradiation may provide durable local control. The role of irradiation in those patients with IRS Group IV disease is at present confined to palliative roles until the time when more effective chemotherapy will mandate the decision to treat primary disease for curative measures.",M1
17300237,"Sweet's syndrome: a spectrum of unusual clinical presentations and associations.BACKGROUND: Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) is the prototypic neutrophilic dermatosis. First described in 1964, the characterization of new clinical associations, unique histopathological findings and clinical variants have stimulated much interest and discussion recently. However, the prevalence of these unusual variants and clinical associations within a single cohort of patients, has not been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate the prevalence of unusual clinical and histopathological features, as well as the clinical associations of SS seen in patients from the National Skin Centre, Singapore. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all consecutive cases of SS seen at our centre over a 5.5-year period (June 1999-December 2004). Data on associated systemic diseases was obtained from the medical records and matched with information from the National Cancer Registry, Singapore. Patients not actively followed up for more than 3 months were contacted for their updated health status. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were identified. Ten (27%) had non-idiopathic SS. These were associated with haematological disorders, connective tissue disorders, infections or a drug. Twenty-nine patients (78%) had at least one atypical clinical or histopathological feature. Atypical clinical features included bullous lesions, SS with hand involvement or neutrophilic dermatoses of the hands and the concomitant existence of subcutaneous SS with pyoderma gangrenosum. SS was the presenting feature in three patients with infections caused by atypical organisms, including Mycobacterium chelonae, Penicillium species and Salmonella type D. Unique histopathological variants included subcutaneous SS and lesions containing an admixture of mature and immature neutrophils. Subcutaneous neutrophilic inflammation seemed to be more common in patients with an underlying haematological disorder. This group of patients also had a lower mean haemoglobin level. CONCLUSIONS: Unusual clinical and histopathological variants of SS described in the literature are similarly encountered in our cohort of patients, with some features being more common than others. We highlight and discuss some unique clinical and histopathological observations seen in our patients with SS.",M2

9112270,"Synovial sarcoma: immunohistochemical expression of P-glycoprotein and glutathione S transferase-pi and clinical drug resistance.Our purpose was to study the role of the expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and glutathione S transferase-pi (GST-pi) in predicting the response to chemotherapy, relapse-free interval, and survival of patients with synovial sarcoma (<e>SS</e>). Thirty-seven cases of primary SS, without regional lymph node or distant metastases, were studied. There were 17 females and 20 males, ranging in age from 7 to 81 years (median, 31 years) with tumors located in the lower extremity (n = 24) upper extremity (n = 5) and trunchus (n = 8). The cases were retrospectively studied without knowledge of clinical course to compare the immunohistochemical expression of Pgp and GST-pi, flow cytometry parameters (ploidy and % of cells in S+G2 phases), and PCNA and Ki-67 labeling of primary tumors before any therapy, with that observed in local recurrences and metastases after chemotherapy. The relationship of the aforementioned parameters with clinicopathological features (gender, age, and histo-blood group of the patients, size, location, histological subtype. TNM stage, and clinical response to chemotherapy of the tumors) was also evaluated. Results revealed that Pgp and GST-pi were expressed in 29.7% and 40.5% of the cases, respectively. In 48.6% of the tumors there was expression of a least one of the drug resistance markers. The markers were coexpressed in 25.0% of the tumors. The prevalence of Pgp expression was lower, but not significantly, in stage I-II (17.6%) than in stage III (40.0%) tumors, and also in cases without clinical progression (16.7%), than in cases with (36.0%). No such differences were observed for GST-pi expression. Pgp and GST-pi expressions were significantly associated with biphasic SS and were particularly noticeable in solid/glandular areas of biphasic SS. The expression of the drug resistance markers was not significantly associated with gender, age, and histo-blood group of the patients, dimension, location, and proliferative activity of the tumors; it was also not significantly related to relapse-free interval and survival of the patients. The expression of Pgp and GST-pi was not significantly associated either to response to chemotherapy or influenced by chemotherapy. We conclude that Pgp and GST-pi expressions are not good predictors response to of the chemotherapy in patients with localized SS. Other drug resistance mechanisms may be active in SS.",M1

7495284,"Molecular diagnosis of synovial sarcoma and characterization of a variant SYT-SSX2 fusion transcript.The translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) is seen in &gt; 80% of synovial sarcomas (<e>SS</e>) with informative karyotypes. The breakpoints of the t(X;18) have been cloned and shown to involve two novel genes, SSX (at Xp11) and SYT (at 18q11), which produce a chimeric SYT-SSX transcript as a result of the translocation. Recently, SSX has been shown to be duplicated, with both copies, SSX1 and SSX2, located within distinct subregions of Xp11. We performed a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for both chimeric SYT-SSX transcripts in a series of 35 SS (29 monophasic, 6 biphasic) to assess its usefulness in molecular diagnosis and to evaluate the incidence of molecular variants. Of the 35 cases, 29 (83%) showed a specific SYT-SSX RT-PCR product, using a consensus primer for SSX1 and SSX2 Upon excluding three negative cases that had poor quality RNA, the proportion of positives rose to 91% (29/32). The 29 positive cases were further studied using primers specific for either SSX1 or SSX2; 19 cases were positive for SYT-SSX1 and 10 for SYT-SSX2. The relationship of histological subtype (monophasic versus biphasic) to SSX1 or SSX2 involvement was not statistically significant. In a single histologically unremarkable monophasic SS, a slightly larger SYT-SSX2 RT-PCR product was observed. Sequencing of this novel variant showed a 129-bp segment inserted between the usual SYT and SSX2 fusion points, of which 126 bp were derived from a more proximal (5') portion of SSX2 The 3 bp immediately 5' to the fusion point could not be assigned to either SYT or SSX2 and may represent an insertion-deletion or a cryptic splicing event. This fragment maintains the reading frame of the chimeric product and encodes a predicted protein larger by 43 amino acids, which nevertheless replaces the region homologous to the transcriptional repression domain Kruppel-associated box, recently recognized in the 5' portion of the SSX genes, with all but the 3' end of the SYT transcript. Thus, a diagnosis of SS may be confirmed in &gt; 90% of cases using RT-PCR detection of the chimeric transcript resulting from the t(X;18), and the incidence of molecular variants appears low.",M1

15148101,"Elevated serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels in patients with active phase of sweet syndrome and patients with active behcet disease: implication in neutrophil apoptosis dysfunction.BACKGROUND: Sweet syndrome (<e>SS</e>), an acute inflammatory disease, has clinical and laboratory features similar to those of Behçet disease (BD). Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are elevated in patients with SS, and exogenous administration of G-CSF has repeatedly been implicated in the causation of SS. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the production and differentiation of neutrophils. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the role of elevated serum G-CSF levels in patients with active SS and active BD compared with those with inactive SS or BD and healthy controls. To then analyze neutrophil apoptosis in the active state of SS and BD; and to also investigate the influence of autologous serum on neutrophil apoptosis. METHODS: Serum G-CSF was examined in 5 patients with active SS, 7 with inactive SS, 7 with active BD, 9 with inactive BD, and 5 healthy controls by means of an enzyme immunoassay kit. We measured apoptotic cells in the neutrophil fraction of peripheral blood collections in patients with active diseases and controls by means of flow cytometry. RESULTS: Serum G-CSF level was significantly higher in patients with active SS than in those with inactive SS. The difference in serum G-CSF levels among patients with active and inactive BD was also significant. Serum G-CSF level was significantly higher in patients with active SS than in those with active BD. Neutrophil apoptosis was significantly higher in patients with active SS than healthy controls. This increased apoptosis rate was also seen in patients with active BD. The increased rate of neutrophil apoptosis was significantly suppressed when the neutrophils were cultured for 18 hours in the presence of autologous active SS serum. Similarly, neutrophil apoptosis was suppressed in the presence of autologous serum in patients with active BD, but not significantly so. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased production of G-CSF in patients with SS and BD may play an important role in the manifestation of these disorders. Given the suppression of neutrophil apoptosis in the active state in the presence of the influence of autologous serum, which includes elevated G-CSF level, we propose that serum G-CSF plays a significant role in the suppression of neutrophil apoptosis. Furthermore, G-CSF-induced suppression of neutrophil apoptosis appears to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of SS and BD.",M2
18300309,"Metachronous manifestations of Sweet's syndrome in a neutropenic patient with Fanconi anemia.Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) is an acute, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that frequently presents with leukocytosis and erythematous plaques. Lesions show neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis and rarely other organs. We report the case of an adolescent male with chronic pancytopenia secondary to Fanconi anemia (FA) who presented with acute respiratory distress. Despite an exhaustive and ultimately unrevealing work-up, the diagnosis of pulmonary SS was not made until he developed characteristic cutaneous lesions 4 months later. Comprehensive review of pathological specimens revealed metachronous SS manifestations with infiltrates in lung parenchyma, dermis, and subcutis in this neutropenic patient.",M2
18072629,"[Development of Sweet syndrome in an acute promyelocyte leukemia patient during treatment with all-trans retinoic acid--case report and literature review]OBJECTIVE: To identify the side effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and improve early therapeutic response in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). METHOD: The first case of Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) developed in a APL patient treated with ATRA was reported in mainland of China, and reviewed correlative literature. RESULTS: Only 14 cases of SS associated with ATRA therapy in APL have been reported in the literature, including the present case. The median age was 49.5 years (9 -84) and 10 were women and 4 men. Of them, SS was restricted to the skin in 10 case, the other 4 muscle, fascia, kidney, and lung were involved. SS appeared after a median of 18 days of ATRA therapy (6 - 34 days). The median WBC count was 7.05 (0.80 - 23.00) x 10(9)/L. Four patients continued with the ATRA therapy without interruption, 13 patients treated with steroids and 12 responded. One patient improved without any treatment. Two cases of SS developed retinoic acid syndromes after ATRA therapy. CONCLUSION: Sweet's syndrome is a rare adverse effect of ATRA, and has similar features with inflammatory or infective dermatosis. The corticosteroids treatment could improve the systemic and cutaneous symptoms. When ATRA therapy was restarted after SS subsided, no recurrence of rashes was observed.",M2
17576331,"Clonality in the setting of Sweet's syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum is not limited to underlying myeloproliferative disease.BACKGROUND: The neutrophilic dermatoses encompass, among others, Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), which are associated with underlying systemic diseases including myeloid dyscrasias. METHODS: On skin biopsies from 16 patients with biopsy-proven SS and/or PG, we performed an X-inactivation assay to detect clonal restriction of neutrophils. There were two patient categories based on known diseases at the time of diagnosis: patients with myeloproliferative disease and patients without myeloproliferative disease. RESULTS: Among seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and two with myelodysplastic syndrome, clonal restriction was found in five; three were homozygous, precluding analysis. Among the seven control patients, infiltrates were clonally restricted in five; one was polyclonal and the other was homozygous for the allele, precluding analysis. Of the five patients with clonally restricted infiltrates, one was subsequently diagnosed with myelodysplasia, one had unexplained neutropenia and an additional patient developed breast cancer. Overall, the incidence of clonality in both groups was the same, averaging 81%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that clonality in neutrophilic dermatoses, while characteristic of underlying myeloid dyscrasia, is not observed exclusively in the setting of myeloproliferative diseases. The significance of clonal neutrophilic infiltrates unassociated with myeloproliferative disease is unclear, but it may have some implications regarding the pathogenesis of sterile neutrophilic infiltrates. Clonality is well described in the setting of lymphomatoid hypersensitivity, reflecting an overzealous response to antigenic stimuli. One could speculate a similar mechanism operational in cases of apparently reactive SS/PG associated with monoclonality; a localized form of cutaneous neutrophilic dyscrasia is also possible.",M2
17426076,"Drug-induced Sweet's syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the pertinent literature on drug-induced Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-December 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 2006), Science Citation Index (1945-December 2006), and EMBASE (1980-December 2006) were searched using the key terms Sweet's syndrome, drug-induced, and acute neutrophilic dermatitis. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All case reports of drug-induced SS located using the above databases were collected for causality assessment. In addition, relevant articles regarding the various causes and presentations of SS were selected to provide background information. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: All case reports of drug-induced SS were evaluated against an expanded Naranjo scale with specific criteria for SS. Tables were developed listing key criteria for evaluating the case reports for causality. Data were evaluated by quantity and quality of evidence, and an assessment was made as to whether there was a feasible pharmacologic mechanism to explain causality. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and vaccines met 2 of 3 criteria for an association with SS. There are sufficient data and a plausible pharmacologic mechanism for G-CSF and ATRA. Vaccines meet the qualitative criteria and also have a plausible pharmacologic mechanism. The evidence regarding minocycline is of high quality; however, the quantity of evidence and a reasonable pharmacologic mechanism are lacking. A host of miscellaneous drugs have also been implicated in causing the disorder, all without sufficient evidence.",M2
17424710,"[Sweet's syndrome: a propos of 8 cases]BACKGROUND: Sweet's syndrome is a dermatosis classically determined by painful erythematous plaques or nodules associated with fever, neutrophilia and dense neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. In most cases, Sweet's syndrome may occur in the absence of other diseases. However, it can be associated with an inflammatory disease and essentially with malignant conditions in 20% of cases requiring a careful investigation. AIM: We report herein, the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutive features of a hospital serie. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all the files of patients conforming with the diagnosis of <e>SS</e>, seen at the dermatology departement of Habib Thameur hospital during a 7-year period (from 1997 to 2003). All patients fulfilled at least two major criteria and two minor criteria of Su et Liu's diagnostic criteria modified by Von Den Driesch. RESULTS: 8 cases of .Sweet's syndrome were diagnosed. All patients were females. The mean age was 51.62 years. The lesions occurred on the upper limbs in 7/8 cases. SS was isolated in 6 cases and para-inflammatory in one case corresponding to an associated Sjogren's syndrome. Besides the standard therapy using oral corticosteroids (3 patients), non steroidal inflammatory agents has been efficient in 4 cases. CONCLUSION: In our serie, we report an exclusive female involvement and a lower frequency of associated diseases compared with the relevant literature. Association of SS and Sjogren's syndrome is exceptional. To our knowledge, only 6 cases have already been reported.",M2

He had a 12-year history of refractory anemia, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome. Repeated bacterial cultures of exudates from the lesion of the left zygomatic area showed growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. A biopsy of a plaque on the back showed edema of the papillary dermis and marked neutrophilic infiltrates in the upper dermis. The patient was diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>), and responded well to combination therapy of amoxycilline/sulbactam and corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SS associated with skin S. epidermidis infection.",M2
11048979,"Immature myeloid precursors in chronic neutrophilic dermatosis associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.Sweet syndrome (<e>SS</e>) associated with myeloproliferative disorders has been considered an inflammatory process mediated by neutrophils in which immunologic mechanisms are operative. The authors report the case of a 68-year-old man suffering from a myelodysplastic syndrome, who presented with a relapsing skin eruption resembling SS. Histopathologically, the skin infiltrates showed prominent neutrophilic features masking the underlying malignant process. Extensive immunophenotypic studies of skin revealed the presence of a few immature myeloid cells intermingled with an overwhelming infiltrate of neutrophils. The atypical cells in the skin had a phenotype identical to that of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Whether or not immature myeloid cell precursors constitute a specific infiltrate of leukemia cutis or are a result of recruitment of circulating leukemic cells to this area of inflammation is discussed.",M2
10689901,"[Interstitial pneumonitis associated with Sweet's syndrome in the elderly]Sweet's syndrome occurring during the course of interstitial pneumonitis in a 70-year-old woman was encountered. She was admitted because of dyspnea on exercise, dry cough and interstitial shadow on chest x-ray. Lung biopsy, together with other findings confirmed interstitial pneumonitis. Five days after admission, genital ulcer and aphtha on the oral mucosa were detected and exudative erythema appeared on her right shoulder, chest and back. Histological examination of the skin lesions demonstrated numerous nutrophilic infiltration in the upper dermis, indicating Sweet's syndrome. The skin eruption rapidly disappeared on treatment with colchicine. Although six months after admission interstitial pneumonitis caused respiratory failure, treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide was effective. Serological and immunological tests demonstrated hyper-gammaglobulinemia and positive reaction for anti <e>SS</e>-A antibody. Pathological examination of the lip revealed numerous lymphocyte infiltrates around the duct of the minor salivary gland, suggesting Sjögren's syndrome as the background disease of Sweet's syndrome and interstitial pneumonitis. This evidence indicating that even in elderly patients, skin lesions of Sweet's syndrome may reveal the background disease.",M2
16643136,"Sweet's syndrome on the area of postmastectomy lymphoedema.BACKGROUND: Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) has been reported in association with many conditions, including malignancy, infections, autoimmune disorders, pregnancy and drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients with SS-like lesions on the lymphoedema area seen in our department. Clinical manifestations, histopathologic characteristics, treatment and outcome data were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: We report seven women with a history of surgery for breast cancer with axillary lymphadenectomy. Six of them were on tamoxifen. All of them had various lesions consistent with SS localized predominantly on the limb affected by the postmastectomy lymphoedema, and on the ipsilateral chest, trunk and back. One of them presented bullous lesions. Three of the cases underwent spontaneous remission, two resolved with antibiotic therapy, one healed with corticosteroids, and one with corticosteroids plus antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Erythematous tender plaques on the area of postmastectomy lymphoedema could be considered an unusual manifestation of Sweet's syndrome. We have found only three similar cases in the literature. Although it is difficult to elucidate the pathogenesis of this entity, it has been suggested that it could be due to immune surveillance impairment.",M2

16179788,"Sweet's syndrome--an extraintestinal manifestation in inflammatory bowel disease.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) is a severe dermatosis that may be an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Worldwide, 35 cases of SS associated with IBD have been reported. We present the first case of severe, recurrent SS in combination with amebic infection and ulcerative colitis complicated with multiple other extraintestinal manifestations. METHODS: Disease course was monitored by serum YKL-40 and C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, albumin and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SSCAI). The amebic infection was diagnosed by direct microscopy of wet mount scrapings sampled by repetitive sigmoidoscopies. RESULTS: The patient was diagnosed with left-sided ulcerative colitis and SS combined with extraintestinal manifestations: arthropathies, iridocyclitis and erythema nodosum. Cysts of Entamoeba histolytica were detected in the stools in two separate periods of time. Serum YKL-40 increased prior to CRP and correlated with disease activity, SCCAI, CRP, white blood cell count and inversely with serum albumin. CONCLUSION: This case gives further support for SS being an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis. YKL-40 may be useful in monitoring the disease course of IBD.",M2

16027306,"A case of Sweet syndrome associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis.BACKGROUND: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet syndrome (<e>SS</e>), is a condition that is presumed to be triggered by infectious disease agents. We report a case of SS associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), which is of interest because Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects, multiplies in, and disrupts the function of neutrophils, the key infiltrating cell in SS. OBSERVATIONS: A patient with initial dermatologic manifestations of SS who did not respond to standard SS treatment was suspected to have concurrent HGA with the demonstration of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminase levels. The HGA diagnosis was established when morulae in neutrophils were observed on a peripheral blood smear, a finding confirmed by both serologic examination and polymerase chain reaction on the skin biopsy specimen used to establish the SS diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The significant involvement of neutrophils with both SS and HGA warrants a broader search for additional cases that may further define whether pathogenetic linkages could exist.",M2
15954518,"Sweet syndrome associated with furosemide.This case report describes a case of Sweet syndrome (<e>SS</e>) related to use of furosemide in a 46-year-old female who was admitted for treatment of congestive heart failure. Three days after administration of furosemide, the patient had a fever and a skin eruption appeared on her wrists, forearms, and legs. Biopsy of the skin lesion was consistent with SS. Infection was thought to be unlikely because of negative blood cultures, echocardiography, and other imaging studies. Careful review of her medications revealed that the patient received furosemide before the appearance of the skin eruption and fever. After discontinuation of furosemide, the patient's skin lesion and fever resolved. A MEDLINE search from June 1966 to May 2004 revealed only one reference documenting the association of SS with furosemide administration. Patients who have development of SS without an obvious cause should have their medication list closely reviewed.",M2

The patient developed a fever in association with multiple tender, purpuric and pustular skin lesions and swelling of both calves after receiving rHuG-CSF 3 micrograms/kg/d for 4 days. The absolute neutrophil count was 0.55 x 10(9)/L at onset. A skin biopsy revealed a dense neutrophilic infiltration in the dermis without evidence of vasculitis or infection. All skin and calf lesions regressed within 1 week after prednisolone therapy.

12774928,"Sweet's syndrome associated with recurrent fever in a patient with trisomy 8 myelodysplastic syndrome.In the case of a 69-year-old man suffering from recurrent high fever, laboratory data demonstrated elevated inflammatory findings such as neutrophilic leukocytosis and an increase in serum level of C-reactive protein. A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or a low dose of prednisolone proved to be temporarily effective. A bone marrow specimen showed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of the refractory anemia (RA) type with trisomy 8. Seven months after onset, painful erythematous eruptions were found on both legs. Biopsy of a skin lesion demonstrated neutrophic infiltration into the dermis. As a result, Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings. Administration of prednisolone (30 mg/d) was started and resulted in prompt defervescence and resolution of the lesions within 1 week. We also investigated serum levels of 3 cytokines: interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Levels of IL-6 and G-CSF were elevated during the active phase, but the level of IL-1beta did not increase. Because cases of MDS with trisomy 8 and SS or Behçet disease have been reported recently, our findings suggested that cytokine production, which enhances neutrophil function, is elevated in some MDS patients with trisomy 8; that is, not only cytokines but also trisomy 8 may be related to the pathogenesis of SS in MDS. It is thus advisable to watch for development of SS during follow-up of MDS patients with recurrent fever or trisomy 8.",M2
12680958,"Sweet syndrome in multiple myeloma: a series of six cases.BACKGROUND: Sweet syndrome (<e>SS</e>), a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by fever, neutrophilia, multiple erythematous painful plaques, and a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltration, has a known association with hematologic malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia. However, no clear association with multiple myeloma (MM) has been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology reports of the 2357 patients with multiple myeloma at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences were reviewed to retrieve cases who had developed SS. Cytogenetic studies and immunoglobulin secretory status were retrieved. Five cases of SS in MM and 25 cases of SS in patients without MM underwent syndecan-1 immunohistochemistry. OBSERVATIONS: Six cases of SS occurring in the setting of MM showed a predominance in patients secreting IgG paraprotein. Five of the six patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor while the sixth received granulocyte-monocyte-colony stimulating factor. Fifty percent showed a non-specific cytogenetic anomaly. CONCLUSIONS: There is no specific cytogenetic anomaly associated with SS in the setting of MM. This paraneoplastic syndrome may be secondary to elevated levels of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), possibly with a component of enhanced sensitivity to endogenous G-CSF. The immunoglobulin secretory status parallels that seen in MM with cutaneous involvement, but IgG secretors may be at an increased risk of developing SS compared with their counterparts who secrete other immunoglobulins.",M2
11890302,"Sweet's syndrome evolved from recurrent erythema nodosum in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome.A 63-year-old man had painful nodules on his lower legs. Microscopic examination showed septal and lobular panniculitis composed of lympho-histiocytic infiltrates. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the diagnosis of erythema nodosum (EN) was made. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were temporarily effective, but the eruptions had repeated to the present, and 16 months later, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was diagnosed. Then, 6 months later, he developed a high fever and edematous fresh red-colored nodules on his neck, arm and upper trunk. Histopathologically, a diffuse, dense, dermal infiltrate of neutrophils was seen, and Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) was diagnosed. SS is known to develop in patients with MDS, and EN is one of the dermatoses that occur in conjunction with hematoproliferative disorders. Furthermore, SS evolving from recurrent EN and the simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN have been reported in some patients. In our case, we suggest that some mediators such as cytokines associated with MDS might have first induced EN, and then, as the MDS developed, they were replaced by others that caused SS.",M2

11695304,"[Sweet syndrome in a female patient with intestinal multiple lipomas and diverticular disease of the colon]Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>), or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a condition characterized by the sudden onset of fever, leukocytosis, and painful, erythematous, well-demarcated papules and plaques which show dense, neutrophilic infiltrates on histologic examination. Myalgias and arthralgias are common. Although it may occur in the absence of other known disease, SS is often associated with hematologic disease (including leukemia), and immunologic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). A case of SS is reported. Furthermore the patient presented multiple intestinal lipomas and diverticular colon disease. The authors, on the ground of recent studies which correlate SS with several digestive system disorders, hypothesize an association between acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and patient's intestinal diseases. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids is usually successful.",M2
11168757,"Sweet's syndrome in the setting of CD34-positive acute myelogenous leukemia treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor: evidence for a clonal neutrophilic dermatosis.BACKGROUND: Sweet's syndrome in the setting of hematologic dyscrasias can be categorized into paraneoplastic-associated <e>SS</e>, drug-induced SS, and SS with leukemia cutis. Apart from those cases demonstrating concomitant leukemic infiltrates, it has been surmised that SS is a reactive phenomenon induced by a specific cytokine milieu. METHODS: The authors present a patient with CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia (AAML) who developed SS in the setting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy. Routine light microscopy and molecular studies were carried on the patient's skin biopsy specimen and post-treatment marrow. An X inactivation assay for clonality was employed. RESULTS: Routine light microscopic examination revealed differentiated myeloid precursors including myelocytes and metamyelocytes within the subcutis; myeloblasts were not identified. In addition, in the overlying skin, features typical of SS were observed. The neutrophils demonstrated dysplastic features including hypolobation compatible with a Pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly. X inactivation studies showed clonality both within her post-treatment marrow and skin biopsy specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome developing in CD34+ AML patients following GCSF therapy likely reflects therapy induced differentiation of sequestered leukemic cells, hence indicative of a clonal neutrophilic dermatosis.",M2

Our review of the literature revealed only 11 biopsy-proved cases in which the 2 reactive dermatoses occurred together. None were associated with an underlying malignant neoplasm. OBSERVATIONS: We report a biopsy-proved case of SS and EN occurring simultaneously in a patient with an underlying malignant neoplasm (specifically, acute myelogenous leukemia). We also report another biopsy-proved case of SS and EN occurring simultaneously in a patient with underlying Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN in 1 patient is rarely reported. Both disorders are reactive dermatoses that share many overlapping features. Although individually distinctive, SS and EN are also part of a growing continuum of reactive dermatoses. Our expanded understanding of the similarities and simultaneous manifestation of SS and EN may help us in the future to identify a common underlying mechanism of pathogenesis.",M2
9854164,"Sweet's syndrome associated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.We present two patients who developed Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) during recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. Case 1 : on day 11 of the fifth cycle of G-CSF treatment, a 21-year-old man with relapsed, intracranial germ cell tumor had fever, and painful, subcutaneous nodules on his right arm and right leg concomitant with neutrophilia. Skin biopsy revealed neutrophilic panniculitis. The skin lesions disappeared completely after discontinuance of G-CSF. Case 2 : on day 7 of G-CSF treatment, a 50-year-old woman with small cell lung cancer developed fever, and widely disseminated pruritic erythema on her trunk and extremities. The histopathology of the skin was compatible with SS. Her skin lesions also disappeared after discontinuance of G-CSF treatment.

9843005,"Sweet's syndrome: is the pathogenesis mediated by helper T cell type 1 cytokines?BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis; <e>SS</e>) is still not fully understood. An imbalance between helper T cell types 1 and 2 cytokine secretion patterns has been shown to be relevant in many diseases. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the serum cytokine levels (interleukin [IL]-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, interferon gamma [IFN-gamma], IL-4) in patients with SS. METHODS: Eight patients with SS were analyzed for their clinical features and serum cytokine levels and compared with normal control subjects. Results: In patients serum levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated, whereas the IL-4 level was within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the pathogenesis of SS is probably mediated through helper T cell type 1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) rather than helper T cell type 2 cytokines (IL-4).",M2

Peripheral blood neutrophilia is frequently seen in association with SS and is one of the diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, laboratory, and hematologic data of four patients with myeloid leukemia who developed SS after chemotherapy. Three of these patients were neutropenic. METHODS: A retrospective study of four patients with SS and hematologic malignancies was undertaken. Three patients had de novo acute myelogenous leukemia and one was in the acute blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: Sweet's syndrome was not originally suspected in these patients because of the low peripheral white blood cell counts caused by chemotherapy. All of the patients presented with fevers, arthralgias, and an eruption. They had been treated with antibiotics because of a presumed infection. Once the correct diagnosis was made and oral prednisolone was started, a rapid response followed. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis when acute myeloid leukemic patients develop skin lesions and unexplained fevers regardless of the peripheral blood counts.",M2

Two patients (12%) suffered from a malignant neoplasia (acute myeloid leukemia and prostatic neoplasia), another patient had a coincident bout of acute ulcerative colitis with pyoderma gangrenosum, and a third one referred previous ingestion of diclofenac and intense sun exposure. Most patients had their lesions localized on the upper extremities (75%), fever was present in 8 cases (50%), arthralgia in six (37%), and erythema nodosum in five (31%). The most frequent laboratory finding was an elevated sedimentation rate (93% had values over 20 mm/h), and only 44% of patients had leukocyte counts over 10 x 10(9)/l. Urinanalysis was abnormal in one third of the patients, and chest roentgenograms, performed in ten patients, were all normal.

7672985,"[Overlap of Sjögren-lupus erythematosus syndrome]Patients with anti-SSA(Ro)-positive Sjögren's syndrome (<e>SS</e>)/lupus erythematosus (LE) overlap are a immunogenetically, serologically and clinically homogeneous group; what they have in common is an increased frequency of the HLA-DR3 phenotype, demonstrating SSA(Ro) antibody activity and the typical annular, polycyclic, erythematous lesions of subacute cutaneous LE. The sicca symptoms of SS may develop long after the cutaneous lesions of LE have been present, or vice versa, as well as vasculitic, purpuric, and Sweet's syndrome-like lesions. The elderly, predominantly female patients are at enhanced risk for pulmonary and neurological disease, but glomerulonephritis occurs infrequently. We present an 81-year-old, SSA(Ro) antibody-positive and HLA-DR3-positive woman with SS/LE overlap syndrome, who had cutaneous LE for 30 years, developing sicca symptoms, vasculitic and Sweet's syndrome-like skin lesions only years after the LE symptoms. Although there is still some discussion as to whether phenotypical SS/LE overlap represents a distinct disease or is secondary SS in SLE or systemic SS with cutaneous involvement, the SS/LE overlap syndrome seems well enough delineated to be considered as a disease entity with separate implications for therapy and prognosis. Its position in the spectrum of anti-SSA(Ro) antibody- and HLA-DR3-positive diseases and its relationship to SS and to anti-SSA(Ro) antibody-positive LE are discussed.",M2
7861810,"Sweet's syndrome: systemic signs and symptoms and associated disorders.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the findings associated with acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome [<e>SS</e>]) and the response of SS to treatment. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 48 cases of SS encountered at the Mayo Clinic between 1980 and 1992. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Histopathologic specimens and medical records were studied to determine initial manifestations, patterns of involvement, systemic signs and symptoms (including mucosal, musculoskeletal, hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal findings), and conditions associated with SS. RESULTS: In patients with SS, the typical manifestations are the acute onset of tender, erythematous or violaceous nodules or plaques in association with fever, leukocytosis, and dermal neutrophilia. In our study group, the cutaneous lesions most frequently involved the arms and legs. Of our 48 patients, 26 (54%) had a hematopoietic, plasma cell, or malignant disorder, and many of these patients had associated anemia, especially the male patients. No single laboratory finding specifically indicated an association with serious systemic disease. Most patients were treated with a tapering dose of prednisone, which yielded a good response. CONCLUSION: Clinical acumen and appropriate laboratory tests are the main requirements for detection of hematologic disorders, internal malignant diseases, or other systemic conditions associated with SS.",M2
7532508,"The possible role of G-CSF in the pathogenesis of Sweet's syndrome.Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) is characterized by the clinical features of fever, leucocytosis, neutrophilia and the sudden onset of asymmetric, often very painful skin lesions and dense dermal infiltrates of mature neutrophils without signs of vasculitis. Apart from idiopathic cases the disease is frequently associated with hematological malignancies, but it may also be observed in patients with solid tumors, mainly tumors of the genito-urinary tract. In the past, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of this rare disease. SS has been interpreted as a direct response to mechanical and chemical irritants, an infectious disease or a disorder of neutrophilic chemotaxis and/or phagocytosis, but most often it has been described as a hypersensitivity reaction. Each of these theories can account for particular symptoms, but none of them reconciles the dominating clinical and laboratory features of the disease. Furthermore recently published casuistic observations suggest the involvement of certain cytokines in particular G-CSF and Il-6 in the pathogenesis of the disease, which might explain many of the observed clinical and laboratory findings. The following article summarizes these data and gives a review of the current literature.",M2
7504506,"Sweet's syndrome associated with G-CSF.Sweet's syndrome (<e>SS</e>) developed in two patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for febrile neutropenia due to AML chemotherapy. Fever, painful skin and conjunctival lesions developed and neutrophilic infiltration was detected at biopsy specimens. Neutrophilia was not detected. Skin lesions regressed within 1-2 weeks and conjunctival lesions within 4 weeks following the cessation of G-CSF. We conclude that SS may be a complication of G-CSF therapy and tender skin and/or conjunctival lesions developing during G-CSF therapy should suggest the possibility of SS.",M2

During the acute phase of the disease with high remittent fever, painful skin lesions and maximal leucocytosis IL-6 and G-CSF serum levels were extremely high, while TNF-alpha was only slightly elevated and gamma-interferon and IL1-beta were not increased. On clinical improvement IL-6 serum levels rapidly fell, whereas G-CSF values already slightly elevated before the manifestation of the disease slowly declined. High G-CSF levels triggered by a yet unknown factor could explain the leucocytosis, neutrophilic dermatosis and skin lesions in SS, while IL-6 probably induced the associated clinical symptoms of fever and pain.",M2

Six had acute myeloid leukaemia and one chronic myeloid leukaemia. SS developed during G-CSF therapy in two patients and following long periods of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in two. This finding may suggest a possible role of G-CSF in the pathogenesis of SS. SS was diagnosed during the first presentation of three patients with leukaemia. Skin lesions on the lower extremities in two patients, widespread distribution in one, a local infiltration at the inguinal region and pleural effusion in one were interesting findings in our patients which are not usual for classical SS.",M2
