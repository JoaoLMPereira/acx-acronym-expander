17065096,"Analysis of deoxycytidine accumulation in gemcitabine treated patients.Deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) analogs are increasingly popular as chemotherapeutic agents and their effectiveness can be linked to the direct competition with active forms of endogenous CdR. A tandem mass spectrometric assay was developed to determine the plasma concentrations of CdR. Plasma extracts were prepared by protein precipitation and an ethyl acetate/water back extraction, and then separated chromatographically. Detection parameters were optimized for multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) tandem mass spectrometry and assay efficiency was improved using 15N3 CdR as an isotopic internal standard. Preliminary results from a gemcitabine trial are shown which indicate that CdR concentrations increase systemically during infusion, from about 5 nM to 78 nM after hepatic artery infusion and to 102 nM after systemic infusion for 24 hours. The developed assay demonstrated good sensitivity and selectivity for CdR.",M1
17056304,"The determination of gemcitabine and 2'-deoxycytidine in human plasma and tissue by APCI tandem mass spectrometry.A fast, sensitive and accurate method for the determination of gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine; dFdC) and deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) in human plasma/tissue was developed using LC-MS/MS techniques. Effectiveness of the method is illustrated with the analysis of plasma from a phase I trial of dFdC administered as a 24h infusion. The method was developed using (15)N(3) CdR as an internal standard across the concentration range of 1-500ng/ml, using a cold alcohol-protein precipitation followed by desorption with freeze drying. Sample clean-up for LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by an innovative liquid/liquid back extraction with ethyl acetate and water. Chromatography was performed using a Chrompak-spherisorb-phenyl-column (3.1mmx200mm, 5microm) with a 50mM formic acid: acetonitrile (9:1) mobile phase eluted at 1ml/min. Extracted samples were observed to be stable for a minimum of 48h after extraction when kept at 4 degrees C. Detection was performed using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source and mass spectrometric positive multi-reaction-monitoring-mode (+MRM) for dFdC (264 m/z; 112 m/z), CdR (228 m/z; 112 m/z), and (15)N(3) CdR (231 m/z; 115 m/z) at an ion voltage of +3500V. The accuracy, precision and limit-of-quantitation (LOQ) were as follows: dFdC: 99.8%, +/-7.9%, 19nM; CdR: 100.0%, +/-5.3%, 22nM, linear range LOQ to 2microM. During 24h infusion dFdC levels were detected with no interference from either CdR or difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU). CdR co-eluted with dFdC but selectivity demonstrated no  crosstalk  between the compounds. In conclusion the analytical assay was very sensitive, reliable and robust for the determination of plasma and tissue concentrations of dFdC and CdR.",M1
16227400,"Comparison of biological effects of non-nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitors versus 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.DNA cytosine methylation plays a considerable role in normal development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. Hypermethylation of the promoters of some tumor suppressor genes and the associated silencing of these genes often occur in certain cancer types. The reversal of this process by DNA methylation inhibitors is a promising new strategy for cancer therapy. In addition to the four well-characterized nucleoside analogue methylation inhibitors, 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-<e>CdR</e>), 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, and zebularine, there is a growing list of non-nucleoside inhibitors. However, a systemic study comparing these potential demethylating agents has not been done. In this study, we examined three non-nucleoside demethylating agents, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, hydralazine, and procainamide, and compared their effects and potencies with 5-Aza-CdR, the most potent DNA methylation inhibitor. We found that 5-Aza-CdR is far more effective in DNA methylation inhibition as well as in reactivating genes, compared with non-nucleoside inhibitors.",M1
15637593,"Growth delay of human pancreatic cancer cells by methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment is associated with activation of the interferon signalling pathway.Alteration of methylation status has been recognized as a possible epigenetic mechanism of selection during tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer. This type of cancer is characterized by poor prognosis partly due to resistance to conventional drug treatments. We have used microarray technology to investigate the changes in global gene expression observed after treatment of different pancreatic cancer cell lines with the methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-<e>CdR</e>). We have observed that this agent is able to inhibit to various degrees the growth of three pancreatic cancer cell lines. In particular, this inhibition was associated with induction of interferon (IFN)-related genes, as observed in other tumour types. Thus, expression of STAT1 seems to play a key role in the cellular response to treatment with the cytosine analogue. Moreover, we found increased p21(WAF1) and gadd45A expression to be associated with the efficacy of the treatment; this induction may correlate with activation of the IFN signalling pathway. Expression of the p16(INK) protein was also linked to the ability of cells to respond to 5-aza-CdR. Finally, genome-wide demethylation induced sensitization that significantly increased response to further treatment with various chemotherapy agents.",M1
15634569,"[Combination of phenylbutyrate and 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine inhibits human Kasumi-1 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice.]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tumor suppression efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitor, phenylbutyrate (PB), in combination with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-<e>CdR</e>) in the treatment of Kasumi-1 xenograft tumor in nude mice and its mechanism. METHODS: The nude mice model of Kasumi-1 xenograft tumor was established by subcutaneous inoculation. Latency of tumor formation, the ability of Kasumi-1 cells pre treated with PB to form the xenograft tumor, and the tumor suppression activity of PB and 5-Aza-CdR by intraperitoneal injection in xenografted mice model were detected. Cell differentiation and cell cycle parameters of the tumor cells were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis, apoptosis by TUNEL in situ hybridization, and tumor microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry study. RESULTS: The latency of tumor formation in mice with or without previous lienectomy was 17 approximately 23 and 40 approximately 50 days, respectively. Tumor cells xenografted could not be found in other tissues than in inoculation area, and still harbored the specific t(8;21) and AML1-ETO fusion gene. When the xenografted mice models treated with PB, 5-Aza-CdR, or both, the tumor growth inhibition rates were 49.07%, 25.69% and 87.46% (P &lt; 0.05), the apoptosis indexes (AI) of tumor cells were (2.25 +/- 0.85)%, (1.32 +/- 0.68)%, and (5.41 +/- 1.56)% (P &lt; 0.05), and the microvessel densities (MVD) were 21.69 +/- 6.25, 28.34 +/- 4.24 and 9.48 +/- 3.21 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. All the data above were significantly different from that in control (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of CD11b and CD13 antigen of the tumor cells was increased in xenografted mice model treated with PB when compared with the control \[(12.08 +/- 1.02)% and (54.91 +/- 2.72)%\], respectively (P &lt; 0.01), and tumor cells showed a cell cycle arrest with increased G(0)/G(1)-phase cells and decreased S-phase cells. CONCLUSION: PB inhibited the growth of Kasumi-1 xenograft tumor by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and differentiation, and suppressing its angiogenesis in vivo. 5-Aza-CdR could significantly enhance the antitumor activity of PB.",M1
12054682,"Cytotoxic activity of 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and cytosine arabinoside in cells transduced with deoxycytidine kinase gene.Deoxycytidine nucleoside analogs must be first phosphorylated to become active anticancer drugs. The rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway is deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). Cells deficient in this enzyme are resistant to these analogs. To evaluate the potential of dCK to be used as suicide gene for deoxycytidine nucleoside analogs, we transduced both human A-549 lung carcinoma and murine NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines with this gene. The dCK-transduced cells showed an increase in cytotoxicity to the analogs, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-<e>CdR</e>). Unexpectedly, the related analog, 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC), was less cytotoxic to the dCK-transduced cells than the wild-type cells. For the A-549-dCK cells, the phosphorylation of dFdC by dCK was much greater than control cells. In accord with the elevated enzyme activity, we observed a 6-fold increased dFdC incorporation into DNA and a more pronounced inhibition of DNA synthesis in the A-549-dCK cells. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism of dFdC, we investigated its action on A549 and 3T3 cells transduced with both cytidine deaminase (CD) and dCK. We reported previously that overexpression of CD confers drug resistance to deoxycytidine analogs. In this study, when the CD-transduced cells were also transduced with dCK they became relatively more sensitive to dFdC. In addition, we observed that dFdU, the deaminated form of dFdC, was cytotoxic to the A-549-dCK cells, but not the wild-type cells. Our working hypothesis to explain these results is that the mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2), an enzyme reported to phosphorylate dFdC, acts as an important modulator of dFdC-induced cell toxicity. These findings may further clarify the action of dFdC and the mechanism by which it induces cell death.",M1
11593336,"Selection of drug-resistant transduced cells with cytosine nucleoside analogs using the human cytidine deaminase gene.Hematopoietic toxicity produced by most anticancer drugs limits their potential for curative therapy. We have shown previously that the human cytidine deaminase (CD) gene can confer drug resistance in murine bone marrow cells (BMCs) to the nucleoside analog, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). In the present study, as the first objective we showed that the CD gene can also render drug resistance in BMCs to related analogs, 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) and 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-AZA-<e>CdR</e>). As a second objective, we investigated the potential of ex vivo selection with cytosine nucleoside analogs of CD-transduced BMC. The goal of this approach was to enrich the fraction of CD-transduced BMCs so as to increase the transgene expression and level of drug resistance before transplantation. This strategy may have the potential to circumvent the problem in clinical gene therapy of low level of gene transfer and adequate long-term gene expression. Using a bicistronic retroviral vector containing the CD and the green fluorescent protein (CDiGFP), we transduced murine L1210 leukemic cells. All three analogs, ARA-C, dFdC, and 5-AZA-CdR were demonstrated in vitro to enrich (&gt;95%) the population of leukemic cells expressing the GFP transgene. However, with CD-transduced primary murine BMCs cultivated at high cell density we observed that in vitro selection with ARA-C was not possible due to release of CD into the culture medium at amounts that were sufficient to inactivate the analog. The CD-containing medium produced a chemoprotective effect on mock BMCs as shown by lack of significant growth inhibition in the presence of ARA-C. However, at low cell density in a cell mixture containing CD-transduced cells, the mock BMCs showed marked drug sensitivity to ARA-C as determined by clonogenic assay. Selection with ARA-C was shown to significantly increase the CD enzyme activity in transduced BMC. These results suggest that CD gene has the potential to be a good selectable marker and a possible tool for chemoprotection in cancer gene therapy.",M1
11473545,"Activation of the maternally preset program of apoptosis by microinjection of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate in Xenopus laevis embryos.The present study examines the effects on embryogenesis of microinjecting Xenopus laevis fertilized eggs with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-<e>CdR</e>), which induces hypomethylation of DNA, and 5-methyl-2'- deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate (5-methyl-dCTP), which induces hypermethylation of DNA. Embryos injected with either one of these analogs cleaved normally until the mid-blastula stage, but underwent massive cell dissociation and stopped development at the early gastrula stage. Dissociated cells that appeared here were positive by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end-labeling and contained fragmented nuclei with condensed chromatin. The DNA from these cells formed a  ladder  on electrophoresis. Furthermore, the induction of cell dissociation by 5-Aza-CdR and 5-methyl-dCTP was postponed by 2-3 h by co-injection of Bcl-2 mRNA and the normal metabolite (CdR and dCTP, respectively). Using a specific antibody against 5-methyl-cytosine, we confirmed that 5-Aza-CdR induces hypomethylation, whereas 5-methyl-dCTP induces hypermethylation in X. laevis embryos before the onset of cell dissociation. Incorporation of radioactive precursors revealed that synthesis of DNA, and also RNA, is inhibited significantly in both 5-Aza-CdR-injected and 5-methyl-dCTP-injected embryos. These results show that 5-Aza-CdR and 5-methyl-dCTP are incorporated into DNA and induce apoptosis, probably through alteration of DNA methylation coupled with inhibition of DNA replication and/or transcription.",M1
10825758,"Free radical formation in X-irradiated crystals of 2'-deoxycytidine hydrochloride. Electron magnetic resonance studies at 10 K.Single crystals of deoxycytidine hydrochloride (<e>CdR</e>.HCl) have been X-irradiated at 10 K with doses up to about 150 kGy and studied using 24 GHz (K-band) EPR, ENDOR and FSE spectroscopy. In this system, the cytosine base is protonated at the N3 position. Nine different radicals were characterized and identified. Three of these are ascribed to three versions of the one-electron reduced species, probably differing in their protonation state. Radicals formed by net hydrogen addition to the cytosine C5 and C6 positions were observed at 10 K. The hydrogen-abstraction radical at the deoxyribose C1' position most probably results from initial oxidation of the base. The remaining radical species are all localized to the sugar moiety, representing products formed by net hydrogen abstraction from three of the five available carbons of the deoxyribose sugar. The lack of base-centered oxidation products as well as the structures of the one-electron reduced species is rationalized by considering the specific proton donor-acceptor properties of this crystalline lattice in comparison with similar systems.",M1
9771951,"Drug resistance to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, and cytosine arabinoside conferred by retroviral-mediated transfer of human cytidine deaminase cDNA into murine cells.PURPOSE: The hematopoietic toxicity produced by the cytosine nucleoside analogs is a critical problem that limits their effectiveness in cancer therapy. One strategy to prevent this dose-limiting toxicity would be to insert a gene for drug resistance to these analogs into normal bone marrow cells. Cytidine (CR) deaminase can deaminate and thus inactivate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-<e>CdR</e>), 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The aim of this study was to determine if gene transfer of CR deaminase into murine fibroblast cells confers drug resistance to these cytosine nucleoside analogs and if this resistance can be prevented by the CR deaminase inhibitor, 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine (THU). METHODS: NIH 3T3 murine fibroblast cells were transduced with retroviral particles containing the human CR deaminase cDNA. Assays measuring CR deaminase activity as well as the inhibitory action of 5-AZA-CdR, dFdC and ARA-C on colony formation, were performed in the presence of different concentrations of THU. RESULTS: Retroviral-mediated transfer of the CR deaminase gene into 3T3 fibroblasts produced a considerable increase in CR deaminase activity. The transduced cells also showed significant drug resistance to 5-AZA-CdR, dFdC and ARA-C, as demonstrated by a clonogenic assay. This drug resistance phenotype and elevated CR deaminase activity were reversed by THU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the CR deaminase gene can potentially be used in cancer gene therapy for protecting normal cells against the cytotoxic actions of different cytosine nucleoside analogs. In addition, the CR deaminase-transduced cells can be used as a model for screening different CR deaminase inhibitors in an intact cellular system.",M1
9299594,"Nucleoside-mediated mitigation of 5-fluorouracil-induced toxicity in synchronized murine erythroleukemic cells.5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent known to retard embryonic growth and induce cleft palate and limb deformities. The predominant mechanism underlying its toxic action is thought to be inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (TS), and hence thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) synthesis, resulting in alteration of the balance of deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and disruption of DNA synthesis. Indeed, previously we demonstrated retarded cell-cycle progression concurrent with a 60% decrease in TS activity in rat whole embryos following maternal exposure to 40 mg/kg 5-FU on Gestational Day 14 and in the murine erythroleukemic cell (MELC) suspension culture following exposure to 5-25 microM 5-FU for 2 hr. In the study described herein, we used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to demonstrate in both of these model systems that 5-FU exposure results in similar patterns of dNTP perturbations: a prolonged decrease in dTTP and dGTP levels and an increase in dCTP and dATP. In addition, we used centrifugal elutriation to synchronize MELC in the phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1 and early S) most sensitive to 5-FU to investigate the ability of nucleoside supplementation to mitigate 5-FU-induced toxicity. Our data indicate that following a 2-hr exposure to 5-25 microM 5-FU, supplementation with 1-10 microM thymidine (TdR) for 24 hr partially reverses 5-FU-induced toxicity as evidenced by increased cellular proliferation and cell-cycle progression and amelioration of 5-FU-induced perturbations of protein synthesis and cellular membrane permeability compared to unsupplemented 5-FU-exposed cells. However, TdR concentrations &gt;/=100 microM inhibited growth or were cytotoxic. In comparison, supplementation with 10 microM-10 mM of deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) was not toxic, but effected a dose-dependent recovery from 5-FU-induced toxicity. At 1-100 microM, neither deoxyadenosine nor deoxyguanosine supplementation reduced 5-FU-induced toxicity; at higher concentrations, both purine nucleotides inhibited cell growth. Although these results support the hypothesis that 5-FU disrupts the MELC cell cycle by depleting dTTP (a perturbation that is reversible by TdR supplementation), they also indicate that CdR supplementation offers an additional recovery pathway.",M1
7874067,"Reaction of malondialdehyde with deoxyribonucleosides in the presence of acetaldehyde.The reactivity of malondialdehyde (MDA) with deoxyribonucleosides in the presence of acetaldehyde (AA) was investigated. Although MDA is known to be reactive towards deoxyguanosine (GdR), deoxyadenosine (AdR) and deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) under acidic conditions, MDA had only slight reactivity towards GdR under physiological pH. However, when AA was present, MDA exhibited much higher reactivity towards GdR, and a reaction with AdR also took place.",M1
7507741,"Antiproliferative effects and DNA hypomethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in human neuroblastoma cell lines.5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-<e>CdR</e>) is an inhibitor of DNA methylation, and its antileukemic activity has been shown in preclinical and clinical studies. This paper describes the ability of 5-AZA-CdR to inhibit DNA methylation, DNA synthesis and cell growth in several human neuroblastoma cell lines. The stability of cell growth inhibition was ascertained, as well as the ability of the metabolite thymidine to enhance the antiproliferative effect of 5-AZA-CdR. The activity of phosphorylating enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was correlated to different levels of sensitivity in several cell lines. The results obtained indicate that 5-AZA-CdR may be an agent for the chemotherapy of neuroblastoma.",M1
8343176,"Deoxyribocytidine is salvaged not only into DNA but also into phospholipid precursors. IV. Exogenous deoxyribocytidine can be used with the same efficacy as (ribo)cytidine for lipid activation.Utilisation of exogenous (ribo)cytidine (3H-CR) and deoxyribocytidine (3H-<e>CdR</e>) for DNA/RNA synthesis and for activation of phospholipid intermediates was compared in human tonsillar lymphocytes. Incorporation of 3H-CdR into dCDP-choline and into dCDP-DAG was similar or even higher than labelling of CDP-choline and CDP-DAG from 3H-CR. No interconversion was found between CDP-DAG and dCDP-DAG, as shown by TLC separation of the ribo- and deoxyribocytidine derivatives. Moreover, a strict separation was found between the salvage pathways of deoxyribocytidine and (ribo)cytidine, as 4000-fold excess of non labelled (ribo)cytidine did not show any specific effect on 3H-dCDP-DAG labelling from exogenous 3H-CdR.",M1
7687437,"Nutritional and hormonal regulation of liver deoxycytidine kinase activity.Administration of <e>CdR</e> (50 mg/100 g every 12 h) elevated hepatic CdR kinase (EC 2.7.1.74) activity in normal or adrenalectomized rats over the control values 2- to 2.7-fold. Actinomycin (5 micrograms/100 g) or cycloheximide (50 micrograms/100 g) blocked the increase in enzyme activity. In starved rats, liver CdR kinase decreased to 64% compared to fed controls; refeeding restored enzyme activity to normal range. Steroid treatment (triamcinolone 1 mg/100 g/day) elevated liver CdR kinase activity to 138%, 169% and 193% of controls in 1, 2 and 3 days, respectively. Actinomycin or cycloheximide prevented this rise. These data suggest that the substrate and steroid induction of hepatic CdR kinase activity may be due to increased mRNA production and enhanced protein biosynthesis.",M1
8503910,"The salvage of deoxycytidine into dCDP-diacylglycerol by macrophages and lymphocytes.Extracellular deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) was previously shown to be salvaged into water soluble [1] and also into lipidic [2] precursors of phospholipids in stimulated lymphocytes and in lymphoma cells [3]. In this paper we have described that non-dividing murine macrophages salvaged not only 5-3H-CdR but also tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) mainly into the pools as nucleotides. Chlorpromazine shifted the CdR salvage into a lipidic compound of the cells which was identified as 3H-dCDP-diacylglycerol (dCDP-DAG). After 5-3H-CdR labeling the lipid/DNA ratio was eleven times higher in macrophages than in tonsillar lymphocytes. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on borate impregnated silica gel plates gave clear separation of CDP-DAG from dCDP-DAG supporting that the extracellular precursor for it is exclusively deoxycytidine and not ribocytidine. No interconversion between deoxy- and and ribocytidine could be observed neither in lymphocytes nor in macrophages.",M1
8494545,"Kinetic studies on 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) with purified human deoxycytidine kinase and cytidine deaminase.Phosphorylation of cytosine analogs by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deamination by cytidine deaminase (CDA) are two important processes in the activation and elimination of these drugs. We have investigated the kinetic parameters of 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) using purified enzymes from human cells. Deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) and dFdC had Km values of 1.5 and 4.6 microM for dCK, respectively. Feedback inhibition of dCK by deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) was also studied. Our results show that dCTP produced a greater inhibition of the phosphorylation of dFdC than CdR with concentrations of dCTP ranging from 1 to 25 microM. dFdC was a good substrate for CDA. Kinetic studies with this enzyme gave Km values for CdR and dFdC of 46.3 and 95.7 microM, respectively. The effect of competitive inhibitors of CDA on the deamination of dFdC was also investigated. Diazepinone riboside was a more potent inhibitor than tetrahydrouridine using either CdR or dFdC as the substrate. Inhibitors of CDA could be useful in clinical trials in patients with cancer to increase the chemotherapeutic effectiveness of dFdC.",M1
8305745,"Deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase activities in rat brain.Deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.74) acts as a salvage enzyme in DNA biosynthesis, but little is known about this important nucleoside kinase in the brain. We report that CdR kinase activity in the 100,000 x g cytosolic fraction of normal adult rat brain cortex was 0.89 +/- 0.04 nmol/hr/mg protein which is twice that of the liver enzyme. For brain CdR kinase the apparent Km for CdR, ATP and Mg++ were 0.22, 1.1 and 0.63 mM, respectively. When the cytosolic preparation was incubated at 37 degrees C, CdR kinase activity rapidly decreased (t1/2 = 15 min); CdR (400 microM) protected the enzyme. Addition of DFDC (0 to 100 microM) competitively inhibited brain CdR kinase activity with Ki = 17 microM. DFDC elevated the apparent Km for CdR of brain CdR kinase 3.5-fold, from 0.22 to 0.8 mM. DFDC did not inhibit brain TdR kinase. AZT, which competitively inhibited TdR kinase (Ki = 0.6 microM), did not affect brain CdR kinase activity. These results indicate that the cytosol of rat brain contains CdR kinase which is inhibited by the deoxycytidine analog, DFDC. The enzyme is protected from thermal denaturation by CdR but not by TdR.",M1
1551421,"Compartmentation of dCTP pools disappears after hydroxyurea or araC treatment in lymphocytes.The calculated rate of DNA synthesis using [5-3H]TdR was about 4 times higher than in the case of [5-3H]<e>CdR</e> labeling, even after correction for the specific radioactivities of the intracellular pools. These data show a compartmentation of dCTP pools in lymphocytes. Hydroxyurea increased the specific activities of both dTTP and dCTP pools so that the calculated rate of DNA synthesis became equal. The same effect was found for araC treatment, but not for fluorodeoxyuridine. dCTP was supplied from CTP which is the lowest ribonucleotide pool in lymphocytes. Different functions of the two dCTP pools are proposed: one serving DNA replication; the other one supplies phospholipid precursors and DNA repair.",M1
1993063,"Deoxycytidine is salvaged not only into DNA but also into phospholipid precursors. III. dCOP-diacylglycerol formation in tonsillar lymphocytes.In addition to the water-soluble deoxyliponucleotides (Spasokukotskaja et al. (1988), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 155, 923), a lipid compound was shown to be labeled from external 3H-deoxycytidine (5-3H-<e>CdR</e>) in infant tonsillar lymphocytes. Chlorpromazine enhanced the labeling of this compound, identified by TLC as 3H-dCDP-diacylglycerol (3H-dCOP-DAG). The deoxynucleotide salvage pathway seems to be the main source for dCDP-DAG synthesis, as hydroxyurea increased its labeling from CdR. myo-Inositol induced the disappearance of 5-3H-dCOP-DAG, suggesting its utilization for phosphatidylinositol synthesis. 3H-Arabinosyl-Cytosine (araC) is also incorporated into the lipidic fraction at a rate comparable to its incorporation into DNA, supporting the effect of araC on membrane functions.",M1
2777335,"Follicular cells of tonsils metabolise more deoxycytidine than other cell populations.Nine subpopulations of tonsillar lymphocytes and the unseparated cells were compared in their utilization of exogenous deoxycytidine ([5-3H]<e>CdR</e>) and thymidine ([3H]TdR). Uptake phosphorylation and incorporation of labeled precursors were determined in B and T lymphocytes, in low density (LD; enriched in S phase cells) and in high density (HD; enriched in G0/G1 phase cells) cell fractions as well as in LD and HD subfractions of B and T lymphocytes, and in cells isolated from follicles of tonsils. As expected, LD cells and B lymphocytes were more active in TdR incorporation than HD cells and T lymphocytes. However, the ratio of [5-3H]CdR to [3H]TdR in their total phosphorylation and incorporation into DNA was much lower than the expected value of 1: about 0.5 for total phosphorylation and about 0.3 for incorporation in all subpopulations, except for the follicular cells, where these ratios were 1.0 and 0.7, respectively. These results show that the relative utilization of the two pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside precursors varies among different lymphocyte subpopulations. However, this variation is not due to the different rate of DNA synthesis; rather, it depends on the differentiation stage of lymphocytes occurring in the germinal center of the follicles.",M1

The highest genetic effect per unit of activity of 3H-nucleosides (3H-TdR and 3H-<e>CdR</e>) was revealed at lowest activities.

3393160,"Modulation of DNA precursor pools, DNA synthesis, and ultraviolet sensitivity of a repair-deficient CHO cell line by deoxycytidine.The presence of 2 mM deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) in growth medium substantially increased the deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pools in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO-K1, and in a radiation-sensitive mutant, xrs-5, derived from it (Jeggo et al., 1982). We observed significant differences in alkaline-sucrose gradient profiles of pulse-labeled DNA from unirradiated CHO-K1 and xrs-5 cells. For the latter cell line, a sizable fraction of the DNA synthesized during 5 or 10 min of growth subsequent to a 5-min radiolabeling period was found to co-sediment with large-chromosome DNA. This characteristic of xrs-5 was dramatically reduced by the presence of 2 mM CdR in the culture medium, and the UV resistance of the mutant increased to nearly that of the parent cell line under these culture conditions. These results show that the locus conferring UV-radiation sensitivity to xrs-5 affects DNA replication and that replicative activity and UV-radiation sensitivity are jointly modulated by CdR, possibly through its impact on the size of deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools.",M1

It was found that about 70% of <e>CdR</e> was deaminated and converted into dTMP. The cells were very sensitive to araC, but the incorporation of [14C] CdR was twice more sensitive to araC than that of [5-3H]CdR. This effect can be explained by the interconversion of araC into araT nucleotide via the CdR interconversion pathway. This suggestion was also supported by the effect of 5-F-UdR, which decreased the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by araC. 5-FUdR the inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, possibly decreases the interconversion of araC into araTTP, and its action via a smaller dTTP pool of the cells. Our data suggest, that the sensitivity of cells to araC may depend on the capacity of the CdR----TdR interconversion pathway, which, however, changes during the normal differentiation process of lymphocytes. Thus, the sensitivity of different malignant cells to araC is determined by the differentiation stage at which they were arrested during cell transformation.",M1
3500854,"Modulation of induced reversion frequency by nucleotide pool imbalance as a tool for mutant characterization.Addition of thymidine (TdR) or deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) to the culture medium during posttreatment incubation affected the frequency of mutagen-induced reversion in three hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient mutants of V79 Chinese hamster cells. With two of the mutants (E20 and I3), reversions induced by N-ethylnitrosourea, ethyl methanesulfonate, and methyl methanesulfonate were enhanced by TdR and were either decreased (E20) or not affected (I3) by CdR. With the third mutant (E21), alkylating agent-induced reversions were enhanced by CdR and decreased by TdR. Finally, 6-amino-2-hydroxypurine induced reversions were enhanced by TdR in mutant I3 and were decreased by TdR or deoxyadenosine (AdR) and enhanced by CdR in mutant E21. An attempt was made to reconcile these results with simple mutation mechanisms, based on either G:C to A:T or A:T to G:C transitions. It is suggested that the present approach may add useful information to studies of specific revertibility of mammalian cell mutants with known mutagens.",M1

6231047,"Mechanisms of deoxyadenosine toxicity in human lymphoid cells in vitro: relevance to the therapeutic use of inhibitors of adenosine deaminase.Deoxyadenosine (AdR) appears to be central to the molecular events mediating immunodeficiency in children born with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency but it is still uncertain whether lymphotoxicity is due to AdR directly inhibiting transmethylation reactions in which S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl group donor, or is due to phosphorylation of AdR to deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) which then inhibits ribonucleotide reductase or is due to other mechanisms. Using AdR and the ADA inhibitor deoxycoformycin (dCF) and assessing cell viability, nucleoside incorporation into RNA and DNA, as well as measuring deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase activity, we have studied various types of human lymphoid cells and demonstrated in them the relative importance of the above two mechanisms of AdR toxicity. Treatment of normal resting peripheral blood lymphocytes in culture with AdR and dCF resulted in impaired viability. Although elevated dATP levels as well as decreased SAH hydrolase activities were both observed, the failure of a known inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (hydroxyurea) to produce toxicity, and the inability of deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) to achieve a rescue effect, point to another mechanism, possibly inhibition of trans-methylation or ATP depletion being the more likely causes of toxicity in resting lymphocytes. The same mechanism may well account for the rapid and severe lymphopenia in patients treated with dCF. On the other hand, in cultured lymphoblasts in the exponential phase of growth. AdR and dCF produced marked inhibition of growth and cell death both in a Thy-ALL line and in a c-ALL line, in the absence of significant inhibition of SAH hydrolase, but with a substantial elevation in dATP concentrations and depressed levels of the other dNTP. Minor toxicity occurred in a proliferating B lymphoblast line despite almost complete inactivation of SAH hydrolase. These observations indicate inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase as the more likely mechanism of toxicity in rapidly proliferating lymphocytes. Other T-cells actively synthesizing DNA, such as PHA-stimulated or MLC activated lymphocytes and T-lymphoid colony forming cells, are also likely to be affected by the same mechanism. Indeed in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, deoxycytidine caused significant although incomplete rescue from toxicity due to dCF and AdR. In patients with ADA deficiency or treated with ADA inhibitors, both mechanisms could be operative. These observations are also relevant to the possible use of dCF and AdR as immunosuppressive agents and for the removal of T-cells or residual Thy-ALL blasts from bone marr",M1
6627345,"Factors modifying the synergistic toxicity of deoxycytidine in combination with thymidine plus 5-fluorouracil in HeLa cells.We reported previously that deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) enhances the cytotoxic effects of the drug combination thymidine (TdR) plus 5-fluorouracil (FUra) against HeLa S-3 cells. We have now examined the relationships between the concentration of CdR and its cytotoxic and cytokinetic effects, and have also investigated the role of certain other components of the culture medium in this phenomenon. Cell survival was determined by a colony-forming assay; cytokinetic effects were monitored by flow cytometry. In the initial experiments, cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium and exposed for 22 hr to 4 mM TdR, 0 X 025 mM FUra, and dCyd ranging from 1 microM to 4 X 0 mM. The individual drugs were at most only slightly toxic under these conditions; for TdR plus FUra, the survival decreased to 50% (in 5% FCS), and in the three-drug combination it varied from 8% at 1 microM CdR to 28% at 0 X 10 mM and back to a low of 3% at 4 X 0 mM CdR. Results from flow cytometry appeared correlated with the survival data, in that cells accumulated in the S phase to a greater extent in the region around 0 X 10 mM CdR than at higher or lower concentrations. When cells were exposed to the drugs in MEM medium in place of F12, their sensitivity to FUra and the TdR-FUra combination was enhanced, although the additional synergistic effect of CdR was reduced. We found that hypoxanthine, present in F12 but not in MEM, was the principal compound responsible for the observed differences between media.",M1
6605195,"Quantitative study of deoxycytidine incorporation in large and small lymphocytes of the mouse.Using radioautographic smear preparations of thymocytes and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells labelled with three different tritiated pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides, the incorporation of DNA precursors was studied separately on large lymphocytes and small lymphocytes. Radioautographic reaction due to generally tritiated deoxycytidine ( [G-3H]<e>CdR</e>) labelling in vivo in large lymphocytes was more intense than that in small lymphocytes. When mice were sacrificed 6 hr after the administration of tritiated thymidine ( [3H]TdR), small lymphocytes were labelled more heavily than large lymphocytes. However, labelling intensity with [3H]TdR in large lymphocytes was greatly enhanced by the administration of 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine, whereas in small lymphocytes labelling intensity was only fairly enhanced by the same treatment. When cells were incubated in vitro with 5-tritium labelled deoxycytidine [( 5-3H]CdR) for 10 min, there was no significant difference in labelling intensities between large and small lymphocytes. In the case of [G-3H]CdR incorporation, the labelling intensity in large lymphocytes was found to be significantly stronger than that in small lymphocytes. Large as well as small lymphocytes incorporated [3H]TdR very well in vitro. However, addition of 5 X 0 X 10(-5) M of non-radioactive CdR to the medium greatly decreased the incorporation of [3H]TdR by large lymphocytes, whereas the effect of non-radioactive CdR in small lymphocytes was not so marked as that in large lymphocytes. Furthermore, the [3H]TdR-labelling percentages were decreased at the same rate by the addition of non-radioactive CdR in both large and small lymphocytes. These results indicate that large lymphocytes and a proportion of small lymphocytes have a strong tendency to convert CdR to thymidine mono-phosphate, which is utilized for DNA synthesis, whereas this ability is relatively weak in the rest of small lymphocytes. Thus, it is probably that this metabolic ability changes during the transition of the large lymphocyte to the small lymphocyte.",M1
7273018,"Rescue of thymidine cytotoxicity in L1210 ascites by elevated endogenous levels of deoxycytidine.Although the biochemical and cytokinetic effects of thymidine (TdR) have been extensively studied in vitro, other parameters may be encountered in vivo that could alter its therapeutic efficacy. L1210 cells in culture are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TdR, while TdR infusions in mice bearing L1210 ascites fail to prolong survival. Our results demonstrate that the TdR levels achieved in the serum and ascites fluid during sc and iv infusions range between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M. These levels are sufficient to inhibit the growth of bone marrow and intestinal mucosa cells, as evidenced by 32P incorporation studies. However, these TdR levels fail to exhibit the growth of L1210 ascites, despite the fact that these cells are sensitive to similar concentrations in vitro. The absence of growth inhibition in the L1210 ascites is shown to be due to increased endogenous <e>CdR</e> levels (approximately 2 X 10(-5) M) in the ascites fluid. The concomitant serum CdR levels were at least ten times lower than those achieved in the ascites. This factor probably accounts for the differential effect of TdR on normal cells as compared in vivo with agents such as TdR or even antimetabolites, such as cytarabine, may be modulated by increased CdR levels in the local tumor milieu. These studies are relevant in that TdR is currently being used in a variety of clinical protocols using the nucleoside alone at high doses or in combination with methotrexate, 5-FU, or cytarabine.",M1

Comparing the ratios between Ara-C and CdR phosphorylation it was revealed that these were twice as high in CML cells as in normal leucocytes, whereas no difference was found when comparing ratios between Ara-C and CdR deamination. From these discoveries it is proposed that Ara-C can be combined with CdR with advantage, because apparently CdR protects the normal cells more than the malignant ones.",M1

However, advanced lethal toxicity that developed at the same time resulted in the death of mice. Simultaneous administration of araC and deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) per os in doses 3 times as high as doses of araC decreased the antitumor and toxic effects of araC.

7428016,"Different labelling patterns in mouse lymphoid tissues with [3H]deoxycytidine and [3H]thymidine.The percentages of labelled lymphocytes in smear preparations of mouse thymus were higher than those in similar preparations of mesenteric lymph nodes with either generally labelled tritiated deoxycytidine, [3H]<e>CdR</e>, or tritiated thymidine, [3H]TdR. Lymphocytes in the thymus cortex and in germinal centres of mesenteric lymph nodes were intensely labelled with [3H]CdR, whereas with [3H]TdR lymphocytes in the peripheral region of thymus and medullary cords of mesenteric lymph nodes were heavily labelled. The majority of lymphocytes in thymic cortex and germinal centres of mesenteric lymph nodes were labelled weakly with [3H]TdR. Thus, labelling patterns with [3H]CdR differed from those with [3H]TdR in lymphoid tissues of the mouse. Mouse lymphocytes can utilize [3H]CdR as a precursor molecule for cytosine and thymine in DNA. The ratio of radioactivity of thymine to that of cytosine was measured biochemically in DNA extracted from lymphocytes labelled with [3H]CdR. This radioativity ratio in thymus was higher than that in mesenteric lymph nodes. These results suggest that the metabolic activities of utilizing CdR for DNA synthesis differ within lymphocyte populations in various lymphoid tissues in the mouse.",M1
6156004,"Cellular differentiation, cytidine analogs and DNA methylation.The nucleoside analog 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) induced marked changes in the differentiated state of cultured mouse embryo cells and also inhibited the methylation of newly synthesized DNA. The DNA strand containing 5-aza-CR remained undermethylated in the round of DNA synthesis following analog incorporation. The extent of inhibition of DNA modification and induction of muscle cells in treated cultures were dependent on the 5-aza-CR concentration over a narrow dose range. Experiments with the restriction enzyme Hpa II, which is sensitive to cytosine methylation in the sequence CCGG, demonstrated that the DNA synthesized in 5-aza-CR-treated cultures was maximally undermethylated 48 hr after treatment. Three other analogs of cytidine, containing a modification in the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring [5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine(5-aza-<e>CdR</e>), pseudoisocytidine (psi ICR) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine(FCdR)] also induced the formation of muscle cells and inhibited DNA methylation. In contrast, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR) did not inhibit DNA methylation or induce muscle formation, whereas 5-6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR) was a poor inducer of muscle cells and a poor inhibitor of DNA methylation. These results provide experimental evidence for a role for DNA modification in differentiation, and suggest that cytidine analogs containing an altered 5 position perturb previously established methylation patterns to yield new cellular phenotypes.",M1

The cytotoxicity of MNNG was increased 2-fold in the presence of Hx, and more than 10-fold in the presence of TdR. This cytotoxic effect of TdR was abolished by equal concentrations of CdR, which by itself did not increase the cytotoxicity of MNNG. However, the yield of MNNG-induced AzGr colonies was increased 2--10-fold in the presence of both CdR and TdR. The AzGr colonies displayed phenotypes characteristic of hypoxanthine: guaninephosphoribosyltransferase-deficient (HGPRT-) mutants, or indicative of mutant HGPRT with altered substrate affinities. The nucleosides did not affect the growth or expression time of the HGPRT- mutants; the same extent of alkali-labile DNA damage occurred in cells treated with alkylating agents in the presence and absence of TdR and CdR; and the increase in mutation frequency in the presence of these nucleosides occurred not only with MNNG, but also with ethylating agents. Nucleosides treated with MNNG were not mutagenic, and treatment of the cells with TdR and CdR only prior to treatment with MNNG or only during selection with AzG did not increase the induced mutation frequency. Therefore, the interpretation is proposed that CdR, TdR and Hx produce nucleotide-pool imbalances that increase lethal and mutagenic errors of replication of alkylated DNA.",M1

Utilization of 3H-deoxycytidine as a DNA cytosine precursor]The incorporation of 3H-deoxycytidine (3H-<e>Cdr</e>) in the presence of thymidine (Tdr) into cultured human blood lymphocytes has been studied. The analysis of the label in interphase nuclei as well as in chromosomes at metaphase was carried out. The labeling was much higher when 3H-Cdr (0.5 to 1.0 C/ml, 2--4 x 10(-5) mM) was added to the cultures simultaneously with Tdr (4 x 10(-1) mM). This observation is considered as an indication that in the presence of high doses of Tdr exogeneous Cdr is utilized to synthesize cytosine of DNA rather than thymidine. During the first hours after its addition, the bulk of 3H-Cdr is eliminated from the culture medium. At 12 hrs of the incubation, the medium seems to be free of the nucleoside as shown particularly from the single chromatid localization of the label in chromosomes of the second mitosis. The incorporation into lymphocytes of 3H-Tdr administered in the same dose under the same conditions was registered for the whole period of observation (24 hrs).

The percentages of radioactively labeled small lymphocytes and their mean grain counts were determined. The percentages of radioactively labeled small lymphocytes after 3H-TdR and 3H-<e>CdR</e> showed no significant differences in both splenic zones. The grain counts over the lymphocyte nuclei in the periarteriolar zone showed lower values after 3H-TdR than after 3H-CdR. The lymphocytes in the perifollicular zone were strongly labeled with 3H-TdR and weakly labeled with 3H-CdR. In the thymus medulla, lymphocytes were weakly labeled with 3H-thymidine and strongly labeled with 3H-CdR. In the cortex no significant differences were observed. 75 to 80% of the small lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were weakly and 20-25% strongly labeled after 3H-TdR. Therefore there are similarities in the radioactive labeling pattern of thymic medulla lymphocytes and that of small lymphocytes of the periarteriolar zone of the spleen by both DNA precursors. The small lymphocytes in the peripheral T-dependent tissue zones, for example in the spleen, as well as in the mixed lymphocyte population of the peripheral blood can be differentiated from the B-lymphocytes through the difference in the amount of incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-deoxycytidine.",M1

The in vitro concentrations that produce 50% cell kill for 5-aza-CdR were about 1.0 and 0.01 microng/ml for a 2- and 24-hr exposure, respectively. 5-aza-CdR inhibited the growth of the fibrosarcoma cells by 40% at a concentration of 0.05 microng/ml.

At a concentration of 10 microng/ml, 5-aza-CdR stimulated the incorporation of radioactive thymidine into DNA by more than 50%.

1087352,"Dependency of sister chromatid exchange in T- and B-cells on the incorporation of deoxyribonucleosides into chromosomal DNA.Human T-cells (CCRF-HSB2) did not incorporate tritiated thymidine ([3H]TDR)--1.0-5.0 muCi/ml--into the nuclei, where.as they readily incorporated tritiated deoxycytidine (E13H]<e>CDR</e>). When contamination with pleuropneumonia-like organisms was ruled out, these findings strongly suggested a deficiency of the enzyme thymidine kinase in the cells. Human B-cells (CCRF-SB) and normal T-lymphocytes (NTL) readily incorporated [3H]CDR, [3H]TDR, and tritiated 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and they clearly exhibited differential staining of the sister chromatids (SCD). When nonisotopic bromodeoxyuridine (BUDR), 10(-6)-10(-4) M, was used with the B-cells and NTL, SCD were clearly evident and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was relatively infrequent; when the concentration was 10(-7) M, SCD staining was poor but the frequency of SCE was high. SCE frequencies in NTL, measured by autoradiography after incorporation of [3H]CDR, were the same as SCE frequencies measured by staining with BUDR at 10(-4) M. In the case of CCRF-HSB2, 10(-4) M BUDR produced relatively high frequencies of SCE as did 10(-7) M BUDR with the former two cells. However, [3H]CDR with CCRF-HSB2 gave relatively low frequencies of SCE, of the magnitude observed after 10(-4) M BUDR was used with NTL and the B-cells.

51655,"Deoxycytidine kinase: properties of the enzyme from human leukemic granulocytes.Deoxycytidine kinase, which phosphorylates deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) and its analog, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), has been purified 71-fold from human leukemic cells. Biochemical properties of the partially purified enzyme included a molecular weight of 68,000, Kms of 7.8 muM for CdR and 25.6 muM for ara-C, and optimal activity with ATP and GTP as phosphate donors. Ara-C phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by CdR (Ki = 0.17 muM) and dCTP (Ki = 7.3 muM) and was weakly inhibited by ara-CTP (Ki = 0.13 mM). Purification by calcium phosphate gel elution and DEAE chromatography effectively separated this enzyme from cytidine deaminase, which deaminates both CdR and ara-C, and from uridine-cytidine kinase, the enzyme which phosphorylates 5-azacytidine. CdR kinase activity was found to decrease and cytidine deaminase to increase with maturation of normal and leukemic granulocytes. Myeloblasts purified by Ficoll sedimentation revealed an average kinase activity of 15.4 U/mg protein in acute myelocytic leukemia and 12.3 U/mg protein in blastic crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). The average ratio of CdR kinase to deaminase activity in crude cell extracts varied from 0.197 in AML and 0.089 in blastic crisis to 0.0004 in normal granulocytes, reflecting the changes which take place with cellular maturation.

169387,"Mitochondrial and herpesvirus-specific deoxypyrimidine kinases.To characterize and compare the thymidine (TdR) and deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) kinase isozymes of uninfected and herpesvirus-infected cells: (i) the subcellular distribution of the isozymes has been studied; (ii) a specific assay for CdR kinase has been devised; (iii) the TdR kinase isozymes have been partially purified; and (iv) the purified enzymes have been analyzed by disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and glycerol gradient centrifugation and by substrate competition and dCTP inhibition studies. The results indicate that there are interesting individual differences with respect to nucleoside acceptor specificity between the cytosol and mitochondrial pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinases of uninfected cells and between the enzymes induced by different herpesviruses. In the cytosol of uninfected mouse, chicken, and owl monkey kidney cells, two different proteins, TdR kinase F and CdR kinase 2, catalyze the phosphorylations of TdR and CdR, respectively. TdR kinase F does not phosphorylate CdR, nor does CdR kinase 2 phosphorylate TdR. A second TdR kinase isozyme present in HeLa(BU25) mitochondria (TdR kinase B) also lacks CdR phosphorylating activity. In contrast, a genetically distinctive deoxypyrimidine kinase (TdR kinase A) of mouse, human, and chick mitochondria catalyzes the phosphorylation of both TdR and CdT. Three herpesviruses, marmoset herpesvirus and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, induce in the cytosol fraction of LM(TK-) mouse cells isozymes which share common properties with mitochondrial TdR kinase A, including the ability to catalyze the phosphorylation of both TdR and CdR. However, the herpesvirus-induced deoxypyrimidine kinases differ from mitochondrial TdR kinase A with respect to sedimentation coefficient, sensitivity to dCTP inhibition, and antigenic determinants. The herpesvirus-specific and the mitochondrial deoxypyrimidine kinases exhibit a preference for TdR over CdR as nucleoside acceptor. Pseudorabies virus and herpesvirus of turkeys induce cytosol TdR kinases resembling the other herpesvirus-induced TdR kinases in several properties, but like cellular TdR kinase F, the pseudorabies virus and herpesvirus of turkeys TdR kinases lack detectable CdR phosphorylating activities.

1081500,"Evaluation of radiochemical protectors using urinary deoxycytidine levels.It is customary to use the LD50 response as a criterion for the evaluation of chemical radioprotection. The increased urinary excretion of deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) in irradiated rats has been shown to be a linear dose--response relationship up to 200 R, thus making it possible to consider such a response as a criterion for chemical radioprotection evaluation at sub-lethal irradiation levels. Rats were subjected to 200 R X-irradiation with various chemical protectors and without chemical protectors, urine was collected 24 hours after irradiation, and the CdR levels in the urine analysed. A dose-reduction factor (DRF) was determined for 24-hour urinary excretions of CdR for chemically protected and non-protected rats. The DRF values are within 6 per cent of those reported by other investigators using LD50 as the response criterion for serotonin, cysteine, MEA and PAPP but differ for WR-2721 and WR-2823.

1120315,"Metabolism of deoxycytidine, thymine, and deoxythymidine in the hamster.The ability of growing and of mature Syrian hamsters to anabolize (to liver DNA) or catabolize (to 14CO2) graded amounts of [2-14C]deoxythymidine (TdR), thymine, or deoxycytidine (<e>CdR</e>) was measured in vivo. Of the three precursors, CdR labeled DNA most efficiently and, as expected, incorporation of all three into DNA was greater in younger animals. The catabolism of [2-14C]CdR to respired 14CO2 was dose dependent and showed no signs whatsoever of saturation, even with the highest dose (greater than 20 mumoles/g liver). In contrast, TdR and thymine were catabolized more slowly and saturation was approached with modest doses. The excretion of CdR in the urine was low and independent of dose, while excretion of TdR and thymine was greater and was dose dependent. Rats tested with an intermediate dose of CdR did not catabolize significant quantities to 14CO2, but did excrete considerably more [C]CdR into the urine than did hamsters. These and other findings suggest that, while the rat and the hamster metabolize thymine (and TdR as well) in a similar fashion, they metabolize CdR quite differently, probably because the hamster has a much higher level of nucleoside aminohydrolase which deaminates CdR and related compounds. Because the human also has a very high level of this enzyme, the hamster appears to be a superior animal model for the study of cytosine-containing compounds intended for human use.",M1

It was further found that 3H-CdR and 3H-TdR were incorporated to about the same extent. However, cells which were incubated with 131IUdR and 3H-TdR took up the 131IUdR to a lesser extent than cells which were incubated with 131IUdR and 3H-CdR.",M1
20147404,"Ablation of the complementarity-determining region H3 apex of the anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 abrogates neutralizing capacity without affecting core epitope binding.The identification and characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 has formed a major research focus, with the ultimate goal to help in the design of an effective AIDS vaccine. One of these bnAbs, 2F5, has been extensively characterized, and residues at the apex of its unusually long complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) H3 loop have been shown to be crucial for neutralization. Structural studies, however, have revealed that the (100)TLFGVPI(100F) apex residues of the CDR H3 loop do not interact directly with residues of its core gp41 epitope. In an attempt to gain better insight into the functional role of this element, we have recombinantly expressed native 2F5 Fab and two mutants in which either the apical Phe100B(H) residue was changed to an alanine or the CDR H3 residues (100)TLFGVPI(100F) were replaced by a Ser-Gly dipeptide linker. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and competitive-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) rendered strikingly similar affinity constants (K(d) [dissociation constant] of approximately 20 nM) for linear peptide epitope binding by 2F5 Fabs, independent of the presence or absence of the apex residues. Ablation of the CDR H3 apex residues, however, abolished the cell-cell fusion inhibition and pseudovirus neutralization capacities of 2F5 Fab. We report competitive ELISA data that suggest a role of 2F5 CDR H3 apex residues in mediating weak hydrophobic interactions with residues located at the C terminus of the gp41 membrane proximal external region and/or membrane components in the context of core epitope binding. The present data therefore imply an extended 2F5 paratope that includes weak secondary interactions that are crucial for neutralization of Env-mediated fusion.",M2
20065653,"Affinity maturation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 gp41.The human D5 monoclonal antibody binds to the highly conserved hydrophobic pocket on the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) trimer of HIV-1 gp41 and exhibits modest yet relatively broad neutralization activity. Both binding and neutralization depend on residues in the complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) of the D5 IgG variable domains on heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL). In an effort to increase neutralization activity to a wider range of HIV-1 strains, we have affinity matured the parental D5 scFv by randomizing selected residues in 5 of its 6 CDRs. The resulting scFv variants derived from four different CDR changes showed enhanced binding affinities to gp41 NHR mimetic (5-helix) which correlated to improved neutralization potencies by up to 8-fold. However, when converted to IgG1s, these D5 variants had up to a 12-fold reduction in neutralization potency over their corresponding scFvs despite their slightly enhanced in vitro binding affinities. Remarkably, D5 variant IgG1s bearing residue changes in CDRs that interact with epitope residues N-terminal to the hydrophobic pocket (such as VH CDR3 and VL CDR3) retained more neutralization potency than those containing residue changes in pocket-interacting CDRs (such as VH CDR2). These results provide compelling evidence for the existence of a steric block to an IgG that extends to the gp41 NHR hydrophobic pocket region, and can be a useful guide for developing therapeutic antibodies and vaccines circumventing this block.",M2
20046577,"Antibodies designed as effective cancer vaccines.Antigen/antibody complexes can efficiently target antigen presenting cells to allow stimulation of the cellular immune response. Due to the difficulty of manufacture and their inherent instability complexes have proved inefficient cancer vaccines. However, anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking antigens have been shown to stimulate both antibody and T cell responses. The latter are due to T cell mimotopes expressed within the complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) of antibodies that are efficiently presented to dendritic cells in vivo. Based on this observation we have designed a DNA vaccine platform called ImmunoBody, where cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T cell epitopes replace CDR regions within the framework of a human IgG1 antibody. The ImmunoBody expression system has a number of design features which allow for rapid production of a wide range of vaccines. The CDR regions of the heavy and light chain have been engineered to contain unique restriction endonuclease sites, which can be easily opened, and oligonucleotides encoding the T cell epitopes inserted. The variable and constant regions of the ImmunoBody are also flanked by restriction sites, which permit easy exchange of other IgG subtypes. Here we show a range of T cell epitopes can be inserted into the ImmunoBody vector and upon immunization these T cell epitopes are efficiently processed and presented to stimulate high frequency helper and CTL responses capable of anti-tumor activity.",M2
20042512,"Relationship between antibody 2F5 neutralization of HIV-1 and hydrophobicity of its heavy chain third complementarity-determining region.The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein is the target of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. Prior studies have suggested a two-component mechanism for 2F5-mediated neutralization involving both structure-specific recognition of a gp41 protein epitope and nonspecific interaction with the viral lipid membrane. Here, we mutationally alter a hydrophobic patch on the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (<e>CDR</e> H3) of the 2F5 antibody and assess the abilities of altered 2F5 variants to bind gp41 and to neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1. CDR H3 alterations had little effect on the affinity of 2F5 variants for a peptide corresponding to its gp41 epitope. In contrast, strong effects and a high degree of correlation (P &lt; 0.0001) were found between virus neutralization and CDR H3 hydrophobicity, as defined by predicted free energies of transfer from water to a lipid bilayer interface or to octanol. The effect of CDR H3 hydrophobicity on neutralization was independent of isolate sensitivity to 2F5, and CDR H3 variants with tryptophan substitutions were able to neutralize HIV-1 approximately 10-fold more potently than unmodified 2F5. A threshold was observed for increased hydrophobicity of the 2F5 CDR H3 loop beyond which effects on 2F5-mediated neutralization leveled off. Together, the results provide a more complete understanding of the 2F5 mechanism of HIV-1 neutralization and indicate ways to enhance the potency of MPER-directed antibodies.",M2
19997599,"Antibody complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>): a bridge between adaptive and innate immunity.BACKGROUND: It has been documented that, independently from the specificity of the native antibody (Ab) for a given antigen (Ag), complementarity determining regions (CDR)-related peptides may display differential antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we demonstrate that a synthetic peptide with sequence identical to V(H)CDR3 of a mouse monoclonal Ab (mAb) specific for difucosyl human blood group A is easily taken up by macrophages with subsequent stimulation of: i) proinflammatory cytokine production; ii) PI3K-Akt pathway and iii) TLR-4 expression. Significantly, V(H)CDR3 exerts therapeutic effect against systemic candidiasis without possessing direct candidacidal properties.

19939452,"A germline knowledge based computational approach for determining antibody complementarity determining regions.Determination of framework regions (FRs) and complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) in an antibody is essential for understanding the underlying biology as well as antibody engineering and optimization. However, there are no computational algorithms available to delimit an antibody sequence or a library of sequences into FRs and CDRs in a coherent and automatic fashion. Based upon the mapping relationships among mature antibody sequences and their corresponding germline gene segments, a novel computational algorithm has been developed for automatic determination of CDRs. Even though a human can make more than 10(12) different antibody molecules in its preimmune repertoire to fight off invading pathogens, these antibodies are generated from rearrangements of a very limited number of germline variable (V) gene, diversity (D) gene and joining (J) gene segments followed by somatic hypermutation. The framework regions FR1, FR2 and FR3 in mature antibodies are encoded by germline V gene segments, while FR4 is encoded by J gene segments. Since there are only a limited number of germline gene segments, these genes can be pre-delimited to generate a knowledge base of FRs and CDRs. Then for a given antibody sequence, the algorithm scans each pre-delimited gene in knowledge base, finds the best matching V and J segments, and accordingly, identifies the FRs and CDRs. The described algorithm is stringently tested using nearly 25,000 human antibody sequences from NCBI, and it is proven to be very robust. Over 99.7% of antibody sequences can be delimited computationally. Of those delimited sequences, only 0.28% of them have somatic insertions and deletions in FRs, and their corresponding delimited results need manual checking. Another feature of the algorithm is that it is CDR definition independent, and can be easily extended to other CDR definitions besides the most widely used Kabat, Chothia and IMGT definitions. In addition to delimitation of antibody sequences into FRs and CDRs, the described algorithm is good for sequence annotation and sequence quality control by detecting unusual sequence patterns and features. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the algorithm may easily be embedded into other applications, such as to create a gene family specific PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix) for antibody engineering, and to automatically number an antibody sequence.",M2
19819766,"Identification and measurement of isoaspartic acid formation in the complementarity determining region of a fully human monoclonal antibody.Isomerization plays a key role in protein degradation. This isomerization is often difficult to detect by many protein characterization methods such as SDS-PAGE, SEC, and IEF. This work shows the identification of an isomerized aspartic acid residue in the CDR2 of the heavy chain of a fully human monoclonal antibody. This isoaspartic acid increases significantly with storage at 2-8 degrees C. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was utilized to separate the isoaspartic variant in the intact state. Mass spectrometry including peptide mapping was employed to identify and confirm the exact location of the modification. Since this modification occurs in the complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) it was found that binding is reduced. Therefore, three different analytical methods for regular analysis of this isomerization are evaluated. These methods include peptide mapping by LC-MS, HIC, and a protein isoaspartate methyltransferase assay. It was determined that HIC is the best method to regularly assay the level of isomerization in this monoclonal antibody.",M2
19808684,"A combinatorial approach for the design of complementarity-determining region-derived peptidomimetics with in vitro anti-tumoral activity.The great success of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has fueled research toward mimicry of their binding sites and the development of new strategies for peptide-based mimetics production. Here, we describe a new combinatorial approach for the production of peptidomimetics using the complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) from gastrin17 (pyroEGPWLEEEEEAYGWMDF-NH(2)) antibodies as starting material for cyclic peptide synthesis in a microarray format. Gastrin17 is a trophic factor in gastrointestinal tumors, including pancreatic cancer, which makes it an interesting target for development of therapeutic antibodies. Screening of microarrays containing bicyclic peptidomimetics identified a high number of gastrin binders. A strong correlation was observed between gastrin binding and overall charge of the peptidomimetic. Most of the best gastrin binders proceeded from CDRs containing charged residues. In contrast, CDRs from high affinity antibodies containing mostly neutral residues failed to yield good binders. Our experiments revealed essential differences in the mode of antigen binding between CDR-derived peptidomimetics (K(d) values in micromolar range) and the parental monoclonal antibodies (K(d) values in nanomolar range). However, chemically derived peptidomimetics from gastrin binders were very effective in gastrin neutralization studies using cell-based assays, yielding a neutralizing activity in pancreatic tumoral cell lines comparable with that of gastrin-specific monoclonal antibodies. These data support the use of combinatorial CDR-peptide microarrays as a tool for the development of a new generation of chemically synthesized cyclic peptidomimetics with functional activity.",M2
19806678,"Isomerization in the CDR2 of a monoclonal antibody: Binding analysis and factors that influence the isomerization rate.Isomerization of a monoclonal antibody is one of the common routes of protein degradation. An isomerization in the complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) was found previously and is investigated in depth in this work. Affinity analysis proves that the antibody with one isomerized heavy chain has lower binding. Binding constants were determined, and exhibited a slower on-rate in conjunction with a faster off-rate for this isomerization. To determine the role of the buffer on the rate of isomerization, this antibody was incubated in various matrices and the amount of isomerized antibody was determined by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). The rate was found to be dependent on the pH as well as the net negative charge of the buffer components that can act as proton acceptors. An Arrhenius plot was performed to predict the levels of isomerization and a comparison of real samples proved the model was correct. This work affirms that isomerization in the CDR of a therapeutic antibody is important to monitor and the formulation buffer plays a significant role in the rate of the isomerization.",M2
19804909,"The human neonatal B cell response to respiratory syncytial virus uses a biased antibody variable gene repertoire that lacks somatic mutations.The human Ab repertoire exhibits restrictions during fetal life characterized by biases of variable gene segment usage and lack of junctional diversity. We tested the hypotheses that Ab repertoire restriction persists in the early postnatal period and contributes to the observed poor quality of specific Ab responses made by neonates to viruses and vaccines. We analyzed the molecular determinants of B cell responses in humans to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Analysis of the variable gene segment usage of adult RSV-specific B cells revealed a repertoire profile in these cells similar to that seen in randomly selected B cells, which was V(H)3-dominant. Four gene segments (V(H)3-23, V(H)3-30, V(H)3-33 and V(H)4-04) accounted for almost half of the V(H) genes used. In contrast, very young infant RSV-specific antibodies exhibited a biased repertoire characterized by comparable use of the V(H)1, V(H)3, and V(H)4 families, and less common use of the four immunodominant gene segments. Infants and children older than three months used an antibody repertoire similar to that of adults. Mutational analysis revealed that the antibody variable genes of infants under three months of age also possessed significantly fewer somatic mutations in both framework and complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) regions than those of adults, even in a child with recurrent RSV infection. These data suggest that neonates use a biased antibody gene repertoire that is less V(H)3-focused and that possesses a dramatically lower frequency of somatic mutations. These biased features of the RSV-specific repertoire likely contribute to the poor functional Ab response in very young infants.",M2
19767317,"The role of <e>CDR</e> H3 in antibody recognition of a synthetic analog of a lipopolysaccharide antigen.In order to explore the structural basis for adaptability in near germline monoclonal antibodies (mAb), we have examined the specificity of the promiscuous mAb S67-27 to both naturally derived carbohydrate antigens and a variety of synthetic nonnatural antigens based on the bacterial lipopolysaccharide component 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo). One such analog, a 7-O-methyl (7-O-Me) Kdo disaccharide, was found to bind to the antibody with at least 30-fold higher affinity than any other antigen tested. The structure of S67-27 in complex with this analog and three other naturally occurring Kdo antigens revealed that the enhanced affinity of the mAb for the synthetic analog was accomplished by the strategic positioning of CDR H3 away from a conserved Kdo binding pocket that allowed the formation of new antibody-antigen contacts. Furthermore, the comparison of this structure with the structures of related mAbs revealed how the position and structure of CDR H3 influence the specificity or promiscuity of near-germline carbohydrate-recognizing antibodies by altering the architecture of the combining site.",M2

To study the etiology of FS, hybridomas that secrete either IgM or IgG (predominantly IgG1 subclass) autoantibodies were generated from the B cells of eight FS patients and one individual 4 years before FS onset, and the H and L chain V genes of anti-DSG1 autoantibodies were analyzed. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these anti-DSG1 autoantibodies are antigen selected. First, clonally related sets of anti-DSG1 hybridomas characterize the response in individual FS patients. Second, H and L chain V gene use seems to be biased, particularly among IgG hybridomas, and third, most hybridomas are mutants and exhibit a bias in favor of <e>CDR</e> (complementary determining region) amino acid replacement (R) mutations. Strikingly, pre-FS hybridomas also exhibit evidence of antigen selection, including an overlap in V(H) gene use and shared multiple R mutations with anti-DSG1 FS hybridomas, suggesting selection by the same or a similar antigen. We conclude that the anti-DSG1 response in FS is antigen driven and that selection for mutant anti-DSG1 B cells begins well before the onset of disease.",M2

The ability to precisely define the final diversity of a library facilitates the process of isolating, characterizing, and optimizing an antibody lead. Here we describe detailed protocols for the design and construction of phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries in which diversity is generated in the complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) of the V(H) of a single humanized bivalent Fab scaffold.

19475547,"Succinimide formation at Asn 55 in the complementarity determining region of a recombinant monoclonal antibody IgG1 heavy chain.We investigated the formation and stability of succinimide, an intermediate of deamidation events, in recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). During the course of an analytical development study of an IgG1 mAbs, we observed that a specific antibody population could be separated from the main product by cation-exchange (CEX) chromatography. The cell-based bioassay measured a approximately 70% drop in potency for this fraction. Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed that the modified CEX fraction resulted from the formation of a succinimide intermediate at Asn 55 in the complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) of the heavy chain. Biacore assay revealed a approximately 50% decrease in ligand binding activity for the succinimide-containing Fab with respect to the native Fab. It was found that the succinimide form existed as a stable intermediate with a half-life of approximately 3 h at 37 degrees C and pH 7.6. Stress studies indicated that mildly acidic pH conditions (pH 5) favored succinimide accumulation, causing a gradual loss in potency. Hydrolysis of the succinimide resulted in a further drop in potency. The implications of the succinimide formation at Asn 55, a highly conserved residue among IgG1 (mAbs), are discussed.",M2
19458157,"RosettaAntibody: antibody variable region homology modeling server.The RosettaAntibody server (http://antibody.graylab.jhu.edu) predicts the structure of an antibody variable region given the amino-acid sequences of the respective light and heavy chains. In an initial stage, the server identifies and displays the most sequence homologous template structures for the light and heavy framework regions and each of the complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) loops. Subsequently, the most homologous templates are assembled into a side-chain optimized crude model, and the server returns a picture and coordinate file. For users requesting a high-resolution model, the server executes the full RosettaAntibody protocol which additionally models the hyper-variable CDR H3 loop. The high-resolution protocol also relieves steric clashes by optimizing the CDR backbone torsion angles and by simultaneously perturbing the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains. RosettaAntibody generates 2000 independent structures, and the server returns pictures, coordinate files, and detailed scoring information for the 10 top-scoring models. The 10 models enable users to use rational judgment in choosing the best model or to use the set as an ensemble for further studies such as docking.

19416894,"Many different Vbeta CDR3s can reveal the inherent MHC reactivity of germline-encoded TCR V regions.We have hypothesized that in the prenegative selection TCR repertoire, many somatically generated complementary-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 loops combine with evolutionarily selected germline Valpha/Vbeta CDR1/CDR2 loops to create highly MHC/peptide cross-reactive T cells that are subsequently deleted by negative selection. Here, we present a mutational analysis of the Vbeta CDR3 of such a cross-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR), YAe62. Most YAe62 TCRs with the mutant CDR3s became less MHC promiscuous. However, others with CDR3s unrelated in sequence to the original recognized even more MHC alleles than the original TCR. Most importantly, this recognition was still dependent on the conserved CDR1/CDR2 residues. These results bolster the idea that germline TCR V elements are inherently reactive to MHC but that this reactivity is fine-tuned by the somatically generated CDR3 loops.",M2
19412639,"Exploration of factors affecting the onset and maturation course of follicular lymphoma through simulations of the germinal center.Genetic mutations frequently observed in human follicular lymphoma (FL) B-cells result in aberrant expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 and surface immunoglobulins (Igs) which display one or more novel variable (V) region N-glycosylation motifs. In the present study, we develop a simulation model of the germinal center (GC) to explore how these mutations might influence the emergence and clonal expansion of key mutants which provoke FL development. The simulations employ a stochastic method for calculating the cellular dynamics, which incorporates actual IgV region sequences and a simplified hypermutation scheme. We first bring our simulations into agreement with experimental data for well-characterized normal and bcl-2(+) anti-hapten GC responses in mice to provide a model for understanding how bcl-2 expression leads to permissive selection and memory cell differentiation of weakly competitive B-cells. However, as bcl-2 expression in the GC alone is thought to be insufficient for FL development, we next monitor simulated IgV region mutations to determine the emergence times of key mutants displaying aberrant N-glycosylation motifs recurrently observed in human FL IgV regions. Simulations of 26 germline V(H) gene segments indicate that particular IgV regions have a dynamical selective advantage by virtue of the speed with which one or more of their key sites can generate N-glycosylation motifs upon hypermutation. Separate calculations attribute the high occurrence frequency of such IgV regions in FL to an ability to produce key mutants at a fast enough rate to overcome stochastic processes in the GC that hinder clonal expansion. Altogether, these simulations characterize three pathways for FL maturation through positively selected N-glycosylations, namely, via one of two key sites within germline V(H) region gene segments, or via a site in the third heavy chain complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>-H3) that is generated from VDJ recombination.",M2
19361524,"Epitope mapping of anti-interleukin-13 neutralizing antibody CNTO607.CNTO607 is a neutralizing anti-interleukin-13 (IL-13) human monoclonal antibody obtained from a phage display library. To determine how this antibody inhibits the biological effect of IL-13, we determined the binding epitope by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of the complex between CNTO607 Fab and IL-13 reveals the antibody epitope at the surface formed by helices A and D of IL-13. This epitope overlaps with the IL-4Ralpha/IL-13Ralpha1 receptor-binding site, which explains the neutralizing effect of CNTO607. The extensive antibody interface covers an area of 1000 A(2), which is consistent with the high binding affinity. The key features of the interface are the charge and shape complementarity of the molecules that include two hydrophobic pockets on IL-13 that accommodate Phe32 [complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) L2] and Trp100a (CDR H3) and a number of salt bridges between basic residues of IL-13 and acidic residues of the antibody. Comparison with the structure of the free Fab shows that the CDR residues do not change their conformation upon complex formation, with the exception of two residues in CDR H3, Trp100a and Asp100b, which change rotamer conformations. To evaluate the relative contribution of the epitope residues to CNTO607 binding, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the A-D region of IL-13. This study confirmed the primary role of electrostatic interactions for antigen recognition.",M2
19285987,"Affinity maturation of a humanized rat antibody for anti-RAGE therapy: comprehensive mutagenesis reveals a high level of mutational plasticity both inside and outside the complementarity-determining regions.Antibodies that neutralize RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-ligand interactions have potential therapeutic applications in both acute and chronic diseases. We generated XT-M4, a rat anti-RAGE monoclonal antibody that has in vivo efficacy in an acute sepsis model. This antibody was subsequently humanized. To improve the affinity of this antibody for the treatment of chronic indications, we used random and targeted mutagenesis strategies in combination with ribosome and phage-display technologies, respectively, to generate libraries of XT-M4 variants. We identified a panel of single-chain Fv antibody fragments (scFv's) that was improved up to 110-fold in a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence competition assay against parental XT-M4 immunoglobulin G (IgG). After reformatting to bivalent scFv-Fc fusions and IgGs, we observed similar gains in potency in the same assay. Further analysis of binding kinetics as IgG revealed multiple variants with subnanomolar apparent affinity that was dictated primarily by improvements in the off-rate. All variants also had improved binding to cell surface-expressed human RAGE, and all retained, or had improved, apparent affinity for mouse RAGE. F100bL in V(H) (variable region of the heavy chain) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) was one of a number of key mutations that correlated with affinity improvements and was independently identified by both mutagenesis strategies. Random mutagenesis coupled with ribosome display and high-throughput screening revealed an unexpectedly high level of mutational plasticity across the whole length of the humanized scFv, suggesting greater scope for structural optimization outside of the primary antigen-combining site defined by V(H) CDR3 and V(kappa) CDR3. In summary, our comprehensive mutagenesis approach not only achieved the desired affinity maturation of XT-M4 but also defined multiple mutational hotspots across the antibody sequence, provided an insight into the specificity-determining residues of the antibody paratope, and identified additional sites within the <e>CDR</e> loops where human germ-line amino acids may be introduced without affecting function.",M2
19277506,"Construction of a large synthetic human scFv library with six diversified <e>CDRs</e> and high functional diversity.Antibody phage display provides a powerful and efficient tool for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic and other applications. Antibody clones from synthetic libraries with optimized design features have several distinct advantages that include high stability, high levels of expression, and ease of downstream optimization and engineering. In this study, a fully synthetic human scFv library with six diversified CDRs was constructed by polymerase chain reaction assembly of overlapping oligonucleotides. In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a beta-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5'-end of the beta-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection. A final library with an estimated total diversity of 7.6 x 10(9), greater than 70% functional diversity, and diversification of all six CDRs was obtained after insertion of fully randomized CDR-H3 sequences into this proofread repertoire. The performance of the library was validated using a number of target antigens, against which multiple unique scFv sequences with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were isolated.",M2
19262510,"Germline-encoded amino acids in the alphabeta T-cell receptor control thymic selection.An alphabeta T-cell response depends on the recognition of antigen plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins by its antigen receptor (TCR). The ability of peripheral alphabeta T cells to recognize MHC is at least partly determined by MHC-dependent thymic selection, by which an immature T cell survives only if its TCR can recognize self MHC. This process may allow MHC-reactive TCRs to be selected from a repertoire with completely random and unbiased specificities. However, analysis of thymocytes before positive selection indicated that TCR proteins might have a predetermined ability to bind MHC. Here we show that specific germline-encoded amino acids in the TCR promote 'generic' MHC recognition and control thymic selection. In mice expressing single, rearranged TCR beta-chains, individual mutation of amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 2beta to Ala reduced development of the entire TCR repertoire. Altogether, these results show that thymic selection is controlled by germline-encoded MHC contact points in the alphabeta TCR and indicate that the diversity of the peripheral T-cell repertoire is enhanced by this 'built-in' specificity.",M2
19252851,"Improving antibody binding affinity and specificity for therapeutic development.Affinity maturation is an important part of the therapeutic antibody development process as in vivo activity often requires high binding affinity. Here, we describe a targeted approach for affinity improvement of therapeutic antibodies. Sets of <e>CDR</e> residues that are solvent accessible and relatively diverse in natural antibodies are targeted for diversification. Degenerate oligonucleotides are used to generate combinatorial phage-displayed antibody libraries with varying degree of diversity at randomized positions from which high-affinity antibodies can be selected. An advantage of using antibodies for therapy is their exquisite target specificity, which enables selective antigen binding and reduces off-target effects. However, it can be useful, and often it is necessary, to generate cross-reactive antibodies binding to not only the human antigen but also the corresponding non-human primate or rodent orthologs. Such cross-reactive antibodies can be used to validate the therapeutic targeting and examine the safety profile in preclinical animal models before committing to a costly development track. We show how affinity improvement and cross-species binding can be achieved in a one-step process.",M2
19220320,"Composition of the immunoglobulin classic antigen-binding site regulates allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of experimental asthma.BACKGROUND: When bound to mast cell FcepsilonRI, IgE serves as antigen receptor for allergic reactions, permitting specific identification of the allergen. Although the core of the classic antigen-binding site is heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (<e>CDR</e>-H3), recent studies suggest that allergens might also bind IgE in a superantigen-like fashion outside the classic antigen-binding site. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the contribution of the classic CDR-H3-centric antigen-binding site to the development of an allergic phenotype. METHODS: Using a murine model of experimental asthma, we characterized a gene-targeted mouse strain expressing an altered range of CDR-H3s (DeltaD-iD mice) in response to the hydrophobic allergen ovalbumin (OVA). Mutant and wild-type (wt) mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with OVA; non-sensitized mice served as controls. RESULTS: We found the composition of the classic CDR-H3-centric antigen-binding site to be critical for the development of characteristic aspects of allergic asthma. (i) Compared with wt animals, DeltaD-iD mice showed a significantly less pronounced OVA-induced rise in allergen-specific IgE levels and hence in total serum IgE levels. (ii) In addition, DeltaD-iD mice demonstrated a significant reduction in eosinophilic airway inflammation, as well as in interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13 levels in BAL fluids. CONCLUSION: Allergic sensitization and airway inflammation depend on the composition of the predominant CDR-H3 repertoire, suggesting that the classic CDR-H3-centric antigen-binding site plays a crucial role in creating the immunological interface between allergen and IgE. Our results further emphasize a central role of IgE, not only in mediating but also in regulating the allergic immune response.",M2
19194863,"Multi-constraint computational design suggests that native sequences of germline antibody H3 loops are nearly optimal for conformational flexibility.The limited size of the germline antibody repertoire has to recognize a far larger number of potential antigens. The ability of a single antibody to bind multiple ligands due to conformational flexibility in the antigen-binding site can significantly enlarge the repertoire. Among the six complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) that generally comprise the binding site, the CDR H3 loop is particularly variable. Computational protein design studies showed that predicted low energy sequences compatible with a given backbone structure often have considerable similarity to the corresponding native sequences of naturally occurring proteins, indicating that native protein sequences are close to optimal for their structures. Here, we take a step forward to determine whether conformational flexibility, believed to play a key functional role in germline antibodies, is also central in shaping their native sequence. In particular, we use a multi-constraint computational design strategy, along with the Rosetta scoring function, to propose that the native sequences of CDR H3 loops from germline antibodies are nearly optimal for conformational flexibility. Moreover, we find that antibody maturation may lead to sequences with a higher degree of optimization for a single conformation, while disfavoring sequences that are intrinsically flexible. In addition, this computational strategy allows us to predict mutations in the CDR H3 loop to stabilize the antigen-bound conformation, a computational mimic of affinity maturation, that may increase antigen binding affinity by preorganizing the antigen binding loop. In vivo affinity maturation data are consistent with our predictions. The method described here can be useful to design antibodies with higher selectivity and affinity by reducing conformational diversity.",M2
19108623,"Sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of a WSSV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody.Antibodies raised against individual viral envelope proteins have been used in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) neutralization assays. We report here the sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding the variable regions of a novel monoclonal antibody that binds to the viral envelope protein and neutralizes WSSV infection. The heavy and light variable chains are most homologous to VH7183 germline gene (AF120472) and IgVk RF germline gene (AJ235936), respectively. Database searches using the derived sequences predicted residues comprising <e>CDR</e> loops. The 12 amino acid residue of the heavy chain CDR3 is rich in negatively charged aspartic acid (25%) and did not show significant homology to any murine V gene available on the database. This study provides insights on the paratope-epitope interaction and can be used to identify compounds with comparable properties as the paratope leading to future development of drugs and vaccines for WSSV infection.",M2
19074157,"An antibody loop replacement design feasibility study and a loop-swapped dimer structure.A design approach was taken to investigate the feasibility of replacing single complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) antibody loops. This approach may complement simpler mutation-based strategies for rational antibody design by expanding conformation space. Enormous crystal structure diversity is available, making CDR loops logical targets for structure-based design. A detailed analysis for the L1 loop shows that each loop length takes a distinct conformation, thereby allowing control on a length scale beyond that accessible to simple mutations. The L1 loop in the anti-VLA1 antibody was replaced with the L2 loop residues longer in an attempt to add an additional hydrogen bond and fill space on the antibody-antigen interface. The designs expressed well, but failed to improve affinity. In an effort to learn more, one design was crystallized and data were collected at 1.9 A resolution. The designed L1 loop takes the qualitatively desired conformation; confirming that loop replacement by design is feasible. The crystal structure also shows that the outermost loop (residues Leu51-Ser68) is domain swapped with another monomer. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were used to monitor unfolding as a function of temperature and indicate that the loop involved in domain swapping does not unfold below 60 degrees C. The domain-swapping is not directly responsible for the affinity loss, but is likely a side-effect of the structural instability which may contribute to affinity loss. A second round of design was successful in eliminating the dimerization through mutation of a residue (Leu51Ser) at the joint of the domain-swapped loop.",M2
19050258,"Preferential use of DH reading frame 2 alters B cell development and antigen-specific antibody production.All jawed vertebrates limit use of D(H) reading frames (RFs) that are enriched for hydrophobic amino acids. In BALB/c mice, DFL16.1 RF2 encodes valine and isoleucine. To test whether increased use of RF2 affects B cell function, we examined B cell development and Ab production in mice with an IgH allele (DeltaD-DmicroFS) limited to use of a single, frameshifted DFL61.1 gene segment. We compared the results of these studies to wild-type mice, as well as those previously obtained in mice limited to use of either a single normal D(H) or a single inverted D(H) that forces use of arginine in <e>CDR</e>-H3. All three of the mouse strains limited to a single D(H) produced fewer immature B cells than wild type. However, whereas mice limited to a single normal D(H) achieved normal B cell numbers in the periphery, mice forced to preferentially use RF2 had reduced numbers of mature B cells in the spleen and bone marrow, mirroring the pattern previously observed in mice enriched for charged CDR-H3s. There were two exceptions. B cells in the mice using RF2 normally populated the marginal zone and peritoneal cavity, whereas mice using inverted RF1 had increased numbers of marginal zone B cells and decreased numbers of B1a cells. When challenged with several T-dependent or T-independent Ags, Ag-specific Ab titers in the mice forced to use RF2 were altered. These findings indicate that B cell development and Ag-specific Ab production can be heavily influenced by the global amino acid content of the CDR-H3 repertoire.",M2
19033278,"Aggregation-resistant VHs selected by in vitro evolution tend to have disulfide-bonded loops and acidic isoelectric points.When panned with a transient heat denaturation approach against target enzymes, a human V(H) (antibody heavy chain variable domain) phage display library yielded V(H)s with composite characteristics of binding, non-aggregation and reversible thermal unfolding. Moreover, selection was characterized by enrichment for V(H)s with (i) an even number of disulfide forming Cys residues in complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 1 and CDR3 and (ii) acidic isoelectric points. This parallels naturally occurring camelid and shark single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) which are also characterized by (i) solubility and reversible unfolding, (ii) a high occurrence of disulfide forming Cys in their CDRs, particularly, in CDR1 and CDR3 and (iii) acidic V(H)s as inferred here by a pI distribution analysis, reported here, of pools of human and camelid V(H) and V(H)H (camelid heavy chain antibody V(H)) sequences. Our results, reinforced by previous observations by others, suggest that protein acidification may yet be another mechanism nature has devised to create functional sdAbs and that this concept along with the inclusion of inter-CDR disulfide linkages may be applied to human V(H) domains/libraries for non-aggregation optimization. In addition, calculation of theoretical pIs of V(H)s selected by panning may be used for rapid and precise identification of non-aggregating V(H)s.",M2
18991292,"Arginines in the <e>CDR</e> of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies facilitate cell internalization via electrostatic interactions.Internalization of autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) is crucial to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-dsDNA may bind to cell-surface targets in order to facilitate the subsequent cell penetration of the anti-dsDNA. In this study, we observed that the 9D7 monoclonal anti-dsDNA autoantibody (9D7 mAb) penetrates into Jurkat cells via a novel alternative pathway. Endocytosis inhibitors or a lipid-raft inhibitor did not significantly change the penetration of 9D7 mAb into the Jurkat cells. However, heparin sulfate, chondroitin sulfate B, decaarginine and chondroitinase ABC significantly suppressed the internalization and the 9D7 mAb inhibited the internalization of Tat-GFP. Moreover, the penetration of the 9D7 mAb was significantly reduced in proteoglycan-deficient cells (pgs A-745). Positively charged amino acids including arginine are commonly found in the CDR of the 9D7 mAb. Point mutations to the arginine residues in the CDR of the H chain of the recombinant 9D7 mAb significantly attenuated its DNA-binding and cell-penetration abilities. These findings indicate that cell penetration of anti-dsDNA is due to the electrostatic interactions of arginine residues in the CDR with the negatively charged sulfated polysaccharides on the cell surface.",M2
18989460,"Broadening of neutralization activity to directly block a dominant antibody-driven SARS-coronavirus evolution pathway.Phylogenetic analyses have provided strong evidence that amino acid changes in spike (S) protein of animal and human SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) during and between two zoonotic transfers (2002/03 and 2003/04) are the result of positive selection. While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)  hot spot  in a light chain <e>CDR</e> (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.",M2
18986373,"B-cell diversity decreases in old age and is correlated with poor health status.Older people suffer from a decline in immune system, which affects their ability to respond to infections and to raise efficient responses to vaccines. Effective and specific antibodies in responses from older individuals are decreased in favour of non-specific antibody production. We investigated the B-cell repertoire in DNA samples from peripheral blood of individuals aged 86-94 years, and a control group aged 19-54 years, using spectratype analysis of the IGHV complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>)3. We found that a proportion of older individuals had a dramatic collapse in their B-cell repertoire diversity. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products from a selection of samples indicated that this loss of diversity was characterized by clonal expansions of B cells in vivo. Statistical analysis of the spectratypes enabled objective comparisons and showed that loss of diversity correlated very strongly with the general health status of the individuals; a distorted spectratype can be used to predict frailty. Correlations with survival and vitamin B12 status were also seen. We conclude that B-cell diversity can decrease dramatically with age and may have important implications for the immune health of older people. B-cell immune frailty is also a marker of general frailty.",M2
18941213,"Automated identification of complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) reveals peculiar characteristics of CDRs and B cell epitopes.Exact identification of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) is crucial for understanding and manipulating antigenic interactions. One way to do this is by marking residues on the antibody that interact with B cell epitopes on the antigen. This, of course, requires identification of B cell epitopes, which could be done by marking residues on the antigen that bind to CDRs, thus requiring identification of CDRs. To circumvent this vicious circle, existing tools for identifying CDRs are based on sequence analysis or general biophysical principles. Often, these tools, which are based on partial data, fail to agree on the boundaries of the CDRs. Herein we present an automated procedure for identifying CDRs and B cell epitopes using consensus structural regions that interact with the antigens in all known antibody-protein complexes. Consequently, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of all CDR-epitope complexes of known three-dimensional structure. The CDRs we identify only partially overlap with the regions suggested by existing methods. We found that the general physicochemical properties of both CDRs and B cell epitopes are rather peculiar. In particular, only four amino acids account for most of the sequence of CDRs, and several types of amino acids almost never appear in them. The secondary structure content and the conservation of B cell epitopes are found to be different than previously thought. These characteristics of CDRs and epitopes may be instrumental in choosing which residues to mutate in experimental search for epitopes. They may also assist in computational design of antibodies and in predicting B cell epitopes.",M2
18825755,"Collagen type II is recognized by a pathogenic antibody through germline encoded structures.Collagen type II (CII) is a cartilage-specific target of pathologic humoral autoimmune responses in rheumatoid arthritis as well as in the collagen-induced arthritis model. The aim of the present study is to investigate the critical amino acid residues conferring CII epitope specificity of the prototypic arthritogenic murine mAb CIIC1. A homology model of the CIIC1 single-chain antibody fragment (CIIC1scFv) in complex with its triple helical epitope was established. In silico predictions based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations were experimentally tested by the recombinant expression and functional analysis of CIIC1scFv containing alanine replacements allowing the identification of crucial CII-binding sites in the CDR2 and CDR3 regions of both heavy and light chains. Since the conversion of the CIIC1scFv sequence into the respective germline at all 13 somatically mutated positions did not affect its CII binding, our data indicate that potentially harmful cartilage-specific humoral autoimmunity could be germline encoded. The molecular modeling further demonstrates that the rigid collagen triple helix restricts the likelihood of molecular interactions with the <e>CDR</e> regions of the antibody considerably compared with globular antigens. These sterical constraints provide an explanation as to why somatic mutations in the arthritogenic autoantibody have no obvious impact on CII recognition.",M2
18800968,"Conformational changes and flexibility in T-cell receptor recognition of peptide-MHC complexes.A necessary feature of the immune system, TCR (T-cell receptor) cross-reactivity has been implicated in numerous autoimmune pathologies and is an underlying cause of transplant rejection. Early studies of the interactions of alphabeta TCRs (T-cell receptors) with their peptide-MHC ligands suggested that conformational plasticity in the TCR <e>CDR</e> (complementarity determining region) loops is a dominant contributor to T-cell cross-reactivity. Since these initial studies, the database of TCRs whose structures have been solved both bound and free is now large enough to permit general conclusions to be drawn about the extent of TCR plasticity and the types and locations of motion that occur. In the present paper, we review the conformational differences between free and bound TCRs, quantifying the structural changes that occur and discussing their possible roles in specificity and cross-reactivity. We show that, rather than undergoing major structural alterations or 'folding' upon binding, the majority of TCR CDR loops shift by relatively small amounts. The structural changes that do occur are dominated by hinge-bending motions, with loop remodelling usually occurring near loop apexes. As predicted from previous studies, the largest changes are in the hypervariable CDR3alpha and CDR3beta loops, although in some cases the germline-encoded CDR1alpha and CDR2alpha loops shift in magnitudes that approximate those of the CDR3 loops. Intriguingly, the smallest shifts are in the germline-encoded loops of the beta-chain, consistent with recent suggestions that the TCR beta domain may drive ligand recognition.",M2
18798566,"Systematic classification of <e>CDR</e>-L3 in antibodies: implications of the light chain subtypes and the VL-VH interface.Antibody modeling is widely used for the analysis of antibody-antigen interactions and for the design of potent antibody drugs. The antibody combining site is composed of six complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The CDRs, except for CDR-H3, which is the most diverse CDR, form limited numbers of canonical structures, which can be identified from the amino acid sequences. A method to classify the CDR-H3 structure from its amino acid sequence was previously proposed. However, since those CDR structures were classified, many more antibody crystal structures have been determined. We performed systematic analyses of the CDR-L3 structures and found novel canonical structures, and we also classified a previously identified canonical structure into two subtypes. In addition, two differently defined canonical structures in the kappa and lambda subtypes were classified into the same canonical structure. We also identified a key residue in CDR-L3, which determines the conformation of CDR-H3. Several analyses of CDR-L3 loops longer than nine residues were performed. These new findings should be useful for structural modeling and are eventually expected to accelerate the design of antibody drugs.",M2
18722015,"In vitro affinity maturation of human GM-CSF antibodies by targeted <e>CDR</e>-diversification.The mammalian immune system applies somatic hypermutation to select for antibodies with improved dissociation rates in vivo up to an intrinsic limit, previously termed as affinity ceiling. However, for certain therapeutic applications it may be desirable to further improve antibody affinities beyond that limit. In this study the selection of antibodies specific for the pro-inflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from the HuCAL GOLD human antibody library is described. In order to increase affinity and also functional activity, in vitro affinity maturation of a pool of lead Fab candidates was carried out. CDR-L3 and parallel CDR-H2 diversification using trinucleotide consensus cassettes were followed by the combination of optimized CDR-L3 and CDR-H2 leading to a 5000-fold improved affinity finally reaching a K(D) of 400 fM. Cytokine neutralizing potential of MOR04357 was evaluated in a TF-1 proliferation assay. Along with affinity optimization a 2000-fold increase in potency was observed compared to the parental antibody. Due to species cross-reactivity MOR04357 also blocks rat GM-CSF induced proliferation of FDCP-1 cells. Receptor inhibition studies showed that MOR04357 prevents the interaction of GM-CSF with the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain. As a consequence this leads to a blockade in signal transduction as measured by abolished STAT5 phosphorylation in the presence of GM-CSF and antibody. Due to its pro-inflammatory role GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or asthma. Based on the mode of action described herein MOR04357 shows favourable antibody features as a potential drug candidate.",M2
18574150,"Affinity maturation of antibodies assisted by in silico modeling.Rational engineering methods can be applied with reasonable success to optimize physicochemical characteristics of proteins, in particular, antibodies. Here, we describe a combined CDR3 walking randomization and rational design-based approach to enhance the affinity of the human anti-gastrin TA4 scFv. The application of this methodology to TA4 scFv, displaying only a weak overall affinity for gastrin17 (K(D) = 6 microM), resulted in a set of nine affinity-matured scFv variants with near-nanomolar affinity (K(D) = 13.2 nM for scFv TA4.112). First, <e>CDR</e>-H3 and CDR-L3 randomization resulted in three scFvs with an overall affinity improvement of 15- to 35-fold over the parental. Then, the modeling of two scFv constructs selected from the previous step (TA4.11 and TA4.13) was followed by a combination of manual and molecular dynamics-based docking of gastrin17 into the respective binding sites, analysis of apparent packing defects, and selection of residues for mutagenesis through phage display. Nine scFv mutants were obtained from the second maturation step. A final 454-fold improvement in affinity compared with TA4 was obtained. These scFvs showed an enhanced potency to inhibit gastrin-induced proliferation in Colo 320 WT and BxPc3 tumoral cells. In conclusion, we propose a structure-based rational method to accelerate the development of affinity-matured antibody constructs with enhanced potential for therapeutic use.",M2
18545659,"Antibody complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) can display differential antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities.BACKGROUND: Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are immunoglobulin (Ig) hypervariable domains that determine specific antibody (Ab) binding. We have shown that synthetic CDR-related peptides and many decapeptides spanning the variable region of a recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antiidiotypic Ab are candidacidal in vitro. An alanine-substituted decapeptide from the variable region of this Ab displayed increased cytotoxicity in vitro and/or therapeutic effects in vivo against various bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The possibility that isolated CDRs, represented by short synthetic peptides, may display antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities irrespective of Ab specificity for a given antigen is addressed here. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CDR-based synthetic peptides of murine and human monoclonal Abs directed to: a) a protein epitope of Candida albicans cell wall stress mannoprotein; b) a synthetic peptide containing well-characterized B-cell and T-cell epitopes; c) a carbohydrate blood group A substance, showed differential inhibitory activities in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo against C. albicans, HIV-1 and B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells, conceivably involving different mechanisms of action. Antitumor activities involved peptide-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Engineered peptides, obtained by alanine substitution of Ig CDR sequences, and used as surrogates of natural point mutations, showed further differential increased/unaltered/decreased antimicrobial, antiviral and/or antitumor activities. The inhibitory effects observed were largely independent of the specificity of the native Ab and involved chiefly germline encoded CDR1 and CDR2 of light and heavy chains. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The high frequency of bioactive peptides based on CDRs suggests that Ig molecules are sources of an unlimited number of sequences potentially active against infectious agents and tumor cells. The easy production and low cost of small sized synthetic peptides representing Ig CDRs and the possibility of peptide engineering and chemical optimization associated to new delivery mechanisms are expected to give rise to a new generation of therapeutic agents.",M2
18473392,"The structure of the anti-c-myc antibody 9E10 Fab fragment/epitope peptide complex reveals a novel binding mode dominated by the heavy chain hypervariable loops.The X-ray structure of the Fab fragment from the anti-c-myc antibody 9E10 was determined both as complex with its epitope peptide and for the free Fab. In the complex, two Fab molecules adopt an unusual head to head orientation with the epitope peptide arranged between them. In contrast, the free Fab forms a dimer with different orientation. In the Fab/peptide complex the peptide is bound to one of the two Fabs at the  back  of its extended <e>CDR</e> H3, in a cleft with CDR H1, thus forming a short, three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The N- and C-terminal parts of the peptide are also in contact with the neighboring Fab fragment. Comparison between the CDR H3s of the two Fab molecules in complex with the peptide and those from the free Fab reveals high flexibility of this loop. This structural feature is in line with thermodynamic data from isothermic titration calorimetry.",M2
18473362,"Structural classification of <e>CDR</e>-H3 revisited: a lesson in antibody modeling.Among the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in the variable domains of an antibody, the third CDR of the heavy chain (CDR-H3), which lies in the center of the antigen-binding site, plays a particularly important role in antigen recognition. CDR-H3 shows significant variability in its length, sequence, and structure. Although difficult, model building of this segment is the most critical step in antibody modeling. Since our first proposal of the  H3-rules,  which classify CDR-H3 structure based on amino acid sequence, the number of experimentally determined antibody structures has increased. Here, we revise these H3-rules and propose an improved classification scheme for CDR-H3 structure modeling. In addition, we determine the common features of CDR-H3 in antibody drugs as well as discuss the concept of  antibody druggability,  which can be applied as an indicator of antibody evaluation during drug discovery.",M2
18456562,"Synovial VLA-1+ T cells display an oligoclonal and partly distinct repertoire in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.VLA-1 integrin expressing T cells are more frequent in inflammatory synovial fluids (SF) compared to peripheral blood. Recent studies suggest that VLA-1 expression mainly marks IFNgamma+ T cells while excluding both IL-4+ and regulatory FoxP3+ T cells. To further characterize the TCR repertoire of the potentially pathogenic VLA-1+ IFNgamma+ T cells, isolated from SF of adult patients with rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, we determined the complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>)3 spectratypes. Here we show in a cohort of 9 patients that VLA-1+ T cells display a perturbed repertoire that, moreover, differs from that of VLA-1- synovial T cells and even VLA-1+ PB T cells. Importantly, random sequencing of the CDR3 region of the TCR variable beta (BV) 6.1 gene of both VLA-1+ and VLA-1- synovial T cells, in one patient, revealed that their sequences were by and large different (29 out of 33 clones). Thus, our results imply that VLA-1+ T cells that infiltrate into inflamed joints represent a partly distinct and highly oligoclonal population of Th1 cells, probably selected by unique antigens.",M2

In an attempt to improve its safety profiles, we have developed a humanized antibody of 4C8 by complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) grafting method in this study. Using a molecular model of 4C8 built by computer-assisted homology modelling, framework region (FR) residues of potential importance to the antigen binding were identified. A humanized version of 4C8, denoted as h4C8, was generated by transferring these key murine FR residues onto a human antibody framework that was selected based on homology to the mouse antibody framework, together with the mouse CDR residues. The resultant humanized antibody was shown to possess antigen-binding affinity and specificity similar to that of the original murine antibody, suggesting that it might be an alternative to mouse anti-CD34 antibodies routinely used clinically.",M2
18403566,"Affinity maturation of tacrolimus antibody for improved immunoassay performance.BACKGROUND: Organic solvents used for extraction of tacrolimus from whole blood samples lower the apparent affinity of the antibody used in a diagnostic immunoassay, thereby affecting the detection limit. METHODS: We used in vitro recombinant antibody engineering to screen and isolate clones from diverse libraries with mutagenic complementarity regions (<e>CDRs</e>) from tacrolimus 1-60-46 hybridoma cell line, with improved binding to tacrolimus in the presence of 10% methanol organic solvent solution. RESULTS: We isolated a number of clones with mutations in variable heavy (VH) CDR 2, variable light (VL) CDR 1, and VL CDR 3 with improved binding. Various combinatorial pairings constructed from these individual mutations contained &gt;10-fold improvements in both the dissociation rate and overall equilibrium affinity constants. Selected clones produced as IgG have increased functional sensitivity, with a 3- to 6-fold reduction in the limit of detection relative to the parental tacrolimus 1-60-46 monoclonal antibody in the Architect Tacrolimus immunodiagnostic assay. CONCLUSIONS: The recent advent of recombinant in vitro antibody display technologies in general, and yeast surface display in particular, allows the flexibility to engineer new or augment specific analytical characteristics, such as affinity, specificity, or stability, into previously isolated and otherwise desirable antibodies to enhance assay performance. These in vitro selections can also be performed under conditions meant to mimic the assay in which the reagent will ultimately be used, to increase the likelihood of successful assay development.",M2
18304006,"Evolutionarily conserved amino acids that control TCR-MHC interaction.The rules for the conserved reaction of alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins plus peptides are poorly understood, probably because thymocytes bearing TCRs with the strongest MHC reactivity are lost by negative selection. Thus, only TCRs with an attenuated ability to react with MHC appear on mature T cells. Also, the interaction sites between TCRs and MHC may be inherently flexible and hence difficult to spot. We reevaluated contacts between TCRs and MHC in the solved structures of their complexes with these points in mind. Relatively conserved amino acids in the TCR complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDR</e>) 1 and CDR2 are often used to bind exposed areas of the MHC alpha-helices. These areas are exposed because of small amino acids that allow somewhat flexible binding of the TCRs. The TCR amino acids involved are specific to families of variable (V) regions and to some extent different rules may govern the recognition of MHCI versus MHCII.",M2

18191144,"The human combinatorial antibody library HuCAL GOLD combines diversification of all six <e>CDRs</e> according to the natural immune system with a novel display method for efficient selection of high-affinity antibodies.This article describes the generation of the Human Combinatorial Antibody Library HuCAL GOLD. HuCAL GOLD is a synthetic human Fab library based on the HuCAL concept with all six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) diversified according to the sequence and length variability of naturally rearranged human antibodies. The human antibody repertoire was analyzed in-depth, and individual CDR libraries were designed and generated for each CDR and each antibody family. Trinucleotide mixtures were used to synthesize the CDR libraries in order to ensure a high quality within HuCAL GOLD, and a beta-lactamase selection system was employed to eliminate frame-shifted clones after successive cloning of the CDR libraries. With these methods, a large, high-quality library with more than 10 billion functional Fab fragments was achieved. By using CysDisplay, the antibody fragments are displayed on the tip of the phage via a disulfide bridge between the phage coat protein pIII and the heavy chain of the antibody fragment. Efficient elution of specific phages is possible by adding reducing agents. HuCAL GOLD was challenged with a variety of different antigens and proved to be a reliable source of high-affinity human antibodies with best affinities in the picomolar range, thus functioning as an excellent source of antibodies for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the data presented in this article demonstrate that CysDisplay is a robust and broadly applicable display technology even for high-throughput applications.",M2
18155234,"A new twist in TCR diversity revealed by a forbidden alphabeta TCR.We report crystal structures of a negatively selected T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes two I-A(u)-restricted myelin basic protein peptides and one of its peptide/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligands. Unusual complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) structural features revealed by our analyses identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the highly variable CDR3 regions define ligand specificity. In addition to the pMHC contact residues contributed by CDR3, the CDR3 residues buried deep within the V alpha/V beta interface exert indirect effects on recognition by influencing the V alpha/V beta interdomain angle. This phenomenon represents an additional mechanism for increasing the potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. Both the direct and indirect effects exerted by CDR residues can impact global TCR/MHC docking. Analysis of the available TCR structures in light of these results highlights the significance of the V alpha/V beta interdomain angle in determining specificity and indicates that TCR/pMHC interface features do not distinguish autoimmune from non-autoimmune class II-restricted TCRs.",M2
17944900,"Therapeutic vaccination with a trivalent T-cell receptor (TCR) peptide vaccine restores deficient FoxP3 expression and TCR recognition in subjects with multiple sclerosis.Therapeutic vaccination using T-cell receptor (TCR) peptides from V genes commonly expressed by potentially pathogenic T cells remains an approach of interest for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases. We developed a trivalent TCR vaccine containing complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 2 peptides from BV5S2, BV6S5 and BV13S1 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant that reliably induced high frequencies of TCR-specific T cells. To evaluate induction of regulatory T-cell subtypes, immunological and clinical parameters were followed in 23 treatment-naïve subjects with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS who received 12 monthly injections of the trivalent peptide vaccine over 1 year in an open-label study design. Prior to vaccination, subjects had reduced expression of forkhead box (Fox) P3 message and protein, and reduced recognition of the expressed TCR repertoire by TCR-reactive cells compared with healthy control donors. After three or four injections, most vaccinated MS subjects developed high frequencies of circulating interleukin (IL)-10-secreting T cells specific for the injected TCR peptides and significantly enhanced expression of FoxP3 by regulatory T cells present in both 'native' CD4+ CD25+ and 'inducible' CD4+ CD25- peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). At the end of the trial, PBMC from vaccinated MS subjects retained or further increased FoxP3 expression levels, exhibited significantly enhanced recognition of the TCR V gene repertoire apparently generated by perturbation of the TCR network, and significantly suppressed neuroantigen but not recall antigen responses. These findings demonstrate that therapeutic vaccination using only three commonly expressed BV gene determinants can induce an expanded immunoregulatory network in vivo that may optimally control complex autoreactive responses that characterize the inflammatory phase of MS.",M2
17932913,"Shark IgNAR antibody mimotopes target a murine immunoglobulin through extended CDR3 loop structures.Mimotopes mimic the three-dimensional topology of an antigen epitope, and are frequently recognized by antibodies with affinities comparable to those obtained for the original antibody-antigen interaction. Peptides and anti-idiotypic antibodies are two classes of protein mimotopes that mimic the topology (but not necessarily the sequence) of the parental antigen. In this study, we combine these two classes by selecting mimotopes based on single domain IgNAR antibodies, which display exceptionally long CDR3 loop regions (analogous to a constrained peptide library) presented in the context of an immunoglobulin framework with adjacent and supporting CDR1 loops. By screening an in vitro phage-display library of IgNAR variable domains (V(NAR)s) against the target antigen monoclonal antibody MAb5G8, we obtained four potential mimotopes. MAb5G8 targets a linear tripeptide epitope (AYP) in the flexible signal sequence of the Plasmodium falciparum Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1), and this or similar motifs were detected in the <e>CDR</e> loops of all four V(NAR)s. The V(NAR)s, 1-A-2, -7, -11, and -14, were demonstrated to bind specifically to this paratope by competition studies with an artificial peptide and all showed enhanced affinities (3-46 nM) compared to the parental antigen (175 nM). Crystallographic studies of recombinant proteins 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 showed that the SYP motifs on these V(NAR)s presented at the tip of the exposed CDR3 loops, ideally positioned within bulge-like structures to make contact with the MAb5G8 antibody. These loops, in particular in 1-A-11, were further stabilized by inter- and intra- loop disulphide bridges, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and aromatic residue packing. We rationalize the higher affinity of the V(NAR)s compared to the parental antigen by suggesting that adjacent CDR1 and framework residues contribute to binding affinity, through interactions with other CDR regions on the antibody, though of course definitive support of this hypothesis will rely on co-crystallographic studies. Alternatively, the selection of mimotopes from a large (&lt;4 x 10(8)) constrained library may have allowed selection of variants with even more favorable epitope topologies than present in the original antigenic structure, illustrating the power of in vivo selection of mimotopes from phage-displayed molecular libraries.",M2
17850583,"T cells from multiple sclerosis patients recognize multiple epitopes on Self-IgG.The highly diversified variable regions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules contain immunogenic determinants denoted idiotopes. We have previously reported that T cells from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients recognize IgG from autologous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and mapped a T-cell epitope to an IgG idiotope. To test the ability of CSF IgG molecules to elicit a broad polyclonal T-cell response in MS, we have analysed T-cell responses in the blood and CSF against idiotope peptides spanning complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 and somatic mutations within the variable regions of monoclonal CSF IgG. Consistent with a diversified idiotope-specific T-cell repertoire, CD4(+) T cells from both patients recognized several idiotope peptides presented by HLA-DR molecules. Mutations were critical for T-cell recognition, as T cells specific for a mutated CDR1 peptide did not recognize corresponding germline-encoded peptides. One T-cell clone recognized both an idiotope peptide and the B-cell clone expressing this idiotope, compatible with endogenous processing and presentation of this idiotope by B cells. These results suggest that mutated CSF IgG from MS patients carry several T-cell epitopes, which could mediate intrathecal IgG production and inflammation in MS through idiotope-driven T-B-cell collaboration.",M2
17825836,"High-throughput generation of synthetic antibodies from highly functional minimalist phage-displayed libraries.We have previously established a minimalist approach to antibody engineering by using a phage-displayed framework to support complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) diversity restricted to a binary code of tyrosine and serine. Here, we systematically augmented the original binary library with additional levels of diversity and examined the effects. The diversity of the simplest library, in which only heavy chain CDR positions were randomized by the binary code, was expanded in a stepwise manner by adding diversity to the light chain, by diversifying non-paratope residues that may influence CDR conformations, and by adding additional chemical diversity to CDR-H3. The additional diversity incrementally improved the affinities of antibodies raised against human vascular endoethelial growth factor and the structure of an antibody-antigen complex showed that tyrosine side-chains are sufficient to mediate most of the interactions with antigen, but a glycine residue in CDR-H3 was critical for providing a conformation suitable for high-affinity binding. Using new high-throughput procedures and the most complex library, we produced multiple high-affinity antibodies with dissociation constants in the single-digit nanomolar range against a wide variety of protein antigens. Thus, this fully synthetic, minimalist library has essentially recapitulated the capacity of the natural immune system to generate high-affinity antibodies. Libraries of this type should be highly useful for proteomic applications, as they minimize inherent complexities of natural antibodies that have hindered the establishment of high-throughput procedures. Furthermore, analysis of a large number of antibodies derived from these well-defined and simplistic libraries allowed us to uncover statistically significant trends in CDR sequences, which provide valuable insights into antibody library design and into factors governing protein-protein interactions.",M2

Here we show that the frequency of aggregation-resistant domains in the combinatorial repertoire remained high.

Linear analogues of the 3D structure of the epitopes are computed using this model. Extension for prediction of peptide epitopes from the protein sequence alone is also presented.

17618437,"New T cell epitopes identified from an anti-idiotypic antibody mimicking ovarian cancer associated antigen.Anti-idiotype (Id) antibodies can be used to induce specific cellular immune responses against tumor antigens, but the mechanism of antigenicity is not always clear. We previously reported an anti-Id antibody, 6B11, which mimics human ovarian cancer associated antigen OC166-9. To explore the molecular basis of cellular immune response induced by 6B11, a panel of peptides derived from complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) of 6B11 were synthesized. After a series of immunologic experiments, we found that the light chain CDR3 peptide and heavy chain CDR3 peptide were the MHC class I and class II epitopes of 6B11, respectively. The combination of MHC class I and class II epitopes is more effective than 6B11 in inducing specific cellular immune response against ovarian cancer. Our study provided the structural basis of antigenicity of 6B11. The identification of antigen-specific T cell eptitopes in 6B11 should facilitate the design of epitope-based vaccine against human ovarian cancer.",M2
17345580,"Categorical selection of the antibody repertoire in splenic B cells.In the bone marrow, the passage of developing B cells through critical checkpoints of differentiation is associated with a reduction of specific categories of CDR3 of the Ig heavy chain (<e>CDR</e>-H3), particularly those with excessive hydrophobic or charged amino acids and those with a length of eight or fewer residues. To gain insight into the role of CDR-H3 content in the development of B cells in the spleen, we compared the sequences of V(H)7183DJCmu transcripts from sorted transitional T1, marginal zone, and follicular B cell subsets to those expressed by immature IgM(+)IgD(-) and mature IgM(lo)IgD(hi) B cells in the bone marrow. Although differences in V(H) utilization were noted, the T1 CDR-H3 repertoire showed extensive similarity to that of immature bone marrow B cells, and the follicular CDR-H3 repertoire most resembled that of mature bone marrow B cells. Unlike the splenic follicular and bone marrow mature B cell CDR-H3 repertoires, the marginal zone B cell CDR-H3 repertoire retained both short and highly charged amino acid motifs, including those with two arginines. Our findings suggest that antigen binding sites containing specific categories of CDR-H3 sequence content may inhibit, permit, or even facilitate passage of the host B cell through critical checkpoints in peripheral as well as central development.",M2
17307011,"Heterogeneous antibody repertoire of marginal zone B cells specific for virus-like particles.Marginal zone (MZ) B cells differ from follicular (FO) B cells in their functional, phenotypic and localization properties. It is still unclear whether B cells from the MZ compartment also have distinct or biased BCR specificities, recognizing only a limited number of conserved antigenic structures. To address the complexity of the immune response mounted by marginal zone B cells, we compared the antibody repertoire of murine MZ and FO B cells induced by immunization with two different virus-like particles (VLPs). Antibody sequences isolated from sorted VLP-specific MZ and FO B cells were similar in heavy chain V, D and J gene segment usage. Sequence analysis of CDR3 regions of antibodies from MZ and FO B cells also revealed no consistent difference in N nucleotide additions or CDR3 length. In contrast, somatic hypermutations were reduced in <e>CDR</e> regions of antibodies from MZ B cells compared to those from FO B cells. These results indicate that the response of MZ B cells to VLPs is clonotypically heterogeneous and suggest that the MZ B cell compartment is capable of generating variable and diverse antibody responses.",M2
17196977,"Function blocking antibodies to neuropilin-1 generated from a designed human synthetic antibody phage library.Non-immune (naïve) antibody phage libraries have become an important source of human antibodies. The synthetic phage antibody library described here utilizes a single human framework with a template containing human consensus complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>). Diversity of the libraries was introduced at select CDR positions using tailored degenerate and trinucleotide codons that mimic natural human antibodies. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a cell-surface receptor for both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and class 3 semaphorins, is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons. NRP1 is required for vascular development and is expressed widely in the developing vasculature. To investigate the possibility of function blocking antibodies to NRP1 as potential therapeutics, and study the consequence of targeting NRP1 in murine tumor models, panels of antibodies that cross-react with human and murine NRP1 were generated from a designed antibody phage library. Antibody (YW64.3) binds to the CUB domains (a1a2) of NRP1 and completely blocks Sema3A induced neuron collapse; antibody (YW107.4.87) binds to the coagulation factor V/VIII domains (b1b2) of NRP1 and blocks VEGF binding and VEGF induced cell migration. YW107.4.87 inhibits tumor growth in animal xenograft models. These antibodies have provided valuable tools to study the roles of NRP1 in vascular and tumor biology.",M2
16864082,"[Effects of T cell receptor gene rearrangement on BV CDR3 in Jurkat cells]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of T cell receptor (TCR) BD2-BJ2 gene rearrangement on the complementary-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 of TCR beta chain (TCR BV CDR3) in Jurkat cells. METHODS: TCR BV gene subfamilies were detected by RT-PCR in Jurkat cells during proliferation and after induction with non-specific T cell activators and SEA, respectively. To determine the clonality of TCR BV subfamilies and the lengths of CDR3, the PCR products were analyzed by TCR GeneScan technique, and the sequences of CDR3 were further analyzed by DNA sequencer. RESULTS: No new TCR BV subfamilies were found in Jurkat cells, a monoclonal BV8(+)cell line, either during cell proliferation or after stimulation with different treatments, nor were any differences found in CDR3 size or sequences. CONCLUSION: TCR BD2-BJ2 rearrangement in Jurkat cells may not play a role in modification of TCR BV CDR3 domains or the consequent antigen immunorecognition of BV CDR3, but the possibility of TCR modification can not be excluded.",M2
16778135,"Conformation-specific blockade of the integrin GPIIb/IIIa: a novel antiplatelet strategy that selectively targets activated platelets.Platelet activation causes conformational changes of integrin GPIIb/IIIa (alpha(IIb)beta3), resulting in the exposure of its ligand-binding pocket. This provides the unique possibility to design agents that specifically block activated platelets only. We used phage display of single-chain antibody (scFv) libraries in combination with several rounds of depletion/selection to obtain human scFvs that bind specifically to the activated conformation of GPIIb/IIIa. Functional evaluation of these scFv clones revealed that fibrinogen binding to human platelets and platelet aggregation can be effectively inhibited by activation-specific scFvs. In contrast to clinically used GPIIb/IIIa blockers, which are all conformation unspecific, activation-specific GPIIb/IIIa blockers do not induce conformational changes in GPIIb/IIIa or outside-in signaling, as evaluated by ligand-induced binding-site (LIBS) exposure in flow cytometry or P-selectin expression in immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. In contrast to the conformation-unspecific blocker abciximab, activation-specific scFvs permit cell adhesion and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, which is mediated by nonactivated GPIIb/IIIa. Mutagenesis studies and computer modeling indicate that exclusive binding of activation-specific scFv is mediated by RXD motifs in the heavy-chain complementary-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 of the antibodies, which in comparison with other antibodies forms an exceptionally extended loop. In vivo experiments in a ferric-chloride thrombosis model of the mouse carotid artery demonstrate similar antithrombotic potency of activation-specific scFv, when compared with the conformation-unspecific blockers tirofiban and eptifibatide. However, in contrast to tirofiban and eptifibatide, bleeding times are not prolonged with the activation-specific scFvs, suggesting lower bleeding risks. In conclusion, activation-specific GPIIb/IIIa blockade via human single-chain antibodies represents a promising novel strategy for antiplatelet therapy.",M2
16735466,"A peptide based on the complementarity-determining region 1 of an autoantibody ameliorates lupus by up-regulating CD4+CD25+ cells and TGF-beta.Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies and systemic clinical manifestations. A peptide, designated hCDR1, based on the complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 1 of an autoantibody, ameliorated the serological and clinical manifestations of lupus in both spontaneous and induced murine models of lupus. The objectives of the present study were to determine the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects induced by hCDR1. Adoptive transfer of hCDR1-treated cells to systemic lupus erythematosus-afflicted (NZBxNZW)F1 female mice down-regulated all disease manifestations. hCDR1 treatment up-regulated (by 30-40%) CD4+CD25+ cells in association with CD45RBlow, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, and Foxp3 expression. Depletion of the CD25+ cells diminished significantly the therapeutic effects of hCDR1, whereas administration of the enriched CD4+CD25+ cell population was beneficial to the diseased mice. Amelioration of disease manifestations was associated with down-regulation of the pathogenic cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma and IL-10) and up-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta, which substantially contributed to the suppressed autoreactivity. TGF-beta was secreted by CD4+ cells that were affected by hCDR1-induced immunoregulatory cells. The hCDR1-induced CD4+CD25+ cells suppressed autoreactive CD4+ cells, resulting in reduced rates of activation-induced apoptosis. Thus, hCDR1 ameliorates lupus through the induction of CD4+CD25+ cells that suppress activation of the autoreactive cells and trigger the up-regulation of TGF-beta.",M2
19127743,"Selection, characterization, and <e>CDR</e> shuffling of naive llama single-domain antibodies selected against auxin and their cross-reactivity with auxinic herbicides from four chemical families.Indoleacetic acid (IAA)-binding single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) were isolated from a naive phage-display library constructed from the heavy chain antibody repertoire of a Ilama. The highest-affinity sdAb isolated (CSF2A) had a K(D) of 5-20 microM for two IAA-protein conjugates and a K(D) of 20 microM for free IAA. This sdAb also bound to a synthetic auxin analogue, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and to six auxinic herbicides (K(D) values of 0.5-2 mM), but not to serotonin and tryptophan, which are structurally similar to IAA but have no auxinic activity. To understand how sdAb CSF2A binds IAA and to determine which complementary-determining region(s) (CDR) participate(s) most in binding IAA, CSF2A was shuffled with four other sdAb clones by staggered extension process (StEP). After panning against IAA, two shuffled sdAbs were found: sdAb CSB1A, which originated from three different parental clones, and sdAb CSE8A, derived from two parental clones. These shuffled sdAbs and CSF2A were each fused to the B subunit of the Escherichia coli verotoxin, resulting in the formation of the pentamerized sdAbs V2NCSB1A, V2NCSE8A, and V2NCSF2A, which were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) along with the sdAbs previously isolated. The shuffled clones had affinity for IAA (20 microM) similar to that of the highest affinity parental clone CSF2A, but much lower affinity for the auxinic herbicides. CDR2 was instrumental in binding IAA, whereas hydrophobic CDR3 was important for binding the auxinic herbicides. A novel SPR methodology is also described for specific immobilization of pentamerized sdAbs, allowing determination of K(D) values of Ab interaction with underivatized, low molecular weight haptens.",M2
16520393,"Structure and binding kinetics of three different human CD1d-alpha-galactosylceramide-specific T cell receptors.Invariant human TCR Valpha24-Jalpha18+/Vbeta11+ NKT cells (iNKT) are restricted by CD1d-alpha-glycosylceramides. We analyzed crystal structures and binding characteristics for an iNKT TCR plus two CD1d-alpha-GalCer-specific Vbeta11+ TCRs that use different TCR Valpha chains. The results were similar to those previously reported for MHC-peptide-specific TCRs, illustrating the versatility of the TCR platform. Docking TCR and CD1d-alpha-GalCer structures provided plausible insights into their interaction. The model supports a diagonal orientation of TCR on CD1d and suggests that complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>)3alpha, CDR3beta, and CDR1beta interact with ligands presented by CD1d, whereas CDR2beta binds to the CD1d alpha1 helix. This docking provides an explanation for the dominant usage of Vbeta11 and Vbeta8.2 chains by human and mouse iNKT cells, respectively, for recognition of CD1d-alpha-GalCer.",M2
16475992,"Detailed analysis of the E2-IgM complex in hepatitis C-related type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a major role in the induction of type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MCII). The role of HCV proteins and virus-host interaction in the pathogenesis of MC remains to be defined. To address this issue, we have characterized, in detail, the monoclonal IgM and the viral component of circulating immune complexes in eight patients with HCV-associated MCII. The proportion of HCV-RNA compartmentalized in the cryoprecipitate (CP) varied greatly (10-80% of total HCV-RNA). The complementary determining region (<e>CDR</e>)3 sequences of monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) VH and VK genes were highly homologous to rheumatoid factor and to antibodies against HCV-E2. Furthermore, the CDR3 sequences in some of our MCII patients were highly similar to those described in HCV-positive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). From these results, it appears that, as in the case of NHL, the IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) production in MCII patients is antigen driven, namely by E2. However, the limited number of mutations in VH and VK genes with respect to the germline and their distribution showed that the B-cell response in these cases was prevented from undergoing affinity maturation. Furthermore, in patients with monoclonal IgM and definite compartmentalization of HCV in either CP or supernatant, a highly homogeneous E2-hypervariable region (HVR)1 sequence distribution was found (90-100% identical clones), a feature of the quasispecies frequently associated with an impaired humoral immune response to HCV. These findings suggest that in patients with HCV-associated MCII, maturation of monoclonal B lymphocytes may be blocked in a primitive stage preventing serious damaging effects because of the auto-reactivity of their secreted immunoglobulins.",M2
16474160,"Effect of epitope position on neutralization by anti-human immunodeficiency virus monoclonal antibody 2F5.The membrane-proximal region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane protein (TM) is critical for envelope (Env)-mediated membrane fusion and contains the target for broadly reactive neutralizing antibody 2F5. It has been proposed that 2F5 neutralization might involve interaction of its long, hydrophobic, complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) H3, with adjacent viral membrane. Using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a tool, we examined the effect of epitope position on 2F5 neutralization. When the 2F5 epitope was inserted in the proline-rich region of MLV Env surface protein (SU), 2F5 blocked cell fusion and virus infection, whereas MLV with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the same position was not neutralized by anti-HA, even though the antibodies bound their respective Envs on the surface of infected cells and viruses equally well. When the 2F5 epitope was inserted in the MLV Env TM at a position comparable to its natural position in HIV-1 TM, 2F5 antibody blocked Env-mediated cell fusion. Epitope position had subtle effects on neutralization by 2F5: the antibody concentration for 50% inhibition of cell fusion was more than 10-fold lower when the 2F5 epitope was in SU than in TM, and inhibition was less complete at high concentrations of antibody; we discuss possible explanations for these effects of epitope position. Since membrane proximity was not required for neutralization by 2F5 antibody, we speculate that the CDR H3 of 2F5 contributes to neutralization by destabilizing an adjacent protein rather than by inserting into an adjacent membrane.",M2
16455793,"Shared blood and muscle CD8+ T-cell expansions in inclusion body myositis.Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most frequent inflammatory myopathy over the age of fifty. Pathological findings suggest that two processes may contribute to IBM pathogenesis: a primary degenerative process affecting muscle fibre and/or an autoimmune process mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I-restricted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that muscle-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in IBM display restricted expression of T-cell receptor (TCR)-BV families or evidenced oligoclonal T-cell expansions. This study was performed to investigate whether blood T cells similarly exhibit clonal expansions due to the recirculation of muscle-infiltrating T cells in the periphery. For this, we studied the T-cell repertoire of 17 IBM patients by complementarity-determining-region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 length distribution (immunoscope) analysis of TCR-B transcripts. Mean age was 68 years (range 53-88) and mean duration of the disease was 6.5 years (2-20). Oligoclonal T-cell expansions were observed in the blood of IBM patients. The quantitative average perturbation D index was significantly increased in IBM patients [D = 13.7% +/- 1.2%, mean +/- standard error of measurement (SEM)] as compared with 17 age-matched controls suffering from connective tissue diseases not associated with T-cell repertoire perturbation, that is, dermatomyositis (DM) and systemic sclerosis (9.3 +/- 0.6%, P &lt; 0.005). Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the level of blood perturbation and muscle inflammation. Sorting experiments showed that these perturbations were due to oligoclonal expansions of CD8+ T cells. In the three IBM patients analysed, we could relate the blood expansions to T-cell clones also found in muscle. The clonally expanded blood T cells dramatically responded to interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vitro, suggesting that they had been primed in vivo, presumably in response to yet unknown muscle auto-antigens. Together, our results indicate that clonally expanded muscle-infiltrating CD8+ T cells re-circulate in the blood and support the concept of a CD8+ T-cell-mediated autoimmune component in IBM, similarly to what is observed in polymyositis (PM).",M2
16426633,"Structural mimicry of CD4 by a cross-reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibody with <e>CDR</e>-H2 and H3 containing unique motifs.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into cells is initiated by the binding of its envelope glycoprotein (Env) gp120 to receptor CD4. Antibodies that bind to epitopes overlapping the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on gp120 can prevent HIV entry by competing with cell-associated CD4; their ability to outcompete CD4 is a major determinant of their neutralizing potency and is proportional to their avidity. The breadth of neutralization and the likelihood of the emergence of antibody-resistant virus are critically dependent on the structure of their epitopes. Because CD4bs is highly conserved, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antibodies closely mimicking CD4 could exhibit relatively broad cross-reactivity and a high probability of preventing the emergence of resistant viruses. Previously, in a search for antibodies that mimic CD4 or the co-receptor, we identified and characterized a broadly cross-reactive HIV-neutralizing CD4bs human monoclonal antibody (hmAb), m18. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Fab m18 at 2.03 A resolution, which reveals unique conformations of heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 (H2 and H3). H2 is highly bulged and lacks cross-linking interstrand hydrogen bonds observed in all four canonical structures. H3 is 17.5 A long and rigid, forming an extended beta-sheet decorated with an alpha-turn motif bearing a phenylalanine-isoleucine fork at the apex. It shows striking similarity to the Ig CDR2-like C'C'' region of the CD4 first domain D1 that dominates the binding of CD4 to gp120. Docking simulations suggest significant similarity between the m18 epitope and the CD4bs on gp120. Fab m18 does not enhance binding of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, nor does it induce CD4-independent fusion mediated by the HIV Env. Thus, vaccine immunogens based on the m18 epitope structure are unlikely to elicit antibodies that could enhance infection. The structure can also serve as a basis for the design of novel, highly efficient inhibitors of HIV entry.",M2
16407221,"Construction, affinity maturation, and biological characterization of an anti-tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 humanized antibody.The tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 is expressed in the majority of human adenocarcinomas but is rarely expressed in most normal tissues, which makes it a potential target for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of human cancers. Here we describe the construction, affinity maturation, and biological characterization of an anti-TAG-72 humanized antibody with minimum potential immunogenicity. The humanized antibody was constructed by grafting only the specificity-determining residues (SDRs) within the complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) onto homologous human immunoglobulin germ line segments while retaining two mouse heavy chain framework residues that support the conformation of the CDRs. The resulting humanized antibody (AKA) showed only about 2-fold lower affinity compared with the original murine monoclonal antibody CC49 and 27-fold lower reactivity to patient serum compared with the humanized antibody HuCC49 that was constructed by CDR grafting. The affinity of AKA was improved by random mutagenesis of the heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3). The highest affinity variant (3E8) showed 22-fold higher affinity compared with AKA and retained the original epitope specificity. Mutational analysis of the HCDR3 residues revealed that the replacement of Asn(97) by isoleucine or valine was critical for the affinity maturation. The 3E8 labeled with (125)I or (131)I showed efficient tumor targeting or therapeutic effects, respectively, in athymic mice with human colon carcinoma xenografts, suggesting that 3E8 may be beneficial for the diagnosis and therapy of tumors expressing TAG-72.",M2
16406527,"Initial repertoire of anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl) antibodies as potential donors for effective affinity maturation.We previously found that there are two distinct antibody (Ab) maturation pathways for the immune response of C57BL/6 mice to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP), one involving Abs with high evolvability (group-H) and the other involving Abs with low evolvability (group-L). Commitment to whichever pathway is followed pre-determined in B cells at an early developmental stage. Candidates for the group-L or -H pathway are thus expected to pre-exist in the initial repertoire of the immune response. In the present study, we examined the initial Ab repertoire from the viewpoint of the latent potential of these Abs for effective affinity maturation. At first, we prepared anti-NP B cell hybridomas at 1 week postimmunization. Although the diversity of the obtained repertoire was maintained mainly by the third complementarity determining region of the heavy chain (<e>CDR</e>-H3), their changes in the near UV circular dichroism resulting from NP-binding allowed for classification into three groups according to the same rules applied in the pathway classification of the maturated Abs. This suggested that the innate structural properties of CDR-H3 were conserved throughout maturation. In other words, in exploring the structure of CDR-H3, it is possible to distinguish the latent potentials of Abs in effective affinity maturation even those making up the initial Ab repertoire. We then examined an artificially designed group-H Ab prototype and found its NP-binding ability sufficient for engagement in the initial repertoire. The question arose here as to why the majority of the actual initial repertoire consisted of the group-L ancestors regardless of their middling NP-binding affinity, which called for further discussion from the viewpoint of the dynamics possibly shaping the repertoire.",M2
16363876,"The increased flexibility of <e>CDR</e> loops generated in antibodies by Congo red complexation favors antigen binding.The dye Congo red and related self-assembling compounds were found to stabilize immune complexes by binding to antibodies currently engaged in complexation to antigen. In our simulations, it was shown that the site that becomes accessible for binding the supramolecular dye ligand is located in the V domain, and is normally occupied by the N-terminal polypeptide chain fragment. The binding of the ligand disrupts the beta-structure in the domain, increasing the plasticity of the antigen-binding site. The higher fluctuation of CDR-bearing loops enhances antigen binding, and allows even low-affinity antibodies to be engaged in immune complexes. Experimental observations of the enhancement effect were supported by theoretical studies using L lambda chain (4BJL-PDB identification) and the L chain from the complex of IgM-rheumatoid factor bound to the CH3 domain of the Fc fragment (1ADQ-PDB identification) as the initial structures for theoretical studies of dye-induced changes. Commercial IgM-type rheumatoid factor (human) and sheep red blood cells with coupled IgG (human) were used for experimental tests aimed to reveal the dye-enhancement effect in this system. The specificity of antigen-antibody interaction enhanced by dye binding was studied using rabbit anti-sheep red cell antibodies to agglutinate red cells of different species. Red blood cells of hoofed mammals (horse, goat) showed weak enhancement of agglutination in the presence of Congo red. Neither agglutination nor enhancement were observed in the case of human red cells. The dye-enhancement capability in the SRBC-antiSRBC system was lost after pepsin-digestion of antibodies producing (Fab)2 fragments still agglutinating red cells. Monoclonal (myeloma) IgG, L lambda chain and ovoalbumin failed to agglutinate red cells, as expected, and showed no enhancement effect. This indicates that the enhancement effect is specific.",M2

Humanization of mAbs by simple <e>CDR</e>-grafting often results in loss of affinity because certain framework residues of the antibody variable regions can participate in antigen-antibody interaction. In this study, humanization of chicken mAbs was achieved by CDR-grafting, followed by framework fine-tuning using a chicken phage-displayed mAb, phAb4-31, as a model antibody. In order to fine-tune the framework, we used the phage-displayed combinatorial library with permutation of important framework residues. After panning the humanized library, the  most humanized  variants were selected and analyzed for antigen-binding activity. All of these clones retained affinity comparable to the parental chicken mAb. These results suggest that chicken mAbs can easily be humanized, and thus humanized chicken mAbs may be practically applied as therapeutic agents.",M2
16272317,"A single DH gene segment creates its own unique <e>CDR</e>-H3 repertoire and is sufficient for B cell development and immune function.To test the contribution of individual D gene segments to B cell development and function, we used gene targeting to create mice that contain only DFL16.1 in the DH locus. We term this D-limited IgH allele DeltaD-DFL. Although the absolute number of IgM+IgD- B cells in the bone marrow was decreased, homozygous DeltaD-DFL BALB/c mice contained normal numbers of IgM+IgD+ B cells in bone marrow and spleen and normal numbers of B1a, B1b, and B2 cells in the peritoneal cavity. Bone marrow IgM+IgD+ B cells express a CDR-H3 repertoire similar in length and amino acid composition to the DFL16.1 subset of the wild-type BALB/c repertoire but divergent from sequences that do not contain DFL16.1. This similarity in content is the product of both germline bias and somatic selection, especially in the transition to the mature IgM+IgD+ stage of development. Serum Ig concentrations and the humoral immune response to a T-dependent Ag ([4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl]acetyl hapten) were nearly identical to wild-type littermate controls. A greater variance in the immune response to the T-independent Ag (alpha(1--&gt;3)-dextran) was observed in DeltaD-DFL homozygotes, with half of the mice exhibiting levels below the range exhibited by controls. Although limited to a repertoire specific to DFL16.1, the presence of a single DH gene segment of normal sequence was sufficient for development of normal numbers of mature B cells and for robust humoral immune function.",M2
16257268,"Amelioration of SLE-like manifestations in (NZBxNZW)F1 mice following treatment with a peptide based on the complementarity determining region 1 of an autoantibody is associated with a down-regulation of apoptosis and of the pro-apoptotic factor JNK kinase.Treatment with peptides based on the complementarity determining regions (<e>CDR</e>) of murine and human monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies that bear the common idiotype, 16/6 Id, ameliorates disease manifestations of mice with either induced or spontaneous SLE. Aberrant expression and function of the p21Ras/MAP kinase pathway are associated with active SLE. Therefore, we examined the effect of treatment with a CDR1-based peptide of a human autoantibody (hCDR1) on the p21Ras pathway and SLE manifestations of SLE-prone (NZBxNZW)F1 mice. Untreated SLE-afflicted mice demonstrated increased expression of p21Ras and the phosphorylated active form of its down-stream element JNK kinase in conjunction with reduced hSOS and unchanged p120GAP, as compared to healthy controls. Amelioration of SLE manifestations following treatment with hCDR1 was associated with a diminished expression of phosphorylated JNK kinase, mainly in the T cell population that also exhibited reduced rates of apoptosis. Thus, hCDR1 therapy ameliorates SLE, at least in part, via down-regulation of the activity of the pro-apoptotic JNK kinase.",M2
16199666,"Structure of a shark IgNAR antibody variable domain and modeling of an early-developmental isotype.The new antigen receptor (IgNAR) antibodies from sharks are disulphide bonded dimers of two protein chains, each containing one variable and five constant domains. Three types of IgNAR variable domains have been discovered, with Type 3 appearing early in shark development and being overtaken by the antigen-driven affinity-matured Type 1 and 2 response. Here, we have determined the first structure of a naturally occurring Type 2 IgNAR variable domain, and identified the disulphide bond that links and stabilizes the CDR1 and CDR3 loops. This disulphide bridge locks the CDR3 loop in an  upright  conformation in contrast to other shark antibody structures, where a more lateral configuration is observed. Further, we sought to model the Type 3 isotype based on the crystallographic structure reported here. This modeling indicates (1) that internal Type 3-specific residues combine to pack into a compact immunoglobulin core that supports the <e>CDR</e> loop regions, and (2) that despite apparent low-sequence variability, there is sufficient plasticity in the CDR3 loop to form a conformationally diverse antigen-binding surface.",M2
16195545,"A mutation designed to alter crystal packing permits structural analysis of a tight-binding fluorescein-scFv complex.The structure of the scFv fragment FITC-E2, obtained from a naive phage antibody scFv library derived from human donors, was determined at 2.1 A resolution in the free form and at 3.0 A in the complexed form. The wild-type (wt) scFv binds fluorescein with a K(D) of 0.75 nM. The free scFv readily crystallizes by compacting its 18 amino acid-long <e>CDR</e>-H3, partially occluding the binding site and further blocking access by binding to the  bottom  of a neighboring scFv molecule with a cluster of exposed aromatic residues within CDR-H3. Only upon mutating one of the residues involved in this dominant crystal contact, an exposed tryptophan in the middle of CDR-H3, crystals of the complex could be obtained. A series of alanine mutants within the putative antigen binding site, covering a range of binding affinities, were used to relate macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic binding parameters to single-molecule disruption forces measured by AFM. The effects of the mutations on the binding properties, particularly on the fraction of binding-competent molecules within the population, cannot be fully explained by changes in the strength of local interactions. The significant conformational change of CDR-H3 between the free and the liganded form illustrates the plasticity of the binding site. An accompanying study in this issue by Curcio and colleagues presents the molecular dynamics simulation of the forced unbinding experiments and explores possible effects of the mutations on the unbinding pathway of the hapten.",M2
16189008,"Structure of the Fab fragment of F105, a broadly reactive anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody that recognizes the CD4 binding site of HIV type 1 gp120.We have determined the crystal structure of the Fab fragment from F105, a broadly reactive human antibody with limited potency that recognizes the CD4 binding site of gp120. The structure reveals an extended <e>CDR</e> H3 loop with a phenylalanine residue at the apex and shows a striking pattern of serine and tyrosine residues. Modeling the interaction between gp120 and F105 suggests that the phenylalanine may recognize the binding pocket of gp120 used by Phe(43) of CD4 and that numerous tyrosine and serine residues form hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of gp120. A comparison of the F105 structure to that of immunoglobulin G1 b12, a much more potent and broadly neutralizing antibody with an overlapping epitope, suggests similarities that contribute to the broad recognition of human immunodeficiency virus by both antibodies. While the putative epitope for F105 shows significant overlap with that predicted for b12, it appears to differ from the b12 epitope in extending across the interface between the inner and outer domains of gp120. In contrast, the CDR loops of b12 appear to interact predominantly with the outer domain of gp120. The difference between the predicted epitopes for b12 and F105 suggests that the unique potency of b12 may arise from its ability to avoid the interface between the inner and outer domains of gp120.",M2
16183303,"Structure of a non-camelized human M12-V(H) domain at 1.5A resolution.A non-camelized human V(H) domain has been crystallized through limited in vitro proteolysis of scFvM12 antibody fragment. The protease addition results in the complete degradation of the M12-V(L) domain, linker, and purification tags. The structure solved up to 1.5A resolution having good stereochemistry with a R(cryst) factor of 15.8% and R(free) factor of 19.7%. Dihedral angle values comparison of the first and the second complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) of M12-V(H) domain with an average values show a significant deviation; therefore, M12-V(H) domain structure indicates either the existence of a new canonical subclass or a link among the subclasses of canonical main-chain conformation in V(H)3 family. The presence of uncommon hydrogen bond between Ser-H50 and Tyr-H97 has pulling effect on CDR-H3 loop. The interface area buried by CDR-H3 loop indicates the partial coverage of the hydrophobic V(L)-V(H) interface. The isolated M12-V(H) domain was found soluble up to 0.35 mM. This result would be helpful in structure based designing of an isolated human single domain antibody fragments for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications such as cancer.",M2
16162266,"Problems in using statistical analysis of replacement and silent mutations in antibody genes for determining antigen-driven affinity selection.The analysis of molecular signatures of antigen-driven affinity selection of B cells is of immense use in studies on normal and abnormal B cell development. Most of the published literature compares the expected and observed frequencies of replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations in the complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) and the framework regions (FRs) of antibody genes to identify the signature of antigenic selection. The basic assumption of this statistical method is that antigenic selection creates a bias for R mutations in the CDRs and for S mutations in the FRs. However, it has been argued that the differences in intrinsic mutability among different regions of an antibody gene can generate a statistically significant bias even in the absence of any antigenic selection. We have modified the existing statistical method to include the effects of intrinsic mutability of different regions of an antibody gene. We used this method to analyse sequences of several B cell-derived monoclonals against T-dependent antigens, T-independent antigens, clones derived from lymphoma and amyloidogenic clones. Our sequence analysis indicates that even after correcting for the intrinsic mutability of antibody genes, statistical parameters fail to reflect the role of antigen-driven affinity selection in maturation of many clones. We suggest that, contrary to the basic assumption of such statistical methods, selection can act both for and against R mutations in the CDR as well as in the FR regions. In addition we have identified different methodological difficulties in the current uses of such statistical analysis of antibody genes.",M2
16143985,"High variability in complementarity-determining regions compensates for a low number of V gene families in the lambda light chain locus of the platypus.Based on the analysis of a panel of variable (V) region sequences from the Australian duck-billed platypus and the Australian short beaked echidna, the monotremes were found to express a highly diversified Vlambda repertoire. High variability was observed both in sequence and in length of all three <e>CDR</e> regions. However, all monotreme sequences were found to form a separate branch on a distance tree, and the monotremes appear to express only two Vlambda gene families. The appearance of all Vlambda gene segments in one branch on the distance tree gives further support for the notion that deletions of entire V region clans or families, followed by successive rounds of gene duplications may be a relatively common phenomenon during vertebrate evolution. Four different constant region sequences were also identified and a preferential use of certain J segments to each constant region was observed. A more detailed picture of the locus was obtained by analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blot and PCR. The organization of the lambda locus involves multiple V and several constant region genes with one or several joining segments positioned upstream of each constant region, similar to the organization in mouse and man. An mRNA frequency analysis shows that the lambda light chain accounts for more than 90% of the light chain transcripts in the spleen. The abundance and the high variability indicate that light chain diversity at the lambda locus contributes significantly to the antigen-binding repertoire in monotremes. A high lambda to kappa light chain ratio also indicates that variability in the CDR regions is more important for the repertoire size than the total number of V gene families.",M2
16095608,"Identification of a universal VHH framework to graft non-canonical antigen-binding loops of camel single-domain antibodies.Camel single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) are promising tools in numerous biotechnological and medical applications. However, some conditions under which antibodies are used are so demanding that they can be met by only the most robust VHHs. A universal framework offering the required properties for use in various applications (e.g. as intrabody, as probe in biosensors or on micro-arrays) is highly valuable and might be further implemented when employment of VHHs in human therapy is envisaged. We identified the VHH framework of cAbBCII10 as a potential candidate, useful for the exchange of antigen specificities by complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) grafting. Due to the large number of CDR-H loop structures present on VHHs, this grafting technique was expected to be rather unpredictable. Nonetheless, the plasticity of the cAbBCII10 framework allows successful transfer of antigen specificity from donor VHHs onto its scaffold. The cAbBCII10 was chosen essentially for its high level of stability (47 kJmol(-1)), good expression level (5 mgl(-1) in E.coli) and its ability to be functional in the absence of the conserved disulfide bond. All five chimeras generated by grafting CDR-Hs, from donor VHHs belonging to subfamily 2 that encompass 75% of all antigen-specific VHHs, on the framework of cAbBCII10 were functional and generally had an increased thermodynamic stability. The grafting of CDR-H loops from VHHs belonging to other subfamilies resulted in chimeras of reduced antigen-binding capacity.",M2
15950725,"Identification of novel VH1/J558 immunoglobulin germline genes of C57BL/6 (Igh b) allotype.Although a rich database of Igh a allotype mouse immunoglobulin germline genes exists, current information on Igh b allotype immunoglobulin germline genes is limited. Among the immunoglobulin VH genes, single-cell amplified from six Igh b (C57BL/6 background) spleens in this study, 602 clonally independent immunoglobulin VH sequences belonging to the VH1/J558 family were identified. Whereas 335 of these sequences could be traced to have originated from 29 different VH1/J558 germline genes deposited in the NCBI Igblast database, the remaining 267 sequences appeared to have originated from 21 novel germline genes. Of the 50 VH1/J558 germline genes utilized in the peripheral repertoire of these Igh b allotype mice, the most frequently used genes included 45.21.2, V165.1, J558.6, J558.18A, and V23. Whereas the majority of the novel genes uncovered represented allelic counterparts of previously described Balb/c (Igh a allotype) genes, some appeared to represent truly novel germline genes. Collectively, the VH1/J558 germline genes exhibited high amino acid residue usage variability at the CDR1 positions, H31, H33, and H35, and the CDR2 positions, H50, H52, H53, H54, H56, and H58. The 50 VH1/J558 germline genes expressed in the peripheral Igh b repertoire also varied widely in the net charge of their <e>CDR</e> regions, raising the possibility that they may be differentially utilized to encode anti-nuclear autoantibodies.",M2
15944280,"Development of the expressed Ig <e>CDR</e>-H3 repertoire is marked by focusing of constraints in length, amino acid use, and charge that are first established in early B cell progenitors.To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate the development of the H chain CDR3 (CDR-H3), we used the scheme of Hardy to sort mouse bone marrow B lineage cells into progenitor, immature, and mature B cell fractions, and then performed sequence analysis on V(H)7183-containing Cmu transcripts. The essential architecture of the CDR-H3 repertoire observed in the mature B cell fraction F was already established in the early pre-B cell fraction C. These architectural features include V(H) gene segment use preference, D(H) family usage, J(H) rank order, predicted structures of the CDR-H3 base and loop, and the amino acid composition and average hydrophobicity of the CDR-H3 loop. With development, the repertoire was focused by eliminating outliers to what appears to be a preferred repertoire in terms of length, amino acid composition, and average hydrophobicity. Unlike humans, the average length of CDR-H3 increased during development. The majority of this increase came from enhanced preservation of J(H) sequence. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of tyrosine. With an accompanying increase in glycine, a shift in hydrophobicity was observed in the CDR-H3 loop from near neutral in fraction C (-0.08 +/- 0.03) to mild hydrophilic in fraction F (-0.17 +/- 0.02). Fundamental constraints on the sequence and structure of CDR-H3 are thus established before surface IgM expression.",M2
15914858,"Analysis of a 17-amino acid residue, virus-neutralizing microantibody.The antibody-binding site, through which an antibody binds to its epitope, is a complex structure formed by the folding together of six complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>). However, certain peptides derived from CDR sequences retain antibody specificity and function; these are know as microantibodies (MicroAbs). For example, the F58 MicroAb is a 17 residue, cyclized peptide (CDLIYYDYEEDYYFDYC) derived from CDR-H3 of F58, an IgG1 specific for the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Both MicroAb and IgG recognize the same epitope in the V3 loop and, despite its small size, the MicroAb neutralizes the infectivity of HIV-1 IIIB only 32-fold less efficiently on a molar basis. The advantage of MicroAbs is that their small size facilitates structure-function analysis. Here, the F58 MicroAb was investigated using alanine scanning, mass spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. Neutralization of infectious IIIB was generally more sensitive to alanine substitution than binding to soluble gp120. There appeared to be a division of function within the MicroAb, with some residues involved in antigen binding (alanine substitution of 11D, 12Y or 13Y abrogated both binding and neutralization), whereas others were concerned solely with neutralization (substitution of 3L, 8Y or 14F abrogated neutralization, but not binding). The MicroAb is predominantly beta-sheet and has strong conformational constraints that are probably essential for activity. The MicroAb and soluble gp120 formed a 1 : 1 complex, with an association rate that was threefold greater than that with IgG and a faster dissociation rate. Its equilibrium dissociation constant is 37.5-fold greater than that of IgG, in line with neutralization data. This study demonstrates how MicroAbs can make a useful contribution to the understanding of antigen-antibody interactions.",M2
15878201,"Fusion protein of <e>CDR</e> mimetic peptide with Fc inhibit TNF-alpha induced cytotoxicity.The variable regions of antibodies play central roles in the binding with antigens. Based on the model of a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) neutralizing monoclonal antibody (named as Z12) with TNF-alpha, heavy chain CDR2 (HCDR2) and light chain CDR3 (LCDR3) of Z12 were found to be the most responsible to bind with TNF-alpha. A mimetic peptide (PT) was designed based on the sequence derived from HCDR2 and LCDR3. Fusion protein PT-Fc was constructed by linking PT with Fc of human IgG1 through a flexible linker (GGGGGS). The primary structural characteristics of Fc and PT-Fc were analyzed, including the flexibility, hydrophilicity and epitopes. It was demonstrated that PT and Fc in the fusion protein possessed bio-function properly and non-interfering with each other. Furthermore, PT-Fc was expressed in Escherichia coli by fusion with thioredoxin (Trx). After trx-PT-Fc was cleaved with recombinant enterokinase, PT-Fc was obtained. The results of in vitro cytotoxic assays showed that both PT and PT-Fc could efficiently inhibit TNF-alpha induced apoptosis on L929 cells. At the same micromole concentration, the inhibition activity of PT-Fc was significantly higher than PT.",M2
15848073,"Use of human germline genes in a <e>CDR</e> homology-based approach to antibody humanization.We report a new method of humanizing antibodies by complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting. Our method differs from others in that we choose human framework sequences from the set of human germline genes based on the structural similarity of the human CDRs to those of the mouse antibody to be humanized. The structural similarity is evaluated by scoring residue-to-residue homology of the mouse CDRs to human candidates with the same Chothia canonical structures. The method is illustrated with the humanization of the anti-lysozyme antibody D1.3.",M2
15848072,"SDR grafting--a new approach to antibody humanization.A major impediment to the clinical utility of the murine monoclonal antibodies is their potential to elicit human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) response in patients. To circumvent this problem, murine antibodies have been genetically manipulated to progressively replace their murine content with the amino acid residues present in their human counterparts. To that end, murine antibodies have been humanized by grafting their complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) onto the variable light (V(L)) and variable heavy (V(H)) frameworks of human immunoglobulin molecules, while retaining those murine framework residues deemed essential for the integrity of the antigen-combining site. However, the xenogeneic CDRs of the humanized antibodies may evoke anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) response in patients. To minimize the anti-Id response, a procedure to humanize xenogeneic antibodies has been described that is based on grafting, onto the human frameworks, only the specificity determining residues (SDRs), the CDR residues that are most crucial in the antibody-ligand interaction. The SDRs are identified through the help of the database of the three-dimensional structures of the antigen-antibody complexes of known structures or by mutational analysis of the antibody-combining site. An alternative approach to humanization, which involves retention of more CDR residues, is based on grafting of the 'abbreviated' CDRs, the stretches of CDR residues that include all the SDRs. A procedure to assess the reactivity of the humanized antibody to sera from patients who had been administered the murine antibody has also been described.",M2
15829286,"Despite extensive similarity in germline DH and JH sequence, the adult Rhesus macaque <e>CDR</e>-H3 repertoire differs from human.Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are frequently used models for the study and treatment of human infectious diseases, including AIDS. Confidence in the equivalence to human of the humoral immune responses of these higher primates has grown as studies of immunoglobulin germline sequences have documented average identities of 90% or greater to human counterparts. The most variable component of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, complementarity determining region 3 (CDR-H3) is the product of somatic (junctional) as well as germline (combinatorial) mechanisms of diversity. Located at the center of the antigen binding site, CDR-H3 often exerts a dominant role in antibody specificity and affinity. To test whether similarity in germline DH and JH sequence would yield similarity in CDR-H3 composition in the expressed repertoire, we compared IgM CDR-H3 transcripts from Rhesus and chimpanzee blood to human. In fetal Rhesus, the range and mean of CDR-H3 lengths was similar to that observed in fetal human. However, the Rhesus repertoire of adult muCDR-H3 transcripts did not contain the longer hypervariable intervals that humans begin to express late in the second trimester of fetal life. Conversely, the adult chimpanzee repertoire included more long CDR-H3 structures than human. The differences between these adult repertoires reflected fine changes in N addition and terminal nucleotide loss. We conclude that the same mechanisms that refine and shape CDR-H3 diversity during ontogeny can also be used to fine tune and individualize species-specific antibody repertoires despite germline immunoglobulin sequence similarity.",M2
15829267,"Adult lupus-prone MRL/MpJ2+ mice express a primary antibody repertoire that differs in <e>CDR</e>-H3 length distribution and hydrophobicity from that expressed in the C3H parental strain.Anti-dsDNA antibodies tend to be enriched for heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR-H3) intervals of above average length that contain an increased frequency of charged amino acids. It is unclear whether these types of CDR-H3s are more common in the primary B-cell repertoire of auto-immune prone strains or whether their increased prevalence in affected individuals reflects positive selection and expansion of atypical CDR-H3s in the pathogenic response to self-antigen. Here, we present evidence that when compared to C3H, a MRL/MpJ(2+) parental strain, CDR-H3 intervals from pre-B cells of adult lupus-prone MRL/MpJ(2+) mice are longer on average and are enriched for charged amino acids. The predicted prevalence of deformed loops per Shirai H3 criteria is also higher. In contrast, the frequency of charge, the distribution of length, and the pattern of predicted deformed loop structures did not differ in sequences obtained from neonates of the same two strains. These observations suggest that the mechanisms that serve to shape the initial CDR-H3 repertoire in adults, but not neonates, are being regulated differently in C3H versus MRL/MpJ(2+). Dysregulation of the adult pre-B CDR-H3 antibody repertoire could be a contributing factor for the development of florid auto-immune disease in MRL/MpJ(2+) mice.",M2
15777944,"Affinity maturation of a V(H)H by mutational hotspot randomization.V(H)Hs from naive libraries have dissociation constants (K(D)s) in the low micromolar range and thus, for most antibody applications, their intrinsic affinities need to be improved significantly. Non-targeted in vitro affinity maturation approaches based on indiscriminate randomization of complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) residues or random mutagenesis of conventional antibody variable domains have been shown to improve the affinity of recombinant antibodies by 450- to over 6000-fold. A different, targeted approach based on selective randomization of CDR codons containing AGY/RGYW nucleotide mutational hotspots i.e.,  hotspot codons , also promises to be very efficient for improving antibody affinities. Here we employed the latter approach for improving the affinity of PTH22, a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-derived peptide-specific V(H)H that was isolated from a naive llama phage display library. A PTH22 mutant ribosome display library was constructed by randomizing nine CDR2 and CDR3 hotspot codons. The affinity improvement of the lead binder was 30-fold, which seems somewhat low in view of the large number of randomized hotspot codons. Nucleotide sequence analyses of PTH22 and 23 naive V(H)Hs suggested that many AGY/RGYW mutational hotspots are not affinity mutational hotspots but play a role in V(H)H solubility, structure, and deletion/insertion events. Our results indicate that the mutagenesis approach described here is beneficial in terms of yielding moderate increases in affinity while fine-tuning physical properties of an antibody.",M2
15743031,"Construction and selection of human anti-idiotypic antibody single chain variable fragments or CDR3 fragments of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with NPC were immunized in vitro by anti-NPC monoclonal antibody FC2 and transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Detection showed that of 10 NPC patients, 8 patients' B cells immunized by FC2 and transformed by EBV produced anti-idiotypic antibodies to NPC. Five types of VH genes and 7 types of VL genes were obtained by RT-PCR amplification and then connected with (Gly4Ser)3 linker to form 14 types of scFv genes. ScFv genes digested with Sfi I were cloned into vector fUSE5 and transformed into E. coli MC 1061. Phage anti-idiotypic antibody library with 1.5 x 10(8) clones was obtained. After four rounds of panning, 270 phage clones were selected randomly and 91 FC2-positive clones were obtained by Sandwich ELISA, the positive ratio was 33.7%. 5 clones (D83, E92, G22, I50, I54), which might display beta type Ab2 scFv, were selected by binding inhibition test. These 5 phage anti-idiotypic antibodies were further analyzed by DNA sequencing. The VDJ regions of G22, I50, I54 belonged to VH4-39-D4-11-JH3-linker-V1-19-JL2, VH4-4-D4-11-JH6 and VH4-31-D4-11-JH6, respectively. E92 had the same VDJ regions with G22; D83 had the same VDJ regions with 150. So, a strategy for preparing and selecting beta type Ab2 scFv or <e>CDR</e> by means of immunization in vitro, EBV transformation and phage display technique is feasible, which paves a way for preparing cancer vaccine using beta type Ab2 scFv.",M2
15741769,"Minimizing the immunogenicity of antibodies for clinical application.The clinical utility of murine monoclonal antibodies has been greatly limited by the human anti-murine antibody responses they effect in patients. To make them less immunogenic, murine antibodies have been genetically engineered to progressively replace their murine content with that of their human counterparts. This review describes the genetic approaches that have been used to humanize murine antibodies, including the generation of mouse-human chimeric antibodies, veneering of the mouse variable regions, and the grafting of murine complementarity-determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) onto the variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) frameworks of human immunoglobulin molecules, while retaining only those murine framework residues deemed essential for the integrity of the antigen-binding site. To minimize the anti-idiotypic responses that could still be evoked by the murine CDRs in humanized antibodies, two approaches have also been described. These are based on grafting onto the human frameworks the 'abbreviated' CDRs or only the specificity-determining residues (SDRs), the CDR residues that are involved in antigen interaction. The SDRs are identified through the help of the database of three-dimensional structures of antibody:antigen complexes or by mutational analysis of the antibody-combining site. In addition, we also describe the use of in vitro affinity maturation to enhance the binding affinity of humanized antibodies, as well as the manipulation of framework residues to maximize their human content and minimize their immunogenic potential.",M2
15663940,"High-affinity, peptide-specific T cell receptors can be generated by mutations in CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3.The third complementarity-determining regions (CDR3s) of antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs) have been shown to play a major role in antigen binding and specificity. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated previously that high-affinity, peptide-specific TCRs could be generated in vitro by mutations in the CDR3alpha region of the 2C TCR. In contrast, it has been argued that CDR1 and CDR2 are involved to a greater extent than CDR3s in the process of MHC restriction, due to their engagement of MHC helices. Based on this premise, we initiated the present study to explore whether higher affinity TCRs generated through mutations in these <e>CDRs</e> or other regions would lead to significant reductions in peptide specificity (i.e. the result of greater binding energy gained through interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) helices). Yeast-display technology and flow sorting were used to select high-affinity TCRs from libraries of CDR mutants or random mutants. High-affinity TCRs with mutations in the first residue of the Valpha, CDR1, CDR2, or CDR3 were isolated. Unexpectedly, every TCR mutant, including those in CDR1 and CDR2, retained remarkable peptide specificity. Molecular modeling of various mutants suggested that such exquisite specificity may be due to: (1) enhanced electrostatic interactions with key peptide or MHC residues; or (2) stabilization of CDRs in specific conformations. The results indicate that the TCR is positioned so that virtually every CDR can contribute to the antigen-specificity of a T cell. The conserved diagonal docking of TCRs could thus orient each CDR loop to sense the peptide directly or indirectly through peptide-induced effects on the MHC.",M2
15642142,"The critical role of arginine residues in the binding of human monoclonal antibodies to cardiolipin.Previously we reported that the variable heavy chain region (VH) of a human beta2 glycoprotein I-dependent monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody (IS4) was dominant in conferring the ability to bind cardiolipin (CL). In contrast, the identity of the paired variable light chain region (VL) determined the strength of CL binding. In the present study, we examine the importance of specific arginine residues in IS4VH and paired VL in CL binding. The distribution of arginine residues in complementarity determining regions (<e>CDRs</e>) of VH and VL sequences was altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by CDR exchange. Ten different 2a2 germline gene-derived VL sequences were expressed with IS4VH and the VH of an anti-dsDNA antibody, B3. Six variants of IS4VH, containing different patterns of arginine residues in CDR3, were paired with B3VL and IS4VL. The ability of the 32 expressed heavy chain/light chain combinations to bind CL was determined by ELISA. Of four arginine residues in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to serines, two residues at positions 100 and 100 g had a major influence on the strength of CL binding while the two residues at positions 96 and 97 had no effect. In CDR exchange studies, VL containing B3VL CDR1 were associated with elevated CL binding, which was reduced significantly by substitution of a CDR1 arginine residue at position 27a with serine. In contrast, arginine residues in VL CDR2 or VL CDR3 did not enhance CL binding, and in one case may have contributed to inhibition of this binding. Subsets of arginine residues at specific locations in the CDRs of heavy chains and light chains of pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies are important in determining their ability to bind CL.",M2
15640805,"The CDR3 regions of an immunodominant T cell receptor dictate the 'energetic landscape' of peptide-MHC recognition.The energetic bases of T cell recognition are unclear. Here, we studied the 'energetic landscape' of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition by an immunodominant alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR). We quantified and evaluated the effect of natural and systematic substitutions in the complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) loops on ligand binding in the context of the structural detail of each component of the immunodominant TCR-pMHC complex. The CDR1 and CDR2 loops contributed minimal energy through direct recognition of the antigen and instead had a chief function in stabilizing the ligated CDR3 loops. The underlying energetic basis for recognition lay in the CDR3 loops. Therefore the energetic burden of the CDR loops in the TCR-pMHC interaction is variable among TCRs, reflecting the inherent adaptability of the TCR in ligating different ligands.",M2
15622442,"A peptide based on the complementarity determining region 1 of a human monoclonal autoantibody ameliorates spontaneous and induced lupus manifestations in correlation with cytokine immunomodulation.A peptide based on the sequence of the complementarity determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 1 of a human monoclonal anti-DNA autoantibody that bears the 16/6 idiotype (16/6Id) was synthesized as a potential candidate for the treatment of SLE patients. The peptide, designated hCDR1, did not induce experimental SLE upon active immunization of mice. The ability of the peptide to treat an already established lupus that was either induced in BALB/c mice or developed spontaneously in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice was tested. Ten weekly injections of hCDR1 (200, 50 microg/mouse) given subcutaneously mitigated disease manifestations (e.g., leukopenia, proteinuria and kidney damage) and resulted in a prominent reduction in the dsDNA specific antibody titers. Furthermore, treatment with hCDR1 resulted in reduced secretion and expression of the  pathogenic  cytokines [i.e., INFgamma, IL-1beta, TNFalpha (in the induced model) and IL-10], whereas the immunosuppressive cytokine TGFbeta was up-regulated. Thus, the significant ameliorating effects of hCDR1 are manifested at least partially via the immunomodulation of the cytokine profile. These results suggest that hCDR1 is a potential candidate for a novel treatment of SLE patients.",M2
15611253,"Down-regulation of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha-induced T cell chemotaxis by a peptide based on the complementarity-determining region 1 of an anti-DNA autoantibody via up-regulation of TGF-beta secretion.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be induced in mice by immunizing them with a monoclonal human anti-DNA Ab that expresses a major Id, designated 16/6Id. In addition, a peptide based on the sequence of the <e>CDR</e> 1 (hCDR1) of the 16/6Id ameliorated the clinical manifestations of SLE in experimental models. In this study we examined the effects of treating mice with human complementary-determining region 1 (hCDR1) on the subsequent chemotaxis of T cells derived from 16/6Id-primed mice. First we demonstrated elevated levels of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) in the sera of SLE-afflicted mice and in the sera and lymphoid tissues of 16/6Id-immunized BALB/c mice shortly after the immunization. We then found that administration of hCDR1 to 16/6Id-immunized mice specifically down-regulated SDF1alpha-induced T cell chemotaxis through fibronectin and collagen type I. This was accompanied by diminished SDF1-alpha-induced T cell adhesion and ERK phosphorylation. Treatment with hCDR1 up-regulated TGF-beta secretion, which, in turn, inhibited the murine T cell adhesion to and chemotaxis through fibronectin as well as their ERK phosphorylation. Thus, the secretion of TGF-beta after treatment of 16/6Id-immunized mice with hCDR1 plays an important role in the down-regulation of SDF-1alpha-mediated T cell activation and the interactions with extracellular matrix moieties observed in the present study.",M2
15604028,"A simple and rapid protocol for the sequence determination of functional kappa light chain cDNAs from aberrant-chain-positive murine hybridomas.This protocol describes the application of a polymerase chain reaction to allow the cloning and sequencing of new functional kappa light chain cDNAs from murine hybridomas co-expressing aberrant endogenous kappa chain mRNAs. The presence of kappa light chain aberrant mRNAs can hinder or even prevent determination of the sequence of functional murine kappa light chain cDNAs amplified by PCR from hybridomas. The method described here employs a panel of kappa primers in the presence of molar excess of a primer complementary to the complementary determining region (<e>CDR</e>) 3 of the known aberrant chain sequence. Analysis of the PCR products reveals two bands for some reactions: one the functional, full-length kappa chain cDNA (approximately 400 bp) and another shorter (approximately 100 bp) band corresponding to short aberrant chain kappa CDR3-constant region. The full-length product is gel purified and cloned prior to sequencing and aligned with V-region germline sequences available in NCBI and GenBank databases. This method is used routinely in our laboratory and demonstrates consistency and reliability for sequence determination of kappa light chain V-gene cDNA of mAbs to diverse antigens. This protocol is a rapid and convenient method for determining the sequence of murine V kappa region genes from hybridomas expressing aberrant kappa chain mRNAs.",M2
15491997,"In vitro antibody evolution targeting germline hot spots to increase activity of an anti-CD22 immunotoxin.Recombinant immunotoxin BL22, containing the Fv portion of an anti-CD22 antibody, produced complete remissions in most patients with drug-resistant hairy cell leukemia but had less activity in leukemias with low CD22 expression. Complementarity-determining region (<e>CDR</e>) mutagenesis is used to increase antibody affinity but can be difficult to perform successfully. We previously showed that antibodies with increased affinity and immunotoxins with increased activity could be obtained by directing mutations at specific DNA residues called hot spots. Because hot spots can arise either by somatic mutation or be present in the germline, we examined which type of hot spot is preferred for increasing antibody affinity. Initially, a second generation antibody phage-display library targeting a germline hot spot (Ser(30)-Asn(31)) within CDR1 of the antibody light chain was mutated. Substitution of serine 30 or asparagine 31 with arginine produced mutant immunotoxins with an affinity (0.8 nM) increased 7-fold over BL22 (5.8 nM) and 3-fold over the first generation mutant HA22 (2.3 nM). More importantly, a 10-fold increase in activity over BL22 and a 2-3-fold increase over HA22 were observed in various B lymphoma cell lines including WSU-CLL that contains only 5500 CD22 sites per cell. For comparison, two phage-display libraries targeting non-germline hot spots in heavy chain CDR1 and CDR3 were generated but did not produce Fv with increased affinity. Our results demonstrate that germline hot spots but not non-germline hot spots are effective for in vitro antibody affinity maturation.",M2
15386562,"High sensitivity of chemiluminescent methodology for detection of clonal CDR3 sequences in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been achieved using several radioactive labelling methodologies; however, limited information exists about the use of chemiluminescent labelling. Although many malignant disorders are related to cytogenetic alterations, there is not a consistent chromosomal translocation that could serve as a tumour marker for the monitoring of MRD. ALL are derived from B-lymphocytes in 80% of cases. In the early stages of their maturation, the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) undergo rearrangements among their V, D, and J segments, giving rise to the Complementary Determining Regions (<e>CDR</e>). Among these, CDR3 is considered unique for each lymphocyte and used as a tumour-specific marker in B-ALL patients. In this study, the CDR3 was labelled with digoxigenin and used as a patient-specific probe to test its sensitivity for further detection of MRD. Fourteen pretreatment samples of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) from B-ALL patients were included. Tumour-specific probes were designed from each clonal product by elimination of the consensus sequences. Ten digoxigenin-labelled probes were hybridized with a mixture of their respective clonal DNA and the polyclonal product from a normal healthy donor, in serial dilutions from 1:1 up to 1:10(7). A sensitivity range of 1:10(3)-1:10(6) was obtained, with an average of 1:10(5). Crossed tests performed in four patients, showed right probe specificity in all cases. We propose that the design of allele-specific probes with chemiluminescent labelling, represents a reliable, sure and sensitive alternative methodology for MRD detection in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",M2
15359585,"How well can an idiotope peptide mimic replace its parent idiotype in a synthetic peptide vaccine?PURPOSE: To determine whether a vaccine consisting of an idiotope peptide mimic of the third complementarity-determining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (<e>CDR</e>-H3) is an effective substitute for its parent idiotype. Such peptide vaccines could ultimately be used for targeting pathological B lymphocytes. METHODS: Hen egg lysozyme (HEL) conjugates of the Fab' fragment of monoclonal anti-fluorescein antibody 9-40 (Fab'-HEL) or a peptide mimic of the 9-40 CDR-H3 (referred to as the  B epitope  or  Bep,  the conjugate is referred to as  Bep-HEL ) were injected into separate cohorts of B10.A mice. Two additional control cohorts were injected with either the Bep peptide alone or a noncovalent mixture of Bep and HEL. Sera were assayed for both anti-idiotope and anti-idiotype activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Primary, secondary, and tertiary immune responses were examined. RESULTS: Both the Bep-HEL idiotope and the Fab-HEL idiotype immunogens elicited homologous, allogenic immune responses. No cross-reactivity was observed between anti-idiotope and anti-idiotype responses after primary immunization. With secondary immunization, 50% of mice immunized with the Bep-HEL conjugate exhibited a cross-reactive anti-idiotype response. Conversely, 100% of mice immunized with the Fab'-HEL conjugate exhibited a marginal, but statistically significant cross-reactive anti-idiotope response. Upon tertiary immunization, 100% of mice immunized with Bep-HEL exhibited a cross-reactive anti-idiotype response, and 55.6% of mice immunized with the Fab'-HEL conjugate exhibited a cross-reactive anti-idiotope response. CONCLUSIONS: Covalent coupling of a xenogenic carrier protein to an idiotype immunogen or its peptide mimic significantly enhances the intensity of homologous, allogenic anti-idiotype or anti-idiotope immune responses. Multiple immunizations are necessary to induce cross-reactivity between the peptide mimic and its parent idiotype.",M2
