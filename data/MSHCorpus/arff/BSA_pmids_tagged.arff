20200147,"Body surface area for adjustment of drug dose.For many drugs, it is important to adjust the dose for individual patients. To estimate the dose, a patient's body weight or body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) is often used. BSA is difficult to measure directly, but may be calculated using formulae involving the patient's weight and height. Here we discuss BSA and when it is used in practice, in particular, for calculating drug doses in children and for cancer chemotherapy.",M1
20107905,"Body size adjustments for left ventricular mass by cardiovascular magnetic resonance and their impact on left ventricular hypertrophy classification.Methods to index left ventricular (LV) mass, measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), for body size have not been investigated. The purposes of this study were to develop allometric indices for LV mass measured by CMR and compare estimates of the prevalence and predictive value of LV hypertrophy defined by a new allometric height-weight index, LV mass/body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), height indices (a new allometric height index; and previously derived indices from echocardiographic measurements: LV mass/height(2), LV mass/height(2.7)), and non-indexed LV mass. 5,004 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with CMR measurements of LV mass and no clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline were followed for a median of 4.1 years. The new indices and limits for hypertrophy (95th percentile) were derived from 822 normal-weight, normotensive, non-diabetic MESA participants. 107 events (coronary heart disease or stroke) were observed. The estimated prevalence of hypertrophy at baseline and hazard ratio for event associated with hypertrophy were 8% and 2.4 with the new allometric height-weight index, 11% and 2.2 with LV mass/BSA, 23-24% and 2.0-2.1 with height indices, and 20% and 1.7 with non-indexed LV mass. A statistically significant difference was detected between the hazard ratios based on the new height-weight index and non-indexed LV mass. The prevalence of hypertrophy is higher for indices that do not account for weight. The predictive value of hypertrophy is significantly better with the new allometric height-weight index than with non-indexed LV mass and may be better than indices without weight.",M1
20099694,"How reliable is an effective orifice area indexed chart?BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) occurs when a valvular prosthesis is too small relative to the patient's body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). The presence of PPM results in increased transprosthetic gradients and may portend a worse prognosis. It has been shown that reliable effective orifice area (EOA) data can be used to accurately predict PPM, thus preventing its occurrence. The study aim was to assess the predictive abilities of an effective orifice area indexed (EOAI) chart--the Perimount Magna EOAI chart--in the prevention of PPM. METHODS: A retrospective comparison of projected versus calculated EOA values and the predicted versus actual incidence of PPM was conducted. Forty patients with a Perimount Magna aortic bioprosthesis implanted between 1st January 2006 and 31st March 2009, were identified. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were each calculated using the Perimount Magna EOAI chart, to assess how well it could predict the incidence of postoperative PPM. RESULTS: The Perimount Magna EOAI chart had a sensitivity of 35% for predicting postoperative PPM, and an NPV of 53%. The projected EOA-values were almost invariably larger than those actually measured; this resulted in a higher proportion of patients than in whom PPM was predicted preoperatively. This EOAI chart proved to be very specific, with specificity of 100% and a PPV of 100%. CONCLUSION: The Perimount Magna EOAI chart, based on mean EOA data from a small echocardiographic cohort, represents a poor method of predicting and preventing PPM. Rather, EOAI charts should be based on reliable EOA data that reproducibly predict the expected EOA for that prosthesis.",M1
20081264,"[Left ventricular mass in children in relation to body surface area]BACKGROUND: In spite of growing interest in the problem of left ventricular hypertrophy in children there is relatively little published data on normal values of the left ventricular mass (LVM) among data on normal values in the developmental age. AIM: To determine the normal values of LVM in infants and children in relation to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), age (in months) and gender. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 773 children (403 girls and 370 boys, aged from 2 weeks to 18 yrs). They were referred for echocardiographic investigations from paediatric and neonatal hospital departments, from outpatients clinics and primary schools. In all patients cardiovascular disease was excluded. LVM (in grams) was calculated in relation to BSA, age in months and sex. All echocardiographic studies were carried out by the same investigator, according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention, modification 2D using, Philips HD14000 Ultrasonograph. The LVM values were calculated at the end of diastole from: left ventricle dimension (LVDd), interventricular septum thickness (IVSd) and thickness of the posterior wall of the left ventricle (LVPWd). Data were analysed in relation to the body surface area (in 17 consecutive intervals from 0.2 m(2) to 1.8 m(2)) and to age (in months) for all children and for girls and boys separately. LVM values were calculated as a mean +/- SD and extreme values 5 or 95 percentile. The results were accepted as normal when they did not exceed 2SD or 5(th) or 9(th) percentile. Statistic analysis was performed with the use of rank correlation Spearman test and Mann-Whitney U.test. RESULTS: The left heart ventricular mass was determined on the base of data from healty children aged 2 weeks to 18 years. A significant correlation of LVM with BSA and with age was found. There were no significant gender dependent differences in LVM values. Abnormal values exceeding the 95(th) percentile were present in 25 (3.2 %) examined children. CONCLUSIONS: 1. LVM values obtained in this study can be used as reference values. 2. No gender differences were found in LVM. 3. BSA is a good reference parameter in calculating LVM in children aged 2 weeks-18 years. Both BSA and age give high correlation with left ventricular hypertrophy, in children with left muscular ventricular mass exceeding 95 percentile or + 2SD, long term care in department of cardiology is recommended.",M1
20079934,"Obesity and smoking in patients with schizophrenia and normal controls: a case-control study.Cardiovascular risk factors, especially obesity and smoking are highly prevalent in patients with schizophrenia. Central obesity and the metabolic syndrome are conditions mostly attributed to the use of antipsychotic medication and lifestyle habits, and they constitute a significant health concern. Our study sample included 105 patients suffering from schizophrenia aged 36.25+/-10.03 and 156 normal control subjects aged 36.03+/-11.33. All patients were in- or out-patients of a private hospital. Clinical diagnosis was made according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Height, weight, waist circumference and number of cigarettes smoked daily were recorded. Duration of illness was calculated based on records concerning the age of first onset of psychotic symptoms. Body Surface Area (<e>BSA</e>) and Body Mass Index (BMI) were calculated as well as % body fat, with the use of LifeWise Body Fat Analyzers No 63-1525. The results of analysis of variance suggested a significant main effect regarding diagnosis and sex as well as for their interaction. There were significant differences between patients and controls regarding body weight, waist circumference, BMI, BSA and % body fat, with patients, especially females, being more obese than controls. The results of the present study corroborate the increased prevalence of obesity in schizophrenia. The interpretation of this finding remains unclear.",M1
20043337,"Gender-related differences in coronary artery dimensions: a volumetric analysis.BACKGROUND: Women consistently have poorer revascularization outcomes and more coronary vascular complications compared to men. This has been attributed to smaller coronary arteries, though limited data exist to support this assumption. HYPOTHESIS: By using volumetric data obtained from multidetector cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT), we sought to determine to what extent gender influences coronary artery dimensions and test the hypothesis that women would have smaller coronary dimensions even after normalizing for body surface area and cardiac mass. METHODS: CCT examinations completed on a 64-slice scanner were identified from a university cardiovascular database. Data sets from 50 women and 44 men without coronary artery disease were selected for analysis. Cross-sectional areas of proximal and distal segments of the left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (LCx), and right coronary artery (RCA) were measured, blinded to patient gender. Measurements were compared using 2-sample t tests and linear regression analysis techniques accounting for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and left ventricular (LV) mass. RESULTS: Analysis of cross-sectional coronary artery areas, unadjusted for BSA and LV mass showed smaller coronary artery size in women compared to men in the proximal portion of both the LAD (P = .01) and RCA (P = .002), but no significant difference in the remaining coronary segments. CONCLUSION: Gender significantly impacts proximal LAD and RCA size. Differences in coronary artery dimensions may explain some, but not all excess gender-related risk with coronary artery revascularization, underscoring the importance of considering multiple contributing factors.",M1
20029177,"Use of body surface area for assessing extracellular fluid volume and glomerular filtration rate in obesity.OBJECTIVE: To examine body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) for scaling extracellular fluid volume (ECV) in obesity. ECV varies less than glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a clinical population and was therefore used as a surrogate for GFR on the grounds that if BSA is unsuitable for scaling GFR, it will also be unsuitable for ECV. METHODS: GFR was measured in 917 patients using (51)Cr-EDTA. GFR scaled to ECV was measured exclusively from the slope rate constant. ECV was calculated as GFR divided by GFR/ECV. RESULTS: BSA correlated strongly with body mass index (BMI). ECV correlated strongly with BSA but the intercept was significantly lower than zero, indicating a disproportionate relation. ECV/BSA correlated with BSA but not with BMI. ECV in obese subjects was significantly less than in non-obese subjects individually matched for BSA. ECV/BSA was similar between obese and lean subjects matched for GFR/ECV and height. CONCLUSIONS: For subjects of similar BSA, a high BMI decreases ECV (the 'obesity effect'). Subjects with high BMI generally have high BSA, which tends to increase ECV/BSA because of the disproportionate relation between ECV and BSA (the 'BSA effect'). These opposing effects serendipitously and erroneously create the impression that BSA is suitable for scaling ECV (and by implication, GFR) in obesity.",M1
20012996,"On the relationship between glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine in children.The Schwartz formula (eGFR = kL/Scr, with k = 0.55) to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on length (L) and serum creatinine (Scr) has recently been updated for enzymatic serum creatinine concentrations, resulting in k = 0.413. Based on a meta-analysis, we evaluated the validity of this updated equation and other published equations for healthy children. This is the first time that publicly available data for healthy children of uncorrected and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>)-corrected median GFR have been combined with median serum creatinine values and median lengths and weights from different sources in the literature to evaluate several statistical models to estimate GFR in children. For enzymatic serum creatinine, we show that the simple model for uncorrected GFR (uGFR = k'L(3)/Scr, with k' = 1.32 x 10(-5)) and the BSA-corrected GFR (cGFR = kL/Scr, analogous to the Schwartz formula), with an important age-dependent adaptation for k (k = 0.0414 x 1n (Age) + 0.3018), correlate extremely well with chromium-51-ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) data for children between 1 month and 14 years of age. With this age-dependent modification for k, presented here, the simple bedside calculation tool derived by Schwartz can be used for screening all children for CKD. When height information is not available, the Lund-Malmö equation is an excellent alternative.",M1
20005340,"Estimation of standard liver volume in Chinese adult living donors.AIM: To determine a formula predicting the standard liver volume based on body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) or body weight in Chinese adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 115 consecutive right-lobe living donors not including the middle hepatic vein underwent right hemi-hepatectomy. No organs were used from prisoners, and no subjects were prisoners. Donor anthropometric data including age, gender, body weight, and body height were recorded prospectively. The weights and volumes of the right lobe liver grafts were measured at the back table. Liver weights and volumes were calculated from the right lobe graft weight and volume obtained at the back table, divided by the proportion of the right lobe on computed tomography. By simple linear regression analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, we correlated calculated liver volume and body height, body weight, or body surface area. RESULTS: The subjects had a mean age of 35.97 +/- 9.6 years, and a female-to-male ratio of 60:55. The mean volume of the right lobe was 727.47 +/- 136.17 mL, occupying 55.59% +/- 6.70% of the whole liver by computed tomography. The volume of the right lobe was 581.73 +/- 96.137 mL, and the estimated liver volume was 1053.08 +/- 167.56 mL. Females of the same body weight showed a slightly lower liver weight. By simple linear regression analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, a formula was derived based on body weight. All formulae except the Hong Kong formula overestimated liver volume compared to this formula. CONCLUSIONS: The formula of standard liver volume, SLV (mL) = 11.508 x body weight (kg) + 334.024, may be applied to estimate liver volumes in Chinese adults.",M1
19922057,"Body composition in 10-13-year-old children: a comparison between air displacement plethysmography and deuterium dilution.OBJECTIVE: Air diplacement plethysmography (ADP) has become increasingly popular to assess body composition in children. The aim of this study was to compare ADP with deuterium dilution and to investigate the effect of using child-specific prediction equations to correct raw body volume from ADP for thoracic gas volume (TGV) and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy Dutch children (17 girls, 20 boys) aged 10-13 years were recruited. Body volume was measured using the Bod Pod. Both adult and child-specific prediction equations were used to correct raw body volume from the Bod Pod for TGV and BSA. Total body water (TBW) was assessed using deuterium dilution. Child-specific densities and hydration fractions of fat-free mass were used to convert body volume and TBW to percentage fat mass (%FM). Correlation and agreement between methods was assessed using linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: Despite a high correlation between the Bod Pod and deuterium dilution (R=0.91, p &lt;0.001), a significant difference was found between %FM obtained using the Bod Pod and deuterium dilution (p &lt;0.001), regardless of the equation used to correct raw body volume for TGV and BSA. Bland-Altman plots showed a systematic bias towards a smaller difference between techniques at higher %FM. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in %FM were found between both methods. Given the underlying assumptions to translate body volume or TBW to %FM, it is recommended to use a 3- or 4-compartment model when assessing body composition in children.",M1
19898252,"Improving cardiovascular risk stratification in essential hypertensive patients by indexing left ventricular mass to height(2.7).AIM: Clinical abnormalities associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) only defined by left ventricular mass (LVM) indexed to height(2.7) are still undefined. We investigated the prevalence, clinical correlates and extracardiac organ damage of such a cardiac phenotype in essential hypertensive patients. METHODS: Subclinical organ damage was searched in 3719 untreated and treated hypertensive patients. LVH was defined by two sets of sex-specific criteria, namely, LVM indexed to height(2.7) (left ventricular mass index &gt;49/45 g/m in men and women, respectively) and LVM indexed to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>; left ventricular mass index &gt;125/110 g/m in men and women, respectively). Patients were categorized into three groups, according to the absence of LVH by both criteria (n = 1912, group I), presence of LVH by the height(2.7) criterion only (n = 784, group II) and presence of LVH by both criteria (n = 997, group III). A fourth group (n = 26, &lt;1%), positive for LVH only by the BSA criterion, was excluded from the analysis as being too small. RESULTS: Group II included a higher number of female, obese patients and individuals with metabolic syndrome than the other groups. Moreover, in group II, absolute LVM values and the extent of extracardiac organ damage, as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaques, microalbuminuria and retinal changes were intermediate between group I and III. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that a consistent portion of essential hypertensive patients are positive for LVH by the criterion of LVM indexed to height(2.7), but not to BSA; this population is characterized by an unhealthy metabolic profile as well as by the presence of extracardiac organ damage. They also suggest that, in order to improve cardiovascular stratification, LVM should be routinely indexed to both BSA and height(2.7) and patients categorized according to the consistency of both criteria.",M1
19886338,"Long-term follow-up of body size indices, residual renal function, and peritoneal transport characteristics in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.Technique survival in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) depends mostly on clearances in relation to body size and residual renal function (RRF). Our clinical impression has been that when RRF fails, larger patients leave CAPD sooner than smaller patients do. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) and 24-hour adequacy evaluations performed in 277 patients in a single center from 1986 through 2009 were abstracted from the existing peritoneal dialysis adequacy database. A PET (using 2 L of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution) was performed in 272 patients during the first 4 months of dialysis. Every 3 months, the patients brought their 24-hour urine and dialysate collections for adequacy evaluations and had height and weight recorded. Body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), body mass index (BMI), and total body water (TBW) were calculated. There were 1372 adequacy evaluations abstracted. The number of patients gradually declined over time because of death (28%) or transfer to other peritoneal regimens (25%) or to hemodialysis (23%). A small number of patients received a kidney graft (6%) or left CAPD for other reasons (12%); only 6% of patients remained on CAPD after 80 months of treatment. The mean (+/- standard deviation) PET 4-hour values were 0.652 +/- 0.128 for dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) ratio of creatinine (Cr), 0.403 +/- 0.0969 for 4-hour dialysate-to-initial dialysate (D/D0) glucose concentration ratio, and 2336 +/- 211 mL for the drain volume. There was no correlation between PET D/P Cr and BSA (r = 0.0051, p = 0.934), PET D/D0 glucose and BSA (r = 0.0042, p = 0.945), or PET drain volume and TBW. The correlations with other size indicators were very poor. None of the large patients (BSA &gt; 1.9 m2, weight &gt; 75 kg, BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2) remained on CAPD for more than 80 months once they lost RRF. These results confirm our impression that, with declining RRF, larger patients do not continue CAPD as long as smaller patients do.",M1
19884691,"Blood pressure control and left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive Nigerians.BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a disease characterized by end-organ complications, leading to high morbidity and mortality in many cases. People with untreated or uncontrolled hypertension often run the risk of developing complications directly associated with the disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been shown to be a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes both in patients with hypertension and in the general population. We investigated the prevalence and pattern of LVH in a treated hypertensive population at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, using non-hypertensive subjects as control. Design and Setting : A prospective observational study performed at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: Patients had 6 visits, when at least one blood pressure measurement was recorded for each hypertensive subject and average calculated for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) separately. The values obtained were used for stratification of the subjects into controlled and uncontrolled hypertension. Subjects also had echocardiograms to determine their left ventricular mass. RESULTS: LVH was found in 14 (18.2%) of the normotensive group, 40 (20.8%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive group and 14 (24.1%) of the controlled hypertensive group when left ventricular mass (LVM) was indexed to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). When LVM was indexed to height, left ventricular hypertrophy was found in none of the subjects of the normotensive group, while it was found present in 43 (22.4%) and 14 (24.1%) subjects of the uncontrolled and controlled hypertensive groups, respectively. Significant difference in the prevalence of LVH was detected only when LVM was indexed to height alone. CONCLUSION: Clinic blood pressure is an ineffective way of assessing BP control. Thus in apparently controlled hypertensive subjects, based on office blood pressure, cardiac structural changes do remain despite antihypertensive therapy. This population is still at risk of cardiovascular events.",M1
19837906,"Clinical pharmacokinetics and exposure-toxicity relationship of a folate-Vinca alkaloid conjugate EC145 in cancer patients.The clinical pharmacokinetics and exposure-toxicity relationship were determined for EC145, a conjugate of folic acid and the Vinca alkaloid desacetylvinblastine hydrazide (DAVLBH), in cancer patients. EC145 plasma concentration and toxicity data were obtained from a first-in-man phase I study and analyzed by nonlinear mixed effect modeling with NONMEM. EC145 concentration-time profile after intravenous administration was well described by a 2-compartment model with a first-order elimination process from the central compartment. <e>BSA</e> was identified as a significant covariate on EC145 clearance, accounting for 14.6% of interindividual variation on EC145 clearance. Population estimates for the clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, distribution, and elimination half-lives were 56.1 L/h, 26.1 L, 6 minutes, and 26 minutes, respectively. Constipation and peripheral neuropathy were the most common and clinically relevant toxicities. The clearance and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were significant predictors for the incidence of EC145-induced constipation but not peripheral neuropathy. In conclusion, EC145 is rapidly distributed and eliminated in cancer patients. BSA is a statistically significant covariate on EC145 clearance, but its clinical relevance remains to be defined. EC145-induced constipation occurs at a higher frequency in the patients with lower EC145 clearance, where the drug exposure tends to be higher.",M1
19785801,"[Lower costs for anticancer drugs by safety margin around calculated dose and by fine-tuning on ampoule strength]OBJECTIVE: To determine if the rational application of dose individualization of anticancer drugs leads to a reduction in costs. DESIGN: Data analysis. METHOD: At the Ikazia Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, over the first 19 weeks of 2006 the costs of the intravenous administration to patients of one or more anticancer drugs were determined. The costs of dosage based on body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) were calculated. Commercially available ampoule strengths were not taken into consideration. Using available pharmacokinetic data, it is reasonable to assume that a deviation of up to 10% based on an individualized dose calculated by body surface area, has a negligible effect on the outcome of treatment. For this reason drug costs by rounding off doses to whole ampoules were also investigated. A condition of this was that the rounded-off dose should not deviate by more than 10% from the dose calculated on body surface area. RESULTS: During the study period, 18 different anticancer drugs were administered a total of 939 times. If dosage had been based strictly on body surface area, drug costs would have been euro 509,664. Rounding off to whole ampoules with a dose margin of a maximum of 10% would have cost euro 465,619: a reduction in cost of 8.6%. CONCLUSION: The rational application of the dose individualization principle based on body surface area may result in a substantial reduction in expenditure on anticancer drugs.",M1
19721316,"[Optimization of contrast injection protocol for coronary CTA: adjustment of injection iodine volume on test bolus parameters and patients' sex and <e>BSA</e>]The purpose of this study was to correlate test bolus (TB) parameters and patient information and cardiac function with main bolus (MB) contrast density for 64-slice computed tomography, and to evaluate MB contrast density on a fixed injection rate, in comparison with an injection rate adjusted with TB parameters and patient information. A total of 256 patients underwent coronary CT angiography. In 126 patients (group 1), contrast material was administered at a flow rate of 4 ml/sec. The peak enhancement, the time needed to reach the peak of the TB and cardiac function of the MB were calculated for each patient in this group. The dependency of MB contrast attenuation on these parameters was evaluated. Significant correlations were obtained between the peak density of the TB and the patient's body surface area (BSA) with the enhancement of MB. Furthermore, females showed a higher peak enhancement of MB than males. In view of the results of group 1, in the other 130 patients (group 2) injection protocols were computed by using regression analysis of each patient's attenuation response to a TB and patient sex and BSA. Compared with group 1, the variations of MB contrast density of group 2 were reduced. Optimized contrast injection protocols are useful to reduce variations of MB contrast density, by taking these TB parameters and patient sex and BSA into account.",M1
19560413,"[Indexing glomerular filtration rate for body surface area: myth and reality]Indexing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) is often realized without arising any questions. However, physiological basis for such an indexation are very poor. Indeed, indexing GFR for BSA to avoid variation due to differences in body size necessarily implies that GFR is a linear function of BSA and that the intercept of this linear function is zero. Moreover, when GFR is indexed for BSA, the relation indexed GFR-BSA must completely disappear. These physiological prerequisites are not found for BSA indexation. We will review the history of this indexation and will underline errors and defaults. Different equations to estimate BSA exist and will be discussed. The choice of  1.73m(2)  will be also criticized. Moreover, indexing GFR for BSA has little impact on GFR results in  normal  body size population. Nevertheless, this indexation will have strong consequences in very lean (such as anorexia) and in obese patients. We will discuss possible alternatives proposed to substitute for BSA indexation.",M1
19545393,"Normal right- and left ventricular volumes and myocardial mass in children measured by steady state free precession cardiovascular magnetic resonance.BACKGROUND: Quantification of ventricular volume by steady state free precession (SSFP) cardiovascular magnetic resonance is accurate and reproducible. Normal values exist for adults, but are lacking for children.We sought to establish normal values for left and right ventricular volumes, mass and function in healthy children by using SSFP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty children (27 females, 23 males) without cardiovascular disease were evaluated. Median age was 11 years (range 7 months - 18 years), weight 35 kg (range 7-77 kg), height 146 cm (range 66-181 cm). Thirty-six examinations were performed with breath holding, 14 in freely breathing sedated children.Ventricular volumes and mass were measured in the end systolic and end diastolic phase on SSFP cine images acquired in a short axis plane as a stack of 12 contiguous slices covering full length of both ventricles. Regression analysis showed an exponential relationship between body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and ventricular volumes and mass (normal value = a*BSAb). Normative curves for males and females are presented in relation to BSA for the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and mass of both ventricles. Intra- and interobserver variability of the measurements was within the limits of 2% and 7% respectively, except for right ventricular mass (10%). CONCLUSION: The exponential equation for calculation of normal values for each ventricular parameter and graphical display of normative curves for data acquired in healthy children by SSFP cardiovascular magnetic resonance are provided.",M1
19501970,"Evaluation of mortality following severe burns injury in Hungary: external validation of a prediction model developed on Belgian burn data.PURPOSE: To evaluate mortality in a group of Hungarian burn patients and, as such, to perform an external validation of a prediction model developed on Belgian burn data by which the mortality appraisal was executed. BASIC PROCEDURES: In a historical cohort we analysed all burn patients admitted between 1998 and 2006 to the Debrecen University Hospital (n=2326). The prediction model, based on three criteria (age, burned surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and inhalation injury) was also used to evaluate several subpopulations based on gender and age. MAIN FINDINGS: Mean age was 35.3 years, mean BSA was 10.7%, 54% of the population was male, inhalation injury was rare (n=7; 0.3%) and overall mortality was 1.4% (1.6% male, 1.1% female). The men were younger and more severely burned, which was significant in every age group above 2 years. The model gave an accurate prediction of mortality, with a small overestimation in the lower risk categories. The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval: 0.89-0.98). CONCLUSION: Overall burn mortality in Hungary was low. The mortality prediction model demonstrated a high discriminative value. As such, this model is a helpful tool for outcome prediction and risk stratification for research purposes in burn patients.",M1
19454416,"Growth of mitral annulus in the pediatric patient after suture annuloplasty of the entire posterior mitral annulus.When mitral annuloplasty is performed in small children, room for annular growth should be allowed. However, it has not been reported how the valve develops after mitral annuloplasty of the entire posterior annulus. We report a case showing traces of annular growth at redo surgery. A female patient suffering from mitral valve insufficiency due to annular dilatation underwent modified Paneth plasty with Kay-Wooler commissural plication annuloplasty at the age of two years one month. In redo surgery 8.4 years after initial repair, enlargement of the commissural portion of the posterior annulus in addition to enlargement of the anterior leaflet and anterior annulus was observed. Modified Paneth plasty reinforced with a pericardial strip and Kay-Wooler annuloplasty of the posteromedial commissure were performed. Mitral orifice size measured with the Hegar dilator was 18 mm after the re-repair, increasing from 16 mm after the initial repair. Taking into account the normal mitral annulus diameter related to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) of 16 mm at initial operation and 20 mm at redo surgery, the increase in mitral orifice size from 16 mm to 18 mm in this patient may be regarded as the annular growth in 8.4 years.",M1
19452103,"[Is body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) suitable for indexing renal and dialysis clearances and other physiological parameters? A theoretical approach and a critical analysis (Part 2)]Many parameters of biological functions, interesting different branches of medicine, have to be indexed by the same value for each other comparison between single individuals or between-within groups.Body Surface Area (BSA) and 1.73 m2 reference value are probably the most used tools for indexation, but a growing number of scientific papers emphasize the risk of under or over estimates of data by BSA indexation in overweight-obese or on the contrary underweight individuals. This study has been planned to evaluate such a problem: a) by a theoretical approach, indexing to 1.73 m2 the creatinine clearance(CtCl) in an ideal population, and b) analysing and debating the doubts and problems about the indexation by BSA in many fields, the possibilities of indexation by other methods, or to use BSA with different approach, to reduce the risk of bias, evaluating the possibility of this target in a real population of 45 men and 84 women undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) - II - The feasibility to agree to an identical value of normal or abnormal renal function for every age or, on the contrary, to have a normal range for each age, are analysed and discussed.About BSA as indexing tool, it is pointed out: a) the lack of significative correlation between BSA and GFR and other parameters b) the increasing gap during years between 1.73 m2 BSA and the average BSA.",M1
19441261,"Identification of risk factors for short-term morbidity in third molar surgery.AIM: The study was designed to identify preoperative variables that may constitute important risk factors for greater degree of facial swelling, pain and trismus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 79 patients who presented for surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. Parameters such as age, sex, weight, body mass index, body surface area, and radiographic parameters such as depth of impaction, root morphology, ramus relationship, angulation of impaction, and proximity to inferior alveolar nerve {P-IAN} were measured and recorded. Swelling, trismus and pain were assessed by measuring facial dimension, inter incisal distance and using visual analogue scales respectively. The association between the preoperative parameters and extent of morbidity were determined by both a spearman correlation and multiple regression tests RESULTS: Sex, weight, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) correlated significantly with facial swelling. On the other hand, weight and body surface area were significant positive correlates of postoperative trismus. None of the preoperative variables studied correlated significantly with postoperative pain. In the regression analysis, sex, weight and BSA were also found to be significant determinants of facial swelling while postoperative pain severity was determined by sex, surface area and proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve. No statistically significant determinant of trismus was observed. CONCLUSION: Some non-operative parameters such as sex, weight and body surface area of patients are perhaps more important risk factors and determinants of individual variation of extent of morbidity than many radiographic variables to which more attention have been given in this regard. This requires further research.",M1
19430073,"Surface area in children: a simple formula.We retrospectively compared body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) using the Mosteller formula square root(H x (w/360)) and a simple weight-based BSA formula ([4Wkg+7]/ [90+Wkg]). The participants were 363 children who underwent cardiac surgery from 1991 to 2000. Their age ranged from 5 days to 18 years, weight ranged from 1.2 kg to 98 kg and height ranged from 38 cm to 178 cm. There was excellent correlation (r(2)=0.991) between Mosteller formula and the new formula (P &lt; 0.001). We propose that the weight-based formula is easy to use and accurate. It can safely replace Mosteller formula and dispense the need for time-consuming calculations.",M1
19396513,"Relationship between an effective dose of imatinib, body surface area, and trough drug levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.The standard dose of imatinib for the treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is 400 mg/day. Some patients receive reduced doses of imatinib because of serious adverse effects. Recently, the effective plasma threshold for trough imatinib levels was demonstrated to be 1,002 ng/mL. In this study, we evaluated the association of an imatinib dose with trough plasma concentrations and clinical outcomes in 31 patients with chronic-phase CML who were treated at Kumamoto University Hospital. Twenty-seven patients were optimally treated with various doses of imatinib. The mean (+/-SD) trough plasma concentrations of imatinib were 1.40 +/- 0.57 microg/mL in 13 patients receiving 400 mg/day and 1.15 +/- 0.44 microg/mL in 9 patients receiving 300 mg/day as an effective dose. Mean trough levels of the two groups were not significantly different and exceeded the effective plasma threshold. Body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) was significantly smaller in patients receiving the reduced dose compared with those receiving the standard dose (p = 0.001). The effective imatinib dose was associated with age and gender as well as BSA. A reduced dose of 300 mg/day of imatinib may be sufficient for the treatment of CML patients with smaller body size, particularly when intolerability arises.",M1
19381867,"Determinants of vessel contrast in BMI-adapted low dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering.We evaluated the determinants of vessel contrast in prospectively ECG-triggered CT coronary angiography (CTCA). Seventy patients underwent low-dose CTCA using body mass index (BMI)-adapted tube parameters and a fixed contrast material bolus. Contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was calculated from contrast (between coronaries and perivascular tissue) and image noise (standard deviation of aortic attenuation). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated from gated (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin-SPECT. Mean radiation dose was 2.13 +/- 0.69 mSv. Image noise was not affected by BMI (r = 0.1, P = 0.36), while CNR was inversely related to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) (r = -0.5, P &lt; 0.001) and CO (r = -0.45, P &lt; 0.001). After successfully overcoming the impact of BMI on image noise by adapting tube parameters, CNR mainly depends on coronary vessel contrast. The latter reflects the dilution of the contrast material by blood volume and CO, which are both correlated to BSA. Therefore, BSA adapted contrast administration may help to compensate for this effect.",M1
19359030,"Chemotherapy toxicity in gynecologic cancer patients with a body surface area (<e>BSA</e>)&gt;2 m2.OBJECTIVES: Although many clinicians practice empiric dose reduction to prevent toxicity, it is unknown whether obese patients given chemotherapy dosed according to actual body weight (ABW) experience excess toxicity. At our institution, cancer patients receive chemotherapy dosed by ABW unless on a protocol capping doses at a maximum body surface area (BSA). We compared toxicities and dose modifications between women with a BSA&gt;2 m(2) on uncapped versus capped paclitaxel as part of adjuvant paclitaxel/carboplatin for gynecologic malignancy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, women with a BSA&gt;2 m(2) treated with paclitaxel (P) and carboplatin (C) for endometrial and ovarian cancer between January 1999 and July 2007 were identified using the chemotherapy database. Records were reviewed for patient age, BSA, diagnosis, stage, standardized and actual doses for each cycle, adverse drug reactions, and dosing modifications. Statistical comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We identified 59 women with BSA&gt;2 m(2) on adjuvant P/C for endometrial and ovarian cancers. 50 received paclitaxel dosed by ABW and 9 received paclitaxel capped at a BSA of 2 m(2). There were no statistically significant differences in rates of toxicity or dose modification. CONCLUSIONS: Obese women with a BSA&gt;2 m(2) on paclitaxel dosed by ABW do not experience excess toxicity in comparison to women on paclitaxel capped at a maximum BSA or women in published trials of adjuvant P/C. Empiric dose reduction is unnecessary and may result in suboptimal treatment of obese patients. However, as this was a retrospective review, more research is needed to make definitive recommendations on this topic.",M1
19356429,"Aortic size assessment by noncontrast cardiac computed tomography: normal limits by age, gender, and body surface area.OBJECTIVES: To determine normal limits for ascending and descending thoracic aorta diameters in a large population of asymptomatic, low-risk adult subjects. BACKGROUND: Assessment of aortic size is possible from gated noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scans obtained for coronary calcium measurements. However, normal limits for aortic size by these studies have yet to be defined. METHODS: In 4,039 adult patients undergoing coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning, systematic measurements of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta diameters were made at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to detect risk factors independently associated with ascending and descending thoracic aorta diameter and exclude subjects with these parameters from the final analysis. The final analysis groups for ascending and descending thoracic aorta included 2,952 and 1,931 subjects, respectively. Subjects were then regrouped by gender, age, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) for ascending and descending aorta, separately, and for each group, the mean, standard deviation, and upper normal limit were calculated for aortic diameter as well as for the calculated cross-sectional aortic area. Also, linear regression models were used to create BSA versus aortic diameter nomograms by age groups, and a formula for calculating predicted aortic size by age, gender, and BSA was created. RESULTS: Age, BSA, gender, and hypertension were directly associated with thoracic aorta dimensions. Additionally, diabetes was associated with ascending aorta diameter, and smoking was associated with descending aorta diameter. The mean diameters for the final analysis group were 33 +/- 4 mm for the ascending and 24 +/- 3 mm for the descending thoracic aorta, respectively. The corresponding upper limits of normal diameters were 41 and 30 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Normal limits of ascending and descending aortic dimensions by noncontrast gated cardiac CT have been defined by age, gender, and BSA in a large, low-risk population of subjects undergoing CAC scanning.",M1
19330826,"Anatomy of the patent foramen ovale for the interventionalist.BACKGROUND: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an interatrial communication whose management is controversial. Several manufacturers have submitted protocols for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of their PFO closure device. The purpose of this study was to define anatomy relevant to percutaneous PFO closure, validate the clinical observation that most PFOs contain little tissue rim at the aorta, comment on proposed closure guidelines, and to discuss approaches to PFO closure. METHODS: From the Mayo Clinic Tissue Registry, five normal hearts with PFO were selected from each sex from the first 10 decades of life (n = 100). Measurements (mm) included PFO length, diameter, and distance from FO-superior vena cava (SVC) and FO-aortic annulus (AoAn). Patient age, weight, and height were obtained from autopsy reports, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) was calculated. RESULTS: PFO length and diameter increased with age (P = 0.029 and 0.001, respectively), and FO-SVC and FO-AoAn increased with BSA (P &lt;or= 0.0001 and 0.006, respectively). PFO diameter was larger in women than men (P = 0.028). Using current sizing guidelines, 66% (CI = 56-75%) of the 100 patients would have been excluded from device closure, and only 31% could have received the smallest (18 mm) device. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the proposed device closure guidelines may result in inappropriate device sizing. In addition to excluding suitable candidates, strict application of the guidelines could also result in incomplete closure or device embolization. Suggestions for modification of the guidelines and options for device closure are discussed.",M1
19322202,"Indexation of left ventricular mass to body surface area and height to allometric power of 2.7: is the difference limited to obese hypertensives?Whether left ventricular mass (LVM) should be normalized to different indexes in relation to body size is still debated. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) defined by different indexation criteria in a cohort of hypertensive subjects categorized according to body mass index (BMI). A total of 2213 essential hypertensive subjects included in the Evaluation of Target Organ Damage in Hypertension (ETODH) were divided in three groups according to BMI thresholds (&lt;25, 25-29.9 and &gt;or=30 kg m(-2)). All patients underwent extensive investigations including quantitative echocardiography. LVH was defined as an LVM index equal to or higher than (1) 125 g m(-2) in men and 110 g m(-2) in women, (2) 51 g m(-2.7) in men and 47 g m(-2.7) in women. Overall, 687 out of 2213 patients (31.0%) were found to have LVH when LVM was indexed to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and 1030 (46.5%) when indexed to height(2.7). A total of 845 patients (38.2%) had normal BMI, 954 patients (43.1%) were overweight and 414 (18.7%) were obese. Prevalence rates of LVH in the three groups were 25.1, 31.6, 41.2% by indexation to BSA and 29.9, 50.5, 71.8% by indexation to height(2.7), respectively. LVM indexed to BSA markedly underestimates LVH prevalence in obese as well as overweight hypertensive patients. To avoid a systematic misclassification of cardiovascular risk, LVM should be routinely indexed to height(2.7) in overweight and obese patients representing a large percentage of the hypertensive population.",M1
19272589,"Whole saliva flow rate and body profile in healthy young adults.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of the body profile on the whole saliva flow rate in healthy male and female subjects. STUDY DESIGN: The whole saliva flow rate was evaluated under unstimulated (UWSFR) and stimulated conditions by the gum test (SWSFR-GT) and Saxon test (SWSFR-ST), and its correlation with body profiles such as body height (BH), body weight (BW), body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and body mass index (BMI) was analysed in 100 male and 100 female subjects. RESULTS: The averages of UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST and those of BH, BW, BSA and BMI were significantly larger in males than in females (p&lt;0.0001). No correlation was observed between any of UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST and any of BH, BW, BSA and BMI for either males or females. However, UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST were significantly correlated with BH, BW and BSA when data from male and female subjects were combined. CONCLUSION: The whole saliva flow rate from an individual should only be compared with the data from the group of the same gender.",M1
19231330,"Relation of obesity to atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.The impact of obesity on risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is poorly understood. This study was performed to investigate the relation between body mass index (BMI; kilograms per square meter) or body surface area (<e>BSA</e>; square meters) and AF after CABG. Postoperative AF was assessed in a cohort of 7,027 consecutive patients without preoperative AF undergoing isolated CABG at Baylor University Medical Center from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006. Two propensity-adjusted models controlling for risk factors identified by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and other clinical/nonclinical details were used. After adjustment, BMI and BSA (modeled using smoothing techniques to avoid categorization) were strongly associated (p &lt;0.0001) with postoperative AF. Although evidence existed that gender was associated with AF (p &lt;0.0001 and p = 0.1088 for BSA and BMI models, respectively), there was no indication that the effect of BMI or BSA on postoperative AF varied by gender. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that increased BMI and BSA are associated with a higher risk of AF after CABG and that risk for men is higher for the entire BSA spectrum and for extreme values of BMI.",M1
19199010,"Covariate-based dose individualization of the cytotoxic drug indisulam to reduce the risk of severe myelosuppression.AIM: Chemotherapy with indisulam causes myelosuppression. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of patient-related covariates on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to identify patients at risk for severe myelosuppression and to develop a dosing algorithm for treatment optimization. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of 412 patients were available. Non-linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the relative risk of dose-limiting myelosuppression for various covariates (demographics, physical condition, prior treatment, comedication, CYP2C genotype and biochemistry). RESULTS: Body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), race and CYP2C genotype had a significant impact on indisulam elimination (P &lt; 0.001). Low BSA, Japanese race, variant CYP2C genotype, low baseline neutrophil and thrombocyte counts and female sex were clinically relevant risk factors of dose-limiting myelosuppression (RR &gt; 1.1). A dosing strategy was developed to optimize treatment for patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified covariates related to an increased risk of myelosuppression after indisulam therapy. Dose individualization may contribute to treatment optimization.",M1
19188924,"Obesity does not accelerate the decline in glomerular filtration rate associated with advancing age.Obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, it has also been suggested that the association between obesity and impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) arises from the invalid use of body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) for scaling. This study assesses the effect of obesity on GFR by comparing the age-dependent decline in obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m(2); n=149) and non-obese patients (n=589), aged &gt;30 years, referred for measurement of GFR (Cr-51-EDTA and three blood samples). GFR was scaled to a BSA of 1.73 m(2) (GFR/BSA) and extracellular fluid volume of 13 l (GFR/ECV), both corrected for the one-compartment assumption. When non-obese patients were categorized into 10-year age brackets (from 31 to &gt;70), GFR/BSA and GFR/ECV declined from 92 ml per min per 1.73 m(2) and 95 ml per min per 13 l, respectively, at 31-40 years to 58 and 59 at &gt;70. The declines in obese patients were similar with corresponding values of 88 ml per min per 1.73 m(2) and 97 ml per min per 13 l at 31-40 and 57 and 59 at &gt;70 years. Linear regression analysis of non-categorized data from age 40 years showed rates of decline slightly slower in the obese (0.82 vs 0.95 ml per min per 1.73 m(2) per year and 0.87 vs 1.02 ml per min per 13 l per year). No effect of obesity on renal function was shown. Scaling to BSA did not distort the results.",M1
19172243,"A copper(II)-selective chelator ameliorates left-ventricular hypertrophy in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomised placebo-controlled study.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Cu(II)-selective chelation with trientine ameliorates cardiovascular and renal disease in a model of diabetes in rats. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Cu(II)-selective chelation might improve left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: We performed a 12 month randomised placebo-controlled study of the effects of treatment with the Cu(II)-selective chelator trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride, 600 mg given orally twice daily) on LVH in diabetic patients (n = 15/group at baseline) in an outpatient setting wherein participants, caregivers and those assessing outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Using MRI, we measured left ventricular variables at baseline, and at months 6 and 12. The change from baseline in left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVM(<e>bsa</e>)) was the primary endpoint variable. RESULTS: Diabetic patients had LVH with preserved ejection fraction at baseline. Trientine treatment decreased LVM(bsa) by 5.0 +/- 7.2 g/m(2) (mean +/- SD) at month 6 (when 14 trientine-treated and 14 placebo-treated participants were analysed; p = 0.0056 compared with placebo) and by 10.6 +/- 7.6 g/m(2) at month 12 (when nine trientine-treated and 13 placebo-treated participants were analysed; p = 0.0088), whereas LVM(bsa) was unchanged by placebo treatment. In a multiple-regression model that explained ~75% of variation (R (2) = 0.748, p = 0.001), cumulative urinary Cu excretion over 12 months was positively associated with trientine-evoked decreases in LVM(bsa). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Cu(II)-selective chelation merits further exploration as a potential pharmacotherapy for diabetic heart disease.

19165504,"Prednisone dosing per body weight or body surface area in children with nephrotic syndrome: is it equivalent?The current guidelines recommend a dosage of prednisone of 60 mg/m(2) body surface area per day (<e>BSA</e> PRED) for the initial therapy of nephrotic syndrome (NS). Alternatively, a dosage of 2 mg/kg body weight per day (W PRED) can be used. We hypothesized that the BSA PRED and W PRED are not equivalent and analyzed the differences between BSA PRED calculated with various formulas for body surface area (BSA), W PRED and the dose of prednisone prescribed for our patients. We performed a retrospective chart review of the patients at their initial presentation of NS. Thirty-three children were included, of median age 3.34 years at presentation. The W PRED was significantly lower than BSA PRED (P &lt; 0.05), with a median W PRED:BSA PRED ratio of 0.85 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.8 to 0.9]. The difference between W PRED and BSA PRED decreased proportionally to patients' weights up to 30 kg. No differences were noted between the various BSA formulas using both weight and height for the calculation of BSA. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a proportional error between W PRED and BSA PRED up to the average daily dose of 60 mg, with a mean bias of 0.86 (95% limits of agreement = 0.68 to 1.05). Ten out of the 33 patients (30%) were given a lower than recommended BSA PRED dose by more than 5 mg/day. In conclusion, the dosage of prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day versus 60 mg/m(2) per day is not equivalent for patients with weights &lt;30 kg and/or dose &lt;60 mg/day.",M1
19150953,"Fixed dosing and pharmacokinetics of S-1 in Japanese cancer patients with large body surface areas.BACKGROUND: S-1 is an oral anticancer agent that combines tegafur (FT) with 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate. The recommended initial dose of S-1 is 120 mg/day for patients with a body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) of &gt; or =1.5 m(2) in Japan. METHODS: We examined the effects of using this fixed dose on the pharmacokinetics of FT, CDHP, and active 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the basis of actual BSA. The pharmacokinetics was compared between patients with a BSA of 1.5-1.75 m(2) and those with a BSA of &gt; or =1.75 m(2). RESULTS: The median areas under the time-concentration curves (AUCs) of 5-FU and CDHP were significantly lower in patients with a BSA of &gt; or =1.75 m(2) than in those with a BSA of 1.5-1.75 m(2) (P = 0.005 and 0.006, respectively; Mann-Whitney U-test).

19100432,"Estimation of standard liver volume for liver transplantation in the Chinese population.INTRODUCTION: The accurate assessment of standard liver volume (SLV) is necessary for the safety of both the donor and the recipient in living donor liver transplantation. However, the accuracy of SLV formulas relates to cohorts or races. This study examined the accuracy of a simple linear formula versus previous formulas of SLV for Chinese adults. METHODS: Among 112 patients with normal liver, we created a new formula for SLV with stepwise regression analysis using the following variables: age, gender, body weight, body height, body mass index, and body surface area. The agreement between the actual liver volume (LV) and calculated LV using various formulas was prospectively evaluated among 63 living donors by paired-sample student's t-test and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: A new formula was developed SLV (mL) = 949.7 x <e>BSA</e> (m(2)) - 48.3 x age - 247.4 where age was counted as 1 for those &lt;40, 2 if 41-60, and 3 if &gt;60 years old. The calculated LV using our formula showed no significant difference from the actual LV using the paired-samples student's t-test (P = .653). Lin's concordance correlation coefficient showed substantial agreement between estimated LV using our formula and actual LV. Furthermore, this study also observed an almost perfect agreement between our formula and the Yoshizumi et al formula. CONCLUSION: Our formula, which accurately estimated LV among Chinese adults, may be applicable to adults of other ethnicitis.",M1
19067925,"The effect of donor/recipient body surface area ratio on outcomes in pediatric kidney transplantation.In pediatric kidney transplantation, the effect of inadequate nephron dosing on graft survival remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to assess the use of D/R <e>BSA</e>, as a reliable indicator of adequate nephron dosing, and eventually a tool to optimize pediatric graft allocation. Following Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed deceased donor pediatric kidney transplantation (N = 156). We divided patients into three groups, based on D/R BSA: A &lt; or =0.8; B 0.81-1.19; C &gt; or =1.2. Five-yr graft survival rates in the groups were: A 82.0%; B 94.9%; C 97.1% (p = 0.01). Group C had the lowest rate of acute rejection, suggesting a protective effect of increased D/R BSA (group A = 35.7%, group B = 38.9%, group C = 18.8%; p = 0.029). The logistic regression analysis showed that decreased D/R BSA ratio is a risk factor for loss of graft function, at one and five yr [i.e., group A OR 6 (95% CI 1.14-39.30, p = 0.015) and OR 4.49 (95% CI 1.46-13.79, p = 0.009), respectively]. We conclude that for pediatric recipients, D/R BSA is a valuable adjunct when determining long-term graft survival. Its utility may avoid an alloimmune-independent risk factor, increasing the long-term protective value of a good matching policy.",M1
19064986,"Soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence: the prognostic role of tumor size in relation to patient body size.PURPOSE: Tumor size is a key prognostic variable for soft tissue sarcomas (STS), and a tumor diameter of 5 cm is generally used as a cutoff for risk grouping purposes. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic effect of tumor size on overall survival and whether such an effect was influenced by the patient's size, expressed as body-surface area (<e>BSA</e>), in a series of 553 pediatric patients with localized STS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multivariable Cox models were used in which the effect of tumor size was adjusted for patients age, tumor site, histologic subtype, and Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study grouping, and the interaction between size and BSA was included. RESULTS: Tumor size was confirmed as a significant prognostic factor. Interaction between size and BSA meant that, for a given tumor size, the mortality increased from the larger to the smaller BSA. Conversely, the mortality risk associated with a patient with a BSA of 1.75 m(2) and a 5-cm tumor was the same as for a 0.6 m(2) child with a 2.8-cm tumor. CONCLUSION: Tumor and body size are jointly informative on outcome. The risk associated with a given tumor size is not the same in patients of different body size, so it may be wrong to use the same 5-cm cutoff for tumor size in risk stratification.",M1
19061495,"Normal values for aortic diameters in children and adolescents--assessment in vivo by contrast-enhanced CMR-angiography.BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced CMR angiography (CE-CMRA) is being increasingly used for diagnosing aortic arch anomalies, planning interventions and follow-up assessment. We sought to establish normal values for the diameters of the thoracic aorta and reference curves related to body growth in children using CE-CMRA. RESULTS: CE-CMRA was performed in 53 children without cardiovascular disease. The median age was 9 years (range 2 - 20 years), weight 30 kg (range 12 - 75 kg), height 131 cm (range 81 - 184 cm), body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) 1.05 m2 (range 0.52-1.9 m2). Aortic diameters were measured at nine standardized sites on oblique maximum-intensity projection (MIP) images. Regression analysis of diameters in relation to BSA demonstrated linear relationship between the cross-sectional aortic diameters and the square root of BSA (BSA0.5). Normative diameters were (0.57 + 19.37*BSA0.5) mm for the aortic sinus, (-3.52 + 18.66*BSA0.5) mm for the first segment of the aortic arch, (-3.37 + 16.52*BSA0.5) mm for the isthmic region and (-1.27 + 9.89*BSA0.5) mm for the descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm. Normative curves are presented. CONCLUSION: This study provides normative values for aortic diameters in children measured by CE-CMRA. These data may serve for making the diagnosis of pediatric arch anomalies, assessing the need for treatment and planning interventions.",M1
19048437,"Reassessment of a classical single injection 51Cr-EDTA clearance method for determination of renal function in children and adults. Part I: Analytically correct relationship between total and one-pool clearance.BACKGROUND: Total plasma clearance of (51)Cr-EDTA, Cl, is widely used as a measure of GFR. Commonly, only the final part of the plasma concentration curve is measured, and a one-pool clearance (slope-intercept clearance), Cl(1), is computed. Empirically determined second-order polynomials of the general form Cl = b x Cl(1) + c x Cl(1)(2) are usually used to estimate Cl from a measured Cl(1). However, theoretical considerations indicate that such corrections underestimate Cl at high values. AIMS: To derive an analytically correct relationship between Cl and Cl(1) and determine the parameters involved for children and adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cl was determined in 149 subjects (M/F/children: 71/46/32) from a complete plasma concentration curve followed for 4-5 h after injection of (51)Cr-EDTA (range of clearance: 8-183 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Plasma volume, PV and the  missing  area under the plasma fraction curve, a (minutes), not used for determination of Cl(1), were measured. RESULTS: The true relationship between Cl and Cl(1) is given by Cl = Cl(1)/(1 + f x Cl(1)), where f = a/PV. For men, women and children alike, the equation f = 0.0032 x <e>BSA</e>(-1.3) was applicable (BSA = body surface area in m(2)). Estimation errors on clearance were within +/-8% for adults and +/-13% for children (95% limits of agreement). CONCLUSIONS: The true relationship between Cl and Cl(1) of (51)Cr-EDTA is given, resulting in a common correction equation applicable for children and adults. The new equation has better mathematical behaviour than quadratic equations on very high values of clearance and takes into account dependence on body size.",M1
19016765,"CBR1 and CBR3 pharmacogenetics and their influence on doxorubicin disposition in Asian breast cancer patients.The present study aimed to identify polymorphic genes encoding carbonyl reductases (CBR1, CBR3) and investigate their influence on doxorubicin disposition in Asian breast cancer patients (n = 62). Doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) was administered every 3 weeks for four to six cycles and the pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis (WinNonlin). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess genotypic-phenotypic correlations. Five CBR1 (-48G&gt;A, c.219G&gt;C, c.627C&gt;T, c.693G&gt;A, +967G&gt;A) and CBR3 (c.11G&gt;A, c.255C&gt;T, c.279C&gt;T, c.606G&gt;A, c.730G&gt;A) polymorphisms were identified. The CBR1 D2 diplotypes were characterized by the presence of at least one variant allele at the c.627C&gt;T and +967G&gt;A loci. Patients in the CBR1 D1 diplotype group had significantly higher clearance (CL) normalized to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) (CL/BSA[L/h/m(2)]: median 25.09; range 16.44-55.66) and significantly lower exposure levels; area under curve (AUC(0-infinity)/dose/BSA [h/m(5)]; median 15.08; range 6.18-38.03) of doxorubicin compared with patients belonging to the CBR1 D2 diplotype group (CL/BSA[L/h/m(2)]; median 20.88; range 8.68-31.79, P = 0.014; and AUC(0-infinity)/dose/BSA[h/m(5)]; median 21.35; range 9.82-67.17, P = 0.007 respectively). No significant influence of CBR3 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin were observed in Asian cancer patients. The present exploratory study shows that CBR1 D2 diplotypes correlate with significantly higher exposure levels of doxorubicin, suggesting the possibility of lowered intracellular conversion to doxorubicinol in these patients. Further evaluation of carbonyl reductase polymorphisms in influencing the treatment efficacy of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in Asian cancer patients are warranted.",M1
18997455,"Sex difference in the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in dialysis patients.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important, independent negative predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Previous studies suggest a sex dimorphism in the prevalence of LVH; however, this issue has never been approached in dialysis patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 237 prevalent dialysis patients: 49 on hemodialysis (HD) and 188 on peritoneal dialysis (PD) from a single center. LVH was defined by echocardiography measurements, which were normalized to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and height(2.7), respectively. RESULTS: The mean ages in HD and PD patients were 60 +/- 14 and 60 +/- 13 years, with a median dialysis vintage of 43 and 20 months, respectively. Although there was no significant difference in age, diabetes, proportion of uncontrolled hypertension, antihypertensive medication and blood pressure between male and female patients within each dialysis modality, the prevalence of LVH (whether indexed to BSA or height(2.7)) was consistently higher in females than in males. When these patients were divided into LVH or non-LVH groups, a significant difference in sex distribution was observed between the two groups (62.0% vs. 41.0% when the BSA-indexed standard was used, p &lt; 0.01; 62.8% vs. 37.1% when the height(2.7)-indexed standard was used, p &lt; 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, female sex was identified as a risk factor of LVH (odds ratio, OR = 2.48, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.33-4.59; when BSA-indexed LVH was treated as dependent variable, and OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.96-8.38, when height(2.7)-indexed LVH was treated as dependent variable) even after adjustment for age, diabetes, blood pressure and antihypertensive medication. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the prevalence of LVH determined by echocardiography was significantly higher in female dialysis patients than in male dialysis patients. Compared with males, female patients had a 2.5- to 4-fold higher risk to develop LVH even after adjustment for other potential confounding factors, which may indicate that elderly females in the uremic scenario are more prone to develop LVH than elderly males.",M1
18986347,"A comparison between <e>BSA</e>, PASI, PLASI and SAPASI as measures of disease severity and improvement by therapy in patients with psoriasis.BACKGROUND: This study investigates four measures of disease severity in patients with psoriasis, both before and after therapy. METHODS: Data records were analyzed from 33 patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were treated with efalizumab, 1 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, for 12 weeks. Four measures of disease severity were used: body surface area (BSA), psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), psoriasis log-based area and severity index (PLASI) and self-administered PASI (SAPASI). RESULTS: At the end of the 12-week therapy, the mean percent improvement shown by each measure varied considerably, ranging from 48.6% (PASI) to 70.6% (SAPASI). PASI and PLASI were the most comparable (67.3% and 66.5%). These differences were smaller when a dermatologist's opinion about the improvement was taken into account, for example  very good improvement  ranged from mean percent improvement of 63.8% (BSA) to 83.8% (PASI). The correlation between all measures revealed a high level of significance (P&lt;or= 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines revealed PLASI as the most reliable measure for the severity and therapeutic improvement in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. PLASI proved to be a marginally more accurate than PASI, and much more accurate than SAPASI and BSA. The superiority of PLASI may be a result of the logarithmic scale of the affected skin surface.",M1
18986007,"Enrollment fluid status is independently associated with long-term survival of peritoneal dialysis patients.Fluid overload is a common complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The prognostic importance of enrollment fluid status in long-term PD patients remains to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prognostic importance of enrollment fluid status in the long-term survival of PD patients. We enrolled 53 PD patients (mean age: 53 years) from November 2000 to February 2006. On enrollment, demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were recorded. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was used to determine the fluid status of PD patients, including extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), and total body water (TBW). Fluid status was corrected for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>): ECW-BSA, ICW-BSA, and TBW-BSA respectively. Patients were followed to January 2008. The ECW-BSA correlated negatively with albumin, a marker of nutrition (r = -0.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The ICW/ECW ratio (r = 0.36, p = 0.018) correlated directly and the ECW/ TBW ratio (r = -0.36, p = 0.019) correlated negatively with creatinine. Patients who survived during the study period had a significantly lower ECW-BSA (8.29 L/m2 vs. 9.91 L/m2, p = 0.001) than did those who did not survive. Patients with enrollment ECW-BSA below 9 L/m2 had a significantly better 7-year cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) than did patients with a ECW-BSA of 9 L/m2 or more (p = 0.019). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, race, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and months on dialysis at enrollment, ECW-BSA was a significant independent predictor of mortality (relative risk: 1.50; p = 0.03). In conclusion, ECW-BSA was a significant independent predictor of long-term survival in PD patients.",M1
18952236,"Body surface area prediction in normal, hypermuscular, and obese mice.BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) in experimental animals is essential for modeling effects of burn injury or drug metabolism. Two-dimensional surface area is related to three-dimensional body volume, which in turn can be estimated from body mass. The Meeh equation relates body surface area to the two-thirds power of body mass, through a constant, k, which must be determined empirically by species and size. We found older values of k overestimated BSA in certain mice; thus we determined empirically k for various strains of normal, obese, and hypermuscular mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BSA was computed from digitally scanned pelts and nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine the best-fit k. RESULTS: The empirically determined k for C57BL/6J mice of 9.82 was not significantly different from other inbred and outbred mouse strains of normal body composition. However, mean k of the nearly spheroid, obese lepr(db/db) mice (k = 8.29) was significantly lower than for normals, as were values for dumbbell-shaped, hypermuscular mice with either targeted deletion of the myostatin gene (Mstn) (k = 8.48) or with skeletal muscle specific expression of a dominant negative myostatin receptor (Acvr2b) (k = 8.80). CONCLUSIONS: Hypermuscular and obese mice differ substantially from normals in shape and density, resulting in considerably altered k values. This suggests Meeh constants should be determined empirically for animals of altered body composition. Use of these new, improved Meeh constants will allow greater accuracy in experimental models of burn injury and pharmacokinetics.",M1
18948670,"Morphometric analysis of aortic coarctation: determination of the target vessel diameter required to relieve the pressure gradient.BACKGROUND: Little is known about the precise morphometric data of the aortic arch at which the transcatheter pressure gradient is relieved in patients with aortic coarctation (CoA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine morphometric data were obtained from patients with CoA including the body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) adjusted angiographic diameter of the narrowest vessel, the ratio of the angiographic diameter to that of the descending aorta and BSA-adjusted narrowest cross-sectional area (CSA) using intravascular ultrasound imaging. The transcatheter peak-to-peak pressure gradient of the aortic arch was measured using a manometer tipped catheter. A linear regression analysis showed CSA to have the strongest correlation with the pressure gradient (r=0.92, p=0.0002) among any pressure gradient group (n=10). A receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the morphometric cut-off point at which the pressure gradient occurs. CSA had the highest areas under the ROC (1.0) and the cut-off point of 81 mm2/m2 showed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% to predict the relief of a pressure gradient. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CoA, the vessel size that can relieve a pressure gradient is a CSA of 81 mm2/m2 (10 x BSA0.5 mm in diameter). This data may provide useful information for catheter intervention and surgery.",M1
18922643,"Dosing chemotherapy in obese patients: actual versus assigned body surface area (<e>BSA</e>).Obesity is a chronic disease that has increased dramatically in the past few decades worldwide. More concerning, obesity is linked to many other disease states including cancer and has been shown to increase mortality. Unfortunately, oncology drug development and most clinical trials fail to address the problem of appropriate chemotherapy dosing in obese patients. This can potentially lead to either increased toxicity or decreased efficacy. Although dosing schemas may vary among practices and institutions, many oncologists tend to remain conservative and empirically dose-reduce obese patients despite data suggesting otherwise. The goals of this review were to consider the various aspects of pharmacokinetics in obese patients, to examine the existing literature regarding chemotherapy dosing in obese patients, and to determine the most appropriate weight estimation for body surface area (BSA) dose calculations. Based upon the current clinical data of obesity and chemotherapy dosing it can be concluded there is very limited if any data to support the perception that capping the doses of obese patients is beneficial and more likely this practice may have negative implications on survival outcomes. Under dosing patients with treatable or even curable disease to prevent toxicities could be costing the obese oncology patient population months to years of overall survival.",M1
18798700,"Dose calculation of anticancer drugs.BACKGROUND: Anticancer drugs are characterized by a narrow therapeutic window and significant inter-patient variability in therapeutic and toxic effects. Current body surface area (<e>BSA</e>)-based dosing fails to standardize systemic anticancer drug exposure and other alternative dosing strategies also have their limitations. Just as important as the initial dose selection is the subsequent dose revision to ensure the dose is correct. OBJECTIVE: To provide an insight into the different dose individualization and dose adjustment methods, their feasibility and applicability in daily oncology practice and to suggest a practical framework for dose calculation and a basis for future research. METHODS: Review of relevant literature related to dose calculation of anticancer drugs. RESULTS: Strategies using clinical parameters, genotype and phenotype markers, and therapeutic drug monitoring all have potential and each has a role for specific drugs. However, no one method is a practical dose calculation strategy for many or all drugs. CONCLUSION: Given that BSA-dosing leads to significant underdosing it is not reasonable to use this as the sole method of dose calculation. Because of wide disparity in individual patient characteristics and elimination mechanisms, we are unlikely to find the 'Holy Grail' of a single individualized dosing strategy for every patient and anticancer drug in the near future. We propose a pragmatic, although invalidated system for initial dose calculation using dose clusters and structured subsequent dose revision based on treatment-related toxicities and therapeutic drug monitoring. These models need to be tested in clinical trials.",M1
18790222,"The correlation of renal allograft weight to metabolic index ratios and glomerular filtration rate among living-unrelated kidney transplant patients: a cross-sectional study.OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether there was a relationship between the ratios of renal allograft weight (RAW) and metabolic indices: specifically, recipient body weight (RBW), recipient body mass index (RBMI), and recipient body surface area (RBSA), and posttransplant renal function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It also sought to determine which of the 3 ratios, and the minimum ratio, that was predictive of a good GFR as well as to ascertain which computational formula (Cockroft-Gault [C&amp;G] vs abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [aMDRD]) better predicts renal function. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed among living unrelated kidney transplant patients who did not manifest rejection, ischemic injury, or postoperative morbidity and mortality from January to December 2006. Donor/recipient matching was based on conventional immunologic parameters. The harvested kidney was weighed after a cold bath and then transplanted by a single surgical team. The 3 ratios, RAW/RBW, RAW/RBMI, and RAW/RBMI were correlated with GFR, which was computed using C&amp;G and aMDRD formulae based on serum creatinine at discharge and at 6 months follow-up. Statistical analysis used STATA 7 and the Pearson correlation using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The 53 kidney transplant patients has a mean age of 39.8 years +/- 19 SD (range, 6-74), and slight male predominance (58% vs 42%). RAW/RBW was most positively correlated with GFR estimated by aMDRD (r = .89; P &lt; .001) but negatively correlated with GFR estimated by the C&amp;G formula both at discharge and at 6 months follow-up. A similar trend was observed with RAW/RBMI (r = .79; P &lt; .001), whereas RAW/<e>BSA</e> was related to neither GFR formula. Of the 3 ratios, RAW/RBW best predicted GFR using the aMDRD formula. The minimum RAW/RBW ratio that predicted good GFR (&gt;90 mL/min) at 6 month follow-up was 8.2 (accuracy 88.6%; P = .004). CONCLUSION: The RAW/RBW and RAW/RBMI correlated with GFR measures by the aMDRD method. Of the 3 ratios, only RAW/RBW was useful to predict GFR, best estimated by the aMDRD formula. A minimum RAW/RBW ratio of 8.2 predicted a good GFR at 6 months posttransplant. The findings suggested that transplanting a small kidney into a heavy patient may be a risk factor for allograft failure and that having a high initial ratio (&gt; or =8.2) of renal allograft weight to initial recipient body weight was an advantage.",M1
18702909,"Acoustic rhinometry in children: some practical aspects and influence of age and body surface area on results.BACKGROUND: Since acoustic rhinometry was described there has been a lack of normal values for minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), especially for children. There has also been debate about factors influencing normal values. The purpose of this study was to find the normal values for children in a Finnish population and whether there is any correlation between age or body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and MCA. METHODS: We measured 74 children (age, 1-12 years) with an acoustic rhinometer. The values of MCA were compared with age and BSA determined from height and weight. RESULTS: The mean of unilateral MCA was 0.225 cm2 (SD, 0.041). We found positive correlation between unilateral volume on the left side and age and between MCA from the right side and age or BSA as a constant predictor. As much as 28.4% of the measurements had to be rejected because of acoustic leakage between nostril and nosepiece. Only 6.8% had to be rejected because of a lack of cooperation. CONCLUSION: It is possible to find normal values for children. Acoustic rhinometry is well tolerated among children. The method is rapid, reliable and noninvasive, and minimal cooperation is required. The measurements must be performed in a standard way, and some important causes of errors must be kept in mind.",M1
18691174,"Variance inflation in sequential calculations of body surface area, plasma volume, and prostate-specific antigen mass.OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of variability among 11 formulae for human body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and then among eight for plasma volume (PV), as used to represent physiological indices for body metabolism, drug dosages and body fluid management, and to evaluate the potential cumulative effect of variance inflation with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mass as an endpoint. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 3020 men undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy (RRP) at the Vattikuti Urology Institute between 2001 and 2008, the variation in BSA and PV formulae was calculated, as well as PSA mass, using analysis of variance (anova), Bland-Altman plots, linear regression, and correlation analyses. RESULTS: For estimating BSA, anova indicated significant variance among the 11 formulae used (P &lt; 0.001) with a between-groups variance of 5.45. Bland-Altman plots reported bias when the Dubois formula was compared to other BSA formulae. Furthermore the anova for PV, with BSA as a predictor, indicated significant variance among the eight formulae used (P &lt; 0.001), with a mean between-group variance of 444.4 and a mean inflation factor of 81.5. Scatter plots between one PV formula (Boer) and others had a good linear fit. For PSA mass, anova indicated significant variance (P &lt; 0.001) using PV as a predictor, with a mean between-group variance of 16 799.6 and a mean variance inflation factor of 37.8. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variation in the BSA calculated by commonly used formulae. This variation is carried over and further magnified in the sequential calculation of PV and PSA mass. Hence arbitrary selection of BSA and PV formulae is likely to affect inferences.",M1
18687545,"Magnetic-resonance-imaging-derived indices for the normalization of left ventricular morphology by body size.Scaling left ventricular (LV) mass and other cardiac dimensions to account for individual body size is important. The traditional method of simple ratio scaling using, for example, body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) assumes a linear and proportional relationship and accurate measurement of both LV mass and BSA. These assumptions can be questioned; hence, we examined the appropriateness of methods and different indices using highly accurate magnetic resonance imaging scans. Cardiac and whole-body scans were performed in 172 young, healthy, male subjects (age range, 17-28 years) to assess LV mass, volume, linear dimensions, lean body mass and fat mass. Height, body mass and BSA were determined anthropometrically. Relationships were examined for linearity and closeness of fit using log-log least-squares linear regression to determine the slope exponent b (where 1.0 indicates linearity). The relationship between LV mass and lean body mass (b=.90+/-.15; r(2)=.66) was linear and geometrically consistent. This was also the case for LV end-diastolic volume (b=.70), although the confidence intervals were broader (+/-0.32) and the r(2) (.31) smaller. The relationships between LV mass, volume and other variables were generally not linear or geometrically consistent. LV linear dimensions did not demonstrate any linear relationships, and in particular, those with BSA were extremely poor (r(2)=.02-.09). In summary, the traditional scaling of LV measurements to BSA does not remove the influence of body size and other techniques should be considered. Lean body mass was the most appropriate variable for simple indexing of LV mass. No body size variable had a linear and proportional relationship with LV linear dimensions, and the use of simple ratio scaling for these is seriously questioned.",M1
18650405,"Feasibility and impact of the measurement of extracellular fluid volume simultaneous with GFR by 125I-iothalamate.The feasibility, validity, and possible applications of the assessment of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) simultaneous with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were assessed in a series of validation studies using the constant infusion method of (125)I-iothalamate (IOT). In 48 subjects with a broad range of GFR, distribution volume (V(d)) of IOT corresponded well with V(d) bromide (16.71 +/- 3.0 and 16.73 +/- 3.2 l, respectively, not significant), with a strong correlation (r = 0.933, P &lt; 0.01) and without systematic deviations. Reproducibility assessment in 25 healthy male subjects showed coefficients of variation of 8.6% of duplicate measurement of V(d) IOT during strictly standardized (50 mmol Na(+)/d) sodium intake. An increase in dietary sodium intake (200 mmol Na(+)/d) induced a corresponding rise in V(d) IOT of 1.11 +/- 1.5 l (P &lt; 0.01). In 158 healthy prospective kidney donors, the impact of indexing of GFR to ECFV was analyzed. Age, gender, height, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) were determinants of GFR. Whereas GFR, GFR/BSA, and GFR/height were gender-dependent, GFR/ECFV was gender-independent and not related to height or BSA. This supports the potential of normalizing GFR by ECFV. Thus, ECFV can be simultaneously assessed with GFR by the constant infusion method using IOT. After appropriate validation, also other GFR tracers could be used for such a simultaneous estimation, providing a valuable resource of data on ECFV in renal studies and, moreover, allowing GFR to be indexed to the body fluid compartment it clears: the ECFV.",M1
18622423,"Determination of initial i.v. CYA dosage to achieve target AUC values in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.In solid organ transplantation, CYA dosing is based on the area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC(inf)). This study aimed to develop a guideline for the initial i.v. CYA dose for pediatric hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) patients to achieve the target AUC(inf) recommended in solid organ transplantation. Whole-blood CYA concentrations were determined in 24 patients (0.5-16.9 years) after the first i.v. dose given over 2 h, 1 day before HSCT. The i.v. CYA dose predicted to achieve an AUC(inf) of 4200 microg x h/l was calculated for each patient and expressed as a function of each patient's actual weight and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). In patients &lt;or=9 and &gt;9 years of age, the mean i.v. CYA dose predicted to achieve the target AUC was 2.6+/-0.94 and 2.1+/-1.21 mg/kg, respectively. When these doses were expressed in terms of BSA, the mean dose was 65+/-23.1 and 68+/-35.0 mg/m(2) in children &lt;or=9 and &gt;9 years of age, respectively. In children 0.5-17 years of age undergoing HSCT, we recommend an initial i.v. CYA dose of 65 mg/m(2) infused over 2 h to achieve an AUC(inf) of approximately 4200 microg x h/l.",M1
18609287,"Suitability of a simplified technique based on iohexol for decentralized measurement of glomerular filtration rate.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess a simplified method for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using iohexol that could form the basis of a decentralized service for measuring GFR by sample transportation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-fasting GFR was measured with Cr-51-EDTA and iohexol injected simultaneously into opposite arms (n = 110). Cubital venous blood samples, obtained bilaterally 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after injection, were assayed for marker injected contralaterally, Cr-51-EDTA by well-counting and iohexol by X-ray fluorescence. Following biexponential analysis of the clearance curves, GFR was measured from all six samples and also from the last three samples and scaled to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). GFR scaled to extracellular fluid volume (GFR/ECV) was calculated from six samples as the mean transit time of marker through its distribution volume and from three samples as the clearance half-time. RESULTS: Cr-51-EDTA correlated closely with iohexol for measuring GFR/BSA (r = 0.97 for three samples, 0.94 for six). The two markers agreed more closely with each other in the measurement of GFR/BSA compared with GFR/ECV. GFR/BSA values showed better agreement with corresponding GFR/ECV values when they were measured with Cr-51-EDTA compared with iohexol. Six samples offered no significant advantage compared with three. CONCLUSIONS: Iohexol is less accurate than Cr-51-EDTA and scaling to BSA is more robust than scaling to ECV. Nevertheless, iohexol has potential to measure GFR by sample transportation, without having to measure injected dose. This would allow accurate measurement of GFR in a primary care setting.",M1
18593998,"Effect of food on the pharmacokinetic behavior of the potent oral taxane BMS-275183.PURPOSE: BMS-275183 is a potent oral paclitaxel analogue that previously showed promising activity. The goal of the present trial was to investigate whether food affects the pharmacokinetics of BMS-275183. Additionally, we evaluated its pharmacokinetic variability using flat-fixed dosing compared with dosing individualized by body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). Patients and Methods: The patients were treated with 200 mg of BMS-275183 under fasting condition (A), after a standard low-fat meal (B), or after a high-fat meal (C). The patients were randomized to one of six treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA). The fourth (D) and consecutive weekly doses were normalized by BSA and consisted of 200 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetic sampling was done up to 72 hours after the first four doses and analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were treated. Pharmacokinetic data were available for 26 patients (A and C), 24 patients (B), and 21 patients (D). Compared with administration under fasted conditions, a decrease of 39% and 63% in the maximal observed drug concentration was observed when BMS-275183 was administered after a low-fat and a high-fat meal, respectively. There was no change in systemic exposure as measured by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(inf)). No apparent relationship was observed between AUC(inf) and BSA for either the 200 mg or the 200 mg/m(2) regimen. BMS-275183 was well tolerated with grade 3 and 4 toxicity in eight patients. One partial response was observed in a non-small cell lung cancer patient. CONCLUSIONS: Food intake does not affect the pharmacologic exposure to BMS-275183. BMS-275183 can be given orally by flat dosing instead of BSA-normalized dosing.",M1
18589128,"Estimation of standard liver volume for Japanese adults.INTRODUCTION: Accurate pretransplant estimation of the recipient's standard liver volume (SLV) is important. The purpose of this study was to compare reported formulas for clinical estimation of liver volume among Japanese adults. METHODS: We reviewed data on 70 healthy adults (46 men, 24 women, ages 20 to 65 years old) evaluated for living donor liver transplantation. Liver volume (LV) was measured using two- or three-dimensional computed tomography volumetry (CTV). The formulas of DeLand (LV = 1020 x body surface area [<e>BSA</e>] - 220), Urata (LV = 706.2 x BSA + 2.4), Noda (LV = 50.12 x BW(0.78)), Heinemann (LV = 1072.8 x BSA - 345.7), Vauthey (LV = 18.51 x BW + 191.8) and Yoshizumi (LV = 772 x BSA) were applied to estimate LV. We calculated the differences for individual donors betwen CTV and LV estimated by each formula. RESULTS: Mean LVs as estimated by the formulae of DeLand and Heinemann et al were significantly greater (P &lt; .01) than the mean CTV, while LV estimated by the formula of Urata was significantly less (P &lt; .05) than the CTV. The formulas of DeLand and Heinemann overestimated LV, while the formula of Urata underestimated it. The formulae of Noda et al and Yoshizumi et al tended to underestimate the LV when the CTV was greater than 1600 cm(3). When the Yoshizumi formula was applied, the number of donors with an acceptable difference (+/-15%) between CTV and estimated LV was 55 (78.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The Yoshizumi formula was applicable, especially for patients with a BSA &lt; 2.0, whereas the well-known Urata formula made LV underestimates.",M1
18553279,"CT assessment of main pulmonary artery diameter.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the normal range of the main pulmonary artery diameter (MPAD) by computed tomography (CT) in persons with normal pulmonary artery pressure, and then to evaluate the relationship of the diameter with age, gender, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2005 and June 2007, among patients who had previously undergone a contrast-enhanced thorax CT scan, 112 persons (47 females, 65 males) without pulmonary pathology were selected for the study. All patients had normal mean pulmonary artery pressure. The widest diameter perpendicular to the long axis of the main pulmonary artery was measured at the pulmonary artery bifurcation level. The outer limits of the contrast were used to determine vessel diameter. RESULTS: Pulmonary artery diameters showed a homogeneous distribution; the CT-determined mean pulmonary artery diameter was 26.6 +/- 2.9 mm. The mean MPAD in males was 27 +/- 2.8 mm, and 25.9 +/- 3.0 mm in females. This difference was considered to be statistically significant (P = 0.048). There was a significant relationship between the MAPD and age and BSA (P = 0.043, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that in individuals with normal pulmonary artery pressure, the upper limit of the MPAD is 32.6 mm and that MPAD is wellcorrelated with BSA.",M1

18515131,"Prophylactic aortic root surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome: 10 years' experience with a protocol based on body surface area.BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommending prophylactic aortic root replacement in Marfan syndrome are based on absolute diameters of the aortic root. However, aortic root diameter is a function of body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). Here, we report our experience with a protocol for prophylactic aortic root replacement based on BSA. METHODS: Patients with established Marfan syndrome (Ghent criteria) and without prior aortic surgery were eligible for our study. Aortic root ratio was defined as the ratio between the observed aortic root diameter (as measured during annual echocardiography) and the maximum predicted aortic root diameter as calculated according to age and BSA. Replacement surgery was performed if dilatation of the aortic root during follow-up resulted in an aortic root ratio &gt;/=1.3. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients fulfilled the entry criteria (24 men/29 women, median age at baseline 27 years, range 18-59 years). During follow-up between 1997 and 2007 (mean 4.7+/-3.2 years) four patients underwent uncomplicated aortic root replacement; two had an aortic root ratio &gt;/=1.3 (aortic root diameters were 4.9 and 5.2 cm, respectively), one had aortic root dilatation of 0.4 cm/year and a positive family history for aortic dissection and one had an aneurysm of the ascending aorta as the primary indication. None of the patients in the whole group suffered from type A aortic dissection and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although numbers are small, our protocol for prophylactic aortic root replacement in patients with Marfan syndrome based on BSA was effective in terms of preventing aortic dissection and mortality.",M1
18513527,"Prognostic value of preoperative indexed end-systolic left ventricle diameter in the outcome after surgery in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation.BACKGROUND: End-systolic diameter (ESD) is an important parameter in the prognosis and indication for surgery in chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). It has been suggested that ESD values noncorrected for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) could be inappropriate in the management of patients with extreme BSA. The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of indexed ESD (IESD) of the left ventricle in the management of patients with severe isolated chronic AR. METHODS: One hundred forty-seven patients underwent surgery for chronic AR and were followed up for a mean of 8 +/- 6 years (1-22 years). A post hoc assessment was made of the prognostic value of preoperative ESD and IESD in different BSA percentiles: group 1, &lt;or= 25th percentile (BSA 1.43-1.68 m(2), n = 40); group 2, &gt;25th percentile and &lt;or=75th percentile (BSA 1.69-1.91 m(2), n = 68); and group 3, &gt;75th percentile (BSA 1.92-2.24 m(2), n = 39). RESULTS: Age-adjusted preoperative ESD and IESD were independent predictors of mortality or heart failure in the entire population. Magnitude of the relative risk was slightly greater using preoperative IESD than ESD (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.29, P = .017; HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P = .016). In group 1, the age-adjusted expected mortality rate would drop if IESD of 25 mm/m(2) was used as a surgical criterion instead of ESD 50 mm, from 37.94% to 24.27% at 10 years (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IESD improves the prediction of unfavorable outcomes after surgery in patients with low BSA but not in those with high BSA. In patients with low BSA, IESD &gt;or=25 mm/m(2) should be used as a cutoff point for surgery rather than ESD &gt;50 mm.",M1
18512492,"Aortic valve replacement: is there an implant size variation across Europe?BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Prompted by anecdotal evidence and observations by surgeons, an investigation was undertaken into the potential differences in implanted aortic valve prosthesis sizes, during aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures, between northern and southern European countries. METHODS: A multi-institutional, non-randomized, retrospective analysis was conducted among 2,932 patients who underwent AVR surgery at seven tertiary cardiac surgery centers throughout Europe. Demographic and perioperative variables including valve size and type, body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and early mortality were collected. Group analysis by patient geographic distribution and by annular diameter of the prosthesis utilized was conducted. Patients with a manufacturer's labeled prosthesis size &gt; or = 21 mm were assigned to the 'large' aortic size subset, while those with a prosthesis size &lt; 21 mm were assigned to the 'small' aortic size subset. Effective orifice area indices were calculated for all patients to assess the geographic distribution of patient-prosthesis mismatch. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for possible confounding variables were performed. RESULTS: Prostheses with diameter &lt; 21 mm were implanted at almost twice the rate in southern Europe compared to the north (56.4% versus 26.7%, p &lt; 0.01). The mean valve size was also smaller in southern compared to northern European patients (21.6 +/- 2.1 mm versus 23.4 +/- 2.2 mm, p &lt; 0.01). There were no regional differences in the distribution of either gender or BSA. In the multivariable model, south European patients were seven times more likely to receive a smaller-sized aortic valve (OR = 6.5, 95% CI = 4.82-8.83, p &lt; 0.01), and thus the odds of developing patient-prosthesis mismatch were increased two-fold in southern European patients (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.25-2.80, p = 0.02). However, neither geographic distribution nor valve size were significantly associated with operative mortality. CONCLUSION: The study results demonstrated differences in implanted aortic valve size, between the participating northern and southern European countries. Imbalances in the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, health resource availability and variations in surgical practice throughout Europe might be possible etiological causes.",M1
18509325,"Kt/V underestimates the hemodialysis dose in women and small men.Current guidelines suggest a minimum Kt/V of 1.2 for three weekly hemodialysis sessions; however, using V as a normalizing factor has been questioned. Parameters such as weight(0.67) (W(0.67)) and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) that reflect the metabolic rate may be preferable. To determine this, we studied 328 hemodialysis patients (221 male) with a target Kt/V of 1.2. Using this relationship and the individual's Watson Volume, we calculated the Kt, Kt/BSA, and Kt/W(0.67) equivalent to the target and measured the effects of body size and gender on these parameters for each patient. The target corresponded to a range of equivalent Kt/BSA and Kt/W(0.67) each significantly higher in males than females and in larger than smaller males. V/BSA and V/W(0.67), the conversion factors of Kt/V to Kt/BSA and Kt/W(0.67) respectively, were significantly greater in males than females and heavier than lighter men. Our study shows that if Kt/BSA and Kt/W(0.67) reflect the true required dose, prescribing a target Kt/V of 1.2 would underestimate this in females and in small males. Further work is required to develop clinical outcome-based adequacy targets.",M1
18494217,"Comparison of BMI and the body mass/body surface ratio: is BMI a biased tool?For decades we are used to judge our body composition by using the body mass index (BMI). Since the BMI denominator can be considered as a substitute for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), the body mass/body surface ratio (BM/BSA) can be calculated. For a distribution of BM/BSA values comparable to the distribution of normal BMI values, the range 35.5-39.9 kg/m2 is chosen as normal, although it covers BM range 50 to 90 kg. The proposed normal BM/BSA range suggests that heavy adults with less than 2 m of height are not obese only if they are less than 90 kg. If the described limitations of the BM/BSA ratio are valid, then the BMI should be regarded as a biased tool, less applicable to individuals with body masses outside the 55 to 90 kg BM range. If we consider many health problems related to the increased body mass, it is possible that the BMI should be used with caution in heavy individuals.",M1
18490317,"Derivation of a size-independent variable for scaling of cardiac dimensions in a normal paediatric population.AIMS: It is general practice to correct cardiac chamber size for body size by the process of scaling or normalization. Normalization is most commonly performed using simple linear or isometric correction; however, there is increasing evidence that this approach may be flawed. Likewise, there is little agreement concerning the appropriate scaling variable (measure of body size) for normalization. Therefore, we aimed to establish the optimal method for correcting the differences in body size in a large population of echocardiographically normal paediatric subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the relative ability of standard size variables including height (HT), body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), in both isometric and allometric models, to remove the effect of body size in 4109 consecutive echocardiographically normal subjects&lt;18 years of age, using the left atrial dimension (LAD) as a reference standard. Simple linear normalization resulted in significant residual correlations (r=-0.57 to -0.92) of the indexed value with the body size variable, the correlations with weight (WT) and BSA actually increasing. In contrast, correction by the optimal allometric exponent (AE) removed the effects of the indexed variable (residual correlations -0.01 to 0.01), with BW and BSA best removing the effects of all the measures of body size. CONCLUSION: Conventional linear correction for body size is inaccurate in children and paradoxically increases the relationship of the indexed parameter with WT and BSA. Conversely, correction using the optimal AE removes the effect of that variable, with WT best correction for all measures of body size.",M1
18473027,"Relative impact of patient characteristics and radiographic variables on the difficulty of removing impacted mandibular third molars.AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the relative contributions of patient characteristics and radiographic variables to the difficulty of extraction of impacted mandibular third molars in a Nigerian population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients undergoing mandibular third molar extractions were recruited for this prospective cohort study. Specific patient characteristics and radiographic variables were recorded. All extractions were performed under local anesthesia by the same oral surgeon, and the surgical difficulty was assessed based on the duration of surgery. RESULTS: Body weight (BW) (P=0.009) and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) (P=0.004) were the significant patient characteristics while tooth impaction depth (P=0.002), number of roots (P=0.035), and tooth angulation (P=0.003) were the significant radiographic variables associated with surgical difficulty using a univariate analysis. A multiple linear regression model was constructed with these variables using surgical difficulty as the dependent variable. Radiographic factors were found to be the more important determinants of surgical difficulty with the depth of impaction (P=0.038) being the singular most important factor. CONCLUSION: Although the difficulty of surgical removal of impacted lower third molars is dependent on BW, BSA, impaction depth, tooth angulation, and the number of roots, radiographic variables were of greater importance with impaction depth being the most important single factor.",M1
18437147,"Do hypertensive individuals have enlarged aortic root diameters? Insights from studying the various subtypes of hypertension.BACKGROUND: Aortic root diameter (AoD) increases with aging and is related to body size. AoD is also presumed to increase in hypertension. In prior studies, however, after adjusting for age and body size, AoD did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive (NT) individuals. Hypertension is a heterogeneous condition with various subtypes that differ in pathophysiology and age distribution. We assessed whether AoD differs among subjects with the various subtypes of hypertension and nonhypertensive individuals. METHODS: In 1,256 volunteers aged 30-79 years (48% women, 48% hypertensive; all untreated), AoD was measured at the sinuses of Valsalva with transthoracic echocardiography. Using cutoff values based on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, subjects were identified as NT (23%), or prehypertensive (PH, 29%), or as having isolated diastolic (IDH, 6%), isolated systolic (ISH, 12%), or systolic-diastolic (SDH, 30%) hypertension. Groups were compared using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction. RESULTS: AoD increased with age and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) in both men (r = 0.25 and 0.19, respectively) and women (r = 0.30 and 0.22, respectively) (all P &lt; 0.0001). In men, those identified as having IDH, ISH, and SDH each had a 6% larger AoD than NT individuals (all P &lt; 0.05). In women, those identified with ISH and SDH had a 10 and 8% larger AoD than NT individuals, respectively (all P &lt; 0.05). In both sexes, after indexing to BSA, only ISH individuals exhibited larger AoD compared with NT individuals (both P &lt; 0.05). But, with further adjustment for age, these differences were no longer observed. CONCLUSIONS: Even when the subtypes of hypertension are examined separately, age and BSA, not hypertension status, account for the AoD differences between NT and hypertensive subjects.",M1
18379164,"Determination of body surface area and formulas to estimate body surface area using the alginate method.The purpose of this study was to determine the body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) based on the alginate method, to derive formulae for estimating BSA, and to compare the error of the present formula to previous formulas obtained from other countries. We directly measured the entire body surface area of 34 males (20-60 years old, 158.5-187.5 cm in height, 48.5-103.1 kg in body weight) and 31 females (20-63 years old, 140.6-173.1 cm, 36.8-106.1 kg) using alginate. The measurements showed that the BSA had a mean of 18,339 cm(2) (15,416-22,753 cm(2)) for males, and 16,452 cm(2) (12,825-22,025 cm(2)) for females. Based on these measurements, a regression model to estimate BSA was derived: Estimated BSA (cm(2))=73.31 Height (cm)(0.725) x Weight (kg)(0.425) (r(2)=0.999). The mean error of the formula was -0.1%, and did not show any significant difference by gender or body shape. When applied to the datasets (n=506) composed of various races (Caucasians, Africans, and Asians), the mean error of the formula was 0.4% and was smaller than that of DuBois &amp; DuBois's, Gehan &amp; George's, and Mosteller's formulas when applied to the same datasets. The errors of the three previous formulas were also within 2%. Overall, formulas based on the DuBois exponent (Weight(0.425) Height (0.725)) did not show any tendency of overestimation or underestimation by body shape, but other BSA-formulae showed differences by body shape. The present BSA formula has shown good accuracy in Korean adults of all weight categories compared to traditional formulas.",M1
18298786,"Estimations of body surface area in newborns.AIM: To explore the suitability of existing formulas to estimate the body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) of newborns when direct measurement of surface estimation is not practical. METHODS: In 589 term-newborns of normal weight and height, the five estimations (in cm2) were performed using four known BSA formulas by Boyd, Meban, Mosteller and Dubois, and the fifth arithmetic mean of these four formulas (BSA-Mean). RESULTS: BSA-Meban was most similar to the BSA-Mean with a mathematically perfect correlation and the least dissimilarity using Euclidean distance (ED), followed by the Mosteller estimate. The estimations by both Boyd and Dubois showed about a 5% deviation above and below the BSA-Mean, respectively, with a consistent dissimilarity using ED regardless of the same goodness of fit. The degree of deviation increased with the weight and decreased with height. CONCLUSIONS: The formula by Meban is possibly the best BSA estimate for newborns among the existing formulas today, followed by the Mosteller formula. Due to either overestimation or underestimation, two formulas (Boyd and Dubois) are not recommended for surface estimation of newborns. A nomogram for surface estimation is needed for paediatric use especially with increasing preterm birth in modern society.",M1
18287452,"Contrast enhancement in cardiovascular MDCT: effect of body weight, height, body surface area, body mass index, and obesity.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of body weight, height, body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), body mass index (BMI), and obesity on aortic contrast enhancement in cardiac MDCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three consecutive patients underwent cardiac CT angiography on a 64-MDCT scanner. Seventy-five mL of contrast medium (350 mg I/mL) was injected at 4.5 mL/s, followed by a 40-mL saline flush at 4.5 mL/s. The scanning delay of CT was determined with a bolus tracking technique. Aortic attenuation was measured over the aortic-root lumen. BMI and BSA were calculated from the patient's body weight and height. The patients were divided into low-(BMI &lt; 30) and high-(&gt; or = 30) BMI groups. Associations of aortic attenuation with body weight, height, BMI, and BSA were evaluated with regression analysis and the Student's t test. RESULTS: Strong inverse correlations were seen between aortic attenuation and body weight (r = -0.73), height (r = -0.47), BMI (r = -0.63), and BSA (r = -0.74) (p &lt; 0.001 for all). The regression formula of aortic attenuation versus body weight suggests that 1.0 mL/kg of contrast medium would yield a mean aortic attenuation of 355 H. The mean aortic attenuation was significantly higher in the low-BMI (352.6 +/- 59.1 H) than in the high-BMI (286.2 +/- 55.5 H) group. The regression formula for aortic attenuation on body weight was aortic attenuation = 586-3.1 body weight (p &lt; 0.001) for the low-BMI group and aortic attenuation = 485-1.9 body weight (p &lt; 0.001) for the high-BMI group, suggesting that the amount of contrast medium required with increased body weight is less in the high-BMI group. This group difference was less pronounced for the regression of aortic attenuation on BSA. CONCLUSION: To achieve a consistent contrast enhancement in cardiac CT angiography (CTA), contrast-medium dose should be adjusted with the body weight or the BSA (which accounts for both the body weight and height factors) to provide adjustment of iodine dose over a wide range of body sizes.",M1
18241292,"Standardized bench method for evaluating the efficacy of phototherapy devices.AIM: As phototherapy (PT) devices employ a variety of broadband light sources, we developed and tested a standardized bench method for evaluating the efficacy of some devices. METHODS: To evaluate efficacy, we quantified the in vitro photodegradation rate (expressed as t1/2) of unconjugated bilirubin in solution at 37 degrees C during exposure to a given light source at its mean delivered irradiance to the 2D body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) of newborn models. Reproducibility (between-day variation) of the method was determined at irradiance levels from 10 to 70 microW/cm2/nm on three different days. RESULTS: Between-day t1/2 measurements had coefficients of variation from 3% to 10%. When t1/2 values were normalized to the exposable 2D horizontal BSA, halogen lamp devices, without and with fiberoptics, were least effective (t1/2=60-108 min and 100-126 min for preterm and term models, respectively). Fluorescent tube devices had t1/2=19-78 min and 25-78 min, for preterm and term models, respectively. Light-emitting diode (LED)-based devices yielded the shortest t1/2 values (16-24 min) for preterm and term newborn models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the applicability of the method through the determination of the efficacy of several commercially available PT devices. This standardized method is reproducible and effectively evaluates the relative in vitro efficacy of various devices and may guide further in vitro and in vivo evaluations of devices.",M1
18224556,"Association between glomerular filtration rate and extracellular fluid volume in normal subjects and patients with renal impairment.The aim of the study was to determine the extent to which glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured with one filtration marker is associated with extracellular fluid volume (ECV) measured independently with another. Cr-51-EDTA and iohexol were injected simultaneously into opposite arms in 20 normal volunteers and 60 patients. Cubital samples taken bilaterally at 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min were assayed for marker injected contralaterally. GFR was scaled to body surface area of 1.73 m(2) (GFR/<e>BSA</e>). GFR was also expressed as marker transit time (GFR/ECV) and ECV as the product of marker transit time and GFR/BSA. In normal subjects, changes between fasting and non-fasting ECV/BSA correlated positively with changes in GFR/BSA, but not GFR/ECV. GFR/BSA and GFR/ECV correlated positively (regression slope approximately 4 ml.min(-1).litre(-1)) and negatively (-2.7 ml x min(-1) x litre(-1)), respectively, with ECV/BSA. The difference, 6.7 ml x min(-1) x litre(-1), expressed as a fraction of average scaled GFR ( approximately 90 ml x min(-1)) is close to the reciprocal of average ECV/BSA (13.5 litres.1.73 m(-2)), consistent with the expected slope of the regression on ECV/BSA of the difference-to-average ratio of GFR/BSA and GFR/ECV. In contrast, in 29 patients with impaired GFR (estimated from plasma creatinine), ECV/BSA correlated inversely with GFR/ECV (slope approximately -5 ml x min(-1) x litre(-1)) but showed no relation with GFR/BSA. We conclude that in normal subjects GFR/BSA increases in response to increasing ECV/BSA, but the increase is not proportionate, leading to a weak inverse association between GFR/ECV and ECV/BSA. When ECV is expanded in patients with renal impairment, however, there is no GFR response, leading to a reduction in GFR/ECV.",M1
18187821,"SCORTEN: does it need modification?BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a drug induced acute life threatening condition with mortality ranging from about 15 to 60%. A 'severity of illness' score termed as SCORTEN has been developed to predict mortality in TEN cases at the time of admission. It is calculated by giving one point for each of predetermined seven variables, evaluated during first 24 hours of admission. Total score ranging from 1-7 predicts a probability of mortality from 0.03 to 0.90. AIM: A prospective study was conducted to analyze efficacy of 'SCORTEN' in TEN cases to predict mortality during their management. METHODS: All cases of TEN reporting for management to the hospital were assessed using 'SCORTEN' on day one and day five to predict probable mortality, this data was then compared with ultimate outcome. RESULTS: During the study period, we treated 10 cases of TEN, all induced by drugs, patient's age ranging from 03 to 70 years and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) involvement from 10 to 95%. Three cases succumbed to death. These cases were analyzed with SCORTEN to predict probability of mortality at the time of admission and day five. We encountered some variations from the original study. It was observed that if patients are analyzed with SCORTEN on a daily/alternate day basis, it will serve as a better predictor of mortality. CONCLUSION: Body surface area (BSA) involvement and age probably need more weightage in calculations. Besides malignancy, tuberculosis and pre-existing diabetes also need to be included while predicting mortality.",M1
17942826,"Dose translation from animal to human studies revisited.As new drugs are developed, it is essential to appropriately translate the drug dosage from one animal species to another. A misunderstanding appears to exist regarding the appropriate method for allometric dose translations, especially when starting new animal or clinical studies. The need for education regarding appropriate translation is evident from the media response regarding some recent studies where authors have shown that resveratrol, a compound found in grapes and red wine, improves the health and life span of mice. Immediately after the online publication of these papers, the scientific community and popular press voiced concerns regarding the relevance of the dose of resveratrol used by the authors. The animal dose should not be extrapolated to a human equivalent dose (HED) by a simple conversion based on body weight, as was reported. For the more appropriate conversion of drug doses from animal studies to human studies, we suggest using the body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) normalization method. BSA correlates well across several mammalian species with several parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function. We advocate the use of BSA as a factor when converting a dose for translation from animals to humans, especially for phase I and phase II clinical trials.",M1
17918143,"A modified Cockcroft-Gault formula taking into account the body surface area gives a more accurate estimation of the glomerular filtration rate.We sought to validate the improvement by adjustment for body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) of the accuracy of the original Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), in a prospective cross-sectional study of 269 European patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We compared 3 methods: original Cockcroft-Gault equation, modified Cockcroft-Gault formula adjusted for BSA and abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, using inulin clearance. Statistical analyses comprised repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), determination of the Pearson coefficient of correlation and a Bland-Altman concordance study. The ability of the GFR estimates to properly categorize patients in K/DOQI stages of CKD was also examined. Inulin clearance differed significantly from the standard Cockcroft-Gault method (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) and the abbreviated MDRD method (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) but not from the BSA-modified Cockcroft-Gault formula. Inulin clearance correlated better with the BSA-modified Cockcroft-Gault formula (r=0.88) and abbreviated MDRD equation (r=0.87) than with the standard Cockcroft-Gault equation (r=0.82). In concordance studies, bias was far smaller with the BSA-modified Cockcroft-Gault formula (mean bias -1.75 ml/min), than with the standard Cockcroft-Gault equation (mean bias -4.72 ml/min). The bias of the abbreviated MDRD was larger (mean bias +6.24 ml/min). Only patients with CKD stage 1 were better categorized with the BSA-modified Cockcroft-Gault formula and with the standard Cockcroft-Gault estimate than with the abbreviated MDRD equation. We conclude that adjustment for body surface area improves accuracy of the original Cockcroft-Gault equation.",M1
17906396,"Arterial blood flow of all abdominal-pelvic organs using Doppler ultrasound: range, variability and physiological impact.The pulsed Doppler method theoretically enables human arterial blood flow (BF) to be determined in all of the abdominal-pelvic organs (BF(AP)) by subtracting the bilateral proximal femoral arterial BF from the upper abdominal aorta BF above the coeliac trunk. Evaluation of BF(AP) is a potentially useful indicator of exercise or food intake related flow distribution to organs; however, there is a lack of information regarding the physiological significance of BF(AP), and the measurements are yet to be validated. The aims of the present study are to examine the range in BF(AP) among subjects, monitor physiological day-to-day variability in BF(AP) over three different days and then determine whether mean BF(AP) (averaged over the three different measurement days) is related to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). Forty healthy males (19-39 years) with a wide range of body weights (51-89 kg) were evaluated in a sitting position following a 12 h fast. The above-mentioned three conduit arteries were measured to determine BF(AP) using pulsed Doppler with spectral analysis. The mean BF(AP) was 2078 +/- 495 ml min(-1) (mean +/- SD) (range, 1153-3285 ml min(-1)), which is in agreement with a previous study that measured the sum of BF in the major part of the coeliac, mesenteric and renal arteries. The physiological day-to-day variability (mean coefficient of variation) was 14.5 +/- 10.0%. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) positive linear relationships were observed between BF(AP) and BSA as well as body weight, which is in good agreement with the results of a previous study. The present data suggest that BF(AP) determined by three-conduit arterial hemodynamics may be a valid measurement that encompasses physiologic flow to multiple abdominal-pelvic organ systems.",M1
17766650,"Flat-fixed dosing versus body surface area based dosing of anticancer drugs in adults: does it make a difference?The current practice of using body-surface area (<e>BSA</e>) in dosing anticancer agents was implemented in clinical oncology half a century ago. By correcting for BSA, it was generally assumed that cancer patients would receive a dose of a particular cytotoxic drug associated with an acceptable degree of toxicities without reducing the agent's therapeutic effect. More recently, doubt has arisen to this hypothesis, and for many drugs, the effects of BSA on the pharmacokinetics of these agents have therefore been studied retrospectively. In (by far) most cases, use of BSA does not reduce the interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of adults, and thus, a logical rationale for further use of this tool in dosing adults is lacking. As a result, alternative dosing strategies have been proposed in order to replace BSA-based dosing. Flat-fixed dosing regimens have been suggested, thereby avoiding potential dose calculation mistakes. As flat-fixed dosing does not typically lead to greater pharmacokinetic variability, it does not seem worse than using BSA-based dosing. While it provides a simplification, it can, however, be questioned whether to call this an improvement or not. The implementation of so-called genotyping and phenotyping strategies, and therapeutic drug monitoring, may probably be of more clinical value. In the end, the nonscientifically based BSA-based dosing strategy should be replaced by alternative strategies. Despite the lack of basic fundamentals, BSA-based dosing still seems  untouchable  in clinical oncology. Even when alternatives will be shown to be indisputably better, many hurdles will probably have to be overcome before physicians will be willing to ban BSA-based dosing. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",M1

The purpose of this study was to determine the hand surface area to the total body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and derive a formula for estimating HSA. Thirty-four Korean males (20-60 years old; 158.5-187.5 cm in height; 48.5-103.1 kg in body weight) and thirty-one Korean females (20-63 years old; 140.6-173.1 cm; 36.8-106.1 kg) participated as subjects. The HSA and BSA of 65 subjects were directly measured using alginate. The measurements showed 1) the surface area of the hand had a mean of 448 (371-540) cm(2) for males, and 392 (297-482) cm(2) for females. 2) The hand as a percentage of the total body surface area for males and females was 2.5% and 2.4% respectively, showing no significant difference. 3) The hand as a percentage of BSA by body shape was 2.5% for the lean group and 2.3% for overweight people (p=0.001). 4) When estimating the surface area of a hand, formulae based on hand length or hand circumference were more valid than formulae based on height and body weight. We obtained the following formula for estimating HSA: Estimated HSA(cm(2))=1.219 Hand length(cm) x Hand circumference(cm).",M1
17675331,"GFR determination in adults with a single-sample iohexol plasma clearance method based on the mean sojourn time.BACKGROUND: Glomerular filtration rate is a key parameter in kidney disease. The Radionuclides in Nephrourology Committee has recommended a single-sample method with 99mTc-DTPA based on the mean sojourn time. This study was done to develop the method for use with iohexol making the method more available. METHODS: The single-sample formula was derived for group I (n = 48, Cl = 8-188 ml/min) and applied on group II (n = 47) and on group III (n = 123). In groups I and II, reference clearance was determined according to Sapirstein and in group III according to Brøchner-Mortensen. RESULTS: The formula Cls= (-b+sqrt b2-4ac)/(2a) (a = (-6.49 x 10(-6) x t + 8.85 x 10(-4)) x t, b = 1.143 x t and c = ln[(C(t))x(ECV/Q0)](ECV) was derived for patients with estimated Cl &gt; 30 ml/min with the best result if the single sample was obtained between 4 and 5 h. Extracellular volume was estimated as ECV =9985 x <e>BSA</e> - 3431. The formula ClS(24 h) = -ln[(C(t)) x (ECV/Q0)](ECV)/(t) was developed for patients with estimated Cl &lt;30 ml/min with a single sample at 24 h. With this combined approach SDdiff was 2.7 ml/min in group II and 3.1 ml/min in group III. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate determination of iohexol clearance can be obtained from a single plasma sample applying the mean sojourn time approach. A separate formula must be used for patients with low clearance values. Body surface area (BSA), injected amount of iohexol (Q0), time when the single sample is drawn (t) and the concentration of iohexol [C(t)] in the sample are needed for the calculations.",M1
17596911,"Annular and septal Doppler tissue imaging in children: normal z-score tables and effects of age, heart rate, and body surface area.The aim of this study was to construct normal z-score tables for longitudinal directed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) systolic wave (S), DTI early diastolic wave (E'), and DTI late diastolic wave (A') at the mitral valve annulus (MV), superior ventricular septum (VS), and tricuspid valve annulus (TV) in pediatric patients. We analyzed normal echocardiograms from 634 children aged 1 day to 18 years, heart rate (HR) range of 50 to 194/min, and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) range of 0.1 to 2.8 m2. First we determined the effects of age, HR, and BSA on the S, E', and A' at the MV, VS, and TV sampling sites by univariate analysis. Next we determined which of the 3 factors, age versus HR versus BSA, correlated best with the S, E', and A' at each of the 3 sampling sites by multivariate analysis. Finally, using the specific factor of age versus HR versus BSA that best predicted a particular DTI wave at a particular sampling site, we constructed z-score tables for each of the 3 DTI parameters at each of the 3 sampling sites. The S range was: MV = 2.2 to 23.2 cm/s; VS = 1.6 to 22.3 cm/s; and TV = 1.8 to 31.3 cm/s. By univariate analysis the S correlated negatively with HR and positively with age and BSA with strong correlations at all 3 sites. By multiple regression analysis the S correlated best with age at all 3 sites. The E' range was: MV = 2.4 to 37.1 cm/s; VS = 1.8 to 29.0 cm/s; and TV = 2.4 to 32.4 cm/s. The E' varied negatively with HR and positively with age and BSA with strong correlations by univariate analysis at all 3 sites. By multiple regression, the E' correlated best with age for the VS and TV sites, and correlated best with HR at the MV site. The E' at the MV site also strongly correlated with age by multivariate analysis. The A' range was: MV = 2.9 to 20.7 cm/s; VS = 2.7 to 18.2 cm/s; and TV = 1.1 to 29.3 cm/s. The A' had a strong positive correlation with HR at all 3 sites, a strong negative correlation with BSA and age at the TV site only, with no statistical significant correlation of the MV and VS site A' to BSA or age. Using multiple regression analysis the A' correlated best with HR at all 3 sites. Z-score tables developed from a large sample volume encompassing the entire spectrum of ages, HR, and BSA encountered in pediatric patients and developed using the strongest predicting factor serve as reference data for longitudinal directed DTI annular and septal S, E', and A' normal values in children.",M1
17595792,"Pilot study of simplified low-dose S-1 plus CPT-11 as first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: S-1 is a novel oral anticancer drug, composed of tegafur (FT), gimestat (CDHP) and otastat potassium (Oxo) in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. S-1 plus irinotecan (CPT-11) administered for advanced colorectal cancer could be expected to show as equally good results as the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with CPT-11 (FOLFIRI) regimen. When toxicity is too severe preventing patients from receiving an intensive chemotherapeutic regimen, survival benefit might be forfeited. A pilot study of low-dose S-1 plus CPT-11 therapy with constant doses without consideration of body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) was therefore performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. S-1 was given orally at 40 mg b.i.d. for 21 consecutive days followed by a 14-day rest period. CPT-11 was administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion at a dose of 80 mg on days 1 and 15. Courses of treatment were repeated every 35 days. RESULTS: The median age was 62.5 years (26-74). The median cycles were 8.5 (3-20). The overall response rate was 45.5% (complete response (CR), 1; partial response (PR), 9). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival time (MST) were 9.0 and 20.2 months respectively. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed. Eight patients (36.4%) did not have any sign or symptom of toxicity throughout all the treatment courses. The response, survival and toxicity were not significantly different according to BSA. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that simplified low-dose S-1 plus CPT-11 treatment might be of considerable advantage as first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer who would like to avoid toxicity.",M1
17593513,"Estimation of 24-hour urine protein quantity by the morning-urine protein/creatinine ratio.BACKGROUND: Many reports have described a correlation between the morning-urine protein /creatinine ratio (morning urine P/Cr) and the quantity of 24-h urine protein (Up), as well as regression formulas for Up with morning-urine P/Cr. However, there is no universal regression formula that can be used at all facilities. It is still controversial whether a qualitative calculation is required at outpatient clinics. To develop a practical and universal method, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate Up from morning-urine P/Cr. METHODS: The subjects were 34 children (309 specimens) with kidney disease who had been admitted to Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital. We examined the correlations of P/Cr with Up and Up/body surface area (Up/<e>BSA</e>) using morning and daytime urine. We determined the cutoff values to estimate Up/BSA from morning-urine P/Cr with an ROC analysis. Next, we applied the values to specimens obtained from other facilities to show the universality of this approach. RESULTS: Up/BSA for samples in one hospital was significantly correlated with morning-urine P/C. When the morning-urine P/Cr ratio is &gt;or=1.0 or &gt;or=2.0, the Up/BSA ratio will exceed 0.5 or 1.0 (g/m(2) per day), respectively, and the efficiency was sufficiently high (efficiency for Up/BSA of &gt;or=0.5: 88.0%, efficiency for Up/BSA of &gt;or=1.0: 90.9%). When we analyzed samples from two other facilities with these cutoff values, both the sensitivity and specificity were greater than 80% for both facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cutoff values of 1.0 and 2.0 for morning-urine P/Cr determined by ROC analysis could be a universal method for quantitatively estimating Up/BSA &gt;or=0.5 and 1.0, respectively.",M1
17543749,"Right ventricular Tei index in children: effect of method, age, body surface area, and heart rate.The right ventricular (RV) Tei index (RVTX) has been used to analyze systolic and diastolic global RV function in various congenital and acquired cardiac abnormalities in children. We conducted a study to determine the effects of the methods of Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) versus pulse wave Doppler (PWD) and age, body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), and heart rate on the RVTX in a population of 308 children with normal echocardiogram findings. Participants ranged in age from 1 day to 18 years, with BSA from 0.08 to 2.4 m2 and heart rate from 46 to 182/min. The RVTX was calculated by both DTI and PWD in each patient during a single echocardiographic examination. RVTX-DTI = 0.37 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD) versus RVTX-PWD = 0.34 +/- 0.06 were slightly but statistically different (P &lt; .001). Univariate linear regression analysis showed age and BSA both had small but significant positive effects on both the RVTX-DTI and RVTX-PWD, and heart rate had a small but significant negative effect on both techniques (all with P &lt; .01). By multivariate regression analysis RVTX-DTI was significantly affected only by the BSA and the RVTX-PWD only by age (both with P &lt; .05). Therefore, one must consider the method of RVTX measurement, the BSA for RVTX-DTI, and the age for RVTX-PWD to accurately assess RVTX values.",M1
17517238,"Growth hormone treatment and left ventricular dimensions in Turner syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cardiac dimensions were different in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) who received growth hormone (GH) compared with those who did not receive GH. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed echocardiograms in 86 females with TS divided into GH-treated (n = 67) and untreated (n = 19) groups. The subjects all participated in the National Institutes of Health protocol between 2001 and 2006. RESULTS: The average age was 16.2 years (range, 10 to 25 years), and average duration of GH treatment was 4.4 years (range, 1 to 14 years). The GH-treated group was taller by approximately 7 cm (P = .004), but cardiac dimensions normalized to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), including septal and posterior wall thickness and left ventricular (LV) mass and internal diameters, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The fractional shortening index was similar in the 2 groups. Multiple regression analyses indicated that BSA, but not duration of GH treatment, predicted LV dimensions in girls with TS. CONCLUSIONS: GH treatment of girls with TS increases stature but does not disproportionately affect cardiac dimensions.",M1
17486397,"Left ventricular mass in 169 healthy children and young adults assessed by three-dimensional echocardiography.The aims of this study were to establish normal values of left ventricular (LV) mass in children and young adults using three-dimensional echocardiography (3-DE) and to compare 3-DE LV mass estimates with those obtained by conventional echocardiographic methods. We studied 169 healthy subjects aged 2-27 years by digitized 3-D, two-dimensional (2-D), and M-mode echocardiography. 3-D echocardiography was performed by using rotational acquisition of planes at 18 degrees intervals from apical view with ECG gating and without respiratory gating. 3-DE gave smaller LV mass estimates than 2-DE and M-mode echocardiography (p &lt; 0.001). Agreement analysis resulted in a bias of -9.3 +/- 36.5 g between 3-DE and 2-DE, and -18.5 +/- 47.9 g between 3-DE and M-mode. For the analysis, the subjects were divided into five groups according to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>): 0.5-0.75, 0.75-1.0, 1.0-1.25, 1.25-1.5, and greater than 1.5 m(2). LV mass/BSA by 3-DE was 45.6 (5.1), 54.3 (7.7), 55.2 (7.9), 58.8 (8.1), and 65.0 (9.9) g/m(2). LV mass/end diastolic volume (EDV) by 3-DE was 0.9 (0.1) g/ml in the BSA group of 0.5-0.75 m(2) and 1.0 (0.2) g/ml in the other BSA groups. LV mass increased linearly in relation to BSA, height, and body mass (r = 0.93, 0.90, and 0.92, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The results showed a linear increase in LV mass, whereas LV mass/EDV ratio remained unchanged. However, LV mass estimates by 3-DE were lower than those obtained by 2-DE and M-mode echocardiography. The data obtained by 3-DE from 169 healthy subjects will serve as a reference for further studies in patients with various cardiac abnormalities.",M1
17445062,"The origin of the 1 x 73-m2 body surface area normalization: problems and implications.A historical review of the origins of body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) determination reveals a number of theoretical and methodological errors, as does the choice of 1 x 73 m(2) as the normal BSA for humans. BSA normalization is justifiable for some physiological variables, e.g. glomerular filtration rate and cardiac output, but not all. However, other normalization indices, in particular extracellular volume, offer theoretical and practical advantages compared with BSA. While the choice of the figure 1 x 73 m(2) is essentially arbitrary, and inapplicable to modern Western populations, its retention as a permanent physiological constant is recommended, in order to permit international and historical comparisons.",M1
17401231,"Determining standard liver volume: assessment of existing formulae in Indian population.BACKGROUND: With the increasing numbers of living-related donor liver transplantation, accurate means of calculating standard liver volume (SLV) based on patient body indices becomes important. Three formulae reported in literature for this purpose have been derived from studies on Western and Japanese populations. AIM: To assess the existing formulae for calculation of SLV in Indian population. METHOD: Total liver volume (TLV) of 238 patients was measured using axial helical CT images obtained for conditions unrelated to the hepatobiliary system. Body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) was calculated from height and weight. Measurements obtained using CT were compared with the SLV calculated based on the previously reported formulae. RESULTS: Though there was significant difference (p&lt; 0.001) between the TLV obtained by CT and the SLV calculated using the three formulae, they also showed good agreement. On an average the formula derived from the Japanese population underestimated the SLV by 63 (202) cc (p&lt; 0.001). Regression models for SLV (SLV = 243 + [186 x BSA] + [11.4 x Weight], SLV = 375.23 + [14.24 x body weight], SLV = -204.092 + [874.461 x BSA]) were derived from the data obtained from our population. Age and gender had no effect on the SLV. CONCLUSIONS: Formulae derived from Japanese population for calculation of SLV is not suitable for the Indian population. The newly described formulae may prove useful in the Indian population.",M1
17385719,"Diagnostic value of the 16-detector row multislice spiral computed tomography for the detection of coronary artery stenosis in comparison to invasive coronary angiography.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of 16-slice multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) of the coronaries and to provide data in a real clinical setting. Previous 16-slice MSCT studies presented data excluding patients with calcification, vessels of &lt; 1.5 or 2 mm, and segments with impaired image quality. By including these data for 16-slice MSCT, a direct comparison with new data from 64-slice MSCT is possible. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty two patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) were prospectively enrolled and underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All vessels were evaluated for the presence of a significant coronary artery stenosis (&gt;50%) using the American Heart Association (AHA) 15-segment model. From the evaluation of 917 segments, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value (NPV) (positive predictive value [PPV] and NPV) for the presence of relevant coronary stenosis were 73, 98, and 71 and 98% per segment and 94, 90, and 91 and 93% per patient, respectively. The influence of age, gender, body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), heart rate (HR), stents, and Ca(2+)-score value was analyzed. High Ca(2+)-score values were the only statistically significant predictor for impaired diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, CTA with evaluation of all vessel segments in a broad spectrum of patients allowed accurate and fast noninvasive coronary artery evaluation, including evaluation of stented segments. These data are very similar to those published recently for 64-slice scanners.",M1
17363397,"The problems in scaling adult drug doses to children.BACKGROUND: Many drugs are unlicensed in children and consequently their doses have been scaled down from those used in adults. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of three scaling models in predicting maintenance doses for children from those used in adults. METHODS: Three scaling models based on body weight (BW), body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) and BW(0.75) were used to predict maintenance doses across the paediatric age band from the equivalent adult doses for 30 different drugs. The predicted doses were compared with those in the British National Formulary for children 2006 (BNFc). Percentage error and mean squared prediction error were used as a measure of precision, and mean prediction error was used as a measure of bias. RESULTS: In the 1-month and 12-month age groups, the different approaches ranked on their bias (least bias first) were BW&lt;BW(0.75)&lt;BSA and on their precision (most precise first) were BW&gt;BW(0.75)&gt;BSA. The BSA and BW(0.75) methods predicted doses up to 2.86-fold higher than the BNFc in the 1-month and 1-year age group. In the 7-year and 12-year age groups, BW(0.75) and BSA performed better than BW for precision and bias, and no predictions were more than 1.8-fold higher than the BNFc. The BW method tended to also under-predict dose across the paediatric age range. CONCLUSIONS: Dose scaling should only be used as a last resort for determining a suitable dose in children. No single method was suitable across the entire paediatric age range.",M1
17305252,"Chemotherapy dosing part I: scientific basis for current practice and use of body surface area.Cytotoxic chemotherapy is characterised by a low therapeutic index and significant variability in therapeutic and toxic effects. In an attempt to reduce this variability, most chemotherapy doses are individualised according to patient body surface area (<e>BSA</e>). This practice, which was introduced almost 50 years ago, clearly has practical and economic implications for the healthcare system. Furthermore, the clinical value of this approach has, in recent years, been questioned. Despite established practice, chemotherapy dose selection remains complicated, partly because treatment effects are difficult to measure, partly because drugs are used in combination with other treatment modalities, and also because the patient's condition may change with disease progression. Various patient-related factors can affect drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), for example organ function, expression and activity of metabolising enzymes, drug resistance, body size, gender, age, concomitant disease and co-administration of other drugs. These factors may be of clinical significance in chemotherapy dose determination and measures of PK, PD or both feature in attempts to devise more rigorous methods for chemotherapy dosing. Part I of this series of two reviews describes the history and clinical impact of BSA-based chemotherapy, and examines the scientific evidence to support BSA dosing. It evaluates the factors affecting PK and PD for specific drugs that could inform and refine dose determination.",M1
17051739,"Prediction of maximal oxygen consumption from body mass, height and body surface area in young sedentary subjects.The study was aimed to establish prediction norms for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) from age, body mass and body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) in young sedentary subjects of Kolkata, India. Students of 20-24 years (male = 40 and female = 40) were recruited by simple random sampling from University of Calcutta, Kolkata. Thirty participants from each sex were further randomly alloted to the  study group  and rest 10 participants to the  confirmatory group . Physical parameters were measured and VO2max determination comprised of incremental bi-cycle exercise followed by expired gas analysis in Scholander micro-gas analyzer. Significant (P&lt;0.001) correlation of VO2max existed with age, body mass, body height and BSA. Prediction of VO2max in the confirmatory groups using the norms obtained from different physical parameters depicted insignificant variation from the directly measured value of VO2max. Among these equations VO2max prediction from BSA was considered as the most valid one because of its highest correlation coefficient with VO2max in both the sexes. Multiple regression equation for prediction of VO2max from body mass and body height was also computed. The equation established from BSA is recommended as the most reliable and valid to predict VO2max in the young sedentary subjects of Kolkata, India; and multiple regression equations are also recommended for cross-checking the value.",M1
17048973,"Guidelines on paediatric dosing on the basis of developmental physiology and pharmacokinetic considerations.The approach to paediatric drug dosing needs to be based on the physiological characteristics of the child and the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. This review summarises the current knowledge on developmental changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion and combines this knowledge with in vivo and in vitro pharmacokinetic data that are currently available. In addition, dosage adjustments based on practical problems, such as child-friendly formulations and feeding regimens, disease state, genetic make-up and environmental influences are presented. Modification of a dosage based on absorption, depends on the route of absorption, the physico chemical properties of the drug and the age of the child. For oral drug absorption, a distinction should be made between the very young and children over a few weeks old. In the latter case, it is likely that practical considerations, like appropriate formulations, have much greater relevance to oral drug absorption. The volume of distribution (V(d)) may be altered in children. Hydrophilic drugs with a high V(d) in adults should be normalised to bodyweight in young children (age &lt;2 years), whereas hydrophilic drugs with a low V(d) in adults should be normalised to body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) in these children. For drugs that are metabolised by the liver, the effect of the V(d) becomes apparent in children &lt;2 months of age. In general, only the first dose should be based on the V(d); subsequent doses should be determined by the clearance. Pharmacokinetic studies on renal and liver function clarify that a distinction should be made between maturation and growth of the organs. After the maturation process has finished, the main influences on the clearance of drugs are growth and changes in blood flow of the liver and kidney. Drugs that are primarily metabolised by the liver should be administered with extreme care until the age of 2 months. Modification of dosing should be based on response and on therapeutic drug monitoring. At the age of 2-6 months, a general guideline based on bodyweight may be used. After 6 months of age, BSA is a good marker as a basis for drug dosing. However, even at this age, drugs that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase should be normalised to bodyweight. In the first 2 years of life, the renal excretion rate should be determined by markers of renal function, such as serum creatinine and p-aminohippuric acid clearance. A dosage guideline for drugs that are significantly excreted by the kidney should be based on the determination of renal function in first 2 years of life. After maturation, the dose should be normalised to BSA. These guidelines are intended to be used in clinical practice and to form a basis for more research. The integration of these guidelines, and combining them with pharmacodynamic effects, should be considered and could form a basis for further study.",M1
17028453,"PAC fixed dose: pharmacokinetics of a 1-hour paclitaxel infusion and comparison to <e>BSA</e>-normalized drug dosing.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of a 175-mg fixed dose of paclitaxel (PAC) after a 1-h infusion in cancer patients and to compare them with the PK parameters from a study with a dose normalized to the body surface area (BSA) (100 mg/m2). PATIENTS AND METHODS: PAC PKs were studied during the first course of therapy in 13 patients. A fixed dose of 175 mg PAC was administered weekly by a 1-h infusion to patients with advanced cancer. Total PAC in serum was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental and model-dependent methods. RESULTS: The mean BSA of 12 patients (1 patient excluded from all analyses because of prolonged infusion duration) was 1.79 m2 (coefficient of variation (CV) 7.8%), the mean dose referred to the individual BSAs was 98.3 mg/m2 (CV 8.3%). The mean area under the curve (AUC) was 6,193 ng/ml x h (CV 46%), the mean plasma clearance (Clp) was 19.7 l/h/m2 (CV 45%), and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 121.6 l/m2 (CV 52%). The mean residence time (MRT) was 7.6 h (CV 46%), the mean distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) of PAC(tot) was 0.4 h (CV 62%), and the elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) 10.0 h (CV 42%). Maximum plasma concentration Cmax was 3,161 ng/ml (CV 36%). The mean time above 0.05 microM (42.7 ng/ml) was 19.7 h, and the mean time above 0.1 microM (85.4 ng/ml) was 10.6 h. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a fixed dose of PAC of 175 mg corresponds to a mean BSA-normalized dose of 98.3 mg/m2 (range 88.8-117.4 mg/m2). A higher variability of PK parameters was observed compared to previously published results of a PK study with BSA-normalized dosing of 100 mg/m2. However, the AUC and the time above threshold concentrations did not depend on the dose. Therefore, a fixed dose of 175 mg weekly could be an option for palliative treatment with PAC and may offer a simple but effective schedule for PAC treatment.",M1
17028412,"Effect of body surface area calculations on body fat estimates in non-obese and obese subjects.The purpose of the present study was to compare body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) estimates using two equations (Dubois and Dubois versus Livingston) and their respective effects on per cent body fat (%BF) obtained with two molecular approaches of body composition analysis, two-compartment (2C) and five-compartment (5C) models. Body composition data using the 2C model were studied in healthy adults, 432 women (body mass index (BMI): 28.3 +/- 4.4 kg m(-2)) and 147 men (BMI: 26.8 +/- 3.9 kg m(-2)), while another sample of 126 women (BMI: 30.4 +/- 3.7 kg m(-2)) was evaluated using the 5C model. Measures of body volume (BV) assessed by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and total-body water by deuterium dilution were used to estimate %BF with the 5C model. Comparison of means and linear regression analysis was performed. Using BSA(Dubois), either in 2C and 5C models, BV and %BF estimates were significantly underestimated compared to results obtained using BSA(Livingston) (p &lt; 0.05). BMI was strongly associated with %BF differences using BSA(Dubois) and BSA(Livingston) in both 2C (men: r = 0.90; women: r = 0.88) and 5C models (r = 0.88). Though %BF(Dubois) and %BF(Livingston) were strongly associated (r(2) = 1.000), some variability was observed on %BF differences using BSA(Dubois) and BSA(Livingston). These findings suggest that BSA calculation is critical in BF estimation, supporting the use of a more accurate equation for non-obese and obese subjects.",M1
16971317,"How much of a topical agent should be prescribed for children of different sizes?BACKGROUND: Compared with guidelines for the quantity of topical corticosteroids to apply in adults, standards for the use of topical corticosteroids in children are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To devise simple-to-use guidelines for topical corticosteroid quantities needed in infants, children, pre-teens, and adults. METHODS: We determined body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) using mean heights and weights in order to calculate the appropriate quantities of medication to be prescribed. RESULTS: As a rough estimate, infants require one-fifth of adult doses, children two-fifths of adult doses, and adolescents two-thirds of adult doses. However, the assessment of BSA may vary considerably between clinicians. Patients may also vary in how thickly they apply topical medication. CONCLUSIONS: A simple guideline for how much topical corticosteroid to prescribe may facilitate the treatment of young children with skin disease.",M1

Since newborns have an exceptionally large surface to mass ratio, their BSA needs to be accurately estimated, if it is to serve as a safe denominator for drugs and fluids. In this study, BSA was measured directly in 15 full-term Saudi newborns, using a coating technique. The data was used to construct a BSA weight-length prediction formula. Mean body mass index (BMI +/-SD) of our subjects was 12.56 +/- 1.29 kg/m2 and surface to mass ratio, .068 +/- .005 m2/kg. The closest fit to measured values was given by the regression equation: BSA (m2) = 0.03614H(0.294)W(0.529) +/- 0.0027 (SEE) A simplified formula based on weight alone: BSA = 7.4 + 4.2W +/- 0.0022(SEE) was derived for bedside use, in urgent situations. Our formulae may be applicable to non-Saudi newborns, if as expected, body size and shape variations in different populations develop after birth.",M1
16912889,"Pharmacokinetics of low-dose nedaplatin and validation of AUC prediction in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of low-dose nedaplatin combined with paclitaxel and radiation therapy in patients having non-small-cell lung carcinoma and establish the optimal dosage regimen for low-dose nedaplatin. We also evaluated predictive accuracy of reported formulas to estimate the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of low-dose nedaplatin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 19 patients were administered a constant intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m(2) body surface area (<e>BSA</e>) nedaplatin for an hour, and blood samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 19 h after the administration. Plasma concentrations of unbound platinum were measured, and the actual value of platinum AUC (actual AUC) was calculated based on these data. The predicted value of platinum AUC (predicted AUC) was determined by three predictive methods reported in previous studies, consisting of Bayesian method, limited sampling strategies with plasma concentration at a single time point, and simple formula method (SFM) without measured plasma concentration. Three error indices, mean prediction error (ME, measure of bias), mean absolute error (MAE, measure of accuracy), and root mean squared prediction error (RMSE, measure of precision), were obtained from the difference between the actual and the predicted AUC, to compare the accuracy between the three predictive methods. RESULTS: The AUC showed more than threefold inter-patient variation, and there was a favorable correlation between nedaplatin clearance and creatinine clearance (Ccr) (r = 0.832, P &lt; 0.01). In three error indices, MAE and RMSE showed significant difference between the three AUC predictive methods, and the method of SFM had the most favorable results, in which %ME, %MAE, and %RMSE were 5.5, 10.7, and 15.4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dosage regimen of low-dose nedaplatin should be established based on Ccr rather than on BSA. Since prediction accuracy of SFM, which did not require measured plasma concentration, was most favorable among the three methods evaluated in this study, SFM could be the most practical method to predict AUC of low-dose nedaplatin in a clinical situation judging from its high accuracy in predicting AUC without measured plasma concentration.",M1
16885721,"Therapeutic drug monitoring for dose individualization of Cisplatin in testicular cancer patients based upon total platinum measurement in plasma.Cisplatin (CDDP) is an anticancer agent widely used in testicular cancer, for which pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic relationships have usually been based upon measurement of its unbound fraction in plasma. Because it has been shown that free CDDP clearance can be related to patient's body surface area (<e>BSA</e>), dosage is mostly adjusted a priori using only this single parameter, with mixed results for accurately predicting CDDP exposure and reducing toxicities. In contrast, the authors present here an original, 5-day continuous infusion schedule, coupled to a daily Bayesian adaptive dosing with feedback strategy, based upon the rapid assay of total, rather than free, CDDP in plasma. Nineteen patients (66 therapeutic courses) were treated with platinum-based combinational therapy. Plasma samples were analyzed to allow real-time Bayesian estimation of individual PK parameters with subsequent prospective dose adjustment in order to reach a target Cmax (Cend) of 1.95 mg/L of total platinum. Performance of the Bayesian dosing method was evaluated by comparing target Cmax with achieved Cmax. The mean+/-SD Cmax achieved was 1.93+/-0.16 mg/L. No statistically significant difference was observed between experimental and target values (P&gt;0.05, t test), and Cend achievement was done with an overall 6.6% precision, a performance to be compared with the initial 54% interpatient variability observed in CDDP clearance. A nonlinear mixed effect model population PK analysis was subsequently performed to identify retrospectively the covariates associated with PK parameters of total CDDP. It showed a good correlation (r=0.84, P=0.004) between total platinum clearance and therapeutic course number. A weaker correlation (r=0.59) was found between BSA and total CDDP clearance and, importantly, no additional relationship was established with BSA when successive therapeutic courses, and not only the first one, were considered. This highlights the critical importance of total drug accumulation on CDDP pharmacokinetics when several infusions are to be administered in a row and, therefore, the need for real-time dose individualization that takes into account the course number, rather than BSA. Finally, doses of CDDP administered during each course were significantly higher (+20%, P&lt;0.01) than the ones classically normalized with BSA, thus leading to an overall greater drug exposure in the patients. It is noteworthy that despite these markedly higher doses, little severe toxicity was reported, and all of the patients presented in this study were still alive and disease free after a follow-up of up to 15 years.",M1
20496196,"Effects of bicyclol on immunological liver fibrosis in rats.Liver fibrosis results from chronic liver injury in conjunction with the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. The present study was performed to estimate the effect of bicyclol on bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>)-induced immunological liver fibrosis in rats. Bicyclol (1) (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) was given to rats by oral administration once a day for 5 weeks from the fourth week of intravenous injection of BSA. Blood and liver tissues were collected for the measurement of hydroxyproline (Hyp), procollagen type III (PIIIP), hyaluronic acid (HA), and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) levels and liver pathological changes. The mRNA and protein expressions of hepatic TGF-beta1, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-10, MMP-2, TIMP-1, phosphorylated p38 (Pp38), and Smad2/3 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. As a result, bicyclol significantly protected against BSA-induced liver fibrosis as evidenced by the reduction of elevated serum HA, PIIIP, and hepatic Hyp in rats, while liver pathological changes were also alleviated. The overexpressions of hepatic TGF-beta1, IL-1beta, IL-10, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 were suppressed by bicyclol in BSA-treated rats. The phosphorylations of Pp38 and Smad2/3 were also inhibited after bicyclol treatment. The hepatoprotection of bicyclol was mainly due to the modulation on the expression of inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulation of hepatic TGF-beta1, and inhibition of hepatic collagen synthesis.",M2
20460657,"Effects of an active immunization on the immune response of laying Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) fed with or without genetically modified Bacillus thuringiensis-maize.Potentially adverse effects of diets containing transgenic plants are a concern for many consumers, particularly in Europe. For Bacillus thuringiensis-maize, several studies in livestock and poultry showed that the zootechnical data provide no indication for such adverse effects. These studies were all done in homeostatic situations; it remained open whether a deflection of the regulatory physiological systems might yield divergent dynamic responses in B. thuringiensis-maize-fed animals. We therefore tested the effect of an active immunization using <e>BSA</e> as antigen in a feeding regimen with or without B. thuringiensis-maize using quail as a model organism. Newly hatched Japanese quail were randomly allocated to 2 groups (n=120 per group) fed with diets containing either B. thuringiensis-maize or isogenic maize of the same cultivar. The diets did not differ in concentrations of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, which were both far below guidance values. After 16 wk on the experimental diets, one-half of each group was immunized against BSA. The remaining birds were injected with saline. Thirty-six hours after the injection, half of the BSA-injected subgroup (n=30) and half of the saline subgroup (n=30) from B. thuringiensis-maize- and isogenic-fed birds were killed and blood samples were collected and analyzed for serum zinc levels, indicative for acute phase response. For determining IgY-mediated immune responses, eggs were collected every other week for 6 wk after the injections from the remaining birds and total IgY concentrations and BSA-specific IgY titers were measured in egg yolk. The BSA injections did not elicit significant decreases of serum zinc concentrations. The serum zinc levels were significantly higher in B. thuringiensis-maize-fed quail. Expectedly, total IgY as well as BSA-specific IgY titers increased with time in the BSA-immunized quail. The response of both variables to the BSA injection did not differ between the feeding groups. Our results indicate that feeding of B. thuringiensis-maize does not impair the immune system of Japanese quail and thus gives no indication for respective concerns.",M2
20432626,"Effect of levofloxacin and pefloxacin on humoral immune response elicited by bovine serum albumin docked in gelatin microparticles and nanoparticles.The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of levofloxacin and pefloxacin on the humoral immune response elicited by bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) encapsulated in gelatin particulate systems. FITC-BSA (Fluoresceine isothiocynate-bovine serum albumin) was entrapped in gelatin microparticles (GM) and gelatin nanoparticles (GN) prepared by emulsion polymerization and nanoemulsion methods, respectively. The prepared particulate carriers were evaluated for particle size, surface morphology, entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and in vitro antigen release. The optimized formulation of FITC-BSA loaded GM and GN were administered s.c. to albino rats and humoral immune response was measured in terms of systemic IgG antibody titre by ELISA method. The serum IgG response elicited was compared to that was obtained by s.c. administration of either free antigen or antigen emulsified (1:1) with Freund's in complete adjuvant (FIA). The vaccination of 2.41 +/- 1.56 microm sized GM elicited significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher serum IgG response than that obtained with administration of 107 +/- 25 nm sized GN. Similarly, levofloxacin significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased the antibody titre in rats immunized with BSA docked GM whereas pefloxacin did not reduce the antibody titre significantly. The study will help in programming a new drug management and in characterization of vaccine-drug interaction.",M2
20407699,"Bifunctional polyacrylamide based polymers for the specific binding of hexahistidine tagged proteins on gold surfaces.We describe a modified bifunctional analogue of polyacrylamide that spontaneously forms self-assembled polymeric thin films on Au surfaces. The film is engineered to specifically bind histidine tagged proteins (6His), while simultaneously remaining inherently resistant to the non-specific adsorption of proteins in solution. The backbone of a polyacrylamide-co-n-acryloxysuccinimide copolymer is functionalized via tandem active ester (NHS) couplings with 3-(methylthio)propylamine (MTP) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). The resulting functionalized polymers form stable and exceptionally hydrophilic thin films that are approximately 2-5 nm thick, a mass coverage that varies with the MTP graft density. These films are characterized using a variety of techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), ellipsometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)) to establish their structure and function. The protein resistance of the films, as demonstrated by their exposure to solutions of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), can be modulated by the amount of MTP grafted to the polymer, which in turn, affects their mass coverage. We show that it is possible to specifically capture hexahistidine tagged proteins with low incidences of nonspecific adsorption using these materials, a discrimination quantified using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at concentrations down to approximately 20 nM. These polymers also bind strongly to the surfaces of Au nanoparticles, stabilizing them against aggregation, providing them with a similar capacity to selectively bind 6His tagged proteins that can then be speciated using MALDI.",M2
20381695,"Hapten synthesis and antibody production for the development of a melamine immunoassay.The incorporation of melamine into food products is banned but its misuse has been widely reported in both animal feeds and food. The development of a rapid screening immunoassay for monitoring of the substance is an urgent requirement. Two haptens of melamine were synthesized by introducing spacer arms of different lengths and structures on the triazine ring of the analyte molecular structure. 6-Aminocaproic acid and 3-mercaptopropionic acid were reacted with 2-chloro-4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (CAAT) to produce hapten 1 [3-(4,6-diamino-1,6-dihydro-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino) hexanoic acid] and hapten 2 [3-(4,6-diamino-1,6-dihydro-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylthio) propanoic acid], respectively. The molecular structures of the two haptens were identified by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, mass spectrometry and infrared spectrometry. An immunogen was prepared by coupling hapten 1 to bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). Two plate coating antigens were prepared by coupling both haptens to egg ovalbumin (OVA). A competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ciELISA) was developed to evaluate homogeneous and heterogeneous assay formats. The results showed that polyclonal antibodies with high titers were obtained, and the heterogeneous immunoassay format demonstrated a better performance with an IC(50) of 70.6 ng mL(-1), a LOD of 2.6 ng mL(-1) and a LOQ of 7.6 ng mL(-1). Except for cyromazine, no obvious cross-reactivity to common compounds was found. The data showed that the hapten synthesis was successful and the resultant antisera could be used in an immunoassay for the rapid and sensitive detection of this banned chemical.",M2
20380391,"Photocytotoxic lanthanum(III) and gadolinium(III) complexes of phenanthroline bases showing light-induced DNA cleavage activity.Lanthanide complexes of formulation [La(B)(2)(NO(3))(3)] (1-3) and [Gd(B)(2)(NO(3))(3)] (4-6), where B is a N,N-donor phenanthroline base, namely, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen in 1, 4), dipyrido[3,2-d:2',3'-f]quinoxaline (dpq in 2, 5) and dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine (dppz in 3, 6), have been prepared, characterized from physicochemical data, and their photoinduced DNA and protein cleavage activity studied. The photocytotoxicity of the dppz complexes 3 and 6 has been studied using HeLa cancer cells. The complexes exhibit ligand centered bands in the UV region. The dppz complexes show the lowest energy band at 380 nm in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The La(III) complexes are diamagnetic. The Gd(III) complexes (4-6) have magnetic moments that correspond to seven unpaired electrons. The complexes are 1:1 electrolytic in aqueous DMF. The dpq and dppz complexes in DMF show ligand-based reductions. The complexes display moderate binding propensity to calf thymus DNA giving binding constant values in the range of 5.7 x 10(4)-5.8 x 10(5) M(-1) with a relative order: 3, 6 (dppz) &gt; 2, 5 (dpq) &gt; 1, 4 (phen). The binding data suggest DNA surface and/or groove binding nature of the complexes. The complexes do not show any hydrolytic cleavage of plasmid supercoiled pUC19 DNA. The dpq and dppz complexes efficiently cleave SC DNA to its nicked circular form on exposure to UV-A light of 365 nm at nanomolar complex concentration. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and hydroxyl radical (HO*) as the cleavage active species. The complexes show binding propensity to bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) protein giving K(BSA) values of approximately 10(5) M(-1). The dppz complexes 3 and 6 show BSA protein cleavage activity in UV-A light of 365 nm. The dppz complexes 3 and 6 exhibit significant photocytotoxicity in HeLa cells giving respective IC(50) values of 341 nM and 573 nM in UV-A light of 365 nm for an exposure time of 15 min (IC(50) &gt; 100 microM in dark for both the complexes). Control experiments show significant dark and phototoxicity of the dppz base alone (IC(50) = 413 nM in light with 4 h incubation in dark and 11.6 microM in dark with 24 h incubation). A significant decrease in the dark toxicity of the dppz base is observed on binding to the lanthanide ions while retaining similar phototoxicity.",M2
20373820,"New insights into the behavior of bovine serum albumin adsorbed onto carbon nanotubes: comprehensive spectroscopic studies.Bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) nonspecifically binds to well-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), forming a stable bioconjugate. After accounting for the inner filter effect, we found the fluorescence intensity of BSA was quenched by MWCNTs in static mode, which was authenticated by lifetime measurements and Stern-Volmer calculations. The thermodynamic parameters DeltaG(o), DeltaS(o), and DeltaH(o) were -9.67 x 10(3) + 2.48 x 10(3) ln lambda J x mol(-1), 41.0 - 0.828 ln lambda J x mol(-1) x K(-1), and 7.30 x 10(3) + 2.23 x 10(3) ln lambda J x mol(-1) (lambda &lt; 1 x 10(-4)), respectively, which shows a spontaneous and electrostatic interaction. Scatchard analysis and UV-visible results provide statistical data concerning changes in the microenvironment of amide moieties in response to different doses of MWCNTs, revealing different behavior of the BSA molecules. The absorption spectra also show that the tertiary structure of the protein was partially destroyed. The content of secondary structure elements of BSA was changed by the tubes. This work elucidates the interaction mechanism of BSA and MWCNTs from a spectroscopic angle.",M2
20355198,"A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for bovine serum albumin assay in pharmaceutical dosage forms and protein/antigen delivery systems.Bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) is among the most widely used proteins in protein formulations as well as in the development of novel delivery systems as a typical model for therapeutic/diagnostic proteins and the new versions of vaccines. The development of reliable and easily available assay methods for quantitation of this protein would therefore play a crucial role in these types of studies. A simple gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-violet detection (HPLC-UV) method has been developed for quantitation of BSA in dosage forms and protein delivery systems. The method produced linear responses throughout the wide BSA concentration range of 1 to 100 micro g/mL. The average within-run and between-run variations of the method within the linear concentration range of BSA were 2.46% and 2.20%, respectively, with accuracies of 104.49% and 104.58% for within-run and between-run samples, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of the method were 0.5 and 1 microg/mL, respectively. The method showed acceptable system suitability indices, which enabled us to use it successfully during our particulate vaccine delivery research project.",M2
20349025,"Synthesis and biological activity of raltitrexed-carrier conjugates.Drugs used in chemotherapy give undesirable side effects, e.g., cardiotoxicity, leucopenia, hair loss and others. Covalent binding of a drug with a carrier may change its biodistribution, elimination and/or rate of transformation in the organism. The aim of this work was to synthesize conjugates of anticancer drug - raltitrexed (RTX) with lysozyme, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), and dextran T40 and to investigate their cytotoxicity and influence on the cell cycle in comparison with the free drug. Before conjugation RTX was transformed into anhydride by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dimethylformamide. Activated RTX was added into aqueous solution of carriers at different pH (from 8.5 to 10.5) for 3 to 15 min. The reaction was stopped by reducing the pH to 7.0. Maximum yield of the reaction was obtained at pH 10 for BSA as well as for dextran. The highest level of substitution was obtained after 5 min of the reaction. In in vitro experiments on three cell lines: SW707, LoVo and A549, all conjugates tested had up to a few hundred times higher IC(50) than the free drug. Interestingly, it was noticed that the conjugates based on dextran and albumin were more cytotoxic than the free drug in the highest concentrations tested (1000 and 10000 ng/ml). The influence of RTX and the conjugates on SW707 cell cycle was studied. RTX blocked the cell cycle mostly in the G(0)-G(1) and S phase and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Cells in the G(2)-M phase were not observed. The conjugates blocked the cell cycle in the S phase and decreased the percentage of cells in the G(0)-G(1) phase.",M2
20308015,"Influence of myristic acid on furosemide binding to bovine serum albumin. Comparison with furosemide-human serum albumin complex.Fluorescence studies on furosemide (FUR) binding to bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) showed the existence of three or four binding sites in the tertiary structure of the protein. Two of them are located in subdomain IIA, while the others in subdomains IB and/or IIIA. Furosemide binding in subdomain IB is postulated on the basis of run of Stern-Volmer plot indicating the existence of two populations of tryptophans involved in the interaction with FUR. In turn, the significant participation of tyrosil residues in complex formation leads to the consideration of the subdomain IIIA as furosemide low-affinity binding site. The effect of increasing concentration of fatty acid on FUR binding in all studied binding sites was also investigated and compared with the previous results obtained for human serum albumin (HSA). For BSA the lesser impact of fatty acid on affinity between drug and albumin was observed. This is probably a result of more significant role of tyrosines in the complex formation and different polarity of microenvironment of the fluorophores when compared HSA and BSA. The most distinct differences between FUR-BSA and FUR-HSA binding parameters are observed when third fatty acid molecule is bound with the protein and rotation of domains I and II occurs. However these structural changes mostly affect FUR low affinity binding sites.",M2
20307961,"Selective adsorption of small proteins on large-pore anion exchangers coated with medium size proteins.A new anion exchanger support has been designed for the selective adsorption of small proteins. This has been achieved activating an aminated support with glutaraldehyde and further coating the support surface with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). In this support,  wells  are generated by two neighborhoods BSA molecules, on the bottom of those  wells  glutaraldehyde groups are exposed out ready to react with small molecules that have a size small enough to be accommodated between two BSA molecules on the pre-existing support. However, the BSA surface was not inert enough adsorbing many proteins, thereby reducing the selectivity of the system. A further solution was coating the immobilized BSA molecules with dextran, reducing the adsorption of protein on the BSA surface. This new matrix has been evaluated in the selective adsorption of the very small beta-lactoglobulins and alpha-lactalbumin from dairy whey, achieving the selective adsorption of both small proteins while other larger proteins from dairy whey remained in the supernatant. Moreover, a protein crude extract has been offered to the new matrix, and only small proteins could be adsorbed on the support (as probed by gel filtration). Thus this amino-glutaraldehyde-BSA-dextran-Sepharose is a matrix that may be used to selectively ionically adsorb proteins that were smaller than BSA (62 kDa). This strategy may be used for any other kind of adsorbing groups (chelating agents, boronic acid, etc.), or using proteins with different sizes to coat the support, designing tailor-made supports that may permit the fractioning of proteins following their sizes and by adsorption/desorption on different matrices.",M2
20300739,"Quantification of nitrotyrosine in nitrated proteins.For kinetic studies of protein nitration reactions, we have developed a method for the quantification of nitrotyrosine residues in protein molecules by liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector of ultraviolet-visible absorption. Nitrated bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) and nitrated ovalbumin (OVA) were synthesized and used as standards for the determination of the protein nitration degree (ND), which is defined as the average number of nitrotyrosine residues divided by the total number of tyrosine residues in a protein molecule. The obtained calibration curves of the ratio of chromatographic peak areas of absorbance at 357 and at 280 nm vs. nitration degree are nearly the same for BSA and OVA (relative deviations &lt;5%). They are near-linear at low ND (&lt; 0.1) and can be described by a second-order polynomial fit up to ND=0.5 (R2&gt;0.99). A change of chromatographic column led to changes in absolute peak areas but not in the peak area ratios and related calibration functions, which confirms the robustness of the analytical method. First results of laboratory experiments confirm that the method is applicable for the investigation of the reaction kinetics of protein nitration. The main advantage over alternative methods is that nitration degrees can be efficiently determined without hydrolysis or digestion of the investigated protein molecules.",M2

20218695,"Comparison of surfactants used to prepare aqueous perfluoropentane emulsions for pharmaceutical applications.Perfluoropentane (PFP), a very hydrophobic, nontoxic, noncarcinogenic fluoroalkane, has generated much interest in biomedical applications, including occlusion therapy and controlled drug delivery. For most of these applications, the dispersion within aqueous media of a large quantity of PFP droplets of the proper size is critically important. Surprisingly, the interfacial tension of PFP against water in the presence of surfactants used to stabilize the emulsion has rarely, if ever, been measured. In this study, we report the interfacial tension of PFP in the presence of surfactants used in previous studies to produce emulsions for biomedical applications: polyethylene oxide-co-polylactic acid (PEO-PLA) and polyethylene oxide-co-poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PEO-PCL). Because both of these surfactants are uncharged diblock copolymers that rely on the mechanism of steric stabilization, we also investigate for comparison's sake the use of the small-molecule cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and the much larger protein surfactant bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>).

20210314,"Proteins as electronic materials: electron transport through solid-state protein monolayer junctions.Electron transfer (ET) through proteins, a fundamental element of many biochemical reactions, is studied intensively in aqueous solutions. Over the past decade, attempts were made to integrate proteins into solid-state junctions in order to study their electronic conductance properties. Most such studies to date were conducted with one or very few molecules in the junction, using scanning probe techniques. Here we present the high-yield, reproducible preparation of large-area monolayer junctions, assembled on a Si platform, of proteins of three different families: azurin (Az), a blue-copper ET protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a membrane protein-chromophore complex with a proton pumping function, and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). We achieve highly reproducible electrical current measurements with these three types of monolayers using appropriate top electrodes. Notably, the current-voltage (I-V) measurements on such junctions show relatively minor differences between Az and bR, even though the latter lacks any known ET function. Electron Transport (ETp) across both Az and bR is much more efficient than across BSA, but even for the latter the measured currents are higher than those through a monolayer of organic, C18 alkyl chains that is about half as wide, therefore suggesting transport mechanism(s) different from the often considered coherent mechanism. Our results show that the employed proteins maintain their conformation under these conditions. The relatively efficient ETp through these proteins opens up possibilities for using such biomolecules as current-carrying elements in solid-state electronic devices.",M2
20206002,"Spectrometric study of the interaction between alpinetin and bovine serum albumin using chemometrics approaches.The binding interaction of Alpinetin (APT) with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) was studied by fluorescence, UV-visible and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) under simulated physiological conditions. The measured complex spectra were resolved by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), yielding a host of data and information, which otherwise would have been impossible to obtain. The extracted profiles corresponded to the spectra of the single species in the APT/BSA mixture. In addition, the presence of the APT-BSA complex was demonstrated, and it was shown that the associated quenching of the fluorescence from the BSA protein resulted from the formation of APT-BSA complex via a static mechanism. The binding constant (K(a(ave))=2.34 x 10(6) L mol(-1)) and the number of sites (n=1) were obtained by fluorescence methods as were the thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH(0), DeltaS(0) and DeltaG(0)). This work suggested that the principal binding between APT to BSA was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions. The thermodynamic parameters for APT were compared to those from the structurally similar Chrysin and Wogonin molecules. It appeared that the entropy parameters were relatively more affected by the small structural changes. SFS from the interaction of BSA and APT showed that the ligand affected the conformation of BSA. The competitive interaction of APT and site makers with BSA indicated site I as the binding area of APT in BSA.",M2
20202894,"A comparison study on the interaction of hyperoside and bovine serum albumin with Tachiya model and Stern-Volmer equation.The interaction between hyperoside and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) was examined by fluorescence spectroscopy at 298, 304, and 310K. The spectroscopic data were analyzed using Tachiya model and Stern-Volmer equation to determine the binding sites and apparent binding constant between hyperoside and BSA. For Tachiya model, both binding sites and apparent binding constants increased with the increasing of temperature, whereas for Stern-Volmer equation, the corresponding binding constants decreased as temperature increasing and the binding sites were independent of temperature. The positive sign of enthalpy change (DeltaH) and entropy change (DeltaS) suggested that hydrophobic forces played a major role in the interaction. Synchronous fluorescence spectra indicated that the conformation of protein was perturbed by the interaction of hyperoside with BSA. Moreover, the presence of metal ion affected the hyperoside-BSA binding.",M2

The BSA fluorescence exhibits appreciable bathochromic shift along with a reduction in fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime upon binding with ligands. Ligand quenches the fluorescence of BSA in a concentration-dependent manner and deviates positively from the linear Stern-Volmer equation. The calculated quenching rate constants and binding constants were shown to depend entirely on the alkyl chain length of the ligands. After binding of probes with protein, the distance between the donor and acceptor was calculated using Forster theory. Ligands bind near Trp-134 in the subdomain IA of the native BSA and they become accessible to Trp-212 when BSA gets unfolded. The spectral data well supports the idea that BSA changes its three-dimensional conformation incrementally during its unfolding.",M2
20197057,"Misconceptions over Förster resonance energy transfer between proteins and ANS/bis-ANS: Direct excitation dominates dye fluorescence.Our aim was to disprove the widespread misconception that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the only explanation for observing fluorescence from ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid) and bis-ANS (4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt) following excitation at 280nm in the presence of protein. From ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra and fluorescence emission spectra of bis-ANS and ANS in buffer and ethanol, direct excitation at 280nm was found to be the dominant mechanism for the resulting dye fluorescence. Furthermore, Tyr/Trp quenching studies were performed for solutions of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide, heat-stressed immunoglobulin G (IgG), and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) by monitoring changes in steady state fluorescence spectra and time-resolved fluorescence decays as a function of dye concentration. Stronger quenching of the intrinsic BSA and IgG fluorescence in steady state than in time-resolved fluorescence by bis-ANS and ANS pointed toward static quenching being the dominant mechanism in addition to dynamic quenching and/or FRET. In conclusion, one should consider the role of direct excitation of ANS and bis-ANS at 280nm to ensure a proper interpretation of fluorescence signals resulting from dye-protein interactions. When ANS or bis-ANS is to be used for protein characterization, we recommend selectively exciting the dyes at the higher absorption wavelength maximum (370 or 385nm, respectively).",M2
20196188,"Pressure-assisted tryptic digestion using a syringe.A simple and effective digestion method was developed using a syringe. A 3 mL syringe was used to apply a pressure of 6 atm to expedite tryptic digestion. Application of a pressure of 6 atm during digestion resulted in better digestion efficiency than digestion under atmospheric pressure. The protein peaks in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra of three model proteins (cytochrome c, horse heart myoglobin, and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>)) completely disappeared within 30 min at 37 degrees C under a pressure of 6 atm, with greater numbers of peptides observed in 30 min pressure-assisted digestion than in overnight atmospheric pressure digestion. This is mostly due to the miscleaved peptides. Similar sequence coverages were obtained for 30 min pressure-assisted digestion and overnight atmospheric pressure digestion of the three model proteins (92% vs. 88% for cytochrome c, 100% vs. 97% for horse heart myoglobin, and 53% vs. 53% for BSA).",M2
20192264,"Protein-protein interactions in ovalbumin solutions studied by small-angle scattering: effect of ionic strength and the chemical nature of cations.The influence of ionic strength and of the chemical nature of cations on the protein-protein interactions in ovalbumin solution was studied using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS). The globular protein ovalbumin is found in dimeric form in solutions as suggested by SANS/SAXS experiments. Due to the negative charge of the proteins at neutral pH, the protein-protein interactions without any salt addition are dominated by electrostatic repulsion. A structure factor related to screened Coulombic interactions together with an ellipsoid form factor was used to fit the scattering intensity. A monovalent salt (NaCl) and a trivalent salt (YCl(3)) were used to study the effect of the chemical nature of cations on the interaction in protein solutions. Upon addition of NaCl, with ionic strength below that of physiological conditions (150 mM), the effective interactions are still dominated by the surface charge of the proteins and the scattering data can be understood using the same model. When yttrium chloride was used, a reentrant condensation behavior, i.e., aggregation and subsequent redissolution of proteins with increasing salt concentration, was observed. SAXS measurements reveal a transition from effective repulsion to attraction with increasing salt concentration. The solutions in the reentrant regime become unstable after long times (several days). The results are discussed and compared with those from bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) in solutions.",M2
20191556,"Protein adsorption-dependent electro-kinetic pore flow: modeling of ion-exchange electrochromatography with an oscillatory transverse electric field.Electro-kinetic acceleration of protein mass transfer was studied by dynamic chromatographic experiments and computer simulations on IEC with an oscillatory transverse electric field (EF) perpendicular to the mobile-phase flow (pIEEC). The breakthrough behavior of <e>BSA</e> was investigated at different electric current densities. A two-dimensional mathematical model has been established to describe the electro-kinetic convection-diffusion behavior of protein adsorption in a single adsorbent particle. The equation was coupled with the axial dispersion model to simulate the dynamic adsorption process in the pIEEC. The model parameters were determined by independent experiments or calculations. It was found that protein adsorption led to an exponential decrease of intraparticle electro-kinetic flow with increasing protein adsorption. Taking this effect into consideration, the model calculations could well describe dynamic breakthrough curves. Moreover, protein distribution in adsorbents was observed to present excursion along the periodical oscillatory EF direction. At the beginning of pIEEC, intraparticle convection caused by the EF contributed more to the enhancement of dynamic binding capacity. Finally, it was confirmed that both the EOF and electrophoresis contributed to the acceleration of mass transfer.",M2
20188903,"Preparation and characteristics of protein molecularly imprinted membranes on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes.A novel protein molecularly imprinted membrane (PMIM) was synthesized on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) through a surface molecular imprinting technique by using bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) as the template molecule, acrylamide (AAm) as the functional monomer, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (NNMBA) as the cross-linker and ammonium persulphate [(NH(4))(2)S(2)O(8)] as the initiator. The amounts of raw materials were optimized in this paper and the suitable amount is 0.1g of CNTs, 0.02 g of BSA, 0.24 g of AAm, 0.1g of MBA and 0.025 mg of (NH(4))(2)S(2)O(8). The selective recognition ability of PMIM/MWNTs was evaluated using adsorption experiments. Maximum adsorption capacity was 5.53 microg/mg PMIM/MWNTs and a saturation value was achieved at a BSA concentration of 0.2mg/mL. The selectivity adsorption experiments showed that the PMIM/MWNTs also had higher adsorption capacities for BSA than for such molecules, as HSA, HB, pepsin and HRP. The PMIM/MWNTs displayed a 2.6-fold increase in affinity to BSA compared to the nPMIM/MWNTs. The PMIM/MWNTs, on the other hand, did not exhibit any significant change in affinity to other molecules compared to the nPMIM/MWNTs. In the experiment, the characteristics of the PMIM/MWNTs were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and their configurations were observed using scanning electron microscopy.",M2
20181860,"Early embryonic blood cells collect antigens and induce immunotolerance in the hatched chicken.Earlier experimental data in our laboratory showed that introduction of an exogenous protein into early chicken embryonic blood leads to immunotolerance of hatched chicken to that protein. However, the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. In the present study, we show that the blood cells collecting circulating antigen might contribute to the establishment of immunotolerance. In this experiment, most of the chicken embryo blood cells took up injected fluorescein isothiocyanate-<e>BSA</e> at approximately embryonic d 3. At the same stage, 1 microL of embryo blood was taken out and incubated with BSA. After being loaded with BSA in vitro and washed, these cells were injected back into the original embryo. The BSA-specific lymphocytes were depleted in chickens whose early embryo cells had been loaded with BSA, as evidenced by a significant decrease in anti-BSA antibody after challenge with BSA when the chickens were 3 wk old. In addition, by direct injection of BSA to embryonic d 3 embryo blood, the hatched chickens had decreased amounts of anti-trinitrophenol antibody after the chickens were challenged with trinitrophenol-BSA, indicating that the helper function of BSA-specific T cells was impaired. In conclusion, these observations suggest that some early embryo blood cells possibly collect and store antigen for the establishment of self-tolerance before the maturation of B and T cells.",M2
20176104,"Deleterious effects of reactive aldehydes and glycated proteins on macrophage proteasomal function: possible links between diabetes and atherosclerosis.People with diabetes experience chronic hyperglycemia and are at a high risk of developing atherosclerosis and microvascular disease. Reactions of glucose, or aldehydes derived from glucose (e.g. methylglyoxal, glyoxal, or glycolaldehyde), with proteins result in glycation that ultimately yield advanced glycation end products (AGE). AGE are present at elevated levels in plasma and atherosclerotic lesions from people with diabetes, and previous in vitro studies have postulated that the presence of these materials is deleterious to cell function. This accumulation of AGE and glycated proteins within cells may arise from either increased formation and/or ineffective removal by cellular proteolytic systems, such as the proteasomes, the major multi-enzyme complex that removes proteins within cells. In this study it is shown that whilst high glucose concentrations fail to modify proteasome enzyme activities in J774A.1 macrophage-like cell extracts, reactive aldehydes enhanced proteasomal enzyme activities. In contrast <e>BSA</e>, pre-treated with high glucose for 8 weeks, inhibited both the chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities. BSA glycated using methylglyoxal or glycolaldehyde, also inhibited proteasomal activity though to differing extents. This suppression of proteasome activity by glycated proteins may result in further intracellular accumulation of glycated proteins with subsequent deleterious effects on cellular function.",M2
20175539,"Phospholipid encapsulated semiconducting polymer nanoparticles: their use in cell imaging and protein attachment.Semiconducting polymer nanospheres (SPNs) have been synthesized and encapsulated in phospholipid micelles by a solvent evaporation technique. Four different conjugated polymers were used, yielding aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles which emit across the visible spectrum. The synthesis was simple and easily reproducible, and the resultant nanoparticle solutions exhibited high colloidal stability. As these encapsulated SPNs do not contain any toxic materials and show favorable optical properties, they appear to be a promising imaging agent in biomedical and imaging applications. The SPNs were used in simple fluorescence imaging experiments and showed uptake in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and live HeLa cells. Carboxylic acid functionalized SPNs were also synthesized and conjugated to bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) by carbodiimide-mediated chemistry, a key step in the realization of targeted imaging using conjugated polymers.",M2
20175145,"Toxic effects of ethanol on bovine serum albumin.The toxic effects of ethanol on bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) were measured by resonance light scattering (RLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV), circular dichroism (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that ethanol had toxic effects on BSA, which led to protein denaturation and the effects increased with the ethanol dose. By means of RLS, BSA was found to aggregate in the presence of ethanol and particles smaller than 100 nm were observed from TEM. The fluorescence spectra showed that the intensity of the characteristic peak of BSA decreased and blue shifted, because of changes in the BSA skeleton structure, as well as alteration of the microenvironment of tryptophan (Trp) residues. The conformation changes of BSA were also shown by UV and CD spectrometry.",M2
20171645,"Modeling protein binding and elution over a chromatographic surface probed by surface plasmon resonance.Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy is used as a scaled-down, analytical, pseudo-chromatography tool for analyzing protein binding and elution over an ion-exchange surface under cyclic sorption conditions. A micrometric-scale adsorption surface was produced by immobilizing a typical ion exchange ligand--diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)--onto commercially available planar gold sensor chip surfaces pre-derivatized with a self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid with known density. An explicit mathematical formulation is provided for the deconvolution and interpretation of the SPR sensorgrams. An adsorption rate model is proposed to describe the SPR sensorgrams for bovine serum albumin, used here as model protein, when the DEAE surface is subjected to a cyclic series of binding and elution steps. Overall, we demonstrate that the adsorption rate model is capable of quantitatively describing <e>BSA</e> binding and elution for protein titers from dilute conditions up to overloaded conditions and a broad range of salt concentrations.",M2
20170253,"Characterisation of protein adsorption on different liquid crystal phthalocyaninethin films.Bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) protein adsorption on thin spun films of different metal octakishexylthiophthalocyanine [(C(6)S)(8)PcM, M=Cu, Ni] derivatives is investigated by using three independent spectroscopic measurements namely Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance imaging. Thermally induced molecular self-reorganisations in the phthalocyanine films are found to have produced the changes in the surface energy which, in turn, control protein adsorption. The amount of BSA adsorption on [(C(6)S)(8)PcNi] is more limited than that on [(C(6)S)(8)PcCu] and this observation is consistent with the results on the surface wettability obtained from the contact angle measurements. The shift from the plasmonic resonance wavelength because of the BSA adsorption was significantly larger for the heat-treated [(C(6)S)(8)PcCu] than as-deposited film. Similar measurements on the [(C(6)S)(8)PcNi] films showed a limited BSA adsorption. The results of surface plasmon resonance experiments are consistent with those obtained from Raman spectroscopic and ellipsometric techniques.",M2

20152984,"The facile synthesis of an aldehyde-containing graft copolymer membrane for covalent protein capture with retention of protein functionality.The immobilization of biomolecules onto an insoluble carrier surface has always been a subject of great interest to enhance their resistance to pH and temperature, which aids in an increased activity lifespan as well as easy reuse of the said biomolecules. However, traditional methods are only able to provide single-layer biomolecular binding and require multiple chemical reactions to prepare the final substrate before the immobilization can be carried out properly. Here we report a facile one-step chemical synthesis of a new aldehyde-bearing graft copolymer via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) for covalent protein capture in a multilayered approach to covalently capture bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) onto a polymeric membrane. The resultant protein-bound membrane illustrated the retention of BSA's stereoselective discrimination ability by binding to an excess of 2 mol of tryptophan/mol of BSA and demonstrated an enantioresolution of a 0.184 mM racemic tryptophan mixture with a time-averaged-separation factor of 2.9.",M2

20152444,"Serum-protein effects on the detection of the beta-blocker propranolol by ion-transfer voltammetry at a micro-ITIES array.In this work, the effect of the serum protein, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), on the detection of propranolol in artificial serum by ion-transfer voltammetry at an array of micro-interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (microITIES) is presented. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) were examined for the detection of low concentrations of propranolol. Both CV and DPV had an interference effect from BSA, manifested as lower currents in the presence of the protein. DPSV proved to be the most effective technique, enabling the detection of 0.05 microM propranolol in the presence of BSA. The DPSV method employed a preconditioning step as well as a preconcentration step followed by the analytical signal generation step. The latter was based on the back-transfer of the drug across the microITIES. The preconcentration step was crucial to prevention of the adverse effects of BSA on the voltammetric detection. These results demonstrate that serum-protein effects on drug detection at low concentrations can be eliminated by use of DPSV at arrays of microITIES. CVs of propranolol with increasing concentrations of BSA revealed the influence of the drug-protein binding interaction, with decreases in current but no change in transfer potential. Therapeutic concentrations of propranolol were detected, demonstrating the viability of this approach for bioanalytical investigations.",M2

20151708,"Development of a visible-light-sensitized europium complex for time-resolved fluorometric application.The time-resolved luminescence bioassay technique using luminescent lanthanide complexes as labels is a highly sensitive and widely used bioassay method for clinical diagnostics and biotechnology. A major drawback of the current technique is that the luminescent lanthanide labels require UV excitation (typically less than 360 nm), which can damage living biological systems and is holding back further development of time-resolved luminescence instruments. Herein we describe two approaches for preparing a visible-light-sensitized Eu(3+) complex in aqueous media for time-resolved fluorometric applications: a dissociation enhancement aqueous solution that can be excited by visible light for ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)-Eu(3+) detection and a visible-light-sensitized water-soluble Eu(3+) complex conjugated bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) for biolabeling and time-resolved luminescence bioimaging. In the first approach, a weakly acidic aqueous solution consisting of 4,4'-bis(1'',1'',1'',2'',2'',3'',3''-heptafluoro-4'',6''-hexanedion-6''-yl)-o-terphenyl (BHHT), 2-(N,N-diethylanilin-4-yl)-4,6-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (DPBT), and Triton X-100 was prepared. This solution shows a strong luminescence enhancement effect for EDTA-Eu(3+) with a wide excitation wavelength range from UV to visible light (a maximum at 387 nm) and a long luminescence lifetime (520 micros), to provide a novel dissociation enhancement solution for time-resolved luminescence detection of EDTA-Eu(3+). In the second approach, a ternary Eu(3+) complex, 4,4'-bis(1'',1'',1'',2'',2'',3'',3''-heptafluoro-4'',6''-hexanedion-6''-yl)-chlorosulfo-o-terphenyl (BHHCT)-Eu(3+)-DPBT, was covalently bound to BSA to form a water-soluble BSA-BHHCT-Eu(3+)-DPBT conjugate. This biocompatible conjugate is of the visible-light excitable feature in aqueous media with a wide excitation wavelength range from UV to visible light (a maximum at 387 nm), a long luminescence lifetime (460 micros), and a higher quantum yield (27%). The conjugate was successfully used for streptavidin (SA) labeling and time-resolved luminescence imaging detection of three environmental pathogens, Giardia lamblia , Cryptosporidium muris , and Cryptosporidium parvum , in water samples. Our strategy gives a general idea for designing a visible-light-sensitized Eu(3+) complex for time-resolved luminescence bioassay applications.",M2

FTIR, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the ligand binding mode, the binding constant, and the effects of complexation on BSA stability and conformation. Structural analysis showed that polyphenols bind BSA via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with the number of bound polyphenol (n) being 1.30 for resveratrol-BSA, 1.30 for genistein-BSA, and 1.0 for curcumin-BSA.

20148530,"Interaction of bovine serum albumin with cationic single chain+nonionic and cationic gemini+nonionic binary surfactant mixtures.The interaction of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2), Brij58, and their binary mixtures has been studied using tensiometry, spectrofluorometry, and circular dichroism at physiological pH and 25 degrees C. The tensiometric profiles of CTAB and C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2) in the presence of BSA exhibit a single break at a lower surfactant concentration termed as C(1) (concentration corresponding to saturation of the interface) compared to their critical micelle concentration (CMC) in the buffered solution. However, for Brij58, CTAB+Brij58, and C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2)+Brij58, two breaks were observed, first at the critical aggregation concentration (CAC), corresponding to onset of interaction with BSA and the second at C(1) corresponding to saturation of the interface. The interaction of CTAB+Brij58 and C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2)+Brij58 mixtures with the BSA solution is discussed in terms of competition between surfactant-surfactant and surfactant-BSA interactions. CTAB+Brij58 and C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2)+Brij58 mixtures show nonideality with respect to mixed micelle formation, which is reflected in their interaction with the BSA. The interaction of CTAB+Brij58 with BSA decreases with increase in the mole fraction of CTAB in the mixture, whereas in C(16)C(4)C(16)Br(2)+Brij58 the reverse is the case. The results of the present study may prove fruitful in optimizing the properties of surfactant-protein mixtures relevant for many formulations.",M2
20148516,"Introduction of 4-chloro-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid liquid matrices for high sensitivity UV-MALDI MS.Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a key ionization technique in mass spectrometry (MS) for the analysis of labile macromolecules. An important area of study and improvements in relation to MALDI and its application in high-sensitivity MS is that of matrix design and sample preparation. Recently, 4-chloro-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid (ClCCA) has been introduced as a new rationally designed matrix and reported to provide an improved analytical performance as demonstrated by an increase in sequence coverage of protein digests obtained by peptide mass mapping (PMM) (Jaskolla, T. W.; et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008, 105, 12200-12205). This new matrix shows the potential to be a superior alternative to the commonly used and highly successful alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). We have taken this design one step further by developing and optimizing an ionic liquid matrix (ILM) and liquid support matrix (LSM) using ClCCA as the principle chromophore and MALDI matrix compound. These new liquid matrices possess greater sample homogeneity and a simpler morphology. The data obtained from our studies show improved sequence coverage for <e>BSA</e> digests compared to the traditional CHCA crystalline matrix and for the ClCCA-containing ILM a similar performance to the ClCCA crystalline matrix down to 1 fmol of BSA digest prepared in a single MALDI sample droplet with current sensitivity levels in the attomole range.

20138631,"Studies on the conformational change of adsorbed <e>BSA</e> onto a moderately hydrophobic surface at different denaturant concentrations and surface coverages.This paper is aimed at investigating the conformational change of denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA) in combination with thermodynamic functions and their fractions, adsorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Microcalorimetric measurements of displacement adsorption enthalpies DeltaH of denatured BSA (by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)) adsorbed onto a moderately hydrophobic surface (PEG-600) from solutions were carried out. The contents of secondary structure elements of BSA in solutions and in the adsorbed state were determined by FTIR and the thermal stability of adsorbed BSA was measured by DSC. The adsorption thermodynamic functions DeltaH, DeltaS, DeltaG, and their fractions were calculated based on the thermodynamics of the stoichiometric displacement theory for adsorption (SDT-A) and adsorption isotherms. The results showed that the surface can provide energy to denatured BSA and make it gain a more ordered conformation with GuHCl concentration increment. At a given GuHCl concentration, although the ordered secondary structure of adsorbed BSA molecules decreased, their tertiary structure may be more perfect with surface coverage increment. The thermodynamic analysis of four subprocesses associated with adsorption also confirmed the increment of conformational gain.",M2
20131882,"Zn- and Mg-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles for controlled release of protein.Bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) protein incorporated with hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by an in situ precipitation process. 2 mol % Zn(2+) and Mg(2+) were used as dopants to synthesize Zn(2+)/Mg(2+)-doped HA-BSA NPs. In our study we used BSA as a model protein. The amount of BSA uptake by doped and undoped HA NPs and subsequent release of BSA from NPs were investigated. Zn-doped HA NPs showed the highest amount of BSA uptake, whereas the amount of BSA loaded in undoped HA NPs was the lowest. A two-stage BSA release profile from doped and undoped HA NPs was observed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.2 +/- 0.2. The initial burst release was due to the desorption of BSA from the HA surface. The later stage of slow release was controlled by the dissolution of BSA incorporated HA NPs. The BSA release rate from Zn-doped HA NPs was found to be the highest, whereas undoped HA NPs released BSA at the slowest rate. Our study showed that the protein release rate from HA NPs can be controlled by the addition of suitable dopants, and doped HA-based NP systems can be used in bone growth factor and drug release study.",M2

The Stern-Volmer quenching constants K(SV), the binding constants K(a), and the number of binding sites n at 298, 301 and 304 K were evaluated by molecular spectroscopic approaches. The values of enthalpy (-13.47 kJ mol(-1)) and entropy (78.39 J mol(-1)K(-1)) in the reaction indicated that RAC bound to BSA mainly by electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction. The site markers competitive experiments indicated that the binding of RAC to BSA primarily took place in site I. The spectra data matrix was further investigated with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), and the concentration profiles and the pure spectra for three species (BSA, RAC and RAC-BSA) existed in the kinetic interaction procedure, as well as the apparent equilibrium constants, were obtained.",M2
20126687,"The extraction of liquid, protein molecules and yeast cells from paper through surface acoustic wave atomization.Paper has been proposed as an inexpensive and versatile carrier for microfluidics devices with abilities well beyond simple capillary action for pregnancy tests and the like. Unlike standard microfluidics devices, extracting a fluid from the paper is a challenge and a drawback to its broader use. Here, we extract fluid from narrow paper strips using surface acoustic wave (SAW) irradiation that subsequently atomizes the extracted fluid into a monodisperse aerosol for use in mass spectroscopy, medical diagnostics, and drug delivery applications. Two protein molecules, ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), have been preserved in paper and then extracted using atomized mist through SAW excitation; protein electrophoresis shows there is less than 1% degradation of either protein molecule in this process. Finally, a solution of live yeast cells was infused into paper, which was subsequently dried for preservation then remoistened to extract the cells via SAW atomization, yielding live cells at the completion of the process. The successful preservation and extraction of fluids, proteins and yeast cells significantly expands the usefulness of paper in microfluidics.",M2
20121272,"Effects of modification of calcium hydroxyapatites by trivalent metal ions on the protein adsorption behavior.The effects of modification of calcium hydroxyapatites (Hap; Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) by trivalent metal ions (Al(III), La(III), and Fe(III)) on protein adsorption behavior were examined using bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>; isoelectric point (iep) = 4.7 and molecular mass (M(s)) = 67,200 Da). The Al(III)-, La(III)-, and Fe(III)-substituted Hap particles were prepared by the coprecipitation method with different atomic ratios, metal/(Ca + metal), abbreviated as X(metal). The particles precipitated at X(metal) = 0 (original-Hap) were rod-like and 10 x 36 nm2 in size. The short, rod-like original-Hap particles were elongated upon adding metal ions up to X(metal) = 0.10, and the extent of the particle growth was in the order of La(III) &lt; Al(III) &lt;&lt; Fe(III). The crystallinity of the materials was slightly lowered by increasing X(metal) for all systems. The adsorption isotherms of BSA onto the Al(III)-, La(III)-, and Fe(III)-substituted Hap particles showed the Langmuirian type. The saturated amounts of adsorbed BSA (n(s)(BSA)) values were strongly dependent on X(metal) in each system. The n(s)(BSA) values for the Fe(III)-substituted Hap system were increased with an increase in X(Fe) (X(metal) value of Hap particles substituted with Fe(III)); the n(s)(BSA) value obtained at X(Fe) = 0.10 was 2.7-fold more than that for the original-Hap particle, though those for the La(III) system were decreased to ca. 1/5. On the other hand, the n(s)(BSA) values for the Al(III) system were decreased with substitution of small amounts of Al(III), showing a minimum point at X(Al) = 0.01, but they were increased again at X(Al) over 0.03. Since the concentrations of hetero metal ions dissolved from the particles exhibited extremely low values, the possibility of binder effects of trivalent cations dissolved from the particle surface for adsorbing BSA to trivalent-ion-substituted Hap particles was excluded. The increase of n(s)(BSA) by an increase in X(Fe) was explained by elongation of mean particle length along with the production of surface hydroxo ions, such as Fe(OH)2+ or Fe(OH)2+, to induce the hydrogen bond between the Fe(III)-substituted Hap surface and BSA molecules, though the number of original C sites established by Ca(II) atoms was reduced. In the case of La(III)-substituted Hap particles, the number of original C sites established by Ca(II) atoms was reduced by La(III) substitution but the mean particle length remained almost constant. Furthermore, surface hydroxo La(III) groups were absent. Therefore, the reduction of n(s)(BSA) was explained by both the unaltered mean particle length and their low surface hydrophilicity. The change of n(s)(BSA) values by X(Al) resembled that of the mean particle length. These results implied that both the mean particle length and surface hydrophilicity of Al(III)-, La(III)-, and Fe(III)-substituted Hap particles are determining factors of the adsorption amounts of BSA.",M2
20121056,"Achieving highly effective non-biofouling performance for polypropylene membranes modified by UV-induced surface graft polymerization of two oppositely charged monomers.A major problem in membrane technology for applications such as wastewater treatment or desalination is often the loss of membrane permeability due to biofouling initiated from protein adsorption and biofilm formation on the membrane surface. In this study, we developed a relatively simple and yet versatile approach to prepare polypropylene (PP) membrane with highly effective non-biofouling performance. Copolymer brushes were grafted to the surface of PP membrane through UV-induced polymerization of two oppositely charged monomers, i.e., [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (TM) and 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SA), with varying TM:SA molar ratios. Surface analysis with scanning electron microscope (SEM) clearly showed the grafted copolymer brushes on the membrane surfaces and that with X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) revealed a similar TM:SA ratio of the grafted copolymer brushes to that of the monomer solution used for the polymerization. Water contact angle measurements indicated that the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces was remarkably improved by the grafting of the TM/SA copolymer brushes, with the lowest water contact angle of 27 degrees being achieved at the TM:SA ratio of around 1:1. Experiments for antiprotein adsorption with bovine serum album (<e>BSA</e>) and lysozyme (LYZ) and antibiofilm formation with Escherichia coli (E. coli) demonstrated a great dependence of the membrane performance on the TM:SA ratios of the grafted copolymer brushes. It was found that the characteristics of the surface charges of the membrane surfaces played a very important role in the non-biofouling performance, and the membrane surface with balanced positive and negative charges showed the best non-biofouling performance for the proteins and bacteria tested in this study.",M2
20117787,"Investigation of the mechanism of protein adsorption on ordered mesoporous silica using flow microcalorimetry.The adsorption of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) and lysozyme (LYS) on siliceous SBA-15 with 24 nm pores was studied using flow microcalorimetry; this is the first attempt to understand the thermodynamics of protein adsorption on SBA-15 using flow microcalorimetry. The adsorption mechanism is a strong function of protein structure. Exothermic events were observed when protein-surface interactions were attractive. Entropy-driven endothermic events were also observed in some cases, resulting from lateral protein-protein interactions and conformational changes in the adsorbed protein. The magnitudes of the enthalpies of adsorption for primary protein-surface interactions decrease with increased surface coverage, indicating the possibility of increased repulsion between adsorbed protein molecules. Secondary exothermic events were observed for BSA adsorption, presumably due to secondary adsorption made possible by conformational changes in the soft BSA protein. These secondary adsorption events were not observed for lysozyme, which is structurally robust. The results of this study emphasize the influence of solution conditions and protein structure on conformational changes of the adsorbed protein and the value of calorimetry in understanding protein-surface interactions.",M2
20116799,"Adsorption of serum albumin on silica--the influence of surface cleaning procedures.The objective of the investigation was to study how different surface cleaning procedures affect the subsequent adsorption of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) on silica. Ellipsometry was used to monitor the adsorbed amount and thickness of the protein films in situ at physiological buffer conditions. Plasma treatment was found to effectively reduce the amount of BSA on silica and on surfaces cleaned with hydrogen peroxide solutions (RCA method) adsorption was essentially absent. On clean silica surfaces the ellipsometric data furthermore suggest that a depletion zone is present at the surface where the BSA concentration is lower than in the bulk solution. Additional experiments showed that calcium did not promote the adsorption of BSA and that the adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) is essentially absent on clean silica surfaces in agreement with the results obtained for BSA. The presented work contributes to the general understanding of protein adsorption as well as provides information on how to control serum albumin adsorption on silica based biomedical devices.",M2
20116217,"Effect of spacer length of alkanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(dimethylcetylammonium bromide) gemini homologues on the interfacial and physicochemical properties of <e>BSA</e>.The interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with cationic gemini surfactants alkanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(dimethylcetylammonium bromide) (designated as C(16)C(s)C(16)Br(2), s=4, 5, and 6) and single chain surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) have been investigated with tensiometry, Rayleigh's scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism at physiological pH and 25 degrees C. The results of the multi-technique approach showed that the gemini surfactants interact more efficiently with the proteins than their conventional single chain counterparts and their efficiency increases with decrease in the length of the spacer. The saturation in interfacial tension occurred at a lower concentration in presence of BSA compared to CMC of the surfactants in absence of BSA and the concentration of gemini surfactants corresponding to interfacial saturation decreases with decrease in the spacer length. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy results revealed increase in unfolding of BSA with decrease in spacer length of gemini surfactants.",M2
20113787,"Inhibition of sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin.INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). The killing of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli by NaOCl in concentrations from 2% to 0.03% was measured in the presence of BSA in concentrations between 6.7% and 0.1%. METHODS: NaOCl, BSA, and microorganism suspensions were mixed, and, after 30 seconds, 6 minutes, and 30 minutes, samples were taken and NaOCl was inactivated by 5% sodium thiosulphate. The microbes were incubated in tryptic soy broth broth for up to 7 days for the detection of growth. RESULTS: All microorganisms were killed within 30 seconds by 0.03% NaOCl when BSA was not present. High concentrations of BSA significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl against the four species. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of sodium hypochlorite by BSA was directly dependent on their quantitative relationships. The result partly explains the poorer performance in vivo of NaOCl as compared to in vitro experiments.",M2
20113169,"Entrapment enhancement of peptide drugs in niosomes.The objective of this study was to enhance the entrapment of various charged peptide drugs [(bacitracin (BCT), insulin and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>)] in niosomes by modifying the vesicular charge compositions. Cationic, anionic and neutral niosomes were prepared from sorbitan monostearate (Span 60) or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 61), cholesterol (CHL), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) and/or dicetyl phosphate (DP) in distilled water, by freeze dried empty liposome (FDEL) method. Morphology and vesicular sizes of the vesicles were investigated by optical microscope, TEM, X-ray diffractometry and dynamic light scattering. The entrapment efficiency of the peptides in niosomes was determined by gel electrophoresis and gel documentation. After reconstitution of the empty niosomal powder in phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing the peptide drugs, they were oligolamellar membrane structure, with the sizes of 40-60 nm, except the neutral niosomes entrapped with insulin and cationic niosomes entrapped with BSA which showed the sizes of 0.1-1.3 microm and 100-150 nm, respectively. The zeta potential values of neutral, cationic and anionic niosomes entrapped with BSA, insulin and BCT were -22.3 +/- 1.52, -30.7 +/- 2.92 and +22.68+/- 1.31 mV, respectively. The entrapment efficiency of BSA, BCT and insulin in neutral niosomes (Tween 61/CHL at 1 : 1 molar ratio) was 72.94, 69.89 and 10.26%, in cationic niosomes (Tween 61/CHL/DDAB at 1 : 1 : 0.05 molar ratio) was 84.54, 32.85 and 87.15% and in anionic niosomes (Tween 61/CHL/DP at 1 : 1 : 0.05 molar ratio) was 50.13, 90.88 and 44.31%, respectively. The highest entrapment efficiency of BSA, BCT and insulin at 72.94, 90.88 and 87.15 was observed in neutral, anionic and cationic niosomes, respectively. The results from this study has suggested the appropriate niosomal formulation to entrap the peptides with different charges and polarity for pharmaceutical application.",M2
20109544,"Cellular effects of peptide and protein hydroperoxides.Hydroperoxides are major products of the reactions of radicals and singlet oxygen with amino acids, peptides, and proteins. These species can generate radicals in the presence of metal ions and oxidize thiols via nonradical reactions, but the effects of these materials on cells are poorly understood. In this study the exposure of murine macrophage-like cells to preformed peptide or protein hydroperoxides is shown to result in hydroperoxide consumption and cellular thiol oxidation; these effects precede loss of cell viability. N-acetyltryptophan methyl ester hydroperoxides, but not the decomposed species, decreased total cellular thiols and GSH, with the latter occurring more rapidly. Time-dependent inhibition of lysosomal cathepsins B and L was also observed, together with diminished caspase 3/7 activity. A number of other cytosolic thiol- and non-thiol-dependent enzymes were not affected significantly. Hydroperoxides formed on <e>BSA</e> did not deplete total thiols or GSH within cells, although such reactions are rapid in model systems. In contrast, selective inhibition of cathepsins B and L (but not cathepsin D or arylsulfatase) of the endosomal-lysosomal system was detected, consistent with localization within these compartments. Decomposed BSA hydroperoxides did not induce these effects, indicating a requirement for the hydroperoxide group. The differences between these hydroperoxides are ascribed to their mechanisms of penetration into cells. Overall these studies provide valuable data on the initial cellular events arising from exposure to exogenous protein and amino acid peroxides and indicate that cellular thiols are a major target. This selective oxidation may modulate cellular redox balance and subsequent cell behavior.",M2
20105527,"Effect of milking frequency on lactation persistency and mammary gland remodeling in mid-lactation cows.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of milking frequency on milk production and composition, mammary cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. For this investigation, 10 Holstein cows that were being milked twice a day in mid lactation were selected. To study the effect of differential milking, 2 quarters were milked once daily and the other 2 were milked thrice daily for 8wk. After that period, twice-daily milking was resumed for all quarters, and data were collected for an additional 6wk. Mammary gland biopsies were taken 1wk before differential milking (wk -1) and after 4 and 8wk of differential milking. Milk samples were collected weekly throughout the experiment. Once-daily milking resulted in an immediate reduction in milk yield, whereas thrice-daily milking resulted in an increase in milk yield. During differential milking, the daily milk yield of the quarters milked once daily declined by 0.54kg/wk, on average, but remained constant in the quarters milked thrice daily. Part of the difference in milk yield between the glands pairs persisted after twice-daily milking was reinitiated. In the quarters milked once daily, milk <e>BSA</e> concentration increased, indicating an increase in tight junction leakiness, and zymographic analysis of milk enzymes showed increased activity of several proteases. Reducing the milking frequency also increased mammary cell apoptosis and, surprisingly, mammary cell proliferation. Interestingly, milk concentrations of stanniocalcin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I and mammary gland expression of several genes were also modulated by milking frequency. For example, expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor was downregulated during once-daily milking. Last, expression of the short and long isoforms of the prolactin receptor and of CSN2 (beta-casein) were upregulated during thrice-daily milking. Taken together, these data suggest that milking frequency not only affects mammary gland remodeling and the expression of paracrine factors but also modulates hormone sensitivity.",M2
20104921,"Anti-nonspecific protein adsorption properties of biomimetic glycocalyx-like glycopolymer layers: effects of glycopolymer chain density and protein size.In many cases, biomaterials surfaces are desired to be resistant to protein adsorption. A system fulfilling this task in nature is the so-called glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is an outer layer on the cell membrane with bound glycoproteins and glycolipids, exposing a pattern of carbohydrate groups. There is a growing interest to mimic this glycocalyx layer to have a tool to overcome the problems with uncontrolled protein adsorption on biomaterials. In this work a glycocalyx-like layer is artificially imitated by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of a glycomonomer, D-gluconamidoethyl methacrylate (GAMA), from a mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of an ATRP initiator-immobilized hydroxyl-terminated thiol and a methyl-terminated thiol as diluent. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/IR-ATR), contact angle, and ellipsometry measurements were employed to confirm the grafting of the glycopolymer. The anti-nonspecific protein binding properties of this glycopolymer layer were then investigated with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Three proteins with different size, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), and fibrinogen were used as model solutes to investigate the influence of protein size on the protein resistance behavior. The glycopolymer chain density was controlled during surface-initiated ATRP by varying the ratio of the components in the mixed SAM, and the chain length was adjusted by ATRP time. The effect of chain density in combination with the protein size was also evaluated. The most important results are that poly(GAMA) layers of higher grafting density show resistance to adsorption of the model proteins used in this work and that the amount of adsorbed protein depends on the length and density of the glycopolymer chains and also on the size of the proteins.",M2
20103983,"Interaction of guanidine-type surfactants with biological substances.The interaction of guanidine-type cationic surfactants with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) and liposome were investigated. Dodecylguanidine hydrochloride (C(12)A(0)G) and several dodecanoylamide alkylguanidine hydrochlorides (C(12)A(m)G, m = 2, 3, 4, 6) were used as the guanidine-type surfactants. In the interaction of these surfactants with BSA as a model protein, the binding isotherms of the surfactants to BSA were analysed. The structural change of the protein was also examined on the basis of circular dichroism and UV absobance data. In the interaction of these surfactants with liposome as a lipid bilayer model, we studied the effects of the surfactants on the solubilisation of liposomes and the release of carboxyfluorescein from liposomes. In addition, the effect of the surfactant molecular structure on the skin irritation was evaluated in connection with the interactions of the surfactants with BSA and liposome. It was found that small amounts of binding of C(12)A(0)G caused both a partial destruction of a-helix and an aggregation of BSA. C(12)A(0)G also induced the aggregation of liposomes, whereas C(12)A(m)G showed no such action. The presence of A(m) group in C(12)A(m)G appeared to reduce the skin irritation in parallel with the weakening of the interaction of the guanidine group with the protein and the lipid bilayer.",M2
20097277,"Freeze-drying of proteins with glass-forming oligosaccharide-derived sugar alcohols.Physical properties and protein-stabilizing effects of sugar alcohols in frozen aqueous solutions and freeze-dried solids were studied. Various frozen sugar alcohol solutions showed a glass transition of the maximally freeze-concentrated phase at temperatures (T(g)'s) that depended largely on the solute molecular weights. Some oligosaccharide-derived sugar alcohols (e.g., maltitol, lactitol, maltotriitol) formed glass-state amorphous cake-structure freeze-dried solids. Microscopic observation of frozen maltitol and lactitol solutions under vacuum (FDM) indicated onset of physical collapse at temperatures (T(c)) several degrees higher than their T(g)'s. Freeze-drying of pentitols (e.g., xylitol) and hexitols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol) resulted in collapsed or crystallized solids. The glass-forming sugar alcohols prevented activity loss of a model protein (LDH: lactate dehydrogenase) during freeze-drying and subsequent storage at 50 degrees C. They also protected bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) from lyophilization-induced secondary structure perturbation. The glass-forming sugar alcohols showed lower susceptibility to Maillard reaction with co-lyophilized L-lysine compared to reducing and non-reducing disaccharides during storage at elevated temperature. Application of the oligosaccharide-derived sugar alcohols as alternative stabilizers in lyophilized protein formulations was discussed.",M2
20097167,"Molecular mechanism of polyethylene glycol mediated stabilization of protein.The effect of different molar ratios of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the conformational stability of protein, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), was studied. The binding of PEG with BSA was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy by measuring the fluorescence intensity after displacement of PEG with chromophore ANS and had further been confirmed by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues of BSA. Co-lyophilization of BSA with PEG at optimum BSA:PEG molar ratio led to the formation of the stable protein particles. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy study suggested that a conformational change had occurred in the protein after PEG interaction and demonstrated the highest stability of protein at the optimum BSA:PEG molar ratio of 1:0.75. Additional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study suggested strong binding of PEG to protein leading to thermal stability at optimum molar ratio. Molecular mechanism operating behind the polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated stabilization of the protein suggested that strong physical adsorption of PEG on the hydrophobic core of the protein (BSA) along with surface adsorption led to the stability of protein.",M2
20085727,"The importance of protein-protein interactions on the pH-induced conformational changes of bovine serum albumin: a small-angle X-ray scattering study.The combined effects of concentration and pH on the conformational states of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) are investigated by small-angle x-ray scattering. Serum albumins, at physiological conditions, are found at concentrations of approximately 35-45 mg/mL (42 mg/mL in the case of humans). In this work, BSA at three different concentrations (10, 25, and 50 mg/mL) and pH values (2.0-9.0) have been studied. Data were analyzed by means of the Global Fitting procedure, with the protein form factor calculated from human serum albumin (HSA) crystallographic structure and the interference function described, considering repulsive and attractive interaction potentials within a random phase approximation. Small-angle x-ray scattering data show that BSA maintains its native state from pH 4.0 up to 9.0 at all investigated concentrations. A pH-dependence of the absolute net protein charge is shown and the charge number per BSA is quantified to 10(2), 8(1), 13(2), 20(2), and 26(2) for pH values 4.0, 5.4, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0, respectively. The attractive potential diminishes as BSA concentration increases. The coexistence of monomers and dimers is observed at 50 mg/mL and pH 5.4, near the BSA isoelectric point. Samples at pH 2.0 show a different behavior, because BSA overall shape changes as a function of concentration. At 10 mg/mL, BSA is partially unfolded and a strong repulsive protein-protein interaction occurs due to the high amount of exposed charge. At 25 and 50 mg/mL, BSA undergoes some re-folding, which likely results in a molten-globule state. This work concludes by confirming that the protein concentration plays an important role on the pH-unfolded BSA state, due to a delicate compromise between interaction forces and crowding effects.",M2
20085319,"Protein surface interactions probed by magnetic field effects on chemical reactions.Here we have employed the effects of weak static magnetic fields (not exceeding 46 mT) on radical recombination reactions to investigate protein-substrate interactions. Pulsed laser excitation of an aqueous solution of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS(2-)) and either hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) or bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) produces the triplet state of the radical pair (T)[AQDS(3-*) Trp(*)] by a photoinduced electron transfer reaction from tryptophan residues. Time-resolved absorption techniques were employed to study the recombination characteristics of these radical pairs at different static magnetic fields and ionic strengths. The experimental data in connection with the simulated curves unequivocally show that the radical pair has a lifetime of the order of microseconds in both systems (HEWL and BSA). However, the radical pair is embedded within a binding pocket of the BSA protein, while the (otherwise identical) radical pair, being subject to attractive Coulomb forces, resides on the protein surface in the HEWL system.",M2
20082774,"Immunoassay based on a polyclonal antibody for sex steroid hormones produced by a heterogeneous hapten-conjugated immunogen: estimation of its potentiality and antibody characteristics.A method in which antibodies are produced by using an immunogen heterogeneously conjugated with two or more kinds of haptens having unlike chemical structures against a same carrier protein was offered as an efficient approach for development of antibody to low molecular compounds. To appreciate the potentiality of the approach, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone were selected as model compounds. The I(50) values of antiserum developed were 6 and 8 microg L(-1) with the detection limits of 0.02 and 0.15 microg L(-1) for E2 and testosterone, respectively. Antiserum owned an interesting characteristic that it was possible to independently analyze E2 and testosterone without mutual interference by making proper use of coating antigens. When using beta-estradiol 17-hemisuccuinate (EH) conjugated with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) as a coating antigen, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was very selective to E2 and some estrogen analogues. Therefore, if testosterone coexisted in the ELISA for E2 detection, it showed no interference with it. From these findings, it was suggested that the verified method was an efficient and rational approach in development of polyclonal antibody to low molecular compounds.",M2
20075017,"A new acid mix enhances phosphopeptide enrichment on titanium- and zirconium dioxide for mapping of phosphorylation sites on protein complexes.The selective enrichment of phosphorylated peptides prior to reversed-phase separation and mass spectrometric detection significantly improves the analytical results in terms of higher number of detected phosphorylation sites and spectra of higher quality. Metal oxide chromatography (MOC) has been recently described for selective phosphopeptide enrichment (Pinkse et al., 2004; Larsen et al., 2005; Kweon and Hakansson, 2006; Cantin et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2007). In the present work we have tested the effect of a modified loading solvent containing a novel acid mix and optimized wash conditions on the efficiency of TiO(2)-based phosphopeptide enrichment in order to improve our previously published method (Mazanek et al., 2007). Applied to a test mixture of synthetic and <e>BSA</e>-derived peptides, the new method showed improved selectivity for phosphopeptides, whilst retaining a high recovery rate. Application of the new enrichment method to digested purified protein complexes resulted in the identification of a significantly higher number of phosphopeptides as compared to the previous method. Additionally, we have compared the performance of TiO(2) and ZrO(2) columns for the isolation and identification of phosphopeptides from purified protein complexes and found that for our test set, both media performed comparably well. In summary, our improved method is highly effective for the enrichment of phosphopeptides from purified protein complexes prior to mass spectrometry, and is suitable for large-scale phosphoproteomic projects that aim to elucidate phosphorylation-dependent cellular processes.",M2
20074539,"Qualitative and quantitative comparison of brand name and generic protein pharmaceuticals using isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry.The capability of iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification) reagents coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) as a qualitative and quantitative technique for the analysis of complicated protein pharmaceutical mixtures was evaluated. Mixtures of Somavert and Miacalcin with a small amount of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) as an impurity were analyzed. Both Somavert and Miacalcin were qualitatively identified, and BSA was detected at levels as low as 0.8mol%. Genotropin and Somavert were compared in a single experiment, and all of the distinct amino acid residues from the two proteins were readily identified. Four somatropin drug products (Genotropin, Norditropin, Jintropin, and Omnitrope) were compared using the iTRAQ/MALDI-MS method to determine the similarity between their primary structures and quantify the amount of protein in each product. All four product samples were well labeled and successfully compared when a filtration cleanup step preceded iTRAQ labeling. The quantitative accuracy of the iTRAQ method was evaluated. In all cases, the accuracy of experimentally determined protein ratios was higher than 90%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 10%. The iTRAQ and global internal standard technology (GIST) methods were compared, and the iTRAQ method provided both higher sequence coverage and enhanced signal intensity.",M2
20066692,"Microspheres of mixed proteins.This paper describes the synthesis of mixed proteinaceous microspheres (MPMs) by the sonochemical method. The current fundamental research follows the research of Suslick and co-workers who have developed a method by which high-intensity ultrasound is used to make aqueous suspensions of proteinaceous microcapsules filled with water-insoluble liquids.1 By using high-intensity ultrasound, we have synthesized microspheres made of a few different proteins. The three proteins used in the current experiments are bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cyan fluorescent protein-glucose binding protein-yellow fluorescent fused protein (CFP-GBP-YFP). The two synthesized microspheres made of mixed proteins are BSA-GFP and BSA-(CFP-GBP-YFP). This paper presents the characterization of the sonochemically produced microspheres of mixed proteins. It also provides an estimate of the efficiency of the sonochemical process in converting the native proteins to microspheres.",M2
20065522,"Direct analysis of reversed-phase high-performance thin layer chromatography separated tryptic protein digests using a liquid microjunction surface sampling probe/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry system.The sampling, ionization and detection of tryptic peptides separated in one-dimension on reversed-phase high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates was performed using liquid microjunction surface sampling probe electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Tryptic digests of five proteins [cytochrome c, myoglobin, beta-casein, lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>)] were spotted on reversed phase HPTLC RP-8 F254s and HPTLC RP-18 F254s plates. The plates were then developed using 70/30 methanol/water with 0.1M ammonium acetate. A dual purpose extraction/electrospray solution containing 70/30/0.1 water/methanol/formic acid was infused through the sampling probe during analysis of the developed lanes. Both full scan mass spectra and data dependent tandem mass spectra were acquired for each development lane to detect and verify the peptide distributions. Data dependent tandem mass spectra provided both protein identification and sequence coverage information. Highest sequence coverages were achieved for cytochrome c and myoglobin (62.5% and 58.3%, respectively) on reversed phase RP-8 plates. While the tryptic peptides were separated enough for identification, the peptide bands did show some overlap with most peptides located in the lower half of the development lane. Proteins whose peptides were more separated gave higher sequence coverage. Larger proteins such as beta-casein and BSA which were spotted in lower relative amounts gave much lower sequence coverage than the smaller proteins.",M2
20063997,"Characterization of a head-only aerosol exposure system for nonhuman primates.A well-characterized exposure chamber is necessary to generate reproducible atmospheres for inhalation toxicology studies. The aim of the present study was to characterize a head-only exposure chamber for non-human primates. Aerosols containing bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) were used to characterize a 16-L dynamic airflow head-only exposure chamber. A 250-ml plastic bottle with a respirator attached located inside the chamber was used to simulate a breathing head. Chamber leak rate, mixing, and aerosol spatial distributions were quantified. The chamber concentration profile was measured at the chamber exhaust using an aerodynamic particle sizer. Aerosol spatial distribution was determined by collecting filter samples at several chamber locations. The particle size distribution was determined by collecting cascade impactor samples at several chamber locations. The estimated chamber leak rate was within standards suggested in the literature. The measured average aerosol residence time was similar to theoretical aerosol residence time, suggesting that the chamber was mixing well. Additionally, the average concentration measured at each of the sampling locations within the chamber was similar, and the within-run coefficients of variation (CV) across all sampling locations was similar to those reported in previously published studies, again suggesting that the aerosol concentration throughout the chamber was uniform. The particle size distribution was similar throughout the exposure chamber. Additionally, the BSA concentration and particle size distributions measured in the breathing zone of the simulated head were not significantly different from measurements made elsewhere in the chamber, suggesting that respiration does not affect the average aerosol concentration or particle size distribution at the mouth.",M2
20060538,"Bioconjugation of 32-macrocyclic polyammonium cations-functionalized gold nanoparticles with <e>BSA</e>.Water-dispersed, spherical, underivatized Au-NPs with particle size less than 5 nm were synthesized from an aqueous solution of 32-macrocyclic polyammonium chloride, [32]ane-(NH(2)(+))(8).8Cl(-) (32-MCPAC) using sodium borohydride (NaBH(4)) as the reducing agent. The bioconjugation of the synthesized Au-NPs at different pHs (3.6-5.6) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein was studied using UV-Vis, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. These studies support that the Au-NPs were incorporated into the protein moiety and bound to it chemically. The binding constants (K(b)) and stoichiometries (n) (i.e., the number of Au-NPs bound by the proteins) of BSA protein to the Au-NPs at different pHs were determined by measuring the quenching of the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residues of the protein molecules after conjugation. The values for K(b) (n) were found to be 1.05 x 10(10) M(-1) (1.66), 2.09 x 10(10) M(-1) (2.30), and 1.86 x 10(10) M(-1) (1.75) at pH 3.60, 4.60, and 5.60 for BSA-Au-NPs conjugations, respectively. The results show that BSA binds to the Au-NPs strongly at pH 4.60, which is equivalent to its isoelectric point (pI 4.6).",M2
20060414,"2,2,2-Trifluroethanol induces simultaneous increase in alpha-helicity and aggregation in alkaline unfolded state of bovine serum albumin.Little work has been done to understand the folding of proteins at alkaline conditions. <e>BSA</e> acquires a partially reversible unfolded state at pH 13.0, devoid of any native structure. Introduction of methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol with the alkaline unfolded protein resulted in beta-sheet-like structure formation, and 2,2,2-trifluroethanol found to enhance alpha-helical conformations with simultaneous increase in aggregation. The extent of secondary and tertiary structure formation is in the order of methanol &lt; ethanol &lt; 2-propanol &lt; 2,2,2-trifluroethanol. Exposure of hydrophobic core of protein molecules in apolar environment of 2,2,2-trifluroethanol seems to promote intermolecular cluster formation. This is one of the very few reports that alpha-helical structures can also aggregate.",M2
20058085,"Active and biomimetic nanofilters for selective   protein separation.Selective protein channels in cell and nuclear membranes act as gateways to control the passage of molecules across. The selectivity of these channels stems from attractive potentials of the binding sites in the transmembrane proteins. These channels can filter out small volume of solutions with high precision. Motivated from this phenomenon, we report biomimetic facilitated transport modality to selectively separate a target molecule from a mixture of molecules. The attractive potential is generated by specific antibodies immobilized inside 15 nm diameter polycarbonate nanochannels. Two proteins with similar physicochemical properties (Bovine Serum Albumin 66 kDa, and Human Hemoglobin 65 kDa) are chosen as model molecules. The protein molecules are mixed in ratios of 1:1, 1:20 and 1:40 (Hb:<e>BSA</e>), and separation of molecules is demonstrated. The selectivity of membrane can be switched from Hb to BSA by changing the immobilized antibody inside the membrane channels. This approach can be used to selectively enrich any target molecule from a complex sample to enhance signal-to-noise ratio for early disease diagnosis.",M2
20056228,"Characterization of different conformations of bovine serum albumin and their propensity to aggregate in the presence of N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium bromide.To characterize the structural changes in bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) on the addition of N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and to understand the mechanism underlying aggregation of resulting protein-surfactant complex, UV-visible absorbance, steady-state fluorescence, SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and circular dichroism measurements of BSA-CTAB solutions were carried out. Changes in UV-visible absorbance and the fluorescence intensity on the addition of CTAB indicate the binding of CTAB to BSA. Changes in SDS-gel pattern of pepsin digested BSA sample, circular dichroism band at 222 nm, ANS intensity of BSA-ANS solution and hydrodynamic diameter of native state monomer on the addition of CTAB indicate that BSA unfolds in the presence of CTAB. Changes in the heme binding profile, temperature dependence of the heme binding profile and change from mixed to dynamic quenching in acrylamide quenching experiments of BSA solution on the addition of CTAB indicate that BSA unfolds to an intermediate. Turbidity and DLS measurements at 298 K, 323 K and 358 K indicate that the order of propensity to aggregate for different conformations of protein is: denatured &gt; intermediate &gt; native. The formation of aggregates is influenced by the nature of head and tail of the surfactant.",M2
20054435,"Optimization of the preparation process of vinblastine sulfate (VBLS)-loaded folate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) nanoparticles for tumor-targeted drug delivery using response surface methodology (RSM).Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process of preparing bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles by desolvation, then the resulting BSA nanoparticles (BSANPs) were conjugated with folate to produce a drug carrier system that can specifically target tumors. The anticancer drug, vinblastine sulfate (VBLS), was loaded to this tumor-specific drug carrier system for the purpose of overcoming the nonspecific targeting characteristics and side effects of the drug. A central composite design was applied for modeling the process, which was composed of four independent variables, namely BSA concentration, the rate of adding ethanol (ethanol rate), ethanol amount, and the degree of crosslinking. The mean particle size and residual amino groups of the BSANPs were chosen as response variables. The interactive effects of the four independent variables on the response variables were studied. The characteristics of the nanoparticles; such as amount of folate conjugation, drug entrapment efficiency, drug-loading efficiency, surface morphology and release kinetics in vitro were investigated. Optimum conditions for preparing desired BSANPs, with a mean particle size of 156.6 nm and residual amino groups of 668.973 nM/mg, were obtained. The resulting folate-conjugated BSANPs (FA-BSANPs) showed a drug entrapment efficiency of 84.83% and drug-loading efficiency of 42.37%, respectively, and the amount of folate conjugation was 383.996 microM/g BSANPs. The results of this study indicate that using FA-BSANPs as a drug carrier system could be effective in targeting VBLS-sensitive tumors in the future.",M2
20049884,"A microfluidic reactor for rapid, low-pressure proteolysis with on-chip electrospray ionization.A microfluidic reactor that enables rapid digestion of proteins prior to on-line analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is introduced. The device incorporates a wide (1.5 cm), shallow (10 microm) reactor 'well' that is functionalized with pepsin-agarose, a design that facilitates low-pressure operation and high clogging resistance. Electrospray ionization is carried out directly from a short metal capillary integrated into the chip outlet. Fabrication, involving laser ablation of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), is exceedingly straightforward and inexpensive. High sequence coverage spectra of myoglobin (Mb), ubiquitin (Ub) and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) digests were obtained after &lt;4 s of residence time in the reactor. Stress testing showed little loss of performance over approximately 2 h continuous use at high flow rates (30 microL/min).

20045181,"Targeting of the prostacyclin specific IP1 receptor in lungs with molecular conjugates comprising prostaglandin I2 analogues.Molecular conjugates comprising targeting ligands hold great promise for site-specific gene delivery to distant tumors and individual organs including the lung. Here we show that prostaglandin I2 analogues can be used to improve gene transfer efficiency of polyethylenimine (PEI) gene vectors on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro and lungs of mice in vivo. Prostacyclin (IP1) receptor expression was confirmed in pulmonary epithelial cell lines by western blot. Iloprost (ILO) and treprostinil (TRP), two prostaglandin I2 analogues, were conjugated to fluorescein-labeled <e>BSA</e> (FLUO-BSA) and compared for IP1 receptor binding/uptake in different lung cell lines. Binding of FLUO-BSA-ILO was 2-4-fold higher than for FLUO-BSA-TRP and could be specifically inhibited by free ILO and IP1 receptor antagonist CAY10449. Internalization of FLUO-BSA-ILO was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Molecular conjugates of PEI and ILO (PEI-g-ILO) were synthesized with increasing coupling degree (F(ILO) (ILO:PEI) = 2, 5, 8, 16) and analyzed for DNA binding, particle formation and transfection efficiency. At optimized conditions (N/P 4, F(ILO) = 5), gene expression using PEI-g-ILO was significantly up to 46-fold higher than for PEI gene vectors and specifically inhibited by CAY10449. Gene expression in the lungs of mice after aerosol delivery was 14-fold higher with PEI-g-ILO F(ILO) = 5 than for PEI. We suggest that targeting of IP1 receptor using ILO represents a promising approach to improve pulmonary gene transfer.",M2
20045113,"Preparation and characterization of novel macroporous cellulose beads regenerated from ionic liquid for fast chromatography.Macroporous cellulose beads (MCB) used as anion exchangers were successfully prepared from cellulose solution in ionic liquid by double emulsification followed by cross-linking and modification with diethylaminoethyl. The pore structure and properties of the MCB were investigated and the results were compared with homogeneous cellulose beads (HCB). The MCB in size of about 71 microm is characterized by two sets of pores, i.e., diffusion pores (10-20 nm) and macropores (800-2000 nm), determined by mercury porosimeter. In addition, the bed permeability and effective porosity for <e>BSA</e> of MCB-packed column are 58% and 25% higher than those of HCB-packed column, respectively. The adsorption properties of MCB were evaluated, and compared with HCB and commercial absorbent (Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, CSFF). It is found that the pore diffusivity of BSA in MCB is over 7.9 times higher than HCB, and 6.7 times higher than CSFF, respectively. While the equilibrium adsorption capacity (q(m)) of BSA on MCB is obviously lower than that on HCB and CSFF, the dynamic binding capacity (DBC) on MCB at 10% breakthrough reaches 47.7 mg/mL, higher than HCB (40.3mg/mL) and CSFF (46.2mg/mL) at flow rate of 360 cm/h. In addition, the MCB-packed column showed better column efficiency over the HCB packed one. Therefore, we demonstrated that the MCB possessed more advantages than other ones, like HCB and CSFF, and was expected as an ideal material for fast chromatography.",M2
20045044,"Iontophoretic transport of charged macromolecules across human sclera.The mechanisms of transscleral iontophoresis have been investigated previously with small molecules in rabbit sclera. The objective of the present study was to examine transscleral iontophoretic transport of charged macromolecules across excised human sclera. Passive and 2mA iontophoretic transport experiments were conducted in side-by-side diffusion cells with human sclera. The effects of iontophoresis upon transscleral transport of model permeants bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) as well as a model drug bevacizumab (BEV) were determined. Passive and iontophoretic transport experiments of tetraethylammonium (TEA) and salicylic acid (SA) and passive transport experiments of the macromolecules served as the controls. The results of iontophoresis enhanced transport of TEA and SA across human sclera were consistent with those in a previous rabbit sclera study. For the iontophoretic transport of macromolecules BSA and BEV, higher iontophoretic fluxes were observed in anodal iontophoresis as compared to passive and cathodal iontophoresis. This suggests the importance of electroosmosis. For the polyelectrolyte PSS, higher iontophoretic flux was observed in cathodal iontophoresis compared to anodal iontophoresis. Both electroosmosis and electrophoresis affected iontophoretic fluxes of the macromolecules; the relative contributions of electroosmosis and electrophoresis were a function of molecular size and charge of the macromolecules.",M2
20045013,"Biomarkers of acute respiratory allergen exposure: screening for sensitization potential.Effective hazard screening will require the development of high-throughput or in vitro assays for the identification of potential sensitizers. The goal of this preliminary study was to identify potential biomarkers that differentiate the response to allergens vs non-allergens following an acute exposure in naïve individuals. Female BALB/c mice received a single intratracheal aspiration exposure to Metarhizium anisopliae crude antigen (MACA) or bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) or HBSS alone. Mice were terminated after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was evaluated to determine total and differential cellularity, total protein concentration and LDH activity. RNA was isolated from lung tissue for microarray analysis and qRT-PCR. MACA administration induced a rapid increase in BALF neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and total protein compared to BSA or HBSS. Microarray analysis demonstrated differential expression of genes involved in cytokine production, signaling, inflammatory cell recruitment, adhesion and activation in 3 and 12 h MACA-treated samples compared to BSA or HBSS. Further analyses allowed identification of approximately 100 candidate biomarker genes. Eleven genes were selected for further assessment by qRT-PCR. Of these, 6 demonstrated persistently increased expression (Ccl17, Ccl22, Ccl7, Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Saa1), while C3ar1 increased from 6-24 h. In conclusion, a single respiratory exposure of mice to an allergenic mold extract induces an inflammatory response which is distinct in phenotype and gene transcription from the response to a control protein. Further validation of these biomarkers with additional allergens and irritants is needed. These biomarkers may facilitate improvements in screening methods.",M2

The photocytotoxicity of complex 3 has been studied using adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The phen complex 1, structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, shows the presence of a vanadyl group in six-coordinate VON(5) coordination geometry. The ligands L and phen display tridentate and bidentate N-donor chelating binding modes, respectively. The complexes exhibit a d-d band near 740 nm in 15% DMF-Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2). The phen and dpq complexes display an irreversible cathodic cyclic voltammetric response near -0.8 V in 20% DMF-Tris-HCl buffer having 0.1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. The dppz complex 3 exhibits a quasi-reversible voltammogram near -0.6 V (vs SCE) that is assignable to the V(IV)-V(III) couple. The complexes bind to calf thymus DNA giving binding constant values in the range of 6.6 x 10(4)-2.9 x 10(5) M(-1). The binding site size, thermal melting and viscosity binding data suggest DNA surface and/or groove binding nature of the complexes. The complexes show poor  chemical nuclease  activity in dark in the presence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid or hydrogen peroxide. The dpq and dppz complexes are efficient photocleavers of plasmid DNA in UV-A light of 365 nm via a mechanistic pathway that involves formation of both singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. The complexes show significant photocleavage of DNA in near-IR light (&gt;750 nm) via hydroxyl radical pathway. Among the three complexes, the dppz complex 3 shows significant <e>BSA</e> and lysozyme protein cleavage activity in UV-A light of 365 nm via hydroxyl radical pathway.

20036109,"Increased stability in plasma and enhanced cellular uptake of thermally denatured albumin-coated liposomes.Liposomes are nano-scale vesicles that can be used as one of drug carriers. The liposomes are, however, plagued by rapid opsonization of them and hence making their circulation time in bloodstream to be shortened. In this study, cationically charged liposomes of which surface was modified with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) were prepared by using electrostatic interaction between cationic liposomes and anionically charged BSA molecules at higher pH than isoelectric point (pI) of BSA. The BSA-coated liposomes (BLs) were denatured by thermal treatment of BL at 100 degrees C. The thermally denatured BSA-coated liposomes (DBLs) have mean particle diameter of 109+/-1 nm. Encapsulation of model drug, doxorubicin (DOX), in the liposomes was carried out by using, so called, remote loading method and loading efficiency of DOX in liposomes was about 90%. DBL800 showed higher stability in plasma compared to Doxil. Results of intracellular uptake evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies showed higher intracellular uptake of DBL800 than that of Doxil. Consequently, the DBL, of which surface was complexed with denatured protein may be applicable as drug delivery carriers for increasing stability in plasma and enhanced cellular uptake efficacy of anticancer drugs.",M2
20036089,"The impact of protein on Caco-2 permeability of low mass balance compounds for absorption projection and efflux substrate identification.This study was to evaluate the mechanistic effect of protein to help better interpret the permeability results for compounds with low mass balance in Caco-2 permeability assay. The absorptive or bi-directional permeability of lipophilic compounds with mass balance were measured across Caco-2 cell monolayers as well as the empty transport devices with or without protein (4% bovine serum albumin, <e>BSA</e>) added to the receiver side. The results from empty transport device study indicated that the filter membrane is a permeability barrier for the low mass balance compounds and protein increases permeability by improving the compound diffusivity through the filter membrane. Caco-2 permeability measured with protein provided better absorption projection. Assuming the amount of compound associated with cells as transported did not correlate with absorption. For efflux substrate identification using Caco-2 bi-directional permeability assay, protein at the receiver side had no significant effect on the conclusion regarding the tested compounds as efflux substrate but increased the permeability measurement from both transport directions. In conclusions, Caco-2 permeability results measured using protein-containing buffer at the receiver side for low mass balance compound seems to provide better correlation with in vivo absorption. The fact that protein at receiver side has minimal effect on efflux substrate identification provides scientific basis for further specific transporter characterization (such as P-gp or BCRP) using specific inhibitors, in which same concentration of inhibitor is used in both sides of the Caco-2 cell system and protein for optimal permeability assessment has to be avoided.",M2

Pharm. Pharmacol., 1972, 24, 790; Chinese Pharmacopoeia Ed. II, 1995). Herein, experiments were performed on: (1) synthesis of MMPA used as a novel mercuric hapten, (2) preparation of mercuric antigen of MMPA-<e>BSA</e>, (3) production of antibodies by rabbits immunized with the antigen, and (4) properties of the antibodies studied by ELISA. The results show that: (1) the antigen is safe for immunized animals; (2) high titer antibodies against MMPA are obtained implying good immunogenicity of the antigen; (3) antisera show slightly higher affinity to OVA-GHS-HgCl than OVA-GSH, indicating weak specific affinity of antisera against mercuric ion. Even the weak specific affinity, the hapten and its antigen have potential uses in immunoassays of mercuric ion in environment and food samples, because of easy chemical selective conversion from mercuric ion to MMPA and complete decomposition of un-reacted penicillin in acidic solution.",M2
20032614,"Sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate and Portland cement for furcal perforation repair: a protein leakage study.The purpose of this study was to compare the sealing ability of gray mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA), white MTA (WMTA), and both white and gray Portland cement as furcation perforation repair materials. A total of 120 human mandibular first molars were used. After root canal obturation and preparation of furcal perforations the specimens were randomly divided into four groups of 25 teeth each. In groups A, B, C, and D furcation perforations were filled with WMTA, GMTA, white Portland cement, and type II Portland cement, respectively. Ten teeth were used as positive controls with no filling materials in the perforations and 10 teeth with complete coverage with two layers of nail varnish were used as negative controls. A protein leakage model utilizing 22% bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) was used for evaluation. Leakage was noted when color conversion of the protein reagent was observed. The controls behaved as expected. Leakage was found in the samples from group A (WMTA), group B (GMTA), and in the two other groups (white and gray Portland cement). There were no statistically significant differences between GMTA and WMTA or white and gray Portland cement, but significant differences were observed between the MTA groups and the Portland cement groups. It was concluded that Portland cements have better sealing ability than MTA, and can be recommended for repair of furcation perforation if the present results are supported by other in vivo and in vitro studies.",M2
20029917,"Antithyroid drugs and their analogues protect against peroxynitrite-mediated protein tyrosine nitration--a mechanistic study.In this paper, the effect of some commonly used antithyroid drugs and their analogues on peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of proteins is described. The nitration of tyrosine residues in bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) and cytochrome c was studied by Western blot analysis. These studies reveal that the antithyroid drugs methimazole (MMI), 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), and 6-methyl-2-thiouracil (MTU), which contain thione moieties, significantly reduce the tyrosine nitration of both BSA and cytochrome c. While MMI exhibits good peroxynitrite (PN) scavenging activity, the thiouracil compounds PTU and MTU are slightly less effective than MMI. The S- and Se- methylated compounds show a weak inhibitory effect in the nitration of tyrosine, indicating that the presence of a thione or selone moiety is important for an efficient inhibition. Similarly, the replacement of N-H moiety in MMI by N-methyl or N-m-methoxybenzyl substituents dramatically reduces the antioxidant activity of the parent compound. Theoretical studies indicate that the substitution of N-H moiety by N-Me significantly increases the energy required for the oxidation of sulfur center by PN. However, such substitution in the selenium analogue of MMI increases the activity of parent compound. This is due to the facile oxidation of the selone moiety to the corresponding selenenic and seleninic acids. Unlike N,N'-disubstituted thiones, the corresponding selones efficiently scavenge PN, as they predominantly exist in their zwitterionic forms in which the selenium atom carries a large negative charge.",M2

20025991,"Scavenger receptors are associated with cellular interactions of S100A12 in vitro and in vivo.Increased plasma levels of S100 proteins and interaction of S100 proteins with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been associated with a number of disease states, including chronic inflammatory processes and atherosclerosis. However, data concerning the role of circulating S100 proteins in these pathologies in vivo are scarce and, furthermore, it is currently not known whether RAGE is the sole receptor for extracellular S100 proteins in vivo. We report a novel methodology using recombinant human S100 proteins radiolabelled with fluorine-18, particularly, (18)F-S100A12, in receptor binding studies and cellular association studies in vitro, and in dynamic small animal positron emission tomography (PET) studies in rats in vivo. Association to both human aortic endothelial cells and macrophages revealed specific binding of (18)F-S100A12 to RAGE, but, furthermore, provides evidence for interaction of (18)F-S100A12 to various scavenger receptors (SR). PET data showed temporary association of (18)F-S100A12 with tissues overexpressing RAGE (e.g., lung), and, moreover, accumulation of (18)F-S100A12 in tissues enriched in cells overexpressing SR (e.g., liver and spleen). Blockade of overall SR interaction by maleylated <e>BSA</e> (malBSA) clearly shows diminished in vivo association of (18)F-S100A12 to these tissues as well as a significant increment of the mean plasma residence time of (18)F-S100A12 (4.8+/-0.4 h vs. 2.3+/-0.3 h). The present approach first demonstrates that besides RAGE also scavenger receptors contribute to distribution, tissue association and elimination of circulating proinflammatory S100A12.",M2
20024189,"<e>BSA</e> activated CdTe quantum dot nanosensor for antimony ion detection.A novel fluorescent nanosensor for Sb(3+) determination was reported based on thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped CdTe quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles. It was the first antimony ion sensor using QD nanoparticles in a receptor-fluorophore system. The water-soluable TGA-capped CdTe QDs were prepared through a hydrothermal route, NaHTe was used as the Te precursor for CdTe QDs synthesis. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to TGA-capped CdTe via an amide link interacting with carboxyl of the TGA-capped CdTe. When antimony ion enters the BSA, the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen and oxygen atom become involved in the coordination, switching off the QD emission and a dramatic quenching of the fluorescence intensity results, allowing the detection of low concentrations of antimony ions. Using the operating principle, the antimony ion sensor based on QD nanoparticles showed a very good linearity in the range 0.10-22.0 microg L(-1), with the detection limit lower than 2.94 x 10(-8) g L(-1) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) 2.54% (n = 6). In a study of interferences, the antimony-sensitive TGA-QD-BSA sensor showed good selectivity. Therefore, a simple, fast, sensitive, and highly selective assay for antimony has been built. The presented method has been applied successfully to the determination of antimony in real water samples (n = 6) with satisfactory results.",M2

The compound forms spherical micelles in water with a cmc of 35 microM and a radius of 8.2 nm. The relaxivity of these aggregates is 31.2 s(-1) mM(-1) at 25 degrees C and 20 MHz, which corresponds to a molecular relaxivity of 125 s(-1) mM(-1). The high relaxivity mainly originates from the short tau(M) (72.7 ns) and the size of the micelles. The interaction with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) was studied and an observed relaxivity of up to 40.8 s(-1) mM(-1) (163.2 s(-1) mM(-1) per binding place) at 20 MHz and 37 degrees C was found in the presence of 2.0 mM protein.",M2
20023317,"Molecular-receptor-specific, non-toxic, near-infrared-emitting Au cluster-protein nanoconjugates for targeted cancer imaging.Molecular-receptor-targeted imaging of folate receptor positive oral carcinoma cells using folic-acid-conjugated fluorescent Au(25) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is reported. Highly fluorescent Au(25) clusters were synthesized by controlled reduction of Au(+) ions, stabilized in bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), using a green-chemical reducing agent, ascorbic acid (vitamin-C). For targeted-imaging-based detection of cancer cells, the clusters were conjugated with folic acid (FA) through amide linkage with the BSA shell. The bioconjugated clusters show excellent stability over a wide range of pH from 4 to 14 and fluorescence efficiency of approximately 5.7% at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), indicating effective protection of nanoclusters by serum albumin during the bioconjugation reaction and cell-cluster interaction. The nanoclusters were characterized for their physico-chemical properties, toxicity and cancer targeting efficacy in vitro. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests binding energies correlating to metal Au 4f(7/2) approximately 83.97 eV and Au 4f(5/2) approximately 87.768 eV. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of individual nanoclusters of size approximately 1 nm and protein cluster aggregates of size approximately 8 nm. Photoluminescence studies show bright fluorescence with peak maximum at approximately 674 nm with the spectral profile covering the near-infrared (NIR) region, making it possible to image clusters at the 700-800 nm emission window where the tissue absorption of light is minimum. The cell viability and reactive oxygen toxicity studies indicate the non-toxic nature of the Au clusters up to relatively higher concentrations of 500 microg ml(-1). Receptor-targeted cancer detection using Au clusters is demonstrated on FR(+ve) oral squamous cell carcinoma (KB) and breast adenocarcinoma cell MCF-7, where the FA-conjugated Au(25) clusters were found internalized in significantly higher concentrations compared to the negative control cell lines. This study demonstrates the potential of using non-toxic fluorescent Au nanoclusters for the targeted imaging of cancer.",M2
20022725,"Selection of an analytical method for evaluating bovine serum albumin concentrations in pharmaceutical polymeric formulations.Bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) is a commonly used model protein in the development of pharmaceutical formulations. In order to assay its release from various dosage forms, either the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay or a more specific size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) method are commonly employed. However, these can give erroneous results in the presence of some commonly used pharmaceutical excipients. We therefore investigated the ability of these methods to accurately determine BSA concentrations in pharmaceutical formulations that also contained various polymers and compared them with a new reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC technique. We found that the RP-HPLC technique was the most suitable method. It gave a linear response in the range of 0.5-100microg/ml with a correlation co-efficient of 0.9999, a limit of detection of 0.11microg/ml and quantification of 0.33microg/ml. The performed 't'-test for the estimated and theoretical concentrations indicated no significant difference between them providing the accuracy. Low % relative standard deviation values (0.8-1.39%) indicate the precision of the method. Furthermore, the method was used to quantify in vitro BSA release from polymeric freeze-dried formulations.",M2
20021248,"Nasal-associated lymphoid tissue is not an absolute requirement for the induction of rat tear IgA antibody responses.PURPOSE/AIM OF STUDY: The purpose of this work was to determine whether rat nasal-associated lymphoid tissue is required for the induction of tear IgA responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Particulate antigen in the form of DNP-<e>BSA</e> encapsulated in cationic microparticles was applied topically to the eyes (ocular topically) of rats that had the nasolacrimal ducts temporarily plugged with chromic gut suture material. Eye washes and serum were monitored for development of antigen specific IgA and IgG, respectively. To track the particulate uptake, fluorescent latex beads were applied topically to the eyes of plugged and unplugged animals. The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and the draining lymph nodes were then examined for the presence of the fluorescent beads. RESULTS: It was found that the chromic gut suture was effective in blocking the passage of antigen into the nasopharyngeal cavity for at least 24 hr. Tear antigen-specific IgA levels found in the eyes of plugged animals were not significantly lower from those of unplugged animals. Serum IgG antibody levels were also similar between the two groups. In animals with plugged nasolacrimal ducts, fluorescent beads were found predominately in the superficial cervical lymph nodes, which have been shown to drain the surface of the eye. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that particulate antigen can be taken up by the conjunctiva and transported to the draining lymph nodes, showing that antigen does not need to access nasal-associated lymphoid tissue to induce tear IgA antibody responses.",M2
20016877,"Study on elution behavior of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and their interaction with bovine serum albumin in asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation.Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have an amine surface and an ethylenediamine core and are of great interest in various applications such as in drug delivery. Physiochemical properties of PAMAM dendrimers vary with pH. At neutral to basic pH, PAMAM dendrimers are either weakly charged or uncharged and tend to adsorb on to the neutral packing material, making chromatographic separation of the dendrimers difficult. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) was tested as an alternative to the chromatographic techniques for separation of the PAMAM dendrimers. AsFlFFF provided generation-based separation of the dendrimers even at neutral and basic pH. The elution time increased gradually as the generation number (and thus the size) increased. Separation of impurities such as generational or missing-arm impurities and aggregates from the main population was also achieved. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (e.g., repulsive elecrostatic interaction among the dendrimer molecules or attractive hydrophobic interaction between the dendrimer molecules and the membrane) may result in an inaccurate size measurement. Careful optimization of experimental conditions such as the flow rate, pH, and the salt concentration may be required to minimize the interactions with the membrane. AsFlFFF was also tested for a study on the interaction between the PAMAM dendrimers and proteins. AsFlFFF was able to show the growth in the size of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) when BSA is mixed with increasing amounts of PAMAM dendrimers. Results suggest that, with proper optimization, AsFlFFF could become a useful tool for separation and characterization of large charged molecules such as PAMAM dendrimers.",M2
20013953,"Combining [13C6]-phenylisothiocyanate and the Edman degradation reaction: a possible breakthrough for absolute quantitative proteomics together with protein identification.This manuscript describes the results of a preliminary experiment performed as 'proof of concept' of a novel approach to absolute quantitation of proteins without the use of standard proteins. Absolute quantitation remains a challenging issue in the proteomics field. Therefore, we propose a combination of [(13)C(6)]-phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) and the Edman degradation reaction as a possible breakthrough. [(13)C(6)]-PITC was synthesized from [(13)C(6)]-aniline with O,O'-di-2-pyridyl thiocarbonate to prepare [(13)C(6)]-phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acids as internal standards. Upon the Edman degradation reaction, it has been confirmed that a model protein, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>), releases the N-terminal amino acid quantitatively as PTH-Asp. The standard curve of PTH-Asp against [(13)C(6)]-PTH-Asp showed good linearity (r(2) = 0.9977). BSA could be quantified as PTH-Asp using the standard curve. In addition, the residual des-Asp(1)-BSA provided sufficient information for further protein identification.",M2
20006932,"Assisted sonodynamic damage of bovine serum albumin by metronidazole under ultrasonic irradiation combined with photosensitive antitumor drug-Amsacrine.By research, it was found that the Amsacrine (AMSA) can interact with bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). In this work, the AMSA was adopted as a sonosensitizer and the Metronidazole (MET) was used as a sensitizer to further damage BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation. It could be concluded that the damage degree of BSA molecules in the presence of AMSA and MET was more serious than in the presence of pure AMSA. That is, MET could aggravate the damage to BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation combined with AMSA. Meanwhile, the damage degree of BSA molecules was also influenced by some factors, such as ultrasonic irradiation time, MET concentration and solution acidity. In addition, the damage site of BSA molecules was estimated by synchronous fluorescence spectra. It was found that the tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Typ) residues were damaged almost averagely. Perhaps, these research results are of great significance for driving sonodynamic method to treat tumor in clinic application.",M2
20005083,"Effect of surface area enhancement on the adsorption of Bovine Serum Albumin onto titanium dioxide.The equilibrium and the kinetics of <e>BSA</e> adsorption onto specific surface area changed TiO(2) by heat treatment were studied. The TiO(2) was treated at 100 and 200 degrees C for 24h. The specific surface areas of TiO(2) characterized by BET method were measured as 48.9m(2)/g and 53.0m(2)/g for 100 and 200 degrees C, respectively. The adsorption rate and the equilibrium experiments were carried out at pH 4 for 40 degrees C. The rate kinetics for the adsorption of BSA was best fitted with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The equilibrium process was described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The adsorption capacities (Q(0)) calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model were 40.6 and 44.4mg/g for heat-treated TiO(2) at 100 and 200 degrees C, respectively. The adsorption of BSA increased with increasing surface area of TiO(2). The zeta potential values of the 100- and 200 degrees C-treated TiO(2) were found as -2.57mV and 0.39mV, respectively, showing that the interaction between TiO(2) with BSA increased with increasing temperature of heat treatment for TiO(2).",M2
20004610,"Spectrometric studies on the interaction of fluoroquinolones and bovine serum albumin.The interaction between fluoroquinolones (FQs), ofloxacin and enrofloxacin, and bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) was investigated by fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the fluorescence quenching of BSA by FQ is a result of the formation of the FQ-BSA complex stabilized, in the main, by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant, K(SV), and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters, DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG, were estimated. The distance, r, between the donor, BSA, and the acceptor, FQ, was estimated from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The effect of FQ on the conformation of BSA was analyzed with the aid of UV-vis absorbance spectra and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectral analysis showed that the two FQs affected the conformation of the BSA but in a different manner. Thus, with ofloxacin, the polarity around the tryptophan residues decreased and the hydrophobicity increased, while for enrofloxacin, the opposite effect was observed.",M2
20003853,"Synthetic media for culture, freezing and vitrification of bovine embryos.Media designed for the recovery, holding and cryopreservation of bovine and equine embryos are available from several commercial sources. In years past, some of these media contained bovine serum, although inclusion of serum in embryo transfer media is now largely discontinued due to issues relating to storage and biosecurity. Currently, bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) is included in most commercially manufactured media intended for use in embryo transfer (ET). Although BSA poses less risk than serum for the transmission of infectious disease, its inclusion still entails risk of viral contamination. The present review briefly describes the various components of ET media and the development of efficacious ET media containing no products of animal origin. An evaluation of the efficacy of recovery, holding, slow controlled freezing and vitrification media in both research and commercial ET embryo transfer settings is also presented.",M2
20003578,"The effect of bovine embryo culture without proteins supplements until day 4 on transcription level of hyaluronan synthases, receptors and mtDNA content.The effect of bovine embryo culture on a flat surface, (without a surface-active compound) on the level of mRNA expression of hyaluronan (HA) synthases (Has1, Has2 and Has3), Ha receptors RHAMM and C44 receptors was evaluated by mitochondrial DNA concentration and in vitro development. Cultures were evaluated up to 96 h post-insemination (hpi) using SOFaa medium. Of the three Has isoforms, Has2 expression only increased in the bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>)-only supplemented groups regardless of time of BSA addition. Expression of RHAMM receptors was highly dependent on the addition of HA, irrespective of the presence of BSA in the medium. In contrast, expression of the CD44 receptor gene was not affected by any treatment. The cleavage rates and number of embryos that developed to &lt;or=8-cell stage by day 4 were not affected by lack of BSA in the medium, but increased numbers of blastocysts developed in medium supplemented with BSA from days 1 or 4 with or without HA than in medium that had HA only. Addition of both HA and BSA at day 4 increased mtDNA copy numbers at the blastocyst stage. Data suggest that the addition of BSA and/or HA at 96 hpi increased expression of RHAMM and Has2 genes, but not CD44, Has1 or Has3 genes. Higher expression levels of Has2 than Has1 and the three isoforms indicate that high- rather than low-molecular-weight HA should be used for preimplantation bovine embryo culture.",M2
20006741,"Thermal aggregation of glycated bovine serum albumin.Aggregation and glycation processes in proteins have a particular interest in medicine fields and in food technology. Serum albumins are model proteins which are able to self-assembly in aggregates and also sensitive to a non-enzymatic glycation in cases of diabetes. In this work, we firstly reported a study on the glycation and oxidation effects on the structure of bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>). The experimental approach is based on the study of conformational changes of BSA at secondary and tertiary structures by FTIR absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. Secondly, we analysed the thermal aggregation process on BSA glycated with different glucose concentrations. Additional information on the aggregation kinetics are obtained by light scattering measurements. The results show that glycation process affects the native structure of BSA. Then, the partial unfolding of the tertiary structure which accompanies the aggregation process is similar both in native and glycated BSA. In particular, the formation of aggregates is progressively inhibited with growing concentration of glucose incubated with BSA. These results bring new insights on how aggregation process is affected by modification of BSA induced by glycation.",M2
20006616,"Formulation of immunoassay calibrators in pasteurized albumin can significantly enhance their durability.Calibrator matrix can have significant effects on the commutability of assay standards and on the maintenance of their integrity. We have observed marked instability in progastrin-releasing peptide (proGRP) assay standards traceable to the bovine serum albumin (<e>BSA</e>) used in matrix formulation. Attempts were made to improve calibrator stability using different albumin pretreatments. Observed analyte recoveries in calibrators prepared with untreated BSA were consistently less than 45% after 1 week of storage at 4 degrees C. Pre-treating the BSA by chromatography on immobilized heparin or benzamidine failed to improve calibrator durability with day 7 recoveries of less than 55%. In marked contrast, calibrators formulated with albumin pasteurized at pH 3.0 displayed remarkable stability. Recoveries of &gt;97% were observed after 4 weeks of storage at either 4 degrees C or room temperature. Even calibrators incubated for 4 weeks at 37 degrees C gave recoveries between 91-106%. This improvement was not seen with BSA pasteurized at neutral pH. Albumin pretreatment is straightforward, easily scalable and dramatically improves calibrator stability. Matrix formulated with acid-pasteurized BSA may prove more generally useful when assays are plagued by poor calibrator durability.",M2
