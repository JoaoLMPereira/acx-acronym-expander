18976223,"Purification and characteristics of functional properties of soluble nucleoside triphosphatase (apyrase) from bovine brain.Soluble NTPase, differing in its properties from known proteins exhibiting NTPase activity, was purified from bovine brain to homogeneity. The enzyme has pH optimum at 7.5 and shows absolute dependence on bivalent cations and broad substrate specificity towards nucleoside-5 -tri- and -diphosphates, characteristics of apyrases. The NTPase follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the range of investigated substrate concentrations, the apparent K(m) values for UTP, <e>ITP</e>, GTP, CTP, CDP, and ATP being 86, 25, 41, 150, 500, and 260 microM, respectively. According to gel-filtration and SDS-PAGE data, the molecular mass of the enzyme is 60 kD. The NTPase is localized in the cytosol fraction and expressed in different bovine organs and tissues. Total NTPase activity of extracts of bovine organs and tissues decreases in the following order: liver &gt; heart &gt; skeletal muscle &gt; lung &gt; brain &gt; spleen &gt; kidney ~ small intestine. The enzyme activity can be regulated by acetyl-CoA, alpha-ketoglutarate, and fructose-1,6-diphosphate acting as activators in physiological concentrations, whereas propionate exhibits an inhibitory effect.",M1
17976651,"Molecular basis of the antimutagenic activity of the house-cleaning inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase RdgB from Escherichia coli.Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatases, which are ubiquitous house-cleaning enzymes, hydrolyze noncanonical nucleoside triphosphates (inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) and xanthosine triphosphate (XTP)) and prevent the incorporation of hypoxanthine or xanthine into nascent DNA or RNA. Here we present the 1.5-A-resolution crystal structure of the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase RdgB from Escherichia coli in a free state and in complex with a substrate (ITP+Ca(2+)) or a product (inosine monophosphate (IMP)). ITP binding to RdgB induced a large displacement of the alpha1 helix, closing the enzyme active site. This positions the conserved Lys13 close to the bridging oxygen between the alpha- and beta-phosphates of the substrate, weakening the P(alpha)-O bond. On the other side of the substrate, the conserved Asp69 is proposed to act as a base coordinating the catalytic water molecule. Our data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the substrate selectivity and catalysis of RdgB and other ITPases.",M1
17044594,"[Nucleoside-5'-triphosphate hydrolysis in the liver and kidney of rats with chronic alloxan diabetes]Activity and some properties of a soluble enzyme hydrolyzing nucleoside-5'-triphosphates were studied in the liver and kidney of normal and diabetic rats. The enzyme activity was shown to be reduced by 34% (p &lt; 0.01) in the liver extracts of diabetic animals, while no difference was observed in the kidney. When <e>ITP</e> was used as substrate, the apparent Michaelis constant of the enzyme was significantly lower in the liver of controls as compared to experimental rats (32.3 +/- 1.3 microM and 54.3 +/- 1.0 microM, respectively, p &lt; 0.01). The KM values of the enzyme in the kidney were not distinguishable in both groups. NTPase exhibits maximal activity at pH 7.0 and has a broad substrate specificity with respect to different nucleoside-5'-tri- and diphosphates. Molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 63.7 +/- 0.9 kD.",M1
16216582,"Identification of an ITPase/XTPase in Escherichia coli by structural and biochemical analysis.Inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) and xanthosine triphosphate (XTP) are formed upon deamination of ATP and GTP as a result of exposure to chemical mutagens and oxidative damage. Nucleic acid synthesis requires safeguard mechanisms to minimize undesired lethal incorporation of ITP and XTP. Here, we present the crystal structure of YjjX, a protein of hitherto unknown function. The three-dimensional fold of YjjX is similar to those of Mj0226 from Methanococcus janschii, which possesses nucleotidase activity, and of Maf from Bacillus subtilis, which can bind nucleotides. Biochemical analyses of YjjX revealed it to exhibit specific phosphatase activity for inosine and xanthosine triphosphates and have a possible interaction with elongation factor Tu. The enzymatic activity of YjjX as an inosine/xanthosine triphosphatase provides evidence for a plausible protection mechanism by clearing the noncanonical nucleotides from the cell during oxidative stress in E. coli.",M1
15951247,"Characterization of an ecto-ATPase activity in Cryptococcus neoformans.Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of pulmonary cryptococcosis and cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, which are major clinical manifestations in immunosuppressed patients. In the present study, a surface ATPase (ecto-ATPase) was identified in C. neoformans yeast cells. Intact yeasts hydrolyzed adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) at a rate of 29.36+/-3.36nmol Pi/hx10(8) cells. In the presence of 5 mM MgCl(2), this activity was enhanced around 70 times, and an apparent K(m) for Mg-ATP corresponding to 0.61mM was determined. Inhibitors of phosphatases, mitochondrial Mg(2+)-ATPases, V-ATPases, Na(+)-ATPases or P-ATPases had no effect on the cryptococcal ATPase, but extracellular impermeant compounds reduced enzyme activity in living cells. ATP was the best substrate for the cryptococcal ecto-enzyme, but it also efficiently hydrolyzed inosine 5'-triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>), cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP), guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP). In the presence of ATP, C. neoformans became less susceptible to the antifungal action of fluconazole. Our results are indicative of the occurrence of a C. neoformans ecto-ATPase that may have a role in fungal physiology.",M1
15655502,"Positive interaction of the beta2-agonist CHF 4226.01 with budesonide in the control of bronchoconstriction induced by acetaldehyde in the guinea-pigs.Pretreatment of anaesthetized guinea-pigs with either CHF 4226.01 (8-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[N-[(1R)-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl] carbostyril hydrochloride), formoterol or budesonide reduced acetaldehyde (AcCHO)-evoked responses in the lungs with a rank order of potency CHF 4226.01 (ED(50) values, from 1.88 to 3.31 pmol) &gt; formoterol (ED(50) values, from 3.03 to 5.51 pmol) &gt;&gt; budesonide (ED(50) values, from 335 to 458 nmol). The duration of action of CHF 4226.01 in antagonizing the airway obstruction elicited by AcCHO was also substantially longer than formoterol (area under the curve) at 10 pmol, 763+/-58 and 480+/-34, respectively; P&lt;0.01). Continuous infusion of a subthreshold dose of AcCHO enhanced the intratracheal pressure (<e>ITP</e>) increases caused by subsequent challenges with substance P (from 9.7+/-0.8 to 27.5+/-1.6 cm H(2)O as a peak, P&lt;0.001). Pretreatment with either CHF 4226.01 or formoterol prevented the sensitizing effect of AcCHO on substance P responses (ED(50) values, 2.85 and 6.11 pmol, respectively; P&lt;0.01). The ED(50) value of budesonide (396 nmol) in preventing AcCHO-evoked ITP increase was reduced when this glucocorticoid was combined with 0.1 pmol CHF 4226.01 (ED(50) 76 nmol; P&lt;0.001). CHF 4226.01/budesonide was two-fold more effective (P&lt;0.01) than the formoterol/budesonide combination. These results suggest that CHF 4226.01/budesonide, by optimizing each other's beneficial potential in the control of pulmonary changes caused by AcCHO in the guinea-pigs, may represent a new fixed combination in asthma.",M1
15280443,"Cloning, up-regulation, and mitogenic role of porcine P2Y2 receptor in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.Previous work has shown up-regulation of a UTP-sensitive P2Y receptor in porcine coronary smooth muscle cells (CSMC) of organ-cultured arteries. However, the molecular identity and functional role of this putative receptor remained undefined. Here we report the cloning of the cDNA for this receptor that encodes an open reading frame for a protein of 373 amino acids with the highest homology to the human P2Y(2) receptor (84%). Heterologous expression of this receptor in 1321N1 cells revealed a novel pharmacology in that UTP and <e>ITP</e> were full agonists and UTP was more potent and efficacious than ATP for increasing intracellular [Ca(2+)] and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Stimulation of subcultured CSMC with UTP, ITP, or ATP induced a concentration-dependent increase in cellular DNA content, protein synthesis, cell number, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, indicating a mitogenic role for P2Y(2) receptors. This was supported by the finding that the treatment of CSMC with antisense oligonucleotides to the cloned cDNA sequence significantly inhibited UTP- and ATP-induced DNA and protein synthesis. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that P2Y(2) receptor mRNA was dramatically increased in cells of organ-cultured arteries compared with freshly harvested arteries, whereas the P2Y(6) receptor mRNA level was unchanged, and the P2Y(4) receptor mRNA was undetectable. This P2Y(2) subtype-specific up-regulation was confirmed in cells of coronary arteries stented in vivo. In conclusion, we have cloned the porcine P2Y(2) receptor with novel pharmacology and demonstrated that this receptor is up-regulated in CSMC of in vitro organ cultures or in vivo stented coronary arteries to mediate the mitogenic effects of nucleotides.",M1
15167706,"Adverse drug reactions to azathioprine therapy are associated with polymorphism in the gene encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase).Adverse drug reactions to azathioprine (AZA), the pro-drug of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), occur in 15% to 28% of patients and the majority are not explained by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency. Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) deficiency results in the benign accumulation of the inosine nucleotide <e>ITP</e>. 6-MP is activated through a 6-thio-IMP intermediate and, in ITPase deficient patients, potentially toxic 6-thio-ITP is predicted to accumulate. The association between polymorphism in the ITPA gene and adverse drug reactions to AZA therapy was studied in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease. Sixty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease suffering adverse drug reactions to AZA therapy were genotyped for ITPA 94C&gt;A and IVS2 + 21A&gt;C polymorphisms, and TPMT*3A, *3C, *2 polymorphisms. Genotype frequencies were compared to a consecutive series of 68 controls treated with AZA for a minimum of 3 months without adverse effect. The ITPA 94C&gt;A deficiency-associated allele was significantly associated with adverse drug reactions [odds ratio (OR) 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-11.5, P = 0.0034]. Significant associations were found for flu-like symptoms (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-18.1, P = 0.0308), rash (OR 10.3, 95% CI 4.7-62.9, P = 0.0213) and pancreatitis (OR 6.2,CI 1.1-32.6, P = 0.0485). Overall, heterozygous TPMT genotypes did not predict adverse drug reactions but were significantly associated with a subgroup of patients experiencing nausea and vomiting as the predominant adverse reaction to AZA therapy (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.4-21.3, P = 0.0206). Polymorphism in the ITPA gene predicts AZA intolerance. Alternative immunosuppressive drugs, particularly 6-thioguanine, should be considered for AZA-intolerant patients with ITPase deficiency.",M1
12842880,"Three-strand exchange by the Escherichia coli RecA protein using <e>ITP</e> as a nucleotide cofactor: mechanistic parallels with the ATP-dependent reaction of the RecA protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae.The RecA protein from Escherichia coli promotes an ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction between a circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a homologous linear double-stranded (dsDNA). We have now found that under certain conditions, the RecA protein is also able to promote the three-strand exchange reaction using the structurally related nucleoside triphosphate, ITP, as the nucleotide cofactor. However, although both reactions are stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein, the ITP-dependent reaction differs from the ATP-dependent reaction in that it is observed only at low SSB protein concentrations, whereas the ATP-dependent reaction proceeds efficiently even at high SSB protein concentrations. Moreover, the circular ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein is strongly inhibited by SSB protein (suggesting that SSB protein displaces RecA protein from ssDNA when ITP is present), whereas the ATP hydrolysis activity is uninhibited even at high SSB protein concentrations (because RecA protein is resistant to displacement by SSB protein when ATP is present). These results suggest that SSB protein does not stimulate the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction presynaptically (by facilitating the binding of RecA protein to the circular ssDNA substrate) but may act postsynaptically (by binding to the displaced strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the linear dsDNA substrate). Interestingly, the mechanistic characteristics of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the E. coli RecA protein are similar to those of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the RecA protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae. These findings are discussed in terms of the relationship between the dynamic state of the RecA-ssDNA filament and the mechanism of the SSB protein-stimulated three-strand exchange reaction.",M1
12167477,"Distinct interactions of G(salpha-long), G(salpha-short), and G(alphaolf) with GTP, <e>ITP</e>, and XTP.The G(s)-proteins G(salpha-short) (G(salphaS)) and G(salpha-long) (G(salphaL)), and the olfactory G(s) protein (G(alphaolf)) mediate activation of adenylyl cyclase by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR). Early studies showed that the purine nucleotides GTP, ITP, and XTP differentially support receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation in various native membrane systems, but those findings have remained unexplained thus far. We systematically analyzed the effects of GTP, ITP, and XTP on the coupling of the beta(2)AR to G(salphaS), G(salphaL), and G(alphaolf), respectively, using fusion proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Fusion proteins ensure defined receptor/G-protein stoichiometry and efficient coupling. At all three fusion proteins, GTP, ITP, and XTP exhibited unique profiles with respect to their potency and efficacy at disrupting high-affinity agonist binding and supporting adenylyl cyclase activation by partial and full agonists. Our data can be interpreted in two ways: (i) GTP, ITP, and XTP may stabilize different active conformations in various G(s)-proteins, or (ii) GTP, ITP, and XTP may differ from one another in the kinetics of interaction with various G(s)-proteins. Regardless of which of the two explanations is correct, our present data demonstrate that GTP, ITP, and XTP are highly efficient regulators of signal transduction mediated through a specific G-protein. Also discussed is the possibility that G-protein activation by ITP and XTP may be of relevance in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a defect of the purine salvage pathway associated with abnormalities in various neurotransmitter systems.",M1
11976322,"Substrate regulation of calcium binding in Ca2+-ATPase molecules of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. II. Effect of CTP, GTP, <e>ITP</e>, and UTP.To examine the effect of CTP, GTP, ITP, and UTP on calcium binding of Ca2+-ATPase molecules of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the calcium dependence of the Ca2+-activated hydrolysis activities of these NTPs of the enzyme molecules was examined by comparison with that of calcium binding of the molecules in the absence of the NTPs at pH 7.40. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, CTP, GTP, and ITP did not affect the noncooperative (Hill value (n(H)) of approximately 1, apparent calcium affinity (K(0.5)) of 2-6 microm)) and cooperative (n(H) approximately 2, K(0.5) approximately 0.2 microm) calcium binding of the molecules, whereas UTP caused the molecules to highly cooperatively (n(H) approximately 4) bind calcium ions with a lowered K(0.5) of approximately 0.04 microm. When the enzyme molecules were solubilized with detergent, all of these NTPs reversibly degraded the calcium affinity of the molecule (from K(0.5) = 3-5 to &gt;40 microm), although the effect of the NTPs on the negatively cooperative manner (n(H) approximately 0.5) of calcium binding was not experimentally obtained. Taking into account the first part of this study (Nakamura, J., Tajima, G., Sato, C., Furukohri, T., and Konishi, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24180-24190) showing the improving effect of ATP on calcium binding of the membranous and solubilized molecules, the results show that ATP is the only intrinsic substrate for the enzyme molecule. This NTP regulation is discussed in terms of the oligomeric structure of the molecules.",M1
11575773,"Stabilities and isomeric equilibria in solutions of monomeric metal-ion complexes of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP4-) and inosine 5'-triphosphate (ITP4-) in comparison with those of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP4-).Under experimental conditions in which the self-association of the purine-nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (PuNTPs) GTP and <e>ITP</e> is negligible, potentiometric pH titrations were carried out to determine the stabilities of the M(H;PuNTP) and M(PuNTP)2-complexes where M2+ = Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+. Ba2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, or Cd2+ (I = 0.1 M, 25 degrees C). The stabilities of all M(GTP)2- and M(ITP)2- complexes are significantly larger than those of the corresponding complexes formed with pyrimidine-nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (PyNTPs), which had been determined previously under the same conditions. This increased complex stability is attributed, in agreement with previous 1H MNR shift studies, to the formation of macrochelates of the phosphate-coordinated metal ions with N7 of the purine residues. A similar enhanced stability (despite relatively large error limits) was observed for the M(H;PuNTP) complexes, in which H+ is bound to the terminal y-phosphate group, relative to the stability of the M(H;PyNTP)- species. The percentage of the macrochelated isomers in the M(GTP)2- and M(ITP)2- systems was quantified by employing the difference log KMM(PuNTP)-log KMM(PyNTP); the lowest and highest formation degrees of the macrochelates were observed for Mg(ITP)2- and Cu(GTP)2- with 17 +/- 11% and 97 +/- 1%, respectively. From previous studies of M(ATP)2- complexes, it is known that innersphere and outersphere macrochelates may form; that is, in the latter case a water molecule is between N7 and the phosphate-coordinated M2+. Similar conclusions are reached now by comparisons with earlier 1H MNR shift measurements, that is, that Mg(GTP)2- (21 +/- 11%), for example, exists largely in the form of an outersphere macrochelate and Zn(GTP)2- (68 +/- 4%) as an innersphere one. Generally, the overall percentage of macrochelate falls off for a given metal ion in the order M(GTP)2- &gt; M(ITP)2- &gt; M(ATP)2-; this is in accord with the decreasing basicity of N7 and the steric inhibition of the (C6)NH2 group in the adenine residue. Furthermore, although the absolute stability constants of the previously studied M(GMP), M(IMP), and M(AMP) complexes differ by about two to three log units from the present M(PuNTP)2- results, the formation degrees of the macrochelates are astonishingly similar for the two series of nucleotides for a given metal ion and purine-nucleobase residue. The conclusion that N7 of the guanine residue is an especially favored binding site for metal ions is also in accord with observations made for nucleic acids.",M1
11451960,"Bi-site catalysis in F1-ATPase: does it exist?The mechanism of action of F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase is controversial. Some favor a tri-site mechanism, where substrate must fill all three catalytic sites for activity, others a bi-site mechanism, where one of the three sites is always unoccupied. New approaches were applied to examine this question. First, <e>ITP</e> was used as hydrolysis substrate; lower binding affinities of ITP versus ATP enable more accurate assessment of sites occupancy. Second, distributions of all eight possible enzyme species (with zero, one, two or three sites filled) as fraction of total enzyme population at each ITP concentration were calculated, and compared with measured ITPase activity. Confirming data were obtained with ATP as substrate. Third, we performed a theoretical analysis of possible bi-site mechanisms. The results argue convincingly that bi-site hydrolysis activity is negligible, and may not even exist. Effectively, tri-site hydrolysis is the only mechanism. We argue that only tri-site hydrolysis drives subunit rotation. Theoretical analyses of possible bi-site mechanisms reveal serious flaws, not previously recognized. One is that, in bi-site catalysis, the predicted direction of subunit rotation is the same for both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis; a second is that infrequently occurring enzyme species are required.",M1
11344352,"Effects of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides on intracellular Ca2+ in human eosinophils: activation of purinergic P2Y receptors.BACKGROUND: Extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) increases human eosinophil intracellular Ca(2+) concentration; the mechanism of action is not fully known. ATP, a physiologic regulator, acts through 2 purinergic receptor types: cation channels (P2X) and G protein-coupled receptors (P2Y). OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at identifying the functional purinergic receptors in human eosinophils. METHODS: The relative potency of ATP, uridine (UTP), cytidine (CTP), and inosine (<e>ITP</e>) 5'-triphosphates (P2Y agonists); 2-methylthio-ATP (P2Y(1) agonist); and 2 P2X agonists, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was examined in Ca(2+)-sensitive Fura-2-labeled human eosinophils. For comparison, ATP effects were similarly studied in human neutrophils. P2X/P2Y mRNA expression in cells was examined by reverse transcription and PCR. RESULTS: The nucleotide potency order was UTP &gt; or = ATP &gt; ITP &gt;&gt;&gt; 2-methylthio-ATP &gt; alpha,beta-methylene-ATP = beta,gamma-methylene-ATP = CTP = 0 in eosinophils. Pertussis toxin (500 ng/mL) pretreatment abolished the effect of lower (10(-6) mol/L) but not higher (10(-5) mol/L) concentrations of ATP in eosinophils, whereas it attenuated the effects of 10(-4) mol/L ATP in neutrophils. The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (2 micromol/L) partially inhibited the effect of ATP in eosinophils but totally blocked it in neutrophils. Both cells constitutively express mRNA for P2X(1), P2X(4), P2X(5), P2Y(1), and P2Y(2), but not P2X(7), with much weaker expressions of P2X(4) and P2X(5) in neutrophils. Eosinophils cultured with the T(H)1 cytokine, IFN-gamma, expressed mRNA for P2X(7), a receptor linked to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the P2 purinergic receptor signal transduction pathways in eosinophils and neutrophils are different and are mediated by more than 1 subtype of functional P2Y receptors.",M1
11336985,"As to the clastogenic-, sister-chromatid exchange inducing-and cytotoxic activity of inosine triphosphate in cultures of human peripheral lymphocytes.The influence of commercial inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) on the chromosome aberration rate, the mitotic rate, sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency, and the proportion of first (X1), second (X2) and third (X3) division metaphases was investigated in 72h cultures of human peripheral lymphocytes. The blood donors had mild inactive arthrosis and a normal health check-up. All cultures of each volunteer were set-up simultaneously. In contrast to a previous report [Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 278 (1990) 238-244], it was demonstrated in two preliminary studies (number of subjects, n=5 each) that ITP at a final concentration of 100 microM does not induce chromosomal aberrations and, furthermore, that not ITP concentrations higher than 100 microM but ITP doses higher than 3.8mM prohibit culture growth. Based on these results, cultures with a final ITP concentration of 3.6mM (max.) and 1.8mM (max./2) were compared with control cultures (number of subjects n=10; three males and seven females, mean age x=57.6 years). Whereas no increase in the chromosomal breakage rate was observed in cultures with an ITP concentration of 1.8mM and only a marginally significant one (P=0.048) for 3.6mM ITP cultures, a highly significant induction of SCEs, not only at an ITP concentration of 3.6mM (P&lt;0.0001) but also at 1.8mM (P&lt;0.0001) was seen. The increase in the SCE frequency was not linear, but steeper from 0 to 1.8mM than from 1.8 to 3.6mM. Nevertheless, the difference between 1.8 and 3.6mM cultures was significant (P=0.027). The distribution of the number of SCEs per metaphase as well as the distribution of SCEs per chromosome correspond to the expected Poisson values. The investigation of the cytotoxic effect of the studied ITP concentrations revealed a highly significant reduction of the mitotic rate from 0 to 1.8mM as well as from 1.8 to 3.6mM in the aberration studies (all P values are equal to smallest possible one for a sample size of 10, namely, 0.002), and in the SCE studies there is a significant decrease in the X3 frequency when ITP is increased (0-1.8mM: P=0.0061 and 1.8-3.6mM: P&lt;0.0001). The proportion of X1 within all X1 and X2 metaphases changes significantly only at the second dose step (0-1.8mM ITP: P=0.22 and 1.8-3.6mM ITP: P&lt;0.0001). The results are discussed.",M1
11279248,"Purine but not pyrimidine nucleotides support rotation of F(1)-ATPase.The binding change model for the F(1)-ATPase predicts that its rotation is intimately correlated with the changes in the affinities of the three catalytic sites for nucleotides. If so, subtle differences in the nucleotide structure may have pronounced effects on rotation. Here we show by single-molecule imaging that purine nucleotides ATP, GTP, and <e>ITP</e> support rotation but pyrimidine nucleotides UTP and CTP do not, suggesting that the extra ring in purine is indispensable for proper operation of this molecular motor. Although the three purine nucleotides were bound to the enzyme at different rates, all showed similar rotational characteristics: counterclockwise rotation, 120 degrees steps each driven by hydrolysis of one nucleotide molecule, occasional back steps, rotary torque of approximately 40 piconewtons (pN).nm, and mechanical work done in a step of approximately 80 pN.nm. These latter characteristics are likely to be determined by the rotational mechanism built in the protein structure, which purine nucleotides can energize. With ATP and GTP, rotation was observed even when the free energy of hydrolysis was -80 pN.nm/molecule, indicating approximately 100% efficiency. Reconstituted F(o)F(1)-ATPase actively translocated protons by hydrolyzing ATP, GTP, and ITP, but CTP and UTP were not even hydrolyzed. Isolated F(1) very slowly hydrolyzed UTP (but not CTP), suggesting possible uncoupling from rotation.",M1
11278832,"Cloning, expression, and characterization of a human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase encoded by the itpa gene.<e>ITP</e> and dITP exist in all cells. dITP is potentially mutagenic, and the levels of these nucleotides are controlled by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (EC ). Here we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a 21.5-kDa human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (hITPase), an enzyme whose activity has been reported in many animal tissues and studied in populations but whose protein sequence has not been determined before. At the optimal pH of 10.0, recombinant hITPase hydrolyzed ITP, dITP, and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate to their respective monophosphates whereas activity with other nucleoside triphosphates was low. K(m) values for ITP, dITP, and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate were 0.51, 0.31, and 0.57 mm, respectively, and k(cat) values were 580, 360, and 640 s(-1), respectively. A divalent cation was absolutely required for activity. The gene encoding the hITPase cDNA sequence was localized by radiation hybrid mapping to chromosome 20p in the interval D20S113-D20S97, the same interval in which the ITPA inosine triphosphatase gene was previously localized. A BLAST search revealed the existence of many similar sequences in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell.",M1
10956016,"Nucleoside triphosphate specificity of tubulin.We have determined the binding affinity for binding of the four purine nucleoside triphosphates GTP, <e>ITP</e>, XTP, and ATP to E-site nucleotide- and nucleoside diphosphate kinase-depleted tubulin. The relative binding affinities are 3000 for GTP, 10 for ITP, 2 for XTP, and 1 for ATP. Thus, the 2-exocyclic amino group in GTP is important in determining the nucleotide specificity of tubulin and may interact with a hydrogen bond acceptor group in the protein. The 6-oxo group also makes a contribution to the high affinity for GTP. NMR ROESY experiments indicate that the four nucleotides have different average conformations in solution. ATP and XTP are characterized by a high anti conformation, ITP by a medium anti conformation, and GTP by a low anti conformation. Possibly, the preferred solution conformation contributes to the differences in affinities. When the tubulin E-site is saturated with nucleotide, there appears to be little difference in the ability of the four nucleotides to stimulate assembly. The critical protein concentration is essentially identical in reactions using the four nucleotides. All four of the nucleotides were hydrolyzed during the assembly reaction, and the NDPs were incorporated into the microtubule. We also examined the binding of two gamma-phosphoryl-modified GTP photoaffinity analogues, p(3)-1, 4-azidoanilido-GTP and p(3)-1,3-acetylanilido-GTP. These analogues are inhibitors of the assembly reaction and bind to tubulin with affinities that are 15- and 50-fold lower, respectively, than the affinty for GTP. The affinity of GTP is less sensitive to substitutions at the gamma-phosphoryl position that to changes in the purine ring.",M1
10419554,"Effects of guanine, inosine, and xanthine nucleotides on beta(2)-adrenergic receptor/G(s) interactions: evidence for multiple receptor conformations.The aim of our study was to examine the effects of different purine nucleotides [GTP, <e>ITP</e>, and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP)] on receptor/G protein coupling. As a model system, we used a fusion protein of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor and the alpha subunit of the G protein G(s). GTP was more potent and efficient than ITP and XTP at inhibiting ternary complex formation and supporting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation. We also studied the effects of several beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ligands on nucleotide hydrolysis and on AC activity in the presence of GTP, ITP, and XTP. The efficacy of agonists at promoting GTP hydrolysis correlated well with the efficacy of agonists for stimulating AC in the presence of GTP. This was, however, not the case for ITP hydrolysis and AC activity in the presence of ITP. The efficacy of ligands at stimulating AC in the presence of XTP differed considerably from the efficacies of ligands in the presence of GTP and ITP, and there was no evidence for receptor-regulated XTP hydrolysis. Our findings support the concept of multiple ligand-specific receptor conformations and demonstrate the usefulness of purine nucleotides as tools to study conformational states of receptors.",M1
10194349,"Identification of residues of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase that contribute to nucleotide binding and specificity.The apparent affinity of phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) of Escherichia coli for ATP is at least 10 times higher than for other nucleotides. Mutagenesis was directed toward five residues that may interact with ATP: Y41, F76, R77, R82, and R111. Alanine at position 41 or 76 increased the apparent Km by 49- and 62-fold, respectively. Position 41 requires the presence of a large hydrophobic residue and is not restricted to aromatic rings. Tryptophan and, to a lesser extent, phenylalanine could substitute at position 76. None of the mutants at 41 or 76 showed a change in the preference for alternative purines, although F76W used CTP 3 times better than the wild type enzyme. Mutations of R77 suggested that the interaction was hydrophobic with no influence on nucleotide preference. Mutation of R82 to alanine or glutamic acid increased the apparent Km for ATP by more than 20-fold and lowered the kcat/Km with ATP more than 30-fold. However, these mutants had a higher kcat/Km than wild type for both GTP and CTP, reflecting a loss of substrate preference. A loss in preference is seen as well with R111A where the kcat/Km for ATP decreases by only 68%, but the kcat/Km with GTP increases more than 10-fold. Activities with <e>ITP</e>, CTP, and UTP are also higher than with the wild type enzyme. Arginine residues at positions 82 and 111 are important dictators of nucleoside triphosphate preference.",M1
9989944,"Purification and properties of mycobacterial GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase.The enzyme that catalyzes the formation of GDP-d-mannose from GTP and alpha-d-mannose-1-P was purified about 2300-fold to near homogeneity from the soluble fraction of Mycobacterium smegmatis. At the final stage of purification, a major protein band of 37 kDa was observed and this band was specifically labeled, and in a concentration-dependent manner, by the photoaffinity probe 8-N3-GDP[32P]-d-mannose. The purified enzyme was stable for several months when kept in the frozen state. The 37-kDa band was subjected to protein sequencing and one peptide sequence of 25 amino acids showed over 80% identity to GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylases of pig liver and Saccharomyces cerevesiae. In contrast to some other bacterial GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylases, the mycobacterial enzyme was not multifunctional and did not have phosphomannose isomerase or phosphoglucose isomerase activity. Also, in contrast to the pig liver enzyme which uses mannose-1-P or glucose-1-P plus GTP to synthesize either GDP-mannose or GDP-glucose, the mycobacterial enzyme was specific for mannose-1-P as the sugar phosphate substrate. The enzyme was also relatively specific for GTP as the nucleoside triphosphate substrate. <e>ITP</e> was about 18% as effective as GTP, but ATP, CTP, and UTP were inactive. The activity of the enzyme was inhibited by GDP-glucose and glucose-1-P, although neither was a substrate for this enzyme. The pH optimum for the enzyme was 8.0, and Mg2+ was the best cation with optimum activity at about 5 mM. This enzyme is important for producing the activated form of mannose for formation of cell wall lipoarabinomannan and various mannose-containing glycolipids and polysaccharides.",M1
9585528,"Prodan fluorescence reflects differences in nucleotide-induced conformational states in the myosin head and allows continuous visualization of the ATPase reactions.The noncovalent fluorescent probe 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene (prodan) binds stoichiometrically to myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) without affecting the ATPase and actin-binding properties of S-1. Neither ATP nor actin interferes with the prodan binding. Free prodan exhibits a green emission peak at 520 nm. However, the prodan bound to S-1 and the S-1.ADP complex shows blue emission peaks at 460 and 450 nm, respectively, which allow easy separation of the fluorescence contributions from the free and bound probes. In the S-1.ADP.Pi state, the blue emission peak is further shifted to 445 nm with a large (4.5-fold) fluorescence enhancement. Thus, prodan in the presence of S-1 exhibits predominantly blue fluorescence only during ATP hydrolysis, and so visualizes the ATPase reaction continuously. The initial velocities of the steady state of the Mg2+-, Ca2+-, and actin-activated ATPases can be conveniently calculated from the blue fluorescence changes. The ability of different nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) to enhance the blue fluorescence of prodan follows the order ATP &gt; CTP &gt; UTP &gt; <e>ITP</e> &gt; GTP. This order agrees with those of the extent of hydrophobicity near the ribose of the corresponding nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) trapped to S-1 with orthovanadate (Vi) [Hiratsuka, T. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 155-162] and the ability of different NTPs to support force production in muscle fibers [Regnier, M., et al. (1993) Biophys. J. 64, A250]. The rate of formation of the corresponding S-1.NDP.Vi complex also follows this order, whereas the NTPase rate follows the reverse order. These results indicate that nucleotide-induced changes in prodan fluorescence correspond to the nucleotide-induced conformational states of S-1. Thus, the use of prodan in studies of the myosin ATPase offers a new and promising approach not only to monitoring the ATPase reaction but also to investigating the structural changes during ATP hydrolysis.",M1
9337071,"Functionally nonequivalent interactions of guanosine 5'-triphosphate, inosine 5'-triphosphate, and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate with the retinal G-protein, transducin, and with Gi-proteins in HL-60 leukemia cell membranes.G-proteins mediate signal transfer from receptors to effector systems. In their guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-bound form, G-protein alpha-subunits activate effector systems. Termination of G-protein activation is achieved by the high-affinity GTPase [E.C. 3.6.1.-] of their alpha-subunits. Like GTP, inosine 5'-triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) can support effector system activation. We studied the interactions of GTP, ITP, and XTP with the retinal G-protein, transducin (TD), and with G-proteins in HL-60 leukemia cell membranes. TD hydrolyzed nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (NTPs) in the order of efficacy GTP &gt; ITP &gt; XTP. NTPs eluted TD from rod outer segment disk membranes in the same order of efficacy. ITP and XTP competitively inhibited TD-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. In HL-60 membranes, the chemoattractants N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) effectively activated GTP and ITP hydrolysis by Gi-proteins. fMLP and LTB4 were at least 10-fold more potent activators of ITPase than of GTPase. Complement C5a effectively activated the GTPase of Gi-proteins but was only a weak stimulator of ITPase. The potency of C5a to activate GTP and ITP hydrolysis was similar. The fMLP-stimulated GTPase had a lower Km value than the fMLP-stimulated ITPase, whereas the opposite was true for the Vmax values. fMLP, C5a, and LTB4 did not stimulate XTP hydrolysis. Collectively, our data show that GTP, ITP, and XTP bind to G-proteins with different affinities, that G-proteins hydrolyze NTPs with different efficacies, and that chemoattractants stimulate GTP and ITP hydrolysis by Gi-proteins in a receptor-specific manner. On the basis of our results and the data in the literature, we put forward the hypothesis that GTP, ITP, and XTP act as differential signal amplifiers and signal sorters at the G-protein level.",M1
9266842,"Restoration of defective mechanochemical properties of cleaved actins by native tropomyosin: involvement of the 40-50 loop in subdomain 2 of actin in interaction with myosin and tropomyosin.Native tropomyosin activated sliding movement in vitro of F-actin with ATP by 30%. Actin cleaved at the 40-50 loop by subtilisin or proteinase K slid on HMM much slower than intact actin, but native tropomyosin strikingly recovered this defective motility of cleaved actin by 2 to 3 times. On the other hand, with ATP analogues of CTP and <e>ITP</e>, sliding movements of cleaved actin and particularly intact actin were inhibited by native tropomyosin, indicating that native tropomyosin augmented specificity of the myosin substrate of NTP. These results suggested that the 40-50 loop in the small domain 2 of actin interacted directly or indirectly with tropomyosin and play a significant role in cross talk between myosin and native tropomyosin.",M1
8999924,"Function of the novel subdomain in the RNA binding domain of transcription termination factor Rho from Micrococcus luteus.Transcription termination factor Rho from Micrococcus luteus, a high G + C Gram-positive bacterium, contains an unusual extra sequence within its RNA binding domain that is rich in Arg, Glu, and Asp residues and deficient in hydrophobic residues. To determine the role of this extra sequence, we compared the biochemical properties of a variant lacking nearly all the extra sequence, des(60-300) Rho, to that of wild-type M. luteus Rho. The two forms had very similar properties except that the des(60-300) Rho was unable to terminate transcription with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the promoter proximal sites used by the wild-type Rho on a lambda cro DNA template but could cause termination at more distal sites and did cause termination at proximal sites when <e>ITP</e> replaced GTP in the reaction mixture. The RNA binding properties of the two forms of this Rho with normal and inosine-substituted RNAs were found to correlate fully with their termination properties. These results indicate that the arginine-rich extra sequence is directly involved in the selection of the termination site and support the hypothesis that the sequence is present in M. luteus Rho to facilitate its binding to M. luteus transcripts, which are likely to have a high degree of base-paired secondary structure because of their high proportion of G residues.",M1
9030260,"Modification of membrane-bound F1 by p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine: sites of binding and effect on activity.Bovine heart submitochondrial particles (smp) were incubated with p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine (FSBA) in order to study the binding of this ligand and its effect on ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis in smp and to compare the results with those obtained with isolated F1. The binding was measured with the 14C-labeled compound. ATP hydrolysis was in all cases as much inhibited as succinate-driven ATP synthesis and <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis was more inhibited than ATP hydrolysis. The binding experiments show that modification of three nucleotide binding sites results in nearly complete inhibition of ATPase activity. In the presence of pyrophosphate up to 6 mol [14C]SBA/mol F1 can be bound. FSBA preferentially modifies amino acids of the alpha-subunits but also beta-subunits are modified. It is concluded that modification of both subunits results in inhibition of activity. The results are very well comparable with the results obtained with isolated F1, which indicates that our preparation of F1 is a good model for F1 in the intact system. Furthermore it is concluded that each alpha-subunit of F1 in smp, just like in the isolated form, contains two pockets where adenosine moieties can bind, one located above the P-loop, modifying alpha-Tyr-244 and alpha-Tyr-300 and the other one located below the P-loop where also the adenosine moiety of AD(T)P binds, modifying beta-Tyr-368.",M1
9094462,"Clastogenic activity in the plasma of scleroderma patients: a biomarker of oxidative stress.BACKGROUND: Scleroderma patients exhibit increased chromosomal instability due to circulating clastogenic plasma factors (CF). Formation and action mechanisms of CF are mediated by superoxide. In addition, previous work detected inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) in the plasma of 2 patients, and the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) was found to be increased. OBJECTIVE: To study correlations between CF, ITP and ADA levels, CF and disease activity, as well as other biomarkers of oxidative stress. METHODS: Clastogenic activity was evaluated by means of cytogenetic methods in 48 patients and 55 healthy subjects. ITP was detected by mass spectrometry and electrospray ionisation. ADA was measured with a colorimetric assay and malondialdehyde using the Yagi method. RESULTS: Clastogenic activity was significantly increased in patients' plasma compared to controls. In 10 patients CF, ITP and ADA were studied simultaneously. All three parameters were increased in the 7 patients of subgroups 2 (skin and esophagus involvement) and 3 (skin plus multiple organ involvement). ITP was not detected in 2 patients of subgroup 1 (skin involvement only) with low ADA and CF values. CONCLUSION: ITP, the deamination product of ATP, is one of the clastogenic and superoxide generating components of CF. The formation of this deamination product of ATP is probably related to the increase in ADA. CF are biomarkers of oxidative stress and can be used for evaluation of antioxidant treatments in scleroderma.",M1
8702471,"Reengineering the nucleotide cofactor specificity of the RecA protein by mutation of aspartic acid 100.We have recently obtained evidence for a direct linkage between the S0.5 (S0.5 is the substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity) value of a nucleoside triphosphate and the conformational state of the RecA-ssDNA complex, with an S0.5 value of 125 microM or less required for stabilization of the strand exchange-active conformation. For example, although ATP and <e>ITP</e> are hydrolyzed by the RecA protein with the same turnover number (18 min-1), ATP (S0.5 = 45 microM) functions as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction, whereas ITP (S0.5 = 500 microM) is inactive as a strand exchange cofactor. The RecA protein crystal structure suggests that cofactor specificity is determined by Asp100, which likely forms a hydrogen bond with the exocyclic 6-amino group of ATP; the higher S0. 5 value for ITP is presumably due to unfavorable interactions between Asp100 and the 6-carbonyl group of the inosine ring. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a mutant RecA protein in which Asp100 was replaced by an asparagine residue. The S0.5(ITP) for the [D100N]RecA protein is 125 microM, indicating favorable interactions between the Asn100 side chain and the 6-carbonyl group of ITP. Correspondingly, ITP functions as a cofactor for the strand exchange activity of the [D100N]RecA protein. This result demonstrates the importance of the residue at position 100 in determining nucleotide cofactor specificity and underscores the importance of the S0.5 value in the RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction.",M1
8649181,"Force development with inosine triphosphate and uridine triphosphate in chemically skinned vascular smooth muscle.The contraction of vascular smooth muscle is thought to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation of the 20,000 dalton light chains of myosin, catalyzed by myosin light chain kinase that is dependent on calcium and calmodulin. With phosphorylation, there is a coincident increase in the actin-activated myosin NTPase activity, cross bridge interaction and contractile activity. However, this myosin phosphorylation mechanism may not be the sole factor controlling actin-myosin interaction in vascular smooth muscle. Other mechanisms may function in addition to this myosin-linked regulation. A calcium-insensitive regulation of contraction was observed in helical strips of chemically skinned (Triton X-100) arterial smooth muscle. Millimolar concentrations of inosine triphosphate and uridine triphosphate supported concentration dependent force development in the absence of calcium. Force development was a function of the MgNTP concentration. At high free calcium concentrations, an additional component of force was observed. <e>ITP</e> and UTP, in contrast to ATP, are less effective substrates for the myosin light chain kinase, and their effect on actin-myosin interaction is thus less than that of ATP. They are, however, utilized by the myosin NTPase after treatment by ATP-gamma-S. The efficacy of the substrate for the activated NTPase is greater for UTP than ITP than for ATP.",M1
7708774,"Isolation of an amino-terminal deleted recombinant ADP-ribosylation factor 1 in an activated nucleotide-free state.ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that activate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase in vitro and participate in intracellular vesicular membrane trafficking. ARFs are activated when bound GDP is replaced by GTP and inactivated by hydrolysis of bound GTP to yield ARF-GDP. Usually, ARFs are isolated in an inactive GDP-bound state and require addition of GTP along with detergent or phospholipid for activity. Purified mutant recombinant ARF1 lacking the first 13 amino acids (r delta 13ARF1-P) stimulated cholera toxin activity essentially equally with or without added GTP (and phospholipid or detergent), at least in part due to the presence of bound nucleotides, which later were identified as GTP and GDP. Nucleotide-free r delta 13ARF1 (r delta 13ARF1-F), prepared by dialysis against 7 M urea, was active without added GTP in the absence of SDS but inactive without added GTP in its presence. Renaturation of r delta 13ARF1-F in the presence of GTP, <e>ITP</e>, or GDP yielded, respectively, r delta 13ARF1-GTP and r delta 13ARF1-ITP, which were active, and r delta 13ARF1-GDP, which was inactive. Effects of phospholipids and detergents on nucleotide exchangeability evaluated as effects on activity of rARF1 and r delta 13ARF1-F differed. With r delta 13ARF1-F, 100 microM ITP and 100 microM GTP were essentially equally effective in the presence of cardiolipin or SDS. The finding that r delta 13ARF1 differs from rARF1 in the effects of phospholipids and detergents on nucleotide binding is consistent with the conclusion that the ARF amino terminus plays an important role in nucleotide binding and its specificity as well as the molecular conformation and associated activity.",M1
8030373,"Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase from human placenta--inhibition by free magnesium ions of <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis.The effects of Mg2+ and bicarbonate on the kinetics of ITP hydrolysis by soluble ATPase (F1) from human placental mitochondria were studied. Increasing amounts of Mg2+ at fixed ITP concentration, caused a marked activation of F1 followed by inhibition at higher Mg2+ concentration. The appropriate substrate for the mitochondrial F1 seems to be the MgITP complex as almost no ITP was hydrolysed in the absence of magnesium. Mg2+ behaved as a competitive inhibitor towards the MgITP complex. In this respect the human placental enzyme differ from that from other sources such as yeast, beef liver or rat liver. The linearity of the plot presenting competitive inhibition by free Mg2+ of MgITP hydrolysis (in the presence of activating bicarbonate anion) suggests that both Mg2+ and MgITP bind to the same catalytic site (Km(MgITP) = 0.46 mM, Ki(Mg) = 4 mM). When bicarbonate was absent in the ITPase assay, placental F1 exhibited apparent negative cooperativity in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+, just as it did with MgATP as a substrate under similar conditions. Bicarbonate ions eliminated the negative cooperativity with respect to ITP (as the Hill coefficient of 0.46 was brought to approx. 1), and thus limited inhibition by free Mg2+. The results presented suggest that the concentration of free magnesium ions may be an important regulatory factor of the human placental F1 activity.",M1
8407901,"Glutamine 170 to tyrosine substitution in yeast mitochondrial F1 beta-subunit increases catalytic site interaction with GDP and IDP and produces negative cooperativity of GTP and <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis.Glutamine 170 to tyrosine mutation in the beta-subunit from Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondrial F1 was found to increase both affinity for ADP, apparent negative cooperativity of ATPase activity, and sensitivity to azide inhibition (Falson, P., Di Pietro, A., Jault, J.-M., Gautheron, D.C., and Boutry, M. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 975, 119-126). The mutation is shown here to increase the affinity for GDP, IDP, and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imidotriphosphate), which are competitive inhibitors of GTPase and ITPase activities. Various fluorescence approaches also reveal an increased affinity of the catalytic site in mutant as compared with wild-type enzyme for GDP, IDP, and 2'(3')-N-methylanthraniloyl GDP. The mutation alters the maximal rates and pH dependence of GTPase and ITPase activities, whereas wild-type F1 exhibits single optima at pH 7.5-8.0. The pH activity profiles of the mutant enzyme for these substrates are biphasic, with optima at pH 8.5-9.0 and below 6.5. The mutation increases the sensitivity of GTPase and ITPase activities to azide inhibition, which increases with decreasing pH. At pH 6.0-7.0, an apparent negative cooperativity is observed when mutant F1 hydrolyzes GTP or ITP, whereas the wild-type enzyme shows Michaelian kinetics. Addition of bicarbonate at pH 7.0 substantially stimulates GTP or ITP hydrolysis and abolishes the apparent negative cooperativity by the mutant enzyme; on the contrary, the anion produces a slight inhibition of these activities catalyzed by wild-type F1. The overall results suggest that apparent negative cooperativity can be observed with GTP or ITP hydrolysis provided that the release of the respective diphosphate is a rate-limiting step.",M1
8349011,"Diffusion limited component of mitochondrial F1-ATPase.1. The possibility that the rate of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase approaches the diffusion-controlled limits was investigated by measuring the values of kcat and kl (kcat/Km) as a function of increasing viscosity. 2.

Viscosity also decreases kcat, but only at high concentrations of viscosogenic agents. 4. These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis is at least partly diffusion-controlled, although a general nonspecific perturbation in the enzyme structure is also effected by viscosity.",M1
8489739,"Evidence that the presumptive second nucleotide interacting site on actin is of low specificity and affinity.The contractile protein actin contains one mole of firmly bound nucleotide and a number of divalent cations bound with different affinities. During recent years evidence for a second nucleotide interacting site on actin has been reported. Therefore, a specific search for the presence of a second nucleotide-interacting site on actin was undertaken. For this purpose G- and F-actin or actin in complex with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) was passed over ADP-agarose which was found to retain all three forms of actin. Nucleotide bound to the high affinity site of actin did not exchange during passage and retention to agarose-immobilized ADP, thus indicating the presence of a second nucleotide interacting site. This site was found to be equally accessible in G- and F-actin and in the actin-DNase I complex, whereas DNase I alone passed unretained through this column. A number of nucleotides and phosphorylated compounds were tested for their ability to compete with immobilized ADP for actin interaction. It was found that all forms of actin are liberated only by high concentrations (5mM) of ADP, ATP and NADH, by 1mM CTP and <e>ITP</e>, and by high salt concentrations (150mM NaCl). Since it was found that EDTA- and heat-treated actin were also retained on ADP-agarose, we conclude that this second nucleotide interacting site is of limited specificity, low affinity, and not dependent on the native configuration of actin. It exhibits characteristics of an unspecific, polyanionic site, but may represent the low affinity phosphate binding site.",M1

1422572,"Effect of nucleotides on the cytosolic free calcium activity and inositol phosphate formation in human glomerular epithelial cells.1. Glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) were cultured from human kidneys and immunologically characterized. 2. The effect of extracellular nucleotides on the cytosolic free calcium activity [Ca2+]i was investigated with the fura-2 microfluorescence method. Extracellular UTP, UDP, UMP, ATP, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)-trisphosphate (ATP-gamma-S), inosine-triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>), guanyltriphosphate (GTP), 2-methylthio-ATP, AMP, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and adenosine led to a rapid, transient, concentration-dependent increase of [Ca2+]i, followed by a plateau above the baseline level. 3. In a calcium-free extracellular solution, the rapid increase of [Ca2+]i was still present, whereas the plateau level was abolished. 4. ATP and UTP (ED50 both: 10(-5) M) stimulated inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) formation in GEC. 5. The order of potency for the purine nucleotides in stimulating InsP3 formation was ATP = ATP-gamma-S greater than ADP greater than 2-methylthio-ATP greater than AMP = a,beta methylene-ATP = adenosine. 6. The increase of InsP3 induced by ATP (10(-5) M) could be inhibited by the P2 receptor blocker suramin (greater than 10(-4) M). Reactive blue 2 exhibited a weak stimulating effect on the InsP3 formation and only a weak inhibitory effect at a concentration of 10(-3) M was observed. 7. Protein kinase C activation by preincubation of GEC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 ng ml-1, 15 min) abolished the effect of ATP (10(-5) M) on InsP3 formation. Downregulation of protein kinase C by long term incubation (18 h) with PMA had no significant effect on the phosphoinositol turnover induced by ATP.8. The results indicate that an increase of [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphate breakdown can be mediated via activation of a P2 receptor in human GEC.",M1
1610824,"Binding of adenine nucleotides to the F1-inhibitor protein complex of bovine heart submitochondrial particles.The binding of ATP radiolabeled in the adenine ring or in the gamma- or alpha-phosphate to F1-ATPase in complex with the endogenous inhibitor protein was measured in bovine heart submitochondrial particles by filtration in Sephadex centrifuge columns or by Millipore filtration techniques. These particles had 0.44 +/- 0.05 nmol of F1 mg-1 as determined by the method of Ferguson et al. [(1976) Biochem. J. 153, 347]. By incubation of the particles with 50 microM ATP, and low magnesium concentrations (less than 0.1 microM MgATP), it was possible to observe that 3.5 mol of [gamma-32P]ATP was tightly bound per mole of F1 before the completion of one catalytic cycle. With [gamma-32P]<e>ITP</e>, only one tight binding site was detected. Half-maximal binding of adenine nucleotides took place with about 10 microM. All the bound radioactive nucleotides were released from the enzyme after a chase with cold ATP or ADP; 1.5 sites exchanged with a rate constant of 2.8 s-1 and 2 with a rate constant of 0.45 s-1. Only one of the tightly bound adenine nucleotides was released by 1 mM ITP; the rate constant was 3.2 s-1. It was also observed that two of the bound [gamma-32P]ATP were slowly hydrolyzed after removal of medium ATP; when the same experiment was repeated with [alpha-32P]ATP, all the label remained bound to F1, suggesting that ADP remained bound after completion of ATP hydrolysis. Particles in which the natural ATPase inhibitor protein had been released bound tightly only one adenine nucleotide per enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
1606139,"Effect of nucleotide cofactor structure on recA protein-promoted DNA pairing. 2. DNA renaturation reaction.We have examined the effects of the structurally related nucleoside triphosphates, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), purine riboside triphosphate (PTP), inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), on the recA protein-promoted DNA renaturation reaction (phi X DNA). In the absence of nucleotide cofactor, the recA protein first converts the complementary single strands into unit-length duplex DNA and other relatively small paired DNA species; these initial products are then slowly converted into more complex multipaired network DNA products. ATP and PTP stimulate the conversion of initial product DNA into network DNA, whereas ITP and GTP completely suppress network DNA formation. The formation of network DNA is also inhibited by all four of the corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, ADP, PDP, IDP, and GDP. Those nucleotides which stimulate the formation of network DNA are found to enhance the formation of large recA-ssDNA aggregates, whereas those which inhibit network DNA formation cause the dissociation of these nucleoprotein aggregates. These results not only implicate the nucleoprotein aggregates as intermediates in the formation of network DNA, but also establish the functional equivalency of ITP and GTP with the nucleoside diphosphates. Additional experiments indicate that the net effect of ITP and GTP on the DNA renaturation reaction is dominated by the corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, IDP and GDP, that are generated by the NTP hydrolysis activity of the recA protein.",M1
1606138,"Effect of nucleotide cofactor structure on recA protein-promoted DNA pairing. 1. Three-strand exchange reaction.The structurally related nucleoside triphosphates, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), purine riboside triphosphate (PTP), inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), are all hydrolyzed by the recA protein with the same turnover number (17.5 min-1). The S0.5 values for these nucleotides increase progressively in the order ATP (45 microM), PTP (100 microM), ITP (300 microM), and GTP (750 microM). PTP, ITP, and GTP are each competitive inhibitors of recA protein-catalyzed ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, indicating that these nucleotides all compete for the same catalytic site on the recA protein. Despite these similarities, ATP and PTP function as cofactors for the recA protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction, whereas ITP and GTP are inactive as cofactors. The strand exchange activity of the various nucleotides correlates directly with their ability to support the isomerization of the recA protein to a strand exchange-active conformational state. The mechanistic deficiency of ITP and GTP appears to arise as a consequence of the hydrolysis of these nucleotides to the corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, IDP and GDP. We speculate the nucleoside triphosphates with S0.5 values greater than 100 microM will be intrinsically unable to sustain the strand exchange-active conformational state of the recA protein during ongoing NTP hydrolysis and will therefore be inactive as cofactors for the strand exchange reaction.",M1
1314945,"Purinergic receptor regulation of signal transduction in NCB-20 cells.In the present paper, P1 and P2 purinergic receptors and their control of signal transduction pathways were investigated in NCB-20 cells. ATP elicited an increase in [Ca2+]i. The purinergic receptor subtype involved was identified by comparing the actions of a range of nucleotides. UTP was the most potent agonist in elevating [Ca2+]i, with an EC50 value of 6.2 +/- 0.5 microM. UTP, ATP (EC50, 17.3 +/- 1.5 microM), adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (23 +/- 3 microM), and <e>ITP</e> (55 +/- 4 microM) exerted similar maximal effects. Other nucleotides tested, including beta, gamma-methylene-ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP, which are considered prototypic agonists for P2x and P2y receptors, respectively, were ineffective; in general, modifications in the ribose-triphosphate chain and substitution on the 2-position of the purines reduced the efficacy of nucleotides. This pharmacological characterization indicated that a putative P2u receptor mediates the [Ca2+]i elevation elicited by nucleotides in NCB-20 cells. The increase in [Ca2+]i originates from intracellular Ca2+ stores; blockade of Ca2+ entry does not affect the rise in [Ca2+]i. In contrast, pretreatment with the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin or with bradykinin, a hormone that releases Ca2+ from inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores, does preclude the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by ATP. ATP and UTP also transiently inhibit cAMP accumulation in the intact cell, presumably via a Ca(2+)-mediated mechanism. The finding of a P2u receptor in NCB-20 cells adds to a growing perception that P2 receptors are widely distributed. Besides the P2u receptor, NCB-20 cells express adenosine A2 receptors, coupled to stimulation of cAMP accumulation. The presence of both P1 and P2 purinergic receptors permits a sequential modulation of distinct second messenger levels associated with a common stimulus, ATP.",M1
1515468,"Photochemical cross-linking of guanosine 5'-triphosphate to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP).Mammalian phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) specifically requires a guanosine or inosine nucleotide as a substrate; however, the structural basis for this nucleotide specificity is not yet known. Because affinity labels derived from guanosine have not yielded a stable, modified peptide in quantities sufficient for sequence analysis, we have investigated the utility of direct photochemical cross-linking of GTP to PEPCK in order to identify the nucleotide binding site. UV irradiation at a distance of 2 cm by a Mineralight lamp (330 microW/cm2) results in the attachment of [alpha-32P]GTP to PEPCK via a stable, covalent linkage in a reaction that is dependent upon GTP concentration and duration of irradiation. After 10 min of irradiation, more than 0.2 mol of [alpha-32P] GTP is incorporated per mole of PEPCK; under these conditions the GTP concentration required for half-maximal labeling is 69 microM. The substrates phosphoenolpyruvate, <e>ITP</e>, and GDP provide protection against photolabeling, as do Mn2+ and Mg2+. One major and one minor radioactive peptide derived from proteolytic digests of photolabeled PEPCK have been isolated and identified. The major modified peptide has been provisionally assigned to an acidic region near the C-terminus, and the minor peptide has been identified as Ser462-Lys471.",M1

We studied further whether nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP can be also determined in a similar manner if they were incubated for a longer period with an increased amount of hexokinase. It was shown that CTP, GTP, <e>ITP</e>, and UTP can be utilized to produce the corresponding amount of NADPH after an incubation of at least 60 min and that 0 to 50 nmols of these nucleotides were able to be determined fluorometrically.",M1
1795598,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and other nucleotides stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine in intact fibroblasts.Addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to [14C]ethanolamine-prelabeled NIH 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in rapid formation of [14C]ethanolamine from the prelabeled cellular phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) pool. After 2-min exposure, 10 microM ATP had near maximal effects on PtdEtn hydrolysis. Several other nucleotides, including UTP, <e>ITP</e>, and the stable ATP analog adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), also had stimulatory effects on PtdEtn hydrolysis with a potency comparable to that observed with ATP. The same nucleotides which acted on PtdEtn hydrolysis also had similar stimulatory effects on the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) in [14C]choline-labeled cells. In isolated membranes, Mg2+ greatly enhanced the stimulatory effects of ATP and ATP gamma S, but not of other nucleotides, on the hydrolysis of PtdEtn and PtdCho. Results indicate that in isolated membranes, both ATP and ATP gamma S stimulate phospholipid hydrolysis by two different mechanisms, but in intact cells only one of these mechanisms appears to be responsive to externally added nucleotides.",M1
2071935,"Extracellular ATP and some of its analogs induce transient rises in cytosolic free calcium in individual canine keratinocytes.Changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca++]i) play an important role in a variety of biochemical reactions that lead to cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation. The response of [Ca++]i to extracellular nucleotides (ATP, UTP, <e>ITP</e>, and AMP-PNP) was determined in individual canine keratinocytes using the fluorescent probe fura-2 and digital video fluorescence imaging microscopy. In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular Ca++, 100 and 500 microM ATP caused a rapid (less than 9 sec) three- to twelvefold rise in [Ca++]i above resting levels of 50-150 nM followed by occasional fluctuations. Small responses were elicited with doses as low as 0.1 microM ATP. The response of cells stimulated with 500 microM ATP in Ca(++)-free medium was characterized by 1.5 to 3 times rapid initial peak followed by a decrease of [Ca++]i below resting levels. Loss of response occurred in the majority of keratinocytes preincubated for 30 min in Ca(++)-free medium. UTP was as effective as ATP in stimulating rises in [Ca++]i in keratinocytes. Smaller elevations in [Ca++]i up to four- to fivefold resting levels were noted with 100 microM AMP-PNP or 500 microM ITP. Desensitization of cells was demonstrated when a second stimulation followed the primary ATP or UTP treatment. These results are suggestive of the presence of purinergic receptors in the cytoplasmic membrane of canine keratinocytes. Experiments using the calcium channel blocker lanthanum suggest that ATP-induced initial rises and sustained levels of [Ca++]i are dependent on the release of Ca++ from intracellular stores. These intracellular Ca++ stores appear to be rapidly depleted after removal of extracellular calcium ([Ca++]e), thereby abolishing ATP-induced [Ca++]i increases.",M1
1868851,"Acid-base properties of nucleosides and nucleotides as a function of concentration. Comparison of the proton affinity of the nucleic base residues in the monomeric and self-associated, oligomeric 5'-triphosphates of inosine (<e>ITP</e>), guanosine (GTP), and adenosine (ATP).The acid-base properties of the nucleic base residues of ITP, GTP, and ATP, and for comparison also as far as possible of the corresponding nucleosides, were studied in dependence on their concentration, i.e. on the effect of self-association. From the dependence between the 1H-NMR chemical shifts of H-2 (where applicable), H-8, and H-1', and the pD of the solutions, the acidity constants for the deprotonation of the D+(N-7) site in D2(ITP)2-, D2(GTP)2-, D(Ino)+, and D(Guo)+, and of the D+(N-1) site in D2(ATP)2- and D(Ado)+ were calculated. Chemical shift/pD profiles for a whole series of varying concentrations of the nucleic base derivatives (= N) were constructed, including those for infinite dilution (delta o), which give the acidity constant for the monomeric N, and for infinitely concentrated solutions (delta infinity), which give the acidity constant of an N in an infinitely long stack. The acidity constants determined from the delta o/pD plots are in excellent agreement with the pKa values measured by potentiometric pH titrations of highly diluted solutions of N. The effects of self-association are striking; e.g. the pKa value of the D+(N-7) site in D2(GTP)2- is lowered by about 1 (as calculated from the delta o/pD and delta infinity/pD profiles), while the pKa value of the D+(N-1) site in D2(ATP)2- is increased by approximately 0.3; i.e. in the first case deprotonation is facilitated and in the second it is inhibited. The increasing inhibition of the H+(N-1) deprotonation with an increasing ATP concentration is due to the high stability of the dimeric [H2(ATP)]2(4-) stack for which the intermolecular H+(N-1)/gamma-P(OH)(O)2- ion pairs between the two ATP molecules are crucial. In those cases where no other significant interaction but aromatic-ring stacking in the self-association process occurs, the release of protons from protonated nitrogen-ring sites is facilitated with increasing stacking; this holds not only for D2(GTP)2- as indicated above, but also for D2(ITP)2-, D(Ino)+, and D(Ado)+. The latter example especially suggests that the situation for the D2(ATP)2- system is exceptional. Some consequences of the considered acid-base properties for biological systems are indicated.",M1
1858858,"Regulation of permeabilized endothelial cell retraction by myosin phosphorylation.Permeabilized endothelial cell monolayers retracted on exposure to ATP and Ca2+. ADP, inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>), GTP, adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATP-gamma S), and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate failed to support retraction. However, ATP gamma S, a substrate for myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) but not myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase), combined with ITP, a substrate for myosin ATPase but not MLCK, supported retraction. Two MLCK pseudosubstrate peptides, M5 and SM-1, inhibited endothelial cell retraction equally and more effectively than myosin kinase-inhibitory peptide with a sequence based on the phosphorylated site of myosin light chain. M5 was shown to inhibit thiophosphorylation of endothelial cell myosin light chains. Endothelial cells incubated with exogenous unregulated kinase in the presence of ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid retracted on addition of ATP. This retraction was accompanied by thiophosphorylation of the 19 kDa myosin light chains in the presence of ATP gamma 35S. The N-ethylmaleimide-modified subfragment 1 of myosin heads, a specific inhibitor of actin-myosin interaction, prevented retraction. These data add support to the proposal of a central role for MLCK activation of myosin in endothelial retraction.",M1
2223815,"Influence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on the deformability of human erythrocytes.Effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) on the deformability of human erythrocytes was examined with a rheoscope under shear stress of 8-82 dyn/cm2. With increasing 2,3-DPG in erythrocytes (from 5 to 15 mM/l cells) by incubating with inosine and pyruvate in isotonic 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline, erythrocyte deformability under uniform shear stress was remarkably impaired. But reduction of 2,3-DPG (from 5 to 2.2 mM/l cells) did not affect the deformability. In 2,3-DPG-enriched erythrocytes, increased intracellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), decreased intracellular pH, and increased contents of ATP and IMP (and <e>ITP</e>) were observed. (1) When the MCHC (i.e., the internal viscosity) was normalized by suspending in hypotonic medium, the deformability of 2,3-DPG-enriched erythrocytes was greatly improved, but still decreased. (2) The change of intracellular pH between 6.5 and 7.5 (as compared adjusting to same MCHC) did not alter the deformability. (3) The changes of purine nucleotides, ATP (0.6-2.1 mM/l cells), IMP (0-0.9 mM/l cells) and ITP (0-0.5 mM/l cells) did not alter the erythrocyte deformability. In conclusion, decreased deformability of erythrocytes induced by augmentation of 2,3-DPG is due mainly to the increased internal viscosity and due partly to the increased membrane viscoelasticity.",M1
2146119,"Degradation of insulin in isolated liver endosomes is functionally linked to ATP-dependent endosomal acidification.The degradation of insulin in isolated liver endosomes and the relationships of this process with ATP-dependent endosomal acidification have been studied. Incubation of endosomal fractions containing 125I-insulin in isotonic KCl at 30 degrees C resulted in a rapid loss of insulin integrity as judged from trichloroacetic acid precipitability, Sephadex G-50 chromatography, immunoreactivity and receptor binding ability, with a maximum at pH 5-6 (t1/2: 10, 10, 6 and 6 min, respectively). On a log/log plot, the amount of acid-soluble products generated was linearly related to the amount of insulin associated with endosomes (slope, 0.80). Upon incubation, virtually all acid-soluble products diffused out of endosomes as judged from their solubility in aqueous poly(ethyleneglycol). In permeabilized endosomes, intact insulin was also released in part extraluminally, but only when degradation was inhibited did this release increase with lowering pH. ATP shifted the pH for maximal insulin degradation to about 7.5-8.5 and caused endosomal acidification as judged from the uptake of acridine orange and the fluorescence of internalized fluorescein-labeled dextran and galactosylated bovine serum albumin (delta pH about 0.8-0.9). GTP, <e>ITP</e> and UTP exerted comparable effects but with lower potencies. The ability of ATP to alter the pH dependence of insulin degradation was maximal in the presence of Cl-, other anions being less effective (Br- greater than gluconate = SO4(2-) greater than NO3- = sucrose = mannitol) and/or inhibitory (NO3-). Na+, K+ and Li+ supported more effectively ATP-dependent insulin degradation than did choline. Divalent cations were required for the ATP effect (Mg2+ = Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ni2+ = Zn2 greater than Ca2+). Little or no effects of ATP occurred in the presence of proton ionophores such as monensin and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone, and inhibitors of the proton ATPase such as N-ethylmaleimide. The abilities of nucleotides, ions and inhibitors to support or inhibit ATP-dependent insulin degradation were well correlated with their abilities to affect ATP-dependent acidification. The acidotropic agents chloroquine and quinacrine caused a leftward shift in the pH dependence of insulin degradation and a decrease in maximal degradation; in the presence of ATP, chloroquine almost completely inhibited degradation at pH 5-9. It is concluded that ATP-dependent acidification, in part by enhancing the dissociation of the insulin-receptor complex, is required for optimum degradation of insulin within liver endosomes.",M1
2167851,"Comparison of the self-association properties of the 5'-triphosphates of inosine (<e>ITP</e>), guanosine (GTP), and adenosine (ATP). Further evidence for ionic interactions in the highly stable dimeric [H2(ATP)]2(4-) stack.The concentration dependence of the chemical shifts for the hydrogens H-2, H-8 and H-1' of ITP and for H-8 and H-1' of GTP has been measured in D2O at 25 degrees C under several degrees of protonation in the pD range 1.2-8.4. For reasons of comparison, inosine and guanosine have been included in the study The results are consistent with the isodesmic model of indefinite noncooperative stacking. The association constants for the nucleosides (Ns) inosine and guanosine decrease with increasing protonation: Ns greater than D(Ns)+/Ns in a 1:1 ratio greater than D(Ns)+. In contrast, a maximum is observed with ITP and GTP; the stacking tendency of GTP following the series: GTP4- less than or equal to D(GTP)3- (K approximately 0.7 M-1) less than D(GTP)3-/D2(GTP)2- in a 1:1 ratio (K approximately 2.9 M-1) greater than D2(GTP)2- greater than D3(GTP)- (K approximately 1.5 M-1). The order of the series with ITP corresponds to that with GTP, but the association constants are slightly smaller. At the maximum of the self-association tendency the triphosphate residue has only a minor influence; this follows from the fact that the association constants for the 1:1 ratios of Ino/D(Ino)+ and D(ITP)3-/D2(ITP)2- are identical within experimental error; this holds also for Guo/D(Guo)+ and D(GTP)3-/D2(GTP)2-; in all these pairs the K-7 site is 50% protonated. Comparison of the association constant for the deprotonated species shows that here charge effects, i.e. repulsion between the negatively charged triphosphate chains, are important: Ino (K approximately 3.3 M-1) greater than ITP4- (K approximately 0.4 M-1) and Guo (K approximately 8 M-1) greater than GTP4- (K approximately 0.8 M-1). In addition the series holds: Ado (K approximately 15 M-1) greater than Guo greater than Ino. However, most important is the comparison of the ITP and GTP series with previous data for ATP: ATP4- (K approximately 1.3 M-1) less than D(ATP)3- (2.1 M-1) less than 1:1 ratio of D(ATP)3-/D2(ATP)2- (6 M-1) much less than D2(ATP)2- (approximately 200 M-1) much greater than D3(ATP)- (K less than or equal to 17 M-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1
2117444,"Stimulation of Ca2(+)-independent catecholamine secretion from digitonin-permeabilized bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by guanine nucleotide analogues. Relationship to arachidonate release.The effect of GTP analogues on catecholamine secretion and [3H]arachidonic acid release from digitonin-permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells was examined. Several GTP analogues stimulated Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis, with the order of efficacy being XTP greater than <e>ITP</e> greater than guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppG) greater than guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]). The stimulatory effect of the GTP analogues appeared to be due to activation of a conventional GTP-binding protein, as it was inhibited by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[S]). In contrast, Ca2(+)-dependent exocytosis was only partially inhibited by high doses of GDP[S]. GTP did not stimulate Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis, but instead was found to inhibit secretion caused by micromolar Ca2+. Arachidonic acid (100 microM) also stimulated Ca2(+)-independent catecholamine secretion. Determination of the effect of GTP analogues on release of free [3H]arachidonic acid into the medium showed that it was stimulated by GTP[S] but inhibited by GTP, p[NH]ppG, ITP and XTP. The inhibition of [3H]arachidonic acid release by XTP was not prevented by GDP[S]. These results demonstrate that activation of a GTP-binding protein by certain GTP analogues can induce Ca2(+)-independent secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells and that the effect of GTP analogues on Ca2(+)-independent secretion can be dissociated from generation of arachidonic acid.",M1
2141603,"Differentiation of the nucleotide-binding sites on nucleotide-depleted mitochondrial F1-ATPase by means of a fluorescent ADP analogue.The interaction of the fluorescent ADP analogue lin-benzo-ADP (containing a linearly extended version of adenine, in which a benzene ring is inserted between pyrimidine and imidazole ring) with nucleotide-depleted mitochondrial F1 was investigated. It was found that lin-benzo-ADP is able to occupy all six nucleotide-binding sites present on the enzyme. Two sites exhibit a very high affinity for the analogue (dissociation constant, Kd, less than 10 nM) and bind it rapidly (association rate constant, k+1, about 1.10(6) M-1 S-1). A third site shows a lower affinity for the analogue (Kd = 1-2 microM) and is occupied relatively fast (k+1 approximately 10(4) M-1 S-1). Binding of lin-benzo-ADP to these three sites is prevented not only in the presence of excess ADP and ATP, but also by IDP and <e>ITP</e>, thus indicating that these sites are the catalytic ones. As it will be discussed, this conclusion is further corroborated by the finding that release of the analogue from the two high affinity sites can be promoted by binding of nucleoside di- and triphosphates to the third site. The remaining three sites were found to bind lin-benzo-ADP with identical affinity (Kd = 1-2 microM) and with a rather low association rate (k+1 = 300-600 M-1 S-1). Binding of the analogue to them is only prevented by ADP and ATP, but not by IDP and ITP, which confirms that these sites are the noncatalytic ones. The analogue could be displaced by excess ADP also from these sites; however, in contrast to the catalytic sites, no promotive effect was observed here. The obvious changes in the nucleotide binding behavior of the non-catalytic sites after depletion of endogenous nucleotides will be discussed.",M1
2139876,"Tyrosine alpha 244 is derivatized when the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase is inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylethenoadenosine.The bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1) is inactivated by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylethenoadenosine (FSB epsilon A) with pseudo-first order kinetics. The dependence of the rate of inactivation on the concentration of FSB epsilon A revealed an apparent Kd of 0.25 mM. ATP and ADP, and to a lesser extent, <e>ITP</e> and IDP provide partial protection against inactivation by the reagent. Isolation and sequence analysis of major radioactive fragments in peptic or cyanogen bromide digests of MF1 inactivated with [3H]FSB epsilon A indicate that modification of Tyr-alpha 244 is associated with the loss of activity observed. Assessment of the amount of Tyr-alpha 244 derivatized with [3H]FSB epsilon A at specific points during inactivation of the ATPase indicates that maximal inactivation is achieved on modification of this residue in slightly greater than one copy of the alpha subunit. The following characteristics of inactivation of MF1 by FSB epsilon A have also been determined. (a) The rate of inactivation of ITPase activity by FSB epsilon A is 1.4 times greater than that observed for inactivation of ATPase activity under identical conditions. (b) After maximally inactivating the capacity of MF1 to hydrolyze saturating ATP with FSB epsilon A, the modified enzyme retained its capacity to hydrolyze substoichiometric ATP. (c) Inactivation of the ATPase by FSB epsilon A is accelerated by Pi. In each of the above characteristics, MF1 modified by FSB epsilon A resembles enzyme inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) more than it does enzyme inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylinosine (FSBI). Furthermore, prior inactivation of MF1 with FSBA completely prevents labeling of Tyr-alpha 244 with [3H]FSB epsilon A, whereas prior inactivation of the enzyme with FSBI does not. Since a single catalytic site is modified when FSBI inactivates MF1 whereas three noncatalytic sites are modified when it is maximally inactivated with FSBA, it is concluded that FSB epsilon A also modifies noncatalytic sites.",M1

The concomitant detection of IDP, together with ITP, and the absence of these peaks in nonclastogenic fractions and corresponding control fractions are arguments in favor of a biological relevance of these observations. The most important confirmation came from the clastogenic effect of commercial ITP and IDP added to the culture medium of the test cultures. The induction of chromatid type damage by these substances in lymphocytes exposed in the G0 phase of their cell cycle and the prevention of this damage by superoxide dismutase are analogous to the observations with CF.",M1

It is known that the fluorescence intensity of the complex is partially quenched by addition of ATP or Mg2+ and enhanced by ADP (Chang, T., and Penefsky, H. S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2746-2754). In the present study low concentrations of ATP (0.03 mM) induced a marked fluorescence quenching which was followed by a fast fluorescence recovery. This recovery could be prevented by EDTA or an ATP regenerating system. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the aurovertin-F1 complex and the reversal of the ATP-induced fluorescence quenching were determined in these various conditions. <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis also resulted in fluorescence quenching that was followed by a recovery of fluorescence intensity. Under conditions for single site catalysis, fluorescence quenching was observed upon the addition of ATP. This strongly indicates that fluorescence changes in the aurovertin-F1 complex are due to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP at a catalytic site. Therefore the resulting ADP molecule bound at this catalytic site possibly induces the fluorescence recovery observed.",M1
2523213,"Effect of citreoviridin and isocitreoviridin on beef heart mitochondrial ATPase.Citreoviridin is a toxic metabolite from fungus that has been shown to be an inhibitor of mitochondrial F1-ATPases. Studies of citreoviridin, however, have been compromised by the light-dependent isomerization that it undergoes. The isomerization is a potential source of extensive variability in the studies, if citreoviridin and isocitreoviridin have different kinetic effects and binding properties. Both citreoviridin and isocitreoviridin recently have been purified and have been shown to be stable in the dark. Using the purified isomers, the effects of both citreoviridin and isocitreoviridin on soluble and membrane-bound beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase activity were investigated. It was found that citreoviridin was an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis, and a non-competitive inhibitor of <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis catalyzed by soluble F1-ATPase. Isocitreoviridin had no effect on the hydrolysis of either of the triphosphates catalyzed by soluble F1-ATPase. The inhibition constant, Ki for citreoviridin was determined as 4.5 microM for ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition constants Kii and Kis for ITP hydrolysis were determined as 4.3 and 1.03 microM, respectively. Citreoviridin was an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis and a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP synthesis catalyzed by membrane-bound F1-ATPase. The inhibition constant, Ki, for ATP hydrolysis was around 4 microM. For ATP synthesis the inhibition constants were determined as 0.12 and 0.16 microM for Kis and Kii, respectively, when ADP concentration was kept saturating.

All the studied substrates of the Ca-pump provide Ca2+ accumulation inside the heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, the spontaneous Ca2+ outflux rate being different for different nucleoside triphosphates. It is only ATP that provides Ca-(caffeine)-induced Ca2+ release, however AMP, ADP, beta, gamma-methylene-ATP induce Ca2+ ejection in the presence of nonadenylic nucleotides. The ruthenium red (10(-7M) inhibits the induced ejection of Ca2+ from vesicles of the heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum, but does not prevent the spontaneous release of Ca2+ in the same concentrations. A conclusion is drawn that besides Ca-channels sensitive to Ca2+ and caffeine in the presence of ATP (or to AMP, ADP, beta, gamma-methylene-ATP in the presence of nonadenylic nucleotides) and possessing high sensitivity to the ruthenium red there is another pathway for Ca2+ in the heavy reticulum membranes along which its spontaneous release occurs after the substrate exhaustion.

Current models of adenylate cyclase activation require that guanyl nucleotide binding be enhanced by hormones, and we have examined this binding in rat luteal membrane preparations known to contain guanyl nucleotide-modulated hCG receptors. [3H] Guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GMPPnP), a nonhydrolyzable analog of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), was used to investigate binding to urea-washed, heavy rat luteal membranes. Binding was found to be linear, with respect to the amount of membranes added, in the range of 2-10 mg wet wt. tissue equivalents, and equilibrium was reached after a 30-min incubation at 30 degrees C. Analysis of equilibrium binding experiments gave a Ka of 1.2.10(7) +/- 0.9.10(7) M-1, with 460 +/- 430 fmol binding sites per mg tissue in the absence of hormone, Kinetic experiments showed an association rate constant of 2.6.10(5) +/- 0.5.10(5) M-1 min-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 1.8.10(-2) +/- 0.9.10(-2) min-1. In the presence of hCG, the Ka was unchanged; however, the number of binding sites increased by 50-120%. Competitive binding assays utilizing other nucleotides revealed that a hierarchy of GMPPnP = GTP greater than guanosine diphosphate (GDP) greater than inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) in displacing labeled GMPPnP. A similar hierarchy was also found for hCG-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (GMPPnP = GTP greater than ITP) and for modulation of hCG binding (GMPPnP greater than GTP greater than ITP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
2834368,"Factor-dependent transcription termination by vaccinia virus RNA polymerase. Evidence that the cis-acting termination signal is in nascent RNA.Transcription termination in vitro by vaccinia RNA polymerase is dependent on a trans-acting factor, VTF, that is associated with, if not identical to, the vaccinia mRNA capping enzyme. VTF-induced termination occurs approximately 50 nucleotides downstream of a signal sequence TTTTTNT in the non-transcribed templated strand; thus the cognate sequence UUUUUNU is expressed in the nascent RNA. To address the role of the nascent RNA in chain termination, the effects of nucleotide base analog substitutions were studied. Incorporation of bromo- (Br) UMP or iodo- (I) UMP into RNA abrogated factor-dependent termination without preventing the synthesis of read-through transcripts. Substitution of either <e>ITP</e> or 7'-methylguanosine for GTP did not inhibit factor-dependent termination, nor did the substitution of BrCTP or ICTP for CTP. The early transcripts synthesized in vitro were sensitive to RNase T2 but resistant to RNase H, indicating an absence of extensive hybridization of RNA product to the DNA template. Substitution of BrUTP for UTP did not alter the nuclease sensitivity of the transcripts, suggesting that increased stability of RNA:DNA hybrid structures did not account for the analog effects. These results are consistent with a model in which recognition of the primary sequence UUUUUNU in nascent RNA by the polymerase and/or VTF is required for transcription termination.",M1
2895769,"Trinitrophenyl-ATP and -ADP bind to a single nucleotide site on isolated beta-subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase. In vitro assembly of F1-subunits requires occupancy of the nucleotide-binding site on beta-subunit by nucleoside triphosphate.The stoichiometry of nucleotide binding to the isolated alpha- and beta-subunits of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase was investigated using two experimental techniques: (a) titration with fluorescent trinitrophenyl (TNP) derivatives of AMP, ADP, and ATP and (b) the centrifuge column procedure using the particular conditions of Khananshvili and Gromet-Elhanan (Khananshvili, D., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1985) FEBS Lett. 178, 10-14). Both procedures showed that alpha-subunit contains one nucleotide-binding site, confirming previous work. TNP-ADP and TNP-ATP bound to a maximal level of 1 mol/mol beta-subunit, consistent with previous equilibrium dialysis studies which showed isolated beta-subunit bound 1 mol of ADP or ATP per mol (Issartel, J. P., and Vignais, P. V. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 6591-6595). However, binding of only approximately 0.1 mol of ATP or ADP per mol of beta-subunit was detected using centrifuge columns. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that each of the alpha- and beta-subunits contains one nucleotide-binding domain. Because the subunit stoichiometry is alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon, this can account for the location of the six known nucleotide-binding sites in E. coli F1-ATPase. Studies of in vitro assembly of isolated alpha-, beta-, and gamma- subunits into an active ATPase showed that ATP, GTP, and <e>ITP</e> all supported assembly, with half-maximal reconstitution of ATPase occurring at concentrations of 100-200 microM, whereas ADP, GDP, and IDP did not. Also TNP-ATP supported assembly and TNP-ADP did not. The results demonstrate that (a) the nucleotide-binding site on beta-subunit has to be filled for enzyme assembly to proceed, whereas occupancy of the alpha-subunit nucleotide-binding site is not required, and (b) that enzyme assembly requires nucleoside triphosphate.",M1
2965918,"[Increased substrate selectivity during transition from Ca2+-activated to K+,EDTA-activated nucleoside triphosphatase activity of heavy meromyosin]A comparison of kinetic parameters (Km(app) and V) of hydrolysis by heavy meromyosin of natural (ATP and <e>ITP</e>) and modified nucleoside triphosphates showed that in the K+, EDTA-ATPase conformation the enzyme exhibited a higher selectivity towards the structure of the substrate nucleoside moiety than in the case of the Ca2+-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase activity. In the presence of Ca2+, all the N1- and N6-substituted analogs of ATP as well as ITP, etheno-ATP and the dialdehyde derivative of ATP were hydrolyzed at a high rate irrespective of their markedly decreased affinity for heavy meromyosin. In the presence of K+, EDTA the ATPase activity showed a tendency for a total decrease of the analog affinity for nucleoside triphosphates, i.e., the impossibility of tight binding of the substrate phosphate residues to the protein in the absence of bivalent cations, which was concomitant with an increase in the hydrolysis rate. However, it was found that only in N1-substituted analogs any appreciable changes in the substrate properties were absent. All the other nucleoside triphosphates tested (N6-carboxy-methoxy-ATP, N6-(N'-acetylaminoethoxy)-ATP, etheno-ATP, ITP and the dialdehyde derivative of ATP having a rupture in the ribose ring) lost their ability to be hydrolyzed by heavy meromyosin. The experimental results as well as the literature data are suggestive of differences in the spatial structure of the active center in two different myosin conformations associated with a high catalytic activity, i.e., K+, EDTA-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase.",M1
2956098,"Effects of arsenate on the Ca2+ ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.The effect of arsenate on the partial reactions of the catalytic cycle of the Ca2+ ATPase of skeletal muscle of sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied. With the use of native vesicles it was found that arsenate accelerates the rate of <e>ITP</e> hydrolysis and inhibits both Ca2+ or Sr2+ uptake. These effects were not observed when ATP was used as substrate or, with the use of ITP, when leaky vesicles were assayed. Activation of ITP hydrolysis is related to an increase of the enzyme's apparent affinity for ITP. Arsenate increases the steady-state level of the phosphoenzyme formed from ITP. This depends on the concentration of both Pi and Ca2+, in the medium. Ca2+ and Sr2+ efflux were accelerated by arsenate. The fast Ca2+ efflux promoted by arsenate is impaired by external Ca2+. Arsenate competes with Pi for the phosphorylating site of the enzyme.",M1
3663182,"Kinetics of hexokinase D ('glucokinase') with inosine triphosphate as phosphate donor. Loss of kinetic co-operativity with respect to glucose.When ATP, the normal phosphate donor for hexokinase D ('glucokinase'), is replaced by <e>ITP</e>, the positive co-operativity with respect to glucose disappears. This may be rationalized in relation to kinetic models for hexokinase D co-operativity, which assume that with the normal substrates the chemical reaction and subsequent release of products occur so rapidly that binding of substrates cannot approach equilibrium and is therefore not constrained by the thermodynamic requirement that the Hill coefficient for substrate binding cannot exceed the number of binding sites. ITP is a much poorer substrate than ATP, however: its Km value at high glucose concentrations is 24 times the value for ATP, whereas the value of the limiting rate V is decreased about 8-fold. Consequently it is no longer possible for the ternary complex to be converted into products rapidly enough to generate kinetic co-operativity. The negative co-operativity with respect to glucose observed in 2H2O with ATP as phosphate donor also disappears when ITP is used instead of ATP.",M1
2821285,"Mapping and characterization of transcriptional pause sites in the early genetic region of bacteriophage T7.During transcription of DNA templates in vitro, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase pauses at certain sequences before resuming elongation. Previous studies have established that some pausing events are brought about by the formation of RNA hairpin structures in the nascent transcript; however, it is not known whether this is an invariant and causal relationship. We have mapped and characterized almost 200 distinct pause sites located within the early region of bacteriophage T7 DNA using a collection of T7 deletion mutant DNAs and taking advantage of a procedure that permits synchronous transcription from the T7 A1 promoter. The pausing pattern is sensitive both to the overall concentration of nucleotide substrates and to the relative concentrations of the four nucleotides. The apparent Ks value for a particular nucleoside triphosphate can vary over a 500-fold range depending on the nucleotide sequence, and pausing at some sites can be induced by modest reductions in substrate concentrations. However, pausing is not solely a consequence of substrate limitation. Pausing at certain sites is caused by some feature of the template or of the transcript itself. Substitution of inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) for GTP during transcription strongly affects the pattern and strength of pausing events, suggesting that base-pairing interactions involving the RNA strand are important for some pausing events. Other pauses are determined by sequences downstream from the elongation site that have not yet been transcribed, and pausing at these sites is generally insensitive to substitution of IMP for GMP in the nascent transcript. Pausing at one particular site on T7 DNA is strongly enhanced by the presence of E. coli gene nusA protein. These results confirm that there are multiple classes of sites that lead to transcriptional pausing, and provide a collection of sites for further study. Using selected pause sites in the early region of T7 DNA, we have tried to evaluate the possible roles of primary sequence, base composition and secondary structure in pausing. Computer analysis was used to compare primary sequences and potential RNA hairpin structures in transcripts for pauses known to share similar biochemical properties. We see no correlation of pause sites with regions of particular base composition or with specific primary sequences. While some pauses are correlated with the potential to form stable RNA hairpins just upstream from the growing point of the RNA chain, there is not a strict one-to-one relationship between predicted RNA hairpins and the location of pause sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1

3759946,"Purification and characterization of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from the parasitic helminth Ascaris suum.Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been purified from homogenates of Ascaris suum muscle strips to apparent homogeneity as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification is a three-step procedure which yields pure enzyme in milligram quantities with good yield. The subunit molecular weight of the Ascaris enzyme is between 75,000 and 80,000. The native molecular weight is 83,000 as determined by gel filtration. The kinetic constants for substrates of the carboxylation reaction were determined and compared to those measured for the avian liver enzyme. From kinetic studies it appears likely that two separate roles for divalent metal ions exist in the catalytic process. Studies conducted with Mn2+ or with micromolar concentrations of Mn2+, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ suggest that Mn2+ but not Mg2+ binds directly to and activates the enzyme while either Mn2+ or Mg2+ may bind to the nucleotide resulting in the metal-nucleotide complex. The metal-nucleotide is the active form of the substrate for the reaction. In the presence of Mg2+, an increase in the Mn2+ concentration results in a decrease in the Km for P-enolpyruvate suggesting a direct role for Mn2+ stimulation and regulation of activity. The concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+ in Ascaris muscle strips were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and support the proposed hypothesis of a specific Mn2+ activation of the enzyme. The nucleotides ATP and <e>ITP</e> act as competitive inhibitors against GTP with KI values of 0.50 and 0.75 mM, respectively.

Proton translocation by resealed chromaffin-granule 'ghosts', measured by uptake of methylamine or by quenching of the fluorescence of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine, is supported by the hydrolysis of ATP or ITP, and inhibited by quercetin or alkylating agents, but not by vanadate.

6242244,"Relationships of inosine triphosphate and bicarbonate effects on F1 ATPase to the binding change mechanism.Two interesting previously reported properties of mitochondrial F1 ATPase have been confirmed and have been examined by 18O exchange measurements to assess if they are consistent with sequential participation of catalytic sites during ATP hydrolysis. These are the ability of HCO3- to increase reaction rate with apparent loss of cooperative interaction between subunits and the ability of <e>ITP</e> to accelerate the hydrolysis of a low concentration of ATP. The effect of HCO3- was tested at concentrations of ATP lower than previous measurements. The activation disappeared when ATP was reduced to 0.1 microM. The HCO3- activation at higher ATP concentrations did not change the extent of reversal of the cleavage of tightly bound ATP at the catalytic site, as measured by the average number of water oxygens incorporated with each Pi formed when 5 or 10 microM ATP is hydrolyzed. The data are consistent with sequential site participation with HCO3- acceleration of ADP departure after a binding change that stops 18O exchange and loosens ADP binding. When ITP concentration was lowered during net ITP hydrolysis by F1 ATPase an increase in water oxygen incorporation into Pi formed is observed, as noted previously for ATP hydrolysis. The acceleration of the cleavage of a constant low concentration of [gamma-18O]ATP by concomitant hydrolysis of increasing concentrations of ITP was accompanied by a decrease in water oxygen incorporation with each Pi formed from the ATP. These results add to evidence for the binding change mechanism for F1 ATPase with sequential participation of catalytic sites.",M1
6331205,"Protective role of adenine nucleotide translocase in O2-deficient hearts.At subsaturating concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA, the carnitine-dependent oxidation of the palmitoyl portion by uncoupled rat heart mitochondria was stimulated by ADP or ATP. This effect was traced to the prevention of acyl-CoA binding to adenine nucleotide translocase and the consequent sparing of acyl-CoA for acylcarnitine formation. Palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was stimulated by <e>ITP</e> also although ITP served neither as a transportable substrate nor as an inhibitor of ADP transport. ITP and other nontransportable nucleoside di(tri)phosphates prevented octanoyl-CoA binding to mitochondria. ITP was bound to mitochondria, and this binding was reversed by ADP, octanoyl-CoA, and carboxyatractyloside. Thus, besides a substrate site, there is a site on the translocase that binds nucleoside di(tri)phosphates, CoA and its esters, and atractylosides; inhibition of the translocase results, however, only from the binding of CoA esters of fatty acids and of atractylosides. We suggest that in O2-deficient hearts, when nucleotides decline and fatty acyl-CoA rises, the binding of the latter to the translocase becomes operational to slow fatty acylcarnitine production. By retarding the rise in amphipathic burden, this mechanism could protect heart against irreversible damage during brief periods of ischemia or hypoxia.",M1

For ATP hydrolysis, kcat/Km was independent of temperature in the presence or absence of D2O, while kcat/Km for ITP hydrolysis increased in both cases. The relative magnitudes of change of kcat and kcat/Km in the presence and absence of D2O over the temperature range studied were much different for the cases of ATP and ITP hydrolysis. A normal isotope effect was observed in plots of kcat H2O/kcat D2O versus temperature for ATP hydrolysis, which increased then leveled off as temperature increased.

The activated particles catalysed the biphasic hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system; the initial rapid phase was followed by a second, slower, phase in a time-dependent fashion. 4.

In contrast, this preparation contracts, even in the absence of Ca2+ (pCa 8-10), when ATP is replaced by ITP. Ca2+ dependency was not observed after increasing free Ca2+ concentrations from pCa 8.0 to 5.0, or after increasing MgITP concentration from 5 to 80 mM. On the other hand, rabbit skeletal muscle fiber treated by the same method as cardiac muscle demonstrates Ca2+ dependency in the presence of both MgITP and MgATP, although this Ca2+ regulation is less in the presence of MgITP. Loss of Ca2+ dependency was confirmed by the finding that, in contrast to ATPase, the ITPase activity of cardiac myofibrils was not dependent on Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore, the very fast tension responses (quick phases) following quick stretch and quick release were missing in MgITP, and the contractions were similar to rigor. These were not rigor however, because phosphate liberation from ITP continued, and muscle shortening occurred in MgITP. These findings suggest that MgITP dissociates the contraction mechanism from the regulatory mechanism, modulating the regulatory properties of cardiac muscle fiber.",M1

The specific aim of the study was to answer the following questions: i) Is the superprecipitation or the ATPase reaction sensitive to calcium ions even at very low concentrations of ATP? ii) Is tropomyosin required for calcium sensitivity? iii) Does  native  myosin B from gizzard muscle behave differently from  reconstituted  myosin B? iv) Does the troponin-tropomyosin complex of rabbit skeletal muscle act as a regulatory protein for the contractile activity of acto-phosphorylated myosin? Considering the overall time course of reaction rather than single values of activity, we found that the answers to the first three questions were negative, while that to the last question was positive. These results favor the kinase-phosphatase mechanism of calcium regulation rather than the leiotonin mechanism.",M1
6120123,"Activity of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase in fresh and stored human erythrocytes.The accumulation of inosine triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) in human erythrocytes incubated with inosine depends on the activity of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPH). High activity of this enzyme is accompanied by a low concentration of ITP and conversely. We showed that ITPH activity decreases with the prolongation of blood preservation time. As a consequence there is a lower accumulation of ITP in fresh erythrocytes incubated in a medium containing high concentrations of inosine, pyruvate and phosphate (IPP) than in red blood cells preserved at 4 degrees C. Synthesis of ITP in erythrocytes incubated in IPP medium being so intensive, it seems possible that during incubation an intermediate accumulates which decreases ITPH activity.",M1
7470442,"Initiation of reovirus transcription by inosine 5'-triphosphate and properties of 7-methylinosine-capped, inosine-substituted messenger ribonucleic acids.Inosine 5'-triphosphate (<e>ITP</e>) can be utilized in place of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) for both the initiation and the elongation steps of reovirus transcription, resulting in the synthesis of mRNAs containing 5'-terminal m7IpppIm and internal pI. The apparent molecular weights of the I-substituted products were altered as a consequence of the absence of G-C base pairs and accompanying loss of ordered structure. The migration of I-substituted RNAs in agarose gels and glycerol gradients was similar to glyoxal-treated transcripts; i.e., it decreased 2-fold as compared to the corresponding untreated G-containing mRNAs. 7-Methylinosine-capped (m7I-capped), I-substituted transcripts readily attached to wheat germ 80S ribosomes. Unlike native G-containing mRNAs, they also formed heavier complexes that sedimented faster than 80S complexes even in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPP(NH)P and elongation inhibitor sparsomycin. I-substituted molecules that were capped posttranscriptionally to form m7G-capped 5' ends yielded mostly 80S monosomes, consistent with a strong influence of 5'-terminal structure on initiation of translation. Under limited conditions of initiation, I-substituted RNAs outcompeted G-containing transcripts for ribosome attachment. Although the results are consistent with enhanced binding and freer movement of ribosomes on unstructured templates, synthesis of acid-precipitable polypeptides in wheat germ extract directed by I-substituted RNAs was 15-fold less than with G-containing mRNAs.",M1
7426631,"Effects of nucleoside triphosphates on choleragen-activated brain adenylate cyclase.To investigate the effects of nucleoside triphosphates on the activation of adenylate cyclase by choleragen and on the stability and catalytic function of the choleragen-activated enzyme, we treated samples of particulate preparation from bovine brain successively in three separate incubations with extensive washing between each step. In incubation I, choleragen and NAD were pesent to activte the adenylate cyclase. In incubation II, conditions were varied to assess enzyme stability. Finally, adenylate cyclase activity was assayed with ATP or adenylyl imidodiphosphate [App-(NH)p] as the substrate. Even when assays contained an optimal concentration of GTP, nucleoside triphosphate (plus a regenerating system) was required in incubation I for maximal choleragen activation; in order of effectiveness, GTP &gt; <e>ITP</e> &gt; ATP greater than or equal to CTP = UTP. During incubation II (at 30 degrees C), activity of the choleragen-treated fractions was essentially completely stable when 100 microM GTP (plus a regenerating system) was present. ITP and ATP were less effective. Activation produced by guanylyl imidodiphosphate was more stable than that resulting from choleragen, GTP, and NAD. After activation of membranes with choleragen, NAD, and GTP, nucleoside triphosphate plus a regenerating system (but not NAD or additional choleragen) was essential for expression of maximal activity. In order of effectiveness, GTP &gt; ITP &gt; ATP greater than or equal to CTP = UTP. It appears that GTP, which was effective in micromolar concentrations, plays an important role not only in the activation of adenylate cyclase by choleragen but also in the stabilization and expression of the catalytic function of the activated enzyme.",M1

The enzyme has an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.1, a native molecular weight of 67 000 +/- 3000 and a subunit weight of 34 000 +/- 400. A number of divalent metal ions can substitute for Mg2+ in the enzyme reaction in decreasing order Mn2+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt; Co2+ &gt; Ca2+. In the presence of excess Mg2+, nucleotides do not affect the Km for fructose 6-phosphate with a value of 0.042 mM. The order of efficiency for nucleotides to act as phosphoryl donors is ATP &gt; <e>ITP</e> &gt; GTP &gt; UTP &gt; CTP. This remains unchanged in the presence of excess Mn2+, but V is increased 2.4-fold with ATP. A 2 : 1 ratio of Mn2+/nucleotide 5'-triphosphate produced an equivalent dissociation constant of 1.1 mM for all nucleotides, which was markedly decreased at a high Mn2+ level. The rate of enzyme catalysis was found to be dependent on the concentration of MnATP2-. Mn2+ at non-limiting values does affect the binding of fructose 6-phosphate to the enzyme.",M1

A crossover in the metabolite profile of the glycolytic intermediates occurs between fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, suggesting either inhibition of phosphofructokinase or activation of fructose diphosphatase, or both. Direct assay of the enzymes in cell-free extracts of the hepatocytes indicates that dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibits phosphofructokinase but has no effect upon fructose diphosphatase. The assay for phosphofructokinase was modified by the use of <e>ITP</e> in place of ATP for the phosphate donor as the ATP-linked assay is complicated by an apparent time-dependent activation of the enzyme. These findings strongly suggest that cyclic AMP inhibition of phosphofructokinase explains in part cyclic AMP inhibition of aerobic glycolysis and lipogenesis by rat liver hepatocytes.",M1

Transient kinetic studies.The rate of phosphorylation of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by <e>ITP</e> and ATP was studied using a millisecond mixing and quenching device. The rate of phosphorylation was slower when the vesicles were preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium than when preincubated with Ca2+, regardless of the substrate used and of the pH of the medium. When the vesicles were preincubated with Ca2+ at pH 7.4 an overshoot of phosphorylation was observed in the presence of ITP. The overshoot was abolished when the pH of the medium was decreased to 6.0 or when the vesicles were preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium. Using vesicles preincubated with Ca2+ the apparent Km for ITP found was 2.5 mM at pH 6.0 and 1.0 mM at pH 7.4. The Vmax observed (77 mumol g-1 s-1) did not change with the pH of the medium. Both at pH 6.0 and 7.4 the apparent Km for ATP was 3 microM when preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium. At pH 6.0 the Vmax for ATP varied from 96 to 33 mumol g-1 s-1 depending on whether the vesicles were preincubated in the presence or absence of Ca2+. At pH 7.4 the Vmax for ATP was 90 mumol g-1 s-1 in both conditions. The rate of phosphorylation of the vesicles was dependent on the relative Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations of the reaction medium regardless of the substrate used.",M1

The main advantages are a better tridimensional view and an increased versatility of the surgical instruments. The DaVinci system allows an accurate dissection around the splenic hilum and preservation of the splenic remnant vessels in partial splenectomy. Robotic splenectomy will probably not replace the laparoscopic splenectomy for the most common indications like <e>ITP</e>, hemolytic anemia. It may be a very useful surgical tool in difficult splenectomy: partial splenectomy, splenectomy in liver cirrhosis, splenic tumors or malignant hemopathies. In these cases the robotic approach may shorten the operative time, decrease the blood loss and the risk of remorrhagic complications during surgery and even make possible a minimally invasive splenectomy very difficult to be performed by classical laparoscopy.",M2
20405514,"Predictors of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.BACKGROUND: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematological disorder with heterogeneous manifestation and unpredictable outcome. This study reviewed the pattern of presentation and response to therapy in patients with <e>ITP</e>, in order to identify risk factors for chronic disease. PROCEDURE: The study included all patients diagnosed as ITP between January 1998 and December 2007. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of the patients had acute and 34.9% had chronic ITP. Patients with chronic ITP had a higher mean age at diagnosis (P = 0.0000003). Females more than 10 years of age were more susceptible than males to follow a chronic course (P = 0.031). Febrile illness preceded the onset of ITP in 167 patients, 76.0% of them had an acute course (P = 0.000037). Moderate and severe bleeding occurred in 11.34% and 7.27% of the patients, respectively. Fifty-four patients (15.7%) improved without any specific treatment. Corticosteroids were used as a first-line treatment in 209 patients and showed a total response of 76.6% compared to 85.7% and 84% for IVIG and anti-D immunoglobulin treated patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The most relevant risk factors for the development of chronic ITP included a gradual mode of onset of symptoms over more than 2 weeks period, initial platelet count &gt;20 x 10(9)/L, and age more than 10 years at presentation.",M2
20404751,"The association of oxidant status and antioxidant capacity in children with acute and chronic <e>ITP</e>.PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to investigate oxidant and antioxidant systems in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). With this purpose, we measured the levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), and other oxidative stress parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two pediatric patients with ITP (25 acute, 27 chronic) and 21 healthy children were included in the study. Patients with acute ITP were studied, before and after, methylprednisolone treatment. RESULTS: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and TAC were statistically significantly lower in patients with acute ITP before treatment than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, in this group, MDA, TOS levels, and OSI (oxidative stress index) were found to be higher than those in the control group. In chronic ITP group, although hemoglobin hematocrit, platelet counts, and TAC levels were statistically significantly lower than those in the control groups,the mean platelet volume, MDA, TOS, and OSI were found to be statistically significantly higher (P&lt;0.05). Platelet count and mean platelet volume values were statistically significantly lower in patients with acute ITP before treatment than after treatment (P&lt;0.05). We also found a positive correlation between thrombocyte count and TAC, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001). A negative correlation was found between thrombocyte count and serum MDA levels, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001). We also found a negative correlation between thrombocyte count and serum OSI, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001). A negative correlation was found between thrombocyte count and TOS, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, increased MDA, TOS and OSI, and decreased TAC levels were found in patients with acute and chronic ITP.

METHOD: Adults presenting with immune thrombocytopaenia over a 7-year period were identified from a database. Written and electronic case records were reviewed. Patient demographics, results of investigations and management were recorded and compared with international guidelines. RESULTS: <e>ITP</e> was mild or asymptomatic in 57 of 67 patients (85%). Bone marrow aspiration was performed in 45 patients including 23 of 45 patients under 60 yrs. 15 patients (22%) were tested for HIV at presentation. 28 patients (42%) were inpatients including 18 patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. 53 patients (79%) received first-line treatment with oral prednisone including 6 who were asymptomatic with platelets &gt;30x10(9)/L. Splenectomy was performed in 17 patients at a median 7 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Guidelines were followed in most cases although bone marrow aspirates were often performed unnecessarily in young patients. HIV testing was infrequently requested and should be considered in all new patients presenting with ITP. Asymptomatic patients have a low risk of serious or life-threatening bleeding and do not require admission to hospital.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:The investigation included 12 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and 10 with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). Blood was received at a Bishkek hospital, then on days 20 and 40 of stay in the mountains. The authors studied erythropoietin (EPO) by enzyme immunoassay (Protein Contour kit, Russia), serum ferritin (SF) by immunoradioassay (Immunotech kit, Czech Republic), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), homocysteine (HC), hepcidin, endothelin (ET), and thrombomodulin (TM) by sandwich enzyme immunoassay, by applying monospecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies against relevant antigens (IDG Int Inc, USA). RESULTS: On staying in the mountains, there was a gradual increase in the content of hemoglobin in patients with AA and ITP. On day 40, in keeping with higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels, both groups showed a decrease in HIF-1alpha concentrations to the normal values (from 8.2 to 4.5 pg/ml). Due to the anemic syndrome, baseline EPO was increased by 5-7 times in the patients from both groups. On days 20-40, the content of EPO showed a 1.3-2.5-fold increase. In AA, HC was almost 3 times greater than the normal values; in ITP, it was 1.5-fold increased. On day 20 and during the patients'stay in the mountains, the level of HC remained in the normal range in both groups. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic hypoxia positively affects a number of hematological parameters, by normalizing erythropoiesis (Hb, EPO, and HIF-1alpha), iron metabolism (SF), and the coagulation system (HC, ET, and TM).",M2

The present study aims to report a peculiar form of previously unreported focal dermal atrophy. METHODS: We studied over a period of 5 years a boy who manifested, since birth, multiple hypopigmented cutaneous atrophic lesions of the atrophoderma type in a mosaic distribution over the body and the legs. RESULTS: This boy did no develop other cutaneous or systemic stigmata except for an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) manifested at age 2 years. Full serum, metabolic and infective analyses; full ophthalmological examination; ultrasound examination of the heart and internal organs; skeletal x-rays; brain magnetic resonance imaging; and DNA analysis of the PORCN (Focal Dermal Hypoplasia - FDH) gene in this boy yielded normal results. Pathological analysis of multiple skin specimens from an affected area revealed slightly reduced dermal thickness; hyperpigmentation of the basal layer; homogenized and disarrayed collagen bundles; perivascular chronic infiltrates of lymphocytes and histiocytes; and normal skin appendages. Currently, the child is healthy; he has mildly improved skin status with less-evident skin depression throughout the lesion areas and no further complication has been recorded. The histological and clinical appearance of the skin lesions and the course were against any known disorder in the group of the atrophodermas.

Although randomized clinical trials are lacking, the cumulative data would suggest that rituximab has a beneficial role in their treatment. Response to B-cell-depleting therapy is actually associated with a significant decrease of circulating autoantibodies. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the T-cell compartment may also be modulated by these interventions.

It has been hailed as one of the most important therapeutic developments of the decade. While transient peripheral B cell depletion is common after rituximab therapy, immunoglobulin levels are generally not affected. This is because CD20 is expressed on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Two adult patients with pre-existing primary antibody deficiency who presented with recurrent infections immediately following rituximab use for the treatment of refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) are described. Both were previously treated with various immunosuppressive agents without any notable infective problems. However, a few weeks after treatment with rituximab, these patients presented with clinically significant immunodeficiency requiring intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This striking temporal relationship between rituximab administration and onset of infections suggests that rituximab has accelerated the presentation of immune deficiency in these patients.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are important to understand the medical and public health impact of the disease. To critically review all published reports on the incidence of ITP in children and adults, all articles identified on the Medline database (searched January 1, 1966-August 7, 2009) that reported data on the incidence of ITP were retrieved. Articles which directly estimated the incidence of ITP were selected for review. Eight articles reported the incidence of acute ITP in children. After review, four were determined to have the strongest estimates, based on the method of patient identification and study design. The lowest incidence estimate in these four studies was 2.2 per 10(5) children/year (95% confidence interval 1.9, 2.4) and the highest incidence estimate was 5.3 per 10(5) children/year (95% confidence interval 4.3, 6.4). Three studies reported the incidence of ITP in adults. The estimate from the article with the strongest methodology reported an incidence estimate of 3.3 per 10(5) adults/year.

One hundred three patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg/d dexamethasone for 4 days with or without 375 mg/m(2) rituximab weekly for 4 weeks. Patients who were refractory to dexamethasone alone received salvage therapy with dexamethasone plus rituximab. Sustained response (ie, platelet count &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)/L at month 6 after treatment initiation), evaluable in 101 patients, was greater in patients treated with dexamethasone plus rituximab (n = 49) than in those treated with dexamethasone alone (n = 52; 63% vs 36%, P = .004, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.079-0.455).

The long-term management of many patients with chronic ITP is unsatisfactory, largely due to the variable efficacy and risks of severe adverse effects associated with current treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To estimate patients' benefit-risk preferences for treatments for ITP. METHODS: Patients' adverse event risk tolerance and the levels of benefit required to offset possible risks were evaluated using choice-format conjoint analysis. Subjects chose between pairs of hypothetical treatment alternatives defined by probability of achieving safe platelet levels, need for corticosteroids, mode of administration, risk of rebound, risk of elevated liver enzyme levels, and risk of thromboembolism. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that patients have clear and measurable benefit-risk preferences that physicians should consider when discussing treatment options with their patients. Patients were willing to accept significant risks of adverse events in return for an increase in the probability of achieving safe platelet levels, to avoid corticosteroids, and for more convenient administration. Patients were willing to accept significant risks of rebound and elevated liver enzymes for improvements in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that patients with ITP are willing to accept treatment-related risks in exchange for improvements in treatment efficacy and administration attributes and suggest the importance of considering a patient's benefit-risk preferences during discussions of therapeutic options.",M2

20113906,"Childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura: diagnosis and management.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low circulating platelet count caused by destruction of antibody-sensitized platelets in the reticuloendothelial system. ITP can be classified as childhood versus adult, acute versus chronic, and primary versus secondary. Persistence of thrombocytopenia defines the chronic form of the disorder. Secondary causes of ITP include collagen vascular disorders, immune deficiencies, and some chronic infections. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of children who have acute and chronic ITP. Emphasis is placed on areas of controversy and new therapies.",M2
20113630,"[Expression of T-bet and GATA3 in children with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of transcriptional factors T-bet and GATA3 mRNA and the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in blood in children with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) and investigate the tendency of polarization of Th1/Th2 in children with ITP. METHODS: Blood T-bet and GATA3 mRNA expression were examined using RT-PCR and plasma IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels were measured using EIASA in children with acute ITP in acute (n=30) and remission stages (n=28). Twenty healthy children served as the controls. RESULTS: Blood T-bet mRNA expression and IFN-gamma levels in children with ITP in the acute stage were markedly higher than those in the remission stage and controls (p&lt;0.01). In contrast, blood GATA3 mRNA expression and IL-4 levels in children with ITP in the acute stage were significantly lower than those in the remmission stage and controls (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The high expression of T-bet and IFN-gamma and the low expression of GATA3 and IL-4 indicate the existence of Th1 polarization in children with acute ITP. This might be related to the regulation of T-bet and GATA3.",M2

METHODS: Papers related to the relationship between human parvovirus B19 infection and childhood ITP published between 1994 and 2008 were retrieved electronically from the Chinese Journals Full-text Database and the Wanfang Data. These relevant papers on case-control trials were statistically studied by meta analysis. RESULTS: Eight papers that met the inclusion criteria were included for this meta analysis. Five hundred and sixteen cases of childhood ITP and 246 healthy controls were enrolled. The meta analysis showed that the incidence of human parvovirus B19 infection in the ITP group was significantly higher than that in the control group (OR=13.71, 95% CI=7.07-26.59, Z=7.75, p&lt;0.01).

20100010,"The expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4, Foxp3 and perforin genes are not correlated with DNA methylation status in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.We investigated the relationship between the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4, Foxp3 and perforin gene and the methylation status of their promoters in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) patients. Gene expression and DNA methylation were determined by quantitative PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing, respectively. The expression of IFN-gamma was higher, while the expression of IL-4 was notably lower in ITP patients when compared with the controls. Most importantly, the Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) was remarkably higher in ITP patients, showing that the ITP patients were mainly in the Th1 polarization response. Although the methylation rate of CpGs located at -409 of perforin was higher (p = 0.0376) and that of IFN-gamma were relatively higher (p = 0.0582) in ITP, we did not find the negative correlation between the expression of those genes and the methylation of their promoters.",M2
20100009,"Single nucleotide polymorphism in the methyl-CpG binding domain 4 gene and the risk for immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Chinese population.Epigenetics might contribute to autoimmune diseases including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) plays an important role in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The polymorphism of the MBD4 gene may influence MBD4 activity on gene expression profiles, thereby influencing individual susceptibility to ITP. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the association between the MBD4 polymorphism and the risk for ITP in the Chinese population. The polymorphism of MBD4 rs140693 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). In this study, there was no significant difference in genotype and alleles distribution between the ITP patients and the controls. Similar results were observed between the two groups when stratified by age and disease course including acute childhood, chronic childhood, acute adult and chronic adult. In the conclusion, MBD4 polymorphism may not be a stratification marker to predict the susceptibility to ITP, at least in Chinese population.",M2
20096011,"Comparison of intravenous immune globulin and high dose anti-D immune globulin as initial therapy for childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura.This report documents our experience with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (1 g/kg, iv) and high-dose, anti-D immune globulin (anti-D) (75 microg/kg) as initial treatment for childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). The medical records of children diagnosed with ITP at a single institution between January 2003 and May 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Participants received either IVIG or high-dose anti-D immune globulin as their initial treatment for ITP. For the 53 patients included for analysis, there was no statistical difference in efficacy between each group; however, patients who received anti-D experienced a higher rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), particularly chills and rigours, and 2 of 24 patients in the anti-D group developed severe anaemia requiring medical intervention. Patients who presented with mucosal bleeding had higher rates of treatment failure (32%) compared to those who presented with dry purpura (6%), regardless of treatment. Both IVIG and high-dose anti-D are effective first-line therapies for childhood ITP. However, we observed increased ADRs in the high-dose anti-D group in contrast to previously published reports. Further studies are needed to evaluate safety and premedications for high-dose anti-D and to determine the utility of using the presence of mucosal bleeding to predict treatment failure.",M2
20088841,"Improved mouse models for the study of treatment modalities for immune-mediated platelet destruction.BACKGROUND: We found when using a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) that platelet (PLT) nadir could not be maintained in the face of daily PLT antibody, making interpretation of treatment modalities difficult. This finding was documented to be at least in part due to increased thrombopoiesis as a result of a compensated thrombocytolytic state. Thus, it was important to develop an improved mouse model of human ITP so as to maintain PLT nadir over time. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To maintain PLT nadir, we have developed two mouse models. One model uses single-dose sublethal total body gamma irradiation (TBI) in combination with daily low-dose PLT antibody administration while the second model uses escalation of the dose of PLT antibody over time. Both models maintain PLT nadir and allow for the study of treatment modalities without interference by marrow compensation. RESULTS: Surprisingly, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) shows no efficacy when using the TBI combination model but works well using the dose-escalation mouse model. In contrast, anti-TER-119 shows efficacy using either mouse model. Our results indicate that the mechanism of action of IVIG requires a functional marrow and/or involves a radiosensitive regulatory cell. However, IVIG works using the dose-escalation model without TBI and the increase in PLT counts correlates directly with reticulated PLTs suggesting that the IVIG mechanism involves effects on megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: These mouse models should be useful for investigators wishing to maintain PLT nadir over prolonged periods of time for the study of mechanism and efficacy of various treatments for ITP.",M2
20079208,"[Short term high-dose dexamethasone therapy in previously untreated idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]OBJECTIVE: To observe the long-term effect of short interim high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM)in previously untreated patients affected by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura(<e>ITP</e>) and investigate the action of maintenance treatment. METHODS: 40 mg/d of dexamethasone was given in a 4-day pulse every 14 days for 3 cycles to 45 patients with ITP. Among them, 22 cases were given routinely dexamethasone of 0.035 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for maintenance treatment between courses of high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM + RM group)and 23 cases were given dexamethasone of 0.035 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) only when the platelet count was lower than 20 x 10(9)/L (HD-DXM + SM group). As a control group, another 22 cases were given routine dosage of prednisone (control group). RESULTS: (1) At the end of the third cycle, the effective rate in the HD-DXM + RM group was 81.8% (18/22), which was higher than 65.2% (15/23) of the HD-DXM + SM group and 63.6% (14/22) of the control group. (2) Among the HD-DXM group patients, the effective rate at the end of the third cycle was higher than that at the end of first and second cycles. (3) The effective rate of HD-DXM + RM group was higher than that of HD-DXM + SM group. (4) At the time of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after the end of the last cycle of HD-DXM, the relapse rates in HD-DXM + RM group were 16.7%, 16.7%, 27.8% and 33.3% respectively, which were lower than that of HD-DXM + SM group and control group respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A schedule of 3 cycles of HD-DXM pulses with an interval of 2 weeks between cycles is an effective method for previously untreated ITP patients and maintenance treatment with small-dose dexamethasone between high-dose dexamethasone contributes to improve the long-term curative effect.",M2

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 247 children with newly diagnosed ITP between April 1991 and March 2006 who visited one of the 12 hospitals belonging to the Kyoto University Pediatric Hematologic Study Group. 180 and 67 cases were classified as the acute type and as the chronic type, respectively. Older age, higher initial platelet count, positive medical history or concomitant medical diagnosis, the absence of preceding infection or vaccination, and the absence of an increase in immunoglobulin were risk factors for the chronicity. The prognostic factors in chronic ITP were evaluated in 53 patients after excluding patients receiving splenectomy or having insufficient follow-up data. The overall time required for 50% resolution in patients with chronic ITP was approximately 5.6 years. Age at presentation of less than 3 years and higher platelet counts at the time of chronic ITP diagnosis were good prognostic factors. On the other hand, gender, initial platelet counts, and preceding infection or vaccination were not associated with the prognosis.",M2
20046527,"Cerebellar nocardiosis and myopathy from long-term corticosteroids for idiopathic thrombocytopenia.Infection of the central nervous system with Nocardia sp. usually manifests as supratentorial abscesses. Supratentorial and cerebellar abscesses from infection with Nocardia sp. following immunosuppression with long-term corticosteroids for idiopathic thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) have not been reported. An 83 years-old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative, polymorbid male with ITP for which he required corticosteroids since age 53 years developed tiredness, dyspnoea, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and progressive gait disturbance. Imaging studies of the lung revealed an enhancing tumour in the right upper lobe with central and peripheral necrosis, multiple irregularly contoured hyperdensities over both lungs, and right-sided pleural effusions. Sputum culture grew Nocardia sp. Neurological diagnostic work-up revealed dysarthria, dysphagia, ptosis, hypoacusis, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, proximal weakness of the lower limbs, diffuse wasting, and stocking-type sensory disturbances. The neurological deficits were attributed to an abscess in the upper cerebellar vermis, myopathy from corticosteroids, and polyneuropathy. Meropenem for 37 days and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole for 3 months resulted in a reduction of the pulmonary, but not the cerebral lesions. Therefore, sultamicillin was begun, but without success. Long-term therapy with corticosteroids for ITP may induce not only steroid myopathy but also immune-incompetence with the development of pulmonary and cerebral nocardiosis. Cerebral nocardiosis may not sufficiently respond to long-term antibiotic therapy why switching to alternative antibiotics or surgery may be necessary.",M2

20043468,"Eltrombopag for the treatment of chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura.PURPOSE: On November 20, 2008, eltrombopag (Promacta) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. This report summarizes the FDA analyses of the clinical data supporting this approval. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, an uncontrolled extension study, and exploratory supportive studies. One study randomized patients among placebo or one of three daily doses of eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg). The other study randomized patients between placebo or eltrombopag, 50 mg daily. Study drugs were administered for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was response rate. Patients who completed these and other studies were eligible to enroll in the extension study. RESULTS: Overall, 231 patients were randomized within the two controlled studies (67 to placebo; 164 to eltrombopag). A platelet response was observed among 59% and 70% of the patients receiving eltrombopag, 50 mg daily. Corresponding placebo response rates were 16% and 11%, respectively. Serious hemorrhages occurred among two patients receiving eltrombopag and one patient receiving placebo, and among five patients following discontinuation of eltrombopag. In the extension study, eltrombopag was administered to 109 patients; median platelet counts were &gt; 50 x 10(9)/L throughout the study's quarterly follow-up points. Major safety findings pertained to a risk for hepatotoxicity, worsened thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage following eltrombopag discontinuation, and bone marrow reticulin formation. CONCLUSIONS: The US FDA approved eltrombopag for use among certain patients with chronic ITP based upon demonstration of a favorable risk-to-benefit profile, where the major benefit pertained to demonstration of a clinically important increase in blood platelets among a population of patients relatively refractory to prior therapies.",M2
20031296,"Evans' syndrome in pregnancy: a systematic literature review and two new cases.Evans' syndrome, the coexistence of immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), is rare in pregnancy, with a few published cases. Concerns about the teratogenic effect of pharmacological agents used in the management of Evans' syndrome limit the treatment options in pregnancy. In this paper we performed a systematic review of the literature of all published cases with Evans' syndrome in pregnancy and we report two new cases. The review was performed by searching the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google scholar up to the end of December 2008. The selection criteria were Evans' syndrome in pregnancy; autoimmune haemolytic anaemia; immune thrombocytopenia. Thirteen papers reporting 14 pregnancies in women with Evans' syndrome have been published: 7 papers are written in English. Evans' syndrome can be diagnosed with a full blood count, film and Coombs testing. It runs a more benign course in pregnancy than in non-pregnant state (notably neutropenia does not occur) and very often resolves post-delivery. The fetal outcome may be less favourable: a minority of fetuses are affected by transplacental passage of antibody and have a significant morbidity and mortality. With appropriate treatment, women with Evans' syndrome can have successful pregnancies, with a good response to conventional treatment. More detailed studies of Evans' syndrome in pregnancy, especially of fetal outcome, are required.",M2
20030171,"[Comparison between two methods for the measurement reticulated platelet and their clinical significance--flow cytometry (FCM) method and IPF method Using automated hematology analyzer (XE-2000)]Reticulated platelet (RP) is thought to be a useful marker for differential diagnosis and analysis of platelet kinetics in patients with thrombocytopenia. In this study, we compared two methods for the measurement of RP: flow cytometric (FCM) method and immature platelet fraction (IPF) method using automated hematology analyzer (XE-2000). There was a relatively good correlation between RP% measured by FCM method and IPF% measured by IPF method in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) (Y = 0.806X-0.050, r = 0.634, p &lt; 0.001). We then measured RP% and IPF% in 61 patients with ITP and 27 patients with aplastic anemia (AA). For the differential diagnosis for ITP, the sensitivity (82%) and specificity (93%) of FCM method were better than those of IPF method (sensitivity 67% and specificity 63%). Our data demonstrate the significant difference between two methods by analyzing clinical samples in parallel.",M2
20029174,"Management of chronic childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura: AIEOP consensus guidelines.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The management of chronic childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is distinct from acute ITP. Similar to the publication on acute ITP guidelines, the AIEOP (Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica) considered it appropriate to develop consensus guidelines for chronic childhood ITP to provide useful and shared information for physicians, healthcare professionals, parents and patients. DESIGN/METHODS: A preliminary, evidence-based document issued by a select group of AIEOP pediatric hematologists was discussed, modified and approved during a Consensus Conference according to procedures previously validated by the AIEOP Board. Results: The guidelines give prominence to the periodical reevaluation of all the etiological hypotheses of thrombocytopenia in relation to its clinical condition. The majority of chronic ITP children do not require treatment, especially if bleeding is absent or minimal. The treatment decision depends on several factors other than the platelet count, and treatment options are suggested in relation to the therapeutic scenarios. Recommendations are given regarding support for surgery, particular hemorrhagic conditions, daily activities/sports, as well as for vaccines and drugs. Experimental treatments are also discussed.",M2

20007808,"A murine model of severe immune thrombocytopenia is induced by antibody- and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses that are differentially sensitive to therapy.Immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) is a bleeding disorder characterized by antibody-opsonized platelets being prematurely destroyed in the spleen, although some patients with ITP may have a cell-mediated form of thrombocytopenia. Although several animal models of ITP have been developed, few mimic primary chronic ITP nor have any shown cell-mediated platelet destruction. To create this type of model, splenocytes from CD61 knockout mice immunized against CD61(+) platelets were transferred into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) (CD61(+)) mouse recipients, and their platelet counts and phenotypes were observed. As few as 5 x 10(4) splenocytes induced a significant thrombocytopenia and bleeding mortality (80%) in recipients within 3 weeks after transfer. Depletion of lymphocyte subsets before transfer showed that the splenocyte's ability to induce thrombocytopenia and bleeding completely depended on CD4(+) T helper cells and that both CD19(+) B cell (antibody)- and CD8(+) T cell (cell)-mediated effector mechanisms were responsible. Treatment of the SCID mouse recipients with intravenous gamma-globulins raised platelet counts and completely prevented bleeding mortality induced by antibody-mediated effector mechanisms but did not affect cell-mediated disease. This novel model not only shows both antibody- and cell-mediated ITP and bleeding but also suggests that these 2 effector mechanisms have a differential response to therapy.",M2
20000868,"Association between drug and vaccine use and acute immune thrombocytopenia in childhood: a case-control study in Italy.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is an immunomediated disease characterized by a decrease in platelet count and, in its more severe forms, by bleeding symptoms. Many drugs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in adults; only limited data on drug-related ITP in children have been published. Our study was set up to evaluate the consistency of the association between drug and vaccine use and ITP in children. This study is part of an Italian multicentre study on adverse drug reactions in children, coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health, which was started in November 1999 and is ongoing. The study was conducted by enrolling all children aged more than 1 month who were hospitalized through the paediatric emergency department for the following conditions: thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100 x 103/L); acute neurological disorders; non-infectious mucocutaneous diseases and vasculitis; and endoscopically confirmed gastroduodenal lesions and/or clinically defined haematemesis and melaena. Children with chronic pathologies or concomitant diagnoses of cancer or immunodeficiency were not included in our study. During hospital admission, a physician interviewed parents using a structured questionnaire. The main aim of the interview was to collect information on drug exposure in a time period of 3 weeks and vaccine exposure in a period of 6 weeks preceding hospitalization. Using a case-control study design, exposure of children with thrombocytopenia (cases) to drugs and vaccines was compared with similar exposure of children with gastroduodenal lesions and neurological disorders (controls); this allowed us to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia associated with the use of drugs or vaccines. Up to December 2007, the study population included 387 cases of thrombocytopenia and 1924 controls. Despite the low platelet count, ITP was generally a mild disease, without serious bleeding in the majority of cases and associated with a short length of hospital stay. After adjusting for concurrent use of other drugs, use of the antibacterials was associated with a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of developing ITP (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.8, 3.1). Mucolytics and NSAIDs were associated with an OR of 1.9; 95% CI 1.2, 2.9 and 1.5; 95% CI 1.0, 2.1 respectively, while paracetamol (acetaminophen) was associated with an OR of 1.5; 95% CI 1.2, 2.0. MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of developing ITP (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2, 4.7). The results of this study provide evidence for an association between ITP and exposure to selected antibacterials, NSAIDs, paracetamol, mucolytics and MMR vaccination.",M2

19968458,"Impact of <e>ITP</e> on physician visits and workplace productivity.OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) on primary care and specialist visits and workplace productivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study comparing ITP patients to age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects completed a one-time web-based survey, which included questions on work loss, work productivity, and physician visits. ITP patients and controls were compared on these outcomes. For ITP patients, the relationship between work-related issues and physician visits with clinical characteristics (time since diagnosis, platelet count, number of treatments received, and an ITP-specific health-related quality of life measure, the ITP-PAQ) was explored. RESULTS: A total of 1002 ITP patients and 1031 controls completed the survey. On average, ITP patients were 46 years old, diagnosed 9 years ago, and had platelet counts of 148 x 10(9)/L; 37% had undergone splenectomy. More ITP patients had primary care (20% vs. 11%) and specialist (28% vs. 11%) visits in the past month versus controls (p &lt; or = 0.001). Higher proportions of ITP patients have ever taken sick leave (56% vs. 30%), and missed chore hours in the past week (18% vs. 13%) (p &lt; or = 0.003). ITP patients scored significantly worse than controls on all six work productivity items. Patients diagnosed within the past year were more likely to have specialist visits and to miss chore hours versus those diagnosed less recently. Worse ITP-PAQ scores and more ITP-related treatments were related to more physician visits and worse work-related and productivity outcomes. Platelet count is not associated with these outcomes. The study is limited by the potential for biased samples due to recruitment approaches, the inherent issues of a cross-sectional study design and recall bias in questionnaire responses. CONCLUSIONS: ITP was consistently associated with more physician visits and worse work and productivity outcomes. Future research should build on these findings by calculating a comprehensive cost-of-illness of ITP including both direct and indirect costs.",M2

The authors reviewed data of 1,840 patient with ITP, from 5 pediatric hematology centers in Egypt from 1997 to 2007, to study the incidence and risk factors of ICH. Ten cases of ICH were identified with a median age at presentation of 7.5 years; 4 patients had acute ITP, 2 persistent and 4 chronic. The platelet count was &lt;10 x 10(9)/l in 7 cases, and only 1 patient had a history of head trauma. Seven children were on treatment prior to or at the time of occurrence of ICH and all were treated by pharmacotherapy. Two children died shortly afterwards due to late referral to a specialized center. Our results suggest that treatment does not prevent ICH and that it can occur at any time during the course of the disease. Delayed referral can be considered a risk factor for unfavorable outcome of ICH, highlighting the importance of teaching sessions for patients and their parents to minimize subsequent morbidity and mortality of ICH in children with ITP.",M2
19954101,"Efficacy and safety of laparoscopic splenectomy: review of 14 adult cases using the lateral approach.BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic splenectomy has advantages over conventional surgery mainly related to the smaller incision, less postoperative pain and shorter recovery period. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of patients with diseases of the spleen managed by elective laparoscopic splenectomy. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical charts was performed of patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy by a single surgeon during a three year period. Patient demographics, diagnosis and outcomes including operative time, weight of the specimens, blood loss, operative complications, length of stay, and long term outcome with platelet counts in Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (<e>ITP</e>) were reviewed. Data on the presence of an accessory spleens, and need for use of hand assist devices was reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy; 9 (nine) for Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP); one for Evans Syndrome, one for splenic artery aneurysm, two for suspected lymphoma and one for suspected metastatic disease. Ages were 22 to 70 years (mean 46.6). All patients underwent surgery in a full lateral position. Eight specimens were morcellated for removal and 6 were removed intact; 4 using a hand assist device and two by extending one of the port incisions. In 10 patients, total laparoscopic splenectomy was completed; four patients required use of a hand assist device due to difficulty with the operation. Mean spleen weight was 127 gms; spleen weight for ITP specimens was 90 gms; for non ITP diagnosis mean weight was 230 gms. Accessory spleens were identified and excised in two patients. Mean operative time for all patients was 137 minutes. Mean operative blood loss was 202 ml; no patients were transfused as a result of perioperative bleeding. Time to start diet was from 1-2 days and length of stay was 2.9 days. Two patients had post op fevers requiring prolonged length of stay. There were two readmission for deep venous thrombosis, and one for brain toxoplasmosis six weeks post op. Two ITP patients older than 40 years relapsed during the first year. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic splenectomy can be safely performed using the lateral approach with a high success rate, low rate of blood loss and a low rate of perioperative complications. Laparoscopic splenectomy should be offered to all patients undergoing surgery for ITP.

Accessory spleens can be adequately identified and excised using laparoscopic splenectomy. Hematologic response in ITP is adequate with laparoscopic splenectomy.",M2
19950603,"[Clinical significance of HA117 expression in children with acute leukemia]OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of the expression of HA117 gene in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) with acute leukemia and multidrug resistance. METHODS: HA117 gene expressions in 36 children with acute leukemia and 10 children with Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) were tested using semi quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. RESULTS: The HA117 gene was expressed in 75% of children with acute leukemia. There was no significant difference in HA117 gene expression between children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 69.57%) and children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 91.67%). But the semi-quantitative expression of HA117/beta-actin in AML childern was significantly higher than in ALL children (q=4.5852, P&lt;0.01). The expressions of HA117 gene and HA117/beta-actin in both ALL and AML children were significantly higher than in ITP children chi2=5.05, 8.81; q=4.4612, 6.9695; P&lt;0.05). The remission patients had lower expression of HA117/beta-actin and similar expression of HA117 compared with initially diagnosed patients. The remission patients had higher expression of HA117 gene and similar expression of HA117/beta-actin compared with patients with ITP. The non-remission patients had higher expression of HA117/beta-actin than remission patients and ITP patients (q=3.1705, 4.4102, P&lt;0.05), but no significant difference from initially diagnosed patients (q=0.5470, P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of HA117 gene is high in the BMMNC of initially diagnosed and non-remission patients with AL. But the remission patients have similar semi-quantitative expression of HA117 as patients with ITP, which indicates that a quantitative testing is more important. The expression of HA117 gene decreases with the improvement of the illness. HA117 is one of the factors that may affect the clinical remission of AML. The new gene HA117 may also be associated with multidrug resistance of leukemia.",M2
19945546,"The geoepidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura.First described in 1735 (Watson-Williams et al., 1958), immune-mediated platelet destruction is a phenomenon of protean associations that has historically varied in its definition. Recently, consensus guidelines were proposed for a standardized system of nomenclature that preserves the acronym  <e>ITP</e>  but encompasses a number of causes of immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, including both primary immune thrombocytopenia as well as such entities as thrombocytopenia associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer. In this paper, we will focus on current aspects of geoepidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of adult and pediatric primary immune thrombocytopenia. It is clear that both genetic and extrinsic factors exist for ITP and are likely different between children and adults. Immune thrombocytopenia remains a challenging problem but our understanding of its pathophysiology has greatly improved.",M2

Her ICP remained severely elevated despite aggressive medical measures, with persistent obtundation, right hemiparesis and a dilated left pupil. Bilateral decompressive craniectomies (DCs) were performed, which resulted in a rapid decline in ICP. Ultimately, the patient regained consciousness and went on to complete neurological recovery. Tragically, she died of non-neurological, ITP-related complications 9 months later. In our review, we identified no other instances of bilateral DCs reported in the management of an infant with ITP and/or an ICH. We addressed three central questions: (1) Is there any value of DCs in children, and especially in infants, with elevated ICP? (2) Is there any value of DCs in the setting of non-traumatic ICH? And (3) is there any rationale for the use of bilateral versus unilateral DCs?",M2

She had suffered no major hemorrhagic complications, although her platelet counts were between 3.0 x 10(9)/l and 50.0 x 10(9)/l. Magnetic resonance angiography identified a fusiform aneurysm of the right vertebral artery. Endovascular trapping after high-dose gammaglobulin with steroid therapy was performed. The patient received antiplatelet therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. The parent artery and aneurysm were completely occluded with no hemorrhagic complications. Endovascular treatment is considered safe in patients with ITP, although careful periprocedural management of platelet count is required.",M2
19932437,"Traditional and new approaches to the management of immune thrombocytopenia: issues of when and who to treat.Diagnosis and management of chronic <e>ITP</e> requires experience and the appropriate use of the laboratory despite the absence of a diagnostic test for ITP. Consideration of secondary ITP is important because identification of immunodeficiency infections or of lymphoproliferative disorders would change the management approach to a given patient. The development of newer therapies such as rituximab and the thrombopoietic agents has had a major impact on the management of ITP. In the future, combinations of agents may be a critical approach although the schedule and dosing remains difficult to establish. Finally, current studies to augment therapy in newly diagnosed ITP patients to prevent chronic disease may lessen the number of patients in chronic disease category.",M2

Both are pooled plasma products and both result in an increase in the platelet count in approximately 60% to 70% of patients with ITP. Despite immediate increases in the platelet count, the duration of response is limited, with platelet increments lasting between 2 and 4 weeks. Infusion reactions are common but adverse events rare.

19932434,"Infectious causes of chronic immune thrombocytopenia.Persistent thrombocytopenia may be the consequence of chronic infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>). Studies have shown that on diagnosis of infections, treatment of the primary disease often results in substantial improvement or complete recovery of the thrombocytopenia. In patients with thrombocytopenia due to HCV-related chronic liver disease, the use of eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, normalizes platelet levels, thereby permitting the initiation of antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV has aided in platelet recovery, with a corresponding decrease in circulating viral load. Thrombocytopenia in the absence of other disease symptoms requires screening for H. pylori, especially in countries such as Japan, where there is a high prevalence of the disease and the chances of a platelet response to eradication therapy are high.",M2

19932432,"Thyroid disease in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.The literature regarding an association between thyroid disease and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) suggests that autoimmune thyroid disease is a frequent finding in patients with ITP. A strong association between other systemic autoimmune diseases and autoimmune thyroid diseases is also well documented. Therefore, the combination of autoimmune thyroid disease and ITP could reflect a more significant defect in the immune self-tolerance of these patients compared with those who have primary ITP alone. Such defects may characterize an ITP patient population as more refractory to standard ITP therapy. Screening patients for antithyroid antibodies would identify a patient population at greater risk of developing overt thyroid disease. These patients may be further screened with a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to detect subclinical thyroid disease.",M2
19932431,"Immune thrombocytopenia in patients with connective tissue disorders and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.It has been theorized that immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) is a syndrome characterized by various defects in immune regulation, resulting in a common phenotype, decreased blood platelets, and symptoms of mucocutaneous bleeding. Most often, successful treatment of the underlying connective tissue disorder with corticosteroids or other disease-modifying agents can simultaneously improve concurrent thrombocytopenia. The best evidence to date would support the targeting of treatment to the connective tissue disorder, expecting a simultaneous improvement in the platelet count. Due to the frequent relapses associated with many of the connective tissue disorders and the frequent use of immunosuppressant agents, splenectomy should be undertaken only in highly refractory patients. Differentiating the varying immunopathic etiologies that contribute to development of connective tissue disorders may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in a subset of these patients. The use of target therapies to treat connective tissue disorders has the potential of reducing the risk of the development of ITP or, conversely, inducing the development of immune thrombocytopenia.",M2

19925495,"Complement activation on platelets correlates with a decrease in circulating immature platelets in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.The role of the complement system in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is not well defined. We examined plasma from 79 patients with ITP, 50 healthy volunteers, and 25 patients with non-immune mediated thrombocytopenia, to investigate their complement activation/fixation capacity (CAC) on immobilized heterologous platelets. Enhanced CAC was found in 46 plasma samples (59%) from patients with ITP, but no samples from patients with non-immune mediated thrombocytopenia. Plasma from healthy volunteers was used for comparison. In patients with ITP, an enhanced plasma CAC was associated with a decreased circulating absolute immature platelet fraction (A-IPF) (&lt;15 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.027) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.024). The positive predictive value of an enhanced CAC for a low A-IPF was 93%, with a specificity of 77%. The specificity and positive predictive values increased to 100% when plasma CAC was defined strictly by enhanced C1q and/or C4d deposition on test platelets. Although no statistically significant correlation emerged between CAC and response to different pharmacological therapies, an enhanced response to splenectomy was noted (P &lt; 0.063). Thus, complement fixation may contribute to the thrombocytopenia of ITP by enhancing clearance of opsonized platelets from the circulation, and/or directly damaging platelets and megakaryocytes.",M2
19908301,"Outcome of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children.BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data on long-term probability of remission in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). Aim was to study the course and factors influencing remission of chronic ITP. Chronic ITP was defined as thrombocytopenia persisting &gt;6 months following initial diagnosis. PROCEDURES: Case-records of children with chronic ITP, aged &lt;14 years, were reviewed in this retrospective study (1987-2006). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy children were followed. Median age at diagnosis was 6 years. Median duration of follow up was 30 months (range 6-166). Isolated thrombocytopenia (even if &lt;10 x 10(9)/L) in the absence of  significant  bleeds, by itself was not considered an indication for drug therapy. Sixty-seven (24.8%) children attained complete remission (CR) over a median period of 18 months (range 7-120). The probabilities of remission at 5 years for males and females were 24% and 39.6%, respectively (P = 0.01). The probability of achieving remission at 10 years in children &lt;8 and &gt; or =8 years was 51.2% and 34%, respectively (P = 0.02). The probability of remission at 5 years for children who received some treatment, versus no treatment was 31.4% and 27%, respectively (P = 0.8). Nine of 18 children, who underwent splenectomy, achieved CR. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred in 11 (4%) cases. The time of occurrence of ICH from onset of symptoms varied from 6 to 55 months. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted spontaneous remission rate with chronic ITP was 30% and 44% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Platelet count at diagnosis and the treatment administered did not influence remission outcomes. Age &lt;8 years and female gender were predictors of a favorable outcome.",M2
19900049,"Perinatal outcomes and complications of pregnancy in women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.OBJECTIVE: To investigate pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). METHODS: A retrospective study comparing all singleton pregnancies of women with and without ITP was conducted. Deliveries occurred between the years 1988 and 2007. Multiple logistic regression models were performed to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period, 186,602 deliveries were recorded, out of which 104 (0.06%) occurred in patients with ITP. In a multivariable analysis, we found the following conditions to be significantly and independently associated with ITP: hypertensive disorders, diabetes mellitus, and preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks gestation). Patients with ITP had significantly higher rates of preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks gestation; 6.7%vs. 2.2%; p &lt; 0.001) and perinatal mortality (4.8%vs. 1.3%; p = 0.011) when compared with patients without ITP. Two multivariable logistic regression models were constructed with perinatal mortality and preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks gestation) as the outcome variables to control for possible confounders such as congenital malformations, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and maternal age. In these models, ITP was found to be an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality (OR = 3.77; 95% CI 1.32-10.78, p = 0.013), as well as for preterm delivery before 34 weeks gestation (OR = 3.01; 95% CI 1.39-6.52, p = 0.005).

19897578,"Combination immunosuppressant therapy for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Treatment options for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) are limited. Because combination immunosuppressant therapy appeared to be effective in ITP and other disorders, we used this approach in patients with particularly severe and refractory ITP. In this retrospective, observational study, we determined the response (platelet count above 30 x 10(9)/L and doubling of baseline) among 19 refractory ITP patients. Treatment consisted of azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine. The patients had failed a median of 6 prior treatments, including splenectomy (in all except 1). Of 19 patients, 14 (73.7%) achieved a response lasting a median of 24 months, after which time 8 (57.1%) relapsed. Of the 8 relapsing patients, 6 responded to additional treatments. Of the 14 patients who achieved an initial response, 2 (14.3%) remained in remission after eventually stopping all medications. Severe adverse events did not occur. Combination immunosuppressant therapy can produce a rise in the platelet count that is sometimes sustained in refractory ITP patients.",M2
19888524,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT II) - a drug-associated autoimmune disease.Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterised by isolated persistent thrombocytopenia and normal megakaryopoiesis. This definition also applies to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT II), a frequent side effect of heparin treatment. In HIT II, the immunogen is a coagulation active complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4). By now, diagnostics of HIT II is often material and time consuming. Three groups of patients were investigated for HIT II antibodies (HIT II-AB): 54 hospitalised stroke patients, 87 hospitalised cardiac patients, and 71 patients on chronic haemodialysis, all treated with heparin. Furthermore, 100 healthy volunteers were investigated. For detection of HIT II-AB the innovative whole blood test PADA-HIT (PADA: platelet adhesion assay) was used. PADA-HIT quantifies the interaction of IgG antibodies with FcgammaIIA receptors by comparing the activation state of platelets in citrated and heparinised whole blood. The occurrence of HIT II-AB in blood was very high with 44 % of stroke patients, 69% of cardiac patients and 38% of haemodialysis patients compared to only 15% of healthy volunteers. This demonstrates a high incidence and a rapid onset of HIT II-AB in patients being acutely treated with heparin. HIT II is one of the most frequent and severe autoimmune diseases bearing a great thrombosis risk. PADA-HIT represents an innovative diagnostic method for detection of autoimmune antibodies of IgG type that are directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin-complex. By early and fast diagnostics and appropriate treatment severe complications of HIT II can be prevented.",M2
19200304,"Romiplostim: a breakthrough treatment for the management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Initially, immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) was considered to be a disease of increased platelet destruction. Consequently, treatments for ITP patients were focused on reducing the destruction of platelets. However, recent research on the pathogenesis of ITP points to a role of suboptimal platelet production, and this has led to the development of new treatment options which increase platelet production such as the novel thrombopoiesis-stimulating agent, romiplostim. In two, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase III trials, romiplostim was able to increase and sustain platelet counts in both splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients. Eighty-three per cent (69/83) of the romiplostim-treated patients achieved an overall platelet response compared with 7% (3/42) of patients receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.0001; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlled for splenectomy and baseline concurrent ITP therapy). Patients from the romiplostim studies, with platelet counts below 50 x 10(9)/L, were able to enter a long-term, open-label, extension study. The results of the long-term study showed that platelet counts above 50 x 10(9)/L were maintained for &gt; or =10, &gt; or =25 and &gt; or =52 consecutive weeks by 78% (102/131), 54% (66/122) and 35% (29/84) of patients, respectively. Romiplostim appears to be generally well tolerated and several patients have now been treated for more than 3 yrs. Most adverse events tend to be mild to moderate in nature. Romiplostim provides a valid treatment option that may bring about a change in the way that patients with ITP are treated in the future. Further studies are now being undertaken in paediatric patients with ITP, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.",M2

Treatment guidelines are available but, given the current small amount of data from research and randomized, controlled trials, the guidelines are largely based on expert opinion rather than on evidence. At the moment, it is only recommended that those patients with severe bleeding and/or extremely low platelet counts (&lt;10 x 10(9)/L) definitely require treatment.

19200302,"Characteristics of immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a guide for clinical practice.Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is an autoantibody-mediated condition characterized by an abnormally low number of platelets in the circulating blood. Originally, the cause of ITP was attributed to accelerated antibody-mediated platelet destruction where the rate of thrombopoiesis was inadequate to offset the increased rate of platelet destruction. However, new evidence has indicated that insufficient or inadequate platelet production is also responsible for low platelet counts, and research has focused on the development of treatments that increase platelet production. ITP affects both children and adults and can be either acute or chronic. To manage and treat ITP effectively, an exhaustive assessment of the signs and symptoms must be undertaken because the clinical manifestation of ITP can be highly variable among patients. At the moment, the diagnostic approach in ITP is based largely on a process of exclusion due to the lack of available data regarding clinical and laboratory parameters. The diagnostic procedures used in children and adults are similar and involve collecting the patient's history and performing a physical examination. Laboratory investigations are kept simple in patients with suspected ITP and include a full blood count and peripheral blood smear. A number of specialized laboratory assays have been developed with varying degrees of success. There remains scope for improving and simplifying the diagnostic process to identify ITP.",M2
19200301,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura: epidemiology and implications for patients.The age-adjusted prevalence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is estimated to be 9.5 per 100,000 persons in the USA while its annual incidence is estimated to be 2.68 per 100,000 in Northern Europe (at a cut-off platelet count of &lt;100 x 10(9)/L). The mean age of adults at diagnosis in Europe is 50 yrs and the incidence of ITP increases with age. Both the treatments used to treat patients with ITP and the disease itself can impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). As the incidence of ITP in Europe rises, especially in the elderly, the number of patients with a decreased HRQoL is increasing. Literature searches and focus groups have aided the development of a conceptual model to assess HRQoL. In this model, low platelet counts and the associated symptoms of ITP in addition to the side effects of treatment are proposed as the main determinants of a negatively impacted HRQoL. Primary conceptual domains of HRQoL, affected in patients with ITP, include emotional health, functional health, work, social and leisure activities and reproductive health. As treatment benefits are likely to improve these domains, the conceptual model could be used for better management of patients, taking into account HRQoL. The short-form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) and the ITP Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) are validated measures of HRQoL which can provide a comprehensive assessment of numerous factors to help evaluate decisions about patient management. Future clinical trials investigating treatment options for ITP should assess HRQoL using these validated questionnaires.",M2
19878056,"Mesenchymal stem cells are functionally abnormal in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.BACKGROUND AIMS: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is a bleeding disorder characterized by an accelerated destruction of platelets as a result of the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Patients with ITP also display activated platelet-autoreactive T cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) inhibit both T- and B-cell activation and may have functional impairments in autoimmune disorders. METHODS: We analyzed the potential role of MSC in the pathogenesis of ITP. RESULTS: MSC from ITP showed an impaired proliferative capacity and a lower capability of inhibiting activated T-cell proliferation compared with healthy donors. While MSC from controls showed a decreased expression of p27 after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor, this effect was not observed in MSC from patients. Furthermore, MSC from healthy donors down-regulated p16 upon exposure to platelet-released supernatant, while this effect was not observed for ITP. Interestingly, caspase 9 expression was higher in MSC from ITP. CONCLUSIONS: These abnormalities suggest a role of MSC malfunction in the physiopathology of the disease and may have therapeutic implications.",M2

In order to improve the care of patients with ITP, it is useful to understand how often such patients receive appropriate treatment and if common errors occur that could be avoided. We retrospectively analyzed all the clinical records between 1 January, 2000 and 31 December, 2002 of patients receiving an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 287.3 in three hospitals in northern Italy. We examined whether management strategies of adult men and nonpregnant women with ITP were consistent or not with the guidelines provided by the American Society of Hematology. The ITP diagnosis was confirmed in 120 of 169 patients (71%). Reasons for admission were: medical treatment for ITP (51.7%), medical or surgical treatment of ITP-associated disorders (30.8%), elective splenectomy (15.8%) and diagnosis or observation of ITP (1.7%). Hospital admission resulted appropriate in 78.1% of cases. Therapeutic interventions were appropriate in 100% of cases for glucocorticoid treatment, 86.4% for splenectomy, 47.7% for high-dose immunoglobulins, 40.9% for prophylaxis against bleeding before splenectomy, 33.3% for high-dose glucocorticoid treatment, and 19% for prophylaxis against bacterial infections before splenectomy. Platelet transfusions as treatment for bleeding were appropriate in only 20% of cases.

19852803,"Measuring disease-specific quality of life in rare populations: a practical approach to cross-cultural translation.BACKGROUND: Disease-specific quality of life (QoL) measures have enhanced the capacity of outcome measures to evaluate subtle changes and differences between groups. However, when the specific disease is rare, the cohort of patients is small and international collaboration is often necessary to accomplish meaningful research. As many of the QoL measures have been developed in North American English, they require translation to ensure their usefulness in a multi-cultural and/or international society. Published guidelines provide formal methods to achieve cross-culturally comparable versions of a QoL tool. However, these guidelines describe a rigorous process that is not always feasible, particularly in rare disease groups. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the process that was developed to achieve accurate cross-cultural translations of a disease-specific QoL measure, to overcome the challenges of a small sample size, i.e. children with a rare disorder. PROCEDURE: A measurement study was conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany and Uruguay, during which the validated measure was translated into the languages of the respective countries. RESULTS: This is a report of a modified, child-centric, cross-cultural translation and adaptation process in which culturally appropriate and methodologically valid translations of a disease-specific QoL measure, the Kids' <e>ITP</e> Tools (KIT), were performed in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The KIT was translated from North American English into UK English, French, German, and Spanish. CONCLUSION: This study was a successful international collaboration.

19849935,"[Levels of Toll-like receptors-2,-4 on platelets in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]OBJECTIVE: To study the changes and significance of Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) on platelets, CD86 on lymphocytes and concentrations of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 in serum in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 24 children with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP), 21 children with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (CITP) and 20 normal children (control group). Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on platelets and CD86 on lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured using ABC-ELISA. RESULTS: The expression of CD41+TLR2+ and CD61+TLR4+ in the AITP and the CITP groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (p&lt;0.01). The AITP group had lower expression of CD41+TLR2+ and CD61+TLR4+ than the CITP group (p&lt;0.01). The expression of CD86+ in the AITP and the CITP groups was significantly higher than that in the control group (p&lt;0.01). The serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma in the AITP and the CITP groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). There was a positive correlation between CD41+TLR2+ and CD61+TLR4+ expression. CD41+TLR2+ and CD61+TLR4+ expression were negatively correlated with CD86+ expression and serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: The detections of TLR2 and TLR4 on platelets, CD86 on lymphocytes and serum concentrations of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 are of great value in understanding the pathogenesis and predicting types of ITP in children.",M2
19846889,"International consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia.Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents, and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence.

19845743,"Treatment practices in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia - a European perspective.Immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) is characterised by platelet destruction and impaired production leading to isolated thrombocytopenia. The aim of this study, comprising a retrospective longitudinal cohort study complemented by a Delphi panel of 35 physicians, was to describe standard treatment practices and treating physician's perception and preferences for available treatment options in chronic ITP. The medical records of 610 patients were reviewed over 12 months. Mean age at the start of the observational period was 54.6 yr, median platelet count 77 x 10(9)/L with 41% of patients having symptoms of ITP. Treated patients (61%) received an average of 2.7 medications either for ITP or ITP treatment-related side effects. An array of products was used, but the most frequent were corticosteroids. Delphi panel physicians (45%) indicated the main goals for treatment were to increase platelet levels to at least 30 x 10(9)/L to prevent bleeding or haemorrhage. The majority (89%) indicated that personal experience influenced treatment choice. Most (&gt;80%) rated splenectomy and high-dose corticosteroids as the most effective but were concerned about side effects, and many (75%) would like access to interventions with improved efficacy and safety. The study highlights the need for updated evidence-based treatment guidelines to assist physicians in patient treatment decisions and to realise improvements in patient outcomes. It also identified perceived shortcomings of existing therapies and the need to establish an evidence base for newer interventions that could potentially make lasting response to treatment with fewer adverse effects an achievable goal.",M2
19843480,"Romiplostim in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is characterized by platelet deficiency due to platelet destruction and/or inadequate production. Initial therapy consists of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Patients with chronic refractory disease might undergo splenectomy. Although there is no treatment of choice in those who do not respond to splenectomy, immunosuppressive agents are typically prescribed. Romiplostim is the first available drug in a recently developed class of agents that work through stimulation of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (c-Mpl) to increase platelet production. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report was to review the mechanism of action, pharmacology, clinical activity, and adverse events associated with the use of romiplostim for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP. METHODS: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Web of Science were searched for English-only clinical trials and reviews (publication dates: 2000-June 1, 2009; key terms: romiplostim, Nplate, ITP, and idiopathic and immune thrombocytopenic purpura). Abstracts from the 2000-2008 meetings of the American Society of Hematology and references from relevant articles were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included. Romiplostim is the first marketed agent developed to directly stimulate the bone marrow to produce platelets. Produced in Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA technology, it is an Fc-peptide fusion protein. It works intracellularly in a manner similar to that of the naturally occurring TPO to activate the transcriptional pathways, leading to increased platelet production via stimulation of the c-Mpl receptor. Romiplostim was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic ITP primarily based on the findings from 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in 125 adult patients with chronic ITP and an insufficient response to corticosteroids, IVIg, and/or splenectomy. The most common prior treatments were corticosteroids (94%) and IVIg (80%). Sixty-three patients (50%) were splenectomized a median of 6.6 years earlier. Baseline platelet counts were &lt;30 x 10(9) cells/L. The initial dose of romiplostim was 1 microg/kg/wk SC, with adjustments to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 200 x 10(9) cells/L. The primary end point was a durable platelet response (&gt;or=50 x 10(9) cells/L for &gt;or=6 of the last 8 weeks of treatment). The proportion of patients in whom a durable platelet response was achieved was significantly greater with romiplostim than with placebo (49% vs 2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Overall platelet responses (durable plus transient) were achieved in 83% (69/83) with romiplostim and 7% (3/42) with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). An interim report of findings from an ongoing extension study found that response was maintained for up to 156 weeks (median, 69 weeks) with romiplostim. The most common adverse events were headache (37%), nasopharyngitis (32%), contusion (30%), epistaxis (30%), fatigue (30%), arthralgia (25%), and diarrhea (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from this review, romiplostim administration has been associated with a durable platelet response in these patients with refractory chronic ITP. Romiplostim has been found to be generally well tolerated.",M2
19843385,"A retrospective analysis of therapeutic responses to two distinct corticosteroids in 259 children with acute primary idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the responses of pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed acute primary idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) to two distinct corticosteroids. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 259 patients with acute ITP diagnosed between 2004 and 2008. Specifically, we compared response rates and adverse effects in patients treated with methylprednisolone or dexamethasone. RESULTS: Corticosteroids were used as the first-line treatment in all patients with an initial response rate of 96.5%. Choice of the intravenous corticosteroid for treatment did not affect the outcome of patients. The time platelet count maintained at a normal level showed no statistical difference between patients administered with methylprednisolone or dexamethasone. Only minor adverse effects were observed in both groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both corticosteroids yielded similarly high response rates and minor adverse effects in ITP patients. This should be taken into account when choosing the treatment regimen for children with acute ITP.",M2
19835465,"Analysis of the impact and burden of illness of adult chronic <e>ITP</e> in the US.OBJECTIVE: Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the predominant diagnosis in the ICD-9-CM category of primary thrombocytopenia in adults, is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction and reduced platelet production. The objective of this study was to describe ITP patient demographics, treatment, medical care resource utilization, and costs from a real-world situation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Managed-care administrative claims data from January 1 2000 to February 29 2004 were used in a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the burden of illness of chronic idiopathic primary thrombocytopenia among adults in the US, with particular emphasis on chronic ITP. RESULTS: The annual prevalence of chronic, non-secondary, idiopathic thrombocytopenia in adults (out of &gt;5.5 million patients) was 0.08% (i.e., 80 persons in 100 000). The mean age of the total cohort was 56.5 years (men, 60.2; women, 53.3); ratio of women to men was 1.1:1. The most frequently used thrombocytopenia-associated treatments were pharmacological therapy (e.g., immunoglobulins and corticosteroids) and whole blood transfusions; frequently used concomitant medications were antibiotics, antihypertensive agents, analgesics, and antidepressants. These data indicate that idiopathic thrombocytopenia-associated medical resource utilization and the corresponding expenditures for those services were substantive and constant over time. A large proportion of the overall patient care was directed to the treatment of bleeding and bruising symptoms. Although hospital and ER use was infrequent, these services accounted for the majority of ITP-attributable costs (46.1% were attributable to ITP-related hospital admissions; 45.0% were attributable to ER services for ITP). CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for patient-directed care plans, fuller consideration of available treatments, and the potential reduction in patient burden of illness. Study limitations included a broadly defined cohort and possible underreporting of certain medications. Introduction of highly effective and well-tolerated medications may reduce the cost and resource burden of ITP on the healthcare system.",M2
19832917,"The role of oral hygiene in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is an acquired disease of children and adults defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent associated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia. Oral manifestations are gingival bleeding, petechiae, mucocutaneous bleeding and haemorrhage into tissues. CASE DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS: An 11-year-old Turkish female was referred to the periodontology clinic by the paediatric haematologist for the treatment of spontaneous gingival bleeding, gingival oedematous enlargement and hyperaemia. She was diagnosed as chronic ITP 6 months ago and she was told not to brush her teeth. She was also complaining with dull pain and oral malodor. She was motivated for oral hygiene and after consulting with paediatric haematologist, under the proper circumstances, dental plaque and calculus were removed. Healing was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Oral hygiene motivation and dental plaque control is crucial in order to prevent gingival bleeding, inflammation and severe periodontal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders. Understanding of the oral findings is essential in the management of patients and close cooperation between patients' dentist and haematologist is needed. Dental consultation is essential for diagnosis and improvement of medical conditions. It is possible to obtain adequate oral hygiene with limited performance and haematologic disorders are not handicaps for dental/periodontal procedures under the proper circumstances.",M2
19824872,"Raised expression of APRIL in Chinese patients with immune thrombocytopenia and its clinical implications.BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) is an immune-mediated disorder in which destruction of platelets is accelerated by anti-platelet autoimmune antibodies. B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), essential factors for B cell survival are elevated in systemic autoimmune diseases and correlated with clinical findings. High expression of BAFF has been shown in patients with ITP, but the status of APRIL in ITP is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of APRIL and it receptors, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and trans-membrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), in patients with ITP, and evaluate the correlation between plasma APRIL levels and platelet accounts or other clinical parameters. METHODS: Plasma samples from 57 patients with ITP, and 30 normal healthy subjects were assayed for APRIL plasma concentration by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the mRNA expression of APRIL and its receptors (BCMA and TACI) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) in 25 normal controls and 34 untreated ITP patients with active disease. RESULTS: The APRIL levels in the plasma samples from patients with ITP were significantly higher than those from healthy controls (p = 0.000). PBMNCs may be a source of the excess APRIL. Treated patients with normal platelet count have relatively normal plasma APRIL (p = 0.599). Plasma APRIL levels in active patients were significantly correlated with platelet counts (r = -0.387 and p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: APRIL is over expressed in untreated active ITP patients and might be a pathogenic factor of this disorder.",M2
19821437,"Medical treatments for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy.BACKGROUND: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is a common hematologic disorder caused by immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. The magnitude of the maternal-fetal risk of ITP during pregnancy is controversial. Labour management of pregnant women with ITP remains controversial. Management of ITP during pregnancy is complex because of the disparity between maternal and fetal platelet counts. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, vinca alkaloids, danazol, dapsone, and any other types of pharmacological treatments for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2009), LILACS (1982 to 8 February 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (8 February 2009), Current Controlled Trials (16 February 2009), Google Scholar (16 February 2009) and ongoing and unpublished trials cited in the reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on any medical treatments for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura during pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. MAIN RESULTS: This review included one RCT in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed.This RCT comparing the effect of betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) with no medication found no statistically significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 2.05) and neonatal bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.13). Review authors conducted an intention-to-treat analysis which showed similar findings: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.45 and RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.61, respectively. Maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage were not studied by this RCT. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates that compared to no medication, betamethasone did not reduce the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia and neonatal bleeding in ITP during pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of betamethasone for treating ITP. This Cohrane review does not provide evidence about other medical treatments for ITP during pregnancy. This systematic review also identifies the need for well-designed, adequately powered randomised clinical trials for this medical condition during pregnancy. Unless randomised clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade off between potential benefits and harms are established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should not use betamethasone for ITP in pregnant women. Any future trials on medical treatments for treating ITP during pregnancy should test a variety of important maternal, neonatal or both outcome measures, including maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage.",M2
19816666,"Refractory chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) has been associated with several hematologic malignancies such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but it is rare in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we report a 7-year-old girl with chronic ITP during early intensive phase of chemotherapy for ALL. She underwent splenectomy because thrombocytopenia had persisted even after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroids, vincristine, rituximab, and anti-D antibody. After splenectomy, her platelet count had recovered, and maintenance therapy could be resumed with a support of IVIG. To our knowledge, this is the first child case of chronic ITP during chemotherapy for ALL and splenectomy was effective in this patient.",M2
19813676,"Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients presenting with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). METHODS: From March 2007 to March 2008, thirty adult patients with ITP and 30 age and sex matched healthy controls were investigated for the presence of H. pylori infection by Helicobacter pylori stool antigen (HpSA) an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based method. The criteria for presence of H. pylori infection was a positive stool antigen test. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was found in 19 out of 30 patients with ITP (63.3%) which is well above the frequency of 13 out of 30 (43.3%) in controls. Calculated odds ratio was 2.25 which shows significant association of H. pylori infection with ITP. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the existence of an association between H. pylori infection and ITP. Therefore the screening for H. pylori infection and an attempt to eradicate bacterium in positive cases seems appropriate in patients with ITP at diagnosis.",M2
19801732,"[Childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (the results of 20-year experience)]Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) of Childhood is a common hemorrhagic diathesis. The purpose of the present work is to summarize the results of 20-year observation over children suffering ITP, to record certain progress in diagnosing and treatment of this disease and to raise the problems still to be solved. The authors have been observing 181 ITP patients (girls 89, boys 92) at the age of 3 months up to 15 years. Childhood ITP mostly occurs at the age of 1 to 6 year i.e. in the so called  critical period  of immune system forming. Several peculiar cases were identified among infants and the children above 10 years old. Clinical manifestation of all the ITP patients was characterized with cutaneous hemorrhagic syndrome. 95% of childhood cases showed deep thrombocytopenia with the thrombocyte level &lt;30X10 9/l. Most of the patients suffered acute form of ITP (87,9%). In the majority of cases illness took its normal predictable course after the glucocorticosteroid therapy. In heavy cases the combination of glucocorticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended. The indications of splenectomy were considered to be heavy, life -threatening, excessive bleeding, mainly in cases of chronic, steadily recurrent forms of ITP. Remissions were achieved in most of cases.",M2
19797730,"High-dose dexamethasone regulates interleukin-18 and interleukin-18 binding protein in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.To evaluate the effects of high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) on the balance of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and its endogenous antagonist IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in <e>ITP</e> patients, IL-18, IL-18BP as well as IFN-gamma, IL-4 plasma levels and platelet counts were determined in 17 ITP patients receiving DXM 40 mg/day for four consecutive days and in 24 healthy subjects. Using RT-PCR, the mRNA expression of IL-18, IL-18BP, IFN-gamma, IL-4, T-box (T-bet) and GATA-binding protein 3(GATA-3) were studied in all subjects. The in vitro effects of DXM on IL-18BP and IL-18 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were studied by ELISA. HD-DXM administration increased IL-18BP and reduced IL-18 expression significantly (p&lt;0.05), which resulted in a downregulation of IL-18/IL-18BP ratio p&lt;0.05). In vitro, DXM had a significant effect on secretion of IL-18BP while diminishing IL-18 release from cultures of PBMCs. These results suggest that downregulation of IL-18/IL-18BP might account for its clinical efficacy of HD-DXM in active ITP.",M2
19794139,"The effects of BAFF and BAFF-R-Fc fusion protein in immune thrombocytopenia.Elevated level of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases. Blockade of receptor and ligand binding by decoy receptor has demonstrated a clinical benefit in both oncologic and immunologic diseases. In this report, we have detected plasma BAFF and BAFF mRNA expression in immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effects of recombinant human BAFF (rhBAFF) and BAFF-R-Fc fusion protein (BR3-Fc) on B cells, T cells, platelets, secretion of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. Patients with active disease had higher levels of plasma BAFF and BAFF mRNA than patients in remission and controls. In in vitro assays, rhBAFF promoted the survival of CD19(+) and CD8(+) cells, and increased the apoptosis of platelets and the secretion of IFN-gamma. BR3-Fc successfully corrected the effects of rhBAFF on lymphocytes, platelets, and cytokines. These findings suggest that BAFF may play a pathogenic role in ITP by promoting the survival of CD19(+) and CD8(+) cells, and increasing the apoptosis of platelets and the secretion of IFN-gamma. Blockade of BAFF by BR3-Fc might be a promising therapeutic approach for ITP.",M2
19776752,"Neonatal outcomes of pregnancy complicated by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with the prognosis of newborns born to mothers with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>), and to compare the infants with/without thrombocytopenia in terms of maternal and neonatal characteristics. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the charts of 29 parturients with ITP and their newborns who were born between January 1998 and December 2008. RESULT: A total of 16 (55%) gravidas had been diagnosed with ITP before pregnancy and 13 (45%) were diagnosed during pregnancy. Thrombocytopenia was observed in 21 gravidas. In total, 17 (58%) gravidas received treatment to increase the platelet count. The majority of deliveries (72.5%) were vaginal. The infant platelet counts at birth ranged from 20 to 336 x 10(9) per liter. None of the neonates had complications attributable to the mode of delivery. Normal platelet counts were determined in 15 newborns, whereas 14 infants had thrombocytopenia at birth. Three (10.3%) neonates had mild, four neonates (13.7%) had moderate and seven neonates (24.1%) had severe thrombocytopenia. The age of the mothers having infants with thrombocytopenia was significantly higher (30+/-5.3 vs 25.3+/-3.8 years), most of the infants (10/14 (71%)) were males (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy complicated with ITP generally has a good outcome. Although ITP in pregnancy carries a low risk, careful observation is required for the newborn of gravidas with ITP even when the infant has no bleeding complications at delivery, and infants may require treatment for thrombocytopenia.",M2
19767509,"Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in children with immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>): study of 40 cases.Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a rare but devastating complication of childhood immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). A survey of ICH from 1987 to 2000 identified cases of ICH in childhood ITP in the United States. Forty patients with ICH and 80 matched ITP control subjects were accrued. The estimated incidence of ICH was 0.19% to 0.78%. Platelet counts were less than 20 x 10(9)/L in 90% and less than 10 x 10(9)/L in 75% of children with ICH. Eighteen (45%) children developed ICH within 7 days of diagnosis of ITP; for 10 of these, ICH was the presenting feature of ITP. Twelve (30%) children had chronic ITP. Head trauma and hematuria were the most prominent features associated with ICH, identified in 33% and 22.5% of the patients with ICH and 1 and none of the controls (both P &lt; .001). Bleeding beyond petechiae and ecchymoses was also linked to ICH. Mortality was 25%; a further 25% had neurologic sequelae. Strategies by which high-risk children could be identified were considered, and the costs of preventive combination treatment were estimated. Children with severe thrombocytopenia plus head trauma and/or hematuria appeared to be at particularly high risk of ICH. Aggressive treatment of these children may be appropriate.",M2

Their immunosuppression included induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and maintenance treatment with cyclosporine and prednisone. Kidney transplantations were safely performed without any complication. The platelet count of our patients increased gradually after the surgery, and maintenance with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone allowed graft function and satisfactory hemostasis. During the 3- and 8-year follow-up periods in our recipients, graft function was well maintained.

METHODS: Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of GR alpha and GR beta mRNA in PBMC from 30 children with ITP (glucocorticoid-sensitive, n=18; glucocorticoid-resistant, n=12) and 10 healthy children (control group). Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure plasma levels of total glucocorticoids. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in PBMC GR alpha mRNA levels among the glucocorticoid sensitive, the glucocorticoid-resistant and the control groups. Compared with the glucocorticoid-sensitive and the control groups, the expression of GR beta mRNA in the glucocorticoid-resistant group was significantly up-regulated (p&lt;0.01). Plasma total glucocorticoids level in the glucocorticoid-resistant group was found to be much higher than that in the glucocorticoid-sensitive and the control groups (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulated expression of GR beta mRNA may associated with glucocorticoid resistance in children with ITP.",M2
19747289,"Clinical efficacy and safety of Flebogammadif, a new high-purity human intravenous immunoglobulin, in adult patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count and bleeding, whose incidence is approximately 6.2 for each 100,000 adults per year. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) can be useful in patients with ITP to prevent bleeding or prior to surgery. In this study, the efficacy and safety of Flebogammadif, a new high-purity IVIG, were assessed by an open, multicentre, non-controlled, prospective study in adult patients with chronic ITP. A total of 20 patients (enrolled if experiencing chronic ITP since at least 6 months before recruitment and if platelet count &lt;20 x 10(9)L(-1) before treatment) received 0.4 g kg(-1)-bw of Flebogammadif for 5 consecutive days and were followed-up for 3 months. Efficacy endpoints were three: proportion of patients who reached a platelet count &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)L(-1), time for the platelet count to reach that level and duration of response. Safety parameters [adverse events (AE), laboratory determinations and vital signs] and viral markers were regularly monitored. A total of 14 patients achieved a platelet count of &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)L(-1). The median time to platelet response was &lt;/=2.5 days, and the median number of days in which the platelet count remained &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)L(-1) was &gt; or = 7 days. A regression of haemorrhages was reported for 17 patients on day 14. Eight patients presented 21 AEs (mostly mild) potentially related to the study drug. Neither abnormalities in laboratory values nor in viral markers were registered during the follow-up period. Flebogammadif was well tolerated and succeeded in providing a haemostatic platelet count in patients with ITP.",M2

19740094,"Platelet size distinguishes between inherited macrothrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia.BACKGROUND: Distinguishing inherited thrombocytopenias from immune thrombocytopenia (<e>ITP</e>) can be difficult, and patients are therefore at risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments. Although it is known that the most common inherited forms of thrombocytopenia are characterized by increased platelet size, the diagnostic power of this feature has never been investigated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that platelet size can be used to differentiate ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias. Patients/methods: We measured mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet diameter (MPD), within 2 h of blood sampling, in 35 patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenias [15 MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD), three biallelic and 17 monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS)], and 56 with ITP. Using receiving operating characteristic analysis, we searched for the best cut-off values to differentiate between these conditions. RESULTS: As expected, platelets were larger in inherited macrothrombocytopenias than in ITP. An MPD larger than 3.3 mum differentiated MYH9-RD and BSS from ITP with 0.89 sensitivity and 0.88 specificity, and an MPV larger than 12.4 fL had 0.83 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity. Combining MPD with MPV increased sensitivity and specificity to 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSION: Platelet size evaluation by both an appropriate cell counter and blood film examination is useful for differentiating inherited macrothrombocytopenias from ITP.",M2
19731307,"Repeated courses of rituximab in chronic <e>ITP</e>: Three different regimens.This study investigated responses to retreatment with rituximab in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. Treatment with rituximab in chronic ITP patients induces long-lasting responses in approximately 30% of patients but even these patients may relapse. Twenty patients who had achieved a response to rituximab and relapsed were retreated with rituximab (375 mg/m(2)x 4); this data was analyzed retrospectively. Subsequently, 16 patients were prospectively randomized to receive rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CVP) or double dose rituximab (DDR). Retreatment with standard dose rituximab demonstrated responses similar to initial rituximab treatment in 15 of 20 patients. Neither of the two more intensive regimens (R-CVP, DDR) induced responses in any patient who had previously failed to respond to rituximab nor induced substantially longer-lasting responses among previous responders. No additional toxicity was noted with the DDR regimen, whereas R-CVP was not well tolerated. These results suggest that retreatment with standard dose rituximab induces similar responses in 75% of previously responding patients and is well tolerated. Neither combining rituximab with CVP nor doubling the dose of rituximab increased the response rate.",M2
19726374,"[Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on childhood acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Helicobacter pylor (Hp) eradication in children with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). METHODS: Ninety-three children with acute ITP and Hp infection were divided into two groups and treated with prednisone and Hp eradication (group A, 51 cases) or with prednisone without Hp eradication (group B, 42 cases). RESULTS: The Hp eradication rate was 94.1% in group A. No difference was found in the therapeutic effects on IPT between the two groups, but the recurrence rate in one year in group A was significantly lower than that in group B. CONCLUSION: NHp eradication does not obviously enhance the therapeutic effect on childhood acute ITP, but can decrease the relapse rate in one year. HP eradication therapy is recommended in children with acute ITP and Hp infection.",M2
19722275,"Subcutaneous anti-D treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children.We investigated the effect of subcutaneous anti-D IgG as platelet enhancing therapy in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). Twenty-three children were treated with subcutaneous anti-D 50 microg/kg. The median platelet count increased from 7 x 10(9) to 31 x 10(9)/L on day 3 (P &lt; 0.01). The median decline in hemoglobin was 1.3 g/dl. Two children experienced minor fever and chills within 24 hr of treatment. Pain at the injection site was common but self-limiting with no effect on activity level. These results suggest subcutaneous anti-D IgG 50 microg/kg as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in childhood ITP.",M2
19711585,"Romiplostim for the treatment of chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura.PURPOSE: On August 22, 2008, Romiplostim (Nplate for Injection) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. This report summarizes the FDA analyses of the clinical data supporting this approval. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, an uncontrolled extension study, and supportive studies. In the controlled studies, enrolled patients had completed at least one prior treatment for chronic ITP and had a platelet count &lt; or = 30 x 10(9)/L. One study enrolled patients who had undergone splenectomy; the other enrolled patients who had not undergone splenectomy. The primary endpoint in both controlled studies was durable platelet response. RESULTS: Overall, 125 patients were randomized in the controlled studies. A durable platelet response was observed in 61% of nonsplenectomized patients and 38% of patients who had undergone splenectomy. One placebo group patient achieved a durable platelet response. Serious hemorrhage events were reported in 10% of placebo recipients and 6% of romiplostim recipients. In the extension study, patients received romiplostim for a median of 60 weeks and a maximum of 96 weeks; the majority of patients maintained platelet counts &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)/L throughout the study. Major safety findings pertained to a risk for bone marrow reticulin formation and worsened thrombocytopenia following romiplostim discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA approved romiplostim for use among certain patients with chronic ITP. This approval included a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.",M2
19705429,"Cost and mortality associated with hospitalizations in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is associated with low platelet counts and, consequently, a high risk of adverse events leading to hospitalization. However, there are few data on the clinical and economic burden of hospitalizations for ITP. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database of discharges, a stratified 20% sample of all United States (US) community hospitals across all payers, was used to evaluate discharges in ITP patients. We developed nationally representative numbers of discharges in ITP patients from 2003 to 2006 based on diagnosis codes. Using appropriate weights for each NIS discharge, we created national estimates of average cost, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality for specific groups of ITP-related hospitalizations. Approximately 129,000 discharges occurred between 2003 and 2006 in ITP patients. The average cost associated with all discharges in 2008 dollars was 16,476, with a 6.4-day length of stay and in-hospital mortality of 3.8%. In contrast, the average cost of all hospitalizations in the US population during the same period was 10,039, the average length of stay was 4.8 days, and in-hospital mortality was 2.5%. Mortality risk was higher for ITP patients than for the standard US population adjusted for age and gender, with a relative mortality ratio of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). On the basis of a nationally representative sample of US discharge records from 2003 to 2006, hospitalization with ITP represents an economically and clinically important event. ITP was associated with higher costs, longer stays, and more in-hospital deaths on average than all other hospitalized patients combined.",M2
19696477,"DNMT3B 579G&gt;T promoter polymorphism and the risk for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a Chinese population.Epigenetics may influence the expression of numerous genes, which might contribute to autoimmune diseases. DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases, especially DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B). Polymorphisms of the DNMT3B gene may influence DNMT3B activity on DNA methylation and increase the susceptibility to several diseases. The current study investigated the association between DNMT3B 579G&gt;T and the risk for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). The DNMT3B 579G&gt;T polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. There was no significant difference in genotype and allele distribution between the ITP patient and the controls (p = 0.722 and 0.667, respectively). Similar results were observed between the 2 groups when stratified by age and disease course, including acute in childhood, chronic in childhood, acute in adult and chronic in adult. Importantly, this study showed a statistical difference in the distribution of SNP of DNMT3B between Chinese and Koreans or Americans. It is shown that the SNP of DNMT3B 579G&gt;T may not be used on its own as a marker to predict the susceptibility to ITP in a Chinese population and that DNMT3B 579G&gt;T promoter SNP varies from one ethnic population to another.",M2
19687596,"Acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura complicated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in an elderly patient.Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) is a hemorrhagic disease that often occurs in the elderly. It generally presents as a chronic disease with insidious onset, and is frequently resistant to various therapies. Compared to patients less than 40 years old, those older than 60 years tend to show a higher rate of ITP-related mortality. The present report describes a 73-year-old patient with acute ITP who experienced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that responded well to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy combined with corticosteroid pulse therapy.",M2
19714591,"Short-term and long-term failure of laparoscopic splenectomy in adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients: a systematic review.Splenectomy is a common therapy for adults with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>). Thisstudy was designed to estimate both the short-term surgical non-response rate and the long-term relapse rate after laparoscopic splenectomy. A systematic review was conducted of articles published between January 1, 1991 and January 1, 2008. Selection criteria included: chronic ITP, study enrollment in 1990 or later, &gt; or =12 months of follow-up, &gt; or =15 patients with ITP, &gt; or =75% of patients at least 14 years of age, not HIV positive, not undergoing a second splenectomy, and type of performed splenectomy clearly reported. Data were pooled across studies to estimate rates. We identified 170 articles, of which 23 met our inclusion criteria (all observational studies). These studies represent 1,223 laparoscopic splenectomies (71 or 5.6% were converted to open splenectomy during surgery). The pooled short-term surgical non-response rate among the 18 studies reporting data was 8.2% (95% CI 5.4-11.0). The pooled long-term relapse rate across all 23 studies was 43.6 per 1,000 patient years (95% CI 28.2-67.2). This translates to an approximate failure rate of 28% at 5 years for all patients undergoing splenectomy. Studies with shorter durations of follow-up had significantly higher pooled relapse rates than studies with longer follow-up (P = 0.04). Laparoscopicsplenectomy is effective for most patients. Splenectomy may have higher initial relapse rates, particularly, in the first 2 years after surgery, and the rate may decline over time. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",M2
19712170,"Helicobacters and extragastric diseases.For two decades, Helicobacter pylori has been considered as the culprit in many extragastric manifestations. However, for several of these supposed associations the hypothesis of an etiological role has not yet been fully investigated. This may be due to a series of factors linked to the epidemiological features of the studies and to the diseases investigated. This review attempts to highlight the main reported associations of H. pylori with extragastric manifestations during the last year. The most convincing data arise in the field of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (<e>ITP</e>) and sideropenic anemia. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that 50% of subjects with ITP maintain a hematological response after H. pylori eradication. There is also growing evidence of the role of H. pylori in other diseases, including ischemic heart disease even though results are not conclusive.",M2
