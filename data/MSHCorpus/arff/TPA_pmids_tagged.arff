20423347,"Shikonin reduces oedema induced by phorbol ester by interfering with IkappaBalpha degradation thus inhibiting translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the present paper we studied the effect of shikonin on ear oedema induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), and determined the mechanisms through which shikonin might exert its topical anti-inflammatory action. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Acute ear oedema was induced in mice by topical application of TPA. The in vitro assays used macrophages RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase Calpha, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), phosphorylated ERK (pERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), pJNK, p38, p-p38, p65, p-p65, inhibitor protein of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (IkappaBalpha) and pIkappaBalpha were measured by Western blotting, activation and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA was detected by reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively, and NF-kappaB p65 localization was detected by immunocytochemistry. KEY RESULTS: Shikonin reduced the oedema (inhibitory dose 50 = 1.0 mg per ear), the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (70%) and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (100%) in vivo. It significantly decreased TPA-induced translocation of protein kinase Calpha, the phosphorylation and activation of ERK, the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and the TPA-induced NF-kappaB-DNA-binding activity in mouse skin. Moreover, in RAW 264.7 cells, shikonin significantly inhibited the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA in a dose-dependent manner and the nuclear translocation of p65. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Shikonin exerted its topical anti-inflammatory action by interfering with the degradation of IkappaBalpha, thus inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB.",M1
20406988,"The tumor-suppressive function of Connexin43 in keratinocytes is mediated in part via interaction with caveolin-1.Connexin43 (Cx43) is known to have tumor-suppressive effects, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In keratinocytes, we previously showed that the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43 directly interacts with the tumor suppressor Cav-1. We now show that rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK) that are reduced in Cx43 present features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and are more invasive than their control counterparts, whereas overexpression of Cx43 inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced invasive properties. Carbenoxolone did not alter the inhibitory effect of Cx43 against TPA- and EGF-induced cell invasion, indicating the involvement of a gap junctional intercellular communication-independent mechanism. Interestingly, the association of Cx43 with Cav-1 was found to be reduced after TPA and EGF treatment. Accordingly, the colocalization of Cx43 with Cav-1 was diminished in cells from a human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as in sections from human keratinocyte tumors, suggesting that Cx43/Cav-1 interaction plays a protective role against keratinocyte transformation. As opposed to cells that overexpress Cx43-GFP, invasion could be induced in rat epidermal keratinocytes that overexpressed a GFP-tagged truncated mutant of Cx43 (Delta244-GFP) that we previously showed not to interact with Cav-1, as well as in cells that overexpressed Cx43-GFP but were reduced in Cav-1. Our data show that Cx43 possesses tumor-suppressive properties in keratinocytes and provide the first evidence that the Cx43/Cav-1 interaction is altered in keratinocyte transformation processes, as well as in human keratinocyte tumors, and that this association might play a role in Cx43-mediated tumor suppression.",M1
20390770,"Cancer preventive agents 10. Prenylated dehydrozingerone analogs as potent chemopreventive agents.Dehydrozingerone analogs and related compounds were screened as potential antitumor promoters by using the in vitro short-term 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation assay. Among the 40 synthesized compounds, the prenylated analogs 16 and 34-36 showed the most significant and promising activity (100% inhibition of activation at 1 x 10(3) mol ratio/TPA, and 82-80%, 37-35%, and 13-11% inhibition at 5 x 10(2), 1 x 10(2), and 1 x 10 mol ratio/TPA, respectively) in this screening. Their activity profiles were comparable to those of the reference standard curcumin. While a prenyl moiety conferred potent chemopreventive activity, an extended prenyl unit such as a farnesyl moiety did not improve activity. Because in vitro inhibitory effects in this assay generally correlate well with in vivo inhibitory effects on tumor promotion, our results strongly suggested that prenylated 16 and 34-36 are likely to be promising antitumor promoters.",M1
20388733,"Phosphorylation of paxillin at threonine 538 by PKCdelta regulates LFA1-mediated adhesion of lymphoid cells.We investigated the PKCdelta-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin within its LIM4 domain and the involvement of this phosphorylation in activation of LFA-1 integrins of the Baf3 pro-B lymphocytic cell line. Using phosphorylated-threonine-specific antibodies, phosphorylated amino acid analysis and paxillin phosphorylation mutants, we demonstrated that <e>TPA</e>, the pharmacological analog of the endogenous second messenger diacyl glycerol, stimulates paxillin phosphorylation at threonine 538 (T538). The TPA-responsive PKC isoform PKCdelta directly binds paxillin in a yeast two-hybrid assay and phosphorylates paxillin at T538 in vitro and also co-immunoprecipitates with paxillin and mediates phosphorylation of this residue in vivo. Recombinant wild-type paxillin, its phospho-inhibitory T538A or phospho-mimetic T538E mutants were expressed in the cells simultaneously with siRNA silencing of the endogenous paxillin. These experiments suggest that phosphorylation of paxillin T538 contributes to dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, redistribution of LFA-1 integrins and an increase in their affinity. We also show that phosphorylation of T538 is involved in the activation of LFA-1 integrins by TPA.",M1
20384317,"Glutarimide alkaloids and a terpenoid benzoquinone from Cordia globifera.Three new compounds, a meroterpene (2) having a cyclopropane moiety named globiferane and glutarimide alkaloids named cordiarimides A (3) and B (4), were isolated from the roots of Cordia globifera. Compounds 2-4 exhibited weak cytotoxic activity. Cordiarimide B (4) exhibited radical scavenging activity, as it inhibited superoxide anion radical formation in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XXO) assay, and also suppressed superoxide anion generation in differentiated HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells when induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). This is the first report on the presence of glutarimide alkaloids in the genus Cordia.",M1
20383193,"Rac1 is crucial for Ras-dependent skin tumor formation by controlling Pak1-Mek-Erk hyperactivation and hyperproliferation in vivo.Rac1 has a role in proliferation and survival of tumor cells in vitro. The exact effects of Rac1 on growth, apoptosis and corresponding signaling pathways during tumorigenesis in vivo, however, have not been explored yet. Using mice with a keratinocyte-restricted deletion of the Rac1 gene, we found that Rac1 is essential for DMBA/<e>TPA</e>-induced skin tumor formation. This corresponded to a decreased keratinocyte hyperproliferation, although apoptosis was not detectably altered. Activated Rac1 promoted Erk-dependent hyperproliferation by Pak1-mediated Mek activation independent of Mek1 phosporylation at serine 298. Rac1 was furthermore required for Pak2-dependent hyperactivation of Akt, which under in vivo condition was restricted to the suprabasal cell layers corresponding to a suprabasal-specific expression of Pak2. It is surprising that none of these signaling pathways was altered in untreated Rac1-deficient skin, indicating a hyperproliferation-specific function of Rac1 in vivo. These data suggest that blocking of Rac1 function might allow tumor-specific growth repression, as Rac1 is not required for normal growth and growth signaling controlling pathways in skin in vivo.",M1
20362231,"Cytogenetic investigations of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.This study aimed to determine which culture method would yield the highest culture success rate, mitotic index, banding resolution, and abnormality rate in investigation of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A range of culture techniques for conventional cytogenetic (CC) analyses was compared: 24-hour unstimulated, 72 hours incubation with additional fetal calf serum, 72 hours stimulation with interleukin 4, 72 hours stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 72 hours stimulation with <e>TPA</e> (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate), and 72 hours stimulation with CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 + Interleukin-2 (IL-2). CC abnormality rates were also compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results using probes for CLL (LSI D13S319/13q34/CEP 12: LSI ATM/p53). Forty-five samples from 24 patients (consisting of 11 newly diagnosed and 13 previously diagnosed patients) were included. For CC, a 100.0% culture success rate was achieved (n = 45) by means of an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) peripheral blood sample with an associated 62.5% CC abnormality rate (n = 24). FISH detected an abnormality rate of 75.0% (n = 24). The combined CC and FISH abnormality rate was 87.5% (n = 24). This study demonstrates that CC that uses TPA and DSP30 + IL-2 on EDTA peripheral blood is effective in the investigation of CLL and may be used as a supplement to FISH studies.",M1
20338640,"Transactivators Zta and Rta of Epstein-Barr virus promote G0/G1 to S transition in Raji cells: a novel relationship between lytic virus and cell cycle.In the present study, we show that the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latently infected Raji cells with <e>TPA</e>/SB caused the cell growth arrest. The Zta-positive cells were predominantly enriched in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. When Zta expression reached a maximal level, a fraction of Zta expressing cell population reentered S phase. Analysis of the expression pattern of a key set of cell cycle regulators revealed that the expression of Zta and Rta substantially interfered with the cell cycle regulatory machinery in Raji cells, strongly inhibiting the expression of Rb and p53 and inducing the expression of E2F1. Down-regulation of Rb was further demonstrated to be mediated by proteasomal degradation, and p53 and p21 affected at transcription level. The data indicate that both Zta and Rta promote entry into S phase of Raji cells. The important roles of Zta and Rta in EBV lytic reactivation were also demonstrated. Our finding suggests that these two transcriptional activators may act synergistically to govern the expression of downstream early and late genes as well as cellular genes and initiation of lytic cycle and manipulation of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms require the joint and interactive contributions of Rta and Zta.",M1
20332633,"Induction of LRF-1/ATF3 by vasopressin in hepatocytes: role of MAP kinases.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Liver regeneration factor 1 (LRF-1/ATF3) is an early response gene which is rapidly induced upon partial hepatectomy in rats, and by growth factors and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists in cultured rat hepatocytes. The aim of the present study was to examine the mechanisms involved in induction of LRF-1/ATF3 by the GPCR agonist vasopressin. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were treated with vasopressin, <e>TPA</e>, and the Ca2+-elevating agents thapsigargin and A23187. LRF-1/ATF3 mRNA and protein were measured by Northern blot analysis or RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Signalling pathways were examined by immunoblots and kinase assays. RESULTS: While elevation of intracellular calcium induced LRF-1/ATF3 expression, treatment with TPA did not. Inhibition of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, or pretreatment with calcium chelators did not affect vasopressin-induced expression of LRF-1/ATF3. Inhibition of each of the MAP kinases ERK1/2, JNK or p38 did not affect vasopressin-induced LRF-1/ATF3 expression. Combined inhibition of JNK and p38, and of ERK1/2 and either JNK or p38 suppressed vasopressin-induced expression of LRF-1/ATF3. CONCLUSION: Vasopressin induces LRF-1/ATF3 expression by mechanisms that differ from those activated by Ca2+-elevating agents. The results suggest that partly redundant, complex MAP kinase networks are involved in induction of LRF-1/ATF3 by vasopressin in hepatocytes.",M1
20308057,"RasGRP1 is essential for ras activation by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in epidermal keratinocytes.RasGRP1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras that binds with high affinity to diacylglycerol analogs like the phorbol esters. Recently, we demonstrated a role for RasGRP1 in skin carcinogenesis and suggested its participation in the action of tumor-promoting phorbol esters like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) on Ras pathways in epidermal cells. Given the importance of Ras in carcinogenesis, we sought to discern whether RasGRP1 was a critical pathway in Ras activation, using a RasGRP1 knockout (KO) mouse model to examine the response of keratinocytes to TPA. In contrast to the effect seen in wild type keratinocytes, Ras(GTP) levels were barely detected in RasGRP1 KO cells even after 60 min of exposure to phorbol esters. The lack of response was rescued by enforced expression of RasGRP1. Furthermore, small hairpin RNA-induced silencing of RasGRP1 abrogated the effect of TPA on Ras. Analysis of Ras isoforms showed that both H-Ras and N-Ras depended on RasGRP1 for activation by TPA, whereas activation of K-Ras could not be detected. Although RasGRP1 was dispensable for ERK activation in response to TPA, JNK activation was reduced in the KO keratinocytes. Notably, TPA-induced phosphorylation of JNK2, but not JNK1, was reduced by RasGRP1 depletion. These data identify RasGRP1 as a critical molecule in the activation of Ras by TPA in primary mouse keratinocytes and suggest JNK2 as one of the relevant downstream targets. Given the role of TPA as a skin tumor promoter, our findings provide additional support for a role for RasGRP1 in skin carcinogenesis.",M1
20302858,"Characterization of various promoter regions of the human DNA helicase-encoding genes and identification of duplicated ets (GGAA) motifs as an essential transcription regulatory element.DNA helicases are important in the regulation of DNA transaction and thereby various cellular functions. In this study, we developed a cost-effective multiple DNA transfection assay with DEAE-dextran reagent and analyzed the promoter activities of the human DNA helicases. The 5'-flanking regions of the human DNA helicase-encoding genes were isolated and subcloned into luciferase (Luc) expression plasmids. They were coated onto 96-well plate and used for co-transfection with a renilla-Luc expression vector into various cells, and dual-Luc assays were performed. The profiles of promoter activities were dependent on cell lines used. Among these human DNA helicase genes, XPB, RecQL5, and RTEL promoters were activated during <e>TPA</e>-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. Interestingly, duplicated ets (GGAA) elements are commonly located around the transcription start sites of these genes. The duplicated GGAA motifs are also found in the promoters of DNA replication/repair synthesis factor genes including PARG, ATR, TERC, and Rb1. Mutation analyses suggested that the duplicated GGAA-motifs are necessary for the basal promoter activity in various cells and some of them positively respond to TPA in HL-60 cells. TPA-induced response of 44-bp in the RTEL promoter was attenuated by co-transfection of the PU.1 expression vector. These findings suggest that the duplicated ets motifs regulate DNA-repair associated gene expressions during macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells.",M1
20237492,"Impaired skin regeneration and remodeling after cutaneous injury and chemically induced hyperplasia in taps-transgenic mice.Recently, we identified an AP-1-dependent target gene in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-treated mouse back skin, which encodes a retroviral-like aspartic proteinase (Taps/Asprv1). Taps expression was detected almost exclusively in stratified epithelia of mouse embryos and adult tissues, and enhanced protein levels were present in several non-neoplastic human skin disorders, implicating a crucial role for differentiation and homeostasis of multilayered epithelia. Here, we generated a mouse model in which Taps transgene expression is under the control of the human ubiquitin C promoter (UBC-Taps). Although no obvious phenotype was observed in normal skin development and homeostasis, these mice showed a significant delay in cutaneous wound closure compared with control animals. Shortly after re-epithelialization, we found an increase in keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum, which express Filaggrin, a late differentiation marker. A hypergranulosum-like phenotype with increased numbers of Filaggrin-positive keratinocytes was also observed in UBC-Taps mice after administration of TPA. In summary, these data show that aberrant Taps expression causes impaired skin regeneration and skin remodeling after cutaneous injury and chemically induced hyperplasia.",M1
20232358,"Dietary energy restriction, in part through glucocorticoid hormones, mediates the impact of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on jun D and fra-1 in Sencar mouse epidermis.Dietary energy restriction (DER, 40% calorie reduction from fat and carbohydrate) inhibited mouse skin carcinogenesis and decreased 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1):DNA binding previously. This study measured protein levels of c-jun, jun B, jun D, c-fos, fra-1, and fra-2 and examined their contribution to AP-1:DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with supershift analysis in the epidermis of control and DER Sencar mice exposed to TPA. TPA significantly increased c-jun, jun B, c-fos, fra-1, and fra-2 and decreased jun D within 3-6 h after treatment. AP-1:DNA binding reached a maximum 2.5-fold induction over controls 4 h after TPA treatment and antibodies to jun B, jun D, and fra-2 in the EMSA binding reaction resulted in supershifts in both acetone- and TPA-treated mice 1-6 h after treatment. The effect of corticosterone (CCS) and DER on the AP-1 proteins and on the composition of the AP-1:DNA complex was measured in adrenalectomized (adx) mice. DER reduced the TPA impact on jun D and enhanced the induction of fra-1. In addition, CCS-supplemented groups had significantly lower jun D and higher fra-2 than adx groups and sham groups. While sham animals treated with either acetone or TPA contained jun B, jun D, and fra-2 proteins in the AP-1:DNA complex by supershift analysis, fra-2 was no longer seen in adx DER animals. In summary, our study supports potential roles for jun D, jun B, and fra-1 in the DER regulation of AP-1 function in the Sencar mouse skin carcinogenesis model.",M1
20213728,"CARM1 activates myogenin gene via PCAF in the early differentiation of <e>TPA</e>-induced rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cells.CARM1/PRMT4 is a member of the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family. CARM1 as a transcriptional coactivator plays an active role on mammalian genes. Here, we show that CARM1 can be recruited to the promoter of myogenin gene to enhance its transcriptional activation via PCAF at the early stage of TPA-induced RD cell differentiation. By adding adenosine dialdehyde, AdOx, to inhibit the PRMT in RD cells, the TPA-induced recruiting of p300, PCAF and the Brg1 at the myogenin promoter is abolished and myogenic differentiation is blocked. More specifically, the expression of PCAF and its nucleation are prohibited when CARM1 is knockdown by its specific siRNA. We suggest that the physical interaction of CARM1 and PCAF is likely pivotal for the activation of PCAF in the downstream of CARM1 pathway for inducing myogenin under TPA-induced differentiation. The findings shed lights on novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma patients.",M1
20206692,"Down-regulation of NF-kappaB signals is involved in loss of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 responsiveness.Vitamin D anti-tumor effect is often found reduced in the late stages of cancer. To uncover vitamin D resistance mechanism, we established a vitamin D-resistant human prostate cancer LNCaP cell line, LNCaP-R, by chronic exposure of cells to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD). The vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated transcriptional activity was reduced in LNCaP-R, whereas VDR expression level and DNA-binding capacity were similar compared to parental cells (LNCaP-P). The expressions of the key factors involved in VDR transactivity, including CYP24A1 and VDR-associated proteins are all increased in LNCaP-R cells, and yet treatment with ketoconazole, P450 enzymes inhibitor, as well as trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, did not sensitize LNCaP-R cells response to vitamin D, suggesting that neither a local 1,25-VD availability, nor VDR-associated proteins are responsible for the vitamin D resistance. Interestingly, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, which is critical for 1,25-VD/VDR activity was found reduced in LNCaP-R cells, thereby treatment with NF-kappaB activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), can sensitize LNCaP-R vitamin D response. Together, we conclude that NF-kappaB signaling is critical for vitamin D sensitivity, and dysregulation of this pathway would result in vitamin D resistance and disease progression.",M1
20179211,"Diallyl trisulfide inhibits phorbol ester-induced tumor promotion, activation of AP-1, and expression of COX-2 in mouse skin by blocking JNK and Akt signaling.An inverse relationship exists between the consumption of garlic and the risk of certain cancers. The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide (DATS) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and tumor promotion in mouse skin and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment of mouse skin with different garlic-derived allyl sulfides showed DATS to be the most potent in suppressing TPA-induced COX-2 expression. DATS significantly attenuated the DNA binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1), one of the transcription factors that regulate COX-2 expression, in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. DATS also diminished TPA-induced expression of c-Jun and c-Fos, the principal components of AP-1, and blunted the activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt. Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or Akt by SP600125 or LY294002, respectively, resulted in diminished AP-1 DNA binding, reduced levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and inhibition of COX-2 expression in TPA-treated mouse skin. The JNK or Akt kinase assay, taking c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate, revealed that TPA induced JNK- or Akt-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation in mouse skin, which was significantly attenuated by DATS or respective pharmacologic inhibitors. Evaluation of antitumor-promoting effect of DATS on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated and TPA-promoted mouse skin carcinogenesis showed that pretreatment with DATS significantly reduced the incidence and multiplicity of papillomas. Taken together, the inhibitory effects of DATS on TPA-induced AP-1 activation and COX-2 expression through modulation of JNK or Akt signaling may partly account for its antitumor-promoting effect on mouse skin carcinogenesis.",M1
20172950,"Transforming growth factor beta1 enhances tumor promotion in mouse skin carcinogenesis.Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) expression is elevated by tumor promoters in the mouse skin, but its role in tumor promotion has not been well defined. To investigate this, we have compared TGFbeta1+/+ and +/- mice in a two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Surprisingly, TGFbeta1+/- mice had fewer number and incidence of benign papillomas, reduced epidermal and tumor cell proliferation and reduced epidermal TGFbeta1 and nuclear p-Smad2 localization in response to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) compared with TGFbeta1+/+ mice. Maximal TPA activation of protein kinase C (PKCalpha) as measured by activity assays and activation of target genes and induction of cornified envelopes correlated with TGFbeta1 gene dosage in keratinocytes and addition of exogenous TGFbeta1 restored the cornification defect in TGFbeta1+/- keratinocytes. Similarly, inhibition of ALK5-suppressed TPA-mediated PKCalpha activation suggesting that physiological levels of TGFbeta1 are required for maximal activation of PKC-dependent mitogenic responses. Paradoxically, the TPA-induced inflammatory response was greater in TGFbeta1+/- skin, but TGFbeta1+/+ papillomas had more tumor infiltrating myeloperoxidase-positive cells and pro-inflammatory gene expression was elevated in v-ras(Ha)-transduced TGFbeta1+/+ but not TGFbeta1+/- keratinocytes. Thus, ras activation switches TGFbeta1 to a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Despite this differential proliferative and inflammatory response to TPA and enhanced papilloma formation in the TGFbeta1+/+ mice, the frequency of malignant conversion was reduced compared with TGFbeta1+/- mice. Therefore, TGFbeta1 promotes benign tumors by modifying tumor promoter-induced cell proliferation and inflammation but retains a suppressive function for malignant conversion.",M1
20171942,"Positron emission tomography imaging of DMBA/<e>TPA</e> mouse skin multi-step tumorigenesis.Many tumor cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake that can be measured quantitatively, noninvasively and repeatedly by positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG). Clinical imaging with (18)F-FDG PET has been used for detection and staging of primary and metastatic tumors. High-resolution microPET scanning and murine cancer models make it possible to analyze longitudinally glucose metabolism during the appearance, development and progression of individual experimental tumors. In this study, we used (18)F-FDG microPET and micro computerized tomography (microCT) to investigate glucose uptake in the DMBA/TPA chemically-induced multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis model. (18)F-FDG uptake is significantly higher in all papillomas than in surrounding skin. Elevated (18)F-FDG uptake is observed when tumors can be identified morphologically, but not before. Although (18)F-FDG uptake is high in all fully invasive, malignant skin squamous cell carcinomas, uptake in papillomas and microinvasive malignant squamous cell carcinomas is variable and does not exhibit any correlation with tumor stage.",M1
20155627,"Piceatannol inhibits phorbol ester-induced NF-kappa B activation and COX-2 expression in cultured human mammary epithelial cells.There are multiple lines of evidence supporting that inflammation is causally linked to carcinogenesis. Abnormal upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme in the prostaglandin biosynthesis, has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Trans-3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxystilbene (piceatannol), a naturally occurring hydroxylated stilbene with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of several cancer cells by inducing apoptosis or blocking cell cycle progression. In this study, we examined the effect of piceatannol on activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B, one of the major transcription factors that regulate proinflammatory COX-2 gene transcription, in human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells treated with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). When pretreated to MCF-10A cells, piceatannol markedly inhibited TPA-induced NF-kappa B DNA binding to a greater extent than resveratrol and oxyresveratrol, stilbene analogs structurally related to piceatannol. Piceatannol also inhibited TPA-induced phosphorylation and degradation of Ikappa Balpha as well as nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form of p65, the functionally active subunit of NF-kappa B. Likewise, TPA-induced expression of COX-2 was abrogated by piceatannol pretreatment. The thiol reducing agent dithiothreitol abolished the inhibitory effects of piceatannol on NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, suggesting that piceatannol may directly modify NF-kappa B or its regulator through reaction with the cysteine thiol(s).",M1
20146433,"Sesquiterpenes from Maytenus jelskii as potential cancer chemopreventive agents.Seven new (1-4 and 7-9) sesquiterpenes with a dihydro-beta-agarofuran skeleton, along with four known compounds (5, 6, 10, and 11), have been isolated from the leaves of Maytenus jelskii. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by means of spectroscopic data analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR techniques, and their absolute configurations were determined by circular dichroism and chemical correlations. The compounds have been tested for their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). Compound 10 was found to be an effective antitumor-promoting agent and also showed a potent chemopreventive effect in an in vivo two-stage carcinogenesis model.",M1
20138977,"The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on tumor cell invasiveness occurs via suppression of activator protein 1 and nuclear factor-kappaB in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Hesperidin (HES) has been reported to exhibit anti-invasive and antimetastatic activities by suppressing the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). However, the underlying mechanism of anti-invasive activity remains unclear so far. First, we suggest that the expression of MMP-9 by <e>TPA</e> involves phosphorylation of IKK, p38, and PKC in hepG2. We also demonstrate that hesperidin reduced 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced cell invasion and inhibited the secreted and cytosolic MMP-9 forms in HepG2 cells. Hesperidin significantly suppressed the TPA-induced the mRNA level of MMP-9. Hesperidin suppressed MMP-9 transcription by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and Activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity. Hesperidin suppressed TPA-stimulated NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus through IkappaB inhibitory signaling pathways and also inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 activity by the inhibitory phosphorylation of p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. In conclusion, Hesperidin might be a potent antiinvasive agent that suppresses the MMP-9 enzymatic activity via NF-kappaB an AP-1 signaling pathway.",M1
20132810,"Phosphodiesterase 7A inhibitor ASB16165 impairs proliferation of keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo.Excessive proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes is a typical aspect of chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis. In the present study, the effect of phosphodiesterase 7A (PDE7A) inhibitor ASB16165 on proliferation of keratinocytes was investigated to examine the role of PDE7A in keratinocyte proliferation and the possible therapeutic relevance of PDE7A inhibition in psoriasis. Topical application of ASB16165 inhibited the increase of thickness of skin as well as epidermis in a skin inflammation model induced by repeated painting of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ASB16165 treatment also suppressed the increase in the number of Ki67-positive keratinocytes in the model, showing the disturbance of keratinocyte proliferation by the treatment. In addition, both ASB16165 and dibutyryl cAMP significantly decreased the proliferation of human keratinocytes in vitro, suggesting that PDE7A participates in keratinocyte proliferation probably by controlling intracellular cAMP, while the contribution of other mechanism(s) is not completely denied. The findings in the present study indicate that the effect of ASB16165 on skin and epidermal hyperplasia in the TPA-induced skin inflammation is mediated, at least in part, by the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation. The inhibitors for PDE7A including ASB16165 might be useful for the treatment of psoriasis.",M1
20121949,"Snail associates with EGR-1 and SP-1 to upregulate transcriptional activation of p15INK4b.Snail is a multifunctional transcriptional factor that has been described as a repressor in many different contexts. It is also proposed as an activator in a few cases relevant to tumor progression and cell-cycle arrest. This study investigated the detailed mechanisms by which Snail upregulates gene expression of the CDK inhibitor p15(INK4b) in HepG2 induced by the tumor promoter tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (<e>TPA</e>). Using deletion mapping, the TPA-responsive element on the p15(INK4b) promoter was located between 77 and 228 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site, within which the putative binding regions of early growth response gene 1 (EGR-1) and stimulatory protein 1 (SP-1) were found. Gene expression of EGR-1, Snail and SP-1 can be induced by TPA within 0.5-6 h. In addition, basal levels of SP-1, but not of the other two transcriptional factors, were observed. Blockade of TPA-induced gene expression of Snail, EGR-1 or SP-1 suppressed activation of the p15-pro228 reporter plasmid harboring the TPA-responsive element. More detailed deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis further concluded that the overlapping EGR-1/SP-1-binding site was required for TPA-induced p15-pro228 activation. In an EMSA, a DNA-protein complex was elevated by TPA, which can be blocked by antibodies against EGR-1, SP-1 or Snail at 6 h. Immunoprecipitation/western blotting demonstrated that TPA could trigger the association of EGR-1 with Snail or SP-1. Furthermore, a double chromatin immunoprecipitation assay verified that EGR-1 could form a complex with Snail or SP-1 on the TPA-responsive element after treatment with TPA for 2-6 h. Finally, we demonstrated a novel Snail-target region which could be bound by Snail and was also required for TPA-induced p15-pro228 activation. In conclusion, Snail associates with EGR-1 and SP-1 to mediate TPA-induced transcriptional upregulation of p15(INK4b) in HepG2.",M1
20107497,"Mitochondrial localization of vitamin D receptor in human platelets and differentiated megakaryocytes.BACKGROUND: Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D elicits both transcriptional events and rapid non genomic effects. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) localization and mechanisms of VDR-triggered non genomic responses are still controversial. Although anticoagulant effects of vitamin D have been reported and VDR signalling has been characterized in monocytes and vascular cells, nothing is known about VDR expression and functions in human platelets, anucleated fragments of megakaryocytes which are known targets of other steroids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we characterized the expression and cellular localization of VDR in human platelets and in a megakaryocyte lineage. Human platelets and their <e>TPA</e>-differentiated precursors expressed a classical 50 kDa VDR protein, which increased with megakaryocytes maturation. By biochemical fractionation studies we demonstrated the presence of the receptor in the soluble and mitochondrial compartment of human platelets, and the observation was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy analysis. Similar localization was found in mature megakaryocytes, where besides its classical nuclear localization the receptor was evident as soluble and mitochondria resident protein. CONCLUSIONS: The results reported here suggest that megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet activation, which are calcium-dependent events, might be modulated by a mitochondrial non genomic activity of VDR. These data open challenging future studies on VDR physiological role in platelets and more generally in mitochondria.",M1
20094874,"Assay systems for measurement of anti-inflammatory activity.It is widely accepted that cationic antimicrobial peptides possess potent microbicidal properties. Recent studies show that in addition to their antimicrobial action, these peptides can exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. The purpose of this chapter is to describe in vivo ear inflammation models that can be used for evaluating the anti-inflammatory activity of antimicrobial peptides. The models are based on different mechanisms of inflammation development and include irritant dermatitis (a model induced by a single application of 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate [<e>TPA</e>]) and allergic dermatitis, or delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (a model induced by repetitive application of oxazolone).",M1
20047593,"Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phosphorylation promotes cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and metastasis via the protein kinase C-dependent pathway.Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) has been suggested to be implicated in cell adhesion, secretion, and motility through the regulation of the actin cytoskeletal structure. The quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that MARCKS is significantly overexpressed in Opisthorchis viverrini-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) (P = 0.001) in a hamster model, which correlated with the results of mRNA in situ hybridization. An immunohistochemical analysis of 60 CCA patients revealed a significant increase of MARCKS expression. Moreover, the log-rank analysis indicated that CCA patients with a high MARCKS expression have significantly shorter survival times than those with a low MARCKS expression (P = 0.02). This study investigated whether MARCKS overexpression is associated with CCA metastasis. Using a confocal microscopic analysis of CCA cell lines that had been stimulated with the PKC activator, 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), MARCKS was found to be translocated from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear area. In addition, phosphorylated MARCKS (pMARCKS) became highly concentrated in the perinuclear area. Moreover, an adhesion assay demonstrated that the exogenous overexpression of MARCKS remarkably promoted cell attachment. Interestingly, after TPA stimulation, the CCA cell line-depleted MARCKS showed a decrease in migration and invasion activity. It can be concluded that in non-stimulation, MARCKS promotes cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. After TPA stimulation, PKC phosphorylates MARCKS leading to cell migration or invasion. Taken together, the results of this study reveal a prominent role for MARCKS as one of the key players in the migration of CCA cells and suggest that cycling between MARCKS and pMARCKS can regulate the metastasis of biliary cancer cells.",M1
20045496,"Studies on glyphosate-induced carcinogenicity in mouse skin: a proteomic approach.Glyphosate is a widely used broad spectrum herbicide, reported to induce various toxic effects in non-target species, but its carcinogenic potential is still unknown. Here we showed the carcinogenic effects of glyphosate using 2-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model and proteomic analysis. Carcinogenicity study revealed that glyphosate has tumor promoting activity. Proteomic analysis using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry showed that 22 spots were differentially expressed (&gt;2 fold) on glyphosate, 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) application over untreated control. Among them, 9 proteins (translation elongation factor eEF-1 alpha chain, carbonic anhydrase III, annexin II, calcyclin, fab fragment anti-VEGF antibody, peroxiredoxin-2, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], stefin A3, and calgranulin-B) were common and showed similar expression pattern in glyphosate and TPA-treated mouse skin. These proteins are known to be involved in several key processes like apoptosis and growth-inhibition, anti-oxidant responses, etc. The up-regulation of calcyclin, calgranulin-B and down-regulation of superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] was further confirmed by immunoblotting, indicating that these proteins can be good candidate biomarkers for skin carcinogenesis induced by glyphosate. Altogether, these results suggested that glyphosate has tumor promoting potential in skin carcinogenesis and its mechanism seems to be similar to TPA.",M1
20043135,"Cordycepin inhibits <e>TPA</e>-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression by suppressing the MAPK/AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which degrades the extracellular matrix (ECM), plays an important role in breast cancer cell invasion. NF-kappaB and AP-1 are known to induce MMP-9 expression. We investigated whether cordycepin, an NF-kappaB or AP-1 inhibitor, can modulate MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells. Toxicity of cordycepin was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MMP-9 expression was determined by real-time PCR, Zymography, and Western blot analysis. AP-1 activation was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). MAPK signaling was evaluated by Western blotting with specific p-ERK, and ERK, p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK antibodies. Cordycepin suppressed AP-1 activation, but not NF-kappaB activation in 12-O-tetradecanoylpho-bol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated MCF-7 cells. Cordycepin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion by suppressing AP-1 activation. Also, cordycepin suppressed the MAPK signaling pathway. Cordycepin is a potent inhibitor of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and blocks strongly the ability of AP-1 activation via MAPK signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells.",M1
20033916,"The use of tetradecanoylphorbol acetate-stimulated peripheral blood cells enhances the prognostic value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) studies have a remarkable prognostic value in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). I-FISH studies can be performed either on tetradecanoylphorbol acetate stimulated peripheral blood cells (I-FISH-<e>TPA</e>) or unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (I-FISH-PBMC). The aim of the study was to evaluate whether this finding was clinically relevant in a group of 235 patients with CLL. Fifty-six patients had both I-FISH-TPA and I-FISH-PBMC results. Compared with uncultured cells, the cytogenetic detection rate rose from 57 to 80% with the use of TPA-stimulated cells (P = 0.014). I-FISH-TPA provided a better prediction of treatment-free survival compared with I-FISH-PBMC (P = 0.031 vs. 0.166). Then, I-FISH-PBMC results from 93 historical patients were compared with 86 recent patients with I-FISH-TPA results. Genomic aberrations were detected in 46 and 67% of patients from the I-FISH-PBMC and I-FISH-TPA cohorts, respectively. The detection rate of 13q deletion as the only aberration increased from 10% with I-FISH-PBMC to 37% with I-FISH-TPA (P = 0.006). In conclusion, I-FISH-TPA increased the detection rate of 13q deletion and had an improved prognostic value compared with I-FISH-PBMC.",M1
20026373,"Naturally occurring phenolic acids inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced NF-kappaB, iNOS and COX-2 activation in mouse epidermis.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring protocatechuic, chlorogenic and tannic acids on the skin tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), induced NF-kappaB in mouse epidermis. The topical application of these phenolics 15min prior to TPA resulted in a significant decrease in the NF-kappaB activation which was measured in terms of p65-DNA binding. Tannic acid was the most potent inhibitor of the TPA-stimulated p65-DNA binding, while chlorogenic acid was the least effective compound. Tannic acid also reduced the most the NF-kappaB p65 subunit translocation from cytosol to the nucleus and enhanced the retention of IkappaBalpha in the cytosol. Although protocatechuic acid decreased p65-DNA binding, it did not affect TPA-stimulated degradation of IkappaBalpha. All the tested compounds inhibited the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) activity in mouse epidermis. Tannic acid was the most potent inhibitor and protocatechuic acid the weakest. Tannic and chlorogenic acids reduced the TPA-induced C-L activity of proteasome 20S to a similar extent. The blockade of upstream kinase IKK signaling by tannic acid, but also by protocatechuic acid, inhibited the enzyme level and the activity of COX-2. Protocatechuic acid also diminished the level and activity of TPA-induced iNOS, which might be related to its weak effect on IkappaBalpha degradation. Our earlier studies demonstrated that these compounds, particularly tannic acid, reduced the formation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in vitro and in vivo in mouse epidermis. The results of our present study indicate that the compounds which reduce the formation of electrophilic PAH metabolites may also diminish NF-kappaB activation. Thus, the phenolic acids, particularly tannic acid, by affecting the key events of initiation and promotion stage of carcinogenesis, have become of great interest for the prevention of cancer.",M1
20016498,"Basic fibroblast growth factor regulates persistent ERK oscillations in premalignant but not malignant JB6 cells.The regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) oscillations in the context of wound healing and carcinogenesis have been investigated in premalignant and malignant JB6 mouse epidermal cells stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). In premalignant JB6 cells, bFGF stimulation (1) increases cellular phospho-ERK and phospho-c-Jun levels, (2) increases serum-dependent cell proliferation, (3) induces an apparent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and (4) induces the persistent nuclear-cytosolic oscillation of an ERK1-green fluorescent protein (ERK1-GFP) chimera. In contrast, TPA induces persistent activation of ERK in the absence of oscillations and does not induce efficient migration. Treatment of malignant or transformed JB6 cells with bFGF is associated with a transient nuclear translocation of ERK1-GFP but not oscillations or efficient cell migration. Our data suggest that bFGF regulates ERK oscillations in premalignant but not malignant JB6 cells.",M1
20004183,"Purification of a peptide from seahorse, that inhibits <e>TPA</e>-induced MMP, iNOS and COX-2 expression through MAPK and NF-kappaB activation, and induces human osteoblastic and chondrocytic differentiation.Ongoing efforts to search for naturally occurring, bioactive substances for the amelioration of arthritis have led to the discovery of natural products with substantial bioactive properties. The seahorse (Hippocampus kuda Bleeler), a telelost fish, is one source of known beneficial products, yet has not been utilized for arthritis research. In the present work, we have purified and characterized a bioactive peptide from seahorse hydrolysis. Among the hydrolysates tested, pronase E-derived hydrolysate exhibited the highest alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a phenotype marker of osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation. After its separation from the hydrolysate by several purification steps, the peptide responsible for the ALP activity was isolated and its sequence was identified as LEDPFDKDDWDNWK (1821Da). We have shown that the isolated peptide induces differentiation of osteoblastic MG-63 and chondrocytic SW-1353 cells by measuring ALP activity, mineralization and collagen synthesis. Our results indicate that the peptide acts during early to late stages of differentiation in MG-63 and SW-1353 cells. We also assessed the concentration dependence of the peptide's inhibition of MMP (-1, -3 and -13), iNOS and COX-2 expression after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a common form of phorbol ester. The peptide also inhibited NO production in MG-63 and SW-1353 cells. To elucidate the mechanisms by which the peptide acted, we examined its effects on TPA-induced MAPKs/NF-kappaB activation and determined that the peptide treatment significantly reduced p38 kinase/NF-kappaB in MG-63 cells and MAPKs/NF-kappaB in SW-1353 cells.",M1
19945525,"Defective <e>TPA</e> signalling compromises HaCat cells as a human in vitro skin carcinogenesis model.HaCat cells, a human keratinocyte line, are commonly utilised as an in vitro cell model for toxicity testing and the discernment of processes of chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. Here, as part of an ongoing program of carcinogenesis research, we tested the genomic transcriptional response of two keratinocyte cell lines HaCat (human) and Pam212 (mouse) to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), one of the most studied skin carcinoma promoting agents, and compared this with the response in primary keratinocytes. Differences in the genomic response profile indicated an insufficiency in the MEK/ERK pathway signalling in HaCat but not Pam212 cells compared to primary keratinocytes. TPA can also activate NFkappaB and so we tested whether this was also deficient in the HaCat cells using TNFalpha which signals directly to NFkappaB. By this method NFkappaB was found to be equally active in both HaCat and Pam212 cells. Analysis of ERK phosphorylation showed that while TPA mediated ERK phosphorylation occurred in both cell lines it was more robust and difficult to inhibit in Pam212 cells suggesting that there may be an insufficiency in this step in HaCat cells leading to a reduced response. Overall these data indicate that caution should be employed when using HaCat cells as an in vitro skin model for biochemical research or toxicological evaluation.",M1
19944733,"Anti-inflammatory activity of seed essential oil from Zizyphus jujuba.This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of essential oil from seeds of Zizyphus jujuba on <e>TPA</e>-induced skin inflammation in experimental mice. Exposure of TPA on the ear of the BALB/c mice caused a marked increase in both ear thickness and skin water content. The ear thickness was measured for TPA-induced ear was 0.54 mm, as compared to control (0.23 mm). Treatment with 1% and 10% of essential oil caused significant decrease in ear thicknesses which were measured to be 0.30 and 0.35 mm, as well as reduce the water content about 51% and 53% in the TPA-induced skin inflammation model, respectively. Furthermore, histological analysis clearly confirmed that Z. jujuba essential oil inhibited the inflammatory responses of skin inflammation in animal model. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the essential oil of Z. jujuba seeds might accelerate the development of new drugs for various inflammatory diseases.",M1
19919952,"Protein phosphatase 1alpha associates with protein tyrosine phosphatase-PEST inducing dephosphorylation of phospho-serine 39.Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST is expressed in a wide variety of several cell types and is an efficient regulator of cell adhesion, spreading and migration. PTP-PEST-associating molecules are important in elucidating the function of PTP-PEST. Herein, we have identified protein phosphatase 1alpha (PP1alpha) as a novel PTP-PEST binding protein, and then we aimed to determine how PP1alpha contributes to the phosphorylation at Ser39 of PTP-PEST, whose phosphorylation suppresses PTP-PEST enzymatic activity. The HEK 293 cells overexpressing exogenous PTP-PEST were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) and the phosphorylation of PTP-PEST at Ser39 was evaluated using an anti-phospho-Ser39 PTP-PEST specific antibody (anti-pS39-PEST Ab). It was demonstrated that the phosphorylation at Ser39 detected by anti-pS39-PEST Ab was dependent on TPA treatment and a significant inverse correlation between the PTP activity of PTP-PEST and anti-pS39-PEST Ab-immunoreactive band intensity. The phosphorylation of Ser39 was suppressed by co-transfection of a plasmid encoding wild-type PP1alpha, but not by that of the dominant-negative PP1alpha mutant. Furthermore, TPA-induced phosphorylation could take place in PTP-PEST catalytic domain, but the phosphorylation of PTP-PEST catalytic domain could not be abrogated by co-transfection of a plasmid expressing wild-type PP1alpha. In conclusion, PP1alpha associates with the non-catalytic domain of PTP-PEST and regulates PTP activity via dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser39.",M1
19910455,"Retinoic acid is a cofactor for translational regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in human endometrial stromal cells.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endometrial angiogenesis play a critical role in successful embryonic implantation. Despite many studies of the effects of estrogen and progesterone on VEGF expression, its focal regulation at the site of implantation is unknown. Retinoic acid (RA) has been reported to regulate VEGF in a variety of cell types. Because localized RA synthesis occurs within the periimplantation endometrium, we tested the possibility that RA regulates VEGF production in endometrial stromal cells. Using primary and telomerase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells, we determined that RA alone did not alter constitutive levels of VEGF production, but markedly amplified secretion when the cells were cotreated with activators of VEGF gene transcription (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, <e>TPA</e>; TGF-beta; and IL-1beta). Whereas TPA or TGF-beta alone stimulated VEGF promoter activity and up-regulated mRNA levels, significant protein secretion was detected only after RA was added to the culture systems. Analysis of retinoids in secretory phase endometrial biopsies indicated that endogenous RA accumulated at concentrations sufficient to induce VEGF secretion. Polyribosome profile analysis showed that the addition of RA to transcriptional activators of VEGF shifted the translational suppressed VEGF mRNA transcripts into larger polyribosome complexes engaged in active translation. Although the precise mechanism(s) of the RA effect remains to be defined, it appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen species; the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited RA+TPA-stimulated secretion of VEGF by more than 80%. Together, our results demonstrate that in human endometrial stromal cells, RA can combine with transcriptional activators of VEGF to augment VEGF secretion through a translational mechanism of action mediated by reactive oxygen species. These findings suggest a link between the spatiotemporal changes of retinoid synthesis in the periimplantation stroma and the capacity to quickly up-regulate focal VEGF secretion needed to induce early angiogenic events of pregnancy.",M1
19888641,"The anti-inflammatory effects of a methanolic extract from Radix Isatidis in murine macrophages and mice.Radix Isatidis is the dried root of the plant Isatidis indigotica Fort (family Cruciferae) and traditionally used as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-endotoxic, and immune regulatory agent in the folk medicine of Korea and China. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of methanolic extracts of Radix Isatidis (RIME) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages and in a <e>TPA</e>-induced ear edema animal model. Anti-inflammatory effects of RIME were examined in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In order to investigate the effects of RIME in vivo, activation of myeloperoxidase, and histological assessment were examined in the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema model. RIME significantly inhibited the release from macrophages of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E(2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical administration of RIME at 1-5 mg/ear resulted in reduction of ear inflammation in mice. Thus, our results indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of RIME involve decreased production of inflammatory mediators, which suggests that RIME may have therapeutic potential in a variety of inflammation-related diseases.",M1
19840844,"Comparison of gene expression profiles in BALB/c 3T3 transformed foci exposed to tumor promoting agents.Identification of specific etiological carcinogens is one of the most important issues in environmental-toxicology studies. In this study, cDNA microarrays were used to analyze gene expression and discern chemical-associated profiles induced by a variety of tumor promoting agents in transformed cells. Two-stage transformation model of BALB/c 3T3 cells was established with MNNG as initiator, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), okadaic acid (OA), or cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) as tumor promoters. Nine morphologically transformed foci were isolated and the anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells was verified. The gene expression alterations in foci were evaluated using cDNA microarray with 1796 mouse genes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the nine foci were classified into three groups in concordance with the promoters used to induce them and characteristic clusters of genes were identified. In these clusters, genes associated with oxidative stress were specially upregulated following distinct promoter exposure. Moreover, common gene expression alterations were also observed in foci, including upregulated genes associated with cell proliferation and downregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix. Our results demonstrate the presence of unique gene expression profiles in transformed cells which reflect the etiological chemicals and indicate the importance of characteristic molecular alterations as potential biomarkers of exposure to tumor promoters.",M1
19835876,"PKC mediates GnRH activation of a Na+/H+ exchanger in goldfish somatotropes.Previous results suggest that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation of somatotropin secretion in goldfish involves activation of Na(+)/H(+) exchange (NHE). We tested the hypothesis that GnRH alkalinizes intracellular pH (pH(i)) via protein kinase C (PKC) activation of NHE. Two types of alkalinization responses were observed in identified goldfish somatotropes preloaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF; the rate of pH(i) changes went from a neutral or slightly negative slope to either a positive or a less negative slope relative to control. Two GnRHs, the PKC-activating <e>TPA</e>, and dioctanoyl glycerol each caused an alkalinization in 70-90% of somatotropes. The PKC inhibitors, Bis II and Gö6976, the NHE inhibitor amiloride, or Na(+)-free solution attenuated TPA and GnRHs actions, suggesting that PKC mediates GnRH activation of NHE. Since amiloride and Na(+)-free solution caused acidification in somatotropes at rest, regulation of basal pH(i) in these cells likely involves Na(+) flux through amiloride-sensitive NHE.",M1
19808857,"MK2 regulates the early stages of skin tumor promotion.The association between inflammation and tumorigenesis is well recognized. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2) is known to play a pivotal role in inflammatory processes. Here, we studied the effect of MK2-deficiency and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-deficiency on skin tumor development in mice using the two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model. We found that MK2(-/-) mice developed significantly fewer skin tumors compared with both TNF-alpha(-/-) and wild-type mice when induced by initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). The TPA-induced inflammatory response was reduced in both, TNF-alpha(-/-) mice and MK2(-/-) mice, but most pronounced in TNF-alpha(-/-) mice, indicating that a reduced inflammatory response was not the only explanation for the inhibited tumorigenesis seen in MK2(-/-) mice. Interestingly, increased numbers of apoptotic cells were detected in the epidermis of MK2(-/-) mice compared with TNF-alpha(-/-) and wild-type mice, suggesting an additional role of MK2 in the regulation of apoptosis. This was further supported by: (i) increased levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in MK2(-/-) mice after DMBA/TPA treatment compared with controls, (ii) reduced phosphorylation (activation) of the negative p53 regulator, murine double minute 2 in MK2(-)(/-) mouse keratinocytes in vitro and (iii) a significant decrease in the DMBA/TPA induced apoptosis in cultured MK2(-/-) keratinocytes transfected with p53 small interfering RNA. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a dual role of MK2 in the early stages of tumor promotion through regulation of both the inflammatory response and apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells. These results also identify MK2 as a putative target for future skin carcinoma therapy.",M1
19787145,"High expression of the circadian gene mPer2 diminishes the radiosensitivity of NIH 3T3 cells.Period2 is a core circadian gene, which not only maintains the circadian rhythm of cells but also regulates some organic functions. We investigated the effects of mPeriod2 (mPer2) expression on radiosensitivity in normal mouse cells exposed to 60Co-gamma-rays. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) to induce endogenous mPer2 expression or transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-mPer2 and irradiated with 60Co-gamma-rays, and then analyzed by several methods such as flow cytometry, colony formation assay, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry and colony formation assay revealed that irradiated NIH 3T3 cells expressing high levels of mPer2 showed a lower death rate (TPA: 24 h 4.3% vs 12 h 6.8% and control 9.4%; transfection: pcDNA3.1-mPer2 3.7% vs pcDNA3.1 11.3% and control 8.2%), more proliferation and clonogenic survival (TPA: 121.7 +/- 6.51 vs 66.0 +/- 3.51 and 67.7 +/- 7.37; transfection: 121.7 +/- 6.50 vs 65.3 +/- 3.51 and 69.0 +/- 4.58) both when treated with TPA and transfected with mPer2. RT-PCR analysis showed an increased expression of bax, bcl-2, p53, c-myc, mre11, and nbs1, and an increased proportionality of bcl-2/bax in the irradiated cells at peak mPer2 expression compared with cells at trough mPer2 expression and control cells. However, no significant difference in rad50 expression was observed among the three groups of cells. Immunohistochemistry also showed increased protein levels of P53, BAX and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in irradiated cells with peak mPer2 levels. Thus, high expression of the circadian gene mPer2 may reduce the radiosensitivity of NIH 3T3 cells. For this effect, mPer2 may directly or indirectly regulate the expressions of cell proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes and DNA repair-related genes.",M1
19768635,"Plumbagin inhibits <e>TPA</e>-induced MMP-2 and u-PA expressions by reducing binding activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 via ERK signaling pathway in A549 human lung cancer cells.This study first investigates the anti-metastatic effect of plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMPs and u-PA expressions in human lung cancer cells, A549. First, the result demonstrated plumbagin could inhibit TPA induced the abilities of the adhesion, invasion, and migration by cell-matrix adhesion assay and Boyden chamber assay. Data also showed plumbagin could inhibit the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) involved in the down-regulating enzyme activities, protein and messenger RNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) induced by TPA. Next, plumbagin also strongly inhibited TPA-induced phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), and the nuclear levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), c-Fos, and c-Jun. Also, a dose-dependent inhibition on the binding abilities of NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) by plumbagin treatment was further observed. Further, the treatment of specific inhibitor for ERK (U0126) to A549 cells could inhibit TPA-induced MMP-2 and u-PA expressions along with an inhibition on cell invasion and migration. Presented data reveals that plumbagin is a novel, effective, anti-metastatic agent that functions by down-regulating MMP-2 and u-PA gene expressions.",M1
19760383,"Benzyl isothiocyanate exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in murine macrophages and in mouse skin.Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is detected in abundance in Brassica vegetables, and some previous studies have demonstrated that BITC may potentially function as a chemopreventive agent in humans. This study examined whether BITC inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in Raw 264.7 macrophages and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced ear edema formation. The treatment of macrophages with various concentrations of BITC resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the LPS-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 and their corresponding mRNA levels, as well as in the production of nitric oxide and PGE(2). Consistent with these findings, BITC inhibited the LPS-induced expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 proteins and their corresponding mRNAs. BITC inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of the inhibitor of kappaBalpha, translocation of p65 into the nucleus, and the DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity of NFkappaB. Moreover, the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and Akt was suppressed by BITC. BITC also inhibited ear edema formation and the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 in mouse skin treated with TPA. We demonstrate that BITC is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, and the anti-inflammatory properties of BITC may result from the downregulation of NFkappaB signaling.",M1
19759192,"IL-12 deficiency suppresses 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin tumor development in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated mouse skin through inhibition of inflammation.Interleukin (IL)-12 deficiency exacerbates tumorigenesis in ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin. Here, we assessed the effects of IL-12 deficiency on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced tumor promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mouse skin. Using this two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol, we found that the development of DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumors was diminished in IL-12p40-knockout mice than in their wild-type counterparts. At the termination of the experiment (at 24 weeks), the skin tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.005) in interleukin-12-knockout (IL-12 KO) mice than in their wild-type counterparts, as was the malignant transformation of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas to carcinomas (P &lt; 0.01). Analysis of samples collected at the termination of the experiments for biomarkers of inflammation by immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed significantly lower levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin (PG) E(2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1 and the proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) in the DMBA/TPA-treated tumors and tumor-uninvolved skin of IL-12 KO mice than the skin and tumors of DMBA/TPA-treated wild-type mice. Analysis of the skin 6 h after TPA treatment showed that the TPA-induced promotion of skin edema, inflammatory leukocyte infiltration, COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production was significantly lower in the skin of the IL-12-KO mice than their wild-type counterparts. These results indicate that DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumor development differs from UVB-induced skin tumor development in that endogenous IL-12 acts to inhibit UVB-induced skin tumor development and malignant progression of the skin tumors to carcinoma. In the case of DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumor development, the endogenous IL-12 modulates the tumor promoter stimulation of inflammatory responses.",M1
19755658,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) is required for tumor initiation by benzo[a]pyrene.Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). After binding ligand, Ahr dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein, and the dimer upregulates the transcription of Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1 and other enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of B[a]P. Arnt null mice die in utero. Mice in which Arnt deletion occurs constitutively in the epidermis die perinatally. In the current study, mice were developed in which the Arnt gene could be deleted specifically in adult skin epidermis. This deletion had no overt pathological effect. Homozygosity for a null reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate): quinone oxidoreductase allele was introduced into the above mouse strain to render it more susceptible to tumor initiation by B[a]P. Deletion of Arnt in the epidermis of this strain completely prevented the induction of skin tumors in a tumor initiation-promotion protocol in which a single topical application of B[a]P acted as the tumor-initiating event, and tumor promotion was provided by repeated topical applications of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). In contrast, deletion of Arnt did not prevent the induction of skin tumors in a protocol also using TPA as the promoter but using as the initiator N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, whose activity is unlikely to be affected by the activity of Ahr, Arnt or their target genes. These observations demonstrate that Arnt is required for tumor initiation by B[a]P in this system.",M1
19755418,"12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibits melanoma growth by inactivation of STAT3 through protein kinase C-activated tyrosine phosphatase(s).The growth of most melanoma cells in vitro is inhibited by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). In this study, the involvement of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the TPA-induced growth inhibition of melanoma cells was examined. The in vitro growth and DNA synthesis of five melanoma cell lines, whose STAT3 was activated (phosphorylated), was inhibited by TPA, whereas that of WM35 and WM39 cells, whose STAT3 activity was at negligible levels, was considerably slow and not affected by TPA. Blockade of STAT3 activity by small interfering RNAs suppressed the growth of WM1205Lu cells containing constitutively activated STAT3. Treatment of WM1205Lu cells with TPA decreased both the phosphorylated STAT3 and the DNA-binding activity of STAT3. Pretreatment of WM1205Lu cells with either a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor or a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor prevented the inhibitory effects of TPA on the level of phosphorylated STAT3. The five melanoma cell lines containing phosphorylated STAT3 commonly expressed PKCalpha, PKCdelta, and PKCepsilon. Introduction of the dominant negative mutant of one of these PKC isoforms into WM1205Lu cells inhibited the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. A Src inhibitor attenuated the STAT3 phosphorylation in WM1205Lu cells. These results indicate that constitutively activated STAT3 is positively regulated by c-Src and negatively regulated by a PKC-activated tyrosine phosphatase(s) in melanoma cells. Because TPA did not affect c-Src activity, we conclude that the growth inhibitory effect of TPA on melanoma cells is mediated through inactivation of STAT3 by a PKC-activated tyrosine phosphatase(s).",M1

19723105,"Effects of cotreatment of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and H2O2 on apoptotic regulation via AMP-activated protein kinase-cyclooxygenase-2 signals.Colorectal cancer displays elevated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and several studies have suggested that COX-2 expression is associated with parameters of aggressive colon cancer. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status, and recent studies indicate that AMPK activation strongly suppresses cell proliferation in nonmalignant cells as well as in tumor cells. As a metabolic sensing signal, AMPK is involved in cancer cell apoptosis. In HT-29 colon cancer cells, the regulation of COX-2 expression by treating with <e>TPA</e> (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), low-level H(2)O(2), high-level H(2)O(2), and finally the combinations of TPA and low H(2)O(2) or high H(2)O(2) was investigated. We found that COX-2 expression levels with treatment reacted as follows: with TPA alone &gt; TPA and low H(2)O(2) &gt; low H(2)O(2) &gt; high H(2)O(2) &gt; TPA and high H(2)O(2). COX-2 regulation by these agents was accompanied by the alteration of AMPK control. The apoptotic bodies were detected as follows: high level of H(2)O(2) &gt; TPA &gt; low level of H(2)O(2). The present findings suggest that both COX-2 stimulators (TPA and H(2)O(2)) might have differential effects on COX-2 and AMPK regulation and further apoptotic regulation.",M1
19723084,"Anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effect of genistein alone or in combination with capsaicin in <e>TPA</e>-treated rat mammary glands or mammary cancer cell line.The topical application of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) to animal skin or direct treatment of TPA to cell cultures leads to inflammatory responses by enhancing cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression, and specific COX-2 inhibitors counteract this kind of inflammatory response. Furthermore, suppression of these inflammatory events by dietary-origin chemopreventive agents can provide a potential strategy to control carcinogenesis. In this in vivo study, the mammary glands of mature female rats were treated with TPA, and then the effects of genistein alone or in combination with capsaicin on suppression of inflammatory responses were examined. The combined effects of genistein and capsaicin on COX-2, pJNK, pERK, and pp38 expressions were additive or nonadditive, depending on signals tested. In vitro MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the apoptotic bodies as shown with Hoechst 33342 dye, exhibited a synergistic effect between genistein and capsaicin. The abilities of genistein alone or in combination with capsaicin in inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation through the modulation of AMPK and COX-2 were tested. AMPK activation by genistein in combination with capsaicin is critical for inhibiting COX-2. We propose that genistein in combination with capsaicin exerts anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties through the modulation of AMPK and COX-2 and possibly various mitogen-activated protein kinases synergistically or nonsynergistically.",M1
19715751,"Silibinin prevents <e>TPA</e>-induced MMP-9 expression by down-regulation of COX-2 in human breast cancer cells.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are pivotal steps in breast cancer pathogenesis. In a previous study, we reported that silibinin suppresses TPA-induced MMP-9 expression through the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Herein we determined the co-relationship between MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as the effect of silibinin on 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 and COX-2 expression in the human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. METHODS: The toxicity of silibinin was evaluated by Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit II. MMP-9 and COX-2 expression were analyzed by Zymography and Western blotting, respectively. Adenoviral constitutively active (CA)-MEK was used to activate MEK/ERK pathway. RESULTS: The expression of MMP-9 and COX-2 in response to TPA was increased, whereas TPA-induced MMP-9 and COX-2 expression was decreased by silibinin. Our results showed that TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was inhibited by celecoxib in a dose-dependent fashion, but not MMP-1-expression. Both MMP-9 and COX-2 expression were significantly increased by CA-MEK overexpression. In contrast, TPA-induced MMP-9 and COX-2 expression was decreased by UO126 (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). CONCLUSION: Silibinin down-regulates TPA-induced MMP-9 expression through inhibition of COX-2 expression in breast cancer cells.",M1
19703349,"Relative inhibitory activity of bile acids against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced inflammation, and chenodeoxycholic acid inhibition of tumour promotion in mouse skin two-stage carcinogenesis.OBJECTIVES: Bile acids are present in Bezoar Bovis and Fel Ursi, traditionally used as antipyretics and antispasmodics. However the anti-inflammatory activity of individual bile acids and related compounds has not yet been investigated. In this paper, we report the structure-activity relationships influencing the anti-inflammatory activity of a variety of structurally different bile acid derivatives and also the inhibitory activity of chenodeoxycholic acid against tumour promotion. METHODS: Fifty derivatives of bile acids were examined for their inhibitory activity against the induction of oedema in mouse ear by application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). Also, the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid was studied in mouse skin in which tumours had been induced by topical application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and promoted by TPA. KEY FINDINGS: Many bile acid derivatives had an inhibitory effect against TPA-induced ear oedema at a similar grade to that of indometacin. Chenodeoxycholic acid, methyl 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oate and methyl 3alpha,7alpha,15beta-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oate showed the most potent activity with an ID50 value of 71-110 nmol/ear, a level corresponding to that of hydrocortisone (69 nmol/ear). Furthermore, chenodeoxycholic acid markedly suppressed tumour-promoting activity by TPA following initiation by DMBA in mouse skin. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the anti-inflammatory activity of bile acids on TPA-induced inflammatory ear oedema in mice. Chenodeoxycholic acid, methyl 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oate and methyl 3alpha,7alpha,15beta-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oate showed the most potent activity, at a level corresponding to that of hydrocortisone.

19693770,"The activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 induced by protein kinase C alpha in decidualization.This study investigated the protein kinase C (PKC) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the development of deciduomata in pseudo-pregnant and pregnant rats. The results showed that the expression of MMP-2 was significantly increased from day 2 to day 5 in pseudo-pregnancy and from day 7 to day 9 in pregnancy. To further investigate the correlation between MMP-2 and protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha), the expression of MMP-2 in the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-treated organotypic culture of decidual tissue was determined. The results showed that the active form of MMP-2 was significantly increased in the TPA-treated cultures. Moreover, this response was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor H7, the PKC alpha specific inhibitor Gö-6976 and the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, but not by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the replication inhibitor mitomycin C. In addition, TPA also reversed the MMP-2 expression after by progesterone pretreatment in the primary decidual cells. These findings indicate that PKC alpha may play an important role in the regulation of the MMP-2 expression during decidualization.",M1
19672456,"50 Hz extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields enhance protein carbonyl groups content in cancer cells: effects on proteasomal systems.Electromagnetic fields are an assessed cause of prolonging free radicals lifespan. This study was carried out to investigate the influence of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields on protein oxidation and on the 20S proteasome functionality, the complex responsible for the degradation of oxidized proteins. Caco 2 cells were exposed, for 24-72 hours, to 1 mT, 50 Hz electromagnetic fields. The treatment induced a time-dependent increase both in cell growth and in protein oxidation, more evident in the presence of <e>TPA</e>, while no changes in cell viability were detected. Exposing the cells to 50 Hz electromagnetic fields caused a global activation of the 20S proteasome catalytic components, particularly evident at 72 hours exposure and in the presence of TPA. The finding that EGCG, a natural antioxidant compound, counteracted the field-related pro-oxidant effects demonstrates that the increased proteasome activity was due to an enhancement in intracellular free radicals.",M1
19657354,"The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 in the p38/TNF-alpha pathway of systemic and cutaneous inflammation.Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) is a downstream molecule of p38, involved in the production of TNF-alpha, a key cytokine, and an established drug target for many inflammatory diseases. We investigated the role of MK2 in skin inflammation to determine its drug target potential. MK2 deficiency significantly decreased plasma TNF-alpha levels after systemic endotoxin application. Deficient mice showed decreased skin edema formation in chronic 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced irritative dermatitis and in subacute 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced contact hypersensitivity. Surprisingly, MK2 deficiency did not inhibit edema formation in subacute 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced contact allergy and even increased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels as well as granulocyte infiltration in diseased ears. Ear inflammation in this model, however, was inhibited by TNF-alpha neutralization as it was in the subacute DNFB model. MK2 deficiency also did not show anti-inflammatory effects in acute DNFB-induced contact hypersensitivity, whereas the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated skin inflammation supporting a pathophysiological role of p38. When evaluating possible mechanisms, we found that TNF-alpha production in MK2-deficient spleen cells was strongly diminished after TLR stimulation but less affected after T-cell receptor stimulation. Our data suggest that MK2, in contrast to its downstream effector molecule, TNF-alpha, has a rather elusive role in T-cell-dependent cutaneous inflammation.",M1
19639210,"Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase expression by menatetrenone, a vitamin K2 analogue.Vitamin K2 (VK2) has been shown to have a potent anti-tumor effect against several cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, but it is not known whether VK2 regulates the expression of MMPs. Human HCC cell lines were treated with VK2 combined with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate (<e>TPA</e>) and the expression of MMPs was examined by reporter gene assay, RT-PCR and Western blotting. VK2 inhibited the basal and TPA-induced expression of MMP-1, -3 and -7 at the transcriptional, mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. VK2 also inhibited the TPA-induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity. The inhibitors against NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinase) including ERK and JNK pathways suppressed TPA-induced luciferase activity of MMP-1, -3 and -7 promoters. These data suggest that VK2 inhibits MMP expression by suppressing NF-kappaB and MAP kinase activity and might be potentially useful in the treatment of HCC.",M1
19633291,"Phosphorylation of histone H3 by protein kinase C signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of the developmentally important TBX2 gene.The mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the TBX2 gene, a key regulator of development, is poorly understood and thus limits an understanding of its function(s). Here we demonstrate that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) induces TBX2 expression in normal human fibroblasts in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and MAPK-independent manner. Our data further reveal that TPA activates transcription of TBX2 through activating MSK1, which leads to an increase in phosphorylated histone H3 and the recruitment of Sp1 to the TBX2 gene. In addition, TPA was shown to activate MSK1 in a PKC-dependent and MAPK-independent manner. This study is the first to provide evidence that phosphorylation of histone H3 leads to the transcriptional activation of the TBX2 gene and to link MSK1 to PKC.",M1

Our study has allowed to ascertain the role of the 6'-sulfonate group and the need of a free hydroxyl group on the glycerol moiety in inhibiting the EBV activation promoted by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>).",M1
19626033,"RIP4 regulates epidermal differentiation and cutaneous inflammation.The receptor-interacting protein (RIP) family kinase RIP4 interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and is implicated in PKC-dependent signaling pathways. RIP4(-/-) mice die at birth with epidermal differentiation defects, causing fusions of all external orifices and loss of the esophageal lumen. To further understand RIP4 function in the skin, we generated transgenic mice with epidermal-specific expression of RIP4 using the human keratin-14 promoter (K14-RIP4). The K14-RIP4 transgene rescued the epidermal phenotype of RIP4(-/-) mice, showing that RIP4 acts autonomously in the epidermis to regulate differentiation. Although RIP4(-/-) mice share many phenotypic similarities with inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK)alpha(-/-) mice and stratifin repeated epilation (Sfn(Er/Er)) mice, the K14-RIP4 transgene failed to promote epidermal differentiation in these mutant backgrounds. Unexpectedly, topical treatment of K14-RIP4 mice with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) induced dramatic, neutrophilic inflammation, an effect that was independent of tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor (TNFR1/p55) function. Despite their enhanced sensitivity to TPA, K14-RIP4 mice did not have an altered frequency of tumor formation in TPA-promoted skin cancer initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). These data suggest that RIP4 functions in the epidermis through PKC-specific signaling pathways to regulate differentiation and inflammation.",M1

19609061,"Analysis of the mechanism for the development of allergic skin inflammation and the application for its treatment:establishment of a modified allergic dermatitis model in mouse ear lobes by application of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate: putative involvement of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and roles of histamine.We established a novel allergic dermatitis model in mouse ear lobes in which antigen-nonspecific inflammation was induced by painting 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) between sensitization and challenge with picryl chloride (PiCl). This model has an advantage for analyzing atopic dermatitis-like inflammation within a short period. Analysis of the time course changes in the PiCl-induced swelling showed that the allergic inflammation was shifted from a delayed-type response to a biphasic response consisting of a weak immediate-phase response and a late-phase response by painting with TPA. The application of TPA increased the PiCl-induced infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells at the inflammatory site and shifted the cytokine milieu from Th1 to Th2. The expression of the Th2-inducing cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) mRNA was also increased by TPA. These findings suggested that the induction of antigen-nonspecific inflammation by TPA before the antigen challenge enhanced the Th2 response and modified the PiCl-induced delayed type-hypersensitivity. Using this model, we clarified that histamine plays significant roles in the early-phase swelling via H(1) receptors and the late-phase swelling via H(3)/H(4) receptors. Thus, we suggested the usefulness of the combined treatment with an H(1) antagonist and an H(4) antagonist for the suppression of atopic dermatitis.",M1

To investigate PGE(2)'s roles, the contributions of one of its receptors, EP2, were studied using the mouse skin initiation/promotion model. Initial studies indicated that protein kinase A (PKA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and several effectors-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), H-Ras, Src, protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-were activated in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-promoted papillomas and that PKA and EGFR inhibition (H89 and AG1478, respectively) decreased papilloma formation. EP2's contributions to the activation of these pathways and papilloma development were determined by inhibiting endogenous TPA-induced PGE(2) production with indomethacin (Indo) and concomitantly treating with the EP2 agonist, CAY10399 (CAY). CAY treatment restored papilloma formation in TPA/Indo-treated mice and increased cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and PKA activation as measured by p-CREB formation. CAY treatment also increased EGFR and Src activation and their inhibition by AG1478 and PP2 indicated that Src was upstream of EGFR. CAY also increased H-Ras, ERK1/2 and AKT activation, and AG1478 decreased their activation indicating EGFR being upstream. Supporting EP2's contribution, EP2-/- mice exhibited 65% fewer papillomas and reduced Src, EGFR, H-Ras, AKT and ERK1/2 activation. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of EGFR has been reported to involve Src's activation via a GPCR-beta-arrestin-Src complex. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of beta-arrestin1 or p-Src indicated the presence of an EP2-beta-arrestin1-p-Src complex in papillomas. The data indicated that EP2 contributed to tumor formation via activation of PKA and EGFR and that EP2 formed a complex with beta-arrestin1 and Src that contributed to signaling and/or EP2 desensitization.",M1
19586612,"Down-regulating protein kinase C alpha: functional cooperation between the proteasome and the endocytic system.Ubiquitination, proteasome, caveolae and endosomes have been implicated in controlling protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) down-regulation. However, the molecular mechanism remained obscure. Here we show that endosomes and proteasome cooperate in phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced down-regulation of PKC alpha. We show that following TPA treatment and translocation to the plasma membrane, PKC alpha undergoes multimonoubiquitination prior to its degradation by the proteasome. However, to reach the proteasome, PKC alpha must travel through the endocytic system from early to late endosomes. This route requires functional endosomes, whereby endosomal alkalinization, or ablation, abrogates completely PKC alpha degradation maintaining the enzyme at the plasma membrane. This route also depends on synaptotagmin (Syt) II and the Rab7 GTPase, whereby Syt II knock-down or expression of the GDP-locked Rab7 inactive mutant prevents PKC alpha degradation. We further show that proteasome plays a dual role, where an active proteasome is required for deubiquitination of PKC alpha, a step crucial to prevent PKC alpha targeting to the endocytic recycling compartment. Finally, we show that the association with rafts-localized cell surface proteins that internalize in a clathrin-independent fashion is necessary to allow the trafficking of PKC alpha from the plasma membrane to the proteasome, its ultimate degradation station.",M1
19577446,"Topical anti-inflammatory effect of tirucallol, a triterpene isolated from Euphorbia lactea latex.Latex from Euphorbia lactea (Euphorbiaceae), a native Dominican medicinal plant, is claimed to be useful in the treatment of inflammation. Topical application of tirucallol, a tetracyclic triterpene isolated from Euphorbia lacteal latex, suppressed ear edema in the mouse model in a dose-dependent manner, as well as affecting the influx of polymorphonuclear cells in response to topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) in the mouse ear. In addition, the effect of tirucallol, on some macrophage functions was analyzed in vitro. Non-toxic concentrations of tirucallol potently inhibited nitrite production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression although tirucallol slightly affected to prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) generation. The results of the study revealed that tirucallol (0.3%), present in Euphorbia lactea latex, exerts a topical anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, via a mechanism of action related to the neutrophil migration. On the other hand, it can be deduced that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of this triterpene is related to the control of the production of NO and its effect on the expression of iNOS.",M1
19541314,"The -1562C/T MMP-9 promoter polymorphism does not predict MMP-9 expression levels or invasive capacity in saphenous vein smooth muscle cells cultured from different patients.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) invasion and proliferation. The T allele of the -1562C/T MMP-9 promoter polymorphism reportedly confers increased MMP-9 promoter activity, plasma MMP-9 levels and susceptibility to vascular pathologies. The aim of this study was to determine whether the MMP-9 -1562C/T polymorphism directly influences endogenous MMP-9 expression levels in saphenous vein (SV) SMC cultured from patients with different genotypes. Genotyping of 408 patients revealed -1562C/T genotype frequencies of 73.3% CC, 25.0% CT and 1.7% TT. Using a standardized, controlled protocol we investigated the effects of phorbol ester (<e>TPA</e>) and a physiological stimulus (PDGF+IL-1) on MMP-9 expression in cultured SV-SMC from 15 CC, 15 CT and 3 TT patients, and on PDGF+IL-1-induced SV-SMC invasion (Boyden chamber with Matrigel barrier). A strong correlation between MMP-9 mRNA levels (real-time RT-PCR) and MMP-9 protein secretion (gelatin zymography) was observed. However, no significant differences were observed in MMP-9 expression levels, or in SV-SMC invasion, between cells with different -1562C/T genotypes. Moreover, MMP-9 promoter activity of the C and T variants was similar. Our data challenge the functional nature of the -1562C/T polymorphism and its capacity to modulate MMP-9 expression levels and SV-SMC invasion, and hence susceptibility to vascular pathologies in vivo.",M1

Since it has been suggested that CLA anti-carcinogenic effect stems from its anti-inflammatory properties, this study investigated whether CLA can prevent cell proliferation induced by TPA in human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 contemporary to inhibition of inflammation. Results obtained showed that CLA prevents increased cell proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory molecules determined by TPA, being this effect due to modulation of PPARs and NFkB activity. The involvement of PPARalpha in CLA effect was demonstrated by adding to the cells an antagonist of PPARalpha.",M1
19526458,"Cellular dichotomy between anchorage-independent growth responses to bFGF and <e>TPA</e> reflects molecular switch in commitment to carcinogenesis.We have investigated gene expression patterns underlying reversible and irreversible anchorage-independent growth (AIG) phenotypes to identify more sensitive markers of cell transformation for studies directed at interrogating carcinogenesis responses. In JB6 mouse epidermal cells, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induces an unusually efficient and reversible AIG response, relative to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced AIG which is irreversible. The reversible and irreversible AIG phenotypes are characterized by largely nonoverlapping global gene expression profiles. However, a subset of differentially expressed genes were identified as common to reversible and irreversible AIG phenotypes, including genes regulated in a reciprocal fashion. Hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) and D-site albumin promoter-binding protein (DBP) were increased in both bFGF and TPA soft agar colonies and selected for functional validation. Ectopic expression of human HLF and DBP in JB6 cells resulted in a marked increase in TPA- and bFGF-regulated AIG responses. HLF and DBP expression were increased in soft agar colonies arising from JB6 cells exposed to gamma radiation and in a human basal cell carcinoma tumor tissue, relative to paired nontumor tissue. Subsequent biological network analysis suggests that many of the differentially expressed genes that are common to bFGF- and TPA-dependent AIG are regulated by c-Myc, SP-1, and HNF-4 transcription factors. Collectively, we have identified a potential molecular switch that mediates the transition from reversible to irreversible AIG.",M1
19521986,"Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid and diamino acid derivatives of protoporphyrin IX reduces papillomas in mice without eliminating transformation into squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat malignant and nonmalignant diseases. It is also used for cosmetological skin treatment. PDT is generally considered to have a low risk of carcinogenicity. However, instances of nonmalignant human tumors turning malignant have been linked to PDT. In this study, we used 5-aminolevulinic (ALA) acid and 3 water soluble photosensitizers-PP(Arg)(2), PP(Ser)(2)Arg(2), PP(Ala)(2)Arg(2), all diamino acid derivatives of protoporphyrin IX-to treat benign papillomas in FVB/N mice induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). Of these drugs, ALA and PP(Arg)(2) were found the most efficient. PDT reduced the number of papillomas, but with increasing effectiveness of the drugs, the risk of malignant transformation of the papillomas into squamous cell carcinomas increased. The underlying mechanisms are not clear and further investigations are needed.",M1
19519169,"Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling interferes with phorbol ester-induced growth arrest of keratinocytes in a TNFR1-independent manner.A skin-specific block in NF-kappaB signaling leads to hyperproliferation of the keratinocytes, inflammation, and spontaneous development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we show that an inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in keratinocytes, via the expression of the super-repressor/ degradation-resistant form of the IkappaBalpha protein (IkappaBalphaDN), interferes with the growth arrest induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). The IkappaBalphaDN cells are able to overcome the TPA-induced cell cycle block. Although SCC development as well as hyperproliferation due to IkappaBalphaDN expression in keratinocytes is known to require TNFR1 signaling, the effect of IkappaBalphaDN on phorbol ester signaling is downstream/independent of TNFR1. These data thus identify an interaction between IkappaBalphaDN and the tumor promoter TPA in the growth regulation of keratinocytes. The proposed mechanism is also likely to be significant in the process of cancer development due to NF-kappaB inhibition.",M1
19481937,"Cancer preventive agents 9. Betulinic acid derivatives as potent cancer chemopreventive agents.C-3 esterifications of betulinic acid (BA, 1) and its A-ring homolog, ceanothic acid (CA, 2), were carried out to provide sixteen terpenoids, 4-19, including nine new compounds (4-12). All synthesized compounds were evaluated in an in vitro antitumor-promoting assay using the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) in Raji cells. Among them, compounds 4-6, 11-14, 16, and 17 displayed remarkable inhibitory effects of EBV-EA activation. BA analog 6, which contains a prenyl-like group, showed the most potent inhibitory effect (100%, 76%, 37%, and 11% inhibition of EBA activation at 1000, 500, 100, and 10mol ratio/TPA, respectively, with IC(50) value of 285mol ratio/32pmol TPA).

19472186,"Effects of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC (c/nPKC) activation on the production of adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.PPARgamma plays a key role in adipocyte specific gene expression. In this study, we assessed the effects of phorbol ester (<e>TPA</e>)-sensitive PKC (c/nPKC) activation on the expression of adipocyte specific genes and inflammation related genes. Treatment with both TPA and TNFalpha decreased mRNA levels of PPARgamma, aP2, LPL and adiponectin. TNFalpha, but not TPA, increased IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA levels, Next, we investigated the effects of ligands which activate c/nPKC. Insulin and angiotensin II (AII), but not high glucose, reduced PPARgamma, aP2 and adiponectin mRNA levels. AII-induced suppression of these genes was restored in the presence of Go6976, a specific c/nPKC inhibitor, and candesartan, an AII receptor blocker. The effect of reduced insulin was prevented by Go6976 and LY294002, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Our results indicate that activation of c/nPKC could debilitate and/or might deteriorate insulin sensitivity in vivo, through the reduction of PPARgamma and adiponectin expression in adipocyte.",M1
19470390,"Chemopreventive effect of farnesol on DMBA/<e>TPA</e>-induced skin tumorigenesis: involvement of inflammation, Ras-ERK pathway and apoptosis.AIMS: Naturally-derived farnesol has been reported for its chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic efficacy in various cancers. However, the mechanism of action of farnesol is still to be elucidated. The present study demonstrates the chemopreventive potential of farnesol on 9,10-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted skin tumorigenesis in Swiss albino mice. MAIN METHODS: Farnesol at three different doses 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight was topically applied to the mouse skin, 30 min prior to TPA (2 microg/200 microl acetone) to evaluate edema, hyperplasia, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), oxidative stress response and hyperproliferation, and expression of Ras, Raf, p-ERK1/2, Bax and Bcl-2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors. KEY FINDINGS: Farnesol at both the low doses significantly reduced the TPA-induced skin edema, hyperplasia, expression of COX-2 and oxidative stress response. Interestingly, higher dose of farnesol did not show any significant response. Pretreatment of farnesol significantly decreased TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in dose-dependent manner. During promotion phase, farnesol with higher dose significantly regressed tumor incidence and tumor burden with an extension of latency period of 4-8 weeks. More importantly, low doses of farnesol significantly inhibited Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in mouse skin tumors whereas higher dose of farnesol induced the pathway. Moreover, farnesol at all doses altered Bax/Bcl-2 ratio which leads to induction of apoptosis as confirmed by DNA fragmentation. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings revealed that oxidative stress, inflammation, Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway and apoptosis collectively played a crucial role in the chemopreventive activity of farnesol to inhibit the murine skin tumorigenesis.",M1
19458037,"Phospholipase Cepsilon promotes intestinal tumorigenesis of Apc(Min/+) mice through augmentation of inflammation and angiogenesis.Apc(Min/+) mice, carrying an inactivated allele of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, are widely used as an animal model for human colorectal tumorigenesis, where tumor environment, such as inflammation, is known to play a critical role in tumor progression. We previously demonstrated that phospholipase C (PLC)epsilon, an effector of Ras and Rap small GTPases, plays a crucial role in two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis using 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbor-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) as a promoter through augmentation of TPA-induced inflammation. Here, we show that Apc(Min/+) mice lacking PLCepsilon (PLCepsilon(-/-)) exhibit marked resistance to spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis compared with those with the PLCepsilon(+/+) background. Time course of the development of tumors, which are histopathologically classified into low- and high-grade adenomas with increasing dysplasia and size, and adenocarcinomas indicates that not only the low-grade adenoma formation but also the progression to high-grade adenoma are suppressed in PLCepsilon(-/-);Apc(Min/+) mice. Low-grade adenomas of PLCepsilon(-/-);Apc(Min/+) mice exhibit accelerated apoptosis and reduced cellular proliferation. They also show marked attenuation of tumor angiogenesis and reduction in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. In contrast, high-grade adenomas of PLCepsilon(-/-);Apc(Min/+) mice exhibit marked attenuation of tumor-associated inflammation without significant differences in apoptosis and proliferation. These results suggest that PLCepsilon plays crucial roles in intestinal tumorigenesis through two distinct mechanisms, augmentation of angiogenesis and inflammation, depending on the tumor stage.",M1
19447859,"Pterostilbene inhibited tumor invasion via suppressing multiple signal transduction pathways in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Pterostilbene, a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol, is known to have diverse pharmacologic activities including anticancer, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, apoptosis, anti-proliferation and analgesic potential. However, the effects of pterostilbene in preventing invasion of cancer cells have not been studied. Here, we report our finding that pterostilbene significantly suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced invasion, migration and metastasis of human hepatoma cells (HepG(2) cells). Increase in the enzyme activity, protein and messenger RNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 were observed in TPA-treated HepG(2) cells, and these were blocked by pterostilbene. In addition, pterostilbene can inhibit TPA-induced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor. Transient transfection experiments also showed that pterostilbene strongly inhibited TPA-stimulated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent transcriptional activity in HepG(2) cells. Moreover, pterostilbene can suppress TPA-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and protein kinase C that are upstream of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Significant therapeutic effects were further demonstrated in vivo by treating nude mice with pterostilbene (50 and 250 mg/kg intraperitoneally) after inoculation with HepG(2) cells into the tail vein. Presented data reveal that pterostilbene is a novel, effective, anti-metastatic agent that functions by downregulating MMP-9 gene expression.",M1
19432991,"Identification of the B-Raf/Mek/Erk MAP kinase pathway as a target for all-trans retinoic acid during skin cancer promotion.BACKGROUND: Retinoids have been studied extensively for their potential as therapeutic and chemopreventive agents for a variety of cancers, including nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Despite their use for many years, the mechanism of action of retinoids in the prevention of NMSC is still unclear. In this study we have attempted to understand the chemopreventive mechanism of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a primary biologically active retinoid, in order to more efficiently utilize retinoids in the clinic. RESULTS: We have used the 2-stage dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) mouse skin carcinogenesis model to investigate the chemopreventive effects of ATRA. We have compared the gene expression profiles of control skin to skin subjected to the 2-stage protocol, with or without ATRA, using Affymetrix 430 2.0 DNA microarrays. Approximately 49% of the genes showing altered expression with TPA treatment are conversely affected when ATRA is co-administered. The activity of these genes, which we refer to as 'counter-regulated', may contribute to chemoprevention by ATRA. The counter-regulated genes have been clustered into functional categories and bioinformatic analysis has identified the B-Raf/Mek/Erk branch of the MAP kinase pathway as one containing several genes whose upregulation by TPA is blocked by ATRA. We also show that ATRA blocks signaling through this pathway, as revealed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Finally, we found that blocking the B-Raf/Mek/Erk pathway with a pharmacological inhibitor, Sorafenib (BAY43-9006), induces squamous differentiation of existing skin SCCs formed in the 2-stage model. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ATRA targets the B-Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway in the 2-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model and this activity coincides with its chemopreventive action. This demonstrates the potential for targeting the B-Raf/Mek/Erk pathway for chemoprevention and therapy of skin SCC in humans. In addition our DNA microarray results provide the first expression signature for the chemopreventive effect of ATRA in a mouse skin cancer model. This is a potential source for novel targets for ATRA and other chemopreventive and therapeutic agents that can eventually be tested in the clinic.",M1
19429354,"Anti-inflammatory activity of Chrysanthemum indicum extract in acute and chronic cutaneous inflammation.AIM OF THE STUDY: Although Chrysanthemum indicum Linné (Compositae) has long been used in traditional Korean, Chinese, Japanese medicine to treat various immune-related diseases the underlying mechanism(s) by which these effects are induced remains to be defined in vivo model system. We investigated the effects of 70% ethanolic extract from Chrysanthemum indicum Linné (CIE) on skin inflammation in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta), activation of myeloperoxidase, and histological assessment were examined in acute and chronic skin inflammation using 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced mouse ear edema. RESULTS: CIE inhibited topical edema in the mouse ear, following administration at 200mg/kg (i.p.), leading to substantial reductions in skin thickness and tissue weight, inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophil-mediated myeloperoxidase activity, and various histopathological indicators. Furthermore, CIE was effective at reducing inflammatory damage induced by chronic TPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CIE is an effective anti-inflammatory agent in murine phorbol ester-induced dermatitis, and suggest that the extract may have therapeutic potential in a variety of immune-related cutaneous diseases.",M1
19420332,"Increased expression of gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in pterygia and pterygium fibroblasts with disease progression and activation of protein kinase C.PURPOSE: To study the expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 mRNA and activities in various stages of surgically excised pterygium specimens and cultured pterygium fibroblasts and to study the effects of activation of protein kinase C (PKC) on the expression of these MMPs in pterygium fibroblasts. METHODS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression and activities in 15 pterygium tissues and cultured pterygium fibroblasts were measured by RT-PCR and zymography. Five normal conjunctiva specimens and fibroblasts were tested as the controls. Changes of expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of fibroblasts after the simulation of a standard PKC activator, 2-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), were studied. RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in pterygium tissues and fibroblasts was greater than those of normal tissues and fibroblasts and was closely relevant to the progression of pterygium. In early-stage pterygium tissues and cultured fibroblasts, MMP-9 was not expressed, activated MMP-2 could not be detected, and only a small amount of latent MMP-2 was present. In advanced-stage pterygium (pterygium head passed the papillary region), MMP-9 was expressed; activated MMP-2 and a large amount of latent MMP-2 could be detected in pterygium tissues and fibroblasts. TPA stimulated the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by pterygium fibroblasts isolated from early-stage specimens in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression by pterygium fibroblasts is significantly increased after the progression of pterygium. Activation of the PKC signaling pathway, aside from other previously reported signaling pathways, may play a role in the development and progression of pterygium.",M1
19414503,"Linoleic acid metabolite suppresses skin inflammation and tumor promotion in mice: possible roles of programmed cell death 4 induction.(+/-)-13-Hydroxy-10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid (13-HOA) is one of the lipoxygenase metabolites of linoleic acid (LA) from corn germ. Recently, we reported that this metabolite suppressed the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory genes in murine macrophages by disrupting mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt pathways. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of 13-HOA on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced inflammation in ears and skin, as well as tumor promotion in female ICR mice. Pretreatment with 13-HOA (1600 nmol) inhibited ear edema formation by 95% (P &lt; 0.05) in an inflammation test and reduced tumor incidence and the number of tumors per mouse by 40 and 64% (P &lt; 0.05 each), respectively, in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. Histological examinations revealed that it decreased epidermal thickness, the number of infiltrated leukocytes and cell proliferation index. Furthermore, 13-HOA (8-40 muM) suppressed TPA-induced anchorage-independent growth of JB6 mouse epidermal cells by 70-100%, whereas LA was virtually inactive. 13-HOA (40 muM) inhibited TPA-induced activator protein-1 transactivation but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 activation. Interestingly, 13-HOA (40 muM and 1600 nmol in JB6 cells and mouse skin, respectively) induced expression of programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a novel tumor suppressor protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a food factor that is able to induce Pdcd4 expression. Collectively, our results indicate that 13-HOA may be a novel anti-inflammatory and antitumor chemopreventive agent with a unique mode of action.",M1
19414379,"Declined asparagine synthetase mRNA expression and enhanced sensitivity to asparaginase in HL-60 cells committed to monocytic differentiation.During 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells toward maturing monocytes/macrophages, asparagine synthetase (ASNS) mRNA expression declined time and dose-dependently. The effect of TPA was inhibited by inhibitors for PKC and MEK 1/2, but not by those for JNK and p38 MAPK. Combination treatment with TPA and asparaginase synergistically enhanced the growth retardation accompanied by apoptotic cell death characterized by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These data suggest the possible involvement of MEK1/2 MAPK in the inhibitory effect of TPA on ASNS mRNA expression and that the induction of the down-regulation of ASNS (via MEK1/2 activation) may be a new strategy for the treatment of leukemia blast cells.",M1
19414336,"Noninvasive bioluminescent and microPET imaging for the regulation of NF-kappaB in human hepatoma-bearing mice.The activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a nuclear transcription factor, influences both critical tumor promotion and host-tumor interactions. Preventing NF-kappaB activation may thus inhibit the development of cancer. Therefore, development of easy and rapid methods to evaluate the regulation of NF-kappaB is needed for drug discovery. The aim of this study was to visualize the regulation of NF-kappaB by real-time, noninvasive bioluminescence and microPET imaging in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A highly responsive HepG2/NF-kappaB/luc clone L for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced tumor promotion inhibited by methotrexate (MTX) was selected by high-throughput bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in vitro. BLI and microPET using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging were performed in HepG2/NF-kappaB/Luc/L hepatoma-bearing SCID mice. RESULTS: The luciferase expression by BLI assay reflected that the TPA-induced NF-kappaB activity was suppressed by MTX after 16 h treatment. A positive correlation between in vitro and in vivo MTX-suppressed TPA-induced NF-kappaB activity was indicated. MicroPET imaging could not demonstrate any decrease in FDG uptake during the early stage at 24 h after TPA and MTX treatment. CONCLUSION: BLI directly revealed that MTX inhibited cellular transformation by suppressing NF-kappaB activity. Molecular imaging would accelerate the validation of the gene regulation of tumor cells in preclinical cellular and mouse models.",M1
19409374,"Reduced skin inflammatory response in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase.The skin is the largest organ in the body and one of its main functions is to protect the body from environmental and endogenous noxious conditions, such as injury, infection and inflammation. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated as a key component in the inflammatory response. In the present study, we assessed the role of iNOS in the skin inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). Mice deficient in iNOS had reduced edema and cellular infiltration in the skin following topical TPA application. Moreover, the genetic blockage of iNOS signaling inhibited the TPA-induced ERK and p38 activation resulting in reduced COX-2 upregulation. Finally, immunohistochemical studies revealed that iNOS knockout mice exhibited marked inhibition of AP-1, CREB and NF-kappaB transcriptional factors activation. Together, these results indicate that TPA induces the activation of several iNOS-dependent intracellular signaling pathways that have a key role in the control of inflammatory response in the skin. Therefore, selective iNOS inhibitors may be potentially relevant tools for cutaneous skin disease drug development.",M1
19406475,"The mechanism of HTLV-1 LTR activation by <e>TPA</e> varies in different human T-cell lines: role of specific PKC isoforms.We demonstrate here that TPA activates HTLV-1 LTR expression in Jurkat and H9 T-cell lines, by strictly different mechanisms. In Jurkat cells this activation is exerted by a PKCalpha- and PKCvarepsilon-antagonized mechanism which operates through an Sp1 binding site residing within the Est responsive region 1 of the LTR. On the other hand, in H9 cells TPA activates the LTR by two consecutive mechanisms; the first depends on PKCeta activity and is exerted through the 21 bp repeats of the LTR, whereas the second is analogous to that observed in Jurkat cells, except that it is antagonized by PKCdelta.",M1
19383924,"Selective role for Mek1 but not Mek2 in the induction of epidermal neoplasia.The Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates fundamental processes in normal and malignant cells, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. Mutations in this pathway have been associated with carcinogenesis and developmental disorders, making Mek1 and Mek2 prime therapeutic targets. In this study, we examined the requirement for Mek1 and Mek2 in skin neoplasia using the two-step 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (DMBA/<e>TPA</e>) skin carcinogenesis model. Mice lacking epidermal Mek1 protein develop fewer papillomas than both wild-type and Mek2-null mice following DMBA/TPA treatment. Mek1 knockout mice had smaller papillomas, delayed tumor onset, and half the tumor burden of wild-type mice. Loss of one Mek1 allele, however, did not affect tumor development, indicating that one Mek1 allele is sufficient for normal papilloma formation. No difference in TPA-induced hyperproliferation, inflammation, or Erk activation was observed between wild-type, conditional Mek1 knockout, and Mek2-null mice, indicating that Mek1 findings were not due to a general failure of these processes. These data show that Mek1 is important for skin tumor development and that Mek2 cannot compensate for the loss of Mek1 function in this setting.",M1
19379723,"ASB16165, a phosphodiesterase 7A inhibitor, reduces cutaneous TNF-alpha level and ameliorates skin edema in phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin inflammation model in mice.Possible role of phosphodiesterase 7A (PDE7A) in skin inflammation was examined using ASB16165, a specific inhibitor for PDE7A. Epicutaneous application of phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) to mouse ear resulted in induction of skin edema, and topical treatment with ASB16165 inhibited the induction of skin edema in a dose-dependent manner. The TPA challenge also increased the level of TNF-alpha at the application site, and the ASB16165 treatment reduced the TNF-alpha level in the skin. In addition, ASB16165 suppressed the production of TNF-alpha by human keratinocytes stimulated in vitro with TPA and calcium ionophore. Forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, as well as dibutyryl cAMP also showed inhibitory effect on the TNF-alpha production in the cells, suggesting involvement of cAMP in TNF-alpha generation. These results demonstrate that PDE7A might regulate TNF-alpha production in keratinocytes in a cAMP-dependent fashion. As immunostaining analysis revealed that PDE7A is expressed in the epidermis and TNF-alpha is known to contribute to the TPA-induced edema, it is possible that the inhibitory effect of ASB16165 on skin edema in mouse TPA-induced dermatitis model is mediated by suppression of TNF-alpha production. This is the first report suggesting the association of PDE7A with the function of keratinocytes. ASB16165 will be useful as an agent for skin inflammation in which TNF-alpha plays a pathogenic role (e.g. psoriasis).",M1
19379509,"Activation of P2X(7)-mediated apoptosis Inhibits DMBA/<e>TPA</e>-induced formation of skin papillomas and cancer in mice.BACKGROUND: The study tested the hypothesis that apoptosis can prevent and control growth of neoplastic cells. Previous studies in-vitro have shown that the pro-apoptotic P2X(7) receptor regulates growth of epithelial cells. The specific objective of the present study was to understand to what degree the P2X(7) system controls development and growth of skin cancer in vivo, and what cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in the P2X(7) action. METHODS: Skin neoplasias in mice (papillomas, followed by squamous spindle-cell carcinomas) were induced by local application of DMBA/TPA. Experiments in-vitro utilized cultured epidermal keratinocytes generated from wild-type or from P2X(7)-null mice. Assays involved protein immunostaining and Western blots; mRNA real-time qPCR; and apoptosis (evaluated in situ by TUNEL and quantified in cultured keratinocytes as solubilized DNA or by ELISA). Changes in cytosolic calcium or in ethidium bromide influx (P2X(7) pore formation) were determined by confocal laser microscopy. RESULTS: (a) Co-application on the skin of the P2X7 specific agonist BzATP inhibited formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papillomas and carcinomas. At the completion of study (week 28) the proportion of living animals with cancers in the DMBA/TPA group was 100% compared to 43% in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. (b) In the normal skin BzATP affected mainly P2X(7)-receptor - expressing proliferating keratinocytes, where it augmented apoptosis without evoking inflammatory changes. (c) In BzATP-treated mice the degree of apoptosis was lesser in cancer than in normal or papilloma keratinocytes. (d) Levels of P2X(7) receptor, protein and mRNA were 4-5 fold lower in cancer tissues than in normal mouse tissues. (e) In cultured mouse keratinocytes BzATP induced apoptosis, formation of pores in the plasma membrane, and facilitated prolonged calcium influx. (f) The BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore-formation and augmented calcium influx had similar dose-dependence for BzATP. (g) Pore formation and the augmented calcium influx were depended on the expression of the P2X(7) receptor, while the BzATP-induced apoptosis depended on calcium influx. (h) The BzATP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by co-treatment with inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not of caspase-8. CONCLUSION: (a) P2X(7)-dependent apoptosis is an important mechanism that controls the development and progression of epidermal neoplasia in the mouse. (b) The P2X(7)-dependent apoptosis is mediated by calcium influx via P2X(7) pores, and involves the caspase-9 (mitochondrial) pathway. (c) The diminished pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP in mouse cancer keratinocytes is possibly the result of low expression of the P2X(7) receptor. (d) Activation of P2X(7)-dependent apoptosis, e.g. with BzATP could be a novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modality for papillomas and epithelial cancers in vivo.",M1
19366707,"Nucleophosmin blocks mitochondrial localization of p53 and apoptosis.Activation of p53 is an important mechanism in apoptosis. However, whether the presence of p53 in mitochondria plays an important role in p53-mediated apoptosis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of NPM (nucleophosmin) significantly suppresses 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-mediated apoptosis, in part, by blocking the mitochondrial localization of p53. Within 1 h following TPA treatment of skin epithelial (JB6) cells, p53 accumulated in mitochondria. Expression of NPM enhances p53 levels in the nucleus but reduces p53 levels in mitochondria, as detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. The suppressive effect of NPM on p53 mitochondrial localization is also observed in TPA-treated primary epithelial cells and in JB6 cells treated with doxorubicin. NPM enhances the expression of p53 target gene p21 and bax. However, the increase in Bax level in the absence of p53 in mitochondria did not lead to an increase in TPA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the presence of p53 in mitochondria is important. Suppression of NPM by NPM small interfering RNA leads to an increase of p53 levels in mitochondria and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of NPM in tumor cells with a high constitutive level of NPM results in p53 translocation to mitochondria and enhances TPA-mediated apoptosis. The results demonstrate the effect of NPM on p53 localization in mitochondria and apoptosis. Together, the data indicate that the presence of p53 in mitochondria plays an important role in stress-induced apoptosis and suggest that NPM may protect cells from apoptosis by reducing the mitochondrial level of p53.",M1
19335688,"Increased expression of CD208 (DC-LAMP) in epidermal keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions.Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of innate immunity involving dendritic cells (DC) and keratinocytes in psoriasis. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of DC markers such as CD1a, CD83, CD207 (Langerin), CD208 (DC-LAMP) and CD209 (DC-SIGN) in psoriatic skin and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-stimulated keratinocytes in vitro. CD208 was strongly expressed in basal and suprabasal layer keratinocytes in addition to DC in the perivascular lesions of the psoriatic dermis. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of CD208 in the perinuclear lesions of IFN-gamma-/TPA-stimulated keratinocytes was observed in vitro. Because a defect of the granular layer in psoriatic lesions has been recognized, increased expression of lysosome-related CD208 in the basal and suprabasal keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions might represent aberrant epidermal differentiation. Additionally, these CD208-positive keratinocytes possessing putative antigen-processing activity might play a key role as antigen-presenting cells in psoriatic skin.",M1
19308091,"BMP-6 inhibits microRNA-21 expression in breast cancer through repressing deltaEF1 and AP-1.MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small noncoding RNA molecules, play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation process. The microRNA-21 gene (miR-21) has been reported to be highly expressed in various solid tumors, including breast cancer. Bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) has been identified as an inhibitor of breast cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through rescuing E-cadherin expression. We initiated experiments to identify the relationships between miR-21 and BMP-6 in breast cancer progression. Real-time PCR analysis showed that miR-21 expression was very high in MDA-MB-231 cells that expressed little BMP-6. A reverse correlation between BMP-6 and miR-21 was also determined in breast cancer tissue samples. Moreover, BMP-6 inhibited miR-21 transcription in MDA-MB-231 cells. In order to investigate how BMP-6 inhibited the miR-21 promoter (miPPR-21), we constructed a series of miPPR-21 reporters. Luciferase assay results indicated that BMP-6 inhibited miPPR-21 activity through the E2-box and AP-1-binding sites. We also demonstrated that both deltaEF1 and <e>TPA</e> induced miR-21 expression. Using site-directed mutation and CHIP assay, we found that deltaEF1 induced miPPR-21 activity by binding to the E2-box on miPPR-21. Moreover, TPA triggered miPPR-21 activity through the AP-1 binding sites. BMP-6 treatment significantly reduced the binding of these factors to miPPR-21 by decreasing the expression of deltaEF1 and c-Fos/c-Jun. We also demonstrated that BMP-6-induced downregulation of miR-21 modified the activity of PDCD4 3'UTR and inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion. deltaEF1 overexpression and TPA induction blocked this inhibitory effect of BMP-6. In conclusion, BMP-6-induced inhibition of miR-21 suggests that BMP-6 may function as an anti-metastasis factor by a mechanism involving transcriptional repression of miR-21 in breast cancer.",M1
19258009,"Interplay between PKC and the MAP kinase pathway in Connexin43 phosphorylation and inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication.Gap junction channels are made of a family proteins called connexins. The best-studied type of connexin, Connexin43 (Cx43), is phosphorylated at several sites in its C-terminus. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester <e>TPA</e> strongly inhibits Cx43 gap junction channels. In this study we have investigated mechanisms involved in TPA-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of gap junction channels. The data show that TPA-induced inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is dependent on both PKC and the MAP kinase pathway. The data suggest that PKC-induced activation of MAP kinase partly involves Src-independent trans-activation of the EGF receptor, and that TPA-induced shift in SDS-PAGE gel mobility of Cx43 is caused by MAP kinase phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of S368 by PKC does not alter gel migration of Cx43. We also show that TPA, in addition to phosphorylation of S368, also induces phosphorylation of S255 and S262, in a MAP kinase-dependent manner. The data add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the interplay between signaling pathways in regulation of GJIC.",M1
19244111,"IFNgamma promotes papilloma development by up-regulating Th17-associated inflammation.IFNgamma plays a crucial role in immunity against a variety of transplanted tumors and methylcholanthrene-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. However, it is not clear whether and how endogenous IFNgamma influences 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced papilloma development. We found here that IFNgamma expression was markedly up-regulated shortly after DMBA/TPA application to the skin. Surprisingly, neutralizing IFNgamma activity in vivo did not increase but rather decreased tumor development. Furthermore, IFNgamma receptor-deficient mice were also more resistant to papilloma development than their counterparts were. IFNgamma acted mainly in the promotion stage of papilloma development by enhancing TPA-induced leukocyte infiltration and epidermal hyperproliferation. The up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and transforming growth factor beta was largely dependent on host IFNgamma responsiveness. Remarkably, up-regulation of both IL-17 expression in the skin and T helper 17 (Th17) cell number in draining lymph nodes after DMBA/TPA treatment was dependent on IFNgamma signaling. Depletion of IL-17 not only decreased the DMBA/TPA-induced inflammation and keratinocyte proliferation but also delayed papilloma development. These results show that IFNgamma, under certain conditions, may promote tumor development by enhancing a Th17-associated inflammatory reaction.",M1
19238332,"The expression of protein kinase B in gastric cancer cell apoptosis induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-1, 3-acetate.Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a serine-threonine kinase functioning downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) in response to mitogen or growth factor stimulation. In several cell types, it plays an important anti-apoptotic role. <e>TPA</e> is a potent regulator of the growth of many different cell types. Here, we detected that TPA could induce cell apoptosis in the gastric cancer cell line, BGC-823. We also found that TPA inhibited the expression of PKB/Akt in a TPA concentration- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, TPA inhibited the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473, but did not affect the phosphorylation of Thr308. It only attenuated the expression of PKB/Akt and the phosphorylation of Ser473 in the cell nucleus, whereas it did not change the PKB/Akt distribution in BGC-823 cells. These results suggest that PKB/Akt inhibition by TPA may be the important factor in the mechanism of effect of TPA on gastric cell lines.",M1
19189300,"Morphofunctional study of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced differentiation of U937 cells under exposure to a 6 mT static magnetic field.This study deals with the morphofunctional influence of 72 h exposure to a 6 mT static magnetic field (SMF) during differentiation induced by 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA) in human leukaemia U937 cells. The cell morphology of U937 cells was investigated by optic and electron microscopy. Specific antibodies and/or molecules were used to label CD11c, CD14, phosphatidylserine, F-actin and to investigate the distribution and activity of lysosomes, mitochondria and SER. [Ca(2+)](i) was evaluated with a spectrophotometer. The degree of differentiation in SMF-exposed cells was lower than that of non-exposed cells, the difference being exposure time-dependent. SMF-exposed cells showed cell shape and F-actin modification, inhibition of cell attachment, appearance of membrane roughness and large blebs and impaired expression of specific macrophagic markers on the cell surface. The intracellular localization of SER and lysosomes was only partially affected by exposure. A significant localization of mitochondria with an intact membrane potential at the cell periphery in non-exposed, TPA-stimulated cells was observed; conversely, in the presence of SMF, mitochondria were mainly localised near the nucleus. In no case did SMF exposure affect cell viability. The sharp intracellular increase of [Ca(2+)](i) could be one of the causes of the above-described changes.",M1
19181503,"Silibinin prevents <e>TPA</e>-induced MMP-9 expression and VEGF secretion by inactivation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression are pivotal steps in cancer metastasis. Herein, we investigated the effect of silibinin, a major constituent (flavanolignan) of the fruits of Silybum marianum, on 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The expression of MMP-9 and VEGF in response to TPA was increased, whereas TPA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression was decreased by silibinin. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of silibinin on TPA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression, we pretreated cells with various inhibitors, such as UO126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor). Interestingly, TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was significantly inhibited by UO126, but not by SP600125 and SB203580. In addition, we pretreated cells with 100 microM silibinin prior to TPA treatment. TPA-induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation was significantly decreased by silibinin in MCF7 cells. TPA-induced VEGF expression was also suppressed by UO126. On the other hand, we found that adenoviral constitutive active-MEK (Ad-CA-MEK) significantly increased MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Taken together, we suggest that the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression by silibinin is mediated by the suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.",M1
19176525,"Phosphorylation of Activation Transcription Factor-2 at Serine 121 by Protein Kinase C Controls c-Jun-mediated Activation of Transcription.Activation transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) is phosphorylated by various protein kinases, such as JNK/p38/ERK, calmodulin kinase IV, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C (PKC), in response to a variety of stimuli. However, the role of the phosphorylation of ATF-2 by PKC in vivo in the transcriptional control of genes that include the activation protein-1 (AP-1)/cyclic AMP-response element remains to be defined. Using antibodies against the phosphorylated serine residue (Ser(P)) at position 121 of ATF-2, we have demonstrated that PKC phosphorylates ATF-2 at Ser-121 and that phosphorylation of Ser-121 (to yield ATF-2pS121) becomes detectable at the late stage of the response of HeLa cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) and is maintained for more than 2 h. By contrast, phosphorylation of ATF-2 at threonine residues 69 and 71 (Thr-69/71, to yield ATF-2pT69/71) and at Ser-340 and Ser-367 (to yield ATF-2pS340 and ATF-2pS367) is detectable as an immediate early response. Unlike levels of ATF-2pT69/71 and ATF-2pS340, the level of ATF-2pS121 increases in the nuclei of HeLa cells in response to TPA. A serine-to-alanine mutation at position 121 of ATF-2 represses the c-Jun-dependent transcription of AP-1/cyclic AMP-response element reporter genes and also the p300-mediated activation of a Gal4-reporter gene in response to TPA. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Ser-121 plays a key role in the c-Jun-mediated activation of transcription that occurs in response to TPA.",M1
19168148,"Identification of nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in Ets2, and the transcriptional regulation of Ets2 and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha in tetradecanoyl-13-acetate or macrophage-colony stimulating factor stimulated RAW264 cells.PC is made via the CDP-choline pathway, in which CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha (CTalpha), encoded by Pcyt1a, is the rate-limiting enzyme whose mRNA expression is strictly regulated. Previously, we reported that Ets1 enhanced and Net repressed CTalpha transcription by binding at the Ets binding site (-49/-47) in the Pcyt1a promoter. In this study, we asked if an Ets1 analogue, Ets2, also regulates CTalpha transcription and investigated the importance of its nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES). Ets2 is primarily detected in the nucleus. Various mutated Ets2 proteins fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein were constructed to identify the NLS and NES in Ets2. Mutation of Ets2 at amino acids 404-410 results in a protein that is evenly distributed in the cell. Interestingly, an Ets2 protein deleted at the C-terminus (amino acids 1-392 present) was localized to the cytoplasm and site-specific mutation in the region 364-372 of this construct resulted in cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. These results suggest that the NLS in Ets2 is between amino acids 404 and 410, and that the NES is between amino acids 364 and 372. Ets2 enhanced, but the mutant forms of Ets2 had little effects on the transcription of a CTalpha-reporter construct. When RAW264 cells, murine macrophage cell-line, were stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>) or macrophage-colony stimulating factor, the transcription of CTalpha was enhanced accompanied by increased mRNA of Ets2. These results suggest that the induction of Ets2 is important for CTalpha transcription by TPA and macrophage-colony stimulating factor.",M1
19168130,"Signal transduction of constitutively active protein kinase C epsilon.The protein kinase C (PKC) family is the most prominent target of tumor-promoting phorbol esters. For the PKCepsilon isozyme, different intracellular localizations and oncogenic potential in several but not all experimental systems have been reported. To obtain information about PKCepsilon-signaling, we investigated the effects of constitutively active rat PKCepsilon (PKCepsilonA/E, alanine 159 is replaced by glutamic acid) in HeLa cells in a doxycycline-inducible vector. Upon induction of PKCepsilonA/E expression by doxycycline, the major part of PKCepsilonA/E was localized to the Golgi. This led (i) to phosphorylations of PKCepsilon(S729), Elk-1(S383), PDK1(S241) and Rb(S807/S811), (ii) to elevated expression of receptor of activated C kinase 2 (RACK2) after 12 h, and (iii) increased colony formation in soft agar, increased cell migration and invasion, but not to decreased doubling time. Following induction of PKCepsilonA/E-expression by doxycycline for 24 h and additional short-term treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), PKCepsilonA/E translocated to the plasma membrane and increased phosphorylation of MARCKS(S152/156). Treatment with doxycycline/TPA or TPA alone increased phosphorylations of Elk-1(S383), PDK1(S241), Rb(S807/S811), PKCdelta(T505), p38MAPK(T180/Y182), MEK1/2(S217/S221) and ERK2(T185/T187). MARCKS was not phosphorylated after treatment with TPA alone, demonstrating that in this system it is phosphorylated only by PKCepsilon localized to the plasma membrane but not by PKCalpha or delta, the other TPA-responsive PKC isozymes in HeLa cells. These results demonstrate that PKCepsilon can induce distinctly different signaling from the Golgi and from the plasma membrane.",M1
19164581,"The coactivator CRTC1 promotes cell proliferation and transformation via AP-1.Regulation of gene expression in response to mitogenic stimuli is a critical aspect underlying many forms of human cancers. The AP-1 complex mediates the transcriptional response to mitogens, and its deregulation causes developmental defects and tumors. We report that the coactivator CRTC1 cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 is a potent and indispensable modulator of AP-1 function. After exposure of cells to the AP-1 agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>), CRTC1 is recruited to AP-1 target gene promoters and associates with c-Jun and c-Fos to activate transcription. CRTC1 consistently synergizes with the proto-oncogene c-Jun to promote cellular growth, whereas AP-1-dependent proliferation is abrogated in CRTC1-deficient cells. Remarkably, we demonstrate that CRTC1-Maml2 oncoprotein, which causes mucoepidermoid carcinomas, binds and activates both c-Jun and c-Fos. Consequently, ablation of AP-1 function disrupts the cellular transformation and proliferation mediated by this oncogene. Together, these data illustrate a novel mechanism required to couple mitogenic signals to the AP-1 gene regulatory program.",M1
19161993,"Perillyl alcohol attenuates Ras-ERK signaling to inhibit murine skin inflammation and tumorigenesis.In the present study, the chemopreventive effect of topical application of perillyl alcohol (POH) on 9,10-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-promoted skin tumorigenesis and its possible mechanisms of action in Swiss albino mice were investigated. We evaluated the effect of pretreatment of POH (6 and 12 mg/kg body weight) on TPA (2 microg/200 microl of acetone)-induced skin edema, hyperplasia, peroxidase damage and modulation in activities of catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione contents. Application of POH 30 min prior to TPA treatment, showed a protective effect in almost all the investigated parameters. Additionally, pretreatment with POH showed a significant inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and [(3)H] thymidine incorporation into epidermal DNA. In promotion phase, a significant reduction was found in tumor incidence and tumor burden in mice pretreated with POH (12 mg/kg body weight) with extension of the latency period from 4 to 8 weeks as compared to those treated with TPA alone. POH significantly suppressed the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway and induced apoptosis in Swiss albino mice skin. Our findings suggested that the chemopreventive efficacy of POH is probably due to the inhibition of oxidative stress responses, inhibition of the Ras cell proliferation pathway and induction of apoptosis in murine skin tumor promotion phase.",M1
19158151,"Dietary grape seed proanthocyanidins inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-caused skin tumor promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated mouse skin, which is associated with the inhibition of inflammatory responses.Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) possess anticarcinogenic activities. Here, we assessed the effects of dietary GSPs on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>)-induced skin tumor promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mouse skin. Administration of dietary GSPs (0.2 and 0.5%, wt/wt) supplemented with control AIN76A diet resulted in significant inhibition of TPA-induced skin tumor promotion in C3H/HeN mice. The mice treated with GSPs developed a significantly lower tumor burden in terms of the percentage of mice with tumors (P &lt; 0.05), total number of tumors per group (P &lt; 0.01, n = 20) and total tumor volume per tumor-bearing mouse (P &lt; 0.01-0.001) as compared with the mice that received the control diet. GSPs also delayed the malignant progression of papillomas into carcinomas. As TPA-induced inflammatory responses are used routinely as markers of skin tumor promotion, we assessed the effect of GSPs on biomarkers of TPA-induced inflammation. Immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting revealed that GSPs significantly inhibited expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and markers of proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1) in both the DMBA-initiated/TPA-promoted mouse skin and skin tumors. In short-term experiments in which the mouse skin was treated with acute or multiple TPA applications, we found that dietary GSPs inhibited TPA-induced edema, hyperplasia, leukocytes infiltration, myeloperoxidase, COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in the mouse skin. The inhibitory effect of GSPs was also observed against other structurally different skin tumor promoter-induced inflammation in the skin. Together, our results show that dietary GSPs inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in mouse skin and that the inhibition of skin tumorigenesis by GSPs is associated with the inhibition of inflammatory responses caused by tumor promoters.",M1
19154436,"Potent anti-inflammatory effects of two quinolinedione compounds, OQ1 and OQ21, mediated by dual inhibition of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2.BaCKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) have been suggested as key components in various inflammatory diseases. Here we examined the effects of new quinolinedione derivatives, 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-amino-5,8-quinolinedione (OQ1) and 6-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)-amino-5,8-quinolinedione (OQ21) on activity and expression of iNOS and COX-2 to explore their anti-inflammatory properties. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of OQ1 and OQ21 were assessed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS and COX-2 in murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7), along with isolated enzyme assays to measure enzyme inhibition. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) activation pathways were investigated to elucidate mechanisms underlying OQ-mediated suppression of the expression of iNOS and COX-2. In vivo anti-inflammatory activities of OQ compounds were evaluated in mouse ear oedema, induced by topical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<e>TPA</e>). KEY RESULTS: LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by OQ1 and OQ21 through the attenuation of iNOS expression as well as iNOS activity. Down-regulation of iNOS followed blocking of NFkappaB activation, as assessed by inhibitory kappaB degradation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NFkappaB. Synthesis and accumulation of prostaglandin E(2) were also suppressed by OQ1 and OQ21. LPS-induced COX-2 expression and cellular COX-2 activities were attenuated by OQ1 and OQ21. Consistent with these results, OQ1 showed potent anti-inflammatory effects in mouse ear oedema induced by TPA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The novel quinolinedione derivatives, OQ1 and OQ21, showed potent anti-inflammatory activity through dual inhibitory effects on iNOS and COX-2, suggesting that OQ derivatives might provide a new therapeutic modality for chronic inflammatory diseases, refractory to conventional drug therapies.",M1
20463217,"Tissue plasminogen activator alters intracellular sequestration of zinc through interaction with the transporter ZIP4.Glutamatergic neurons contain free zinc packaged into neurotransmitter-loaded synaptic vesicles. Upon neuronal activation, the vesicular contents are released into the synaptic space, whereby the zinc modulates activity of postsynaptic neurons though interactions with receptors, transporters and exchangers. However, high extracellular concentrations of zinc trigger seizures and are neurotoxic if substantial amounts of zinc reenter the cells via ion channels and accumulate in the cytoplasm. Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), a secreted serine protease, is also proepileptic and excitotoxic. However, tPA counters zinc toxicity by promoting zinc import back into the neurons in a sequestered form that is nontoxic. Here, we identify the zinc influx transporter, ZIP4, as the pathway through which tPA mediates the zinc uptake. We show that ZIP4 is upregulated after excitotoxin stimulation of the mouse, male and female, hippocampus. ZIP4 physically interacts with tPA, correlating with an increased intracellular zinc influx and lysosomal sequestration. Changes in prosurvival signals support the idea that this sequestration results in neuroprotection. These experiments identify a mechanism via which neurons use tPA to efficiently neutralize the toxic effects of excessive concentrations of free zinc.",M2
20440070,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator is a neuroprotectant in the mouse hippocampus.The best-known function of the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) is as a thrombolytic enzyme. However, it is also found in structures of the brain that are highly vulnerable to hypoxia-induced cell death, where its association with neuronal survival is poorly understood. Here, we have demonstrated that hippocampal areas of the mouse brain lacking tPA activity are more vulnerable to neuronal death following an ischemic insult. We found that sublethal hypoxia, which elicits tolerance to subsequent lethal hypoxic/ischemic injury in a natural process known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), induced a rapid release of neuronal tPA. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with tPA induced tolerance against a lethal hypoxic insult applied either immediately following insult (early IPC) or 24 hours later (delayed IPC). tPA-induced early IPC was independent of the proteolytic activity of tPA and required the engagement of a member of the LDL receptor family. In contrast, tPA-induced delayed IPC required the proteolytic activity of tPA and was mediated by plasmin, the NMDA receptor, and PKB phosphorylation. We also found that IPC in vivo increased tPA activity in the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) layer and Akt phosphorylation in the hippocampus, as well as ischemic tolerance in wild-type but not tPA- or plasminogen-deficient mice. These data show that tPA can act as an endogenous neuroprotectant in the murine hippocampus.",M2
20431084,"Endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in failed intravenous tissue plasminogen activator versus non-intravenous tissue plasminogen activator patients: revascularization and outcomes stratified by the site of arterial occlusions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial mechanical thrombectomy is a therapeutic option for acute ischemic stroke patients failing intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV <e>tPA</e>). We compared patients treated by mechanical embolus removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI) thrombectomy after failed IV tPA with those treated with thrombectomy alone. METHODS: We pooled MERCI and Multi MERCI study patients, grouped them either as failed IV tPA or non-IV tPA, and assessed revascularization rates, procedural complications, symptomatic hemorrhage rates, clinical outcomes, and mortality. We also evaluated outcomes stratified by the occlusion site and final revascularization. RESULTS: Among 305 patients, 48 failed, and 257 were ineligible for IV tPA. Nonresponders to IV tPA trended toward a higher revascularization rate (73% versus 63%) and less mortality (27.7% versus 40.1%) and had similar rates of symptomatic hemorrhage and procedural complications. Favorable 90-day outcomes were similar in failed and non-IV tPA patients (38% versus 31%), with no difference according to occlusion site. Among patients failing IV tPA, good outcomes tended to occur more frequently in revascularized patients (47.1% versus 15.4%), although this relationship was attributable solely to middle cerebral artery and not internal carotid artery occlusions, with no difference in mortality. Among IV tPA-ineligible patients, revascularization correlated with good outcome (47.4% versus 4.4%) and less mortality (28.5% versus 59.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The risks of hemorrhage and procedure-related complications after mechanical thrombectomy do not differ with respect to previous IV tPA administration. Thrombectomy after IV tPA achieves similar rates of good outcomes, a tendency toward lower mortality, and similar revascularization rates when stratified by clot location. Good outcomes correlate with successful revascularization except with internal carotid artery occlusions in tPA-nonresponders.",M2
20422794,"A review of barriers to thrombolytic therapy: implications for nursing care in the emergency department.Despite stroke being the third leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the United States, less than 7% of stroke survivors receive tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) in the treatment of acute stroke. The purpose of this review was to determine what research is available on barriers to tPA use and to determine gaps in the literature. A search of the literature was conducted using Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, and PubMed. Keywords were stroke, emergency, nursing, thrombolytics, cerebrovascular accident, ischemia, intervention, tPA, and barriers. Pertinent references from articles obtained were searched as well. The search yielded 45 articles for review. Barriers to tPA use were found in both prehospital and in-hospital settings. Prehospital delays were related to contacting primary care physicians, mode of arrival to the hospital, and survivors' lack of knowledge regarding stroke. Sources of in-hospital delays included non-stroke center status, lack of training of emergency department staff, delays in computed tomography scans, and poor understanding regarding priority stroke treatment (e.g., mild or improving symptoms and disparities related to age, gender, and race). Future research to evaluate the impact of nursing care and attitudes toward stroke patients on the administration of tPA is recommended.",M2
20406488,"Genome response to tissue plasminogen activator in experimental ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND: Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) is known to have functions beyond fibrinolysis in acute ischemic stroke, such as blood brain barrier disruption. To further delineate tPA functions in the blood, we examined the gene expression profiles induced by tPA in a rat model of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: tPA differentially expressed 929 genes in the blood of rats (p &lt;or= 0.05, fold change &gt;or= |1.2|). Genes identified had functions related to modulation of immune cells. tPA gene expression was found to be dependent on the reperfusion status of cerebral vasculature. The majority of genes regulated by tPA were different from genes regulated by ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: tPA modulates gene expression in the blood of rats involving immune cells in a manner that is dependent on the status of vascular reperfusion. These non-fibrinolytic activities of tPA in the blood serve to better understand tPA-related complications.",M2
20405577,"Signaling, delivery and age as emerging issues in the benefit/risk ratio outcome of <e>tPA</e> For treatment of CNS ischemic disorders.Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. While tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the only FDA-approved treatment for ischemic stroke, clinical use of tPA has been constrained to roughly 3% of eligible patients because of the danger of intracranial hemorrhage and a narrow 3 h time window for safe administration. Basic science studies indicate that tPA enhances excitotoxic neuronal cell death. In this review, the beneficial and deleterious effects of tPA in ischemic brain are discussed along with emphasis on development of new approaches toward treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. In particular, roles of tPA-induced signaling and a novel delivery system for tPA administration based on tPA coupling to carrier red blood cells will be considered as therapeutic modalities for increasing tPA benefit/risk ratio. The concept of the neurovascular unit will be discussed in the context of dynamic relationships between tPA-induced changes in cerebral hemodynamics and histopathologic outcome of CNS ischemia. Additionally, the role of age will be considered since thrombolytic therapy is being increasingly used in the pediatric population, but there are few basic science studies of CNS injury in pediatric animals.",M2

Combination percutaneous transcatheter directed pharmacological and mechanical thrombolysis has become extremely useful in these difficult cases.",M2
20375933,"Ezetimibe therapy and its influence on oxidative stress and fibrinolytic activity.OBJECTIVE: The effect of ezetimibe on blood lipids, oxidative stress, and fibrinolytic activity in hyperlipidemic patients was investigated after three months of therapy. METHODS: Thirty hyperlipidemic patients were treated for twelve weeks with ezetimibe 10 mg/day. A healthy control group with matching age and gender was also included. Fasting blood glucose, lipid parameters, paraoxonase (PON1), protein carbonyl (PCO), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), 8-isoprostane (ISOPR), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), and PAI-1/t-PA levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Ezetimibe therapy for twelve weeks led to changes in lipid profile in accordance with the literature. Fibrinolytic activity parameters, PAI-1/tPA and tPA-1 decreased, whereas PAI-1 levels did not change significantly. Antioxidant parameters, serum PON1 activity, and TAC levels increased significantly compared with the basal values. Oxidant parameters, oxLDL, ISOPR, and PCO (which is an indicator of oxidative protein damage) decreased significantly after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ezetimibe therapy has beneficial effects on fibrinolytic activity and homeostasis between oxidant and antioxidant activity in hyperlipidemic patients This may be through lowering lipid levels or other mechanisms such as decreasing insulin resistance and the pleiotropic effects of the drug.",M2
20338514,"High-throughput screening of enzymes by retroviral display using droplet-based microfluidics.During the last 25 years, display techniques such as phage display have become very powerful tools for protein engineering, especially for the selection of monoclonal antibodies. However, while this method is extremely efficient for affinity-based selections, its use for the selection and directed evolution of enzymes is still very restricted. Furthermore, phage display is not suited for the engineering of mammalian proteins that require posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation or membrane anchoring. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed a system in which structurally complex mammalian enzymes are displayed on the surface of retroviruses and encapsulated into droplets of a water-in-oil emulsion. These droplets are made and manipulated using microfluidic devices and each droplet serves as an independent reaction vessel. Compartmentalization of single retroviral particles in droplets allows efficient coupling of genotype and phenotype. Using tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) as a model enzyme, we show that, by monitoring the enzymatic reaction in each droplet (by fluorescence), quantitative measurement of tPA activity in the presence of different concentrations of the endogenous inhibitor PAI-1 can be made on-chip. On-chip fluorescence-activated droplet sorting allowed the processing of 500 samples per second and the specific collection of retroviruses displaying active wild-type tPA from a model library with a 1000-fold excess of retroviruses displaying a non-active control enzyme. During a single selection cycle, a more than 1300-fold enrichment of the active wild-type enzyme was demonstrated.",M2
20335564,"Safety of <e>tPA</e> in stroke mimics and neuroimaging-negative cerebral ischemia.BACKGROUND: Patients with acute neurologic symptoms may have other causes simulating ischemic stroke, called stroke mimics (SM), but they may also have averted strokes that do not appear as infarcts on neuroimaging, which we call neuroimaging-negative cerebral ischemia (NNCI). We determined the safety and outcome of IV thrombolysis within 3 hours of symptom onset in patients with SM and NNCI. METHODS: Patients treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset were identified from our stroke registry from June 2004 to October 2008. We collected admission NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, modified Rankin score (mRS), length of stay (LOS), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 512 treated patients, 21% were found not to have an infarct on follow-up imaging. In the SM group (14%), average age was 55 years, median admission NIHSS was 7, median discharge NIHSS was 0, median LOS was 3 days, and there were no instances of sICH. The most common etiologies were seizure, complicated migraine, and conversion disorder. In the NNCI group (7%), average age was 61 years, median admission NIHSS was 7, median discharge NIHSS was 0, median LOS was 3 days, and there were no instances of sICH. Nearly all SM (87%) and NNCI (91%) patients were functionally independent on discharge (mRS 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the safety of administering IV tissue plasminogen activator to patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia within 3 hours of symptom onset, even when the diagnosis ultimately is found not to be stroke or imaging does not show an infarct.",M2

20306914,"A comparison of three fibrinolytic agents in prevention of intra-abdominal adhesions.PURPOSE: Three different drugs affecting the coagulation process at various stages were studied for their effectiveness in preventing intra-peritoneal adhesion formation in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty female Wistar-Albino rats divided into four groups based on the drugs administered during the experimental laparotomy and caecal abrasion: the control group--no drug administered, the intra-peritoneal tissue plasminogen activator (<e>TPA</e>) group, the subcutaneous fondaparinux sodium (FS) group and the intra-peritoneal activated drotrecogin alfa (ADA) group. After two weeks, intra-peritoneal adhesions were macroscopically and microscopically scored. RESULTS: The macroscopic scores of the three groups were similar but all lower than the control group (p = 0.002). Inflammation (p = 0.023) and fibrosis (p = 0.019) scores were lower in just the ADA group when compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: All three agents were effective in preventing adhesions when compared to the control group. Nevertheless, ADA seemed the most effective except when considering clinical applicability, in which case FS seemed to offer the greatest advantage.",M2
20305489,"Exacerbation of perihematomal edema and sterile meningitis with intraventricular administration of tissue plasminogen activator in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.OBJECTIVE: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is associated with a poor outcome. External ventricular drainage together with clot lysis through intrathecal tissue plasminogen activator (IT-<e>tPA</e>) has been proposed as a promising therapy. However, recent experimental work has implicated tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the pathogenesis of cerebral edema. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients with IVH caused by primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage who underwent external ventricular drainage without surgical evacuation between January 2001 and June 2008. Of these 30 patients, we identified 13 who received IT-tPA. The remaining 17 patients served as controls. Hemorrhage, edema volume, and IVH score were determined on admission and by follow-up computed tomographic scans for 96 hours after admission. Discharge outcome was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the treatment and controls in terms of age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Graeb and LeRoux IVH scores, or intracerebral hemorrhage volume on admission. IT-tPA resulted in more rapid clearance of IVH as determined by the 96-hour decrease in both the Graeb IVH score (tPA, 3.00 +/- .55; control, 1.00 +/- 0.57; P = .05) and the LeRoux IVH score (tPA, 6.2 +/- 0.80; control, 2.25 +/- 1.32; P = .05). Patients treated with IT-tPA demonstrated significantly larger peak ratios of edema to intracerebral hemorrhage volume (1.24 +/- 0.14 vs 0.70 +/- 0.08 in controls; P = .002). Additionally, increased rates of sterile meningitis (46% vs 12%; P = .049) and a trend toward shunt dependence (38% vs 6%; P = .06) were observed in the tPA cohort. Nevertheless, no significant differences in outcome at discharge or length of hospital stay were observed between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Although IT-tPA hastens the resolution of IVH, it may worsen perihematomal edema formation. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings and to determine whether outcome is adversely affected by IT-tPA administration.",M2
20302038,"Enhancement effect of ethanol on lipopolysaccharide-induced procoagulant status in human umbilical endothelial cells.In spite of the inhibitory effects of ethanol (EtOH) on platelet function, soft blood clots are often observed in cadaveric blood in cases of sudden death after alcohol ingestion. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we have focused on the role of vascular endothelial cells. We tried to investigate the effects of EtOH and LPS on endothelial cells from various perspectives; thrombogenic factor (Von Willebrand factor, VWF), fibrinolytic factor (tissue plasminogen activator, <e>tPA</e>) and inflammatory factor (Interleukin-6, IL-6). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with various concentrations of EtOH (0-160 mM) with or without LPS. Treatment with EtOH and LPS increased VWF release from HUVECs without enhancement mRNA expression. Treatment with 40 mM of EtOH also increased IL-6 release from HUVECs without enhancement mRNA expression. Although EtOH inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA expression, 20 mM of EtOH still had an increasing effect on the release of IL-6. These doses of EtOH are consistent with a moderate drunkenness level in a normal person. On the other hand, mRNA expression and release reaction of tPA were not affected by EtOH and LPS addition. In conclusion, EtOH enhances procoagulant status via VWF release and IL-6 production cooperation with LPS and may contribute to soft blood clot formation in cadaveric blood.",M2
20228588,"Hyper-acute stroke patients associated with aortic dissection.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) can improve patient outcomes in acute stroke if administered within 3 hours of onset. However, patients with aortic dissection should avoid tPA therapy due to the possibility of tPA administration inducing rupture of the aortic dissection. We studied the frequency and clinical characteristics of stroke patients presenting with aortic dissection within 3 hours of onset. METHODS: Among stroke patients admitted to our hospital within 3 hours of onset, we examined the frequency of patients presenting with aortic dissection. Next, we examined the clinical characteristics of such patients, including cases published on PubMed. RESULTS: Among 208 stroke patients presenting within 3 hours of onset, 2 patients (1%) displayed aortic dissection. Carotid duplex ultrasonography could exclude them from tPA therapy. For 19 patients, including 17 published cases from PubMed, median age was 61.0 years, 47% were women, right pulse weakness was seen in 70%, chest pain in 22%, and lone left hemiparesis in 72%. In 6 patients, carotid ultrasonography showed arterial dissection due to aortic dissection. CONCLUSION: Aortic dissection may not be a rare complication in acute stroke within 3 hours of onset. Right pulse weakness and left hemiparesis are often present. Carotid ultrasonography may be useful in diagnosing aortic dissection before tPA infusion.",M2
20228273,"Polyphosphate modifies the fibrin network and down-regulates fibrinolysis by attenuating binding of <e>tPA</e> and plasminogen to fibrin.Activated platelets secrete a negatively charged polymer, polyphosphate (polyP). Here, we explore the interactions of polyP with fibrin(ogen) and its effect on fibrin structure and fibrinolysis. Electrophoretic mobility and binding assays indicate that polyP interacts with fibrinogen and soluble fibrin. Clots formed in the presence of polyP exhibited reduced turbidity and permeability indicative of a tighter fibrin network, but these changes were not related to cross-linking or fibrinopeptide release. Microscopy showed a change in fibrin distribution in clots formed with polyP; with formation of tight aggregates of fibrin fibers interspaced with large pores in contrast to homogenous fiber distribution in control clots. Lysis by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen or plasmin was delayed in clots formed with polyP and depended on both the activator and polyP concentration. Adding polyP to the clot after fibrin formation or to repolymerizing soluble fibrin did not affect lysis, indicating changes induced by polyP occur at the level of conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Surface plasmon resonance showed that the presence of polyP reduced the binding of both plasminogen and tPA to partially lysed fibrin surfaces. These data show that polyP directly influences fibrin architecture and attenuates fibrinolysis through reduced binding of fibrinolytic proteins.",M2
20223397,"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and stroke in the elderly.OBJECTIVE: Since publication in 1995 of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV <e>tPA</e>) for acute ischemic stroke, the benefit and frequency of use of IV tPA in the elderly have remained uncertain. METHODS: We obtained data from the NINDS trial to summarize outcomes for randomized subjects older than 80 years. We used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a cohort study of 5888 elderly participants from 4 US communities followed longitudinally for stroke since 1989 to estimate the use of and hospital outcome after IV tPA in older adults following publication of the trial in 1995. RESULTS: In the NINDS trial, 44 subjects older than 80 years were randomized, and their 3-month functional outcomes were not significantly improved with IV tPA. Of 25 randomized to IV tPA, 4 experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages within 36 hours of treatment. Compared with younger patients, older patients were 2.87 times more likely to experience a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours of IV tPA (95% confidence interval, 1.04-7.93). Of 227 Cardiovascular Health Study participants hospitalized for ischemic stroke between 1995 and 2002, seven, whose mean age was 84 years, were treated with IV tPA (3.1%; 95% confidence interval 1.2-6.2). Two had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, 3 failed to improve, and 2 of the 7 had good outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the need to clarify the risk-benefit profile of IV tPA in ischemic stroke victims who are older than 80 years.",M2
20219643,"Tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator in human epileptogenic pathologies.A growing body of evidence demonstrates the involvement of plasminogen activators (PAs) in a number of physiologic and pathologic events in the CNS. Induction of both tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) has been observed in different experimental models of epilepsy and tPA has been implicated in the mechanisms underlying seizure activity. We investigated the expression and the cellular distribution of tPA and uPA in several epileptogenic pathologies, including hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n=6), and developmental glioneuronal lesions, such as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD, n=6), cortical tubers in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n=6) and in gangliogliomas (GG; n=6), using immuno-cytochemical, western blot and real-time quantitative PCR analysis. TPA and uPA immunostaining showed increased expression within the epileptogenic lesions compared to control specimens in both glial and neuronal cells (hippocampal neurons in HS and dysplastic neurons in FCD, TSC and GG specimens). Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed expression of both proteins in astrocytes and microglia, as well as in microvascular endothelium. Immunoblot demonstrated also up-regulation of the uPA receptor (uPAR; P&lt;0.05). Increased expression of tPA, uPA, uPAR and tissue PA inhibitor type mRNA levels was also detected by PCR analysis in different epileptogenic pathologies (P&lt;0.05). Our data support the role of PA system components in different human focal epileptogenic pathologies, which may critically influence neuronal activity, inflammatory response, as well as contributing to the complex remodeling of the neuronal networks occurring in epileptogenic lesions.",M2
20203318,"Combination treatment with VELCADE and low-dose tissue plasminogen activator provides potent neuroprotection in aged rats after embolic focal ischemia.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment with a selective proteasome inhibitor, VELCADE, in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) extended the therapeutic window to 6 hours in young rats after stroke. However, stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the elderly. The present study investigated the effect of VELCADE in combination with a low-dose tPA on aged rats after embolic stroke. METHODS: Male Wistar rats at the age of 18 to 20 months were treated with VELCADE (0.2 mg/kg) alone, a low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) alone, combination of VELCADE and tPA, or saline 2 hours after embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion. To test the contribution of endothelial nitric oxide synthase to VELCADE-mediated neuroprotection, endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout and wild-type mice were treated with VELCADE (0.5 mg/kg) 2 hours after embolic stroke. RESULTS: Treatment with VELCADE significantly reduced infarct volume, whereas tPA alone did not reduce infarct volume and aggravated blood-brain barrier disruption in aged rats compared with saline-treated rats. However, the combination treatment significantly enhanced the reduction of infarct volume, which was associated with an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity compared with saline-treated rats. Additionally, the combination treatment promoted thrombolysis and did not increase the incidence of hemorrhage transformation. VELCADE significantly reduced lesion volume in wild-type mice but failed to significantly reduce lesion volume in endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VELCADE exerts a neuroprotective effect in aged rats after stroke. The combination of VELCADE with the low-dose tPA further amplifies the neuroprotective effect. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase at least partly contributes to VELCADE-mediated neuroprotection after stroke.",M2
20194917,"Differences in stroke outcome based on sex.OBJECTIVE: Stroke thrombolysis may have a differential effect by sex. We sought to examine the relationship between sex and outcome after thrombolysis. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of stroke patients from the Registry of Canadian Stroke Network phase 1 (June 2001-February 2002) and phase 2 (June 2002-December 2002). Variables including demographics, history, clinical data, process measures, and outcome were analyzed. The primary outcomes were the Stroke Impact Scale-16 score (SIS-16) and mortality at 6 months. We compared the outcomes of the thrombolyzed and nonthrombolyzed cohorts and examined the data for a tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>)-by-sex interaction on the 2 primary outcomes. RESULTS: The overall proportion of patients who achieved an excellent outcome (SIS-16 &gt;75) was not different by gender. However, the proportion of patients achieving an excellent outcome in the non-tPA cohort was much greater in males, with an absolute risk difference of 11.8%. A multiplicative treatment by sex interaction was evident (p = 0.054). This interaction was not present for stroke case fatality. CONCLUSIONS: Women fared poorly compared to men in the placebo groups, but this negative prognostic sex effect was neutralized by thrombolysis.",M2
20193777,"A stroke preparedness RCT in a multi-ethnic cohort: design and methods.BACKGROUND: Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke (IS), is significantly underutilized likely due to poor lay information about stroke as an emergency. In order to improve outcomes in acute IS, it is critical to raise awareness and recognition of stroke symptoms particularly among minority populations. This manuscript describes the application of a stroke preparedness behavioral intervention and includes baseline information in a multi-ethnic population of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors. METHODS: In the Stroke Warning Information and Faster Treatment Study (SWIFT), we prospectively identified, and randomized IS and TIA patients to determine efficacy of a culturally tailored interactive stroke preparedness strategy. Data collected at baseline included acute stroke parameters, stroke knowledge, severity, social resources and vascular risk assessment. RESULTS: Of the 736 enrolled to date, 76% were IS and 24% TIA events. The cohort was 51% female: 45% Hispanic, 26% White and 25% Black. Over 75% reported hypertension, 36% diabetes, and 16% cardiac disease. Mean time from onset to emergency department (ED) arrival was 46h (median 13h) differing significantly between Whites (mean 52h, median 11h) and Blacks (mean 52h, median 17h) versus Hispanics (mean 39h, median 11h). Knowledge that a stroke occurs in the brain differed significantly by between Whites (85%), Blacks (64%), Hispanics (66%, p&lt;0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Disparities remain in both action and knowledge surrounding acute stroke. Use of written information has not proven an effective means of changing health behaviors. We propose an interactive culturally tailored intervention to address behavioral change in acute stroke.",M2
20175867,"Current and future recanalization strategies for acute ischemic stroke.In a quest for stroke treatment, reperfusion proved to be the first key to the puzzle. Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), the first and currently the only approved treatment, is also the fastest way to initiate thrombolyis for acute ischemic stroke. tPA works by induction of mostly partial recanalization since stroke patients often have large thrombus burden. Thus, early augmentation of fibrinolysis and multi-modal approach to improve recanalization are desirable. This review focuses on the following strategies available to clinicians now or being tested in clinical trials: (a) faster initiation of tPA infusion; (b) sonothrombolysis; (c) intra-arterial revascularization, bridging intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and aspiration; and (d) novel experimental approaches. Despite these technological advances, no single strategy was yet proven to be a 'silver bullet' solution to reverse acute ischemic stroke. Better outcomes are expected with faster treatment leading to early, at times just partial flow improvement rather than achieving complete recanalization with lengthy procedures. Arterial re-occlusion can occur with any of these approaches, and it remains a challenge since it leads to poor outcomes and no clinical trial data are available yet to determine safe strategies to prevent or reverse re-occlusion.",M2
20156421,"Decreased serotonin levels associated with behavioral disinhibition in tissue plasminogen activator deficient (<e>tPA</e>-/-) mice.Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) is a serine protease expressed in different areas of the mammalian brain. It has been used clinically to dissolve clots and shown to have a role in neurodegeneration. Early studies suggested that tPA plays an important role in the processes of learning and memory, demonstrated at the level of behavior and synaptic plasticity. Herein, we extend the behavioral characterization of these mice to the related dimension of exploratory-related behavior using an extensive battery of behavioral tests as well as the neurotransmitter metabolism associated with the behavioral measures. Our results indicate a behavior tendency in these mice consistent with  impulsivity  or reduced exploratory inhibition. These patterns are accompanied by decreased levels of serotonin in several brain regions important in behavioral regulation in the tPA(-/-) mice compared to control animals. Systemic administration of fluoxetine reversed the behavioral disinhibition of tPA(-/-) mice, further supporting an important alteration in behavior regulation mediated by serotonin systems as underappreciated but important element of the behavioral phenotype of these animals.",M2
20139502,"Does intravenous rtPA benefit patients in the absence of CT angiographically visible intracranial occlusion?BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), we postulated that the presence of intracranial occlusion on CT angiography (CTA) modifies the benefit of thrombolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified patients with acute ischemic stroke in our CTA database between May 2002 and August 2007. All the patients had a CTA within 12 h of onset, a premorbid modified Rankin scale (mRS) &lt; or = 1, and a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score(NIHSS)f &gt; or = 6. The primary outcome was early effectiveness of tPA defined as an NIHSS score of &lt; or = 2 at 24 h or a 4-point NIHSS improvement at 24 h. Secondary outcome included mRS &lt; or = 1 at 90 days. The relationship between intracranial occlusion on CTA and benefit of tPA was assessed using a test for interaction. RESULTS: A total of 287 patients met the criteria [occlusion present N =168; (98 with tPA; 70 without tPA) and occlusion absent N = 119; (52 with tPA; 67 without tPA)]. Those with intracranial occlusion were likely to have more severe strokes (NIHSS &gt; or = 15; P &lt; 0.001) and abnormal brain imaging (ASPECTS &lt; or =7; P &lt; 0.001). For outcome of 4-point NIHSS score improvement at 24 h, benefit from tPA was observed only among patients with a visible occlusion (absolute difference in favor of tPA: 20.4% vs. 0.7%; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, thrombolysis produced a better early clinical response among patients with intracranial occlusion, which needs to be confirmed in stroke thrombolysis trials.",M2
20118811,"Low-dose systemic thrombolytic therapy for deep vein thrombosis in pediatric patients.Reduction of thrombus size and recanalization of vessels after deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are important goals to prevent recurrent thrombosis and development of postthrombotic syndrome. Thrombolysis is effective but concern for bleeding complications has limited its use in children. We retrospectively analyzed data for children with DVT treated with a low-dose systemic tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) regimen. Twenty-three pediatric patients (12 males and 11 females, median age 12 y) received low-dose systemic tPA, initiated at 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg/h for a median of 24 hours (range 12 to 48 h). Of the 20 patients imaged within 24 hours of therapy, 6 (30%) showed partial to complete thrombus resolution. Eight patients subsequently received increased tPA at 0.12 mg/kg/h for an additional 24 hours (range 12 to 36 h). Six of these 8 (75%) patients responded to the increased dose. The overall response at the end of thrombolytic therapy was 59% (13/22). Two bleeding complications occurred without serious sequelae. Low-dose tPA administration leads to a substantial response rate although the risk of bleeding remains unclear. A prospective multicenter trial of low-dose thrombolytic therapy in children with acute DVT is warranted.",M2
20110420,"Tissue type plasminogen activator regulates myeloid-cell dependent neoangiogenesis during tissue regeneration.Ischemia of the heart, brain, and limbs is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment with tissue type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) can dissolve blood clots and can ameliorate the clinical outcome in ischemic diseases. But the underlying mechanism by which tPA improves ischemic tissue regeneration is not well understood. Bone marrow (BM)-derived myeloid cells facilitate angiogenesis during tissue regeneration. Here, we report that a serpin-resistant form of tPA by activating the extracellular proteases matrix metalloproteinase-9 and plasmin expands the myeloid cell pool and mobilizes CD45(+)CD11b(+) proangiogenic, myeloid cells, a process dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and Kit ligand signaling. tPA improves the incorporation of CD11b(+) cells into ischemic tissues and increases expression of neoangiogenesis-related genes, including VEGF-A. Remarkably, transplantation of BM-derived tPA-mobilized CD11b(+) cells and VEGFR-1(+) cells, but not carrier-mobilized cells or CD11b(-) cells, accelerates neovascularization and ischemic tissue regeneration. Inhibition of VEGF signaling suppresses tPA-induced neovascularization in a model of hind limb ischemia. Thus, tPA mobilizes CD11b(+) cells from the BM and increases systemic and local (cellular) VEGF-A, which can locally promote angiogenesis during ischemic recovery. tPA might be useful to induce therapeutic revascularization in the growing field of regenerative medicine.",M2
20104930,"Sonothrombolysis in the management of acute ischemic stroke.Multiple in vitro and animal models have demonstrated the efficacy of ultrasound to enhance fibrinolysis. Mechanical pressure waves produced by ultrasound energy improve the delivery and penetration of alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [<e>tPA</e>]) inside the clot. In human stroke, the CLOTBUST phase II trial showed that the combination of alteplase plus 2 hours of continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) increased recanalization rates, producing a trend toward better functional outcomes compared with alteplase alone. Other small clinical trials also showed an improvement in clot lysis when transcranial color-coded sonography was combined with alteplase. In contrast, low-frequency ultrasound increased the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate in a clinical trial. Administration of microbubbles (MBs) may further enhance the effect of ultrasound on thrombolysis by lowering the ultrasound-energy threshold needed to induce acoustic cavitation. Initial clinical trials have been encouraging, and a multicenter international study, TUCSON, determined a dose of newly developed MBs that can be safely administered with alteplase and TCD. Even in the absence of alteplase, the ultrasound energy, with or without MBs, could increase intrinsic fibrinolysis. The intra-arterial administration of ultrasound with the EKOS NeuroWave catheter is another ultrasound application for acute stroke that is currently being studied in the IMS III trial. Operator-independent devices, different MB-related techniques, and other ultrasound parameters for improving and spreading sonothrombolysis are being tested.",M2

20101595,"Open adhesiolysis is more effective in reducing adhesion reformation than laparoscopic adhesiolysis in an experimental model.BACKGROUND: This study compared adhesion reformation after open and laparoscopic adhesiolysis in a rat model. METHODS: Adhesions were induced by surgically creating ischaemic buttons on the peritoneal side wall. After 7 days the animals underwent laparoscopy with carbon dioxide insufflation or laparotomy to score and lyse adhesions. Peritoneal tissue and fluid were collected after 24 h in a subset of animals, and adhesion reformation was scored 7 days after lysis in the remainder. Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha mRNA, and total fibrinolytic activity were assessed. The abdomen of non-operated animals was insufflated for 7, 15 or 30 min with carbon dioxide, after which tPA and PAI-1 mRNA and total fibrinolytic activity were measured. RESULTS: Animals that underwent open adhesiolysis had 60 per cent fewer reformed adhesions than the laparoscopic adhesiolysis group (P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in tPA activity or tPA, PAI-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA between groups, but TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the open group. Carbon dioxide insufflation did not affect peritoneal tPA activity. CONCLUSION: Open adhesiolysis may be more beneficial in minimizing adhesion reformation in the management of adhesion-related complications.",M2
20090317,"Statin use and functional outcome after tissue plasminogen activator treatment in acute ischaemic stroke.BACKGROUND: Preliminary findings suggest that statins may have a neuroprotective effect in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. This study investigated whether patients on prior statin therapy and treated with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) for acute ischaemic stroke have a better functional outcome than statin-naïve patients. METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study of 476 acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with tPA we investigated the relationship between prior statin use and functional outcome at 3 months, the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) and early in-hospital mortality. Ischaemic stroke subtypes were defined according to the TOAST classification. Favourable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score &lt; or =2. RESULTS: Of the 476 patients included, 98 (20.6%) used a statin at stroke presentation. In the entire cohort, 45.6% of patients had a favourable outcome with no difference between patients with or without statin therapy (45.9 vs. 45.5%, p = 0.94). In the multivariable analysis, statin use was not associated with favourable outcome (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-1.9, p = 0.87). In none of the different stroke subtype groups was statin use associated with favourable outcome. Finally, statin use was not an independent risk factor of SICH or of early in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Prior statin therapy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with tPA is not associated with a more favourable outcome, and this is independent of stroke subtype.",M2

However, an unappreciated physicochemical property of xenon has been that this gas also binds to the active site of a series of serine proteases. Because the active site of serine proteases is structurally conserved, we have hypothesized and investigated whether xenon may alter the catalytic efficiency of tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), a serine protease that is the only approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke today. Here, using molecular modeling and in vitro and in vivo studies, we show (1) xenon is a tPA inhibitor; (2) intraischemic xenon dose dependently inhibits tPA-induced thrombolysis and subsequent reduction of ischemic brain damage; (3) postischemic xenon virtually suppresses ischemic brain damage and tPA-induced brain hemorrhages and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, these data indicate (1) xenon should not be administered before or together with tPA therapy; (2) xenon could be a golden standard for treating acute ischemic stroke if given after tPA-induced reperfusion, with both unique neuroprotective and antiproteolytic (anti-hemorrhaging) properties.",M2
20087363,"Pretreatment diffusion- and perfusion-MR lesion volumes have a crucial influence on clinical response to stroke thrombolysis.We hypothesized that pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) lesion volumes may have influenced clinical response to thrombolysis in the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET). In 98 patients randomized to intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) or placebo 3 to 6 h after stroke onset, we examined increasing acute DWI and PWI lesion volumes (Tmax-with 2-sec delay increments), and increasing PWI/DWI mismatch ratios, on the odds of both excellent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS): 0 to 1) and poor (mRS: 5 to 6) clinical outcome. Patients with very large PWI lesions (most had internal carotid artery occlusion) had increased odds ratio (OR) of poor outcome with IV-tPA (58% versus 25% placebo; OR=4.13, P=0.032 for Tmax +2-sec volume &gt;190 mL). Excellent outcome from tPA treatment was substantially increased in patients with DWI lesions &lt;18 mL (77% versus 18% placebo, OR=15.0, P&lt;0.001). Benefit from tPA was also seen with DWI lesions up to 25 mL (69% versus 29% placebo, OR=5.5, P=0.03), but not for DWI lesions &gt;25 mL. In contrast, increasing mismatch ratios did not influence the odds of excellent outcome with tPA. Clinical responsiveness to IV-tPA, and stroke outcome, depends more on baseline DWI and PWI lesion volumes than the extent of perfusion-diffusion mismatch.",M2
20079732,"Breast cancer cell surface annexin II induces cell migration and neoangiogenesis via <e>tPA</e> dependent plasmin generation.Annexin II, an abundant phospholipids binding cell surface protein, binds tPA and functions as a regulator of fibrinolysis. Annexin II also mediates angiogenesis and enhances tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism supporting this role is not known. Using human breast cancer model we show that invasive human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) synthesize annexin II and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In vitro both annexin II and tPA interacts which in turn convert zymogen plasminogen to reactive enzyme plasmin. Cell surface produced plasmin inhibited the migration of MDA-MB231 cells. Silencing of annexin II gene in MDA-MB231 cells abolished tPA binding therefore inhibited tPA dependent plasmin generation. These annexin II suppressed MDA-MB231 cells showed reduced motility. Immunohistochemical analysis of prediagnosed clinical specimens showed abundant secretion of tPA and expression of annexin II on the surface of invasive human breast cancer cells which correlates with neovascularization of the tumor. Taken together, these data indicate that annexin II may regulate localized plasmin generation in breast cancer. This may be an early event switching breast cancer from the prevascular phase to the vascular phase and thus contributing to aggressive cancer with the possibility of metastasis. The data provide a mechanism explaining the role of annexin II in breast cancer progression and suggest that annexin II may be an attractive target for therapeutic strategies aimed to inhibit angiogenesis and breast cancer.",M2
20068577,"Annexin A2 combined with low-dose <e>tPA</e> improves thrombolytic therapy in a rat model of focal embolic stroke.Recent studies showed that soluble annexin A2 dramatically increases tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasmin generation in vitro, and reduces thrombus formation in vivo. Here, we hypothesize that combining annexin A2 with tPA can significantly enhance thrombolysis efficacy, so that lower doses of tPA can be applied in ischemic stroke to avoid neurotoxic and hemorrhagic complications. In vitro activity assays confirmed tPA-specific amplification of plasmin generation by recombinant annexin A2. In a rat focal embolic stroke model, combination therapy with tPA and recombinant annexin A2 protein at 2 h post-ischemia decreased the effective dose required for tPA by four-fold and reduced brain infarction. Combining annexin A2 with tPA also lengthened the time window for thrombolysis. Compared with tPA (10 mg/kg) alone, the combination of annexin A2 (5 mg/kg) plus low-dose tPA (2.5 mg/kg) significantly enhanced fibrinolysis, attenuated mortality, brain infarction, and hemorrhagic transformation, even when administered at 4 h post-ischemia. Combination with recombinant annexin A2, the effective thrombolytic dose of tPA can be decreased. As a result, brain hemorrhage and infarction are reduced, and the time window for stroke reperfusion prolonged. Our present findings provide a promising new approach for enhancing tPA-based thrombolytic stroke therapy.",M2
20064753,"In vitro investigations into enhancement of <e>tPA</e> bioavailability in whole blood clots using pulsed-high intensity focused ultrasound exposures.Investigations were carried out on the manner by which pulsed-high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) enhances the effectiveness of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in whole blood clots, in vitro. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) of the surface of the clots showed that the exposures increased exposed fibrin, as well as the number of openings to more interior regions. These findings were supported by fluorescent antibody labeling of tPA in frozen sections of clots treated post-HIFU. Here, improved accumulation at the surface and penetration of the tPA into the clots were observed in those treated with HIFU. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was also performed, indicating that the diffusion coefficient increased 6.3-fold for fluorescently labeled dextrans, comparable in size to tPA, in the HIFU-treated clots. Improved understanding of the manner by which pulsed--HIFU exposures can improve the effectiveness of thrombolytics will help optimize the exposures for this application and potentially facilitate translation to the clinic.",M2
20060006,"Blood-brain barrier permeability and <e>tPA</e>-mediated neurotoxicity.Tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) can induce neuronal apoptosis, disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and promote dilation of the cerebral vasculature. The timing, sequence and contributions of these and other deleterious effects of tPA and their contribution to post-ischemic brain damage after stroke, have not been fully elucidated. To dissociate the effects of tPA on BBB permeability, cerebral vasodilation and protease-dependent pathways, we developed several tPA mutants and PAI-1 derived peptides constructed by computerized homology modeling of tPA. Our data show that intravenous administration of human tPA to rats increases BBB permeability through a non-catalytic process that is associated with reversible neurotoxicity, brain damage, mortality and contributes significantly to its brief therapeutic window. Furthermore, our data show that inhibiting the effect of tPA on BBB function without affecting its catalytic activity, improves outcome and significantly extends its therapeutic window in mechanical as well as in thromboembolic models of stroke.",M2
20056931,"The benefits of intravenous thrombolysis relate to the site of baseline arterial occlusion in the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET).BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In ischemic stroke, the site of arterial obstruction has been shown to influence recanalization and clinical outcomes. However, this has not been studied in randomized controlled trials, nor has the impact of arterial obstruction site on reperfusion and infarct growth been assessed. We studied the influence of site and degree of arterial obstruction patients enrolled in the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET). METHODS: EPITHET was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) in the 3- to 6-hour time window. Arterial obstruction site and degree were rated on magnetic resonance angiography blinded to treatment allocation and outcomes. RESULTS: In 101 EPITHET patients, 87 had adequate quality magnetic resonance angiography, of whom 54 had baseline arterial obstruction. Infarct growth attenuation was greater in those with tPA treatment compared to placebo among patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) obstruction (P=0.037). The treatment benefit of tPA over placebo in attenuating infarct growth was greater for MCA than internal carotid artery (ICA) obstruction (P=0.060). With tPA treatment, good clinical outcome was more likely with MCA than with ICA obstruction (P=0.005). Most patients with ICA obstruction did not achieve good clinical outcome, whether treated with tPA (100%) or placebo (77%). The study was underpowered to prove any treatment benefit of tPA among patients with any or severe degree of arterial obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial obstruction site strongly predicts outcomes. ICA obstruction carries a uniformly poor prognosis, whereas good outcomes with MCA obstruction are associated with tPA therapy.",M2
20044531,"Safety and efficacy of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis is a promising new approach to facilitate reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. So far, 3 different ultrasound technologies were used to increase the thrombolytic activity of tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), including transcranial Doppler (TCD), transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD), and low-frequency ultrasound. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis compared to the current standard of care (intravenous tPA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Through Medline, Embase, and Cochrane database search, we identified and abstracted all studies of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis in acute cerebral ischemia. Principal investigators were contacted if data not available through peer-reviewed publication were needed. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and recanalization rates were compared between tPA, tPA+TCD+/-microspheres (microS), tPA+TCCD+/-microS, and tPA+low-frequency ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 6 randomized (n=224) and 3 nonrandomized (n=192) studies were identified. The rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in randomized studies were as follows: tPA+TCD, 3.8% (95% CI, 0%-11.2%); tPA+TCCD, 11.1% (95% CI, 0%-28.9%); tPA+low-frequency ultrasound, 35.7% (95% CI, 16.2%- 61.4%); and tPA alone, 2.9% (95% CI, 0%-8.4%). Complete recanalization rates were higher in patients receiving combination of TCD with tPA 37.2% (95% CI, 26.5%- 47.9%) compared with patients treated with tPA alone 17.2% (95% CI, 9.5%-24.9%). In 8 trials of high-frequency (TCD/TCCD) ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis, tPA+TCD/TCCD+/-microS was associated with a higher likelihood of complete recanalization (pooled OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.70-5.25; P=0.0001) when compared to tPA alone. High-frequency ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis was not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (pooled OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.44-3.60; P=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: The present safety and signal-of-efficacy data of high-frequency ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis should be taken into account in the design of future randomized controlled trials.",M2
20037915,"Pneumatic displacement of acute submacular hemorrhage with and without the use of tissue plasminogen activator.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of C(3)F(8) gas-assisted pneumatic displacement in the treatment of massive submacular hemorrhage, with and without the use of tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>). METHODS: Twenty-one eyes of 21 patients with recently developed (up to 10 days) dense submacular hemorrhage underwent intravitreal injection of pure C(3)F(8) gas (0.4-0.5 mL) followed by face-down positioning for pneumatic displacement. Seven of them received additional intravitreal injection of 25-50 microg tPA. The primary etiology of submacular hemorrhage was age-related macular degeneration (n=16), myopic choroidal neovascularization (n=2), retinal arterial macroaneurysm (n=2), and trauma (n=1). Visual acuity and displacement of hemorrhage were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Follow-up period was 6-12 months. Effective displacement of hemorrhage was obtained in 20 of 21 patients within 7 days. Final median Snellen visual acuity (0.18) was found significantly improved compared to baseline (0.03) (p&lt;0.001). Visual acuity improvement was similar in both groups (p=0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injection of C(3)F(8) effectively displaced thick submacular hemorrhage and improved visual acuity independently from primary cause. Additional tPA use in this study had no impact on the final outcomes.",M2
20026244,"Regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue plasminogen activator activity by alpha-synuclein in rat primary glial cells.It is increasingly evident that neuroinflammatory response is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we examined whether alpha-synuclein, a major components of Lewy body that has been implicated in the modulation of neuroinflammation, regulates MMP-9 and <e>tPA</e> activity, which plays important roles in neurodegeneration as well as regeneration processes, in cultured rat primary glial cells. Monomeric alpha-synuclein dose-dependently increased MMP-9 but not MMP-2 activity as well as mRNA level from cultured rat primary astrocytes and microglial cells. Maximal stimulation was observed at 50 nM alpha-synuclein. In contrast, the activity of tPA was decreased by alpha-synuclein with only marginal changes in the level of mRNA encoding tPA, if any. Interestingly, same concentration of alpha-synuclein aggregates did not induce MMP-9 activity. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein in rat primary astrocytes similarly increased MMP-9 activity. Treatment of alpha-synuclein increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the inhibition of ERK1/2 reversed the changes in MMP-9 and tPA activity. These results suggest further functional role of alpha-synuclein via regulation of protease systems through modulation of ERK1/2 activity in brain.",M2
19969306,"Efficacy of local instillation of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for restoring occluded central venous catheters in neonates.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of local instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) for restoring function to occluded central venous catheters (CVCs) in the neonatal population. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during September 2000 to April 2006 who received instillation of tPA for occluded CVCs. RESULTS: Among 18 infants who received tPA for occluded CVCs, gestational age at birth was 32.5 weeks, birth weight was 1550 g, and gestational age at tPA administration was 39 weeks, with 4 neonates &lt; or =32 weeks' gestational age at tPA administration; age at tPA use was 39 days (medians reported). Ten of 18 (55%) of CVC occlusions were successfully opened after using tPA. No bleeding complications of tPA were noted, including increased or new-onset intraventricular hemorrhage, overt bleeding, or changes in INR or partial thromboplastin time attributed to tPA use. Three patients (16.5%) had bacteremia within 7 days of tPA administration, and no catheter ruptures occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Local instillation of tPA was successful in restoring function to occluded CVCs in a significant proportion of neonates, although success rates were lower than that reported in populations of older age. Despite the vulnerability of neonates to the potential complications of tPA, no major complications were detected even among premature infants.",M2
19965846,"Safety of performing CT angiography in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis.OBJECTIVE: Exposure to contrast agents may cause nephrotoxicity. The safety of performing CT angiography without having knowledge of the baseline creatinine level in stroke patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) has not been established. METHODS: This is an observational cohort study, with a historical control group to evaluate the safety of CT angiography performed before tPA treatment given within 3 h of symptom onset. The CT angiography group represents all patients treated with tPA between September/2003 and November/2007 who had CT angiography. The control group consists of all patients treated with tPA between January 1999 and August 2003 when CT angiography was not performed. The primary outcome was a creatinine increase in 24-72 h compared with baseline; the secondary outcome was a creatinine increase by &gt; or = 44 micromol/l in 24-72 h and the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH). RESULTS: Baseline parameters between the CT angiography group (164 patients, age 70+/-11; 91 male) and the control group (77 patients, age 67+/-11; 45 male) were similar. In the CT angiography group, the mean creatinine increase was -0.89 mmol/l and in the control group 2.2 mmol/l (p=0.42). A creatinine increase of &gt; or = 44 micromol/l occurred in five patients (3%) in the CT angiography group and in three patients (4%) in the control group (p=0.50). Also, in the CT angiography group, eight patients (5%) had sICH as compared with three patients (4%) in the control group (p=0.73). CONCLUSION: Contrast agents given for CT angiography, performed in patients with normal and abnormal creatinine level, neither caused renal injury nor interfered with the safety of tPA treatment.",M2
19940272,"Unsuspected coagulopathy rarely prevents IV thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND: American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend initiating treatment with IV tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) in acute ischemic stroke patients without suspected coagulopathy prior to availability of clotting results; however, little or no data support this practice. We sought to identify how often blood clotting abnormalities were responsible for withholding IV tPA at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of our prospectively acquired Get With the Guidelines Stroke database from January 2003 to April 2008. All patients underwent clinical evaluation by a neurologist, diagnostic neuroimaging, and laboratory testing on admission. We classified patients with absolute contraindications to IV tPA as ineligible, and those with warnings/relative contraindications or potentially treatable factors as potentially eligible. RESULTS: Of 2,335 considered for analysis, 470 (20.1%) patients presented to our emergency department (ED) within 3 hours. Among these, 147 (31.3%) received IV tPA in our ED, 102 (21.7%) had an absolute contraindication, and 221 (47%) had a reason to consider withholding tPA. Only 30/470 (6.4%) of potential thrombolysis patients were discovered to have international normalized ratio &gt; or =1.7 or platelets &lt; or =100,000/microL, and of these, 28 were suspected a priori due to known coagulopathy from medication or illness. Only 2/470 (0.4%) patients had an unsuspected coagulopathy that ultimately prevented thrombolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experience of a large thrombolysis referral center, stroke patients without suspected clotting abnormality can safely begin thrombolytic therapy before clotting results are available. These data support the current practice guidelines, and may reassure clinicians that the benefits of early administration greatly outweigh the risks due to an unsuspected bleeding diathesis.",M2
19934446,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator deficiency attenuates peritoneal fibrosis in mice.Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is an important complication of peritoneal dialysis therapy. The present study was performed to examine the mechanisms of PF in view of the plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cascade. PF was induced in tissue-type PA (<e>tPA</e>) deficient mice and wild-type mice by intraperitoneal injection of chlorhexidine gluconate. Mice were killed on day 21, and tissue samples were taken. Histopathological studies were performed. Plasmin activity, gelatinases activity, and the levels of tPA, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and MMP-2 mRNA were determined. Protein levels of MMP-3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, -2, and -3, phospho-Smad3, membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP, and MT3-MMP were also studied. On day 21, tPA +/+ mice showed severe PF, whereas tPA -/- mice showed milder change. Submesothelial basement membranes were dissolved in tPA +/+ mice while they were relatively preserved in tPA -/- mice. The levels of macrophage infiltration, staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen type III, and vascular density were all significantly lower in tPA -/- mice than in tPA +/+ mice. The levels of plasmin activity, pro- and active MMP-2, mRNA expression of tPA and TGF-beta1, and phospho-Smad3 protein were also lower in tPA -/- mice. No difference was observed between the two groups concerning the protein levels of MMP-3, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, MT1-MMP, or MT3-MMP. These results indicate that the presence of tPA enhances inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrogenesis in the peritoneum of the PF model mice. Activation of the PA/plasmin/MMP cascade may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PF.",M2
19934371,"Delayed treatment with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decoys reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis.We examined the capacity of delayed inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to reduce tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in mice. Small peptides mimicking parts of urokinase (uPA) and tissular plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) and serving as decoy molecules for PAI-1 were administered daily during the late stages (3 to 8 days) of UUO. Treatment with PAI-1 decoys reduced interstitial deposition of fibronectin, collagen III and collagen IV without changes in macrophage and myofibroblast infiltration. Interestingly, while PAI-1 activity was reduced and the combined uPA and tPA activity was increased, the antifibrotic effect was obtained without modification of plasmin activity but with increased of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression. We show for the first time that treatment with small PAI-1 decoy peptides reduces established tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This protective effect probably resulted from increased degradation of the extracellular matrix by an HGF dependent mechanism.",M2
19934281,"Intrapleural hemorrhage after administration of <e>tPA</e>: a case report and review of the literature.OBJECTIVE: Intrapleural fibrinolytic enzymes have been used for over 60 years in the treatment of complicated pleural effusions to lyse loculations and promote resolution. Despite this extensive history of use, however, little is known about complications that may arise with the use of this therapy. Here we discuss a patient with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis who developed an intrapleural hemorrhage after the administration of intrapleural tPA to treat a complicated parapneumonic effusion. A review of the literature examines the efficacy and safety of this therapy, focusing on bleeding complications. Specific attention is paid to patients who have underlying coagulopathies or who are receiving anticoagulation. DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature, as indexed in PubMed, was undertaken using the following search terms in combination: tPA, pleural effusion, complications of thrombolytics, and intrapleural hemorrhage. The search was inclusive of patients under the age of 18, but was limited by English language and human subjects. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant articles identified during the search were reviewed. Those studies that reported on bleeding complications, or lack thereof, were included in this review. Limitations of each article are noted in the text. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple studies, including a 2000 ACP consensus statement and a 2008 Cochrane review, indicate the need for further investigations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrapleural thrombolytics for the treatment of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Limited studies specifically address bleeding complications, especially in subpopulations of patients receiving concurrent anticoagulant therapy.",M2
19931652,"Enhanced fibrinolysis by proteolysed coagulation factor Xa.We previously showed that coagulation factor Xa (FXa) enhances activation of the fibrinolysis zymogen plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>). Implying that proteolytic modulation occurs in situ, intact FXa (FXaalpha) must be sequentially cleaved by plasmin or autoproteolysis, producing FXabeta and Xa33/13, which acquire necessary plasminogen binding sites. The implicit function of Xa33/13 in plasmin generation has not been demonstrated, nor has FXaalpha/beta or Xa33/13 been studied in clot lysis experiments. We now report that purified Xa33/13 increases tPA-dependent plasmin generation by at least 10-fold. Western blots confirmed that in situ conversion of FXaalpha/beta to Xa33/13 correlated to enhanced plasmin generation. Chemical modification of the FXaalpha active site resulted in the proteolytic generation of a product distinct from Xa33/13 and inhibited the enhancement of plasminogen activation. Identical modification of Xa33/13 had no effect on tPA cofactor function. Due to its overwhelming concentration in the clot, fibrin is the accepted tPA cofactor. Nevertheless, at the functional level of tPA that circulates in plasma, FXaalpha/beta or Xa33/13 greatly reduced purified fibrin lysis times by as much as 7-fold. This effect was attenuated at high levels of tPA, suggesting a role when intrinsic plasmin generation is relatively low. FXaalpha/beta or Xa33/13 did not alter the apparent size of fibrin degradation products, but accelerated the initial cleavage of fibrin to fragment X, which is known to optimize the tPA cofactor activity of fibrin. Thus, coagulation FXaalpha undergoes proteolytic modulation to enhance fibrinolysis, possibly by priming the tPA cofactor function of fibrin.",M2
19929406,"Association of PAI-1 4G/5G and -844G/A gene polymorphisms and changes in PAI-1/tissue plasminogen activator levels in myocardial infarction: a case-control study.BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is induced by acquired and inherited risk factors, including the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) -844G/A and -675G/A (4G/5G) gene variants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PAI-1-844G/A and 4G/5G polymorphisms and changes in PAI-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) levels in MI in a Tunisian population. METHODS: This was a case-control study involving 305 patients with MI and 328 unrelated healthy controls. PAI-1 genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (-844G/A) or by polymerase chain reaction-allele specific amplification. PAI-1 and tPA levels were assayed by serological assays. RESULTS: In contrast to tPA levels, mean plasma PAI-1 antigen levels were higher in cases than in control subjects. The elevation in PAI-1 levels was more pronounced in -844A and 4G allele carriers. Significantly higher frequencies of (mutant) 4G and -844A alleles and 4G/4G and -844A/-844A genotypes, and corresponding lower frequencies of (wild-type) 5G and -844G alleles and 5G/5G and -844G/-844G genotypes were seen in patients than in controls. Increased prevalence of 4G/-844A and decreased prevalence of 5G/-844G haplotypes were seen in patients than in controls, thereby conferring a susceptibility and protective nature to these haplotypes, respectively. Regression analysis confirmed the independent association of 4G/4G and -844A/A with MI, after controlling for a number of covariates. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the risk of MI was notably high in 4G and -844A carriers with elevated plasma PAI-1 and were associated with reduced tPA levels.",M2
19927632,"[An angiographic trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase in Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction]OBJECTIVE: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter, angiographic trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase (TNK-<e>tPA</e>) with alteplase (rt-PA) in Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHOD: Patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pain to hospital time within 6 hours from October 2002, to March 2004 were randomly assigned a body weight-adjusted bolus of TNK-tPA (0.53 mg/kg over more than 10 s, n = 58) or front loaded rt-PA (&lt; or = 100 mg, n = 52). Coronary angiography was performed at 90 min after initiating study drugs. All patients received aspirin and heparin (target activated partial thromboplastin time: 50-70 s). The primary end point of the trial was the rate of TIMI grade 3 flow at 90 minutes. Other end points included the rate of TIMI grade 2/3 flow at 90 minutes, all cause mortality at 30 days, the moderate/severe hemorrhage without intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and ICH within 30 days. RESULTS: TIMI grade 3 flow at 90 minutes (68.4% vs. 66.7%, P = 1.00), TIMI grade 2 or 3 at 90 minutes (89.5% vs. 80.4%, P = 0.278), total mortality at 30 days (13.8% vs. 9.6%, P = 0.565), the rate of moderate/severe hemorrhage (8.6% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.72) and incidence of ICH (3.5% vs. 1.9%, P = 1.00) were all similar in TNK-tPA treated patients compared to rt-PA treated patients. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of single-bolus, weight-adjusted TNK-tPA fibrinolytic regimen is equivalent to front-loaded alteplase in terms of the rates of TIMI grade 3 flow, TIMI 2 or 3 flow. Incidences of moderate/severe hemorrhage, ICH and 30-days mortality were similar in TNK-tPA and rt-PA treated patients.",M2

In PE, maternal and UCB PlGF were significantly lower; maternal VEGF, sVEGFR-1 and tPA were significantly higher. In UCB, sVEGFR-1 and tPA were significantly higher in PEc cases, while VEGF and PlGF were significantly lower. A significant correlation between maternal and UCB sVEGFR-1, and between sVEGFR-1 and tPA both in maternal and UCB, was observed in PEc cases. In maternal and UCB circulation in PE, a close interaction seems to exist between endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis disturbance, and sVEGFR-1 seems to play a central role in those disturbances.",M2
19911010,"NR2D-containing NMDA receptors mediate tissue plasminogen activator-promoted neuronal excitotoxicity.Although the molecular bases of its actions remain debated, tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) is a paradoxical brain protease, as it favours some learning/memory processes, but increases excitotoxic neuronal death. Here, we show that, in cultured cortical neurons, tPA selectively promotes NR2D-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent activation. We show that tPA-mediated signalling and neurotoxicity through the NMDAR are blocked by co-application of an NR2D antagonist (phenanthrene derivative (2S(*), 3R(*))-1-(phenanthrene-2-carbonyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, PPDA) or knockdown of neuronal NR2D expression. In sharp contrast with cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons do not exhibit NR2D both in vitro and in vivo and are consequently resistant to tPA-promoted NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity. Moreover, we have shown that activation of synaptic NMDAR prevents further tPA-dependent NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity and sensitivity to PPDA. This study shows that the earlier described pro-neurotoxic effect of tPA is mediated by NR2D-containing NMDAR-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, a deleterious effect prevented by synaptic pre-activation.",M2
19910552,"Remote supervision of IV-<e>tPA</e> for acute ischemic stroke by telemedicine or telephone before transfer to a regional stroke center is feasible and safe.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because of a shortage of stroke specialists, many outlying or  spoke  hospitals initiate intravenous (IV) thrombolysis using telemedicine or telephone consultation before transferring patients to a regional stroke center (RSC) hub. We analyzed complications and outcomes of patients treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using the  drip and ship  approach compared to those treated directly at the RSC. METHODS: A retrospective review of our Get With the Guidelines Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) database from 01/2003 to 03/2008 identified 296 patients who received IV tPA within 3 hours of symptom onset without catheter-based reperfusion. GWTG-Stroke definitions for symptomatic intracranial (sICH), systemic hemorrhage, discharge functional status, and destination were applied. Follow-up modified Rankin Score was recorded when available. RESULTS: Of 296 patients, 181 (61.1%) had tPA infusion started at an outside spoke hospital (OSH) and 115 (38.9%) at the RSC hub. OSH patients were younger with fewer severe strokes than RSC patients. Patients treated based on telestroke were more frequently octogenarians than patients treated based on a telephone consult. Mortality, sICH, and functional outcomes were not different between OSH versus RSC and telephone versus telestroke patients. Among survivors, mean length of stay was shorter for OSH patients but discharge status was similar and 75% of patients walked independently at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in OSH  drip and ship  patients treated in a hub-and-spoke network were comparable to those treated directly at an RSC. These data suggest that  drip and ship  is a safe and effective method to shorten time to treatment with IV tPA.",M2
19899982,"Inhibitory effect on LPS-induced retinal microglial activation of downregulation of t-PA expression by siRNA interference.PURPOSE: This study investigated the expression and release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced retinal microglia activation. We evaluated change in microglia activation following down-regulation of t-PA expression by siRNA interference. METHODS: The primary cultured microglia cells were isolated from retinas of S-D rats and activated with different concentration of LPS (0, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 ng/ml). Double immunofluorescence (OX42 and <e>tPA</e>) and Western blot were used to detect t-PA expression. Next, tPA expression was down-regulated by siRNA interference, the microglia transfected with tPA siRNA lentivirus or blank control lentivirus were activated with 30 ng/ml of LPS, the culture supernatant was collected 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS treatment for IL-1beta and TNF-alpha ELISA assays, and the cells were collected 24 hours later for immunocytochemistry of microglia markers (OX42 and Iba-1) and quantitative real-time PCR to determine the inhibitory efficiency of t-PA siRNA. Transfection efficiency was evaluated with flow cytometry by EGFP expression. RESULTS: The microglia expressed t-PA when treated with LPS in a dose-dependent pattern. The expression was down-regulated by siRNA interference markedly; the inhibitory efficiency was 80% as determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Transfection efficiency during siRNA interference was 88%. The expression of Iba-1 and the release of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were inhibited significantly when the t-PA expression was knocked down. CONCLUSIONS: Activated microglia express t-PA. Down-regulation of t-PA expression can inhibit the activation of microglial cell.",M2
19893313,"Transient ischemic attack after tissue plasminogen activator: aborted stroke or unnecessary stroke therapy?BACKGROUND: The frequency with which intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke results in normal clinical and radiographic status is currently unknown. METHODS: Patients who received intravenous thrombolysis at community hospitals and a stroke center were retrospectively analyzed for occurrence of normal imaging after tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) treatment. The cases were classified as nonischemic process (stroke mimic), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke. The occurrence rate and predictors of each condition were sought. RESULTS: Of 254 patients who received tPA, 9 (3.5%) had a nonischemic process, 23 (9.1%) had TIA, and 222 (87%) were diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Nonischemic process patients were younger and were more likely to have received tPA at a community hospital than those with TIA or stroke. TIA was associated with lower pretreatment serum glucose, prevalence of coronary artery disease and stroke severity but not to time to treatment. CONCLUSION: Over 10% of patients who receive tPA for cerebral ischemia do not develop ischemic injury. tPA use for a nonischemic process is infrequent but is associated with community hospital use.",M2
19893312,"Day-90 acute ischemic stroke outcomes can be derived from early functional activity level.BACKGROUND: The time point generally recognized as most appropriate to assess final functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke is 3 months. However, identifying earlier reliable prognostic time points may allay patient anxiety about the recovery process, enable assignment of outcome in patients lost to follow-up, and provide earlier and more readily available options for clinical outcome assessment in adaptive design and proof of concept studies. We assessed whether day-7/10 functional outcome predicted day-90 functional outcome among acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: The NINDS-<e>tPA</e> Study database was analyzed. Global disability was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Spearman correlation evaluated the association of day-7/10 versus day-90 mRS, and observed agreement was computed using the weighted kappa agreement, both unadjusted and adjusted by multivariable ordinal logistic modeling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence stroke outcomes. RESULTS: 581 subjects (93%) were alive at 7-10 days. There was strong correlation between mRS score at day 7/10 and day 90 (r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.0001), and the weighted kappa agreement was 0.82 (p &lt; 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, day-7/10 day mRS was independently and strongly associated with day-90 mRS, while among other baseline variables, only baseline NIH Stroke Scale score (per unit increase) and a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) were significantly associated with a worse day-90 mRS. CONCLUSIONS: Global disability status 1 week after an index ischemic stroke strongly predicts final 3-month disability outcome. Functioning at 1 week, supplemented by initial stroke severity and CHF history information, may provide an early outcome guide useful for patient and family counseling.",M2
19893307,"Baseline diabetic status and admission blood glucose were poor prognostic factors in the EPITHET trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data have suggested that diabetes and hyperglycemia predict poor outcome following stroke. We studied the prognostic impact of diabetes and admission blood glucose in the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET). METHODS: EPITHET was a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) in the 3- to 6-hour time window. A preexisting diagnosis of diabetes was noted and baseline serum glucose was measured. RESULTS: Intravenous tPA attenuated infarct growth in non-diabetics, but not in diabetics (p = 0.029). In the tPA treatment group, admission blood glucose was higher among patients with poor functional outcome (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and hyperglycemia attenuate the effects of tPA on infarct evolution. Future thrombolytic trials should consider randomizing patients by subgroups based on diabetic status and serum glucose levels.",M2
19891959,"Efficacy and safety profile of the carotenoid trans sodium crocetinate administered to rabbits following multiple infarct ischemic strokes: a combination therapy study with tissue plasminogen activator.Trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) is a synthetic small-molecule antioxidant that has the ability to enhance oxygen diffusion to hypoxic tissue. Because TSC is a promising drug candidate to treat acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we tested the hypothesis that TSC may be neuroprotective following cerebral ischemia using a rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM) using clinical rating scores as the endpoint. TSC or saline was administered IV following the injection of small blood clots into the brain vasculature. Behavior was measured 24 h following embolization in order to calculate the effective stroke dose (P(50)) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. A treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared to control. TSC (0.25 mg/kg) given 5 or 60 min following embolization significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased P(50) values by 104% and 181%; but not when given 3 h post-embolization (48% increase, p&gt;0.05). <e>tPA</e> (3.3 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in P(50) when given 1, but not 3 h following embolization. In combination studies, when TSC was administered 1 h and tPA was given either 1 or 3 h following embolization, the group P(50) values were increased by 291% and 140%, respectively. In addition, TSC plus tPA administered 3 h following embolization significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the group P(50) value by 90%. There were no significant effects (p&gt;0.05) of either TSC alone or TSC administered in combination with tPA on intracerebral hemorrhage incidence. This study suggests that TSC may be used for the treatment of AIS either alone or when administered before or concomitant with tPA to improve clinical rating scores with a therapeutic window for TSC therapy up to 3 h in rabbits. Moreover, it appears that TSC can be administered with tPA, since the combination did not result in any significant change in intracerebral hemorrhage incidence.",M2
19879780,"Long-term results using catheter-directed thrombolysis in 103 lower limbs with acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis.OBJECTIVES: The long-term outcome of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in patients with acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis (IFVT) is evaluated in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients presenting for treatment with IFVT between June 1999 and May 2007 were considered for treatment using CDT. The following inclusion criteria were used: first episode of IFVT, age below 60 years, age of thrombus &lt;14 days and open distal popliteal vein. Ultrasonography (US) was used to verify the diagnosis. The popliteal vein was punctured under local anaesthesia using US guidance, and a multi-side-hole catheter with tip occlusion was placed in the thrombus. A solution of r-<e>TPA</e> was infused either continuously or using the pulse spray technique together with heparin. Any occlusion or residual stenosis in the iliac vein system was treated by stenting. Compression stockings and anticoagulation treatment were given for at least 12 months. Patients with severe thrombophilias were treated for longer periods. The patients were assessed by colour-duplex US for assessment of patency and valve function after 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months and afterwards on a yearly basis. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with 103 extremities affected by iliofemoral venous thrombosis were included (median age; 29 years, 78 women, and 79 had left-sided thrombosis). A stent was inserted in 57 limbs. The median follow-up time was 50 months (range 3 days-108 months). At 6 years, 82% of the limbs had patent veins with competent valves and without any skin changes or venous claudication. CONCLUSION: Treatment with CDT for IFVT achieves good patency and vein function after 6 years of follow-up in this highly selected group of patients. We suggest that results from future studies should be presented as Kaplan-Meier plots using venous patency without reflux as the main outcome, since it is an early indicator of the clinical outcome.",M2
19879371,"Safety of prolonged, repeated administration of a pulmonary formulation of tissue plasminogen activator in mice.BACKGROUND: Disruption of fibrinolytic homeostasis participates in the pathogenesis of severe lung diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and plastic bronchitis. We have developed a pulmonary formulation of tissue plasminogen activator (pf-<e>tPA</e>) that withstands nebulization and reaches the lower airways. OBJECTIVE: Since treatment of ARDS, IPF and plastic bronchitis will require repeated administration of pf-tPA, the purpose of this study was to determine the safety of prolonged, repeated administration of pf-mouse tPA (pf-mtPA) to the lungs of healthy mice. METHODS: Male and female B6C3F1 mice received one of two intratracheal (IT) doses of either nebulized pf-mtPA or sterile saline twice daily for 28 days. Weekly blood samples were collected to estimate hematocrit. Following the dosing period, animals were sacrificed for gross necropsy, the acquisition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and histological assessment of the lungs and other major organs. RESULTS: The low dose of pf-mtPA was well tolerated by both female and male mice. However, female and male mice that received the high dose experienced a 16% and 8% incidence, respectively, of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Although male mice had a lower incidence of bleeding, these events occurred at lower mean (+/-S.E.) doses (1.06+/-0.02mg/kg/d) of pf-mtPA compared with females (1.48+/-0.03mg/kg/d, p&lt;0.001). In addition, male mice had higher BALF mtPA concentrations. Bleeding occurred six and 12 days in male and female mice, respectively, after the initiation of dosing suggesting that mtPA accumulated in the lungs. CONCLUSION: This study established a safe dose range and demonstrated the feasibility of prolonged, repeated dosing of pf-tPA. High doses (&gt; or =1mg/kg/d) were associated with pulmonary hemorrhage that may be due, in part, to accumulation of drug in the lungs.",M2
19866410,"Evaluation of a possible inflammatory response after appendectomy for non-perforated appendicitis in children.BACKGROUND: The inflammatory process in the post-appendectomy period is not well characterized. In a pilot study, we prospectively followed the kinetics of different inflammatory mediators before and after appendectomy in children, and compared the results of the groups open appendectomy (OA) and laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Levels of sP-selectin, <e>tPA</e>, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, sVCAM-1, and sCD40L were measured before appendectomy and on the next three consecutive days in the serum of 25 children (16 males and 9 females) aged 7 - 16 years (mean 12.6+/-2.47 years) with non-perforated acute appendicitis. RESULTS: LA and OA were performed in 16 and 9 patients respectively. None of the markers of inflammation differed significantly by surgical approach at any point of observation. However, sP-selectin, MCP-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were found to have significantly different postoperative kinetics with a trend towards higher values in the laparoscopic group compared to the open appendectomy group (p=0.034, p=0.016 and p=0.025, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The cytokines sP-selectin, MCP-1 and sVCAM-1 may play a role in the possible post-appendectomy cytokine activation after non-perforated appendicitis. Since this phenomenon is more evident after LA than after OA, the contribution of the different LA procedures has to be further investigated.",M2

19845466,"Endothelial progenitor populations in differentiating embryonic stem cells. II. Drug selection and functional characterization.Despite the enormous potential of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for use in tissue engineering and cell therapies, clinical use of ESCs has been deterred by difficulties in obtaining desired cell populations without undifferentiated or other undesired cell phenotypes. Previously we demonstrated the time-dependent variation of endothelial specific promoter activities in differentiating mouse ESCs. Here, we evaluated the functional behavior of endothelial cells (ECs) selected using a drug resistance gene (Puro(R)) under the control of different EC promoters (Flk1, Tie1, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), as well as vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin). All four promoters tested yielded cells with EC-specific protein expression and acetylated low density lipoprotein, labeled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-Ac-LDL) uptake after puromycin treatment. However, the percentage of puromycin-surviving cells varied depending on EC promoters, indicating different levels of promoter activity. Continuous selection of ECs in puromycin reduced the presence of smooth muscle cells or undifferentiated cells. Puro-selected cells under all the EC promoters were positive for capillary-like network formation in Matrigel. Prostacyclin secretion by ESC-derived ECs showed improvement with orbital shear stress exposure corresponding to 0-16 dynes/cm(2); however, prostacyclin levels were lower than those seen in immortalized mouse EC lines. Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) secretion by Puro-selected cells was comparable to that seen in cell lines, but tPA secretion after shear stress exposure showed mixed results, with tPA increasing upon shear under PECAM and Tie1 promoters and tPA decreasing upon shear under Flk1 and VE-cadherin promoters.",M2
19844097,"Safety and efficacy of IV-<e>TPA</e> for ischaemic stroke in clinical practice--a Bayesian analysis.BACKGROUND: Observational studies of new treatments in routine practice are clinically important but may be limited by bias. We used a Bayesian approach to interpret and sequentially combine phase 4 studies of IV-TPA within 3 h for acute ischaemic stroke to quantify the cumulative evidence for the efficacy and safety of this therapy in clinical practice. METHODS: Prior probability distributions for favourable outcome (modified Rankin Score, mRS, 0-1), symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, and mortality 3 months after IV-TPA were derived from the NINDS trial. Phase 4 studies from observational case series and from regulator-mandated large registries were included. A cumulative analysis was performed to quantify the increase in the total evidence base over time, unadjusted and adjusted for potential bias. RESULTS: The cumulative analysis indicated that IV-TPA &lt;3 h was associated with 3-month favourable outcome in 37.1% (95% credible interval, CrI, 36.1-38.0%, n = 9,578) compared to 26% (95% confidence interval, CI, 19.6-32.9%, n = 165) in placebo-treated patients in NINDS, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in 6.6% (95% CrI 5.9-7.4%, n = 10, 834) compared to 6.4% (95% CI 4.0-9.4%) in the NINDS IV-TPA group, and 3-month mortality in 13.6% (95% CrI 12.6-14.8%, n = 9, 901) compared to 20.5% (95% CI 16.0-25.0%, n = 312) in the NINDS placebo group. CONCLUSION: A Bayesian approach provides further confirmatory evidence of the efficacy and safety of IV-TPA for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke within 3 h in diverse clinical practice settings, after adjusting for potential observational bias.",M2
19834397,"Safety, effectiveness, and practicality of endovascular therapy within the first 3 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset.OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the safety, effectiveness, and practicality of endovascular therapy for ischemic stroke within the first 3 hours of symptom onset. METHODS: A retrospective chart review (January 2000-July 2008) was performed of 94 consecutive patients who had endovascular therapy within 3 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset. Endovascular therapy was administered in patients in whom intravenous (IV) thrombolysis failed or was contraindicated. Outcome measures analyzed were recanalization rate, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rate, procedural complications, modified Rankin Scale score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and mortality rate. RESULTS: The study included 41 male and 53 female patients with a mean age of 68 years (age range, 13-98 years). The mean NIHSS score at the time of admission was 14.7. Eight-three patients had anterior circulation ischemic events, and 11 had posterior circulation ischemic events. The cause was determined to be arterioembolic in 21 patients (22%), cardioembolic in 45 (48%), arterial dissection in 2, left-to-right cardiac shunt in 1, and unknown in 25 (27%). Endovascular interventions included intra-arterial (IA) pharmacological thrombolysis (n = 44), mechanical thrombolysis (Merci Retrieval System, intracranial or extracranial stent, microwire) (n = 79), and intracranial or extracranial angioplasty (n = 32) in various combinations. The mean time from stroke onset to angiogram was 72 minutes. Thirteen patients received a half dose (n = 8) or full dose (n = 5) of IV thrombolysis (tissue plasminogen activator [<e>tPA</e>]) in conjunction with endovascular therapy. Twenty-two patients received IA or IV adjunctive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide). Partial-to-complete recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction scale score of 2 or 3) was achieved in 62 of 89 of patients (70%) presenting with significant occlusion (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction scale score of 0 or 1). Postprocedure symptomatic ICH occurred in 5 patients (5.3%), which was purely subarachnoid hemorrhage in 3 patients. Of these, 2 received IA tPA in conjunction with Merci Retrieval System passes; the others each received IA tPA, mechanical thrombectomy (guidewire), or extracranial angioplasty. The total mortality rate including procedural mortality, progression of disease, and other comorbidities was 26.6%. Sixteen patients (17%) were discharged home, 49 (52%) to rehabilitation, and 4 (4%) to long-term care facilities. Overall, 36.7% had a modified Rankin Scale score of 2 or less at discharge. The mean NIHSS score at discharge was 6.5, representing an overall 8-point improvement on the NIHSS. CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy within the first 3 hours of stroke symptom onset in patients in whom IV tPA therapy is contraindicated or fails is safe, effective, and practical. The risk of symptomatic ICH is low and should be viewed relative to the poor prognosis in this group of patients.",M2
19825910,"Effects of atenolol or losartan on fibrinolysis and von Willebrand factor in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of the beta-blocker atenolol with the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan on plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) activity and mass concentration, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, tPA/PAI-1 complex, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). DESIGN: A prespecified, explorative substudy in 22 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) performed within randomized multicenter, double-blind prospective study. RESULTS: After a median of 36 weeks of treatment, there were significant differences between the treatment groups, atenolol versus losartan, in plasma median levels of tPA mass (11.9 vs 7.3 ng/mL, P = .019), PAI-1 activity (20.7 vs 4.8 IU/mL, P = .030), and tPA/PAI-1 complex (7.1 vs 2.5 ng/mL, P = .015). In patients treated with atenolol, median levels of tPA mass (8.9-11.9 ng/mL, P = .021) and VWF (113.5%-134.3%, P = .021) increased significantly, indicating a change toward a more prothrombotic state. No significant changes occurred in the losartan group. CONCLUSION: Losartan treatment was associated with preserved fibrinolytic balance compared to a more prothrombotic fibrinolytic and hemostatic state in the atenolol group. These findings suggest different fibrinolytic and hemostatic responses to treatment in hypertensive patients with LVH.",M2

The charts of all patients treated with r-tPa for acute stroke at two centers in Pakistan (Aga Khan University, Karachi and Liaquat National hospital, Karachi) were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 21 patients. The utilization of tPa at Aga Khan Hospital was 18/1,185 patients (1.5%) from 2005 to 2007 while at Liaquat National Hospital was 3/575 patients (0.52%) over 1 year (2007). Mean time interval between stroke onset and start of r-tPa infusion was 169 min. Three patients (14%) developed fatal hemorrhage and two (10%) developed non-fatal hemorrhage. Four patients (19%) died. We identified protocol violations in seven patients (33%). In conclusion, the utilization of thrombolytic therapy is low and complication rate is high. Interventions for training physicians are needed.",M2
19811533,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator-plasmin-BDNF modulate glutamate-induced phase-shifts of the mouse suprachiasmatic circadian clock in vitro.The mammalian circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) maintains environmental synchrony through light signals transmitted by glutamate released from retinal ganglion terminals. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is required for light/glutamate to reset the clock. In the hippocampus, BDNF is activated by the extracellular protease, plasmin, which is produced from plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>). We provide data showing expression of proteins from the plasminogen activation cascade in the SCN and their involvement in circadian clock phase-resetting. Early night glutamate application to SCN-containing brain slices resets the circadian clock. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) blocked these shifts in slices from wild-type mice but not mice lacking its stabilizing protein, vitronectin (VN). Plasmin, but not plasminogen, prevented inhibition by PAI-1. Both plasmin and active BDNF reversed alpha(2)-antiplasmin inhibition of glutamate-induced shifts. alpha(2)-Antiplasmin decreased the conversion of inactive to active BDNF in the SCN. Finally, both tPA and BDNF allowed daytime glutamate-induced phase-resetting. Together, these data are the first to demonstrate expression of these proteases in the SCN, their involvement in modulating photic phase-shifts, and their activation of BDNF in the SCN, a potential 'gating' mechanism for photic phase-resetting. These data also demonstrate a functional interaction between PAI-1 and VN in adult brain. Given the usual association of these proteins with the extracellular matrix, these data suggest new lines of investigation into the locations and processes modulating mammalian circadian clock phase-resetting.",M2
19809208,"Procoagulant state in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.The impact of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on activated hemostasis is still unclear. We sought to compare the activation of hemostasis in patients with heart failure with preserved LVEF, with impaired LVEF, and in healthy controls. Biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis (D-dimer, <e>tPA</e> and PAI-1) were determined in outpatients with chronic stable (NYHA I-III), optimally managed heart failure with preserved LVEF (n = 46) and with impaired LVEF (n = 52), and in healthy age- and gender-matched controls (n = 14). In comparison to healthy controls, patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF had increased median D-dimer levels (606 [330-1222] microg/L versus 174 [86-249] microg/L; P &lt; 0.001), and median PAI-1 (20 [15.3-33.1] microg versus 6.2[3.4-8.9] microg/L; P &lt; 0.001) and tPA antigen concentrations (9.6 [8.1-13.3] versus 3.6 [2.2-5.0] microg/L; P &lt; 0.001). However, unlike tPA and PAI antigens, D-dimer levels in preserved LVEF did not reach values as high as in impaired LVEF (917 [454-1185] microg/L; P = 0.013). Moreover, in patients with impaired LVEF, but not in those with preserved LVEF, age and NT-proBNP emerged as independent predictors of log-transformed D-dimer levels. Heart failure with preserved LVEF is associated with a procoagulant state as determined by increased levels of D-dimer, tPA and PAI-1 antigens. D-dimer levels are significantly higher in patients with impaired LVEF, while tPA and PAI-1 levels are increased regardless of LVEF.",M2

19782528,"Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis: an alternative in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis.OBJECTIVE: Venous lysis is usually reserved for symptomatic patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and low risk for bleeding. This study reports the use of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients with symptomatic DVT treated between 2007 and 2008 with PMT was performed. All patients were treated by a combination of local tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) with the Angiojet (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) or Trellis device (Bacchus Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif). Catheter-directed lysis was used sparingly. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (mean age, 48.4 +/- 16.6 years) presented with symptoms averaging 13.6 +/- 9.6 days in duration. Nineteen (44%) had symptoms for &gt;14 days, and 15 (35%) had a high risk for bleeding. Symptomatic subclavian thrombosis occurred in eight (19%), and 35 (81%) presented with disabling lower extremity DVT (4 phlegmasia) despite anticoagulation. Fifteen patients had a thrombosed indwelling permanent filter. Sixty-three percent were treated in one session, but 16 patients required a lytic infusion after suboptimal PMT. Iliac stenting was required in 35% of limbs treated. Successful lysis (&gt;50%) was achieved in 95% of patients and symptom resolution in 93%. All patients became ambulatory with no or minimal limitation. There were no major systemic bleeding complications, but access site hematoma occurred in two patients and worsening of pre-existing rectus sheath hematoma requiring transfusion occurred in another two. Limb salvage was maintained in 100% of patients who presented with phlegmasia. Mean follow-up was 5.0 +/- 4.8 months. Freedom from DVT recurrence and reintervention was 95% at 9 months by life-table analysis. CONCLUSIONS: PMT can be safely and effectively used for subacute iliocaval and iliofemoral DVT and in patients with contraindications for lytic therapy, resulting in improved functional outcomes relative to their debilitated state before the procedure.",M2
19781532,"The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin reduces thrombolytic-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in embolized rabbits.Statins were designed as cholesterol-lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary artery disease. It is estimated that there are currently 33.5 million U.S. patients on chronic statin treatment regimens. Recently, statins have been shown to have pleiotropic including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of simvastatin administered alone and in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) on measures of ischemia and hemorrhage in large clot embolized New Zealand white rabbits. For these studies, simvastatin (20 mg/kg, SC in DMSO) was administered 24 and 4 h prior to large clot embolization in order to achieve a  loading dose  pretreatment with the drug. In combination studies, tPA (3.3 mg/kg, IV) was administered 1 h following embolization. Intravenous tPA administration significantly increased hemorrhage volume by 175% (p=0.015) and hemorrhage incidence by 60% (p&gt;0.05) compared to control, but did not affect infarct incidence or volume. Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased tPA-induced hemorrhage incidence (p=0.022) and volume (p=0.0001) following embolization. The study suggests that simvastatin treatment blocks or attenuates mechanisms involved in tPA-induced hemorrhage. Based upon our results, patients on simvastatin treatment may have significantly reduced tPA-induced side effects should they require tPA administration following an embolic stroke.",M2
19775424,"The economics of treating stroke as an acute brain attack.Currently, treatments for ischemic stroke focus on restoring or improving perfusion to the ischemic area using thrombolytics. The increased hospitalization costs related to thrombolysis are offset by a decrease in rehabilitation costs, for a net cost savings to the healthcare system. However, early treatment is essential. The benefit of thrombolysis is time-dependent but only a very small proportion of patients, 2%, are presently being treated with <e>tPA</e>. In the United States, if the proportion of all ischemic stroke patients that receive tPA were increased to 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, or 20%, the realized cost saving would be approximately $ 15, 22, 30, 37, 55, and 74 million, respectively. Being so, efforts should be made to educate the public and paramedics regarding early stroke signs. Furthermore, additional acute stroke therapy training programs need to be established for emergency departments. Finally, hospital systems need to be re-engineered to treat patients as quickly as possible in order to optimize thrombolytic benefit as well as maximize cost-effectiveness.",M2
19766603,"Long-term functional and neurological outcome after simultaneous treatment with tissue-plasminogen activator and hyperbaric oxygen in early phase of embolic stroke in rats.The combination of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) is of interest in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with a view to combine positive effects of both strategies. We investigated neurological and functional outcome after early treatment with HBO additional to tPA in ischemic stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using an embolic stroke model in 87 male Wistar rats. Animals were randomized to therapy with tPA+HBO, tPA alone, or control. Menzies score, Beam walk, and the Corner test were assessed for a period of 4 weeks following ischemia. Within the first 24 h neurological deficits improved in all groups but most pronounced in animals treated with tPA+HBO. Thereafter, a deterioration of neurological deficits occurred in the tPA+HBO group with significant differences at day 7, 8, 18, and 24 (P&lt;0.05). Surprisingly, Beam walk and Corner test results did not differ significantly between all groups. This first report of early simultaneous treatment with tPA and HBO in experimental embolic stroke with 4-week follow-up confirms previous studies reporting positive effects of HBO shortly after the ischemia. Following the acute phase, combined tPA and HBO resulted in deterioration of neurological deficits without affecting functional recovery. Future studies should focus on interactions of tPA and HBO on molecular level leading to delayed damage to brain tissue at risk.",M2
19765940,"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for stroke: a review of the ECASS III results in relation to prior clinical trials.BACKGROUND: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV <e>tPA</e>) is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in acute ischemic stroke patients up to 3 h from symptom onset, based primarily on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke tPA trials published in 1995. The most recent trial published with IV tPA in stroke (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study [ECASS] III) studied patients between 3 and 4.5 h from symptom onset and found a benefit to treatment in the rate of favorable outcome when compared to placebo, with no difference in mortality. OBJECTIVES: To examine the patient selection criteria and primary outcomes in ECASS III as compared to prior clinical trials and the current practice in the United States to determine how these new data could be applied to clinical practice. DISCUSSION: With the exception of the longer time from symptom onset to treatment, ECASS III used more restrictive patient selection criteria than is the current practice in the United States to determine patient eligibility for IV tPA. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the combined data from all trials, the benefits of thrombolysis with IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke outweigh the risks of treatment for selected patients up to 4.5 h from symptom onset. It is already known that thrombolysis is not beneficial for all stroke patients and strict criteria should be applied before treatment. As time from symptom onset increases, the need for careful patient selection likely also increases.",M2
19765119,"Pre admission antithrombotics are associated with improved outcomes following ischaemic stroke: a cohort from the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network.BACKGROUND: Several studies have attempted to identify predictors of outcome following ischaemic stroke. Reduced stroke severity has been reported with pre admission ASA use, and improved outcomes have been reported with pre admission statin treatment. The interaction between pre treatment medications and clinical response to <e>tPA</e> is less clear. The objective of our study was to assess clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke with respect to pre treatment medications. METHODS: The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network collected pre morbid and prospective outcome data on 5568 patients with ischaemic stroke. We applied multivariate analyses to correlate pre admission medications with stroke severity on presentation, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin at discharge. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, medical history, tPA administration, blood pressure, and glucose on presentation. RESULTS: Pre admission treatment with ASA and clopidogrel was associated with less severe stroke upon presentation. A similar trend was seen with dipyridamole and ticlopidine, but did not reach statistical significance. Pre treatment with ASA and warfarin was associated with improved Rankin scores at discharge. There was no interaction between tPA treatment and pre admission antiplatelets with respect to in-hospital mortality or disability at discharge, although tPA treatment was independently associated with improved Rankin at discharge. Pre treatment antiplatelet use did not result in increased intracerebral haemorrhage following tPA administration. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute ischaemic stroke taking antithrombotic medications at hospital admission have improved functional outcomes. No interaction is noted between use of these medications and outcome following thrombolysis. This large prospective cohort study is consistent with previous published reports, and supports the notion that pre admission antithrombotics may mitigate brain injury during acute stroke.",M2
19762906,"Thrombolysis targeting MRI defined tissue at risk in minor stroke.BACKGROUND: Treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-<e>tPA</e>) is usually not recommended in patients with minor stroke. Clinical and imaging outcome were studied after IV-tPA treatment based on MRI criteria in patients with minor stroke. METHODS: Data were analysed retrospectively of acute ischaemic stroke patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &lt;4). All patients were studied by stroke MRI including perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging (PWI and DWI) and treated with IV-tPA for &lt; or =6 h. Final infarct volume was delineated on follow-up MRI. Clinical outcome was assessed after 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: Six patients with a median NIHSS on admission of 2 (range 0-3) were treated with IV-tPA based on MRI criteria. In all patients, occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was detected (MCA branch n = 2, MCA trunk n = 3, MCA trifurcation n = 1), and the PWI lesion (41, 25-60 ml) exceeded the DWI lesion (4, 1-23 ml). Final infarct volume was 9 (2-29) ml. Favourable outcome (mRS 0-1) was seen in 5/6 patients and independent outcome (mRS = 2) in one patient. No intracerebral haemorrhages occurred. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IV-tPA based on MRI criteria was safe and appeared to be effective in this small series of patients with minor stroke.",M2
19762071,"Effects of carvedilol or metoprolol on PAI-1, <e>tPA</e>-mass concentration or Von Willebrand factor in chronic heart failure--a COMET substudy.INTRODUCTION: In COMET (Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial), carvedilol reduced mortality compared with metoprolol in patients with chronic heart failure. We hypothesized that carvedilol might have greater effects on endothelial derived haemostatic factors than metoprolol. We aimed to study the effects of carvedilol or metoprolol on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), its inhibitor PAI-1 and Von Willebrand factor (VWF) in patients with heart failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 260 patients (134 on carvedilol, 126 on metoprolol), mean age 66 years and 84% of them men. Plasma mass concentrations of tPA and PAI-1and percent of VWF were measured at baseline and after one and two years of treatment. RESULTS: Plasma tPA, PAI-1 and VWF were similar between treatment groups at baseline and no significant differences between groups emerged after one or two years of treatment. In paired analyses in patients assigned to carvedilol, median PAI-1 level decreased from 37.2 to 32.1 microg/l at two years (p=0.034) and of VWF decreased from baseline to one year (240 vs. 218%, p=0.023) in patients assigned to carvedilol but were not reduced at any time in patients assigned to metoprolol. Plasma tPA increased over time in both treatment groups (p=0.013 and 0.027 respectively). CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in the effects of carvedilol or metoprolol on tPA, PAI-1 and VWF. Comparison over time within treatment groups suggested that PAI-1 and VWF might have declined on carvedilol but not on metoprolol. Our hypothesis is not proved but this may reflect an inadequate sample size rather than lack of an effect.",M2
19740689,"Prospective evaluation of tissue plasminogen activator in 11 cats with arterial thromboembolism.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical response and side effects of tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) for the treatment of feline arterial thromboembolism (ATE). Previous reports of conservative and thrombolytic therapy were used to provide a historical control group of cats with ATE. The study was terminated due to a high frequency of adverse outcomes. tPA was administered to 11 cats with clinical signs of ATE for a median duration of 4.0 h (range 2-12h) prior to treatment. Pulses were restored in 40% of limbs within 4h and 53% within 24h. Motor function was restored to 33% of limbs within 24h. Adverse effects were seen in 11/11 cats following administration of tPA including azotemia (n=5), neurological signs (n=5), cardiac arrhythmias (n=5), hyperkalemia (n=4), acidosis (n=2) and sudden death in one cat. Ultimately, three cats (27%) were discharged alive from the hospital. While signs compatible with thrombolysis were noted in many cats following tPA administration, a high rate of side effects and low rate of hospital discharge were noted in this study.",M2
19738172,"Reperfusion after stroke sonothrombolysis with microbubbles may predict intracranial bleeding.BACKGROUND: Although ultrasound-activated microbubbles (MB) accelerate clot lysis, MB activation has shown to promote blood barrier disruption and bleeding in animal models. We conducted a case-control study aimed to investigate the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after MB-enhanced sonothrombolysis in acute stroke. METHODS: We evaluated a total of 296 patients with acute stroke treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) &lt;3 hours after stroke onset. One hundred eighty-eight patients received continuous 2-hour TCD monitoring plus 3 doses of 2.5 g of MB after tPA bolus (MB group). These patients were compared with 98 historic stroke patients (control group). The presence and extent of HT on 24-hour CT were blindly assessed. RESULTS: Recanalization rates were higher in the MB compared with the control group at 1, 2, 6, and 12 hours (p &lt; 0.05). MB administration was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic infarction (HI)1-HI2 (21% vs 12%, p = 0.026) and a higher degree of clinical improvement at 24 hours (54.9% vs 31.1%, p = 0.004). Parenchymal hematoma (PH)1-PH2 and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were similar in both groups. Moreover, the extent of bleeding after MB-enhanced sonothrombolysis was correlated with the time to reperfusion. Early (&lt;6 hours) recanalization independently predicted HI in the MB group (odds ratio 6.3, 95% confidence interval 2.3-56) but not in the control group. Delayed (&gt;6 hours) or no recanalization was associated with PH1-PH2 in both the MB group (p = 0.024) and the control group (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: This hypothesis-generating study shows that microbubble administration was associated with early recanalization and a high rate of hemorrhagic transformation but does not seem to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. However, definitive conclusions cannot be made based on these data.",M2
19734765,"Comparison of surgical treatments for central retinal vein occlusion; RON vs. cannulation of tissue plasminogen activator into the retinal vein.PURPOSE: To compare the surgical outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of two treatments for central retinal vein occlusion: radial optic neurotomy (RON) and cannulation of tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) into the retinal vein (tPA). METHODS: This study consisted of 22 eyes. The inclusion criterion was a best-corrected visual acuity of &lt; or =20/60 due to central retinal vein occlusion. The exclusion criteria were previous treatment and the presence of ocular neovascularization. Patients were randomized into RON or tPA groups (n = 11 each). Best-corrected visual acuity, macular thickness, and complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean best-corrected visual acuity changed from 16/200 at baseline to 20/167 at 12 months in RON (P = 0.217) and from 10/200 to 20/200 in tPA (P = 0.051). The preoperative macular thicknesses decreased from 1,059 microm to 406 microm 12 months postoperatively in RON (P &lt; 0.001) and from 1,121 microm to 271 microm (P &lt; 0.001) in tPA. Neovascular glaucoma developed in 2 eyes (18%) in RON and in 4 eyes (40%) in tPA. Visual field defects associated with surgery were seen in 2 eyes (18%) in RON. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in surgical outcomes between the two procedures. Although best-corrected visual acuity and macular edema improved, the incidence of neovascular glaucoma was high. It is, therefore, still uncertain whether these treatments are effective.",M2
19707983,"Effect of ACE inhibition on the fibrinolytic system in patients requiring coronary artery bypass grafting.BACKGROUND: Regulation of the fibrinolytic balance between plasminogen activators and inhibitors is modulated by the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, alterations in the renin-angiotensin system by ACE inhibitors probably result in modification of the fibrinolytic system. We examined the effect of a short-term treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril in 47 patients with severe coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Patients received either 20 mg/d enalapril or placebo for 6 days. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>TPA</e>), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plasmin-a2-antiplasmin-complex (PAP) and D-dimers were measured initially and after treatment. RESULTS: In the enalapril group PAI-1 levels were significantly reduced after treatment (11.9 +/- 2.3 U/ml vs. 17.1 +/- 3.0 U/l; P &lt; 0.05). In the placebo group PAP levels were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) after treatment compared to initial values. No differences could be detected between the study groups with regard to TPA and D-dimers. CONCLUSION: Although PAI-1 activity levels are reduced after short-term treatment with ACE inhibitors in patients with stable angina pectoris while TPA antigen is unaffected, treatment with ACE inhibitors does not lead to a marked change in plasmin activation.",M2
19705994,"Role of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in cerebrovascular disease.Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is the only non-invasive examination that provides a reliable evaluation of intracranial blood flow patterns in real-time, adding physiological information to the anatomical information obtained from other neuroimaging modalities. TCD is relatively cheap, can be performed bedside, and allows monitoring both in acute emergency settings as well as for prolonged periods with a high temporal resolution making it ideal for studying dynamic cerebrovascular responses. Extended applications of transcranial Doppler in enhancing intravenous thrombolysis in acute stroke, emboli monitoring, right-to-left shunt detection and vasomotor reactivity provide important information about the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular ischemia. In acute cerebral ischemia, TCD is capable of providing rapid information about the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation, monitoring recanalization in real-time with a potential for enhancing tissue plasminogen activator (<e>TPA</e>) induced thrombolysis. Advanced applications of TCD make it an important and valuable tool for evaluating stroke mechanisms, plan and monitor treatment and determine prognosis. TCD has an established clinical value in the diagnostic workup of stroke patients and is suggested as essential components of a comprehensive stroke center. We have reviewed various recent patents in addition to the diagnostic, therapeutic, as well as, prognostic applications of TCD in patients with cerebrovascular disease.",M2
19699025,"Sonothrombolysis for intraocular fibrin formation in an animal model.Vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal arterial occlusion are always associated with retinal and/or choroidal vasculopathy and intravascular thrombosis is commonly found. The ultrasound (US) therapy is a recently developed technique to accelerate fibrinolysis and it is being applied to some clinical fields. The present study was to observe the effects of extraocular US exposure on intraocular fibrin, which is a deteriorating factor in various ocular diseases. Tubes containing human blood (2 mL) in the following groups were irradiated with US; US alone, US with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), tPA alone, and saline (control). Fibrinolysis was quantified by measuring D-dimer after 2h. In rat eyes, intracameral fibrin (fibrin formation in the anterior chamber of the eye) was induced by YAG-laser-induced iris bleeding. Then, eyes in the following groups were irradiated with US; US alone, subconjunctival tPA alone, US and subconjunctival tPA, control. Intracameral fibrin was scored on day 3 (3+ maximum to 0). The temperatures of rat eyes were measured by infrared thermography. Histologic evaluation was also performed. D-dimer was increased by US with statistical significance (p &lt;0.05) or tPA (p &lt;0.01). D-dimer in US with tPA group was significantly higher than either US alone or tPA alone group (p &lt;0.01). In rat eyes, the average intracameral fibrin score on day 3 was 1.4 in control group and 1.2 in subconjunctival tPA alone group; however, it decreased significantly in the US alone group (0.75; p &lt;0.05, vs. control), US and subconjunctival tPA group (0.71; p &lt;0.01, vs. control). The temperature was less than 34 degrees C after US exposure. No histologic damage was observed. US irradiation from outside accelerated intracameral fibrinolysis without causing apparent tissue damage. This noninvasive method might have therapeutic value for intraocular fibrin.",M2

19683575,"Role of plasminogen activation in neuronal organization and survival.We characterized the interactions between plasminogen and neurons and investigated the associated effects on extracellular matrix proteolysis, cell morphology, adhesion, signaling and survival. Upon binding of plasminogen to neurons, the plasmin formed by constitutively expressed tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) degrades extracellular matrix proteins, leading to retraction of the neuron monolayer that detaches from the matrix. This sequence of events required both interaction of plasminogen with carboxy-terminal lysine residues and the proteolytic activity of plasmin. Surprisingly, 24h after plasminogen addition, plasmin-detached neurons survived and remained associated in clusters maintaining focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation contrasting with other adherent cell types fully dissociated by plasmin. However, long-term incubation (72 h) with plasminogen was associated with an increased rate of apoptosis, suggesting that prolonged exposure to plasmin may cause neurotoxicity. Regulation of neuronal organization and survival by plasminogen may be of pathophysiological relevance, as plasminogen is expressed in the brain and/or extravasate during vascular accidents or inflammatory processes.",M2
19681102,"Acute stroke therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) since it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Since then it has been severely underutilized. At the time when most practitioners were first being exposed to the literature concerning tPA, there were many concerns about safety and the restrictions on use were quite onerous. Since then a good deal of further work has been done to loosen the restrictions and allay concerns about the risks. The true risk to benefit ratio is far better than is generally realized. Now it is mostly economic problems related to the costs of constantly supplying emergency care that is limiting access. Furthermore, in the current litigious environment, failure to treat is likely to be a more hazardous course of action than legal exposure due to poor outcomes. It must be emphasized that the drug is quite safe and highly effective, and current utilization rates are unacceptably low. Ann Neurol 2009;66:6-10.",M2
19672275,"Microglial low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 mediates the effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the ischemic brain.Studies in animal models of cerebral ischemia indicate that besides its thrombolytic effect, treatment with tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) also induces an increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity in the ischemic tissue associated with the development of cerebral edema. Earlier, we had shown that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a substrate for tPA in the brain. In this study, we investigated the effect of the interaction between tPA and microglial LRP1 on MMP-9 activity after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We found that exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions increases MMP-9 activity in wild-type (Wt) and plasminogen-deficient (Plg(-/-)) microglia, but not in tPA (tPA(-/-)) or LRP1-deficient (macLRP-) cells. Treatment with tPA increases MMP-9 expression in tPA(-/-) but not in macLRP- microglia. Middle cerebral artery occlusion increases MMP-9 expression and activity in Wt but not in tPA(-/-) or macLRP- mice, and treatment with tPA increases MMP-9 activity in tPA(-/-) mice but not in macLRP- animals. Finally, MCAO-induced ischemic edema and degradation of the interendothelial right junction protein claudin-5 were significantly attenuated in tPA(-/-) and macLRP- mice. The results of our study indicate that the interaction between tPA and microglial LRP1 increases MMP-9 expression and activity resulting in the degradation of claudin-5 and development of cerebral edema.",M2

We report a randomized multicenter phase II trial of microS dose escalation with systemic thrombolysis. METHODS: Stroke patients receiving 0.9mg/kg tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) with pretreatment proximal intracranial occlusions on transcranial Doppler (TCD) were randomized (2:1 ratio) to microS (MRX-801) infusion over 90 minutes (Cohort 1, 1.4ml; Cohort 2, 2.8ml) with continuous TCD insonation, whereas controls received tPA and brief TCD assessments. The primary endpoint was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) within 36 hours after tPA. RESULTS: Among 35 patients (Cohort 1 = 12, Cohort 2 = 11, controls = 12) no sICH occurred in Cohort 1 and controls, whereas 3 (27%, 2 fatal) sICHs occurred in Cohort 2 (p = 0.028). Sustained complete recanalization/clinical recovery rates (end of TCD monitoring/3 month) were 67%/75% for Cohort 1, 46%/50% for Cohort 2, and 33%/36% for controls (p = 0.255/0.167). The median time to any recanalization tended to be shorter in Cohort 1 (30 min; interquartile range [IQR], 6) and Cohort 2 (30 min; IQR, 69) compared to controls (60 min; IQR, 5; p = 0.054). Although patients with sICH had similar screening and pretreatment systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels in comparison to the rest, higher SBP levels were documented in sICH+ patients at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 24-36 hours following tPA bolus. INTERPRETATION: Perflutren lipid microS can be safely combined with systemic tPA and ultrasound at a dose of 1.4ml. Safety concerns in the second dose tier may necessitate extended enrollment and further experiments to determine the mechanisms by which microspheres interact with tissues. In both dose tiers, sonothrombolysis with microS and tPA shows a trend toward higher early recanalization and clinical recovery rates compared to standard intravenous tPA therapy.

19666776,"Regulation of intrapleural fibrinolysis by urokinase-alpha-macroglobulin complexes in tetracycline-induced pleural injury in rabbits.The proenzyme single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scuPA) more effectively resolved intrapleural loculations in rabbits with tetracycline (TCN)-induced loculation than a range of clinical doses of two-chain uPA (Abbokinase) and demonstrated a trend toward greater efficacy than single-chain <e>tPA</e> (Activase) (Idell S et al., Exp Lung Res 33: 419, 2007.). scuPA more slowly generates durable intrapleural fibrinolytic activity than Abbokinase or Activase, but the interactions of these agents with inhibitors in pleural fluids (PFs) have been poorly understood. PFs from rabbits with TCN-induced pleural injury treated with intrapleural scuPA, its inactive Ser195Ala mutant, Abbokinase, Activase, or vehicle, were analyzed to define the mechanism by which scuPA induces durable fibrinolysis. uPA activity was elevated in PFs of animals treated with scuPA, correlated with the ability to clear pleural loculations, and resisted (70-80%) inhibition by PAI-1. Alpha-macroglobulin (alphaM) but not urokinase receptor complexes immunoprecipitated from PFs of scuPA-treated rabbits retained uPA activity that resists PAI-1 and activates plasminogen. Conversely, little plasminogen activating or enzymatic activity resistant to PAI-1 was detectable in PFs of rabbits treated with Abbokinase or Activase. Consistent with these findings, PAI-1 interacts with scuPA much slower than with Activase or Abbokinase in vitro. An equilibrium between active and inactive scuPA (k(on) = 4.3 h(-1)) limits the rate of its inactivation by PAI-1, favoring formation of complexes with alphaM. These observations define a newly recognized mechanism that promotes durable intrapleural fibrinolysis via formation of alphaM/uPA complexes. These complexes promote uPA-mediated plasminogen activation in scuPA-treated rabbits with TCN-induced pleural injury.",M2

However, CTI-mediated attenuation of fibrinolysis following celite activation of coagulation was observed in pilot studies with the clot lifespan model. The goal of the present study was thus to characterize the mechanism(s) responsible for CTI-mediated hypofibrinolysis. Normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 49.6 microg/ml CTI, with coagulation initiated with celite or tissue factor. Fibrinolysis was initiated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>). Additional experiments utilized plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficient or alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma. Coagulation/fibrinolysis kinetics were monitored with the thrombelastography-based clot lifespan model. In addition to delaying the initiation of coagulation, CTI prolonged clot growth time, delayed the onset of lysis, and prolonged clot lysis time in normal plasma after celite activation. Conversely, CTI increased the speed of clot growth, clot strength, and prolonged clot lysis time after tissue factor activation. Experiments with plasma deficient in antifibrinolytic proteins supported a primary inhibition of tPA by CTI. In addition to anti-FXIIa effects following celite activation, CTI likely exerts an anti-tPA effect, which contributed to hypofibrinolysis in this model.",M2

Adding recC1I (250-750 microg/ml) did not affect fibrinolysis, but prevented fibrinogenolysis and plasminogen depletion by M5, raising its fibrin-specific lysis rate to the maximum. With tPA, the recC1I modestly attenuated fibrinogenolysis, raising its fibrin-specific rate to about half the maximum. Consistent with this, the t(1/2) inhibition by C1I was approximately 90 min for tPA compared with ~10 min for tcM5. The t(1/2) of C1I for plasmin was ~2 min. Zymograms of plasma after clot lysis indicated that recC1I prevented non-specific tcM5 generation from M5, as evidenced by suppression of tcM5:C1I complexes. In conclusion, recC1I raised the fibrin-specificity of M5 in plasma so that a maximum lysis rate could be achieved without fibrinogenolysis. The inhibition by C1I of non-specific but not fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation could not be duplicated by other serpins. The findings provide a potential means to optimize both the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis.",M2
19641311,"In vitro sonothrombolysis with duplex ultrasound: first results using a simplified model.BACKGROUND: The main aim was to study the effects of ultrasound (US) alone, in combination with an US contrast agent (UCA), tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), or the combination of both upon blood clots. METHODS: In order to learn about sonothrombolysis with diagnostic duplex US, a simplified in vitro test model, using human whole blood clots in Petri dishes, was established. RESULTS: A total of 286 blood clots were analyzed. Improved sonothrombolysis due to insonation with diagnostic duplex US could be achieved, whether it was used alone or in combination with tPA. Although already described, a beneficial effect of UCA microbubbles on sonothrombolysis could not be confirmed due to the study design. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic duplex US improves thrombolysis significantly, even when it is used without tPA. To study the effect of UCA microbubbles on sonothrombolysis appropriately, any experimental design should provide continuous replenishment of microbubbles at the target site.",M2
19638998,"Atorvastatin extends the therapeutic window for <e>tPA</e> to 6 h after the onset of embolic stroke in rats.We investigated the neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin in combination with delayed thrombolytic therapy in a rat model of embolic stroke. Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were treated with atorvastatin at 4 h, followed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at 6 or 8 h after stroke. The combination of atorvastatin at 4 h and tPA at 6 h significantly decreased the size of the embolus at the origin of the MCA, improved microvascular patency, and reduced infarct volume, but did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with vehicle-treated control animals. However, monotherapy with tPA at 6 h increased the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and failed to reduce infarct volume compared with the control group. In addition, adjuvant treatment with atorvastatin at 4 h and with tPA at 6 h reduced tPA-induced upregulation of protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular platelet, neutrophil, and fibrin deposition compared with rats treated with tPA alone at 6 h. In conclusion, a combination of atorvastatin and tPA extended the therapeutic window for stroke to 6 h without increasing the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Atorvastatin blocked delayed tPA-potentiated adverse cerebral vascular events, which likely contributes to the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy.",M2
19635468,"NOX2 inhibition with apocynin worsens stroke outcome in aged rats.This study utilized middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>) to assess inhibition of the NOX2 isoform of NADPH oxidase on brain injury and functional recovery in aged rats. Effects of NOX2 on the degree of brain injury and functional recovery following MCAO and tPA reperfusion was assessed in young adult and aged rats. Rats received apocynin (NOX2 inhibitor; 5 mg/kg) or saline 30 min prior to MCAO. At 24 h following MCAO, blood-brain barrier permeability (BBB), stroke infarct volume, edema formation, and oxidative damage were measured. Apocynin treatment in aged rats increased mortality rate and failed to improve functional outcome, total infarct volume, edema formation, and BBB permeability. Aged rats displayed increased BBB permeability to sucrose in the contralateral hemisphere following MCAO and diminished antioxidant capacity in the brain as compared to young adult rats. We conclude that inhibition of NOX2 in the aged rat exacerbates stroke injury and diminishes functional outcome. These results suggest age is an important factor in stroke damage and more rigorous examination of apocynin as a therapeutic agent for treatment of stroke must be done.",M2
19656559,"The use of PEGylated liposomes to prolong circulation lifetimes of tissue plasminogen activator.Tissue plasminogen activator (<e>tPA</e>), a widely used thrombolytic agent, has an application limit due to short half-life. To prolong the half-life of tPA, liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), cholesterol (CHOL) and sodium cholesterol-3-sulfate (CS) were prepared by lipid film method. In addition, distearolyphosphatidyl ethanolamine-N-poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 (DSPE-PEG 2000) was included to give steric barrier to liposomes. Physicochemical characteristics such as particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and long-term storage stability at 4 degrees C were investigated. The fibrinolytic activity of tPA-loaded in liposomes was confirmed by fibrin clot lysis assay. In vivo pharmacokinetic properties of tPA and the effect of PEG on the blood circulation of tPA-loaded in liposomes in circulation were also evaluated. Both conventional liposomes (EPCL) and PEGylated liposomes (EPC-PEGL) were proper as an injectable formulation with small particle size. Loading process of tPA into liposomes did not alter fibrinolytic activity of intact tPA. Encapsulation of tPA into EPCL and EPC-PEGL prolonged half-life of tPA by 16 and 21 folds compared with free tPA, respectively. Therefore, the use of liposomes could prolong the circulation lifetimes and longevity effect of liposomes on tPA was increased by PEG.",M2
19652882,"Prognostic impact of haemostatic derangements in chronic heart failure.Heart failure is characterised by activation of haemostasis. We sought to explore the prognostic impact of deranged haemostasis in chronic heart failure. In stable, optimally managed outpatients with chronic heart failure, baseline levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2, D-dimer, and <e>tPA</e> and PAI-1 antigens were determined. Clinical follow-up was obtained and the rate of events (heart failure related deaths or hospitalisations) was recorded. We included 195 patients [32.3% female, NYHA class II (66.2%) or III (33.8%), mean age 71 years]. During a median follow up of 693 (interquartile range [IQR] 574-788) days, 63 (30.9%) patients experienced an event; those with an event had higher levels of tPA antigen (median 11.8 [IQR 8.7-14.0] vs. 9.4 [7.9-12.1] microg/l; p = 0.033) and D-dimer (938 [485-1269] vs. 620 [37-1076] microg/l; p = 0.018). However, on Cox multivariate analysis, only tPA levels above optimal cut-off value of 10.2 microg/l (but not D-dimer) emerged as an independent predictor of prognosis (HR(adjusted) 2.695, 95% confidence interval 1.233-5.363; p = 0.017). Our findings suggest that elevated tPA antigen levels are an independent prognostic predictor in patients with chronic stable heart failure.",M2
