20518490,"Energetic effects of magnesium in the recognition of adenosine nucleotides by the F(1)-ATPase beta subunit.Nucleotide-induced conformational changes of the catalytic beta subunits play a crucial role in the rotary mechanism of F(1)-ATPase. To gain insights into the energetic bases that govern the recognition of nucleotides by the isolated beta subunit from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (Tbeta), the binding of this monomer to Mg(II)-free and Mg(II)-bound adenosine nucleotides was characterized using high-precision isothermal titration calorimetry. The interactions of Mg(II) with free ATP or <e>ADP</e> were also measured calorimetrically. A model that considers simultaneously the interactions of Tbeta with Mg.ATP or with ATP and in which ATP is able to bind two Mg(II) atoms sequentially was used to determine the formation parameters of the Tbeta-Mg.ATP complex from calorimetric data. This analysis yielded significantly different DeltaH(b) and DeltaS(b) values in relation to those obtained using a single-binding site model, while DeltaG(b) was almost unchanged. Published calorimetric data for the titration of Tbeta with Mg.ADP [Perez-Hernandez, G., et al. (2002) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 408, 177-183] were reanalyzed with the ternary model to determine the corresponding true binding parameters. Interactions of Tbeta with Mg.ATP, ATP, Mg.ADP, or ADP were enthalpically driven. Larger differences in thermodynamic properties were observed between Tbeta-Mg.ATP and Tbeta-ATP complexes than between Tbeta-Mg.ADP and Tbeta-ADP complexes or between Tbeta-Mg.ATP and Tbeta-Mg.ADP complexes. These binding data, in conjunction with those for the association of Mg(II) with free nucleotides, allowed for a determination of the energetic effects of the metal ion on the recognition of adenosine nucleotides by Tbeta [i.e., Tbeta.AT(D)P + Mg(II) right harpoon over left harpoon Tbeta.AT(D)P-Mg]. Because of a more favorable binding enthalpy, Mg(II) is recognized more avidly by the Tbeta.ATP complex, indicating better stereochemical complementarity than in the Tbeta.ADP complex. Furthermore, a structural-energetic analysis suggests that Tbeta adopts a more closed conformation when it is bound to Mg.ATP than to ATP or Mg.ADP, in agreement with recently published NMR data [Yagi, H., et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 2374-2382]. Using published binding data, a similar analysis of Mg(II) energetic effects was performed for the free energy change of F(1) catalytic sites, in the framework of bi- or tri-site binding models.",M1
20457838,"Effect of purinergic receptor activation on Na+-K+ pump activity, excitability, and function in depolarized skeletal muscle.Activity-induced elevation of extracellular purines and pyrimidines has been associated with autocrine and paracrine signaling in many tissues. Here we investigate the effect of purinergic signaling for the excitability and contractility of depolarized skeletal muscle. Muscle excitability was experimentally depressed by elevating the extracellular K(+) from 4 to 10 mM, which reduced the tetanic force to 24 +/- 2% of the force at 4 mM K(+). Upon addition of 1 mM ATP, however, the force recovered to 65 +/- 8% of the control force (P &lt; 0.001, n = 5). A similar recovery was seen with <e>ADP</e>, but not with UTP or adenosine. The ATP-induced force recovery could be inhibited by P2Y(1) receptor antagonists (3 muM SCH-202676 or 1 muM MRS-2500). A fourfold increase in M-wave area demonstrated that the ATP-induced force recovery was associated with restoration of muscle excitability (P &lt; 0.05, n = 4). Experiments using (86)Rb(+) as a tracer for K(+) showed that ATP also induced a twofold increase in the activity of muscle Na(+)-K(+) pumps. The force recovery and the stimulation of the Na(+)-K(+) pump activity by ATP were inhibited by 50 muM of the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122. It is concluded that purinergic signaling can increase the Na(+)-K(+) pump activity and improve force and excitability of depolarized skeletal muscles. This novel purinergic regulation may be important for the maintenance of muscle excitability during intense exercise, where the extracellular K(+) can increase substantially.",M1
20452885,"Whole blood coagulation and platelet activation in the athlete: a comparison of marathon, triathlon and long distance cycling.INTRODUCTION: Serious thrombembolic events occur in otherwise healthy marathon athletes during competition. We tested the hypothesis that during heavy endurance sports coagulation and platelets are activated depending on the type of endurance sport with respect to its running fraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 68 healthy athletes participating in marathon (MAR, running 42 km, n = 24), triathlon (TRI, swimming 2.5 km + cycling 90 km + running 21 km, n = 22), and long distance cycling (CYC, 151 km, n = 22) were included in the study. Blood samples were taken before and immediately after completion of competition to perform rotational thrombelastometry. We assessed coagulation time (CT), maximum clot firmness (MCF) after intrinsically activation and fibrin polymerization (FIBTEM). Furthermore, platelet aggregation was tested after activation with <e>ADP</e> and thrombin activating peptide 6 (TRAP) by using multiple platelet function analyzer. RESULTS: Complete data sets were obtained in 58 athletes (MAR: n = 20, TRI: n = 19, CYC: n = 19). CT significantly decreased in all groups (MAR -9.9%, TRI -8.3%, CYC -7.4%) without differences between groups. In parallel, MCF (MAR +7.4%, TRI +6.1%, CYC +8.3%) and fibrin polymerization (MAR +14.7%, TRI +6.1%, CYC +8.3%) were significantly increased in all groups. However, platelets were only activated during MAR and TRI as indicated by increased AUC during TRAP-activation (MAR +15.8%) and increased AUC during ADP-activation in MAR (+50.3%) and TRI (+57.5%). DISCUSSION: While coagulation is activated during physical activity irrespective of type we observed significant platelet activation only during marathon and to a lesser extent during triathlon. We speculate that prolonged running may increase platelet activity, possibly, due to mechanical alteration. Thus, particularly prolonged running may increase the risk of thrombembolic incidents in running athletes.",M1
20450882,"Structural changes associated with the acute thermal instability of Rubisco activase.Inhibition of photosynthesis by heat has been linked to the instability of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) chaperone, Rubisco activase. Examination of the recombinant enzyme showed that <e>ADP</e> and ATP protected against inactivation, whereas Mg(2+) promoted inactivation. Heating caused aggregation of Rubisco activase characterized by disruption of secondary structure content and formation of insoluble protein. In contrast, incubation at room temperature without nucleotide caused the active approximately 660 kDa protein to form a soluble, but inactive aggregate of &gt; 2 x 10(6) Da. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and fluorescence established that structural perturbations in the aggregate did not reduce alpha-helical content significantly. Differences in the thermal stability between wild type and mutant Rubisco activase were observed for the recombinant proteins and when the proteins were expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. That the sensitivity of these plants to heat differs indicates that the thermal instability of Rubisco activase is a main determinant of the temperature-sensitivity of photosynthesis.",M1
20442322,"Acute elevation of plasma lipids does not affect ATP synthesis in human skeletal muscle.Prolonged elevation of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) reduces insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and myocellular flux through ATP synthase (fATPase). However, the early effects of lipids per se on fATPase are as yet unclear. Thus, this study examined glucose disposal and fATPase during 3 h of FFA elevation in the presence of low plasma insulinemia. Euglycemic pancreatic clamps with low-dose insulin supplementation (6 mU.m body surface area(-2).min(-1)) were performed in eight healthy men with (LIP) or without (CON) lipid infusion to measure whole body glucose disposal. (31)P/(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of calf muscle was applied to quantify fATPase and concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), inorganic phosphate (P(i)), phosphocreatine (PCr), <e>ADP</e>, pH, and IMCL before and during the clamps. Lipid infusion increased plasma FFA approximately twofold and decreased glucose disposal by approximately 50% (110-180 min: LIP 0.87 +/- 0.45 vs. CON 1.75 +/- 0.42 mg.kg(-1).min(-1), P = 0.002; means +/- SD). Intramyocellular G6P tended to rise only under control conditions, whereas PCr, ADP, pH, and IMCL remained unchanged from fasting in LIP and CON. Although P(i) concentrations increased by approximately 18%, fATPase remained unchanged from fasting during the clamps (LIP 10.2 +/- 2.2 vs. CON 10.5 +/- 2.6 micromol.g muscle(-1).min(-1), P = not significant). We conclude that 3 h of lipid elevation fail to affect ATP synthesis despite marked reduction of whole body glucose uptake. This suggests that lipid-induced insulin resistance results primarily from mechanisms decreasing glucose uptake rather than from direct interference of fatty acid metabolites with mitochondrial function.",M1
20441566,"Role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase beta in platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation mediated by Gi signalling pathways.PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) play a critical role in platelet functional responses. PI3Ks are activated upon P2Y12 receptor stimulation and generate pro-aggregatory signals. P2Y12 receptor has been shown to play a key role in the platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation caused by co-stimulation with Gq or Gz, or super-stimulation of Gi pathways. In the present study, we evaluated the role of specific PI3K isoforms alpha, beta, gamma and delta in platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2 generation and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation. Our results show that loss of the PI3K signal impaired the ability of <e>ADP</e> to induce platelet aggregation, ERK phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 generation. We also show that Gq plus Gi- or Gi plus Gz-mediated platelet aggregation, ERK phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 generation in human platelets was inhibited by TGX-221, a PI3Kbeta-selective inhibitor, but not by PIK75 (a PI3Kalpha inhibitor), AS252424 (a PI3Kgamma inhibitor) or IC87114 (a PI3Kdelta inhibitor). TGX-221 also showed a similar inhibitory effect on the Gi plus Gz-mediated platelet responses in platelets from P2Y1-/- mice. Finally, 2MeSADP (2-methyl-thio-ADP)-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in the presence of TGX-221, suggesting a critical role for PI3Kbeta in Gi-mediated signalling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PI3Kbeta plays an important role in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, PI3Kbeta mediates ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation by regulating ERK phosphorylation.",M1
20420312,"In vitro inhibitory activities of Lauraceae aporphine alkaloids.The in vitro anti-inflammatory effect of eight aporphine alkaloids isolated from the leaves of two Lauraceae plants (Pleurothyrium cinereum and Ocotea macrophylla) was evaluated through inhibition of two isozymes of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and platelet aggregation induced by PAF, AA and <e>ADP</e>. All alkaloids exhibited inhibitory activities against COX-2 (IC50 25.9-116 microM range) and PAF- and AA-induced platelet aggregation, while only four and three of them were good COX-1 and 5-LOX inhibitors, respectively. (+)-N-acetyl-nornantenine 6 was the most potent COX-2, 5-LOX, AA and PAF inhibitor.",M1
20394748,"Nucleotide-dependent behavior of single molecules of cytoplasmic dynein on microtubules in vitro.We visualized the nucleotide-dependent behavior of single molecules of mammalian native cytoplasmic dynein using fragments of dynactin p150 with or without its N-terminal microtubule binding domain. The results indicate that the binding affinity of dynein for microtubules is high in AMP-PNP, middle in <e>ADP</e> or no nucleotide, and low in ADP.Pi conditions. It is also demonstrated that the microtubule binding domain of dynactin p150 maintains the association of dynein with microtubules without altering the motile property of dynein in the weak binding state. In addition, we observed bidirectional movement of dynein in the presence of ATP as well as in ADP/Vi condition, suggesting that the bidirectional movement is driven by diffusion rather than active transport.",M1
20394442,"When is weaker better? Design of an <e>ADP</e> sensor with weak ADP affinity, but still selective against ATP.A simple ADP biosensor would be of broad usefulness in monitoring the large number of metabolic processes that produce ADP.

20388712,"The Zn3 domain of human poly(<e>ADP</e>-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) functions in both DNA-dependent poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis activity and chromatin compaction.PARP-1 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, and apoptosis. PARP-1 attaches ADP-ribose units to target proteins, including itself as a post-translational modification that can change the biochemical properties of target proteins and mediate recruitment of proteins to sites of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis. Independent of its catalytic activity, PARP-1 binds to chromatin and promotes compaction affecting RNA polymerase II transcription. PARP-1 has a modular structure composed of six independent domains. Two homologous zinc fingers, Zn1 and Zn2, form the DNA-binding module. Zn1-Zn2 binding to DNA breaks triggers catalytic activity. Recently, we have identified a third zinc binding domain in PARP-1, the Zn3 domain, which is essential for DNA-dependent PARP-1 activity. The crystal structure of the Zn3 domain revealed a novel zinc-ribbon fold and a homodimeric Zn3 structure that formed in the crystal lattice. Structure-guided mutagenesis was used here to investigate the roles of these two features of the Zn3 domain. Our results indicate that the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain mediates an interdomain contact crucial to assembly of the DNA-activated conformation of PARP-1. In contrast, residues located at the Zn3 dimer interface are not required for DNA-dependent activation but rather make important contributions to the chromatin compaction activity of PARP-1. Thus, the Zn3 domain has dual roles in regulating the functions of PARP-1.",M1
20385092,"The conformational dynamics of the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone.Heat shock proteins 70 (Hsp70) represent a ubiquitous and conserved family of molecular chaperones involved in a plethora of cellular processes. The dynamics of their ATP hydrolysis-driven and cochaperone-regulated conformational cycle are poorly understood. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to analyze, in real time and at single-molecule resolution, the effects of nucleotides and cochaperones on the conformation of Ssc1, a mitochondrial member of the family. We report that the conformation of its <e>ADP</e> state is unexpectedly heterogeneous, in contrast to a uniform ATP state. Substrates are actively involved in determining the conformation of Ssc1. The J protein Mdj1 does not interact transiently with the chaperone, as generally believed, but rather is released slowly upon ATP hydrolysis. Analysis of the major bacterial Hsp70 revealed important differences between highly homologous members of the family, possibly explaining tuning of Hsp70 chaperones to meet specific functions in different organisms and cellular compartments.",M1
20382158,"The crystal structure of protein MJ1225 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii shows strong conservation of key structural features seen in the eukaryal gamma-AMPK.In mammals, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). The gamma-subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding AMP and ATP and is thought to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex. We describe herein the crystal structure of protein MJ1225 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii complexed to AMP, <e>ADP</e>, and ATP. Our data provide evidence of a strong conservation of the key functional features seen in the gamma-subunit of the eukaryotic AMPK, and more importantly, it reveals a novel AMP binding site, herein denoted as site E, which had not been previously described in cystathionine beta-synthase domains so far. Site E is located in a small cavity existing between the alpha-helices structurally equivalent to those disrupting the internal symmetry of each Bateman domain in gamma-AMPKs and shows striking similarities with a symmetry-related crevice of the mammalian enzyme that hosts the pathological mutation N488I.",M1
20380360,"The effect of a pneumatic tube transport system on platelet aggregation using optical aggregometry and the PFA-100.BACKGROUND: Pneumatic tube sample transport is widely used in hospitals because it is convenient and reduces turnaround times. However, the preanalytical effects of pneumatic tube transport of blood samples on platelet function analysis are not fully understood. METHODS: Blood samples from 15 healthy subjects were collected before and after treatment with acetylsalicylic acid. Sample tubes were transported by pneumatic tube transport while the corresponding sample tubes were hand-delivered. Platelet function analysis was performed in platelet rich plasma by optical aggregometry and in whole blood by the PFA-100. RESULTS: Using the collagen-induced optical aggregometry a significant decrease of the aggregation amplitude (n = 30) was observed in tubed samples in comparison to the corresponding hand-delivered samples (low collagen concentration: 52.5% vs 56.1%, p = 0.006; and high collagen concentration respectively: 63.9% vs 67.1%, p = 0.011). Additionally, a slight prolongation of the PFA-100TM closure time for the epinephrine/collagen and the <e>ADP</e>/collagen stimulation was found in the tubed samples compared to the hand-delivered samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the pneumatic tube sample transport impairs the platelet aggregation. Therefore, we recommend the manual transport of whole blood samples which are collected for optical aggregometry or PFA-100 analysis.",M1
20375022,"Flexibility between the protease and helicase domains of the dengue virus NS3 protein conferred by the linker region and its functional implications.The dengue virus (DENV) NS3 protein is essential for viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication. It contains an N-terminal serine protease region (residues 1-168) joined to an RNA helicase (residues 180-618) by an 11-amino acid linker (169-179). The structure at 3.15 A of the soluble NS3 protein from DENV4 covalently attached to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor region (NS2B(18)NS3) revealed an elongated molecule with the protease domain abutting subdomains I and II of the helicase (Luo, D., Xu, T., Hunke, C., Grüber, G., Vasudevan, S. G., and Lescar, J. (2008) J. Virol. 82, 173-183). Unexpectedly, using similar crystal growth conditions, we observed an alternative conformation where the protease domain has rotated by approximately 161 degrees with respect to the helicase domain. We report this new crystal structure bound to <e>ADP</e>-Mn(2+) refined to a resolution of 2.2 A. The biological significance for interdomain flexibility conferred by the linker region was probed by either inserting a Gly residue between Glu(173) and Pro(174) or replacing Pro(174) with a Gly residue. Both mutations resulted in significantly lower ATPase and helicase activities. We next increased flexibility in the linker by introducing a Pro(176) to Gly mutation in a DENV2 replicon system. A 70% reduction in luciferase reporter signal and a similar reduction in the level of viral RNA synthesis were observed. Our results indicate that the linker region has evolved to an optimum length to confer flexibility to the NS3 protein that is required both for polyprotein processing and RNA replication.",M1
20361728,"Phosphorylation of the transcription factor Ets-1 by ERK2: rapid dissociation of <e>ADP</e> and phospho-Ets-1.ERK2, a major effector of the BRAF oncogene, is a promiscuous protein kinase that has a strong preference for phosphorylating substrates on Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro motifs. As part of a program to understand the fundamental basis for ERK2 substrate recognition and catalysis, we have studied the mechanism by which ERK2 phosphorylates the transcription factor Ets-1 at Thr-38. A feature of the mechanism in the forward direction is a partially rate-limiting product release step (koff = 59 +/- 6 s(-1)), which is significant because to approach maximum efficiency substrates for ERK2 may evolve to ensure that ADP dissociation is rate-limiting. To improve our understanding of the mechanism of product release, the binding of the products to ERK2 was assessed and the reaction was examined in the reverse direction. These studies demonstrated that phospho-Ets-1 (p-Ets) binds &gt;20-fold more tightly to ERK2 than ADP (Kd = 7.3 and 165 microM, respectively) and revealed that the products exhibit little interaction energetically while bound to ERK2 and that they can dissociate ERK2 in a random order. The overall equilibrium for the reaction in solution (Keq = 250 M(-1)) was found to be similar to that with the substrate bound to the enzyme (Kint = 525 M(-1)). To determine what limits koff, several pre-steady-state experiments were performed. A catalytic trapping approach furnished a rate constant (k-ADPa) of 61 +/- 12 s(-1) for the dissociation of ADP from the abortive ternary complex, ERK2.Ets.ADP. To examine p-Ets dissociation, the binding of a fluorescent derivative (p-Ets-F), which binds ERK2 with an affinity similar to that of p-Ets, was examined by stopped-flow kinetics. Using this approach, p-Ets-F was found to bind through a single-step mechanism, with the following parameters: k-p-Ets-F = 121 +/- 3.8 s(-1), and kp-Ets-F = (9.4 +/- 0.3) X 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). Similar results were found in the presence of a saturating ADP concentration. These data suggest that koff may be limited by the dissociation of both products and are consistent with the notion that Ets-1 has evolved to be an efficient substrate for ERK2, where ADP release is, at least, partially rate-limiting. A molecular mechanics model of the complex formed between ERK2 and residues 28-138 of Ets-1 provides insight into the role of substrate docking interactions.",M1
20351242,"Myosin complexed with <e>ADP</e> and blebbistatin reversibly adopts a conformation resembling the start point of the working stroke.The powerstroke of the myosin motor is the basis of cell division and bodily movement, but has eluded empirical description due to the short lifetime and low abundance of intermediates during force generation. To gain insight into this process, we used well-established single-tryptophan and pyrene fluorescent sensors and electron microscopy to characterize the structural and kinetic properties of myosin complexed with ADP and blebbistatin, a widely used inhibitor. We found that blebbistatin does not weaken the tight actin binding of myosin.ADP, but unexpectedly it induces lever priming, a process for which the gamma-phosphate of ATP (or its analog) had been thought necessary. The results indicate that a significant fraction of the myosin.ADP.blebbistatin complex populates a previously inaccessible conformation of myosin resembling the start of the powerstroke.",M1
20308583,"Out-of-equilibrium conformational cycling of GroEL under saturating ATP concentrations.The molecular chaperone GroEL exists in at least two allosteric states, T and R, that interconvert in an ATP-controlled manner. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the T-state population becomes negligible with increasing ATP concentrations, in conflict with the requirement for conformational cycling, which is essential for the operation of molecular machines. To solve this conundrum, we performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on the single-ring version of GroEL, using a fluorescent switch recently built into its structure, which turns  on,  i.e., increases its fluorescence dramatically, when ATP is added. A series of correlation functions was measured as a function of ATP concentration and analyzed using singular-value decomposition. The analysis assigned the signal to two states whose dynamics clearly differ. Surprisingly, even at ATP saturation, approximately 50% of the molecules still populate the T state at any instance of time, indicating constant out-of-equilibrium cycling between T and R. Only upon addition of the cochaperonin GroES does the T-state population vanish. Our results suggest a model in which the T/R ratio is controlled by the rate of <e>ADP</e> release after hydrolysis, which can be determined accordingly.",M1
20229679,"Changes in platelets and anticoagulant protein activity during adenosine-exercise single-photon emission computed tomography stress test.INTRODUCTION: Activation of haemostasis during physical stress or during myocardial ischemia could be an important mechanism to trigger coronary and stent thrombosis. We examined changes in haemostatic parameters and its association with myocardial ischemia during adenosine-exercise-SPECT (adeno-EX) stress test in coronary patients at least 4 months after coronary stenting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine relationship between changes in haemostatic parameters and stress induced myocardial ischemia quantified by perfusion scintigraphy in stented coronary patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (26 on clopidogrel plus aspirin and 11 on aspirin only) 4-8 months after successful intracoronary stent implantation were enrolled in the study. We determined the levels of platelet aggregability (PA) on <e>ADP</e> (PA-ADP) and epinephrine (PA-EPI), beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor-4, protein C (PC) and antithrombin (AT) before and 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 150 micro/kg adenosine for4 minutes concomitant with supine ergo-bicycle exercise test for 50 W. The size of stress perfusion defect was measured 15 minutes after stress and in rest 4 hours later by 99mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) within 17 myocardial segments. RESULTS: There were no differences between haemostatic parameters before and after stress. A significant myocardial ischemia after exercise was registered in 12 patients on combined antiaggregation therapy and in 5 patients on aspirin. In this preliminary report, because of a small number of patients in the aspirin group we did not analyse difference in the levels of haemostatic markers and their correlations with the size of perfusion defect. The only significant difference between measured haemostatic parameters in the patients with stress induced ischemia compared to the patients without it, was a lower level of AT activity after stress (81.0% vs. 87.5%; p = 0.027). Antithrombin activity before stress had significant negative correlation with the size of perfusion defect in rest (R2 = 0.219; p = 0.016) and PC activity before stress had significant linear correlation with stress perfusion defect (R2 = 0.248; p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Baseline activities of natural anticoagulant proteins AT and PC are associated with the size of myocardial perfusion defect during adeno-EX-SPECT test. Patients with significant stress-induced ischemia had lower levels of AT activity after stress.",M1
20228794,"Robust processivity of myosin V under off-axis loads.The dimeric motor myosin V transports organelles along actin filament tracks over long distances in cells. Myosin V is a smart 'walker' that is able to swiftly adjust to variable 'road conditions' to continue its processive movement across dense cellular environments. Coordination between the two heads via intramolecular load modulates biochemical kinetics and ensures highly efficient unidirectional motion. However, little is known about how load-induced regulation of the processive stepping occurs in vivo, where myosin V experiences significant off-axis loads applied in various directions. To reveal how myosin V remains processive in cells, we measured the effect of the off-axis loads, applied to individual actomyosin V bonds in a range of angles, on the coordination between the two heads and myosin V processive stepping. We found that myosin V remains highly processive under diagonal loads owing to asymmetrical <e>ADP</e> affinities and that the native 6IQ lever optimizes the subunit coordination, which indicates that myosin V is designed to be an intracellular transporter.",M1
20226794,"Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane bound-glutathione transferase by mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors including cyclosporin A.AIMS: Effect of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitors on mitochondrial membrane-bound glutathione transferase (mtMGST1) activity in rat liver was investigated in vitro. MAIN METHODS: When mitochondria were incubated with MPT inhibitors, mtMGST1 activity was decreased dose dependently and their 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) were 1.2 microM (cyclosporin A; CsA), 31 microM (bongkrekic acid; BKA), 1.8 mM (<e>ADP</e>), and 3.2 mM (ATP). The decrease of mtMGST1 activity by the MPT inhibitors was not observed in the presence of detergent Triton X-100. On the contrary, mtMGST1 inhibition by GST inhibitors such as cibacron blue (IC(50), 4.2 microM) and S-hexylglutathione (IC(50), 480 microM) was not affected in the presence of detergent. Although mtMGST1 resides in both the inner (IMM) and outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM), only mtMGST1 in the IMM was inhibited by the MPT inhibitors in the absence of detergent. GST inhibitors decreased mtMGST1 activity both in the IMM and OMM regardless of the presence or absence of detergent. Cytosolic GSTs and microsomal MGST1 were not inhibited by the MPT inhibitors. KEY FINDINGS: These results indicate that mtMGST1 is inhibited by MPT inhibitors through membrane components, not directly by the inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: Since CsA binds to cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) in the mitochondrial matrix whereas BKA or ADP binds to adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in the IMM, it was suggested that mtMGST1 in the IMM interacts with Cyp-D/ANT and the binding of MPT inhibitors to Cyp-D or ANT causes their conformational change followed by an alteration of mtMGST1 conformation, resulting in decreasing mtMGST1 activity.",M1
20223214,"The C-terminal BAG domain of BAG5 induces conformational changes of the Hsp70 nucleotide-binding domain for <e>ADP</e>-ATP exchange.ADP-ATP exchange by the molecular chaperone Hsp70 is enhanced by several cochaperones. BAG5 consists of five BAG domains and associates with the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70. The overexpression of BAG5 in the cytosol reportedly disturbs Hsp70-mediated protein refolding and induces Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we found that the fifth BAG domain (BD5) of BAG5 is responsible for the interaction between Hsp70 and BAG5. We also determined the crystal structures of the BD5*NBD complex. BD5 binding caused two different types of NBD conformational changes, which both disrupted the nucleotide-binding groove. In fact, BD5 reduced the affinity of the NBD for ADP. Moreover, BD5, as well as the full-length BAG5, accelerated Hsp70-mediated refolding in an in vitro assay. Therefore, BAG5 can function as the nucleotide exchange factor of Hsp70 for the enhancement of protein refolding.",M1
20218792,"The first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs affect <e>ADP</e>-induced platelet aggregation.OBJECTIVE: Blood platelets play an important role in haemostasis and their hyperaggregability may lead to thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases. Increased incidence of mortality, caused by cardiovascular disease, and the increased risk of thrombotic complication in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics have been reported. The effects of antipsychotic drugs on blood platelet function are not fully explained, therefore the purpose of the present study was to examine and compare the effects of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs used in schizophrenia (clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine), with the effects of the first generation antipsychotic, haloperidol, on the platelet aggregation induced by ADP in vitro. METHODS: Blood obtained from healthy volunteers (n=25) collected into sodium citrate was centrifuged (250xg, 10 min) at room temperature to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation of blood platelets (10 microM ADP) was recorded (Chrono-log aggregometer) in platelet-rich plasma preincubated with antipsychotic drugs (final concentration: clozapine 420 ng/ml, risperidone 65 ng/ml, olanzapine 40 ng/ml, haloperidol 20 ng/ml) for 30 min. RESULTS: Our results showed that all tested drugs inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP in vitro. Among studied antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine significantly reduced platelet aggregability in vitro. In comparison with control platelets (without the drug), clozapine inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 21% (P=3.7x10(-6)) and olanzapine by 18% (P=2.8x10(-4)), respectively. CONCLUSION: The obtained results indicate that antipsychotic drugs, especially clozapine and olanzapine, contrary to haloperidol, reduced response of blood platelets to ADP measured as platelet aggregation. This suggests that therapy with such antipsychotics, particularly with second-generation antipsychotics, may partly reduce prothrombotic events associated with the increased platelet activation observed in schizophrenic patients. The mechanism of antiaggregatory influence of antipsychotics requires further studies.",M1
20209924,"[Dose-effect relationship of traditional Chinese medicine formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis on <e>ADP</e>-induced platelet aggregation and rabbit plasma thrombin time]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of five traditional Chinese medicine formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis (Xuefuzhuyu Tang, Shaofuzhuyu Tang, Gexiazhuyu Tang, ShentongZhuyu Tang, Tongqiaohuoxue Tang) on platelet aggregation and clotting time in a dose-response relationship. METHOD: The platelet aggregation was tested with Born's method and thrombin time (TT) method was established to determine the clotting time. RESULT: The formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis showed significant inhibitory effects on the platelet aggregation and prolonged clotting time, the supernate of 80% alcohol solution showed the most potent inhibitory activity among the three kinds of samples from one formula (P &lt; 0.01), especially the supernate of Shaofuzhuyu Tang and Gexiazhuyu Tang were better than other formula on platelet aggregation. About the anticoagulant, the whole formula showed the evidently prolonging the clotting time than other two fractions (P &lt; 0.01) and the precipitation were the worst. CONCLUSION: The formula for promoting blood circulation to remove stasis showed significant effect on platelet aggregation and clotting time, and different samples of the formula had different efficacy. The study established a foundation for further bio-activity evaluation of these formulae and provided evidence for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",M1
20193044,"Inhibition kinetics of catabolic dehydrogenases by elevated moieties of ATP and <e>ADP</e>--implication for a new regulation mechanism in Lactococcus lactis.ATP and ADP inhibit, in varying degrees, several dehydrogenases of the central carbon metabolism of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 19435 in vitro, i.e. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Here we demonstrate mixed inhibition for GAPDH and competitive inhibition for LDH and ADH by adenine nucleotides in single inhibition studies. The nonlinear negative co-operativity was best modelled with Hill-type kinetics, showing greater flexibility than the usual parabolic inhibition equation. Because these natural inhibitors are present simultaneously in the cytoplasm, multiple inhibition kinetics was determined for each dehydrogenase. For ADH and LDH, the inhibitor combinations ATP plus NAD and ADP plus NAD are indifferent to each other. Model discrimination suggested that the weak allosteric inhibition of GAPDH had no relevance when multiple inhibitors are present. Interestingly, with ADH and GAPDH the combination of ATP and ADP exhibits lower dissociation constants than with either inhibitor alone. Moreover, the concerted inhibition of ADH and GAPDH, but not of LDH, shows synergy between the two nucleotides. Similar kinetics, but without synergies, were found for horse liver and yeast ADHs, indicating that dehydrogenases can be modulated by these nucleotides in a nonlinear manner in many organisms. The action of an elevated pool of ATP and ADP may effectively inactivate lactococcal ADH, but not GAPDH and LDH, providing leverage for the observed metabolic shift to homolactic acid formation in lactococcal resting cells on maltose. Therefore, we interpret these results as a regulation mechanism contributing to readjusting the flux of ATP production in L. lactis.",M1
20189992,"An important role of the SRC family kinase Lyn in stimulating platelet granule secretion.The Src family kinases (SFKs) have been proposed to play stimulatory and inhibitory roles in platelet activation. The mechanisms for these apparently contradictory roles are unclear. Here we show that SFK, mainly Lyn, is important in stimulating a common signaling pathway leading to secretion of platelet granules. Lyn knock-out or an isoform-nonselective SFK inhibitor, PP2, inhibited platelet secretion of both dense and alpha granules and the secretion-dependent platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, collagen, and thromboxane A(2). The inhibitory effect of Lyn knock-out on platelet aggregation was reversed by supplementing granule content <e>ADP</e>, indicating that the primary role of Lyn is to stimulate granule secretion. Inhibitory effect of PP2 on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin and thromboxane A(2) were also reversed by supplementing ADP. Furthermore, PP2 treatment or Lyn knock-out diminished agonist-induced Akt activation and cyclic GMP production. The inhibitory effect of PP2 or Lyn knock-out on platelet response can be corrected by supplementing cyclic GMP. These data indicate that Lyn stimulates platelet secretion by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP pathway and also provide an explanation why Lyn can both stimulate and inhibit platelet activation.",M1

Superoxide production, adenosine phosphate concentrations, and mRNA levels of avian uncoupling protein, avian adenine nucleotide translocator, and avian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha in skeletal muscles.The effect of transport stress on superoxide production and adenosine phosphate concentration in addition to avian uncoupling protein (avUCP), avian adenine nucleotide translocator, and avian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha mRNA levels of skeletal muscles in broilers was investigated. Arbor Acres chicks (n = 360, 46 d old, males) were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 treatments: unstressed control, 45-min (short-term) transport with 45-min (short-term) recovery, 45-min transport with 3-h (long-term) recovery, 3-h (long-term) transport with 45-min recovery, and 3-h transport with 3-h recovery. Each treatment consisted of 6 replicates with 12 birds each. All birds (except control group) were transported according to a designed protocol. Transport time affected reactive oxygen species production in the thigh muscle (P &lt; 0.05), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and energy charge (EC) in both breast and thigh muscles (P &lt; 0.05 for all 4 comparisons), ATP:adenosine diphosphate (<e>ADP</e>) ratio in the breast muscle (P &lt; 0.05), and avUCP mRNA levels in the thigh muscle (P &lt; 0.05). Long-term transport increased (P &lt; 0.05) reactive oxygen species production, ATP content, ATP:ADP ratio, and EC in the thigh muscle, but it decreased ATP content, ATP:ADP ratio, and EC in the breast muscle. Long-term transport increased avUCP mRNA in the thigh muscle (P &lt; 0.05). Long-term recovery increased the ATP (P &lt; 0.05) and ADP (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations, avian adenine nucleotide translocator mRNA (P &lt; 0.05), and avian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha mRNA (P &lt; 0.05) in the thigh muscle, whereas EC decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the breast muscle. There were interactions between transport and recovery time on ATP (P &lt; 0.05), EC (P &lt; 0.05), and avUCP mRNA level (P &lt; 0.05) in the thigh muscle. This study suggests that long-term transport accelerates muscle energy metabolism and lipid peroxidation. A long-term recovery may help alleviate cellular damage and maintain meat quality by reducing the rate of energy metabolism and scavenging of free radicals formed.",M1
20167596,"Magnesium coordination controls the molecular switch function of DNA mismatch repair protein MutS.The DNA mismatch repair protein MutS acts as a molecular switch. It toggles between <e>ADP</e> and ATP states and is regulated by mismatched DNA. This is analogous to G-protein switches and the regulation of their  on  and  off  states by guanine exchange factors. Although GDP release in monomeric GTPases is accelerated by guanine exchange factor-induced removal of magnesium from the catalytic site, we found that release of ADP from MutS is not influenced by the metal ion in this manner. Rather, ADP release is induced by the binding of mismatched DNA at the opposite end of the protein, a long-range allosteric response resembling the mechanism of activation of heterotrimeric GTPases. Magnesium influences switching in MutS by inducing faster and tighter ATP binding, allowing rapid downstream responses. MutS mutants with decreased affinity for the metal ion are impaired in fast switching and in vivo mismatch repair. Thus, the G-proteins and MutS conceptually employ the same efficient use of the high energy cofactor: slow hydrolysis in the absence of a signal and fast conversion to the active state when required.",M1
20159012,"Trichomonas vaginalis: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 17beta-estradiol alter NTPDase activity and gene expression.We investigated the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and 17beta-estradiol on NTPDase activity in fresh clinical (VP60) and long-term-grown (30236 ATCC) isolates of Trichomonas vaginalis followed by NTPDase gene transcriptional analysis. ATP hydrolysis was activated in vitro by 17beta-estradiol (0.01-1.0microM) in the VP60 isolate. Treatment for 2h with 17beta-estradiol (0.01-1microM) promoted an inhibition in nucleotide hydrolysis in the 30236 isolate whereas the 12h-treatment promoted an activation of nucleotide hydrolysis in both isolates. <e>ADP</e> hydrolysis was inhibited in vitro by 1.0-5.0microM DHEAS in the ATCC isolate. The treatment with DHEAS (0.01-1.0microM) for 2h inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis in VP60; however, during a 12h-treatment with DHEAS, nucleotide hydrolysis was inhibited in both isolates. Two NTPDase orthologous (NTPDaseA and NTPDaseB) were identified and the treatment with DHEAS for 12h was able to inhibit mRNA NTPDaseA transcript levels from the VP60. These findings demonstrate that NTPDase activity and gene expression pattern are modulated by exposure to steroids in T. vaginalis.",M1
20158267,"A fluorescent, reagentless biosensor for <e>ADP</e> based on tetramethylrhodamine-labeled ParM.Fluorescence assays for ADP detection are of considerable current interest, both in basic research and in drug discovery, as they provide a generic method for measuring the activity of ATPases and kinases. The development of a novel fluorescent biosensor is described that is based on a tetramethylrhodamine-labeled, bacterial actin homologue, ParM. The design of the biosensor takes advantage of the large conformational change of ParM on ADP binding and the strong quenching of the tetramethylrhodamine fluorescence by stacking of the dye. ParM was labeled with two tetramethylrhodamines in close proximity, whereby the fluorophores are able to interact with each other. ADP binding alters the distance and relative orientation of the tetramethylrhodamines, which leads to a change in this stacking interaction and so in the fluorescence intensity. The final ADP biosensor shows approximately 15-fold fluorescence increase in response to ADP binding. It has relatively weak affinity for ADP (K(d) = 30 microM), enabling it to be used at substoichiometric concentrations relative to ADP, while reporting ADP concentration changes in a wide range around the K(d) value, namely, submicromolar to tens of micromolar. The biosensor strongly discriminates against ATP (&gt;100-fold), allowing ADP detection against a background of millimolar ATP. At 20 degrees C, the labeled ParM binds ADP with a rate constant of 9.5 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and the complex dissociates at 2.9 s(-1). Thus, the biosensor is suitable for real-time measurements, and its performance in such assays is demonstrated using a sugar kinase and a mammalian protein kinase.",M1
20154214,"Phosphorylation of CLEC-2 is dependent on lipid rafts, actin polymerization, secondary mediators, and Rac.The C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) activates platelets through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases via a single cytoplasmic YxxL motif known as a hem immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM). Here, we demonstrate using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment that CLEC-2 translocates to lipid rafts upon ligand engagement and that translocation is essential for hemITAM phosphorylation and signal initiation. HemITAM phosphorylation, but not translocation, is also critically dependent on actin polymerization, Rac1 activation, and release of <e>ADP</e> and thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)). The role of ADP and TxA(2) in mediating phosphorylation is dependent on ligand engagement and rac activation but is independent of platelet aggregation. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the GPVI-FcRgamma-chain ITAM, which has 2 YxxL motifs, is independent of actin polymerization and secondary mediators. These results reveal a unique series of proximal events in CLEC-2 phosphorylation involving actin polymerization, secondary mediators, and Rac activation.",M1
20154092,"Real-time structural transitions are coupled to chemical steps in ATP hydrolysis by Eg5 kinesin.At the biochemical level, motor proteins are enzymatic molecules that function by converting chemical energy into mechanical motion. The key element for energy transduction and a major unresolved question common for all motor proteins is the coordination between the chemical and conformational steps in ATP hydrolysis. Here we show time-lapse monitoring of an in vitro ATP hydrolysis reaction by the motor domain of a human Kinesin-5 protein (Eg5) using difference Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV photolysis of caged ATP. In this first continuous observation of a biological reaction coordinate from substrate to product, direct spectral markers for two catalytic events are measured: proton abstraction from nucleophilic water by the catalytic base and formation of the inorganic phosphate leaving group. Simultaneous examination of conformational switching in Eg5, in parallel with catalytic steps, shows structural transitions in solution consistent with published crystal structures of the prehydrolytic and <e>ADP</e>-bound states. In addition, we detect structural modifications in the Eg5 motor domain during bond cleavage between the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP. This conclusion challenges mechanochemical models for motor proteins that utilize only two stages of the catalytic cycle to drive force and motion.",M1
20146278,"A complex of 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coenzyme A dehydratase and its activator from Clostridium difficile stabilized by aluminium tetrafluoride-adenosine diphosphate.The dehydration of 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA to isocaprenoyl-CoA is the chemically most demanding step in the reduction of leucine to isocaproate by Clostridium difficile, because the beta-hydrogen of the substrate is not acidic (pK(a) ca. 40). A two-component system, composed of a homodimeric activator and an heterodimeric dehydratase, catalyses this unusual alpha,beta-elimination of water. The reduced activator transfers an electron from its [4Fe-4S](+) cluster to that of the dehydratase in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the iron protein of nitrogenase. Here we show that AlF(4)(-) x <e>ADP</e> traps the interaction of the activator with the dehydratase by forming a stable complex containing 1.0 mol homodimeric activator, 1.0 mol heterodimeric dehydratase and 1.2 mol ADP. The complex (148 kDa) was isolated by size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography using the Strep-tag at the activator, or most conveniently by ultrafiltration (100 kDa cut off membrane). Kinetic and EPR-spectroscopic experiments revealed that the complex formation proceeds much slower than the activation but in an almost irreversible manner. The isolated complex is devoid of any activity, because the dehydratase is in the oxidized form whereas the activator remains in the reduced state due to the presence of dithionite.",M1
20145093,"Functional characterization of an extended binding component of the actin-<e>ADP</e>-ribosylating C2 toxin detected in Clostridium botulinum strain (C) 2300.Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of the binding component C2II and the enzyme component C2I, which ADP-ribosylates G-actin of eukaryotic cells. Trypsin-activated C2II (C2IIa) forms heptamers that mediate cell binding and translocation of C2I from acidic endosomes into the cytosol of target cells. By genome sequencing of C. botulinum strain (C) 2300, we found that C2II from this strain carries a C-terminal extension of 129 amino acids, unlike its homologous counterparts from strains (C) 203U28, (C) 468, and (D) 1873. This extension shows a high similarity to the C-terminal receptor-binding domain of C2II and is presumably the result of a duplication of this domain. The C2II extension facilitates the binding to cell surface receptors, which leads to an increased intoxication efficiency compared to that of C2II proteins from other C. botulinum strains.",M1
20142119,"Clopidogrel response: head-to-head comparison of different platelet assays to identify clopidogrel non responder patients after coronary stenting.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the agreement between different platelet tests to identify clopidogrel non response. BACKGROUND: Biological definition of clopidogrel non response remains controversial. Different platelet tests have been linked with recurrent ischemic events and proposed for daily practice. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the agreement of platelet tests to isolate clopidogrel non response in patients receiving high 150 mg clopidogrel maintenance dose after coronary stenting. Clopidogrel response was assessed with <e>ADP</e>-induced aggregation (ADP-Ag) (non response if &gt;70%), Platelet reactivity index VASP (PRI VASP) (non response if &gt;50%) and Verify Now Point-of-care assay (VN) (non response if PRU &gt; 240 AU). RESULTS: Seventy consecutive patients were included. The rates of non-responders were respectively: 13% (n = 9) with the ADP-Ag, 39% (n = 27) with the PRI VASP and 33% (n = 23) with the VN. We observed significant correlation between different platelet tests assessing clopidogrel response: r = 0.55 (p &lt; 0.0001) for ADP-Ag and PRI VASP, r = 0.64 (p &lt; 0.0001) for ADP-Ag and VN and r = 0.59 (p &lt; 0.0001) for PRI VASP and VN. However, using the most common thresholds, the agreement between the difference tests was poor: 0.35 for ADP-Ag and PRI VASP, 0.36 for ADP-Ag and VN and 0.46 for PRI VASP and VN. CONCLUSION: This study showed that assessment of platelet function inhibition by clopidogrel is highly test-specific. Indeed, our results demonstrated a poor agreement between different platelet assays and suggested that identification of clopidogrel non responders is test-dependent.",M1
20141757,"Conformational transitions of subunit epsilon in ATP synthase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3.Subunit epsilon of bacterial and chloroplast F(O)F(1)-ATP synthase is responsible for inhibition of ATPase activity. In Bacillus PS3 enzyme, subunit epsilon can adopt two conformations. In the  extended , inhibitory conformation, its two C-terminal alpha-helices are stretched along subunit gamma. In the  contracted , noninhibitory conformation, these helices form a hairpin. The transition of subunit epsilon from an extended to a contracted state was studied in ATP synthase incorporated in Bacillus PS3 membranes at 59 degrees C. Fluorescence energy resonance transfer between fluorophores introduced in the C-terminus of subunit epsilon and in the N-terminus of subunit gamma was used to follow the conformational transition in real time. It was found that ATP induced the conformational transition from the extended to the contracted state (half-maximum transition extent at 140 microM ATP). <e>ADP</e> could neither prevent nor reverse the ATP-induced conformational change, but it did slow it down. Acid residues in the DELSEED region of subunit beta were found to stabilize the extended conformation of epsilon. Binding of ATP directly to epsilon was not essential for the ATP-induced conformational change. The ATP concentration necessary for the half-maximal transition (140 microM) suggests that subunit epsilon probably adopts the extended state and strongly inhibits ATP hydrolysis only when the intracellular ATP level drops significantly below the normal value.",M1
20139897,"Repurposing an old drug for a new use: glybenclamide exerts antiplatelet activity by interacting with the thromboxane A(2) receptor.AIM: To investigate the potential antagonistic activity of the antidiabetic agent glybenclamide for the human platelet thromboxane A(2) receptor (abbreviated as TPR). METHODS: Platelets were obtained from healthy donors. Aggregation studies were performed in a model 700 aggregometry system. Radioactivity was counted in a Beckman LS 6000 liquid scintillation counter and calcium imaging was performed using an LS50B PerkinElmer Fluorescence Spectrometer. RESULTS: It was found that glybenclamide: 1) inhibited aggregation induced by the TPR agonist U46619 (IC(50)=2.3+/-0.31 micromol/L) and by the thromboxane A(2) precursor arachidonic acid (IC(50)=2.6+/-0.24 micromol/L); 2) displaced SQ29,548 from its binding sites on platelets; 3) lacked any detectable effects on aggregation stimulated by <e>ADP</e>, or the thrombin receptor activating-peptide 4; 4) blocked calcium mobilization induced by U46619, but not by ADP; and 5) failed to raise cAMP levels.

Thus, glybenclamide or a rationally designed derivative has the potential to serve as an antithrombotic agent.",M1
20138257,"A kinetic study on the chemical cleavage of nucleoside diphosphate sugars.Nucleoside diphosphate sugars serve in essential roles in metabolic processes. They have, therefore, been used in mechanistic studies on glycosylation reactions, and their analogues have been synthesised as enzyme and receptor inhibitors. Despite extensive biochemical research, little is known about their chemical reactions. In the present work the chemical cleavage of two different types of nucleoside diphosphate sugars has been studied. UDP-Glc is phosphorylated at the anomeric carbon, whereas in <e>ADP</e>-Rib C-1 is unsubstituted, allowing hence the equilibrium between cyclic hemiacetal and acyclic carbonyl forms. Due to the structural difference, these substrates react via different pathways under slightly alkaline conditions: while UDP-Glc reacts exclusively by a nucleophilic attack of a glucose hydroxyl group on the diphosphate moiety, ADP-Rib undergoes a complex reaction sequence that involves isomerisation processes of the acyclic ribose sugar and results in a release of ADP.",M1
20135752,"Might platelet-leucocyte complexes be playing a role in major vascular involvement of Behçet's disease? A comparative study.We determined platelet-leucocyte complexes, which play roles in the thrombosis-inflammation relationship, in Behçet's disease patients with and without major vascular involvement (MVI) and in healthy controls. We included 36 Behçet's disease patients (22 male, 14 female, mean age: 34.4 +/- 8.3 years) and 20 healthy individuals (14 male, six female, mean age: 31.8 +/- 4.4 years). Whole blood count, CRP and ESR were determined in both groups. Clinical data about the patients were obtained from medical charts. Individuals with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and smokers were excluded. Behçet's disease patients with MVI were taken as a separate group (8 male, 5 female, mean age: 37 +/- 8 years). MVI was defined as the presence of pulmonary arterial aneurysm, deep venous thrombosis, vena cava inferior or superior thrombosis, or venous sinus thrombosis. Flow cytometry was used to determine platelet-monocyte complexes (PMC), platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNC), basal and adenosine diphosphate (<e>ADP</e>)-stimulated platelet CD62P expression. Behçet's disease patients with MVI had significantly higher PNC than Behçet's disease patients without MVI and healthy controls (P values = 0.01). PMC levels in Behçet's disease patients with MVI were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P = 0.01). The groups were similar in basal and ADP-stimulated platelet CD62P expression (P values &gt;0.05). Basal and ADP-stimulated CD62P expression, PMC and PNC were not significantly different between active Behçet's disease versus inactive Behçet's disease patients. The evaluated parameters were similar in Behçet's disease patients with and without uveitis, and pathergy-positive and pathergy-negative groups. Our results might suggest that the formation of PMC and PNC might play a role in thrombosis and MVI of Behçet's disease.",M1
20135061,"Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and platelet reactivity after treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome.Platelet response to clopidogrel shows inter-individual variability that is partially explained by genetic polymorphisms. This variability affects clinical outcome when clopidogrel is administered in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Catecholamines, released during ACS, contribute to platelet aggregation through platelet alpha2A-(alpha2A-AR) and beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) stimulation. It was the objective of this study to assess the potential influence of alpha2A-AR and beta2-AR gene polymorphisms on platelet reactivity after dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in ACS. We screened 641 ACS patients for 6.3/6.7 kb alpha2A-AR polymorphism, and for Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu beta2-AR polymorphism. After 600 mg clopidogrel, we assessed <e>ADP</e> 10 micromol-induced platelet aggregation (ADP-Ag) and vasoactive stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). All single nucleotide polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A slight though negligible association was found between 6.3 kb allele of alpha2A-AR with platelet reactivity ADP-Ag induced (beta: -2.91 [-5.68;-0.14], p=0.04). A borderline not significant reduction in PRI VASP was observed in 6.3 kb alpha2A-AR carriers (beta: -3.81 [-0.09;7.72], p=0.06). No significant effect on platelet parameters was observed for the other tested polymorphisms. Common alpha2A- and beta2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms do not show any major impact on residual platelet reactivity in non-ST-elevation ACS when a dual antiplatelet therapy with 250 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel is administered.",M1
20133809,"Influence of lever structure on myosin 5a walking.Using electron microscopy and image processing, we have observed myosin 5a modified with lever arms of different lengths (four, six, and eight calmodulin-binding IQ domains) and orientations walking along actin filaments. Step lengths were dependent on lever length: 8IQ &gt; 6IQ &gt; 4IQ, which is consistent with myosin 5a having evolved to walk straight along actin. Lead heads were mostly in the prepowerstroke state, tethered there by the trail head. However, improved image processing showed that in 5-10% of molecules the lead motor was in the postpowerstroke state. This is a unique attached state of myosin, where the motor domain has completed its powerstroke at the expense of severe lever distortion, but with little cargo movement. Postpowerstroke lead heads were seen in both wild-type and modified lever molecules, mostly where there was least strain. These data allow the strain dependence of the equilibrium between pre- and postpowerstroke conformations to be measured. Slow rates of <e>ADP</e> dissociation observed from lead heads of these molecules can be explained by the unfavorable equilibrium between the pre- and postpowerstroke conformations preceding ADP loss.",M1
20125064,"Trophic molecules derived from human mesenchymal stem cells enhance survival, function, and angiogenesis of isolated islets after transplantation.BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also known as multipotent progenitor cells, release several factors that support cell survival and enhance wound healing. We hypothesized that MSC-secreted molecules would induce a trophic effect in pancreatic islet culture conditions. METHODS: Pancreatic islets were co-cultured with MSCs, and <e>ADP</e>/ATP ratios, glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and DNA fragmentation were evaluated to measure islet quality and viability in vitro. The induction of signal molecules related to the control of survival, function, and angiogenesis was also analyzed. Cell quality assays, DNA fragmentation assays, and islet transplantation into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were performed using MSC-conditioned medium (CM)-cultured islets. Furthermore, we identified soluble molecules within MSC-CM. RESULTS: Islets co-cultured with MSCs demonstrated lower ADP/ATP ratios, and higher GSIS indexes and viability. Furthermore, co-cultured islets revealed higher levels of anti-apoptotic signal molecules (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and heat shock protein-32) and demonstrated increased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and Tie-2 mRNA expression and increased levels of phosphorylated Tie-2 and focal adhesion kinase protein. Islets cultured in MSC-CM demonstrated lower ADP/ATP ratios, less apoptosis, and a higher GSIS indexes. Diabetic mice that received islet transplants (200 islet equivalent) cultured in MSC-CM for 48 hr demonstrated significantly lower blood glucose levels and enhanced blood vessel formation. In addition, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta were detected at significant levels in MSC-CM. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the trophic factors secreted by human MSCs enhance islet survival and function after transplantation.",M1
20124694,"Structures of human MST3 kinase in complex with adenine, <e>ADP</e> and Mn2+.The MST family is a subclass of mammalian serine/threonine kinases that are related to the yeast sterile-20 protein and are implicated in regulating cell growth and transformation. The MST3 protein contains a 300-residue catalytic domain and a 130-residue regulatory domain, which can be cleaved by caspase and activated by autophosphorylation, promoting apoptosis. Here, five crystal structures of the catalytic domain of MST3 are presented, including a complex with ADP and manganese, a unique cofactor preferred by the enzyme, and a complex with adenine. Similar to other protein kinases, the catalytic domain of MST3 folds into two lobes: the smaller N lobe forms the nucleotide-binding site and the larger C lobe recognizes the polypeptide substrate. The bound ADP and Mn(2+) ions are covered by a glycine-rich loop and held in place by Asn149 and Asp162. A different orientation was observed for the ligand in the MST3-adenine complex. In the activation loop, the side chain of Thr178 is phosphorylated and is sandwiched by Arg143 and Arg176. Comparison of this structure with other similar kinase structures shows a 180 degrees rotation of the loop, leading to activation of the enzyme. The well defined protein-ligand interactions also provide useful information for the design of potent inhibitors.",M1
20121703,"Denatured proteins facilitate the formation of the football-shaped GroEL-(GroES)2 complex.Controversy exists over whether the chaperonin GroEL forms a GroEL-(GroES)2 complex (football-shaped complex) during its reaction cycle. We have revealed previously the existence of the football-shaped complex in the chaperonin reaction cycle using a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assay [Sameshima, Ueno, Iizuka, Ishii, Terada, Okabe and Funatsu (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 23765-23773]. Although denatured proteins alter the ATPase activity of GroEL and the dynamics of the GroEL-GroES interaction, the effect of denatured proteins on the formation of the football-shaped complex has not been characterized. In the present study, a FRET assay was used to demonstrate that denatured proteins facilitate the formation of the football-shaped complex. The presence of denatured proteins was also found to increase the rate of association of GroES to the trans-ring of GroEL. Furthermore, denatured proteins decrease the inhibitory influence of <e>ADP</e> on ATP-induced association of GroES to the trans-ring of GroEL. From these findings we conclude that denatured proteins facilitate the dissociation of ADP from the trans-ring of GroEL and the concomitant association of ATP and the second GroES.",M1
20118150,"Adding cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy achieves greater platelet inhibition than high maintenance dose clopidogrel in patients with acute myocardial infarction: Results of the adjunctive cilostazol versus high maintenance dose clopidogrel in patients with AMI (ACCEL-AMI) study.BACKGROUND: Optimal platelet inhibition is an important therapeutic adjunct in patients acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing coronary stenting. Whether adjunctive cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy (triple antiplatelet therapy) can inhibit enhanced platelet reactivity in patients with AMI yet has not been determined. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of platelet inhibition by triple antiplatelet therapy in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immediately after emergency room arrival, patients with AMI received clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg daily) and aspirin (300-mg loading dose and 200 mg daily throughout the study period). After patients underwent coronary stenting (n=90), they were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups before discharge: standard group, clopidogrel of 75 mg daily (n=30); high maintenance dose (MD) group, clopidogrel of 150 mg daily (n=30); and triple group, adjunctive cilostazol of 100 mg twice daily to clopidogrel of 75 mg daily (n=30). Platelet reactivity was assessed at predischarge and 30-day follow-up by conventional aggregometry and the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. Predischarge platelet reactivities were similar in the 3 groups. At 30-day follow-up, inhibition of maximal aggregation with 20 microM <e>ADP</e> stimuli was 6.0% in the standard group, 19.1% in the high-MD group, and 42.4% in the triple group (P&lt;0.001), whereas inhibition of late aggregation with 20microM ADP stimuli was 10.8%, 38.1%, and 66.4%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Similar results were demonstrated when 5 microM ADP was used. Furthermore, percent changes of P2Y12 reaction unit were significantly different among regimens (10.6% in the standard group, 30.7% in the high-MD group, and 43.0% in the triple group; P&lt;0.001). With respect to high-postclopidogrel platelet reactivity (prespecified as 20 microM ADP-induced maximal aggregation &gt;50% of light transmission), fewer patients in the triple group (13.3%) met the criteria as compared with those in the standard (76.7%) and high-MD groups (56.7%) at 30-day follow-up (P&lt;0.001). In the triple group, there were more potent and consistent platelet inhibitions by all parameters as compared with the high-MD group except for percent changes of P2Y12 reaction unit (P=0.071). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AMI undergoing coronary stenting, triple antiplatelet therapy results in a greater antiplatelet effect at 30 days as compared with a high-MD clopidogrel or standard dual antiplatelet therapy.",M1
20082989,"Differential regulation of microglial motility by ATP/<e>ADP</e> and adenosine.Microglia are motile immune-competent cells of the central nervous system. They assume a highly branched morphology and monitor the brain parenchyma under physiological conditions. In the presence of injury, microglia retract their branching processes, migrate to the site of injury, and help clear cellular debris by phagocytosis. This response appears to be mediated in part by ATP released at the site of injury. Here, we review the evidence for the involvement of ATP and the purinergic P2Y(12) receptor in microglial process extension and chemoattraction to injury. We subsequently discuss recent findings regarding a switch of this chemotactic response to ATP in activated, or proinflammatory, microglia. Specifically, in LPS-activated microglia, ATP induces process retraction and repulsive migration, effects opposite to those seen in unstimulated cells. These repulsive effects of ATP are mediated by the G(s)-coupled adenosine A(2A) receptor and depend on the breakdown of ATP to adenosine. Thus, ATP-induced repulsion by activated microglia involves upregulation of the adenosine A(2A) receptor and coincident downregulation of the P2Y(12) receptor. The roles of the A(2A) receptor in brain pathologies such as Parkinson's disease and ischemia are also examined. We propose that the effects of A(2A) receptor antagonists on brain injury may be in part due to the inactivation of A(2A) on activated microglia.",M1
20108211,"Pyridoxine increases nitric oxide biosynthesis in human platelets.Activation and aggregation of platelets are key events in the pathophysiology of thrombotic diseases. There is increasing evidence that platelet-derived nitric oxide (NO) exerts important anti-platelet actions. Pyridoxine may have beneficial therapeutic effects in cardiovascular disease states, and has previously been shown to increase endothelial NO biosynthesis. The aims of the present study were firstly to determine in vitro whether pyridoxine can increase platelet NO synthesis, and secondly to investigate the mechanism by which it does this. Platelets isolated from blood taken from healthy subjects were treated with pyridoxine or vehicle. Platelet aggregation was measured by Born aggregometry. Intraplatelet cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP, an index of bioactive NO) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Serine-1177-specific phosphorylation of NO synthase type 3 (NOS-3) and phosphorylation of protein kinase Akt were determined in platelets by Western blotting. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity in platelets was ascertained by homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. Our results showed that pyridoxine largely inhibited the aggregation of platelets in response to adenosine diphosphate (<e>ADP</e>) or thrombin and increased bioactive NO. It also increased NOS-3 phosphorylation on serine-1177, and increased Akt serine phosphorylation. PI3K activity was augmented by pyridoxine, an effect inhibited by the specific PI3K antagonist LY294002. In conclusion, pyridoxine is effective in elevating platelet NO biosynthesis, through improving PI3K activity and hence downstream Akt phosphorylation, and in turn serine-1177 phosphorylation of NOS-3. These data reveal a novel mechanism by which NOS-3 activity can be regulated in platelets.",M1
20105027,"Comparison of the luminescent <e>ADP</e>-Glo assay to a standard radiometric assay for measurement of protein kinase activity.Many assay technologies have been developed and utilized to efficiently assay and screen against protein kinase targets. The radiometric assay format for assaying the protein kinase targets has been considered the  Gold Standard  format since it allows the direct readout of kinase functional activity and is a universal assay that is highly sensitive. However, the hazardous nature of the radiometric assay together with the regulatory hurdles has led to the development of alternative assay formats for assessing protein kinase activity measurements. The luminescent ADP-Glo assay has been developed as an alternative to radiometric format for assaying protein kinase targets. This assay allows the measurement of the ADP product formed during the kinase reaction. Therefore, the luminescent ADP-Glo assay is similar to the radiometric format in that it measures the direct product of the protein kinase reaction. Furthermore, since the ADP product is generated by all protein kinase reactions, this is a universal format that can be used for assaying any given protein kinase target. Analysis of data generated with multiple protein kinase targets and the luminescent ADP-Glo technology shows comparable results to the radiometric assay format. Therefore, the luminescent ADP-Glo assay is a robust new technology for evaluating catalytic function of protein kinases as well as other ATPases.",M1
20105026,"<e>ADP</e>-Glo: A Bioluminescent and homogeneous ADP monitoring assay for kinases.ADP-Glo is a novel bioluminescent, homogeneous assay for monitoring ADP producing biochemical reactions and thus it is an ideal assay for detecting enzyme activity using a wide variety of substrates. It is a universal assay that can be used with protein kinases, lipid kinases, sugar kinases, and many more kinases as well as ATPases. Because of its high sensitivity, it is suitable for monitoring enzyme activities at very early substrate conversions requiring very low amount of enzymes. Furthermore, as the assay is applicable to a broad range of ATP and substrate concentrations, it is optimal for enzymes that require high ATP and substrate concentrations. This is critical since inhibitor potency has to be demonstrated at the cellular level where ATP is present at millimolar concentrations. ADP-Glo is performed in 2 steps upon completion of kinase reaction: a combined termination of kinase reaction and depletion of remaining ATP in the first step, and conversion of generated ADP to ATP and the newly produced ATP to light output using luciferase/luciferin reaction in the second step. The luminescent signal generated is proportional to the ADP concentration produced and is correlated with the kinase activity. Due to its high signal to background and luminescent readout, this assay is less susceptible to generation of false hits and thus it is applicable to not only primary and secondary screening but also kinase profiling.",M1
20102488,"A new role for the A2b adenosine receptor in regulating platelet function.BACKGROUND: Activation of platelets is a critical component of atherothrombosis and plays a central role in the progression of unstable cardiovascular syndromes. Adenosine, acting through adenosine receptors, increases intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits platelet aggregation. The A2a adenosine receptor has already been recognized as a mediator of adenosine-dependent effects on platelet aggregation, and here we present a new role for the A2b adenosine receptor (A2bAR) in this process. METHODS AND RESULTS: As compared with platelets from wild-type controls, platelets derived from A2bAR knockout mice have significantly greater <e>ADP</e> receptor activation-induced aggregation. Although mouse megakaryocytes and platelets express low levels of the A2bAR transcript, this gene is highly upregulated following injury and systemic inflammation in vivo. Under these conditions, A2bAR-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation significantly increases. Our studies also identify a novel mechanism by which the A2bAR could regulate platelet aggregation; namely, ablation of the A2bAR leads to upregulated expression of the P2Y1 ADP receptor, whereas A2bAR-mediated or direct elevation of cAMP has the opposite effect. Thus, the A2bAR regulates platelet function beyond mediating the immediate effect of adenosine on aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these investigations show for the first time that the platelet A2bAR is upregulated under stress in vivo, plays a significant role in regulating ADP receptor expression, and inhibits agonist-induced platelet aggregation.",M1
20100539,"Iron transport by proteoliposomes containing mitochondrial F(1)F(0) ATP synthase isolated from rat heart.In this work, we present evidence of Fe(2+) transport by rat heart mitochondrial F(1)F(0) ATP synthase. Iron uptake by the vesicles containing the enzyme was concentration- and temperature-dependent, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C. Both ATP and <e>ADP</e> stimulated iron uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas AMP, AMPPCP, and mADP did not. Inhibitors of the enzyme, oligomycin, and resveratrol similarly blocked iron transport. The iron uptake was confirmed by inhibition using specific antibodies against the alpha, beta, and c subunits of the enzyme. Interestingly, slight transport of common divalent and trivalent metal ions such as Mg(+2), Ca(+2), Mn(+2), Zn(+2), Cu(+2), Fe(+3), and Al(+3) was observed. Moreover, Cu(+2), even in the nM range, inhibited iron uptake and attained maximum inhibition of approximately 56%. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the medium exerted an opposite effect depending on the type of adenosine nucleotide, which was suppressed with ATP, but enhanced with ADP. A similarly stimulating effect of ATP and ADP with an inverse effect of Pi suggests that the activity of ATPase and ATP synthase may be associated with iron uptake in a different manner, probably via antiport of H(+).",M1
20097289,"Two-pore potassium ion channels are inhibited by both G(q/11)- and G(i)-coupled P2Y receptors.Two-pore potassium (K(2P)) ion channels and P2Y receptors modulate the activity of neurones and are targets for the treatment of neuronal disorders. Here we have characterised their interaction. In cells coexpressing the Galpha(i)-coupled hP2Y(12) receptor, <e>ADP</e> and ATP significantly inhibited hK(2P)2.1 currents. This was abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX), the hP2Y(12) antagonist AR-C69931MX, the hP2Y(1) antagonist MRS2179 and by mutating potential PKA/PKC phosphorylation sites in the channel C terminal. In cells coexpressing the Galpha(q/11)-coupled hP2Y(1) receptor, ADP and ATP also inhibited hK(2P)2.1 currents, which were abolished by MRS2179, but unaffected by AR-C69931MX and PTX. When both receptors were coexpressed with K(2P)2.1 channels, ADP-induced inhibition was antagonised by AR-C69913MX and MRS2179, but not PTX. Thus, both Galpha(q/11)- and Galpha(i)-coupled P2Y receptors inhibit K(2P) channels and the action of hP2Y(12) receptors appears to involve co-activation of endogenous hP2Y(1) receptors. This represents a novel mechanism by which P2Y receptors may modulate neuronal activity.",M1

20089865,"The Escherichia coli PriA helicase specifically recognizes gapped DNA substrates: effect of the two nucleotide-binding sites of the enzyme on the recognition process.Energetics and specificity of interactions between the Escherichia coli PriA helicase and the gapped DNAs have been studied, using the quantitative fluorescence titration and analytical ultracentrifugation methods. The gap complex has a surprisingly low minimum total site size, corresponding to approximately 7 nucleotides of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), as compared with the site size of approximately 20 nucleotides of the enzyme-ssDNA complex. The dramatic difference in stoichiometries indicates that the enzyme predominantly engages the strong DNA-binding subsite in interactions with the gap and assumes a very different orientation in the gap complex, as compared with the complex with the ssDNA. The helicase binds the ssDNA gaps with 4-5 nucleotides with the highest affinity, which is approximately 3 and approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than the affinities for the ssDNA and double-stranded DNA, respectively. In the gap complex, the protein does not engage in cooperative interactions with the enzyme predominantly associated with the surrounding dsDNA. Binding of nucleoside triphosphate to the strong and weak nucleotide-binding sites of the helicase eliminates the selectivity of the enzyme for the size of the gap, whereas saturation of both sites with <e>ADP</e> leads to amplified affinity for the ssDNA gap containing 5 nucleotides and engagement of an additional protein area in interactions with the nucleic acid.",M1
20089714,"The direct molecular effects of fatigue and myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation on the actomyosin contractile apparatus.Skeletal muscle, during periods of exertion, experiences several different fatigue-based changes in contractility, including reductions in force, velocity, power output, and energy usage. The fatigue-induced changes in contractility stem from many different factors, including alterations in the levels of metabolites, oxidative damage, and phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). Here, we measured the direct molecular effects of fatigue-like conditions on actomyosin's unloaded sliding velocity using the in vitro motility assay. We examined how changes in ATP, <e>ADP</e>, P(i), and pH affect the ability of the myosin to translocate actin and whether the effects of each individual molecular species are additive. We found that the primary causes of the reduction in unloaded sliding velocity are increased [ADP] and lowered pH and that the combined effects of the molecular species are nonadditive. Furthermore, since an increase in RLC phosphorylation is often associated with fatigue, we examined the differential effects of myosin RLC phosphorylation and fatigue on actin filament velocity. We found that phosphorylation of the RLC causes a 22% depression in sliding velocity. On the other hand, RLC phosphorylation ameliorates the slowing of velocity under fatigue-like conditions. We also found that phosphorylation of the myosin RLC increases actomyosin affinity for ADP, suggesting a kinetic role for RLC phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that ADP binding to skeletal muscle is load dependent, consistent with the existence of a load-dependent isomerization of the ADP bound state.",M1
20087952,"Usefulness of delta value of platelet parameters on ADVIA 120 for the functional reactivity of stored platelets.An agonist-induced expression of CD62P by flow cytometry analysis for evaluating platelet functional reactivity has some disadvantages. We investigated the usefulness of platelet parameters by ADVIA 120 to predict an agonist-induced expression of CD62P in stored platelets. The CD62P expression by flow cytometry and the platelet parameters by ADVIA 120 were studied in samples from 27 platelet pheresis products. Delta (Delta) values were calculated as the degree of change of the platelet parameters studied with or without adenosine 5'-diphosphate sodium (<e>ADP</e>) stimulation. The CD62P expression of the ADP-activated platelets were correlated with the Delta platelet count (r=0.517) in the short-term storage group (within 10 hr from preparation), with the platelet component distribution width (PCDW) without ADP (r=-0.744) and the DeltaPCDW (r=-0.755) in the long-term storage group (after 10 hr from preparation). Therefore, the delta values of platelet parameters on ADVIA 120 analysis in platelets between with and without ADP stimulation could be useful as a simple predictor for the functional reactivity of stored platelets.",M1
20087341,"Control of ATP homeostasis during the respiro-fermentative transition in yeast.Respiring Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells respond to a sudden increase in glucose concentration by a pronounced drop of their adenine nucleotide content ([ATP]+[<e>ADP</e>]+[AMP]=[AXP]). The unknown fate of 'lost' AXP nucleotides represented a long-standing problem for the understanding of the yeast's physiological response to changing growth conditions. Transient accumulation of the purine salvage pathway intermediate, inosine, accounted for the apparent loss of adenine nucleotides. Conversion of AXPs into inosine was facilitated by AMP deaminase, Amd1, and IMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase, Isn1. Inosine recycling into the AXP pool was facilitated by purine nucleoside phosphorylase, Pnp1, and joint action of the phosphoribosyltransferases, Hpt1 and Xpt1. Analysis of changes in 24 intracellular metabolite pools during the respiro-fermentative growth transition in wild-type, amd1, isn1, and pnp1 strains revealed that only the amd1 mutant exhibited significant deviations from the wild-type behavior. Moreover, mutants that were blocked in inosine production exhibited delayed growth acceleration after glucose addition. It is proposed that interconversion of adenine nucleotides and inosine facilitates rapid and energy-cost efficient adaptation of the AXP pool size to changing environmental conditions.",M1
20085435,"Prostacyclin receptor stimulation facilitates detection of human platelet P2Y(12) receptor inhibition by the PFA-100 system.The rationale for monitoring platelet inhibition by thienopyridines for the identification of patients at risk for future recurrent arterial thrombosis or ischemic events is intensively discussed, as well as which monitoring systems are appropriate, robust and reliable. Flow cytometric measurement of phosphorylated VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), expressed as platelet reactivity index (PRI), is presently  the gold standard method  for evaluating P2Y(12) receptor inhibition. The PFA-100 system, a commercially available and clinically widely used platelet test system, is based on a different principle, not that of VASP phosphorylation. The aim of the present study was to compare the two methods and evaluate whether the conventional PFA-100 collagen/<e>ADP</e> cartridge could be pharmacologically improved to enable its routine clinical use for detection of platelet P2Y(12) receptor inhibition. The effects of increasing concentrations of the competitive P2Y(12) receptor antagonist cangrelor (AR-C69931MX) and the time-dependent effects of a single oral loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg) were analysed with human whole blood. P2Y(12) receptor inhibition was measured by the VASP/PRI assay and the PFA-100 collagen/ADP cartridge system, with and without preincubation with the prostacyclin analog iloprost (Ilomedin). In vitro addition of iloprost (0.5 nM) enabled PFA-100 collagen/ADP cartridge system detection of P2Y(12) receptor inhibition in whole blood by cangrelor in vitro or by clopidogrel treatment of volunteers. The addition of a prostacyclin analog facilitates PFA-100 collagen/ADP system detection of P2Y(12) receptor inhibition, achieving a sensitivity similar to that of the VASP/PRI reference method. Future studies should now evaluate whether this modified PFA-100 system, like the VASP assay, is a reliable test system for monitoring P2Y(12) receptor inhibition under clinical conditions.",M1

ATP hydrolysis in the GroES-bound (cis) ring gates entry of ATP into the opposite unoccupied trans ring, which allosterically ejects cis ligands. While earlier studies suggested that hydrolysis of cis ATP is the rate-limiting step of the cycle (t1/2 approximately 10 s), a recent study suggested that ADP release from the cis ring may be rate-limiting (t1/2 approximately 15-20 s). Here we have measured ADP release using a coupled enzyme assay and observed a t1/2 for release of &lt;or=4-5 s, indicating that this is not the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle.",M1
20082212,"The effect of NBD-Cl in nucleotide-binding of the major subunit alpha and B of the motor proteins F1FO ATP synthase and A1AO ATP synthase.Subunit alpha of the Escherichia coli F(1)F(O) ATP synthase has been produced, and its low-resolution structure has been determined. The monodispersity of alpha allowed the studies of nucleotide-binding and inhibitory effect of 4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl) to ATP/<e>ADP</e>-binding. Binding constants (K ( d )) of 1.6 microM of bound MgATP-ATTO-647N and 2.9 microM of MgADP-ATTO-647N have been determined from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data. A concentration of 51 microM and 55 microM of NBD-Cl dropped the MgATP-ATTO-647N and MgADP-ATTO-647N binding capacity to 50% (IC(50)), respectively. In contrast, no effect was observed in the presence of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. As subunit alpha is the homologue of subunit B of the A(1)A(O) ATP synthase, the interaction of NBD-Cl with B of the A-ATP synthase from Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 has also been shown. The data reveal a reduction of nucleotide-binding of B due to NBD-Cl, resulting in IC(50) values of 41 microM and 42 microM for MgATP-ATTO-647N and MgADP-ATTO-647N, respectively.",M1
20080715,"Three conformational snapshots of the hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase reveal a ratchet translocation mechanism.A virally encoded superfamily-2 (SF2) helicase (NS3h) is essential for the replication of hepatitis C virus, a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. Efforts to elucidate the function of NS3h and to develop inhibitors against it, however, have been hampered by limited understanding of its molecular mechanism. Here we show x-ray crystal structures for a set of NS3h complexes, including ground-state and transition-state ternary complexes captured with ATP mimics (<e>ADP</e>.BeF(3) and ). These structures provide, for the first time, three conformational snapshots demonstrating the molecular basis of action for a SF2 helicase. Upon nucleotide binding, overall domain rotation along with structural transitions in motif V and the bound DNA leads to the release of one base from the substrate base-stacking row and the loss of several interactions between NS3h and the 3' DNA segment. As nucleotide hydrolysis proceeds into the transition state, stretching of a  spring  helix and another overall conformational change couples rearrangement of the (d)NTPase active site to additional hydrogen-bonding between NS3h and DNA. Together with biochemistry, these results demonstrate a  ratchet  mechanism involved in the unidirectional translocation and define the step size of NS3h as one base per nucleotide hydrolysis cycle. These findings suggest feasible strategies for developing specific inhibitors to block the action of this attractive, yet largely unexplored drug target.",M1
20078127,"Energetics of nucleotide-induced DnaK conformational states.Hsp70 chaperones are molecular switches that use the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to modulate their affinity for protein substrates and, most likely, to remodel non-native interactions allowing proper substrate folding. By means of isothermal titration calorimetry, we have measured the thermodynamics of ATP and <e>ADP</e> binding to (i) wild-type DnaK, the main bacterial Hsp70; (ii) two single-point mutants, DnaK(T199A), which lacks ATPase activity but maintains conformational changes similar to those observed in the wild-type protein, and DnaK(R151A), defective in interdomain communication; and iii) two deletion mutants, the isolated nucleotide binding domain (K-NBD) and a DeltaLid construct [DnaK(1-507)]. At 25 degrees C, ATP binding to DnaK results in a fast endothermic and a slow exothermic process due to ATP hydrolysis. We demonstrate that the endothermic event is due to the allosteric coupling between ATP binding to the nucleotide binding domain and the conformational rearrangement of the substrate binding domain. The interpretation of our data is compatible with domain docking upon ATP binding and shows that this conformational change carries an energy penalty of ca. 1 kcal/mol. The conformational energy stored in the ATP-bound DnaK state, together with the free energy of ATP hydrolysis, can be used in remodeling bound substrates.",M1
20067476,"The ecto-nucleotidase NTPDase1 differentially regulates P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptor-dependent vasorelaxation.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracellular nucleotides produce vasodilatation through endothelial P2 receptor activation. As these autacoids are actively metabolized by the ecto-nucleotidase nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1), we studied the effects of this cell surface enzyme on nucleotide-dependent vasodilatation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Vascular NTPDase expression and activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry. The vascular effects of nucleotides were tested in vivo by monitoring mean arterial pressure, and in vitro comparing reactivity of aortic rings using wild-type and Entpd1(-/-) (lacking NTPDase1) mice. KEY RESULTS: The absence of NTPDase1 in Entpd1(-/-) mice led to a dramatic drop in endothelial nucleotidase activity. This deficit was associated with an exacerbated decrease in blood pressure after nucleotide injection. Following ATP injection, mean arterial pressure was decreased in Entpd1(+/+) and Entpd1(-/-) mice by 5.0 and 17%, respectively, and by 0.1 and 19% after UTP injection (10 nmole.kg(-1) both). In vitro, the concentration-response curves of relaxation to <e>ADP</e> and ATP were shifted to the left, revealing a facilitation of endothelial P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptor activation in Entpd1(-/-) mice. EC(50) values in Entpd1(+/+) versus Entpd1(-/-) aortic rings were 14 microM versus 0.35 microM for ADP, and 29 microM versus 1 microM for ATP. In Entpd1(-/-) aortas, P2Y1 receptors were more extensively desensitized than P2Y2 receptors. Relaxations to the non-hydrolysable analogues ADPbetaS (P2Y1) and ATPgammaS (P2Y2) were equivalent in both genotypes confirming the normal functionality of these P2Y receptors in mutant mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: NTPDase1 controls endothelial P2Y receptor-dependent relaxation, regulating both agonist level and P2 receptor reactivity.",M1
20064527,"Crystal structure of the ATP-dependent maturation factor of Ni,Fe-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases.CooC proteins are ATPases involved in the incorporation of nickel into the complex active site ([Ni-4Fe-4S]) cluster of Ni,Fe-dependent carbon monoxide dehydrogenases. The genome of the carboxydotrophic bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans encodes five carbon monoxide dehydrogenases and three CooC-type proteins, of which CooC1 was shown to be a nickel-binding ATPase. We determined the crystal structure of CooC1 in four different states: empty, <e>ADP</e>-bound, Zn(2+)/ADP-bound, and Zn(2+)-bound. The structure of CooC1 consists of two spatially separated functional modules: an ATPase module containing the deviant Walker A motif and a metal-binding module that confers the specific function of CooC1. The ATPase module is homologous to other members of the MinD family and, in analogy to the dimeric structure of ATP-bound Soj, is likely responsible for the ATP-dependent dimerization of CooC1. Its core topology classifies CooC1 as a member of the MinD family of SIMIBI (signal recognition particle, MinD and BioD)-class NTPases. The crystal structure of Zn(2+)-bound CooC1 reveals a conserved C-X-C motif as the metal-binding site responsible for metal-induced dimerization. The competitive binding of Ni(2+) and Zn(2+) to CooC1 in solution confirms that the conserved C-X-C motif is also responsible for the interaction with Ni(2+). A comparison of the different CooC1 structures determined suggests a mutual dependence of metal-binding site and nucleotide-binding site.",M1
20063989,"The effect of P2Y-mediated platelet activation on the release of VEGF and endostatin from platelets.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin are key protein modulators of angiogenesis found within platelets. The platelet activation pathways that control angiogenic protein release are incompletely elucidated. The differential release of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic proteins from the platelet has been demonstrated for proteinase activated receptors (PARs). Given the ability of tumors to secrete <e>ADP</e> and the availability of ADP receptor antagonists clinically, we determined the influence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the ADP receptors, P2Y(1) and P2Y(12), on platelet release of the angiogenic stimulator protein, VEGF, and the angiogenic inhibitor protein, endostatin. Minimally altered whole blood (WB) and platelet rich plasma (PRP) from healthy volunteers was stimulated with ADP alone (12.5 uM), in combination with a P2Y(1) antagonist (MRS2179) or a P2Y(12) antagonist (cangrelor). VEGF and endostatin protein concentrations were assessed by an ELISA assay. We report that maximally stimulating concentrations of ADP significantly increased VEGF release from platelets in both PRP and WB by 36+/-12% 36+/-12% 54+/-18% 36 +/- 12% (p &lt; 0.05) respectively as compared to control. Both P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) receptor antagonism inhibited this release. Conversely, endostatin levels did not change following ADP stimulation in PRP, while a 4.7% (p = 0.03) increase was observed in WB. As compared to thrombin receptor activation, ADP activation was a weaker stimulus for VEGF release. We found that activation of platelets by ADP results in an increase in soluble VEGF concentrations with minimal effects on endostatin concentrations, suggesting ADP release in the tumor microenvironment may be, on balance, proangiogenic. P2Y receptor antagonism abrogates ADP mediated proangiogenic protein release and thus may represent a potential pharmacologic strategy for regulating platelet mediated angiogenesis.",M1
20062936,"Prasugrel compared with high-dose clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome. The randomised, double-blind ACAPULCO study.Compared with the approved dose regimen of clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose [LD], 75-mg maintenance dose [MD]), prasugrel has been demonstrated to reduce ischaemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In ACS, antiplatelet effects of a prasugrel MD regimen have not been previously compared with either a higher clopidogrel MD or after switching from a higher clopidogrel LD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiplatelet effect of a prasugrel 10-mg MD versus a clopidogrel 150-mg MD in patients with ACS who had received a clopidogrel 900-mg LD. Patients with non-ST elevation ACS, treated with aspirin and a clopidogrel 900-mg LD, were randomised within 24 hours post-LD to receive a prasugrel 10-mg or clopidogrel 150-mg MD. After 14 days of the initial MD, subjects switched to the alternative treatment for 14 days. The primary endpoint compared maximum platelet aggregation (MPA, 20 microM adenosine diphosphate [<e>ADP</e>]) between prasugrel and clopidogrel MDs for both periods. Responder analyses between treatments were performed using several platelet-function methods. Of 56 randomised subjects, 37 underwent PCI. MPA was 26.2% for prasugrel 10 mg and 39.1% for clopidogrel 150 mg (p&lt;0.001). The prasugrel MD regimen reduced MPA from the post-900-mg LD level (41.2% to 29.1%, p=0.003). Poor response ranged from 0% to 6% for prasugrel 10 mg and 4% to 34% for clopidogrel 150 mg. Thus, in ACS patients a prasugrel 10-mg MD regimen resulted in significantly greater platelet inhibition than clopidogrel at twice its approved MD or a 900-mg LD.",M1
20062919,"Clopidogrel response status assessed with Multiplate point-of-care analysis and the incidence and timing of stent thrombosis over six months following coronary stenting.Clopidogrel low-responsiveness assessed with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA) has been shown to be a strong and independent predictor of early stent thrombosis (ST) after coronary stenting. The relation of clopidogrel response status, as assessed with MEA, with incidence and timing of ST during an extended follow-up period has never been reported. Here, we report the six-month follow-up results of a prospective trial assessing clopidogrel responsiveness with MEA in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 1,608 consecutive patients with planned drug-eluting stent placement were enrolled in this study. Before PCI patients uniformly received 600 mg clopidogrel and blood was taken directly before PCI to measure <e>ADP</e>-induced platelet aggregation with MEA. The upper quintile (20%) of patients according to MEA measurements (n=323) was defined as clopidogrel low responders. Compared with normal responders (n=1,285), the cumulative incidence of definite ST within six months was significantly higher in low responders [2.5% vs. 0.4%; OR 6.5; 95% CI, 2.4-17.0; P&lt;0.001]. The combined incidence of definite or probable ST was higher as well in low vs. normal responders [4.1% vs. 0.7%; OR 5.8; 95% CI, 2.8-12.3; P&lt;0.0001]. A significant inverse correlation of MEA values and the timing of definite or probable ST (in days) was observed (Spearman coefficient = -0.45; P=0.04) with events occurring earlier in the low-responder group. MEA measurements are highly predictive for the occurrence of ST during the first six months following coronary stenting. In the majority of clopidogrel low responders suffering ST, the ischaemic event occurs early in the course after the procedure.",M1
20059377,"Comparison of bioluminescent kinase assays using substrate depletion and product formation.Assays for ATPases have been enabled for high-throughput screening (HTS) by employing firefly luciferase to detect the remaining ATP in the assay. However, for any enzyme assay, measurement of product formation is a more sensitive assay design. Recently, technologies that allow detection of the <e>ADP</e> product from ATPase reactions have been described using fluorescent methods of detection. We describe here the characterization of a bioluminescent assay that employs firefly luciferase in a coupled-enzyme assay format to enable detection of ADP levels from ATPase assays (ADP-Glo, Promega Corp.). We determined the performance of the ADP-Glo assay in 1,536-well microtiter plates using the protein kinase Clk4 and a 1,352 member kinase focused combinatorial library. The ADP-Glo assay was compared to the Clk4 assay performed using a bioluminescence ATP-depletion format (Kinase-Glo, Promega Corp). We performed this analysis using quantitative HTS (qHTS) where we determined potency values for all library members and identified approximately 300 compounds with potencies ranging from as low as 50 nM to &gt;10 microM, yielding a robust dataset for the comparison. Both assay formats showed high performance (Z'-factors approximately 0.9) and showed a similar potency distribution for the actives. We conclude that the bioluminescence ADP detection assay system is a viable generic alternative to the widely used ATP-depletion assay for ATPases and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.",M1
20059376,"Evaluation of an antibody-free <e>ADP</e> detection assay: ADP-Glo.Identification of kinase, especially protein kinase, modulators through high-throughput screening (HTS) has become a common strategy for drug discovery programs in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. There are a number of platform technologies that can be used for measuring kinase activities. However, there is none that fits all criteria in terms of sensitivity, ATP tolerance, robustness, throughput, and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, development of a homogeneous and robust HTS assay for some kinase targets is still challenging. We recently evaluated the ADP-Glo assay from Promega. This is a homogeneous, signal increase assay that measures ADP production from a kinase reaction by coupled enzymes that first convert ADP to ATP and subsequently quantifies ATP using luciferase in the presence of luciferin. Since the unused ATP in the reaction is depleted prior to ADP to ATP conversion, this assay shows excellent sensitivity over a wide range of ATP concentrations. We demonstrate that ADP-Glo assay can be used for 2 kinase targets that belong to different classes, and compare the results of compound profiling with SPA and FP assay technologies.",M1
20059362,"A Simple and robust automated kinase profiling platform using luminescent <e>ADP</e> accumulation technology.Kinases continue to be one of the most important targets in today's drug discovery efforts. Following the identification of lead compounds through screening efforts, it is important to profile these leads against other kinases within that family, as well as from other families, to ascertain potential off-target effects. Because many kinase assays require the use of different substrates, optimization time and costs during profiling can be prohibitive. Here we demonstrate the versatility of a luminescent ADP accumulation assay, where one set of reagents can be used for a wide variety of kinases with differing K(m app) for ATP and substrates. Assay sensitivity allows for the use of low enzyme concentrations and small percent ATP conversion levels while still maintaining high signal:background ratios. We have used a simple, inexpensive automated pipetting system to automate the entire process from enzyme optimization through generation of compound IC(50) values. Agreement with literature values proves this combination of chemistry and instrumentation provides a simple, yet robust solution for automated kinase profiling.",M1
20050186,"P2X2, P2X4 and P2Y1 receptors elevate intracellular Ca2+ in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived GABAergic neurons.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are a valuable resource for basic pharmacological research. With the exception of cardiomyocytes, there is relatively little understanding of the pharmacology of stem cell-derived differentiated cells. In this study we investigate P2 receptor agonist effects on GABAergic neurons derived from mESCs. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: mESCs were differentiated into GABAergic neurons in the presence of N2B27 culture medium. At day 24 of differentiation GABAergic neuronal responsiveness to purinergic agonists was investigated using calcium imaging and [3H]-GABA release studies. KEY RESULTS: Sub-populations of GABAergic neurons responded to some or all of the adenine and uracil nucleotides ATP, <e>ADP</e>, UTP and UDP (all 100 microM) with elevations of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). The number of neurons responding to ATP was reduced by suramin (100 microM), PPADS (10 microM) and MRS2179 (10 microM), but not by NF023 (10 microM). The response to ATP was modulated by extracellular Zn2+ and pH. Neurons also responded to ATP (100 microM) with the release of [3H]-GABA, an effect completely inhibited by tetrodotoxin (100 nM). Ap4A and 2-methylthioATP both elicited significant [3H]-GABA release. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed the presence of P2X1,2,3,4,5,6 and P2X7, and P2Y1,2 and P2Y6 receptors. mESCs expressed P2X2,5 and P2X7 and P2Y1,2 and P2Y6 receptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: GABAergic neurons derived from stem cells elevate [Ca2+]i predominantly via the activation of P2X2, P2X4 and P2Y1 receptors. This study shows that mESCs generate good models of neuronal function for in vitro pharmacological investigation.",M1
20044937,"Cloning and characterization of Escherichia coli DUF299: a bifunctional <e>ADP</e>-dependent kinase--Pi-dependent pyrophosphorylase from bacteria.BACKGROUND: Phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS; EC 2.7.9.2) catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate from pyruvate in Escherichia coli when cells are grown on a three carbon source. It also catalyses the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis. A bioinformatics search conducted following the successful cloning and expression of maize leaf pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP) revealed the presence of PDRP homologs in more than 300 bacterial species; the PDRP homolog was identified as DUF299. RESULTS: This paper describes the cloning and expression of both PEPS and DUF299 from E. coli and establishes that E. coli DUF299 catalyzes both the ADP-dependent inactivation and the Pi-dependent activation of PEPS. CONCLUSION: This paper represents the first report of a bifunctional regulatory enzyme catalysing an ADP-dependent phosphorylation and a Pi-dependent pyrophosphorylation reaction in bacteria.",M1
20042731,"Acetylsalicylic acid enhances purinergic receptor-mediated outward currents in rat megakaryocytes.Purinergic receptor activation increases cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in a fluctuating fashion, triggering oscillatory outward Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents in rat megakaryocytes (MKs). Whole cell and nystatin-perforated patch-clamp techniques were used to analyze changes in ionic conductance in MK with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor and antithrombotic agent. MKs are a model for platelet reactivity, particularly in ASA treatment failure (ASA resistance). Freshly isolated MKs were incubated 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 mM ASA. Using a K(+)-rich internal solution, we recorded outward currents in response to 10 microM ATP, 10 microM <e>ADP</e>, and 5 microM 2-methyl-thio-ADP (2MeSADP) in the voltage-clamp mode. Agonist-induced currents decreased in amplitude over time, but this decline was attenuated by ASA in both continuous and repeated agonist challenge, indicating increased MK reactivity with ASA treatment. In separate experiments, heterologous desensitization was observed when MKs were stimulated with ADP after exposure to a thromboxane receptor agonist (U46619), indicating cross talk between thromboxane and purinergic pathways. Different cells, treated with ASA or MRS2179 (P2Y1 receptor antagonist), were stimulated with 2MeSADP. The dose-response curve was shifted to the left in both cases, suggesting increased MK reactivity. ASA also caused an increased interval between currents (delay). ASA attenuated desensitization of purinergic receptors and increased delay, again suggesting cross talk between purinergic and thromboxane pathways. These findings may be relevant to ASA resistance, because individual variations in sensitivity to the multiple effects of ASA on signaling pathways could result in insensitivity to its antiplatelet effects in some patients.",M1
20038140,"Nucleotide- and substrate-induced conformational transitions in the CBS domain-containing pyrophosphatase of Moorella thermoacetica.In contrast to all other known pyrophosphatases, Moorella thermoacetica pyrophosphatase (mtCBS-PPase) contains nucleotide-binding CBS domains and is thus strongly regulated by adenine nucleotides. Stopped-flow measurements using a fluorescent AMP analogue, 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthranoyl)-AMP (Mant-AMP), reveal that nucleotide binding to mtCBS-PPase involves a three-step increase in Mant-AMP fluorescence with relaxation times from 0.01 to 100 s, implying conformational changes in the complex. This effect is reversed by AMP. Metal cofactors (Co(2+) and Mg(2+)) enhance the fluorescence signal but are not absolutely required, unlike what is seen when the catalytic reaction is examined. The relaxation times and amplitudes of the fluorescence signals depend on Mant-AMP concentration in a manner suggestive of the presence of a second binding site for Mant-AMP on the protein. Equilibrium fluorescence titration experiments additionally support the presence of two types of AMP binding sites with different affinities, whereas equilibrium dialysis and membrane filtration measurements reveal binding of one AMP molecule per enzyme monomer, implying negative cooperativity in nucleotide binding. The substrate (PP(i)) modulates Mant-AMP binding, leading to a further conformational change in the enzyme-Mant-AMP complex, and stimulates mtCBS-PPase in alkaline medium within a time scale of minutes, via conversion to a more active form. This active form initially comprises only a third of the enzyme, as estimated from kinetic titration with <e>ADP</e>. AMP inhibits both enzyme forms but is unable to independently induce interconversion. Our results collectively suggest that nucleotides and the substrate induce multiple conformational changes in mtCBS-PPase occurring over a wide time scale; the changes are distinct and almost independent.",M1
20035616,"Evaluating the utility of a bioluminescent <e>ADP</e>-detecting assay for lipid kinases.The lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are well recognized to play important roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and migration. Disruption of lipid signaling pathways often leads to human cancers, making lipid kinases attractive drug targets. In order to develop novel drugs against these enzymes, an assay that monitors their activity and amenable to high-throughput scale for screening large number of compounds is essential. The newly developed ADP-Glo assay is such an assay that measures kinase activity of lipid kinases by detecting the formation of ADP using a highly robust and sensitive bioluminescence approach. We evaluated this technology for studying lipid kinases, class I PI3 kinases, and sphingosine kinases and we show that the assay exhibits good tolerance to different lipids substrates. It generates kinetic parameters for substrates and inhibitors similar to those reported in the literature using other published assay formats. The sensitivity and robustness of this assay allow the detection of 5% of substrate conversion with Z' values &gt;0.7 making it attractive for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications. It is noteworthy that ADP-Glo assay addresses the need for a single integrated platform to comprehensively measure all classes of lipid and protein kinases. The selected inhibitors of lipid kinases can be screened against the panel of desired protein kinases, making ADP-Glo assay a simple, inexpensive platform for HTS and profiling of lipid kinases.",M1
20033434,"The effect of substrate, <e>ADP</e> and uncoupler on the respiration of tomato pollen during incubation in vitro at moderately high temperature.Pollen of tomato cv. Supermarmande was collected from greenhouse-grown plants at various intervals throughout the year and arbitrarily classified as of high, medium or low respiratory activity on the basis of CO(2) production during 8 h incubation in vitro at 30 degrees C, a temperature that is considered to be moderately high for tomato fruit set. After an initial burst of respiration during the first stage of hydration at 30 degrees C (&gt;1 h), the respiration rate of pollen of all three categories declined, the decrease being greater in the lots with a low or medium respiratory activity than in the high category. During hydration (10 min after the start of incubation), the addition of succinate or reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to the substrate increased the respiratory rate of slowly-respiring pollen more than that of fast-respiring pollen, but carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) had less effect. After 1-4 h incubation, the respiration rate of the slow- or medium-respiring pollen lots had decreased, but was stimulated by succinate or NADH, and to a lesser degree by ADP. By 7 h, the respiration rate of all pollen lots had declined and was stimulated less by substrate, ADP or CCCP. The oxidation of NADH by tomato pollen contrasts with the failure of other pollen species to utilize this substrate; moreover, a synergistic effect of NADH and succinate was consistently observed. We conclude that the decline in respiration during incubation for up to 4 h at 30 degrees C may reflect a lack of respiratory substrate. After 7 h, however, the decreased response to substrate indicates a loss of mitochondrial integrity or an accumulation of metabolic inhibitors. It is concluded that at 30 degrees C (a moderately high temperature for tomato pollen), the initially high rate of respiration leads to exhaustion of the endogenous respiratory substrates (particularly in pollen with low to medium respiratory activity), but subsequently to ageing and a loss of mitochondrial activity.",M1
20028084,"Kinetic mechanism of DNA unwinding by the BLM helicase core and molecular basis for its low processivity.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a strong predisposition to a wide range of cancers commonly affecting the general population. Understanding the functioning mechanism of the BLM protein may provide the opportunity to develop new effective therapy strategies. In this work, we studied the DNA unwinding kinetic mechanism of the helicase core of the BLM protein using various stopped-flow assays. We show that the helicase core of BLM unwinds duplex DNA as monomers even under conditions strongly favoring oligomerization. An unwinding rate of approximately 20 steps per second and a step size of 1 bp have been determined. We have observed that the helicase has a very low processivity. From dissociation and inhibition experiments, we have found that during its ATP hydrolysis cycle in DNA unwinding the helicase tends to dissociate from the DNA substrate in the <e>ADP</e> state. The experimental results imply that the BLM helicase core may unwind duplex DNA in an inchworm manner.",M1
20026305,"Active creatine kinase is present in matrix vesicles isolated from femurs of chicken embryo: Implications for bone mineralization.Proteomic analysis of matrix vesicles (MVs) isolated from 17-day-old chicken embryo femurs revealed the presence of creatine kinase. In this report we identified the enzyme functionally and suggest that the enzyme may participate in the synthesis of ATP from <e>ADP</e> and phosphocreatine within the lumen of these organelles. Then, ATP is converted by nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes such as Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, protein kinase C, or alkaline phosphatase to yield inorganic phosphate (P(i)), a substrate for mineralization. Alternatively, ATP can be hydrolyzed by a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 producing inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)), a mineralization inhibitor. In addition, immunochemical evidence indicated that VDAC 2 is present in MVs that may serve as a transporter of nucleotides from the extracellular matrix. We discussed the implications of ATP production and hydrolysis by MVs as regulatory mechanisms for mineralization.",M1
20026031,"Pyruvate kinase in pig liver mitochondria.The existence of the pyruvate kinase (PK) in pig liver mitochondria was shown by monitoring photometrically the PK reaction in solubilised mitochondria with either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or <e>ADP</e> used as a substrate. In distinction with the cytosolic isoenzyme, the mitochondrial PK showed a sigmoidal dependence on either PEP or ADP concentrations. The occurrence of the mitochondrial PK was confirmed by immunological analysis. Titration with digitonin showed that mPK is restricted to the matrix. PEP addition to mitochondria resulted in reduction of the intramitochondrial NAD(P)+ inhibited by either the non-penetrant thiol reagent mersalyl or by arsenite, an inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Citrate/oxaloacetate appearance outside mitochondria also occurred as result of PEP addition to PLM. Taken together these findings support a role for PEP itself in triggering fatty acid synthesis via its mitochondrial metabolism.",M1
20024494,"Loss of high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor multimers mainly affects platelet aggregation in patients with aortic stenosis.Severe aortic stenosis is associated with a haemostatic abnormality that resembles acquired von Willebrand syndrome type 2. It is assumed that high shear conditions render large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers accessible to cleavage by ADAMTS-13. However, whether loss of these large multimers affects platelet function by impairing adhesion, aggregate formation, or both has not been evaluated in clinical studies. We prospectively enrolled 47 patients with severe aortic stenosis, and studied them prior to aortic valve surgery and at a median of six months after valve replacement. We investigated levels of large VWF multimers, platelet function under high shear conditions, and residual response to suboptimal concentrations of <e>ADP</e> to express P-selectin. As expected, there was a significant reduction of VWF large multimers before surgery that resolved thereafter in most patients (p&lt;0.0001). The closure time of the ADP cartridge of the PFA-100 was also corrected in most patients after the operation (p&lt;0.0001). We used the cone and plate(let) analyser Impact-R to differentiate between adhesion and aggregation. Both adhesion (p=0.03) and ADP-inducible platelet aggregation (p=0.002) improved considerably after valve replacement. Consequently, ADP-inducible expression of P-selectin was higher after valve replacement (p=0.001). We conclude that reduced levels of large VWF multimers associated with aortic stenosis lead to impairment of both adhesion and, especially, ADP-inducible platelet aggregation.",M1
20018767,"The SAH domain extends the functional length of the myosin lever.Stable, single alpha-helix (SAH) domains are widely distributed in the proteome, including in myosins, but their functions are unknown. To test whether SAH domains can act as levers, we replaced four of the six calmodulin-binding IQ motifs in the levers of mouse myosin 5a (Myo5) with the putative SAH domain of Dictyostelium myosin MyoM of similar length. The SAH domain was inserted between the IQ motifs and the coiled coil in a Myo5 HMM construct in which the levers were truncated from six to two IQ motifs (Myo5-2IQ). Electron microscopy of this chimera (Myo5-2IQ-SAH) showed the SAH domain was straight and 17 nm long as predicted, restoring the truncated lever to the length of wild-type (Myo5-6IQ). The powerstroke (of 21.5 nm) measured in the optical trap was slightly less than that for Myo5-6IQ but much greater than for Myo5-2IQ. Myo5-2IQ-SAH moved processively along actin at physiological ATP concentrations with similar stride and run lengths to Myo5-6IQ in in-vitro single molecule assays. In comparison, Myo5-2IQ is not processive under these conditions. Solution biochemical experiments indicated that the rear head did not mechanically gate the rate of <e>ADP</e> release from the lead head, unlike Myo5-6IQ. These data show that the SAH domain can form part of a functional lever in myosins, although its mechanical stiffness might be lower. More generally, we conclude that SAH domains can act as stiff structural extensions in aqueous solution and this structural role may be important in other proteins.",M1
20018251,"The co-chaperone BAG3 interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT: new hints for actin folding.It has been recently hypothesized that BAG3 protein, a co-chaperone of Hsp70/Hsc70, is involved in the regulation of several cell processes, such as apoptosis, autophagy and cell motility. Following the identification of Hsc70/Hsp70, further BAG3 molecular partners such as PLC-gamma and HspB8 were likewise identified, thus contributing to the characterization of the mechanisms and the biological roles carried out by this versatile protein. By using a His-tagged BAG3 protein as bait, we fished out and identified the cytosolic chaperonin CCT, a new unreported BAG3 partner. The interaction between BAG3 and CCT was confirmed and characterized by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and surface plasmon resonance techniques. Furthermore, our analyses showed a slower CCT association and a faster dissociation with a truncated form of BAG3 containing the BAG domain, thus indicating that other protein regions are essential for a high-affinity interaction. ATP or <e>ADP</e> does not seem to significantly influence the chaperonin binding to BAG3 protein. On the other hand, our experiments showed that BAG3 silencing by small interfering RNA slowed down cell migration and influence the availability of correctly folded monomeric actin, analyzed by DNAse I binding assays and latrunculin A depolymerization studies. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a biologically relevant interaction between the chaperonin CCT and BAG3 protein, thus suggesting interesting involvement in the folding processes regulated by CCT.",M1
20017912,"Intracellular diffusion restrictions in isolated cardiomyocytes from rainbow trout.BACKGROUND: Restriction of intracellular diffusion of adenine nucleotides has been studied intensively on adult rat cardiomyocytes. However, their cause and role in vivo is still uncertain. Intracellular membrane structures have been suggested to play a role. We therefore chose to study cardiomyocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which are thinner and have fewer intracellular membrane structures than adult rat cardiomyocytes. Previous studies suggest that trout permeabilized cardiac fibers also have diffusion restrictions. However, results from fibers may be affected by incomplete separation of the cells. This is avoided when studying permeabilized, isolated cardiomyocytes. The aim of this study was to verify the existence of diffusion restrictions in trout cardiomyocytes by comparing <e>ADP</e>-kinetics of mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized fibers, permeabilized cardiomyocytes and isolated mitochondria from rainbow trout heart. Experiments were performed at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C in the absence and presence of creatine. RESULTS: Trout cardiomyocytes hypercontracted in the solutions used for mammalian cardiomyocytes. We developed a new solution in which they retained their shape and showed stable steady state respiration rates throughout an experiment. The apparent ADP-affinity of permeabilized cardiomyocytes was different from that of fibers. It was higher, independent of temperature and not increased by creatine. However, it was still about ten times lower than in isolated mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between fibers and cardiomyocytes suggest that results from trout heart fibers were affected by incomplete separation of the cells. However, the lower ADP-affinity of cardiomyocytes compared to isolated mitochondria indicate that intracellular diffusion restrictions are still present in trout cardiomyocytes despite their lower density of intracellular membrane structures. The lack of a creatine effect indicates that trout heart lacks mitochondrial creatine kinase tightly coupled to respiration. This argues against diffusion restriction by the outer mitochondrial membrane. These results from rainbow trout cardiomyocytes resemble those from other low-performance hearts such as neonatal rat and rabbit hearts. Thus, it seems that metabolic regulation is related to cardiac performance, and it is likely that rainbow trout can be used as a model animal for further studies of the localization and role of diffusion restrictions in low-performance hearts.",M1
20007455,"Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src within the cavity of the adenine nucleotide translocase 1 regulates <e>ADP</e>/ATP exchange in mitochondria.Phosphorylation of adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) at residue Y194, which is part of the aromatic ladder located within the lumen of the carrier, critically regulates mitochondrial metabolism. Recent data support the concept that members of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are constitutively present in mitochondria and key to regulation of mitochondrial function. Herein, we demonstrate that site mutations of ANT1 (Y190--&gt;F190, Y194--&gt;F194) mimicking dephosphorylation of the aromatic ladder resulted in loss of oxidative growth and ADP/ATP exchange activity in respiration-incompetent yeast expressing mutant chimeric yN-hANT1. ANT1 is phosphorylated at Y194 by the Src family kinase members Src and Lck, and increased phosphorylation is tightly linked to reduced cell injury in preconditioned protected vs. unprotected cardiac mitochondria. Molecular dynamics simulations find the overall structure of the phosphorylated ANT1 stable, but with an increased steric flexibility in the region of the aromatic ladder, matrix loop m2, and four helix-linking regions. Combined with an analysis of the putative cytosolic salt bridge network, we reason that the effect of phosphorylation on transport is likely due to an accelerated transition between the main two conformational states (c&lt;--&gt;m) of the carrier during the transport cycle. Since  aromatic signatures  are typical for other mitochondrial carrier proteins with important biological functions, our results may be more general and applicable to these carriers.",M1
20000883,"Update on antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes: what do new drugs bring into clinical practice?The incidence of new coronary events in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g. cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid; ASA]) and <e>ADP</e> receptor blockers (e.g. clopidogrel) is high. Therefore, it is critical to identify patients who require more intense treatment such as those with poor tolerance to existing drugs, those with genotypes that predict treatment resistance, diabetic patients, and smokers. The new ADP receptor blockers (prasugrel, cangrelor, Ticagrelor) can provide greater efficacy but it should not be associated with increased bleeding.

20000380,"The stability of chicken nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 8 requires both of its transmembrane domains.Chicken nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 8 (NTPDase8) is a cell surface ectonucleotidase with a large extracellular domain (ECD) containing the active site and is anchored to the membrane by two transmembrane domains (TMDs) at the N- and C-termini. Unlike other cell surface NTPDases that have been characterized, the chicken NTPDase8 is not susceptible to substrate inactivation or agents that cause membrane perturbation. To determine if the stability of the enzyme is inherent in its ECD, the cDNA construct of the soluble chicken NTPDase8 was expressed and the protein purified. The ATPase activity of the purified soluble chicken NTPDase8 was less than 15% of that of the purified full-length enzyme. Strikingly, in contrast to the membrane-bound enzyme, the activity of the soluble chicken NTPDase8 decreased with time in a temperature-dependent manner as a result of inactivation by ATP, <e>ADP</e>, and P(i). Truncated mutants in which the ECD is anchored by a single TMD at either the N- or the C-terminus by the native chicken NTPDase TMDs or a TMD from a different NTPDase, human NTPDase2, also displayed a nonlinear time course of ATP hydrolysis. While removal of the N- or C-terminal TMD affected protein expression differently, the truncated mutants were generally similar to the soluble chicken NTPDase8 with respect to ATP, ADP, and P(i) inactivation. Other biochemical characteristics, e.g., ATPase/ADPase ratios, inhibition by azide, and affinity for ATP, were also altered when one or both of the TMDs were removed from the chicken NTPDase8. These results indicate that (1) both TMDs of the chicken NTPDase8 are required to maintain stability of the enzyme and maximal catalytic activity and (2) the conformations of the ectodomain in the soluble enzyme and the truncated mutants differ from that of the full-length chicken NTPDase8.",M1
19968974,"A neuroprotective exercise protocol reduces the adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in hippocampal synaptosomes and serum of rats.Regular and moderate exercise has been considered as an interesting neuroprotective strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which physical exercise alters brain function are unclear. Purinergic signaling seems to modulate the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal damage, since it has been described a neuroprotective activity of adenosine and a dual role of ATP. In the present study, we investigated the effect of daily moderate intensity exercise on ectonucleotidase activities in synaptosomes from hippocampus and the soluble nucleotidases from blood serum of rats. Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to non-exercised (sedentary) group and exercised during 20-min sessions on different programs. The effects of physical activity on hydrolysis of ATP, <e>ADP</e> and AMP were assayed in the synaptosomal fraction obtained from the hippocampus and serum approximately 16 h after the last training session. Our data demonstrated that a neuroprotective exercise protocol, daily 20 min of training in treadmill during 2 weeks, diminished significantly the ADP hydrolysis and there is a trend to reduce the ATP hydrolysis in both hippocampal synaptosomes and blood serum of rats. We suggest that the neuroprotective exercise protocol may modulate nucleotidase activities.",M1
19966224,"Structural dynamics of the myosin relay helix by time-resolved EPR and FRET.We have used two complementary time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, dipolar electron-electron resonance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine conformational changes in a single structural element of the myosin motor domain, the relay helix, before and after the recovery stroke. Two double-Cys mutants were labeled with optical probes or spin labels, and interprobe distances were determined. Both methods resolved two distinct structural states of myosin, corresponding to straight and bent conformations of the relay helix. The bent state was occupied only upon nucleotide addition, indicating that relay helix, like the entire myosin head, bends in the recovery stroke. However, saturation of myosin with nucleotide, producing a single biochemical state, did not produce a single structural state. Both straight and bent structural states of the relay helix were occupied when either ATP (<e>ADP</e>.BeF(x)) or ADP.P(i) (ADP.AlF(4)) analogs were bound at the active site. A greater population was found in the bent structural state when the posthydrolysis analog ADP.AlF(4) was bound. We conclude that the bending of the relay helix in the recovery stroke does not require ATP hydrolysis but is favored by it. A narrower interprobe distance distribution shows ordering of the relay helix, despite its bending, during the recovery stroke, providing further insight into the dynamics of this energy-transducing structural transition.",M1

A putative ATP/ADP translocase was uncovered during the genomic sequencing of the intracellular plant pathogen  Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus,  the causal agent of citrus huanglongbing. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein revealed 12 transmembrane helices and predicted an isoelectric point of 9.4, both of which are characteristic of this family of proteins. The  Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus  gene (nttA) encoding the translocase was subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to enable E. coli to import ATP directly into the cell. Competition assays with the heterologous E. coli system demonstrated that the translocase was highly specific for ATP and ADP but that other nucleotides, if present in high concentrations, could also be taken up and/or block the ability of the translocase to import ATP. In addition, a protein homologous to NttA was identified in  Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum,  the bacterium associated with potato zebra chip disease. This is the first reported characterization of an ATP translocase from  Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus,  indicating that some intracellular bacteria of plants also have the potential to import ATP directly from their environment.",M1
19947384,"[The mechanism of phenoptosis: I. Age-dependent decrease of the overall rate of protein synthesis is caused by the programmed attenuation of bio-energetics]The age-dependent degradation of all vital processes of an organism can be result of influences of destructive factors (the stochastic mechanism of aging), or effect of realizations of the genetic program (phenoptosis). The stochastic free-radical theory of aging dominating now contradicts the set of empirical data, and the semicentenial attempts to create the means to slow down aging did not give any practical results. It makes obvious that the stochastic mechanism of aging is incorrect. At the same time, the alternative mechanism of the programmed aging is not developed yet but preconditions for it development have already been created. It is shown that the genes controlling process of aging exist (contrary to the customary opinion) and the increase in the level of damaged macromolecules (basic postulate of the free-radical theory) can be explained by programmed attenuation of bio-energetics. As the bio-energetics is a driving force of all vital processes, decrease of its level is capable to cause degradation of all functions of an organism. However to transform this postulate into a basis of the theory of phenoptosis it is necessary to show, that attenuation of bio-energetics predetermines such fundamental processes accompanying aging as decrease of the overall rate of protein biosynthesis, restriction of cellular proliferations (Hayflick limit), loss of telomeres etc. This article is the first step in this direction: the natural mechanism of interaction of overall rate of protein synthesis with a level of cellular bio-energetics is shown. This is built-in into the translation machine and based on dependence of recirculation rate of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (elF2) from ATP/<e>ADP</e> value that is created by mitochondrial bio-energetic machine.",M1
19944703,"Structural tightening and interdomain communication in the catalytic cycle of phosphoglycerate kinase.Changes in amide-NH chemical shift and hydrogen exchange rates as phosphoglycerate kinase progresses through its catalytic cycle have been measured to assess whether they correlate with changes in hydrogen bonding within the protein. Four representative states were compared: the free enzyme, a product complex containing 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG), a substrate complex containing <e>ADP</e> and a transition-state analogue (TSA) complex containing a 3PG-AlF(4)(-)-ADP moiety. There are an overall increases in amide protection from hydrogen exchange when the protein binds the substrate and product ligands and an additional increase when the TSA complex is formed. This is consistent with stabilisation of the protein structure by ligand binding. However, there is no correlation between the chemical shift changes and the protection factor changes, indicating that the protection factor changes are not associated with an overall shortening of hydrogen bonds in the protected ground state, but rather can be ascribed to the properties of the high-energy, exchange-competent state. Therefore, an overall structural tightening mechanism is not supported by the data. Instead, we observed that some cooperativity is exhibited in the N-domain, such that within this domain the changes induced upon forming the TSA complex are an intensification of those induced by binding 3PG. Furthermore, chemical shift changes induced by 3PG binding extend through the interdomain region to the C-domain beta-sheet, highlighting a network of hydrogen bonds between the domains that suggests interdomain communication. Interdomain communication is also indicated by amide protection in one domain being significantly altered by binding of substrate to the other, even where no associated change in the structure of the substrate-free domain is indicated by chemical shifts. Hence, the communication between domains is also manifested in the accessibility of higher-energy, exchange-competent states. Overall, the data that are consistent with structural tightening relate to defined regions and are close to the 3PG binding site and in the hinge regions of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase.",M1
19943882,"Antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel and bleeding in patients undergoing coronary stent placement.BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a link between bleeding and excess mortality has been demonstrated. A potential association of platelet response to clopidogrel and bleeding has not been well established yet. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of clopidogrel responsiveness on the risk of bleeding in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing PCI. METHODS: Patients (n=2533) undergoing PCI after pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel were enrolled in this study. Blood was obtained directly before PCI. Adenosine-diphosphate (<e>ADP</e>)-induced platelet aggregation was assessed on a Multiplate analyzer. The primary endpoint was the incidence of in-hospital Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding and the secondary endpoint was in-hospital TIMI minor bleeding. Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to derive the optimal platelet aggregation value defining enhanced clopidogrel responders for the association of measurements with major bleeding. RESULTS: Thirty-four (1.3%) major bleeding events and 137 (5.4%) minor bleeding events were observed. The risk of a major bleeding was significantly higher in patients (n=975) with an enhanced response to clopidogrel as compared with the remaining patients (n=1558) (2.2 vs. 0.8%, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-5.2, P=0.005; adjusted OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.3, P=0.001). No significant differences between both groups were observed for the occurrence of minor bleeding events (P=0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced clopidogrel responsiveness is associated with a higher risk of major bleeding. Whether guidance of antiplatelet treatment based on platelet function testing proves useful for avoiding bleeding events warrants further investigation.",M1
19940166,"Tripartite purinergic modulation of central respiratory networks during perinatal development: the influence of ATP, ectonucleotidases, and ATP metabolites.ATP released during hypoxia from the ventrolateral medulla activates purinergic receptors (P2Rs) to attenuate the secondary hypoxic depression of breathing by a mechanism that likely involves a P2Y(1)R-mediated excitation of preBötzinger complex (preBötC) inspiratory rhythm-generating networks. In this study, we used rhythmically active in vitro preparations from embryonic and postnatal rats and ATP microinjection into the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG)/preBötC to reveal that these networks are sensitive to ATP when rhythm emerges at embryonic day 17 (E17). The peak frequency elicited by ATP at E19 and postnatally was the same ( approximately 45 bursts/min), but relative sensitivity was threefold greater at E19, reflecting a lower baseline frequency (5.6 +/- 0.9 vs 19.0 +/- 1.3 bursts/min). Combining microinjection techniques with ATP biosensors revealed that ATP concentration in the rVRG/preBötC falls rapidly as a result of active processes and closely correlates with inspiratory frequency. A phosphate assay established that preBötC-containing tissue punches degrade ATP at rates that increase perinatally. Thus, the agonist profile [ATP/<e>ADP</e>/adenosine (ADO)] produced after ATP release in the rVRG/preBötC will change perinatally. Electrophysiology further established that the ATP metabolite ADP is excitatory and that, in fetal but not postnatal animals, ADO at A(1) receptors exerts a tonic depressive action on rhythm, whereas A(1) antagonists extend the excitatory action of ATP on inspiratory rhythm. These data demonstrate that ATP is a potent excitatory modulator of the rVRG/preBötC inspiratory network from the time it becomes active and that ATP actions are determined by a dynamic interaction between the actions of ATP at P2 receptors, ectonucleotidases that degrade ATP, and ATP metabolites on P2Y and P1 receptors.",M1
19928949,"Electron transfer dissociation facilitates sequencing of adenosine diphosphate-ribosylated peptides.Covalent adenosine diphosphate (<e>ADP</e>)-ribosylation of proteins is a post-translational modification that can occur both enzymatically and nonenzymatically and has been linked to many biological processes, such as the DNA damage and response mechanisms. Although the biochemistry of protein ADP-ribosylation has been extensively studied, the identification of physiological substrates remains a significant challenge due to inadequate tools for characterizing these modified peptides. Here we show that the use of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) greatly simplifies the mass spectrometric (MS) sequencing of ADP-ribosylated peptides over the conventional collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) approach. ETD sequencing of ADP-ribosylated peptides can be performed within a time scale compatible with nanoflow liquid chromatography and should prove useful for high-throughput large-scale studies on this unique class of modified peptides.",M1

19925786,"Pinacidil-primed ATP-sensitive potassium channels mediate feedback control of mechanical power output in isolated myocardium of rats and guinea pigs.We tested the hypothesis, that ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels limit cardiac energy demand by a feedback control of mean power output at increased cardiac rates. We analysed the interrelationships between rising energy demand of adult rat and guinea pig left ventricular papillary muscle and down-regulatory electromechanical effects mediated by K(ATP) channels. Using the K(ATP)-opener pinacidil the stimulation frequency was increased stepwise and the mechanical parameters and action potentials were recorded. Power output was derived from force-length area or force-time integral calculations, respectively. Simultaneously oxygen availability in the preparations was estimated by flavoprotein fluorescence measurements. <e>ADP</e>/ATP ratios were determined by HPLC. We found highly linear relationships between isotonic power output and the effects of pinacidil on isotonic shortening in both rat (r(2)=0.993) and guinea pig muscles (r(2)=0.997). These effects were solely observed for the descending limb of shortening-frequency relationships. In addition, a highly linear correlation between total force-time integral-derived power and pinacidil effects on action potential duration (APD(50), r(2)=0.92) was revealed. Power output became constant and frequency-independent in the presence of pinacidil at higher frequencies. In contrast, the K(ATP)-blocker glibenclamide produced a lengthening of APD(50) and increased force transiently at higher power levels. Pinacidil prevented core hypoxia and a change in ADP/ATP ratio during high frequency stimulation. We conclude, that pinacidil-primed cardiac K(ATP) channels homeostatically control power output during periods of high energy demand. This effect is associated with a reduced development of hypoxic areas inside the heart muscle by adapting cardiac function to a limited energy supply.",M1
19923980,"Impact of genetic polymorphisms on platelet function and aspirin resistance.Genetic polymorphisms may affect platelets' responses to the antiplatelet therapy. Our aim was to determine the role of genetic polymorphisms on aspirin resistance in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 126 consecutive patients (35-85 years old, 32% women) with chronic stable CHD was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) and collagen and adenosine diphosphate (Col/<e>ADP</e>) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time of less than 186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. Factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1), glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms were determined by three consecutive steps: isolation and amplification of DNA and reverse hybridization. We determined that 30 patients (23.8%) had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 74 +/- 12 s (51-104 s). Ten of the 30 patients with aspirin resistance were women (33.3%). Genetic polymorphisms were determined in 30 aspirin-resistant and 17 aspirin-sensitive patients. No statistically significant relationship was determined between aspirin resistance and the genetic panel. In our study we did not determine a significant relationship between the aspirin resistance and factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, PAI-1, glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms.",M1
19922813,"NTPDase family in zebrafish: Nucleotide hydrolysis, molecular identification and gene expression profiles in brain, liver and heart.The nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) family cleaves tri- and diphosphonucleosides to monophosphonucleosides and is responsible for terminating purinergic transmission. Since the NTPDase family in zebrafish is poorly understood, here we evaluated the nucleotide hydrolysis in three tissues of adult zebrafish (brain, liver, and heart), confirmed the presence of distinct NTPDase members by a phylogenetic analysis and verified their relative gene expression profiles in the respective tissues. A different profile of ATP and <e>ADP</e> hydrolysis in the brain, liver, and heart as a function of time and protein concentration was observed. Sodium azide (20mM), ARL 67156 (300 microM) and Suramin (300 microM) differently altered the nucleotide hydrolysis in zebrafish tissues, suggesting the contribution of distinct NTPDase activities. Homology-based searches identified the presence of NTPDase1-6 and NTPDase8 orthologs and the phylogeny also grouped three NTPDase2 and two NTPDase5 paralogs. The deduced amino acid sequences share the apyrase conserved regions, conserved cysteine residues, putative N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, N-acetylation sites, and different numbers of transmembrane domains. RT-PCR experiments revealed the existence of a distinct relative entpd1-6 and entpd8 expression profile in brain, liver, and heart. Taken together, these results indicate that several NTPDase members might contribute to a tight regulation of nucleotide hydrolysis in zebrafish tissues.",M1
19919670,"PolY, a transcriptional regulator with ATPase activity, directly activates transcription of polR in polyoxin biosynthesis in Streptomyces cacaoi.polY, a transcriptional regulatory gene in the polyoxin biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces cacaoi, was analysed, and its deduced product (PolY) showed amino acid sequence homology to AfsR from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). PolY contains an OmpR-like DNA binding domain at its N-terminal and an ATPase domain in the middle of the protein. Disruption of polY abolished polyoxin biosynthesis, which could be restored by the integration of a single copy of polY into the chromosome of the disruption mutant. Transcription of polR, a pathway-specific regulatory gene of polyoxin biosynthesis, was controlled by polY. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I protection experiments indicated that PolY bound to the promoter region of polR, and the binding site contained a direct nucleotide repeat typical of Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein binding sites. PolY exhibited ATPase activity in vitro. Additionally, binding of <e>ADP</e>/ATPgammaS to ATPase domain triggered the oligomerization of PolY and enhanced its DNA binding activity. Consistently, further experiments in vivo demonstrated that changes of ADP/ATP concentrations significantly affected PolY activity in the cell. These results suggested that the ATPase domain might be a sensor of endogenous pool of ADP/ATP, whose change modulated PolY activity under the physiological conditions.",M1

Islet quality decreases during cultivation after the isolation procedure. To overcome this obstacle, we established the practice of islet and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) coculture. This coculture condition improved the ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate)/ADP (adenosine-5'-diphosphate) ratio and insulin secretory function in vitro. It is believed that the enhancement of islet quality in islet-MSCs cocultures may be caused by the secretion of active agents by MSCs. Herein we have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were significantly increased as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in MSCs-cultured medium, factors that have been shown to improve the survival, function, and angiogenesis/revascularization of islets. These results indicated that the quality of human islets was enhanced by trophic molecules secreted by MSCs, which influence the intracellular islet ATP content and insulin secretory function.",M1

Current situation and prospects]The school health service of the city of Basle is storing the routinly collected data not only in the personal records of each child but also on a data banc for several years now. The data concern developmental and health status of each child and the anamnestic informations given by his parents. The children are examined at the age of 5, 10 and 14 years. On the average nearly 6,000 children are screened each year. Annual evaluations of the data provide an overview of the present health situation of the youth and trends in morbidity, immunisation etc. E.g. gives a comparison of 10 years old Italian and Swiss children evidence that their average weight is significantly different while their size is nearly equal. Four years ago the <e>ADP</e>-system was reorganized in order to link each child's data of the three screening examinations at the three ages. Thus not only cross sectional but also longitudinal studies can be performed in future. It will enable to monitor growth and development of the children and to evaluate the outcome of the referals to therapeutic and preventive measures. At present the data of more than 22,000 children are stored, i.e. of 5,500 children of the Kindergarten, of 7,500 of the 4.th class (primary school) and 9,000 of the 8.th class (intermediate school).
