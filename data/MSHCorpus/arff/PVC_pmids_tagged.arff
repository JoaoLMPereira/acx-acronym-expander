20146783,"Rest premature ventricular contractions on routine ECG and prognosis in heart failure patients.BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) at rest are frequently seen in heart failure (HF) patients but conflicting data exist regarding their importance for cardiovascular (CV) mortality. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of rest PVCs on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with a history of clinical HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We considered 352 patients (64 + or - 11 years; 7 females) with a history of clinical HF undergoing treadmill testing for clinical reasons at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) (1987-2007). Patients with rest PVCs were defined as having &gt; or = 1 PVC on the ECG prior to testing (n = 29; 8%). During a median follow-up period of 6.2 years, there were 178 deaths of which 76 (42.6%) were due to CV causes. At baseline, compared to patients without rest PVCs, those with rest PVCs had a lower ejection fraction (EF) (30% vs 45%) and the prevalence of EF &lt; or = 35% was higher (75% vs 41%). They were more likely to have smoked (76% vs 55%).The all-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in the rest PVCs group (72% vs 49%, P = 0.01 and 45% vs 20%, P = 0.002; respectively). After adjusting for age, beta-blocker use, rest ECG findings, resting heart rate (HR), EF, maximal systolic blood pressure, peak HR, and exercise capacity, rest PVC was associated with a 5.5-fold increased risk of CV mortality (P = 0.004). Considering the presence of PVCs during exercise and/or recovery did not affect our results. CONCLUSION: The presence of PVC on an ECG is a powerful predictor of CV mortality even after adjusting for confounding factors.",M1
20020350,"The use of bayesian networks for heart beat classification.This work proposes to use a static Bayesian network as a tool to support medical decision in the on-line detection of Premature Ventricular Contraction beats (<e>PVC</e>) in electrocardiogram (ECG) records, which is a well known cardiac arrhythmia available for study in standard ECG databases. The main motivation to use Bayesian networks is their capability to deal with the uncertainty embedded in the problem (the medical reasoning itself frequently embeds some uncertainty). Indeed, the probabilistic inference is quite suitable to model this kind of problem, for considering its random character; as a consequence, random variables are used to propagate the uncertainty embedded in the problem. Some topologies of static Bayesian networks are implemented and tested in this work, in order to find out the one more suitable to the problem addressed. The results of such tests are discussed in details along the text, and the conclusions are highlighted.",M1
20003019,"Safety and feasibility of real time adenosine myocardial contrast echocardiography with emphasis on induction of arrhythmias: a study in healthy volunteers and patients with stable coronary artery disease.INTRODUCTION: Some studies reported an increased incidence of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) during triggered myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) using high-intensity ultrasound destruction. Whether PVCs are also induced by real time MCE using low emission power, is unknown. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias during real time adenosine MCE in healthy volunteers and patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers and 26 patients with stable CAD underwent real time MCE using Sonovue and power pulse inversion (ATL 5000) at rest and during adenosine stress. The occurrence of premature atrial complexes (PAC) and PVCs was analyzed before and during MCE using ECG-tracings from videotapes. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, the occurrence of PVCs at baseline (0.04 +/- 0.23 PVCs/min) was similar at rest (0.04 +/- 0.23 PVCs/min, P = NS), and adenosine stress (0.03 +/- 0.14, P = NS). In CAD patients, the occurrence of PVCs at baseline was 0.30 +/- 0.76 PVC/min, compared to 0.29 +/- 0.74 at rest (P = NS), and 0.34 +/- 0.74 during adenosine stress (P = NS). The number of subjects demonstrating PVCs did not increase during MCE. The occurrence of PACs during MCE was not increased compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: Real time MCE using low emission power does not increase the occurrence of premature complexes in healthy volunteers or CAD patients.",M1
19879531,"Impact of radiofrequency ablation of frequent post-infarction premature ventricular complexes on left ventricular ejection fraction.BACKGROUND: Frequent idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVC</e>) are associated with a reversible form of cardiomyopathy. The effect of frequent PVCs on left ventricular function has not been evaluated in post-infarction patients. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the value of post-infarction PVC ablation and possible determinants of a reversible cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients (24 men, age 61 +/- 12, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 0.36 +/- 0.12) with remote myocardial infarction referred for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for primary prevention of sudden death or for management of symptomatic ventricular tachycardia or PVCs were evaluated. Fifteen patients with a high PVC burden (&gt;or=5% of all QRS complexes on 24-h Holter monitor) underwent mapping and ablation of PVCs before ICD implantation. The remaining 15 patients served as a control group. LVEF was assessed by echocardiography, and scar burden was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with delayed enhancement (DE-MRI) in both groups. RESULTS: PVC ablation was successful in 15 of 15 patients and reduced the mean PVC burden from 22 +/- 12% to 2.6 +/- 5.0% (P &lt;.001). After the procedure, LVEF increased significantly from 0.38 +/- 0.11 to 0.51 +/- 0.09 in the PVC ablation group (P = .0001). In the control group, LVEF remained unchanged within the same time frame (0.34 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.15; P = .6). Patients with frequent PVCs had a significantly smaller scar burden by DE-MRI compared with control patients. Five of the patients with frequent PVCs underwent ICD implantation. CONCLUSION: Post-infarction patients with frequent PVCs may have a reversible form of cardiomyopathy. DE-MRI may identify patients in whom the LVEF may improve after ablation of frequent PVCs.",M1
19816869,"Depressive symptoms and risk factors in Chinese patients with premature ventricular contractions without structural heart disease.HYPOTHESIS: Our objective was to study depressive symptoms and potential risk factors in Chinese persons with premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) without structural heart disease. METHODS: The Zung self-rating depression scale (ZSDS) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Correlations between depressive symptoms and sociodemographic and medical factors were analyzed by logistic regression. BACKGROUND: Prevalence of depressive symptoms in coronary heart disease (CHD) is higher that in the general population and those for the majority of other chronic symptoms in patients with premature ventricular contractions (PUCS). RESULTS: Of 1,144 patients with PVCs (488 males, 656 females), age 51 +/- 23 years, disease duration 1 mo - 23 y, a total of 309 (27%) patients were categorized as having depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms increased with age, income, education level, nationality, PVC count/24h, society support, and settlement type (p &lt; 0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that being female, level of education, age, settlement type, and PVC count/24h significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that 5 variables-female sex, education level, settlement type, age, and PVC count/24h significantly and independently related with depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the Chinese population, depressive symptoms in subjects with PVCs were frequent. The village settlement type, female sex, age, PVC count/24h, and education level were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Further research on the relationship between PVCs and depressive symptoms in China is necessary.",M1
19796340,"Premature ventricular contractions arising from the intramural ventricular septum.A 68-year-old man with symptomatic idiopathic premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) underwent electrophysiological testing. Radiofrequency catheter ablation was unsuccessful at the earliest endocardial ventricular activation site in the left coronary cusp. Epicardial mapping via the cardiac veins was then performed. Balloon-occluded coronary sinus venography revealed the small branches of the anterior interventricular vein. Mapping with a microcatheter revealed the earliest ventricular activation and perfect pace map at the distal portion of the septal perforating branch, suggesting an intramural ventricular septal PVC origin. Catheter ablation was abandoned because of the inaccessibility of the ablation catheter to that site via the venous system.",M1
19758851,"Robust detection of premature ventricular contractions using a wave-based Bayesian framework.Detection and classification of ventricular complexes from the ECG is of considerable importance in Holter and critical care patient monitoring, being essential for the timely diagnosis of dangerous heart conditions. Accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) is particularly important in relation to life-threatening arrhythmias. In this paper, we introduce a model-based dynamic algorithm for tracking the ECG characteristic waveforms using an extended Kalman filter. The algorithm can work on single or multiple leads. A  polargram --a polar representation of the signal--is introduced, which is constructed using the Bayesian estimations of the state variables. The polargram allows the specification of a polar envelope for normal rhythms. Moreover, we propose a novel measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. PVCs are detected by simultaneous tracking the signal fidelity and the polar envelope. Five databases, including 40 records from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, are used for differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method has an average detection accuracy of 99.10%, aggregate sensitivity of 98.77%, and aggregate positive predictivity of 97.47%. Furthermore, the method is capable of 100% accuracy for records that contain only PVCs and normal sinus beats. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical PVC detection.",M1
19721133,"GAP-134 ([2S,4R]-1-[2-aminoacetyl]4-benzamidopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) prevents spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and reduces infarct size during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in open-chest dogs.The antiarrhythmic dipeptide, GAP-134, ([2S,4R]-1[2-aminoacetyl]-4-benzamido-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) was evaluated in canine ischemia/reperfusion model. In dogs subjected to 60-minute ischemia and 4-hour reperfusion, GAP-134 was administered 10 minutes before reperfusion as a bolus + intravenous (IV) infusion. The doses administered were 0.25 microg/kg bolus + 0.19 microg/kg per hour infusion; 2.5 microg/kg + 1.9 microg/kg per hour; 25 mg/kg + 19 mg/kg per hour; 75 mg/kg + 57 mg/kg per hour. Ventricular ectopy was quantified during reperfusion, including premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Total incidence of VT was reduced significantly with the 2 highest doses of GAP-134 (1.7 + 0.8; 2.2 + 1.4 events; P &lt; .05) compared to controls (23.0 + 6.1). Total PVCs were reduced significantly from 11.1 + 1.6% in control animals to 2.0% + 0.7% and 1.8% + 0.8% after the 2 highest doses of GAP-134. Infarct size, expressed as percentage of left ventricle, was reduced significantly from 19.0% + 3.5% in controls to 7.9% + 1.5% and 7.1% + 0.8% (P &lt; .05) at the 2 highest doses of GAP-134. GAP-134 is an effective antiarrhythmic agent with potential to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury.",M1
19553746,"Misleading ECG appearance of AV block due to concealed AV nodal conduction caused by interpolated ventricular ectopic beats.Concealed conduction commonly occurs when a retrogradely conducted interpolated ectopic impulse enters the atrioventricular (AV) node; thus, the next sinus beat is not conducted to the ventricle or conducted with a prolonged PR interval because of increased refractoriness of AV conduction system. A 67-year-old man had complaints of exertional fatigue and palpitations at rest. His blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and heart rate was 78 beats/min. Auscultation revealed a mild systolic murmur at the apex and an irregular rhythm. His electrocardiogram was normal, except for the presence of frequent premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVC</e>) of right bundle branch block morphology. Echocardiographic examination showed only grade-1 mitral regurgitation. Further evaluation with 24-h Holter monitoring showed frequent interpolated PVCs in bigeminal rhythm. Progressive prolongation of the PR interval was observed after each PVC, which ended with Mobitz type I AV block. The patient was treated with metoprolol which resulted in immediate and marked improvement in the symptoms. Control Holter recording showed very rare PVCs, without PR prolongation or AV block.",M1
19429571,"Prognostic significance of frequent premature ventricular contractions originating from the ventricular outflow tract in patients with normal left ventricular function.BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been reported that frequent premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) may be associated with causing heart failure in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, the prognostic significance of frequent PVCs in asymptomatic patients with a normal LV function is unclear. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients presenting with frequent PVCs (&gt;1000 beats/day) originating from the right or left ventricular outflow tract without any detectable heart disease were enrolled in the study. Structural heart disease was ruled out by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and Holter-ECG monitoring was repeated two or three times to evaluate the PVC prevalence at the initial evaluation. All patients were followed up for at least 4 years, and further observation was continued if possible. RESULTS: During an observation period of 5.6 (1.7) years, no patients exhibited any serious cardiac events. Although there was no significant change in the mean LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and mean LV diastolic dimension (LVDd), there was a significant negative correlation between the PVC prevalence and DeltaLVEF (p&lt;0.001) and positive correlation between the PVC prevalence and DeltaLVDd (p&lt;0.001). When the development of LV dysfunction was defined as DeltaLVEF&gt;-6%, 13 patients exhibited LV dysfunction. For the prediction of the development of LV dysfunction, PVC prevalence and LVEF at the initial evaluation were independent predicting factors (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Although the prognosis in patients with frequent PVCs was considered relatively benign, attention should be paid to the progression of the LV dysfunction during a long-term observation, especially in patients with a high PVC prevalence.",M1
19324308,"Differential effects of cardiac sodium channel mutations on initiation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Brugada syndrome.BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) do not occur frequently but can induce ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with Brugada syndrome. The effect of SCN5A mutation on the onset of ventricular arrhythmias is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate PVC morphology and onset of VF in patients with Brugada syndrome. METHODS: Morphology of PVCs was evaluated by 12-lead ECG in 32 patients with Brugada syndrome. Patients had spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia (n = 17) or sodium channel blocker-induced ventricular arrhythmia (n = 19). Patients were classified into two groups according to the existence of SCN5A mutation (22 mutation negative, 10 mutation positive). RESULTS: Patients without mutation often had PVCs of left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology (82%), especially with inferior axis (77%). Patients with mutation had PVCs of both right bundle branch block (36%) and LBBB (64%) morphologies. Only two patients with mutation had PVCs of LBBB, inferior-axis morphology. CONCLUSION: Patients without SCN5A mutation often had PVCs of LBBB, inferior-axis morphology, suggesting a right ventricular outflow tract origin. Patients with SCN5A mutations had PVCs that originated from both the right and left ventricles.",M1
19318662,"Diagnosis and management of premature ventricular complexes-associated chronic cough.BACKGROUND: Chronic cough frequently remains unexplained. Although various cardiac arrhythmias have already been reported as a cause of chronic cough, this phenomenon has not been evaluated prospectively. Therefore, we studied the incidence and management of cough associated with premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) in a population of patients with this condition. METHODS: Patients without organic heart disease who had been referred for the management of symptomatic PVC were evaluated prospectively. PVC-associated cough was recognized if cough episodes occurred just after spontaneous or induced PVC or observed in an ECG or a multichannel recording system that included ECG. A differential diagnosis of cough was performed according to the guidelines on cough. Afterward, antiarrhythmic therapy was instituted to eliminate PVC and cough. RESULTS: Of the 120 patients who were referred for the management of PVC, 10 had a chronic cough. After extensive workup for the cause of chronic cough, the cough was thought to be solely due to PVC in one patient, partially due to PVC plus another cause in five patients, and not due to PVC but to nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and chronic sinusitis in four patients. Patients with PVC-associated cough reported more severe perception of symptoms associated with arrhythmia than patients without cough (mean [+/- SD] visual analog scale score, 8.2 +/- 0.5 vs 5.7 +/- 1.6, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). PVC-associated cough disappeared after antiarrhythmic treatment (radiofrequency ablation [n = 4], oral antiarrhythmic agent [n = 1]), or after spontaneous remission of PVC (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: PVC may be a cause of chronic cough. Interdisciplinary cooperation is warranted for the proper diagnosis and management of PVC-associated cough.",M1
19272942,"Heart rate turbulence denoising using support vector machines.Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a transient acceleration and subsequent deceleration of the heart rate after a premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>), and it has been shown to be a strong risk stratification criterion in patients with cardiac disease. In order to reduce the noise level of the HRT signal, conventional measurements of HRT use a patient-averaged template of post-PVC tachogram (PPT), hence providing with long-term HRT indexes. We hypothesize that the reduction of the noise level at each isolated PPT, using signal processing techniques, will allow us to estimate short-term HRT indexes. Accordingly, its application could be extended to patients with reduced number of available PPT. In this paper, several HRT denoising procedures are proposed and tested, with special attention to support vector machine (SVM) estimation, as this is a robust algorithm that allows us to deal with few available time samples in the PPT. Pacing-stimulated HRT during electrophysiological study are used as a low-noise gold standard. Measurements in a 24-h Holter patient database reveal a significant reduction in the bias and the variance of HRT measurements. We conclude that SVM denoising yields short-term HRT measurements and improves the signal-to-noise level of long-term HRT measurements.",M1
19215994,"<e>PVC</e> discrimination using the QRS power spectrum and self-organizing maps.This paper deals with the discrimination of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) arrhythmia using the fractal behavior of the power spectrum density of the QRS complexes. The linear interpolation of the QRS complex power spectrum density in Bode diagram in two different frequency intervals gives two straight lines with two different slopes. The scatter plot of one slope versus the other shows that there exists two distinct regions which represent the normal beats and the PVC beats. Therefore the PVC beats are classified using a self-organizing map fed by the two slopes of the QRS complex power spectrum. The MIT/BIH arrhythmia database is then used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method in the discrimination of the premature ventricular contraction (PVC) arrhythmia. The results have indicated that the method has achieved 82.71% of sensitivity and 88.06% of specificity over 46 records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.",M1
19195768,"On the mechanisms of ultrasound contrast agents-induced arrhythmias.Recent reports have shown that imaging hard-shelled ultrasound (US) contrast agents at high mechanical indices engenders premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>). We have shown that the oscillations of microbubbles next to a cell induce a mechanical pressure on its membrane resulting in the activation of stretch activated channels (SAC). The aim of this study is to demonstrate, in vivo and in vitro, the relationship between PVCs and SAC opening. Five anesthetized rats were used. PVCs were created in vivo with (1) US and a diluted solution of contrast microbubbles injected intravenously through the tail vein at a rate of 0.5 mL per min and (2) a manually induced mechanical stimulus, which consisted of stimulations by a flexible catheter introduced into the rat aorta and pushed until the left ventricle. PVCs were quantified through ECG measurements. In vitro experiments consisted of patch Clamp measurements on HL-1 heart cell line. The stimulation was carried out either manually with a glass rod or with US and microbubbles. For both in vivo and in vitro experiments, US consisted of 40-cycle waveforms at 1 MHz and peak negative pressures up to 300 kPa and exposure time varied from 1 to 2 min. We should emphasize that these parameters are different from those used in diagnostic conditions. In vivo, microbubbles and US at 300 kPa induced modification of rat's ECG while pressures below 300 kPa did not induce any PVC. US alone did not modify the rat's ECG. Similar PVCs were also created when stimulation with a catheter was applied. Regular heart beat rate was recovered immediately after the stimulation was stopped. In vitro, the mechanical stretch induced a cell membrane depolarization due to SAC opening. Similar effect was observed with US and microbubbles. The cell potential returned to its initial value when the stimulation was released. In conclusion, we presume that PVCs are generated through a cascade of events characterized by a mechanical action of oscillating microbubbles, opening of stretch activated ion channels, membrane depolarization and triggering of action potentials.",M1
19179246,"Finding features for real-time premature ventricular contraction detection using a fuzzy neural network system.Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) have been successfully applied to generate predictive rules for medical or diagnostic data. This brief presents an approach to detect premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) using the neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFMs). The NEWFM classifies normal and PVC beats by the trained bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership functions (BSWFMs) using wavelet transformed coefficients from the MIT-BIH PVC database. The eight generalized coefficients, locally related to the time signal, are extracted by the nonoverlap area distribution measurement method. The eight generalized coefficients are used for the three PVC data sets with reliable accuracy rates of 99.80%, 99.21%, and 98.78%, respectively, which means that the selected features are less dependent on the data sets. It is shown that the locations of the eight features are not only around the QRS complex that represents ventricular depolarization in the electrocardiogram (ECG) containing a Q wave, an R wave, and an S wave, but also the QR segment from the Q wave to the R wave has more discriminate information than the RS segment from the R wave to the S wave. The BSWFMs of the eight features trained by NEWFM are shown visually, which makes the features explicitly interpretable. Since each BSWFM combines multiple weighted fuzzy membership functions into one using the bounded sum, the eight small-sized BSWFMs can realize real-time PVC detection in a mobile environment.",M1
19163956,"Automated patient-specific classification of premature ventricular contractions.In this paper, we present an automated patient-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classifier designed for accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>). In the proposed feature extraction scheme, the principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) of the ECG signal to extract morphological ECG features, which are then combined with the temporal features to form a resultant efficient feature vector. For the classification scheme, we selected the feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimally designed by the multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization (MD-PSO) technique, which evolves the structure and weights of the network specifically for each patient. Training data for the ANN classifier include both global (total of 150 representative beats randomly sampled from each class in selected training files) and local (the first 5 min of a patient's ECG recording) training patterns. Simulation results using 40 files in the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database achieved high average accuracy of 97% for differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats.",M1

In this paper a new approach for automatic detection of PVCs is presented, based on morphological derivatives and information theory techniques. Using these approaches a set of patient invariant features is introduced. Sensibility and specificity results (respectively, 96.35% and 99.15%) show the potential of the algorithm when applied to the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database.",M1
19082196,"Electrocardiographic changes in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with systemic glucantime.INTRODUCTION: Antimonial compounds are regarded as the treatment of choice for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Systemic administration of these drugs has some side effects including cardio toxicity and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes. The objective of our study was to evaluate EKG changes in the patients with CL treated with systemic glucantime. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one patients were enrolled in this prospective study. All of the selected patients had confirmed CL and were candidates for treatment with systemic glucantime. The patients were treated with systemic glucantime and EKG was performed before, during (weekly) and 1 month after cessation of the treatment. All of the collected data were analysed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The most common change was prolonged QT interval that was seen in 19% of the patients. ST depression occurred in 6.1% of the patients. Minimal ST elevation occurred in 3% and inverted T was observed in 7.4% of the patients. Single premature atrial contraction (PAC) and single premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) occurred in 0.7% and 2.29% of patients, respectively. Bradycardia was observed in 10.6% and left bundle branch block in 0.7% of the patients. All of these changes reversed after stopping the treatment except 1 case with left bundle branch block that lasted for 1 month after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that treatment with glucantime can induce many ECG changes as QT prolongation have significant risk. We suggest that ECG monitoring should be performed in high-risk patients undergoing glucantime treatment with special attention to ECG changes mostly prolonged QT interval.",M1
19080325,"Radiofrequency catheter ablation of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and symptomatic premature ventricular contraction originating from valve annulus.BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has been established as an effective and curative therapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and severely symptomatic premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) from the outflow tract in structurally normal hearts. This study aimed to investigate electrophysiologic characteristics and effects of RFCA for patients with idiopathic VT and symptomatic PVC originating from the valve annulus. METHODS: Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and endocardiogram in a successful RFCA target were analyzed in 16 patients with idiopathic VT and symptomatic PVC originating from the valve annulus. Additionally, the ECG characteristics of VT or PVC were compared with those of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome originating from the same site of origin in 15 patients. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were successful, 2 recurrent and 1 failed. The recurrent cases underwent successful ablation the second time guided by the Ensite 3000 mapping system. In all patients with the WPW syndrome, the characteristics of QRS morphology were well matched with those of the VT and PVC that originated from corresponding sites of origin. CONCLUSIONS: RFCA is an effective curative therapy for VT and symptomatic PVC originating from the valve annulus. There are specific characteristics in ECG and the ablation site could be located by means of the WPW syndrome accessory pathway's algorithm.",M1

A 58-year-old woman without structural heart disease was admitted for evaluation of recurrent episodes of syncope. Surface ECG showed frequent repetitive premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) of RVOT origin. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia triggered by the same PVC was documented by Holter ECG during an episode of syncope. Radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed to eradicate this PVC.

18775041,"Statin use and ventricular arrhythmias during clinical treadmill testing.BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) during exercise are associated with adverse prognosis, particularly in patients with intermediate treadmill test findings. Statin use reduces the incidence of resting ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease; however, the relationship between statin use and exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias has not been investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the association between statin use and PVCs in 1,847 heart-failure-free patients (mean age 58, 95% male) undergoing clinical exercise treadmill testing between 1997 and 2004 in the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. PVCs were quantified in beats per minute and frequent PVCs were defined as PVC rates greater than the median value (0.43 and 0.60 PVCs per minute for exercise and recovery, respectively). Propensity-adjusted logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of developing PVCs during exercise and recovery periods associated with statin use. There were 431 subjects who developed frequent PVCs during exercise and 284 subjects had frequent recovery PVCs. After propensity score adjustment, subjects treated with statins (n = 145) had 42% lower odds of developing frequent PVCs during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.93) and 44% lower odds of developing frequent PVCs during recovery (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30-0.94). These effects were not modified by age, prior coronary disease, hypercholesterolemia, exercise-induced angina, or exercise capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with reduced odds of frequent PVCs during and after clinical exercise testing in a manner independent of associations with coronary disease or ischemia in our study population.",M1
18773672,"Premature ventricular contractions in normal children.Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) are frequently seen in children with normal cardiac findings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and the prognosis of PVCs in children with normal heart. This study included 149 children with PVC who did not have systemic or cardiac disease. Their median age at diagnosis was 10 years (range 1 month to 17 years). Seventy-six children (51%) were symptomatic. Most of the patients had unifocal PVC, whereas 5 (3.1%) of them had multifocal PVCs. The patients were evaluated by repeated Holter recordings and exercise test. In the first Holter monitoring recordings, PVCs were in the form of isolated PVC in 122 (82%) patients, couplet-triplet in 14 (9%) patients and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 13 (9%) patients. The exercise test was performed in 105 (70.5%) patients. The frequency of PVCs decreased and disappeared in 65 (61.9%) children, increased in 8 (7.6%), and were unchanged during exercise in 32 (30.5%). There was no difference between the groups according to exercise response regarding PVC quantity. Fifty-two of 149 children (35%) were followed up for a median period of 22 months. After follow-up, PVCs of 25 of the 52 patients (48.1%) decreased and disappeared. We did not find any correlation between the frequency of PVC and treatment, age, gender or the PVC frequency decrease with exercise. In conclusion, PVCs in normal children have benign prognosis and during follow-up a considerable percent show improvement.",M1
18692298,"Transmitral flow velocity-contour variation after premature ventricular contractions: a novel test of the load-independent index of diastolic filling.The new echocardiography-based, load-independent index of diastolic filling (LIIDF) M was assessed using load-/shape-varying E-waves after premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>). Twenty-six PVCs in 15 subjects from a preexisting simultaneous echocardiography-catheterization database were selected. Perturbed load-state beats, defined as the first two post-PVC E-waves, and steady-state E-waves, were subjected to conventional and model-based analysis. M, a dimensionless index, defined by the slope of the peak driving-force vs. peak (filling-opposing) resistive-force regression, was determined from steady-state E-waves alone, and from load-perturbed E-waves combined with a matched number of subsequent beats. Despite high degrees of E-wave shape variation, M derived from load-varying, perturbed beats and M derived from steady-state beats alone were indistinguishable. Because the peak driving-force vs. peak resistive-force relation determining M remains highly linear in the extended E-wave shape and load variation regime observed, we conclude that M is a robust LIIDF.",M1
18577814,"ECG-edit function in multidetector-row computed tomography coronary arteriography for patients with arrhythmias.BACKGROUND: ECG-gating is necessary for cardiac computed tomography, but is not suitable for arrhythmias, so the aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the ECG-edit function for this purpose. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 1,221 patients undergoing 64-row multidetector-row computed tomography coronary angiography (coronary MDCT), 123 patients (28 atrial fibrillation (Af), 39 premature atrial contractions (PAC), 42 premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>), 3 PAC + PVC, 10 sinus arrhythmias (SA), and a second-degree atrioventricular block (2 degrees AVB)) had arrhythmias necessitating the ECG-edit function. Short R-R interval was deleted and mid-diastolic phases were selected from the long R-R intervals using the  R+absolute time  method. In the present study, the reconstructed images were evaluated using a triple-grade scale A-C, representing excellent, acceptable, and unacceptable image quality. Image quality, categorized as A, B and C, respectively, was 50%, 36% and 14% for the 28 patients with Af; 56%, 36% and 8% for the 39 PAC patients, and 65%, 33% and 2% in the 42 PVC patients. None of the scans of the PAC + PVC, SA, and 2 degrees AVB patients was ranked as C. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG-edit function is useful for reconstructing coronary MDCT images in many arrhythmias, and provides clinically acceptable images in most cases.",M1
18503235,"Successful radiofrequency catheter ablation for electrical storm of ventricular fibrillation in a patient with Brugada syndrome.The case of a 41-year-old man with Brugada syndrome (BS) who suffered electrical storms (ES) of ventricular fibrillation (VF) is presented. Although intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (ISP) suppressed the VF occurrence, he consistently experienced recurrence of VF following discontinuation of ISP infusion. Quinidine and cilostazol were ineffective. An analysis of VF episodes on electrocardiogram monitoring revealed that the QRS morphology of the first beat of all VF episodes was identical to that of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) with a left bundle branch-block morphology and inferior axis, which occurred repetitively before the episodes of VF and were recorded throughout the day. In addition, stored electrograms from the implantable cardioverter defibrillator showed that the first beat of all VF episodes had the same morphology. On electrophysiological study, the VF-triggering PVC was found to originate from the posterior portion of the right ventricular outflow tract area and their elimination, which was achieved with radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA), resulted in the suppression of ES. Although several other PVCs were still observed, the patient has been free of VF during the 29-month follow-up period. This case indicates that RFCA of VF-triggering PVCs may be useful in the treatment of drug-resistant ES in patients with BS.",M1
18460547,"Natural history of ventricular premature contractions in children with a structurally normal heart: does origin matter?AIMS: Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) are thought to be innocent in children with normal hearts, especially if they disappear during exercise. The aim of our study was to study the natural history of PVCs in childhood and whether there is a difference between PVCs originating from the right [premature ventricular contraction with left bundle branch block (PVC-LBBB)] or the left ventricle [premature ventricular contraction with right bundle branch block (PVC-RBBB)]. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated children with frequent PVCs and anatomically normal hearts (n= 59; 35M/24F) by 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, Holter recording, and an exercise test. Age at the first visit was 7.1 +/- 4.3 years (mean +/- SD), and follow-up was 3.1 +/- 3.1 years. We could evaluate each child for 2.5 +/- 1.5 times. Premature ventricular contraction with left bundle branch block was seen in 41% of the children; PVC-RBBB in 36%; and undetermined in 23%. Mean percentage PVCs in the Holter recording decreased (14.3 +/- 13.7% in the age group 1-3 years to 4.8 +/- 7.2% in the age group &gt;OR=16 years; P= 0.08). Mean percentage PVC-LBBB did not change (12.3 +/- 21.4 vs. 11.7 +/- 5.5%), whereas PVC-RBBB decreased (16.3 +/- 4.2 to 0.6 +/- 1.4%; P &lt; 0.02). CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is a difference in the natural history between PVC-LBBB and PVC-RBBB in children with an anatomically normal heart. Premature ventricular contraction with right bundle branch block disappears during childhood. Follow-up of these children seems not necessary. Premature ventricular contraction with left bundle branch block does not disappear and, therefore, it may be necessary to follow these children even during adulthood.",M1

Electrocardiography and 24 h Holter monitoring revealed multiple premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>), and echocardiography demonstrated significant left ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment. After further investigation it was concluded that this cardiomyopathy was secondary to the observed multiple PVCs and that these represented a potential target for treatment. INVESTIGATIONS: Electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, 24 h Holter monitoring, coronary angiography, tilt testing and invasive electrophysiological testing using a multielectrode array catheter.

18357428,"Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate turbulence parameters: parallel responses to orthostasis.Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>-s) induce baroreflex mediated arterial pressure and heart rate fluctuations. PVC-related RR interval fluctuations detected on Holter ECG recordings could be characterized by the heart rate turbulence (HRT) parameters, including early post-extrasystolic acceleration, described by turbulence onset, and late deceleration, described by turbulence slope (TS). We have determined the increasing and decreasing spontaneous baroreflex sequence sensitivity (up- and down-BRS) parameters in supine and in upright position in 12 patients with VVI pacemaker while in sinus rhythm. Five-five premature ventricular pacemaker extrastmuli were also applied in both body positions and HRT parameters were calculated. Up- and down-BRS values showed a very close relationship with TS both in the supine (R = 0.94, P &lt; 0.001 and R = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001, respectively), and upright position (R = 0.96, P &lt; 0.001, and R = 0.94, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The BRS indices decreased significantly upon tilting, which was paralleled by a significant decrease in TS (from 21.6 to 13.9 ms/cycle, P = 0.02). Our findings confirm the close association between TS and spontaneous BRS indices. The relationship is further supported by the similar postural behavior of these parameters. Our results suggest that the confounding effect of posture should be considered when analyzing Holter recordings.",M1

18313593,"Relationship of frequent postinfarction premature ventricular complexes to the reentry circuit of scar-related ventricular tachycardia.BACKGROUND: Postinfarction reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) is usually scar-related. However, the sites of origin of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) in the setting of healed myocardial infarction have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the site of origin of frequent PVCs in postinfarction patients with VT and to determine the relationship to VT exit sites. METHODS: Mapping and catheter ablation were performed in 13 consecutive patients (12 men, mean age 62 +/- 8 years, mean ejection fraction 0.32 +/- 0.12) with prior myocardial infarction, sustained monomorphic VT, and &gt;10 PVCs/h. The mean PVC burden was 12% +/- 11% on a 24-hour Holter monitor. Electroanatomical left ventricular voltage maps were constructed during sinus rhythm to identify scars. Endocardial activation maps of the PVCs were correlated with the voltage maps, and the most prevalent PVCs were ablated. The effect of PVC ablation on the inducibility of VT was determined. RESULTS: Seventeen sustained monomorphic VTs were reproducibly inducible. There were a total of 34 different PVC morphologies. The site of origin was identified for 18 of the 34 PVC morphologies in 12 of 13 patients. The 18 PVCs for which the site of origin could be identified accounted for 89% of the PVC burden in these patients. The site of PVC origin was in the infarct scar in 11 patients, the border zone in 1 patient, and unidentifiable in 1 patient. The site of PVC origin corresponded to the VT exit site for 14 of 17 reproducibly inducible VTs. The PVCs that were successfully mapped were ablated, and this rendered VT no longer inducible. CONCLUSION: Postinfarction PVCs usually arise from the infarct scar, and their site of origin often corresponds to the exit site of a reentrant VT. Therefore, catheter ablation of the PVCs often is associated with the loss of inducible VT.",M1
18294486,"Association of premature ventricular complexes with central aortic pressure indices and pulse wave velocity.BACKGROUND: Although premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>) occurs frequently, its predisposing factors have rarely been studied. We examined the connection between PVC and aortic stiffness. METHODS: We recruited 200 consecutive patients (&lt; 50 years, 95 men, mean age 36 +/- 10 years) who received a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography examination for palpitation and PVC loads. Muscular artery pulse wave velocity (PWVm) and 4 main aortic pressure indices-augmented pressure, augmentation index (AI(x)), AI(x) corrected for a steady heart rate of 75 beat/min, and the extra workload-were measured, and atherosclerosis risk was evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-three (42%) patients had no PVC loads; 58 (29%) patients had low loads (&lt; 24 beat/d), and 59 (29%) had high loads (&gt; or = 24 beat/d). Only age and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with PVC loads. Using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, we found that AI(x) (odds ratio [OR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.20-2.91, P = .005); augmented pressure (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-2.43, P = .042); AI(x) corrected for a steady heart rate of 75 beat/min (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.18-2.82, P = .007); and PWVm (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.19, P = .021) were independent factors for PVC loads. CONCLUSION: Increased central aortic pressure indices as well as PWVm were associated with increased PVC loads in young patients undergoing 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. Central aortic properties probably contributed to the occurrence of PVC.",M1
18234010,"Frequent premature ventricular complexes originating from the right ventricular outflow tract are associated with left ventricular dysfunction.BACKGROUND: Recent case series have shown reversal of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after catheter ablation of frequent premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the prevalence of patients with frequent RVOT PVCs (&gt; or =10 per hour) and LV dysfunction. METHODS: RVOT PVC was defined as PVC with left bundle branch block morphology and inferior axis on a 12-lead ECG. We included patients with frequent RVOT PVCs on 24-hours Holter monitor who had a recent evaluation of LV function. Patients with structural heart disease, including obstructive coronary artery disease, were excluded. Patients were divided into three groups based on the number of PVCs (&lt;1000/24 hour, 1000-10,000/24 hour, &gt; or =10,000/24 hour), and the prevalence of LV dysfunction was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Our analysis included 108 patients: 24 patients had &lt;1000PVCs/24 hour, 55 patients had 1000-10,000PVCs/24 hour, and 29 patients had &gt; or =10,000PVCs/24 hour. The prevalence of LV dysfunction was 4%, 12%, and 34%, respectively (P = 0.02). With logistic regression analysis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was an independent predictor of LV dysfunction with odds ratio of 3.6 (1.3-10.1). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significant association between frequent RVOT PVCs and LV dysfunction in patients without structural heart disease.",M1

METHODS: RFCA was performed in 58 patients (10 with VT and 48 with PVC, 5 patients with VT from RVOT under the guidance of non-contact mapping system Ensite3000). VT or PVC originated from LVOT in 15 patients (12 out of 15 from left sinus of Valsalva) and RVOT in 43 patients. RESULTS: (1) R wave in II, III, aVF leads was the common characteristics of VT or PVC originated from LVOT and RVOT and difference in wave duration index and R/S-wave amplitude ratio in V(1) or V(2) could be used to define VT and PVC originated from LVOT or RVOT. (2) Ablation was successful in 55 out of 58 patients (9 patients with the 2nd ablation, evaluated as arrhythmia-free at 3 months post ablation without medication) and failed in 3 patients. One patient developed pericardial tamponade during ablation and recovered without complication after related treatments. CONCLUSIONS: RFCA is an effective, safe and curative therapy for VT or PVC originated from LVOT and RVOT. Non-contact mapping system (Ensite3000) is a safe and reliable tool to guide mapping and ablation in patients with complex VT and unstable hemodynamics.",M1

However, the analyses of HRT and BPT are based on the prevalence of PVC. In this study the spontaneous HRT and BPT after most premature normal beats (MPNB) was investigated in comparison to HRT and BPT after PVC. ECG and blood pressure were recorded from 91 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 45 healthy subjects (REF). In 69% of DCM and 33% of REF data sets PVCs were present. HRT and BPT were determined for all patients with PVC as well as in all patients triggered by MPNB. Univariate statistical analysis of the comparison between DCM and REF revealed similar results for HRT/BPT after PVC and MPNB. In conclusion, HRT and BPT triggered by PVC might be substituted by spontaneous HRT and BPT after MPNB. In contrast to the HRT and BPT after PVC, an increased number of data sets can be included in the analysis and may lead to an enhancement in risk stratification in different cardiac diseases.",M1
17940858,"Reversal of dilated cardiomyopathy by the elimination of frequent left or right premature ventricular contractions.BACKGROUND: RF ablation of frequent premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) has recently been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) systolic function and dimensions in a few patients, however mainly when they originated from the right ventricular outflow tract. METHODS: RF ablation was performed at various ventricular locations in six consecutive patients with frequent, isolated PVC associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Baseline clinical status, PVC counts, LV ejection fraction (EF) and end-diastolic diameter (EDD) were recorded at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: PVC ablation was performed in the right ventricle in four patients, the left ventricle in two patients. Before RF ablation, five patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I, and one patient was in class II. After RF ablation, the mean PVC count/24 h decreased from 17,717 +/- 7,100 to 268 +/- 366 (p = 0.006) while LVEF increased from 42 +/- 2.5% to 57 +/- 3% (p = 0.0001) and LVEDD decreased from 60.0 +/- 3.5 to 54.0 +/- 3.7 mm (p = 0.0009). The clinical status normalized with regression of palpitations and NYHA class. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of frequent isolated PVC in patients with DCM with RF can normalize the clinical status and LV systolic function and dimensions, regardless of the morphology or origin of the PVC.",M1
17879025,"Evaluation of left ventricular diastolic functions in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions from right ventricular outflow tract.This study was sought to examine the effects of repetitive monomorphic premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. Thirty-three symptomatic patients (Study group, 10 males, mean age 40 +/- 8 years) with normal LV systolic function and repetitive PVCs originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT-PVCs) on 24-h Holter monitoring, and 30 healthy controls (Control group, 9 males, mean age 37 +/- 9 years) were enrolled in the study. None of the patients had structural heart disease. Diastolic function was assessed by echocardiographic mitral inflow pattern and tissue Doppler imaging. The study group displayed a lower E/A ratio, longer isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), and longer E-wave deceleration time (EDT). In the study group 13 patients showed impaired relaxation. While mean values of the systolic velocity (Sa), early diastolic velocity (Ea), and early/late diastolic velocity (Ea/Aa) ratio were significantly lower in the study group, the Aa velocity and E/Ea ratio were significantly higher. Ea velocity was &lt;10 cm/s in 7 study patients. Mitral inflow pattern and Ea velocity was normal in all controls. Significant correlations were found between ventricular premature beats percentage and early to late transmitral flow velocity ratio, EDT, IVRT, Ea velocity, the Ea/Aa ratio, and the E/Ea ratio. In multivariate analysis, total PVC count and age were found to be independent predictors of impaired relaxation. These results suggest that repetitive monomorphic RVOT-PVCs lead to abnormalities of LV diastolic function that may contribute to clinical symptoms in patients with structurally normal hearts.",M1
17666562,"Premature ventricular complex-induced chronic cough and cough syncope.The present case study reports a case of chronic cough and cough syncope associated with frequent premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>). Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG monitoring led to the suspicion of PVC-induced cough. A coincidence between PVCs and episodes of cough was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. After exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic cough and cough syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. Premature ventricular complexes should be considered as a cause of chronic cough and cough syncope and an interdisciplinary cooperation can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment of this condition.",M1
17652904,"Frequent premature ventricular contractions induced by itraconazole.Itraconazole is widely used to treat onychomycosis because of its significant therapeutic effects. An otherwise healthy 30-year-old man treated with itraconazole developed frequent premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>). He presented with a dry cough and palpitation. The results of 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) were essentially normal, but Holter ECG revealed 17,484 (18%) uniform PVC, including 4 short runs among 96,930 beats/day. Another Holter ECG after withdrawing itraconazole revealed 1,032 premature atrial contractions but no PVC. The corrected QT interval was 0.39 s without itraconazole, 0.41 s with itraconazole, and 0.43 s when multiple PVC were documented. Itraconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 that is involved in fungal cell membrane formation, interrupts human cytochrome P450A4 in the liver and causes adverse interactions with various drugs such as antiarrythmics, but its cardiac side-effects are obscure. Both patients and physicians should be aware that itraconazole can cause PVC as a side-effect.",M1
17599686,"Noncontact mapping of small pulmonary artery potentials preceding ectopy from the right ventricular outflow tract.Idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia typically originates from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). However, it also may originate from above the pulmonic valve. We describe a patient with a 2-year history of symptoms of palpitations associated with premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) in whom radiofrequency catheter ablation at the PVC exit site in the lateral RVOT failed despite the presence of several favorable criteria. However, using a multiple electrode array catheter, we demonstrated above the pulmonic valve clear evidence of low-amplitude preceding electrical activity ( blue ghost ) that swept 3 cm inferolaterally over 20 ms to the previously identified lateral RVOT exit. Catheter mapping even at 128x gain demonstrated only very-low-amplitude potentials at this site, and pacing was unable to capture the ventricle from this region. However, ablation at this site immediately terminated the arrhythmia, and the patient has remained PVC-free after 1 year. This case supports the existence of previously hypothesized myocardial sleeves above the pulmonary valve that may be responsible for RVOT tachycardia and shows that they can be detected using noncontact mapping.",M1
17599667,"Radiofrequency ablation of frequent, idiopathic premature ventricular complexes: comparison with a control group without intervention.BACKGROUND: Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) usually are considered benign, even when frequent. However, case reports have demonstrated a possible link between frequent PVCs and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. In addition, frequent PVCs recently were demonstrated to be associated with increased LV dimensions and cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Among 60 consecutive patients with idiopathic, frequent PVCs (&gt;10/hour), a reduced LV ejection fraction (EF; mean 34% +/- 13%) was present in 22 (37%) patients. Patients with decreased LV function had a greater PVC burden on a 24-hour Holter monitor than patients with normal EF (37% +/- 13% vs. 11% +/- 10% of all QRS complexes; P &lt;.0001). There was a significant inverse correlation between the PVC burden and the EF before ablation (r = 0.73, P &lt;.0001). RESULTS: The PVCs originated in the right ventricular outflow tract in 31 (52%) of 60 patients, the LV outflow tract in 9 (15%) of 60 patients, and in other sites in 13 (22%) of 60 patients. The site of PVC origin could not be determined in seven patients. Ablation was completely successful in 48 (80%) patients. In patients with an abnormal EF before ablation, LV function normalized in 18 (82%) of 22 patients from a baseline of 34% to 59% +/- 7% (P &lt;.0001) within 6 months. In the four patients in whom ablation was ineffective, the EF further declined from 34% +/- 10% to 25% +/- 7% (P = .06) during follow-up. In a control group of 11 patients with a similar PVC burden (30% +/- 8%) and a reduced EF (28% +/- 13%) who did not undergo ablation, the EF remained unchanged in 10/11 patients over 19 +/- 17 months of follow-up and one patient underwent heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: LV dysfunction in the setting of frequent, idiopathic PVCs may represent a form of cardiomyopathy that can be reversed by catheter ablation of the PVCs.",M1

METHODS: A prospective study with 30 consecutive patients (mean age 40 +/- 13 years, 25 females), with no apparent structural cardiopathy, with very frequent (mean density of 1,263 +/- 593/h) RVOT-PVC, symptomatic for more than one year (mean = 74 months) and resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs (3 +/- 1.7, including beta-blockers), who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation. RESULTS: After the first procedure, there were 23 initial successful cases (76.6%) and 7 initial failures (23.4%). Four patients experienced relapses, two of whom did not undergo the second procedure. The second procedure was carried out in 9 patients (7 initial failures and 2 relapses), and there was success in 5 additional patients, one of them by epicardial access. The final success rate was 80% (24/30), and there were no major complications. After a mean follow-up of 14 +/- 6 months, in the successful group there was a reduction greater than 90% in density of premature ventricular contractions (PVC) (24/24; p&lt;0.0001) and a resulting absence of symptoms in the majority of patients (23/24; p&lt;0.001).

17341389,"Heart rate turbulence parameters correlate with post-premature ventricular contraction changes in muscle sympathetic activity.BACKGROUND: Heart rate turbulence (HRT) has been shown to be vagally mediated with a strong correlation to baroreflex indices. However, the relationship between HRT and peripheral sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) after a premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the relationship between HRT and the changes in peripheral SNA after PVCs. METHODS: We recorded postganglionic muscle SNA during electrocardiogram monitoring in eight patients with spontaneous PVCs. Fifty-two PVCs were observed and analyzed for turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). SNA was quantified during (1) the dominant burst after the PVC (dominant burst area) and (2) the 10 seconds after the dominant burst (postburst SNA). RESULTS: The mean TO was 0.1% +/- 4.6%, and the mean TS was 6.1 +/- 6.6. The dominant burst area negatively correlated with TO (r = -0.50, P = .0002). The postburst SNA showed a significant positive correlation with TO (r = 0.44, P = .001) and a negative correlation with TS (r = -0.42, P = .002). These correlations remained significant after controlling for either the PVC coupling interval or the left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the relationship between perturbations in HRT and pathology in the sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system. Future studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic role of baroreflex control of sympathetic activity in patients with structural heart disease.",M1
17341385,"Electrophysiologic characteristics of anger-triggered arrhythmias.BACKGROUND: Anger can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Determining electrophysiologic characteristics of anger-triggered arrhythmias may help elucidate the mechanisms that link emotion and arrhythmia. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the morphology and initiation pattern between ventricular arrhythmias that are triggered by anger and those that are not. METHODS: At the time of shock, patients with ICDs recorded levels of defined mood states preceding the shock in a diary. Stored intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) were retrieved and analyzed in relation to corresponding mood states. The EGMs from 56 appropriate shocks in 24 patients (18 male, mean age 66 years, 74% with coronary artery disease) were reviewed and analyzed for morphology, mechanism of initiation (sudden onset vs. premature ventricular contraction [<e>PVC</e>]), pause dependence, and other characteristics. RESULTS: Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was more common in anger-triggered events, occurring in three (37.5%) of eight anger-triggered events compared with five (10.4%) of 48 of non-anger-triggered events (P &lt;.05). Anger-triggered events were more likely to have PVC initiation, occurring in eight (100%) of eight, compared with 30 (68%) of 44 of non-anger-triggered events (P &lt;.05). More anger-triggered events were pause dependent: five (62.5%) of eight versus seven (15%) of 37 non-anger-related events (P &lt;.01). No difference in response to initial therapy was observed in anger-triggered arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: Ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the setting of anger are more likely pause dependent and polymorphic. This suggests that in predisposed populations anger may create an arrhythmogenic substrate susceptible to more disorganized rhythms, a possible mechanism linking emotion and sudden death.",M1

He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet. Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. He was discharged on 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC. Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-arrhythmic effect, especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases.",M1
17153208,"Robust neural-network-based classification of premature ventricular contractions using wavelet transform and timing interval features.Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classification is essential to timely diagnosis of dangerous heart conditions. Specifically, accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) is imperative to prepare for the possible onset of life-threatening arrhythmias. Although many groups have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting PVC beats, results have generally been limited to relatively small data sets. Additionally, many of the highest classification accuracies (&gt; 90%) have been achieved in experiments where training and testing sets overlapped significantly. Expanding the overall data set greatly reduces overall accuracy due to significant variation in ECG morphology among different patients. As a result, we believe that morphological information must be coupled with timing information, which is more constant among patients, in order to achieve high classification accuracy for larger data sets. With this approach, we combined wavelet-transformed ECG waves with timing information as our feature set for classification. We used select waveforms of 18 files of the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, which provides an annotated collection of normal and arrhythmic beats, for training our neural-network classifier. We then tested the classifier on these 18 training files as well as 22 other files from the database. The accuracy was 95.16% over 93,281 beats from all 40 files, and 96.82% over the 22 files outside the training set in differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats.",M1

In symptomatic patients, radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) can be effective, either from endocardial or from epicardial sites. A 50-year-old patient, with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, left bundle branch block (LBBB), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, received a biventricular implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) in 2002. Despite drug therapy, PVCs were frequent (21.019/24 h) including prolonged runs, prompting ICD intervention. Premature ventricular complexes showed an inferior axis morphology, with an R/S ratio in V3&gt;1, suggesting an LVOT origin. Despite the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device, successful RFCA was performed through the anterior venous branch, with a favourable clinical outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first case describing epicardial RFCA of a PVC focus from cardiac veins in the presence of a CRT device.",M1
17004338,"Effect of deep breathing at six breaths per minute on the frequency of premature ventricular complexes.Although the effect of reflex increase in vagal tone on the frequency of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVC</e>) is known, the effect of timed deep breathing on the frequency of PVC has not been reported. We serendipitously discovered that deep breathing at six breaths per minute abolished PVC in an 18-year-old female with frequent PVC, anxiety, and palpitations. In five of a series of 10 consecutive patients with frequent (&gt; or = 10/min) unifocal PVC, deep breathing at 6 breaths/min reduced the frequency of PVC by at least 50%. This is possibly due to increased vagal modulation of sinoatrial and atrioventricular node. However, factors predicting the response to deep breathing, and the mechanisms involved need to be studied in a larger number of patients.",M1
16780261,"[Echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging in assessment of haemodynamics in patients with idiopathic, premature ventricular complexes]Premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVC</e>) in patients without organic heart disease may be associated with severe symptoms and haemodynamic disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate haemodynamics during PVC by echocardiography (ECHO) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40 consecutive patients (mean age 55 +/- 15) with frequent, idiopathic PVC were included into analysis. Patients were included if they had at least 2500 PVC on 24 - hour Holter monitoring (mean: 12124 +/- 6851, range: 2560 - 28677). Parameters of blood flow at the inflow and outflow tracts of the right and left ventricle (LV) as well as TDI of mitral annulus were recorded during sinus rhythm (S), PVC and sinus rhythm following PVC (post-PVC). RESULTS: LV stroke volume (SV) in PVC correlated with PVC coupling interval (r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.01). The absence of SV was observed in PVC with coupling interval below 400 ms. Significant differences in SV and duration of cardiac cycle periods between PVC, S and post-PVC were found. Peak systolic velocity (Sm) derived from TDI in PVC was significantly decreased (4.08 +/- 2.04 cm/s) compared to Sm in S (9.35 +/- 1.26 cm/s) and in post-PVC (9.58 +/- 1.26 cm/s) in all studied patients (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with frequent, symptomatic, idiopathic PVC severe haemodynamic disturbances may be recorded by ECHO. Dysfunction of LV systolic movement is revealed by TDI.",M1

A single premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>) induced ventricular tachycardia (VT), which degenerated to VF reproducibly. This PVC was eliminated by catheter ablation at the left ventricular posteroseptal region where double Purkinje potentials preceding the ventricular wave had been recorded. The electrical storm disappeared, and programmable stimulation failed to induce any tachyarrhythmias after the ablation. A Purkinje fiber network-related PVC served as a trigger and as a substrate for VT and VF in a case of ACS with HF.",M1

The proposed model is tested on two types of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats, the normal case beat and the premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) one. Basically, the model is constituted of N Gaussians where their corresponding parameters are estimated by optimising a specific criterion. The modelling technique has been validated using MIT/BIH databases. As a result of this study, we show that a normal beat can be modelled using 18 parameters and only 15 parameters are needed to reconstruct the PVC one.",M1
16258941,"Beat-to-beat blood pressure analysis after premature ventricular contraction indicates sensitive baroreceptor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Extrasystoles occur in normal subjects but are significant more frequently (16.25% vs. 55%; chi(2) = 19.3; P &lt; 0.001) seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The extrasystolic decreases in stroke volume and systolic pressure activate sympathetic vasomotor innervation and lead to a blood pressure increase for a few heartbeats. The purpose of this study was to prove whether the short time analysis of this blood pressure regulation allows the assessment of sympathetic neurocirculatory function. Records of noninvasive blood pressure monitoring were reviewed from 40 PD patients and 80 controls. A battery of cardiovascular autonomic tests, including Valsalva maneuver, tilt-table testing, echocardiography, and cardiac scintigraphy with [(123)I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine were performed. Fifty-five percent of the PD patients had at least one premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) in 10 minutes lying supine at rest. After every PVC (13 PVCs) recorded from normal subjects, we found an increase in systolic blood pressure above base line with a maximum at the seventh heart beat. In all of the 22 PD patients, the systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased less than baseline in every PVC from the second to the ninth postextrasystolic beat (P &lt; 0.001). In both groups, the extrasystolic fall in blood pressure was on average approximately 22%. The postextrasystolic potentiation did not differ (5.3% vs. 4.4%, not significant). If a PVC occurs, the analysis of short-time blood pressure regulation is a sensitive tool for baroreceptor reflex function. The advantage of this method results from the independence of patients cooperation and the high sensitivity to prove a sympathetic neurocirculatory failure within 10 heart beats.",M1
16247211,"Multicenter survey on the validity of the CD-ROM guideline for antiarrhythmic drug therapy produced by the Japanese Circulation Society and the Japanese Society on Electrocardiology: preliminary report of the survey of the Japanese guideline for Arrhythmia Management By Individual Therapy (J-GAMBIT).BACKGROUND: A multicenter investigational survey (Japanese Guideline for Arrhythmia Management By Individual Therapy) was conducted to evaluate the validity of using CD-ROM guidelines vs physician choice for the selection of antiarrhythmic drugs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF, n=274) or premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>, n=216) were enrolled. The rate of concordance for drug selection between the treating physician and the CD-ROM was 216 of 274 patients (78.8%) with PAF. Of these, 168 (61.3%) were concordant for first-line agents and the remaining 48 (17.5%) were concordant for second-line agents. The concordance for the treatment of PVC was 154/216 cases (71.3%). Of these, 106 (49.1%) were concordant for first-line agents and the remaining 48 (22.2%) were concordant for second-line agents. Nonconcordance for PAF therapy was more likely to occur for patients with underlying heart disease (p&lt;0.05), depressed cardiac function (p&lt;0.001), and with more frequent ECG abnormalities and renal dysfunction. These differences were not seen in patients with PVC. CONCLUSION: The CD-ROM guidelines appear to be valid in the selection of antiarrhythmic drugs for both PAF and PVC, but their usefulness is influenced by the patient's clinical characteristics.",M1
16231572,"[Characterization of premature ventricular contraction initiating ventricular fibrillation]The aim of this study is to characterize the electrocardiographic features of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) from different anatomical region that trigger ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS AND RESULTS: 36 consecutives patients (20 males, 42+/-14 yrs) undergoing VF ablation from 7 centres were studied (22 with idiopathic VF, 4 associated with a long QT syndrome, 3 with Brugada syndrome, 4 with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and 3 associated with other substrate). Mapping of these PVC showed 2 different origins, which were then confirmed by ablation: right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) (22%) and peripheral Purkinje network (81%). One patient had PVC from both origins (Brugada). RVOT PVC were frequent but had triggered only 5+/-5 episodes of VF for 26+/-33 months. Purkinje PVC were more likely to be present during electrical storm with 18+/-28 episodes of VF for 33+/-45 months. Right Purkinje PVC have a left bundle branch block with superior axis morphology whereas left Purkinje ones have a right bundle branch block. The axis of activation showed variation from inferior to superior depending on the area of origin from the Purkinje network and the exit site to the myocardium. However Purkinje PVC were characterized by short QRS duration (126+/-18 vs 145+/-13ms for RVOT PVC; p=0.05). In addition the coupling interval was significantly shorter compared to RVOT PVC (292+/-45 vs 358+/-37ms respectively; p=0.005). CONCLUSION: PVC initiating VF demonstrate specific electrocardiographic features that facilitate determination of their origin. Ablation of these typical PVC is feasible in order to reduce ICD shock.",M1
16168814,"Late potentials and ventricular arrhythmias in acromegaly.BACKGROUND: Sudden death and increased prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias have already been described in acromegaly. Although late potentials (LPs) have been proved to be a new technique in detecting patients at risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias its use in acromegaly is still unknown. METHODS: We studied 70 acromegalic patients [32 males, 38 females; age 49+/-12 years (mean+/-S.D.)] and 70 control subjects age- and sex-matched [(35 males and 35 females; 46+/-12 years (mean+/-S.D.)]. Besides hormonal tests, we performed the following cardiovascular investigations: ECG, 24-h ECG Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) time-domain analysis. RESULTS: LPs occurrence was significantly higher in acromegalic patients as compared to the control group (22.9% vs. 2.9%; p=0.001). A greater duration of disease in patients with positive LPs compared to negative ones was pointed out (18 vs. 12 years; p=0.024). In the group of acromegalic patients with positive LPs we observed a significant association with premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) detected by means of 24-h Holter ECG recording (13 out of 15 patients: 86.7%; p=0.024). The positivity or negativity of LPs proved to be significantly associated with Lown scale PVC trends recorded by 24-h Holter ECG (p=0.014). In the group of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy a significant and pathological worsening of SAECG signals (QRS, LAS, RMS) was documented. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a higher prevalence of LPs in acromegaly which significantly correlated with Lown scale of PVCs.",M1
16061129,"Prevention of ventricular extrasystole by mexiletine in patients with normal QT intervals is associated with a reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization.BACKGROUND: Antiarrhythmic potential of mexiletine in patients with congenital and acquired long-QT syndrome (LQTS) has been attributed to a reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR). A similar mechanism could be involved in the antiarrhythmic activity of the drug in patients with normal QT intervals, but the issue remains to be investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 24-h Holter ECG recordings from 17 patients in sinus rhythm showing premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) with normal QT intervals (age, 62+/-10 years, mean+/-S.D.). Treatment of the patients with oral mexiletine (300 mg/day for 21-40 days) resulted in a significant reduction of PVCs (from 13899+/-18887 to 6949+/-12822 beats/24 h, p&lt;0.01). Rate-dependent behavior of ventricular repolarization was analyzed by plotting QT intervals (QT(peak), QT(end)), and the interval from T-wave peak to T-wave end (TPE) against preceding respective RR intervals of sinus beats. Both the QT(peak) and QT(end) tended to be shortened by mexiletine at RR intervals from 600 ms to 1000 ms, although the changes did not reach statistical significances. TPE, which reflects TDR, was shortened significantly at relatively long RR intervals (by 14+/-9% at RR of 900 ms, p&lt;0.05). There was a linear relationship between the percentage shortening of TPE and the percentage reduction of PVCs (r=0.86, p&lt;0.04). TPE&gt; or =70 ms was significantly associated with PVC suppression &gt;75% with an odds ratio of 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.36-0.98, per 1 ms increment). CONCLUSION: Inhibitory effect of mexiletine against PVCs in patients with normal QT intervals is mediated at least in part by a reduction of TDR. Mexiletine may be effective in patients exhibiting longer baseline TPE.",M1

15876853,"Electrophysiological response to dialysis: the role of dialysate potassium content and profiling.The task of dialysis therapy is, amongst other things, to remove excess potassium (K+) from the body. The need to achieve an adequate K+ removal with the risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to sudden intra-extracellular K+ gradient advises the distribution of the removal throughout the dialysis session instead of just in the first half. The aim of the study was to investigate the electrical behavior of two different K+ removal rates on myocardial cells (risk of arrhythmia and ECG alterations). Constant acetate-free biofiltration (AFB) and profiled K+ (decreasing during the treatment) AFB (AFBK) were used in a patient sample to understand, first of all, the effect on premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) and on repolarization indices [QT dispersion (QTd) and principal component analysis (PCA)]. The study was divided into two phases: phase 1 was a pilot study to evaluate K+ kinetics and to test the effect on the electrophysiological response of the two procedures. The second phase was set up as an extended cross-over multicenter trial in patient subsets prone to arrhythmias during dialysis. Phase 1: PVC increased during both AFB and AFBK but less in the latter in the middle of dialysis (298 in AFB vs. 200 in AFBK). The PVC/h in a subset of arrhythmic patients was 404 +/- 145 in AFB and 309 +/- 116 in AFBK (p = 0.0028). QT interval (QTc) prolongation was less pronounced in AFBK than in AFB. Phase 2: The PVC again increased in both AFB and AFBK but less in the latter mid-way through dialysis (79 +/- 19 AFB vs. 53 +/- 13 AFBK). Moreover, in the most arrhythmic patients the benefit accruing from the smooth K+ removal rate was more pronounced (103 +/- 19 in AFB vs. 78 +/- 13 in AFBK). CONCLUSION: It is not the K+ dialysis removal alone that can be destabilizing from an electrophysiological standpoint, but rather its removal dynamics. This is all the more evident in patients with arrhythmias who benefit from the K+ profiling during their dialysis treatment.",M1
15837259,"Radiofrequency catheter ablation of premature ventricular complexes from right ventricular outflow tract improves left ventricular dilation and clinical status in patients without structural heart disease.OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluated clinical benefits of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) for premature ventricular complexes from right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT-<e>PVC</e>) in patients without structural heart disease. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether PVC causes left ventricular (LV) dilation, which is a well-recognized precursor of LV dysfunction and heart failure, and whether eliminating PVC by RFA produces clinical benefits in patients with RVOT-PVC. METHODS: Frequency of PVC per total heart beats by 24-h Holter monitoring, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic internal dimension (LVDd), mitral regurgitation (MR) by echocardiogram, cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) by chest radiogram, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of 40 patients with RVOT-PVC without structural heart disease were evaluated before and 6 to 12 months after RFA. RESULTS: Before RFA, a subgroup of patients with frequent (&gt;20%) PVC demonstrated significantly enlarged LVDd and CTR, reduced LVEF, increased MR, and deteriorated NYHA functional class as compared to the subgroup with rare (&lt;20%) PVC (54 +/- 1 mm vs. 45 +/- 1 mm, 52 +/- 2% vs. 46 +/- 1%, 66 +/- 2% vs. 73 +/- 2%, 1.2 +/- 0.2 degree vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 degree, and 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, ablating RVOT-PVC readily produced the improvement of all these abnormalities (47 +/- 1 mm, 41 +/- 1%, 72 +/- 2%, 0.3 +/- 0.1 degree, and 1.0 +/- 0.0, respectively; p &lt; 0.05 compared with before RFA). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that frequent (&gt;20%) RVOT-PVC may be a possible cause of LV dysfunction and/or heart failure, and RFA produces clinical benefits in these patients.",M1
15766824,"Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia arising from the mitral annulus: a distinct subgroup of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias.OBJECTIVES: We sought to clarify the prevalence and characteristics of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia or premature ventricular contraction originating from the mitral annulus (MAVT/<e>PVC</e>). BACKGROUND: Recent case reports have presented patients with MAVT/PVC. METHODS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics and the results of electrophysiologic investigation and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) were analyzed in 352 patients with symptomatic idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (IVT)/premature ventricular contraction (PVC). RESULTS: Nineteen cases of IVT/PVC (5%) represented MAVT/PVC. Of these, 11 (58%) originated from the anterolateral portion of the mitral annulus (AL-MAVT/PVC), and 2 (11%) arose from the posterior portion (Pos-MAVT/PVC). The remaining six cases of MAVT/PVC (31%) had posteroseptal origin (PS-MAVT/PVC). In all patients, an S-wave was present in lead V(6). The QRS polarity in inferior leads and leads I and aVL was useful for differentiating AL-MAVT/PVC from Pos-MAVT/PVC or PS-MAVT/PVC. The Pos-MAVT/PVC had an Rs pattern in lead I and an R pattern in lead V(1), whereas PS-MAVT/PVC invariably had an R pattern in lead I and a negative QRS component in lead V(1). The AL-MAVT/PVC and Pos-MAVT/PVC showed a longer QRS duration than the PS-MAVT/PVC (p &lt; 0.001), and all had late-phase  notching  of the QRS complex in inferior leads. In all patients, RFCA eliminated MAVT/PVC, with no recurrences during follow-up for 21 +/- 15 months. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral annular VT/PVC is a rare but distinct subgroup of IVT/PVC. MAVT/PVC origin could be determined by ECG analysis. The AL and PS sites of the MA were preferential.",M1
15742884,"Premature ventricular contraction classification by the Kth nearest-neighbours rule.An analysis of electrocardiographic pattern recognition parameters for premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) and normal (N) beat classification is presented. Twenty-six parameters were defined: 11 x 2 for the two electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, width of the complex and three parameters derived from a single-plane vectorcardiogram (VCG). Some of the parameters include amplitudes of maximal positive and maximal negative peaks, area of absolute values, area of positive values, area of negative values, number of samples with 70% higher amplitude than that of the highest peak, amplitude and angle of the QRS vector in a VCG plane. They were measured for all heartbeats annotated as N or PVC in all 48 ECG recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Two reference sets for the Kth nearest-neighbours rule were used-global and local. The classification indices obtained with the global reference set were 75.4% specificity and 80.9% sensitivity.

15717468,"[Case of premature ventricular contraction immediately after electroconvulsive therapy in a depressive patient]A 42-year-old woman with eating disorder underwent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) under general anesthesia with thiamylal 150 mg and suxamethonium 60 mg. On her fourth ECT procedure, premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) occurred immediately after the treatment. We speculate that increased release of catecholamine by ECT and hypokalemia caused PVC. It seems that she repeated self-vomiting, because she had hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and weight loss of 3 kg in two weeks before arrhythmia episode. We conclude that in the anesthetic management of patients undergoing ECT a careful attention should be given to body weight change and serum electrolyte care before ECT because it is easy to develop electrolyte abnormality by eating disorder of self-emetic type.",M1
15571831,"Classification and mechanism of Torsade de Pointes initiation in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.AIMS: To examine the initiating mode of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 111 episodes of TdP recorded on the electrocardiograms of 24 patients with congenital LQTS, and clarified the initiating mode, the three consecutive preceding RR intervals defined as C(2), C(1), and C(0), the timing of initiating premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) and the cycle length (CL) of TdP. Three different initiating patterns were observed: (1) a  short-long-short  sequence (SLS) pattern (23 patients, 72 TdP, 65%) defined as one or more short-long cardiac cycles followed by an initiating short-coupled PVC (C(1)&gt;C(2) and C(0)), (2) an  increased sinus rate  (ISR) pattern (8 patients, 28 TdP, 25%) defined as a gradual increase in sinus rate with or without T-wave alternans (C(2)&gt;/=C(1)&gt;/=C(0)), and (3) a  changed depolarization  (CD) pattern (5 patients, 11 TdP, 10%) defined as a sudden long-coupled PVC or fusion beat followed by short-coupled PVC. The C(0) was shorter in ISR than SLS and CD (mean C(0): 488 vs. 587 and 603 ms, respectively; P&lt;0.05). Therefore, the initiating PVC appeared near the T-wave peak of the last beat before onset in ISR, while it occurred after the T-wave peak in SLS and CD. The CL of TdP was shorter in ISR than in SLS (256 vs. 295 ms, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the existence of three predominant initiating modes of TdP in patients with congenital LQTS and suggests a differential mechanism of initiation of TdP for each mode.",M1
15535192,"Ranking of pattern recognition parameters for premature ventricular contractions classification by neural networks.Detection and classification of ventricular complexes from a limited number of ECG leads is of considerable importance in critical care or operating room patient monitoring. Beat-to-beat detection allows the heart rhythm evolution to be followed and various types of arrhythmia to be recognized. A quantitative analysis is proposed of pattern recognition parameters for classification of normal QRS complexes and premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>). Twenty-six parameters have been defined: the width of the QRS complex, three vectorcardiogram parameters and 11 from two ECG leads. These parameters include: amplitudes of positive and negative peaks, area of positive and negative waves, various time-interval durations, amplitude and angle of the QRS vector, etc. They are measured for all QRS complexes annotated as 'normals' and 'PVCs' from the 48 ECG recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Neural networks (NN) are shown to be a useful instrument for the analysis of large quantities of parameters. Separate ranking of any parameter and homogeneous group ranking (amplitude, area, interval, slope and vector) were performed. From the two ECG leads, the first three ranked parameter groups for clustering of PVCs are amplitude, slope and interval, while for N clustering they are vector, amplitude and area. Considering the entire parameter set, we obtained N = 99.7% correct detection of normal QRS complexes and PVC = 98.5% of premature ventricular complexes. The study also shows that simultaneous analysis of two ECG channels yields better accuracy compared to using a single channel: the improvement is 0.1% in the classification of N beats and 4.5% for PVC beats.",M1
15461714,"Prevalence and characteristics of idiopathic outflow tract tachycardia with QRS alteration following catheter ablation requiring additional radiofrequency ablation at a different point in the outflow tract.Subtle variations in QRS morphology occurs during idiopathic outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (OTVT), but no studies have clarified the prevalence and characteristics of the OTVT with altered QRS morphology following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA), which then require an additional RF application at a different portion of the outflow tract to abolish OTVT. Of 202 patients with a monomorphic VT or premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>) originating from the outflow tract, 6 (3%) showed changes in QRS morphology in the OTVT following RFA, requiring an additional RF application to the outflow tract at a different portion. In all six patients, RFA was applied for the first or second OTVT to a right or left ventricular endocardial site, with the other site being the left sinus of Valsalva. In each patient, OTVT before or after the changes in QRS morphology had characteristic ECG findings originating from a particular portion of the outflow tract. Changes in QRS morphology consistently included an increase or decrease in R wave amplitude in all inferior leads. Detailed continuous observation of QRS morphology in OTVT, especially R wave amplitude in inferior leads, is important for identifying changes of QRS morphology during catheter ablation. Mapping and ablation at a different portion of the outflow tract is then needed for cure.",M1
15459463,"Prevalence and electrocardiographic characteristics of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia originating in the free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract.BACKGROUND: The prevalence and ECG characteristics of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia originating in the free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) require further clarification, which was the aim of the present study of 110 patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (n=34) or premature ventricular contraction (n=76; OT-VT/<e>PVC</e>) who underwent successful catheter ablation at the RVOT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten OT-VT/PVCs (9%) were ablated successfully at the free wall (FW-VT/PVC); the remaining 100 (91%) were ablated at the RVOT septum (Sep-VT/PVC). R wave amplitudes in the inferior leads were significantly smaller in FW-VT/PVC than in Sep-VT/PVC (p&lt;0.01). An RR' pattern in the inferior leads was observed significantly more often in FW-VT/PVC than in Sep-VT/PVC (p&lt;0.001). QS-wave amplitude in each of leads V(1) to V(3) was significantly deeper in FW-VT/PVC than in Sep-VT/PVC (p&lt;0.001). ECG criteria requiring an RR' pattern in all inferior leads as well as an S-wave amplitude of at least 3.0 mV in lead V(2) differentiated FW-VT/PVC from Sep-VT/PVC with high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Although FW-VT/PVC has a relatively low prevalence, it has several distinctive ECG characteristics and detailed ECG analysis can differentiate it from Sep-VT/PVC.",M1

Results of a small simulation experiment, to study small sample behaviour of a score test and a likelihood ratio test, are reported and the PVC data are analysed. Both the score and the likelihood ratio tests show good level properties. Either the score tests or the likelihood ratio tests can be used for testing the presence of treatment effect. The score tests, however, may be preferable because they use estimates of the parameters only under the null hypothesis and in the important range pi&lt;0.5 power of the score test statistic S1 is slightly better than the likelihood ratio statistic LR1.",M1
14961790,"The effect of time and of vasoactive drugs on capillary leakage induced during myocardial contrast echocardiography.BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>), capillary leakage, and petechial hemorrhage can occur during myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). The effects occur as a result of the interaction of contrast agent microbubbles and the ultrasound, but the detailed etiology of the effects is not yet clear. This study tested the hypothesis that the capillary leakage results from a physiological response to injury, which might be protracted and modulated by vasoactive drugs. METHODS: Hairless rats were anesthetized and transthoracically scanned with a diagnostic ultrasound system (GE Vingmed System V) at 1.7 MHz with 1:4 triggered frames at end systole. The scan head and rats were mounted in a 37 degrees C water bath to assure free-field conditions and placement of the heart at a similar focal distance as humans. A tail vein was cannulated for injections of Optison contrast agent, vasoactive medications, and Evans Blue dye (EB). EB was injected as a marker of capillary leakage before or after scanning. RESULTS: PVCs, petechia, and capillary leakage occurred during ultrasound exposure of microbubbles in myocardium, with no effects detected in shams. The influence of the vasoactive medications propranolol and isoproterenol on the effects did not support the hypothesis. Capillary leakage occurred during and postexposure, but diminished for EB injection 20 minutes after scanning with or without isoproterenol pretreatment. CONCLUSION: MCE induced PVCs, petechia, and capillary leakage, all of which ended immediately or within 20 minutes after the examination. Contrary to the hypothesis of a physiological mechanism, the capillary leakage appears to be primarily a mechanical effect rather than a physiological response.",M1
14764164,"Dynamics of T-U wave in patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricular outflow tract.Postextrasystolic U wave augmentation is observed in patients with long QT syndrome and those with organic heart disease. This phenomenon is considered a marker of increased risk of arrhythmia. However, the characteristics of the U wave have not been evaluated in patients with idiopathic VT originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT-VT). The present study evaluated the dynamic change in the T-U wave in patients with RVOT-VT. Holter ECGs obtained from 14 patients with RVOT-VT and 11 healthy control subjects were analyzed. The amplitude of T and U waves (Tamp and Uamp) and preceding RR intervals were measured during stable sinus rhythm (rate dependent change) and in the postextrasystolic sinus complex (pause dependent change). Uamp correlated negatively and significantly with the preceding RR interval in 13 (93%) RVOT-VT patients but in only 2 (18%) control subjects. The average value of the slope of the Uamp/RR relationship was negative (-0.22 +/- 0.10 mV/s) in the RVOT-VT group, but was positive (0.04 +/- 0.07 mV/s, P &lt; 0.001) in the control group. Pause dependent U wave augmentation was observed in 12 (86%) of 14 patients. Increased frequency of consecutive preceding premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) was associated with a larger postextrasystolic Uamp. PVC or the first ventricular beat of VT arose from near the peak of augmented U waves. The dynamic changes in the T-U wave were observed in patients with RVOT-VT. Further investigations are required to elucidate the precise role of the U wave in arrhythmogenesis in those patients.",M1
14631471,"Similarity of spontaneous and induced heart rate and blood pressure turbulence.BACKGROUND: Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a transient tachycardia-bradycardia that follows premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>). The physiology of turbulence is studied in the electrophysiology lab using induced premature ventricular stimuli but the reliability of this model for HRT is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare heart rate and blood pressure signatures of induced and spontaneous HRT. METHODS: Each patient received 10 ventricular extrastimuli at 1-min intervals. Electrocardiogram and continuous blood pressure results were digitized for 34 electrophysiology patients. RESULTS: Fifteen patients yielded at least one induced and one spontaneous analyzable PVC. Per subject, 3.6+/-2.2 spontaneous and 6.1+/-3.3 induced HRT sequences were detected. Spontaneous and inducible HRT were indistinguishable according to turbulence onset (median -1.7% versus -2.3%, P=0.09), turbulence slope (median 7.1 ms/beat versus 10.0 ms/beat, P=0.73), turbulence tachycardia (median 29 ms versus 22 ms, P=0.97) and turbulence bradycardia (45 ms versus 72 ms, P=0.60). Accompanying blood pressure signatures were indistinguishable according to initial hypotension (-0.5+/-5.9 mmHg versus 12.1+/-5.5 mmHg, P=0.19), hypertension time (7.7+/-3.6 s versus 7.8+/-1.9 s, P=0.93) and turbulence hypertension (13.5+/-5.7 mmHg versus 16.1+/-9.2 mmHg, P=0.19). Baroreflex sensitivities estimated by the spontaneous sequence method were similar for spontaneous and induced turbulence (median 7.5 ms/mmHg versus 7.2 ms/mmHg, P=0.89) and correlated with each other (r2=0.81). Heart rate and blood pressure turbulence induced in the electrophysiology laboratory were similar to those following spontaneous PVCs and induced turbulence was a valid model for study under controlled conditions.",M1
14598897,"The influence of premature ventricular contractions on left ventricular function in asymptomatic children without structural heart disease: an echocardiographic evaluation.BACKGROUND: Isolated monomorphic premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) are not uncommon in the pediatric population. The degree of cardiac dysfunction caused by PVCs in children without structural heart disease is unknown. PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of PVCs on echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) systolic function in children without structural heart disease. METHODS: Forty asymptomatic children with isolated monomorphic PVCs without structural heart disease were selected. The median age was 6 years, range of 3-12 years. The following subgroups were compared: frequent vs. infrequent PVCs (&gt; or &lt; or = 10/min); short vs. long coupling interval (RR'/RR ratio &lt; or = or &gt; 0.6); and short vs. long QT interval (QT &lt; or = or &gt; 400 ms). Using echocardiography the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF in percentage) and cardiac index (CI in L/min/m2) were measured for both normal sinus beats (SB-LVEF and CI), PVCs (PVC-LVEF and CI) and the average LVEF and CI were calculated. All values were expressed as means +/- SD. RESULTS: In all children LV dimensions and the SB-LVEF and CI were within normal limits. The PVC-LVEF (48 +/- 5) and PVC-CI (1.57 +/- 0.19) were significantly decreased and the average CI was 2.41 +/- 0.29. In 27 pts with &gt; 10 PVCs/min the average LVEF and CI decreased to 53 +/- 5 and 2.08 +/- 0.24 respectively. In 16 pts with PVCs and a short coupling interval (RR'/RR &lt; or = 0.6) the PVC-LVEF and PVC-CI was 43 +/- 0.03 and 1.50 +/- 0.14, which was significantly lower than in 24 pts with a long coupling interval (58 +/- 4, 1.88 +/- 0.11). In 11 pts with a prolonged QT interval (&gt; 400 ms) the PVC-LVEF and PVC-CI was significantly lower than in the 29 children with a shorter QT interval, 41 +/- 5 vs. 55 +/- 4 and 1.46 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.86 +/- 0.15 respectively (all p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic children with isolated monomorphic PVCs the average ejection fraction and cardiac output is markedly reduced if PVCs are frequent (&gt; 10/min), have a short coupling interval or a prolonged QT interval.",M1
14566296,"Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) with triggered ultrasound does not cause premature ventricular complexes: evidence from PB127 MCE studies.Previous studies suggest that myocardial contrast echocardiography using high mechanical index triggered ultrasound can be associated with increased frequency of the premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>). However, this association has not been systematically examined. PB127 (Point Biomedical Corp, San Carlos, Calif) is a novel microsphere designed for evaluation of myocardial perfusion with ultrasound. PB127 myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed with triggered harmonic power Doppler in early/mid diastole (mechanical index &lt;/= 1.0). A total of 71 patients (cohort A) were studied at rest and another 64 (cohort B, age 62 +/- 12.6 years) were allocated to stress. Continuous electrocardigraphy was recorded. The study evaluated premature ventricular complex frequency at baseline, during, and after infusion of PB127 (dose &lt; 0.175 mg/kg, &lt;60-minute duration). Proportions of triggered and nontriggered intervals associated with premature ventricular complex were determined. PVC frequency did not increase with PB127 infusion in either cohort (P =.572, P =.263). Proportion of triggered intervals after QRS associated with PVC was similar to proportion of untriggered intervals in cohort A (P &gt;.999) and was lower than untriggered intervals (P =.001) in B, suggesting that triggers do not cause PVC. PB127 does not cause increase PVC frequency during or after imaging with triggered ultrasound at mechanical index of 1.",M1
12914621,"Study of precursors of ventricular tachycardia from data stored in the memory of a dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator.This study was performed to examine precursors of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients who experienced a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and received appropriate therapy by ICD. From an overall consecutive population of 77 patients, 18 patients (1 woman, mean age 61.7 +/- 10.8 years) were selected for having experienced a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and received at least one appropriate ICD therapy preceded by 20 minutes of internal information. The number of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>)/min for each of the 20 minutes preceding the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the shortest coupling intervals between PVC and normal sinus beat, and the presence of short-long-short (SLS) interval sequences were examined. Data were stratified according to underlying disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and antiarrhythmic therapy. One hundred twenty-eight episodes of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia were retrieved. Rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmia (&gt;160 beats/min) were preceded by a significantly greater mean number (3.71 +/- 6.36)of PVCs than slower ventricular tachyarrhythmia (&lt;or=160 beats/min) (0.63 +/- 0.88, P = 0.0004). The mean shortest PVC coupling interval was significantly shorter in patients with (588 +/- 99 ms) versus without (643 +/- 111 ms, P = 0.03)ischemic heart disease, before episodes of rapid(527 +/- 55 ms)versus slower (636 +/- 105 ms, P = 0.0001)ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and in the absence (538 +/- 80 ms)versus the presence(620 +/- 105 ms, P = 0.006)of amiodarone. SLS sequences preceded 29% of rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmic episodes, versus 8% of the slower ventricular tachyarrhythmia (P &lt; 0.01). Significant differences were found in the characteristics of PVCs preceding ventricular tachyarrhythmic episodes in accordance to their rate and the underlying cardiomyopathy. Though insufficient in isolation, these findings may be helpful when combined with other observations to develop preventive algorithms, or to refine the programming of implantable devices.",M1

Approximately 1 week later he experienced a shock. Inspection of stored electrograms revealed that a run of nonsustained VT had initiated his ICD to charge. The episode spontaneously terminated, yet the shock was still delivered during sinus rhythm. Further inspection revealed that a critically timed <e>PVC</e> during the  second look  interval resulted in delivered therapy. Thus, inappropriate ICD therapy can result from causes other than SVT, lead malfunction, or over sensing.",M1
11933920,"The effect of propafenone on premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>): an analysis based on heart rate dependency of PVCs.The effect of 450 mg/day propafenone for two weeks on premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) was studied in combination with an assessment of heart rate (HR) dependency of PVCs using Holter ECG monitoring in patients with more than 720 PVCs per day. The PVC-HR correlation was classified into positive (P), bidirectional (B), and flat and negative (FN) correlation groups. The positive group included only patients in whom PVC frequency increased with a heart rate increase, while the bidirectional group included patients with PVCs whose frequency increased at low heart rates and decreased at high heart rates. The FN group contained both flat (PVC frequency was almost fixed regardless of heart rate changes) and negative (PVC frequency decreased as heart rate increased) correlations. The effectiveness of propafenone was 70% in the positive group and 50% in the nonpositive group which included both bidirectional (67%) and FN (0%) groups, using a &gt; 70% PVC reduction as a criterion of efficacy. From this, we concluded that propafenone is effective in patients showing either positive or bidirectional PVC-HR correlation. The coupling interval (CI) of PVCs was also prolonged by propafenone as a whole. The present study suggests that there are differences in the mechanism of PVC development in patients with flat or negative correlation and those with a positive or bidirectional correlation. Thus, this type of analysis contributes to an understanding of the action of antiarrhythmic agents, and may allow the prediction of their efficacy on PVCs.",M1
11868062,"Prevalence of premature ventricular contractions in a population of African American and white men and women: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.BACKGROUND: The distribution or the causes of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) in diverse populations are not fully known. We describe the prevalence of PVCs on a 2-minute electrocardiogram (ECG) in adults to determine whether hypertension has an important association with such PVCs. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the 15,792 individuals (aged 45-65 years) from the four US communities participating at visit 1 of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study was performed. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of PVCs with potential causal predictors of PVCs. RESULTS: Based on a 2-minute ECG, PVCs are present in &gt;6% of middle-aged adults. Increasing age, the presence of heart disease, faster sinus rates, African American ethnicity, male sex, lower educational attainment, and lower serum magnesium or potassium levels are directly related to PVC prevalence. Independently of these factors, hypertension is associated with a 23% increase in the prevalence of PVCs. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PVCs on a 2-minute ECG differs by age, ethnicity, and sex and is associated with hypertension, heart disease, faster sinus rates, electrolyte abnormalities, and lower educational attainment. Hypertension is likely to be a major cause of PVCs in adults.",M1
11555690,"Changes in frequency of premature complexes and heart rate variability related to shift work.OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether an increased risk of cardiovascular disease might be caused by increased arrhythmogeneity and by unfavourable changes in autonomic cardiac control the changes in the occurrence of premature complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) and in heart rate variability (HRV) were studied in subjects who started to work in shifts. METHODS: 1 Year changes in frequency of PVCs and HRV were measured in 49 shift workers and 22 control subjects working in daytime. All respondents were starting in a new job in integrated circuit or waste incinerator plants. RESULTS: The incidence of PVC increased significantly in shift workers over the 1 year follow up, compared with daytime workers. The frequency of ventricular extrasystoles increased in 48.9% of the shift workers, and in 27.3% of the daytime workers. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the number of nights worked and the change in PVCs was 0.33 (p=0.004). A small non-significant unfavourable change in HRV was found in both the shift and daytime workers. CONCLUSIONS: A change in arrhythmogeneity, but not in cardiac autonomic control, might explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in shift workers.",M1
11396559,"Cardiac arrhythmias in F-16 pilots during aerial combat maneuvers (ACMS): a descriptive study focused on G-level acceleration.INTRODUCTION: It is well known that acceleration during centrifuge training provokes cardiac arrhythmias. However, there is little research regarding cardiac arrhythmia during actual flight. Therefore, to identify the kinds of cardiac arrhythmias that occur in response to the Aerial Combat Maneuvers (ACM) environment, we analyzed electrocardiograms (ECG) of 35 male pilots. METHODS: ECGs were recorded from 35 pilots (mean age 31 yr, range 27-39) from 1 h before take-off to 1 h after landing. G-load was simultaneously recorded. To see the patterns of the arrhythmia as Gz force increased, ECG data of each subject were classified into three G levels: a) G-level A was &lt; +3 G; b) G-level B was &gt; or = +3 G but &lt; +6 G lasting longer than 3 s; and c) G-level C was &gt; or = +6 G lasting longer than 3 s. RESULTS: Mean total flying time of the 35 pilots was 1475 h (range 578-3300). Arrhythmias were observed in 17 of the pilots (49%) during ECG recording. Four pilots (11.4%) experienced arrhythmias before take-off, 16 pilots (45.7%) inflight and 4 pilots (11.4%) after landing. Arrhythmias were recorded in 13 of 35 pilots (37.1%) at G-level A, in 10 of 35 pilots (28.6%) at G-level B and in 1 of 21 pilots (5%) at G-level C. During flight, unifocal premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) were experienced by three of the subjects (8.6%); supraventricular premature beats (SVPB) by four subjects (11.4%), and PVCs with bigeminy by one subject (2.9%). Eight subjects (22.9%) experienced combined arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: There were no clinically significant arrhythmias recorded during ACM in these experienced pilots.",M1
11386509,"Clinical usefulness of a multielectrode basket catheter for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia originating from right ventricular outflow tract.INTRODUCTION: It often is difficult to determine the optimal ablation site for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) when the VT or premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>) does not occur frequently. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of a multielectrode basket catheter for ablation of idiopathic VT originating from the RVOT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation was performed using a 4-mm tip, quadripolar catheter in 50 consecutive patients with 81 VTs originating from the RVOT with (basket group = 25 patients with 45 VTs) or without (control group = 25 patients with 36 VTs) predeployment of a multielectrode basket catheter composed of 64 electrodes. Deployment of the multielectrode basket catheter was possible and safe in all 25 patients in the basket group. Ablation was successful in 25 (100%) of 25 patients in the basket group and in 22 (88%) of 25 patients in the control group. The total number of RF applications and the number of RF applications per PVC morphology did not differ between the two groups. However, both the fluoroscopic and ablation procedure times per PVC morphology were shorter in the basket group than in the control group (36.8+/-14.1 min vs 52.0+/-32.5 min, P = 0.04; 60.0+/-14.6 vs 81.5+/-51.2 min, P = 0.05). This difference was more pronounced in the 29 patients in whom VT or PVC was not frequently observed. CONCLUSION: The multielectrode basket catheter is safe and useful for determining the optimal ablation site in patients with idiopathic VT originating from the RVOT, especially in those without frequent VT or PVC.",M1
11341081,"Adenosine induced ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency room.While adenosine effectively terminates most supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), rare case reports have demonstrated its proarrhythmic potential, including induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The aim of this study was to define the proarrhythmic effects of adenosine in a large, unselected population. During a 5-year period, adenosine was used (average dose 9.7 mg) in the emergency room to manage 187 episodes of tachycardia in 127 patients. In two thirds of the cases, adenosine induced ventricular ectopy following successful termination of SVT, including premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVC</e>) and nonsustained VT. The adenosine induced PVCs and VT were transient and self-terminating. More than half had a right bundle branch block morphology with a superior axis that suggested an origin in the inferior left ventricular septum. In conclusion, although adenosine is commonly used in clinical practice to treat SVTs, we found that it induced PVCs and VT in two thirds of the patients. The high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias following adenosine infusion was surprising but did not require further intervention. These arrhythmias appeared to frequently originate from the inferior left ventricular septum, suggesting that this area may be particularly susceptible to the proarrhythmic effects of adenosine.",M1
11180698,"[Detection of beat-to-beat changes in high frequency components of the QRS complex using a free optimal signal averaging system: relationship with ventricular arrhythmias]In this study, we evaluated the relationship between beat-to-beat changes in high frequency components of the QRS complex and ventricular arrhythmias by using a newly developed event-related (ER) signal averaging technique. The study involved 82 patients with premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>), 56 of whom, including 16 with ventricular tachycardia (VT), were enrolled in Analysis I. In Analysis I, averaged sinus beats were classified into three patterns: 1) the sinus beat immediately before PVC (BEF); 2) that immediately after PVC (AFT); and 3) all sinus beats (ALL). Analysis II covered the remaining 26 patients, and involved five modes of event-related signal averaging, using: 1) the second beat preceding PVC (2-B); 2) the beat immediately preceding PVC (1-B); 3) the beat immediately after PVC (1-A); 4) the second beat after PVC (2-A); and 5) the beat isolated (ISO) from PVC. The filtered QRS duration (F-QRS) and the integral voltage of the terminal 40 msec (RMS 40-I) were measured using these averaging patterns. F-QRS in the VT group was longer than that in the non-VT group, but RMS 40-I was shorter. The F-QRS of BEF (1-B) was significantly longer than that of AFT (1-A). The transient difference in the F-QRS was observed in both VT and non-VT groups. This difference was almost eliminated at AFT (1-A) in the non-VT group, but was stable at AFT (1-A) in the VT group. Simultaneousely, RMS 40-I in BEF was significantly shorter than that in AFT. This transient decrease of RMS 40-I was observed in both VT and non-VT groups. Although RMS 40-I after this decrease showed a return almost to the control level at AFT in the non-VT group, it tended to remain even at AFT in the VT group. The sudden prolongation of F-QRS that occurred with the RMS 40-I decrease in BEF was related to the appearance of PVCs. We attributed the fact that these changes in F-QRS and RMS 40-I were observed even at AFT in the VT group to electrophysiologically preferable conditions for reentry.",M1
10894909,"Dependency of premature ventricular contractions on heart rate and circadian rhythms during childhood.The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify the rate dependence of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>) during childhood. A 24-hour Holter recording was performed in 16 consecutive children, aged 22 days to 11 years (mean age 5.6 years), with frequent (&gt;5,000/day), isolated monomorphic PVC. Those PVC were identified and the length of the preceding sinus cycle was measured. The values were ordered into 50-ms class intervals, and the percentage of PVC for each class was calculated and then analyzed by linear regression analysis. On the basis of the significance of the p value, and the positive or negative value of the slope, we identified a tachycardia-enhanced, a bradycardia-enhanced, and an indifferent pattern. Chronobiologic analysis was made by the cosinor method. All the patients had upper and lower limits of cycle length beyond which PVC disappeared. A tachycardia-enhanced pattern was present in 7 patients and an indifferent one in 9 patients. In the latter a second-degree polynomial correlation was systematically found. Children but not infants had a significant circadian variation in the frequency of PVC with a very variable time of highest incidence. In conclusion, it is possible to identify a circadian rhythm of PVC and a spontaneous trend between their incidence and the length of the preceding cardiac cycle in children.",M1
10875030,"Effects of intravenous dofetilide in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions: a clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Although suppression of premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) is not a predictor of mortality over the long term, the extent of PVC suppression is an important characteristic of any antiarrhythmic drug. HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to determine whether intravenous (i.v.) dofetilide has the ability to suppress PVCs in patients who have frequent occurrences. METHODS: Subjects were men and women, aged 18 to 75 years, with &gt; 30 PVCs/h on two consecutive 24-h Holter recordings while drug free, and &gt; 50 PVCs/h during a 2-hour telemetric electrocardiogram. The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled. Subjects received a single-blind, i.v. infusion of placebo and were randomized (3:1) to receive a double-blind second infusion of placebo or an infusion of dofetilide (a 15-min loading infusion of 4 g/kg followed by a 60-min maintenance infusion of 3.5 g/kg, for a total dose of 7.5 g/kg). RESULTS: Dofetilide produced an 82.6% and placebo a 2.9% median reduction in PVCs. Drug responder rate, defined as 80% reduction in PVCs, was 50% in the dofetilide group and 0% in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Intravenous dofetilide significantly reduced PVCs in patients who had &gt; 30 PVCs/h at baseline, and it produced &gt; or = 80% reduction in PVCs in 50% of all subjects.",M1
10812321,"Validation of a short rhythm strip compared to ambulatory ECG monitoring for ventricular ectopy.Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Many epidemiologic studies measure a continuous short rhythm strip to ascertain PVCs as a screening tool to identify persons at highest risk. Despite its widespread use in epidemiologic studies, the rhythm strip has not been completely validated. Therefore, a continuous 2-min rhythm strip was measured on 242 consecutive individuals referred for ambulatory ECG monitoring. Prevalence of at least one PVC on the 2-min rhythm strip was compared to a gold standard, the average number of PVCs per hr on ambulatory recording. The prevalence of any PVCs on the 2-min rhythm strip was 19%. As average PVCs per hr increased on the ambulatory ECG recording, sensitivity increased while specificity slowly decreased. Sensitivity ranged from 26-100% and specificity ranged from 81-100% across the distribution of average PVCs per hr on ambulatory monitoring. Area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of the 2-min rhythm strip compared to 24-hr results was 0.943. Area under ROC curves were not statistically different (P &gt; 0.05) by age, gender, hypertension status, or history of myocardial infarction. In this clinical population, utilizing the 2-min rhythm strip as an indicator of average PVCs per hr had excellent specificity and moderate to low sensitivity across most of the distribution of average PVCs per hr. The use of a short rhythm strip to detect PVCs may be considered useful in epidemiologic investigations of cardiovascular disease and mortality for detecting high frequency PVCs in populations. The use of a short rhythm strip as a screening tool to detect PVCs in clinical practice is not warranted, based on our findings and the existing literature. However, an awareness that PVCs on a 2-min rhythm strip consistently identify high frequency PVCs on 24-hr recordings should be helpful to clinicians.",M1
10756246,"Premature ventricular contractions during triggered imaging with ultrasound contrast.BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) were observed during triggered second harmonic imaging of a contrast agent for myocardial perfusion assessment, with continuous infusion of the contrast agent. Further investigation into the relation of this phenomenon to both ultrasound energy and the contrast agent was carried out during a subsequent bolus-versus-infusion study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two open-label studies in healthy male volunteers were performed. The initial study was a dose-response study in 10 subjects, which compared 3 infusion rates. Each volunteer received 3 continuous infusions with different infusion rates of the contrast agent for either 10 (n = 6) or 20 (n = 4) minutes. End-systolic triggered imaging with a mechanical index (MI) of 1.5 was used throughout this part of the study. The second study compared bolus injection with a continuous infusion in 9 volunteers, with a single-dose level but different imaging modalities: end-systolic and end-diastolic triggered imaging at MIs of both 1.1 and 1.5. Spontaneous baseline PVCs were uncommon: 10 in 344 minutes (0.03 PVC/min, maximal 1 PVC/min) of baseline imaging. During end-diastolic triggering, no increase in PVCs was seen, irrespective of MI. A significant increase to 1.06 PVC/min (P &lt;.001) was seen during end-systolic imaging with an MI of 1.5, but not with an MI of 1.1. The increase in PVC rate was dose-dependent in the initial study. CONCLUSION: Imaging of contrast agents with high acoustic pressures can cause PVCs if end-systolic triggering is used. This effect is related to both the dose of contrast agent and acoustic pressure. It does not occur during end-diastolic triggered imaging. Precautionary measures would include using lower MIs or end-diastolic triggering.",M1

10646951,"Relation between spatial distribution of late potentials and location of origin of premature ventricular complexes on body surface map in patients with postinfarction ventricular tachycardia.We studied the relationship between the spatial distribution of late potentials (LPs) and the origin of premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) using body surface maps in 55 patients with postinfarction sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Body surface maps were recorded from 87 leads to construct departure maps during sinus rhythm and signal-averaged ECGs were recorded from 32 unipolar leads to construct a LP map. The root-mean-square values during 40 ms intervals behind the QRS end were computed as LPs. The PVC map was recorded simultaneously in 14 patients presenting PVC with similar morphology to VT during LP detection. The origin of PVC was localized at the site of isopotential minimum when the potential exceeded -0.5 mV during the early QRS period. The LP area and the departure area showed a similar distribution. However, the PVC origin was closer to the site of LP maximum than the departure minimum in 11 (79%) patients, and the spatial correlation between the LP maximum and the PVC origin was good in 12 (86%) patients. LP and PVC mapping from the body surface is feasible and of worth to predict noninvasively the site of origin of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with remote myocardial infarction and sustained VT.",M1
10642129,"Localization of precise origin of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia from the right ventricular outflow tract by a 12-lead ECG: a study of pace mapping using a multielectrode  basket  catheter.Radiofrequency catheter ablation guided by pace-mapping techniques has proven effective in eliminating idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A method for rapidly identifying the origin of VT from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings would be helpful for the catheter ablation procedure. The purpose of this study is to precisely localize the origin of idiopathic VT from the RVOT by a 12-lead ECG from a study of multipoint pace mapping. In one patient with premature ventricular complex (<e>PVC</e>) and 3 with VT, a  basket  catheter was deployed in the RVOT for bipolar pacing from 56 sites in the endocardium of RVOT. Under fluoroscopy the pacing sites were classified into the septum and free wall. We investigated the QRS morphology in leads, I, II, and III; the depth of the QS wave in leads aVR and aVL; and the height of the initial r wave in leads V1 and V2. Pacing was captured in 30-47 of 56 sites (54%-84%). As the pacing sites changed from the anterior to posterior of the septum, the QS notch (-) type in lead I shifted through rs to R, while a shift from R type to rR' or Rr' was noted in leads II and III. As the pacing sites changed from the anterior to posterior of the free wall, lead I showed a shift from the QS notch (+) type to R, while a shift from rR' to Rr' (or rR' unchanged) was found in leads II and III. The depth of the QS wave in leads aVR and aVL showed a tendency for aVR to be deeper than aVL toward the posterolateral attachment of both the septum and free wall, whereas aVL tended to be deeper than aVR toward the anterior attachment. The initial r waves in V1 and V2 became greater as the pacing site was positioned at a higher or more posterior location. These findings may provide more precise and clinically useful diagnostic information on the site of the origin of idiopathic VT originating from the RVOT by a 12-lead ECG.",M1
10102730,"Premature ventricular contractions during +Gz with and without pressure breathing and extended coverage anti-G suit.BACKGROUND: High +Gz is known to provoke cardiac dysrhythmias. Pressure breathing during G (PBG) and extended coverage anti-G suits (ECGS) are used to enhance +Gz-endurance and reduce fatigue during high +Gz flying. It is not known whether PBG in combination with ECGS increases the risk for premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>). HYPOTHESIS: PBG in combination with ECGS increases the risk of PVCs during high +Gz-loads. METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from 14 subjects exposed to three different simulated aerial combat sorties each, in the centrifuge with a standard anti-G suit ensemble or with PBG in combination with ECGS. Each sortie consisted of a gradual onset G-exposure (GOR) and three simulated aerial combat maneuvers (SACM) containing four cycles of a +4.5 to +7 GzSACM; four cycles of +4 to +9 Gz tactical aerial combat maneuver (TACM) with several rapid transitions from +4 or +5 Gz to +8 or +9 Gz; and four cycles of +5 to +9 Gz SACM (5-9 SACM) with four cycles. ECG was recorded during the +Gz exposures to reveal any cardiac dysrhythmias. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No PVCs occurred during the GORs. During 4.5-7 SACMs, TACMs, and 5-9 SACMs there were 83, 50, and 24 PVCs with standard equipment, respectively, and 63, 54, and 39 PVCs with PBG and ECGS, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the equipment in any of the different types of +Gz exposures. No episodes of supraventricular tachycardia or relative bradycardia were found with either equipment.",M1
10087549,"QT dispersion in children with ventricular arrhythmia and a structurally normal heart.In adults, increased QT dispersion has been shown to predict arrhythmic risk as well as risk of sudden death in several clinical settings. It is not known whether or not QT dispersion is increased in children with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia. We studied three groups of children: (1) 20 patients with idiopathic VT (aged 3-18 years; mean 11.2 years); (2) 30 patients with benign <e>PVCs</e> (aged 1-20 years; mean 10.5 years); and (3) 30 control subjects (aged 4-17 years; mean 12 years). Standard ECGs were reviewed and the dispersion of both QT and JT intervals was compared. No patient had structural heart disease or long QT syndrome. The QT and QTc dispersion (QT delta, QTc delta) among the three groups did not differ: QTc delta of the VT group was 70 ms +/- 30 ms, QTc delta of PVC patients was 60 ms +/- 30 ms, and the QTc delta of the control group was 65 ms +/- 30 ms. The JTc delta among the three groups did not differ as well: JTc delta of the VT group was 70 ms +/- 30 ms, the JTc delta of the PVC group was 60 msec +/- 25 msec, and the JTc delta of the control group was 70 ms +/- 30 ms. We conclude that QT and JT dispersion are not significantly altered in children with idiopathic VT or benign PVCs when compared to control subjects. QT dispersion is not a reliable marker for arrhythmic risk in children with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias and structurally normal hearts.",M1
9529838,"Radiofrequency catheter ablation for frequent premature ventricular contractions: a preliminary report of 15 cases.Between February 1995 and March 1997, 15 patients, 13 women and 2 men, underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for symptomatic frequent premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVC</e>'s). The mean age was 43.3 +/- 11.9 years. Thirteen patients (86.7%) had right PVC's and the remainder had both right and left PVC's. RFCA were done under local anesthesia, using both earliest endocardial activation time and pace mapping in complement. The immediate success rate was 14/15 (93%) with only minor complications in 2 patients (13.3%). The fluoroscopic and procedure times were 40.6 +/- 24.0 and 170.7 +/- 81.2 minutes, respectively. From the Holter monitoring, total PVC count, per cent of PVC per total heart beat in 24 hours and couplets count were significantly reduced, (more than 90%, p &lt; 0.05), by RFCA. Triplets and repetitive ventricular tachycardia were totally abolished. During the follow-up period of 10.1 +/- 7.5 months, 2 patients (14.3%) had recurrences of right PVC's within 2 weeks after ablation. Reablation was successfully done in both patients without recurrence, giving the final success rate of 93 per cent. In conclusion, RFCA could be safely performed with a high success rate in patients with symptomatic frequent PVC's. It can be considered an alternative treatment in patients resistant to medical therapy.",M1
9363814,"Mode of onset of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.INTRODUCTION: The mode of onset of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF]) has been well described in patients with organic heart disease and in patients with the long QT syndromes. Less is known about the mode of onset of VF in patients with out-of-hospital VF who have no evidence of organic heart disease or identifiable etiology. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the ECGs of all our patients with idiopathic VF. Documentation of the onset of spontaneous arrhythmias was available for 22 VF episodes in 9 patients (6 men and 3 women; age 41 +/- 16 years). In all instances, spontaneous VF followed a rapid polymorphic VT, which was initiated by premature ventricular complexes (<e>PVCs</e>) with very short coupling intervals. The PVC initiating VF had a coupling interval of 302 +/- 52 msec and a prematurity index of 0.4 +/- 0.07. These PVCs occurred within 40 msec of the peak of the preceding T wave. Pause-dependent arrhythmias were never observed. CONCLUSION: Cardiac arrest among patients with idiopathic VF has a very distinctive mode of onset. Documentation of a polymorphic VT that is not pause dependent is of diagnostic value.",M1
9647622,"[A technique of <e>PVC</e> detection in QRS wave]A technique of PVC detection is described in this paper. The procedures of PVC analysis include noise detection, QRS detection, feature extraction and QRS wave classification. The interference is detected in hierarchy ways. A new non-linear transformation of ECG waveform is given to be taken as the QRS detection function. Taking this QRS detection function, the influence of noise and interference can be reduced greatly. By the technique of QRS template matching, QRS waveforms are sorted into different clusters in QRS wave form space. Then a linear classifier is used to identify the medical meaning of these clustes. Before the linear classifier is applied, the QRS waveforms are classified according to some special decision rules. 38 half-hour standard database is used to test the technique presented in this paper. The result shows t hat accuracy rate of PVC detection is better than 95%.",M1
8962561,"Postextrasystolic U wave augmentation, a new marker of increased arrhythmic risk in patients without the long QT syndrome.OBJECTIVES: We attempted to determine the correlation between the presence of postextrasystolic changes in the STU segment and a history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. BACKGROUND: Postextrasystolic U wave augmentation (a marked increment in U wave amplitude after premature ventricular complexes [<e>PVCs</e>]) is an adverse prognostic sign in the  pause-dependent long QT syndrome.  However, the prevalence of postextrasystolic changes in patients without the long QT syndrome is unknown. METHODS: We compared the configuration of the STU segment of the postextrasystolic beat (the sinus beat after a PVC) with the STU configuration during sinus rhythm in three patient groups: 1) 41 patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) (VT/VF group), 2) 63 patients with heart disease and high grade ventricular arrhythmias (control group), and 3) 29 patients with high grade ventricular arrhythmias but no heart disease (reference group). RESULTS: Postextrasystolic T wave changes did not correlate with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, postextrasystolic U wave changes were more common among the patients with VT/VF than among control subjects (39% vs. 8.7%, p &lt; 0.001). By logistic multiple regression analysis, a low left ventricular ejection fraction (p &lt; 0.001) and postextrasystolic U wave changes (p &lt; 0.005) were independent predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Postextrasystolic T wave changes are common and lack predictive value. Postextrasystolic U wave changes may be a specific marker of a tendency to the development of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm this association.",M1
8832443,"Incidence and risk factors of guidewire-induced arrhythmia during internal jugular venous catheterization: comparison of marked and plain J-wires.STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence and risk factors of guidewire-induced arrhythmia (GIA) during internal jugular venous catheterization (IJV). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Operating rooms at a medical center. PATIENTS: 303 ASA physical status I, II, III, and IV patients undergoing elective surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were cannulated with the central venous catheters placed via the right internal jugular vein after induction of anesthesia. They were randomly divided into two groups. In one group, we used a marked J-wire and inverted up to, but not beyond 20 cm (Group M, n = 127). In the other group, a plain unmarked J-wire was used and inserted at will (Group UM, n = 176). All IJV catheterizations were performed by residents, and the length of J-wire inserted was then measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Types of arrhythmia [eg, premature atrial contraction (PAC) or premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>)] were interpreted by attending anesthesiologists on lead II ECG. Patients in Group UM had a significantly greater incidence of GIA than those in Group M (28.4% vs. 3.9%; p &lt; .005). However, in both groups, PAC occurred more frequently than PVC. Factors such as the inserted length of guidewire longer than 20 cm, body height less than 170 cm, and female gender were significantly associated with GIA (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the length of the guidewire insertion to less than or equal to 20 cm for right IJV catheterization by using a marked J-wire will reduce the incidence of GIA. We recommend the use of a marked J-wire for IJV catheterization.",M1
8626192,"Classification of cardiac arrhythmias using fuzzy ARTMAP.We have investigated the QRS complex, extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) data, using fuzzy adaptive resonance theory mapping (ARTMAP) to classify cardiac arrhythmias. Two different conditions have been analyzed: normal and abnormal premature ventricular contraction (<e>PVC</e>). Based on MIT/BIH database annotations, cardiac beats for normal and abnormal QRS complexes were extracted from this database, scaled, and Hamming windowed, after bandpass filtering, to yield a sequence of 100 samples for each ORS segment. From each of these sequences, two linear predictive coding (LPC) coefficients were generated using Burg's maximum entropy method. The two LPC coefficients, along with the mean-square value of the QRS complex segment, were utilized as features for each condition to train and test a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network for classification of normal and abnormal PVC conditions. The test results show that the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network can classify cardiac arrhythmias with greater than 99% specificity and 97% sensitivity.",M1
8604630,"Holter-guided identification of premature ventricular contractions susceptible to suppression by beta-blockers.To evaluate whether the identification of the different types of relations between premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) and the preceding sinus cycle length is capable of predicting the effect of beta-blockers on the PVCs themselves, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women, mean age 52.6 +/- 15.6 years) with different cardiac diseases, and &gt;30 PVCs/hr characterized by stability and the same relation at two Holter monitoring periods were studied. The relation was tachycardia enhanced (the shorter the preceding cycle length, the higher the incidence of PVCs) in 23 patients (group 1); indifferent (no correlation between the preceding cycle length and PVC incidence) in 21 (group 2); and bradycardia enhanced (the longer the preceding cycle length, the higher the incidence of PVCs) in 11 (group 3). A third Holter monitoring was performed 6 days after nadolol administration (80 mg/day) to evaluate its effect on the three types of PVCs. Incidence in all patients (-88;p&lt;0.001). In group 2, it caused a reduction in the majority of patients (-60%;p&lt;0.05) but an increase in five. In group 3, it caused a reduction in only half of the patients (-45%) and a 91% increase in the remainder. The difference in the effect of nadolol in the three groups was highly significant (X2=27.5;p&lt;0.0001). The relation between the incidence of PVCs and the preceding cycle length is a useful means of identifying subsets of patients with PVCs who will benefit from beta-blockers.",M1
8546345,"Cerebrovascular hemodynamic inefficiency of premature ventricular contractions.Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements of middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities were recorded and synchronized with electrocardiographic (EKG) recordings in 52 EKG/TCD complexes in 4 patients. Thirty-seven normal sinus beats and 13 conductive and 2 nonconductive premature ventricular contractions (<e>PVCs</e>) were examined. Mean velocities averaged 45 +/- 4 cm/sec for normal sinus rhythm (NSR) vs 26 +/- 4 cm/sec in the PVC group (P = 0.007). Peak systolic velocities averaged 74 +/- 6 cm/sec for the NSR and 45 +/- 7 cm/sec in the PVC group (P = 0.016). The latency between the QRS complexes and corresponding TCD wave forms (QRS-SU) averaged 0.12 +/- 0.03 sec in NSR AND 0.17 +/- 0.04 sec for the PVC group (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, QRS-SU was inversely related to all velocities. PVCs appeared to be less hemodynamically efficient than NSR. The lower blood flow velocities and increased QRS-SU may result from lower stroke volume and delayed ventricular contraction associated with the aberrant QRS complex.",M1
20335959,"Polysaccharides coatings on medical-grade <e>PVC</e>: a probe into surface characteristics and the extent of bacterial adhesion.Medical-grade polyvinyl chloride was coated by polysaccharides through a novel physicochemical approach. An initial surface activation was performed foremost via diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge plasma in air at ambient temperature and pressure. Then, radical graft copolymerization of acrylic acid through grafting-from pathway was directed to render a well-defined brush of high density, and finally a chitosan monolayer and chitosan/pectin alternating multilayer were bound onto the functionalized surfaces. Surface characteristics were systematically investigated using several probe techniques. In vitro bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation assays indicated that a single chitosan layer was incapable of hindering the adhesion of a Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strain, while up to 30% reduction was achieved by the chitosan/pectin layered assembly. On the other hand, chitosan and chitosan/pectin multilayer could retard Escherichia coli adhesion by 50% and 20%, respectively. Furthermore, plasma treated and graft copolymerized samples were also found effective to diminish the degree of adherence of Escherichia coli.",M2

20223066,"Influence of polymer packaging films on hyperspectral imaging data in the visible-near-infrared (450-950 nm) wavelength range.Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has recently emerged as a useful tool for quality analysis of consumer goods (e.g., food and pharmaceutical products). These products are typically packaged in polymeric film prior to distribution; however, HSI experiments are typically carried out on such samples ex-packaging (either prior to or after removal from packaging). This research examines the effects of polymer packaging films (polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) on spectral and spatial features of HSI data in order to investigate the potential of HSI for quality evaluation of packaged goods. The effects of packaging film were studied for hyperspectral images of samples obtained in the visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR, i.e., 450-950 nm) wavelength range, which is relevant to many food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical products. The dominant influence of the films tested in this wavelength range could be attributed to light scattering. Relative position of the light source, film, and detector were shown to be highly influential on the scattering effects observed. Detection of features on samples imaged through film was shown to be possible after some data preprocessing. This suggests that quality analysis of products packaged in polymer film is feasible using HSI. These findings would be useful in the development of quality monitoring tools for consumer products post-packaging using HSI.",M2
20188975,"Ionic liquid-polyvinyl chloride ionomer for highly selective isolation of basic proteins.Hydrophilic ionic liquid-polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) hybrids were prepared by immobilizing N-methylimidazole (N-mim) to PVC chains in toluene. The NmimCl-PVC hybrids were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, surface charge analysis and elemental analysis. The immobilization ratio, i.e., the percentage of chloride on PVC chain reacting with N-mim to form the hybrid, varies from 4.3% to 15.1% by increasing the N-mim/PVC molar ratio. The most distinct feature of the hybrid is its excellent selectivity for adsorbing basic proteins by effective suppression of the non-specific protein adsorption by pure PVC, and a higher immobilization ratio facilitates better selectivity. In Tris-HCl buffer, 100 microg mL(-1) of basic proteins, i.e., lysozyme (Lys), cytochrome c (cyt-c) and hemoglobin (Hb), were favorably adsorbed with efficiencies of 97%, 98% and 94% by the hybrid with an immobilization ratio of 15.1%, while the adsorption of acidic proteins, i.e., bovine albumin serum (BSA), transferring (Trf) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were negligible. The retained Lys, cyt-c and Hb could be readily recovered by elution with phosphate buffer, carbonate buffer and SDS solution with efficiencies of 89%, 87% and 84%, respectively. Another feature of the hybrid is the significant improvement of the biocompatibility characterized by the maintenance of the activity of hemoglobin after adsorption and elution process.

20171781,"Chlorine characterization and thermal behavior in MSW and RDF.Chlorine, as a key element causing high temperature corrosion and low efficiency in waste-to-energy plants, and its thermal behavior has widely drawn attention. In this study, the chlorine content in eight fractions of municipal solid waste (MSW) was quantified and characterized using five analytical methods. The influence of the operating temperature, and fuel additives like sulfur and silica on the volatilization of chlorine in combustion process was also investigated. The results showed: these fractions cover a wide range of chlorine content from 0.1 wt.% in wood to &gt;6 wt.% in non-packaging plastics (dry basis). Polyvinylchloride (<e>PVC</e>) from packaging, electrical wire insulation etc. in plastics and chloride salts (mainly NaCl) in kitchen waste are the main sources of organic and inorganic chlorine. The increase of the operating temperature from 700 degrees C to 1000 degrees C has more influence on the HCl formation for kitchen waste than that for PVC. Sulfur addition leads to 20-40% higher HCl formation rate in most fractions. Silica supports the chlorine release at relatively low temperatures between 700 degrees C and 850 degrees C. These findings enhance to understand the thermal behavior of chlorine in MSW and RDF (refuse derived fuel) in waste-to-energy plants and lead to the suggestions for a fuel management for waste derived fuels in order to avoid chlorine induced corrosion.",M2

One of the sensors was fabricated by using PVC-COOH only as anionic site without incorporation of an ionophore (sensor 1). The second sensor was constructed by using 2-hydroxy propyl beta-cyclodextrin as an ionophore (sensor 2). Linear responses of PB within a concentration range of 10(-3)-10(-2) and 10(-5)-10(-2) M, with slopes of 51.9 +/- 0.31 and 56.7 +/- 0.40 mV/decade over pH range of 5-10 were obtained using sensors 2 and 1, respectively. The proposed method displayed useful analytical characteristics for determination of PB in tablets with average recoveries of 100.22 +/- 0.62, and 100.15 +/- 0.72, and in plasma with average recoveries of 99.14 +/- 1.19 and 99.79 +/- 0.72, for sensors 2 and 1, respectively. The utility of 2-hydroxy propyl beta-cyclodextrin as an ionophore has a significant influence on increasing both membrane sensitivity and selectivity of sensor 2 in comparison with sensor 1. The methods were also used to determine the intact drug in the presence of its degradate, and thus could be used as stability-indicating methods.

20159936,"Simple surface sulfonation retards plasticiser migration and impacts upon blood/material contact activation processes.BACKGROUND: The use of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) plasticised polyvinyl chloride (DEHPPPVC) in medical devices persists despite evidence suggesting that DEHP migration can be harmful. Researchers have shown that a simple surface sulfonation process can retard the migration of DEHP, which may reduce the associated inflammatory response. The present study is designed to investigate the effects of surface sulfonation on DEHP migration and blood contact activation using in vitro and rodent models. METHODS: The study was carried out in two phases: phase 1, in which the migration rate of DEHP from DEHPPPVC and sulfonated DEHP plasticised <e>PVC</e> (SDEHPPPVC) was measured; phase 2 of the study, in which the materials were incorporated into a rat recirculation biomaterial test model and blood samples taken to assess CD11b expression on neutrophils, IL-6 and Factor XIIa. RESULTS: The initial DEHP concentration washed from the surface after storage was 37.19 +/- 1.17 mg/l in the PPVC group and 5.89 +/- 0.81 mg/l in the SPPVC group (p&lt;0.0001). The post-wash migration rate was 3.07 +/- 0.32 mg/l/hour in the PPVC group compared to 0.46 +/- 0.038 mg/l/hour in the SPPVC group (p&lt;0.0001). In phase 2 of the study, CD11b expression increased by 228.9% +/- 37% over the test period in the PPVC group compared to 118.3% +/- 46% in the SPPVC group (p&lt;0.01). IL-6 levels rose from 3.1 +/- 1.4 pg/ml to 263 +/- 26 pg/ml in the PPVC group and 2.2 +/- 1.6 pg/ml to 161 +/- 29 pg/ml in the SPPVC group (p&lt;0.01). Factor XIIa levels rose from 0.22 +/- 0.13 g/ml to 3.7 +/- 0.32 microg/ml and 0.28 +/- 0.09 to 2.71 +/- 0.21 microg/ml in the PPVC and SPPVC groups, respectively (p&lt;0.05 at 90 minutes).

The solid-phase photocatalytic degradation behavior of PVC-VC-TiO(2) nano-composite film under UV light irradiation was investigated and compared with those of the PVC-TiO(2) film and the pure PVC film, with the aid of UV-Vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), weight loss monitoring, and X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD). The results show that PVC-VC-TiO(2) nano-composite film has a high photocatalytic activity; the photocatalytic degradation rate of it is two times higher than that of PVC-TiO(2) film and fifteen times higher than that of pure PVC film. The optimal mass ratio of VC to TiO(2) is found to be 0.5. The mechanism of enhancing photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of a Ti(IV)-VC charge-transfer complex with five-member chelate ring structure and a rapid photogenerated charge separation is thus achieved.",M2

METHODS: Sixty milliliters of cetuximab was drawn directly from a commercially available vial, and 20 mL was injected into each of three sterile, empty, 100-mL PVC bags through a preattached 0.22-microm filter. Three milliliters of panitumumab and 21 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection were mixed, and 8 mL of the mixture was injected into each of three empty PVC bags through a preattached 0.22-microm filter. Samples were analyzed immediately after preparation and again after storage at 4 degrees C for 7 and 14 days. Cetuximab and panitumumab concentrations were measured using a modification of a previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Stability was defined as the mean concentrations of the test solutions being within assay variability of the initial concentration. Solution appearance and color were assessed by observing the samples against black and white backgrounds. RESULTS: The percentages of initial concentration of cetuximab and panitumumab were over 90% stored at 4 degrees C after 14 days. No changes in color or turbidity were observed in any of the vials and the prepared solutions. CONCLUSION: Cetuximab 2 mg/mL was stable when stored for 14 days in a glass vial and in PVC bags at 4 degrees C. Panitumumab 20 mg/mL in a glass vial and 2.5 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in PVC bags was also stable when stored for 14 days at 4 degrees C.",M2
20092073,"The effect of priming solutions and storage time on plasticizer migration in different <e>PVC</e> tubing types--implications for wet storage of ECMO systems.The wet priming of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems and storage of these systems for rapid deployment is common practice in many clinical centers. This storage policy is, however, seen by many to be controversial due to the potential adverse effects associated with the migration of the di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate plasticizer (DEHP) from the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) circuit tubing and issues surrounding the maintenance of sterility. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of both short and long-term storage and priming fluid type on plasticizer migration from four commonly used PVC tubes in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy circuits. The four tubes incorporating three plasticizers, two DEHP, one tri(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TOTM), and one dioctyl adipate (DOA) were exposed to each of the three priming fluids for a period of 28 days. Samples were taken at time intervals of 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours, followed by samples at 7, 14, and 28 days. Each sample was processed using a spectrophotomer and the concentration of plasticizer leaching into each solution at each time-point determined. There was a time dependent increase in plasticizer leached from each tube. The migration was greatly affected by both the priming fluid and tubing type. The migration of DEHP was higher than that of TOTM and DOA over both the short and long-term exposure levels. Plasticizer migration occurs from all of the tubes tested over the long term. The TOTM and DOA tubes performed better than the DEHP counterparts in the short term. Selection of priming fluid has a major bearing on plasticizer migration with significant lipid and protein containing fluids promoting higher migration than simple sodium chloride .9% solution prime. The results suggest that DOA tubing and sodium chloride. 9% solution priming fluid should be selected if wet primed perfusion circuits are to be used over short terms of storage.",M2
20083084,"Poly(vinyl chloride) tubing with covalently bound alkaline phosphatase and alternative approach for investigations of open-tubular bioreactors.A one-step carbodiimide method was found to allow covalent binding of enzymes to the inner wall of poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>) tubing. The immobilization is performed under mild conditions without laborious pretreatment or activation of reactor surface. In these preliminary studies, alkaline phosphatase (ALP, EC 3.1.3.1) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) were applied as a model enzyme and substrate, respectively. The resulting open-tubular bioreactor exhibits satisfactory operational and storage stability. In addition, a novel and very simple instrumental concept for optical monitoring of the biocatalytic process directly inside the microbioreactor using a system of paired emitter-detector diodes is presented.",M2
20082033,"Evaluation of surface sampling techniques for collection of Bacillus spores on common drinking water pipe materials.Drinking water utilities may face biological contamination of the distribution system from a natural incident or deliberate contamination. Determining the extent of contamination or the efficacy of decontamination is a challenge, because it may require sampling of the wetted surfaces of distribution infrastructure. This study evaluated two sampling techniques that utilities might use to sample exhumed pipe sections. Polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>), cement-lined ductile iron, and ductile iron pipe coupons (3 cm x 14 cm) cut from new water main piping were conditioned for three months in dechlorinated Cincinnati, Ohio tap water. Coupons were spiked with Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii, a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. Brushing and scraping were used to recover the inoculated spores from the coupons. Mean recoveries for all materials ranged from 37 +/- 30% to 43 +/- 20% for brushing vs. 24 +/- 10% to 51 +/- 29% for scraping. On cement-lined pipe, brushing yielded a significantly different recovery than scraping. No differences were seen between brushing and scraping the PVC and iron pipe coupons. Mean brushing and scraping recoveries from PVC coupons were more variable than mean recoveries from cement-lined and iron coupons. Spore retention differed between pipe materials and the presence of established biofilms also had an impact. Conditioned PVC coupons (with established biofilms) had significantly lower spore retention (31 +/- 11%) than conditioned cement-lined coupons (61 +/- 14%) and conditioned iron coupons (71 +/- 8%).",M2
20065586,"Sibutramine selective electrodes for batch and flow injection determinations in pharmaceutical preparations.The construction and electrochemical response characteristics of two new polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) membrane sensors for the determination of sibutramine hydrochloride were described. The sensors are based on the ion association complexes of sibutramine with sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) or phosphotungstic acid (PTA) using dibutyl phthalate as plasticizing solvent. The sensors display a fast, stable response over the concentration range 3.84 x 10(-5)-1.00 x 10(-2) M sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate (SibuCl), with cationic slopes of 57.7 +/- 0.57 and 59.7 +/- 1.79 mV concentration decade(-1) and detection limits of 8.91 x 10(-6) and 1.47 x 10(-5) M in case of sibutramine-tetraphenylborate (Sibu-TPB) and sibutramine-phosphotungstate ((Sibu)(3)-PT), respectively.

20064712,"Creep behavior of bagasse fiber reinforced polymer composites.The creep behavior of bagasse-based composites with virgin and recycled polyvinyl chloride (B/<e>PVC</e>) and high density polyethylene (B/HDPE) as well as a commercial wood and HDPE composite decking material was investigated. The instantaneous deformation and creep rate of all composites at the same loading level increased at higher temperatures. At a constant load level, B/PVC composites had better creep resistance than B/HDPE systems at low temperatures. However, B/PVC composites showed greater temperature-dependence. Several creep models (i.e., Burgers model, Findley's power law model, and a simpler two-parameter power law model) were used to fit the measured creep data. Time-temperature superposition (TTS) was attempted for long-term creep prediction. The four-element Burgers model and the two-parameter power law model fitted creep curves of the composites well. The TTS principle more accurately predicted the creep response of the PVC composites compared to the HDPE composites.",M2

The best performance was observed for the membrane composition including 33.0% PVC, 65.0% TEHP, 1.0% NaTPB and 1.0% ionophore. The electrode displayed a linear potential response over a wide concentration range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-1)mol L(-1), with a detection limit of 5.0 x 10(-8)mol L(-1) and a good Nernstian slope of 19.9+/-0.3 mV decade(-1). The sensor possessed some advantages such as short conditioning time, very fast response time (&lt;12s) and especially good discriminating ability towards Fe(III) ions over a wide variety of alkali, alkaline earth, transition, and heavy metal ions. The potential response of the proposed sensor was independent of the pH of the test solution, in the pH working range from 3.0 to 6.3. The fabricated electrode was applied for at least 2 months, without any measurable divergence in the potential characteristics. The optimized sensor was used successfully for direct and indirect determination of free iron species in some different synthetic and real samples with satisfactory results.",M2
20042236,"The attenuation of platelet and monocyte activation in a rabbit model of extracorporeal circulation by a nitric oxide releasing polymer.Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to reduce thrombogenicity by decreasing platelet and monocyte activation by the surface glycoprotein, P-selectin and the integrin, CD11b, respectively. In order to prevent platelet and monocyte activation with exposure to an extracorporeal circulation (ECC), a nitric oxide releasing (NORel) polymeric coating composed of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) blended with a lipophilic N-diazeniumdiolate was evaluated in a 4 h rabbit thrombogenicity model using flow cytometry. The NORel polymer significantly reduced ECC thrombus formation compared to polymer control after 4 h blood exposure (2.8 +/- 0.7 NORel vs 6.7 +/- 0.4 pixels/cm(2) control). Platelet count (3.4 +/- 0.3 NORel vs 2.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(8)/ml control) and function as measured by aggregometry (71 +/- 3 NORel vs 17 +/- 6% control) were preserved after 4 h exposure in NORel versus control ECC. Plasma fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in both NORel and control groups. Platelet P-selectin mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as measured by flow cytometry was attenuated after 4 h on ECC to ex vivo collagen stimulation (27 +/- 1 NORel vs 40 +/- 2 MFI control). Monocyte CD11b expression was reduced after 4 h on ECC with NORel polymer (87 +/- 14 NORel vs 162 +/- 30 MFI control). These results suggest that the NORel polymer coatings attenuate the increase in both platelet P-selectin and monocytic CD11b integrin expression in blood exposure to ECCs. These NO-mediated platelet and monocytic changes were shown to improve thromboresistance of these NORel-polymer-coated ECCs for biomedical devices.",M2
20035395,"Impact of non-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate cardiopulmonary bypass tubes on inflammatory cytokines and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems during cardiopulmonary bypass.Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), an excellent plasticizer for poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>), is a known endocrine-disrupting chemical. This study was designed to investigate whether a new non-DEHP bilayer tube reduced the release of DEHP, suppressed inflammatory cytokines, and altered coagulation-fibrinolysis systems. Sixteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomly assigned to the non-DEHP bilayer group (group B, n = 8), or the noncoated PVC group (group N, n = 8). The level of DEHP in the blood was measured before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were also measured at six points during and after CPB. DEHP was significantly lower in group B (472 +/- 141 ng/ml) after CPB compared with group N (2094 +/- 1046 ng/ml). The IL-6 level was significantly lower in group B (151 +/- 131 pg/ml) than group N (206 +/- 224 pg/ml) 180 min after protamine administration. The D-dimer level was significantly lower in group B 60 min after protamine administration (6.2 +/- 2.4 microg/ml in group B vs 10.4 +/- 4.5 microg/ml in group N) and 180 min after protamine administration (4.4 +/- 0.7 microg/ml in group B vs 7.3 +/- 2.7 microg/ml in group N). Group B had a tendency toward reduced postoperative bleeding compared with group N at any time. The bilayer tube was superior to the noncoated tube in terms of the inhibition of DEHP release, inflammatory cytokines, and the fibrinolysis system.",M2
20031386,"Feasibility study of the separation of chlorinated films from plastic packaging wastes.This study describes the possible separation of chlorinated plastic films (<e>PVC</e> and PVDC) from other heavy plastic packaging waste (PPW) by selective twist formation and gravity separation. Twists formation was mechanically induced in chlorinated plastic films, whereas twist formation did not occur in PS and PET films. After twist formation, all the films had the apparent density of less than 1.0g/cm(3) and floated in water even though the true density was more than 1.0g/cm(3). However, the apparent density of the PS and the PET films increased with agitation to more than 1.0g/cm(3), whereas that of chlorinated plastic films was kept less than 1.0g/cm(3). The main reason would be the air being held inside the chlorinated plastic films which was difficult to be removed by agitation. Simple gravity separation after twist formation was applied for artificial film with 10wt.% of the chlorinated films and real PPW films with 9wt.% of the chlorinated films. About 76wt.% of the artificial PPW films and 75wt.% of real PPW films after the removal of PP and PE were recovered as settling fraction with 4.7wt.% and 3.0wt.% of chlorinated plastic films, respectively. These results indicate that simple gravity separation process after twist formation can be used to reduce the chlorinated plastic concentration from mixed heavy PPW films.",M2
20009330,"Carbon paste- and <e>PVC</e> membrane electrodes as sensitive sensors for the determination of antidiabetic drugs for type 2 diabetic patients.Carbon paste- and polyvinyl chloride membrane electrodes are simple, precise, rapid and selective sensors for the determination of antidiabetic drugs for type 2 diabetic patients. These electrodes were successfully used for the potentiometric determination of rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, glimepiride and glyburide in their standard forms and also as pharmaceutical preparations. The preparation of these ion-selective electrodes for the potentiometric determination of the drug is based on the construction of a 10% standard drug-ion pair with reineckate or tungstophosphate imbedded as an electro-active material in the carbon paste or in the polyvinyl chloride membrane. The prepared ion-selective electrodes showed a Nernstian response with a limit of detection amounting to 10(-6) M in a pH range of 3 to 5. A good selectivity coefficient and long term stability could be achieved. The developed potentiometric method based on the CPE and PVC sensors is economic and less time consuming compared to the conventionally used high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC, methods.",M2
20000696,"Effects of architecture and surface chemistry of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbon solid contacts on performance of ion-selective electrodes.The effects of the architecture and surface chemistry of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon solid contacts on the properties of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) were examined. Infiltration of the plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>) membrane into the pores of the carbon created a large interfacial area between the sensing membrane and the solid contact, as shown by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and elemental analysis. This large interfacial area, along with the high capacitance of the 3DOM carbon solid contacts (as determined by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) results in an excellent long-term stability of the potentiometric response, with drifts as low as 11.7 muV/h. The comparison of 3DOM carbon solid contacts with an untemplated carbon solid contact shows that the pore structure is an essential feature for the excellent electrode performance. However, the surface chemistry of the 3DOM carbon cannot be ignored. While there is no evidence for an aqueous layer forming between the sensing membrane and unoxidized 3DOM carbon, electrodes based on oxidized 3DOM carbon exhibit potentiometric responses with the typical hysteresis indicative of a water layer. A comparison of the different techniques to characterize the solid contacts confirms that constant-current charge-discharge experiments offer an intriguing approach to assess the long-term stability of solid-contact ISEs but shows that their results need to be interpreted with care.",M2

Different membrane constituents were investigated to realise optimum performance of the ISE developed. Of the four plasticizers and two ion additives studied, the best response was observed with membrane having 2-nitro phenyl octyl ether (oNPOE) as plasticizer and potassium tetrakis (perchloro phenyl) borate (KTpClPB) as ion additive. Linear response over concentration range of 10(-5)-10(-1)M CsCl was obtained. The Nernstian slope of the response was 56 mV per decade for Cs with a response time less than 20s. Matched potential method has been applied to find out the selectivity for Cs over several ions like Rb(+), K(+), Na(+), NH(4)(+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Ce(3+). The response of ISE for Cs(+) was fairly constant over the pH range of 3-11. The lifetime of the electrode is 9 months which is the longest life for any membrane-based Cs-ISE so far developed. The concentration of cesium in two simulated high level active waste streams was determined and results agreed well with those obtained independently employing atomic absorption spectrometry.",M2
19902302,"In situ silicone tube microextraction: a new method for undisturbed sampling of root-exuded thiophenes from marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) in soil.The difficulties of monitoring allelochemical concentrations in soil and their dynamics over time have been a major barrier to testing hypotheses of allelopathic effects. Here, we evaluate three diffusive sampling strategies that employ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sorbents to map the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of root-exuded thiophenes from the African marigold, Tagetes erecta. Solid phase root zone extraction (SPRE) probes constructed by inserting stainless steel wire into PDMS tubing were used to monitor thiophene concentrations at various depths beneath marigolds growing in <e>PVC</e> pipes. PDMS sheets were used to map the distribution of thiophenes beneath marigolds grown in thin glass boxes. Concentrations of the two major marigold thiophenes measured by these two methods were extremely variable in both space and time. Dissection and analysis of roots indicated that distribution of thiophenes in marigold roots also was quite variable. A third approach used 1 m lengths of PDMS microtubing placed in marigold soil for repeated sampling of soil without disturbance of the roots. The two ends of the tubing remained out of the soil so that solvent could be washed through the tubing to collect samples for HPLC analysis. Unlike the other two methods, initial experiments with this approach show more uniformity of response, and suggest that soil concentrations of marigold thiophenes are affected greatly even by minimal disturbance of the soil. Silicone tube microextraction gave a linear response for alpha-terthienyl when maintained in soils spiked with 0-10 ppm of this thiophene. This method, which is experimentally simple and uses inexpensive materials, should be broadly applicable to the measurement of non-polar root exudates, and thus provides a means to test hypotheses about the role of root exudates in plant-plant and other interactions.",M2
19897949,"[Study of relationship between consumption of potassium permanganate and total organic carbon on plastic kitchen utensils, food packages and toys]Consumption of potassium permanganate and total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated as indices of total organic matter migrated into water from plastic kitchen utensils, food packages and toys for children. The samples were soaked in water at 60 or 95 degrees C for 30 min for kitchen utensils and food packages, and at 40 degrees C for 30 min for toys and the eluates were examined, using the two indices. The quantitation limits were both 0.5 microg/mL. Among 97 kitchen utensils and food packages tested, consumption of potassium permanganate and TOC were 0.5-10.9 microg/mL and ND-18.9 microg/mL for polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) tea-pot spouts and nylon kitchen utensils, respectively. Among 32 toys tested, the levels were 0.8-45.5 microg/mL and 0.5-8.9 microg/mL from PVC toys and block toys made by ethylene vinyl acetate resin. The levels for other samples were very low. There were large discrepancies between consumption of potassium permanganate and TOC for some PVC products and nylon kitchen utensils. The cause may be a marked difference of the oxidation decomposition rate by potassium permanganate, depending on the kind of organic matter that migrated from the plastics.",M2
19886947,"Using probabilistic modeling to evaluate human exposure to organotin in drinking water transported by polyvinyl chloride pipe.The leaching of organotin (OT) heat stabilizers from polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) pipes used in residential drinking water systems may affect the quality of drinking water. These OTs, principally mono- and di-substituted species of butyltins and methyltins, are a potential health concern because they belong to a broad class of compounds that may be immune, nervous, and reproductive system toxicants. In this article, we develop probability distributions of U.S. population exposures to mixtures of OTs encountered in drinking water transported by PVC pipes. We employed a family of mathematical models to estimate OT leaching rates from PVC pipe as a function of both surface area and time. We then integrated the distribution of estimated leaching rates into an exposure model that estimated the probability distribution of OT concentrations in tap waters and the resulting potential human OT exposures via tap water consumption. Our study results suggest that human OT exposures through tap water consumption are likely to be considerably lower than the World Health Organization (WHO)  safe  long-term concentration in drinking water (150 microg/L) for dibutyltin (DBT)--the most toxic of the OT considered in this article. The 90th percentile average daily dose (ADD) estimate of 0.034 +/- 2.92 x 10(-4)microg/kg day is approximately 120 times lower than the WHO-based ADD for DBT (4.2 microg/kg day).",M2
19878966,"Formation of polychlorinated compounds in the combustion of <e>PVC</e> with iron nanoparticles.The influence of iron nanoparticles in the fuel-rich combustion of PVC has been studied in this work. Dynamic runs for PVC and the mixture PVC and iron nanoparticles were firstly carried out by TGA-MS in order to study the influence of iron on the compounds evolved in the thermal degradation of PVC. To complete the study both PVC and a mixture of PVC and iron nanoparticles were burnt in a laboratory reactor under two different operating conditions: at 850 degrees C and in two stages, the first one at 375 degrees C and the resulting char cooled and subsequently burnt at 850 degrees C. Carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, PAHs, chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes and PCDD/Fs were analyzed. It was observed that the mixture of PVC with iron nanoparticles at 375 degrees C greatly enhances the formation of light hydrocarbons and polychlorinated compounds, probably indicating that the presence of iron during the thermal decomposition of PVC causes the formation of iron chloride which may have a high catalytic effect.",M2
19850787,"Physicochemical stability of oxaliplatin in 5% dextrose injection stored in polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene infusion bags.PURPOSE: The physicochemical stability of extemporaneous dilutions of oxaliplatin in 5% dextrose injection stored in polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>), polypropylene, and polyethylene infusion bags was studied. METHODS: Oxaliplatin 100 mg/20 mL concentrated solution was diluted in 100 mL of 5% dextrose injection in PVC, polypropylene, and polyethylene infusion bags to produce nominal oxaliplatin concentrations of 0.2 and 1.3 mg/mL. The filled bags were stored for 14 days at 20 degrees C and protected from light, at 20 degrees C under normal fluorescent light, and at 4 degrees C. A 1-mL sample was removed from each bag at time 0 and at 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 336 hours. The samples were visually inspected for color and clarity, and the pH values of the solutions were measured. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assay oxaliplatin concentration. Bacterial contamination was assessed on study day 14 after incubation in trypticase soy solution for three days at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Solutions of oxaliplatin 0.2 and 1.3 mg/mL in 5% dextrose injection were stable in the three container types for at least 14 days at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C without regard to light exposure. No color change was detected during the storage period, and pH values remained stable. No microbial contamination was detected in any samples over the study period. CONCLUSION: Oxaliplatin solutions diluted in 5% dextrose injection to 0.2 and 1.3 mg/mL were stable in PVC and PVC-free infusion bags for at least 14 days at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C without regard to light exposure.",M2

The best performance was observed with the membranes having the composition L(2):PVC:TBP:NaTPB in the ratio of 6:39:53:2 (w/w; mg). The performance of the membrane based on L(2) was compared with polymeric membrane electrode (PME) and coated graphite electrode (CGE). The PME exhibits detection limit of 4.7x10(-8)M with a Nernstian slope of 29.7 mV decade(-1) of activity between pH 2.5 and 8.5 whereas CGE exhibits the detection limit of 6.8x10(-9)M with a Nernstian slope of 29.5 mV decade(-1) of activity between pH 2.0 and 9.0. The response time for PME and CGE was found to be 11 and 8s, respectively. The CGE has been found to work satisfactorily in partially non-aqueous media up to 35% (v/v) content of methanol, ethanol and 25% (v/v) content of acetonitrile and could be used for a period of 4 months.

19796786,"Consecutive chemical cleaning of fouled <e>PVC</e> membrane using NaOH and ethanol during ultrafiltration of river water.Chemical cleaning of fouled hollow-fiber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane with the consecutive use of NaOH and ethanol during ultrafiltration of river water was investigated in the study. Results showed that through the chemical cleaning with 1% NaOH for 30min, a negative cleaning efficiency of -14.6% was observed for the PVC membrane. This might be due to the increase of membrane hydrophobicity, which was reflected by the increase of contact angle from 69.7 degrees to 87.6 degrees . On the other hand, the cleaning efficiency of 85.1% was obtained by the consecutive cleaning with 30min of 1% NaOH and 30min of ethanol. Individual ethanol cleaning could remove 48.5% of the irreversible resistance, indicating that NaOH cleaning also made its contribution (36.6%) to the removal of membrane foulants. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses demonstrated that both NaOH and ethanol were not only able to eliminate the foulants on membrane surface, but also able to remove the in-pore fouling of the PVC membrane. The synergetic effects for removing membrane foulants were observed between the NaOH and ethanol. Furthermore, ethanol could also restore the hydrophilicity of the membrane by decreasing the contact angle from 87.6 degrees to 71.4 degrees . Considering that ethanol is easy to be used and reclaimed, the consecutive chemical cleaning by alkali and ethanol is recommended for PVC membrane in filtration of surface water.",M2
19713589,"Replication of cicada wing's nano-patterns by hot embossing and UV nanoimprinting.The hydrophobicity of the cicada wing originates from its naturally occurring, surface nano-structure. The nano-structure of the cicada wing consists of an array of nano-sized pillars, 100 nm in diameter and 300 nm in height. In this study, the nano-structure of the cicada wing was successfully duplicated by using hot embossing lithography and UV nanoimprint lithography (NIL). The diameter and pitch of replication were the same as those of the original cicada wing and the height was a little smaller than that of the original master. The transmittance of the hot embossed <e>PVC</e> film was increased by 2-6% compared with that of the bare PVC film. The hydrophobicity was measured by water contact angle measurements. The water contact angle of the replica, made of UV cured polymer, was 132 degrees +/- 2 degrees , which was slightly lower than that of the original cicada wing (138 degrees +/- 2 degrees ), but much higher than that of the UV cured polymer surface without any nano-sized pillars (86 degrees ).",M2
19710122,"Poly(vinyl chloride) film filled with microcrystalline cellulose prepared from cotton fabric waste: properties and biodegradability study.Hydrolysis of cotton fabric waste to produce microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was carried out using 2.5 N hydrochloric acid at 100 degrees C for 30 min. Characterization of the structure, morphology, particle size as well as the thermal decomposition of the obtained MCC were studied using X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope and laser light scattering particle size analyzer and thermogravimetric analyzer, respectively. These results indicated that the obtained MCC had a fibrous structure of a 40 microm average particle size and possessed a form of highly native crystalline cellulose I. In addition, its maximum degradation temperature was observed at 350 degrees C. The poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>) films in this work were produced by first blending the produced MCC with PVC resin in amounts of 5-30 parts per hundred of resin. The blends were then made into film using a two-roll mill. The tensile properties of the film were measured using a Universal Testing Machine. The biodegradation tests were carried out in soil and in a moisture-controlled chamber. The biodegradability was estimated by the loss of mass, moisture absorption capacity and electron microscope studies. It was found that the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the blends increased with increasing amounts of MCC. Similarly, moisture absorption and biodegradability of the films were also increased as the amount of MCC increased. The results implied that MCC behaved not only as a reinforcing filler but also as a biodegradability promoter of PVC films.",M2

The columns were used to separate labile copper fractions in model solutions and in real samples with subsequent determination using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Various model solutions containing 20 microg L(-1) of Cu(2+) and 0.0, 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0 mg L(-1) of humic acid, respectively, and buffered to pH 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 were considered. Results showed a decrease in labile copper fraction with increase in humic acid concentration. Application of the procedure to speciation of Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb in various environmental water samples yielded labile fractions in the range of 1.67-55.75% against a total dissolved fraction of 44.08-69.77%. Comparison of the three chelating agents showed that H(2)sales had a weaker metal chelating strength than Chelex-100, but <e>PVC</e>-FSSH had comparable chelating strength to Chelex-100.",M2
19703365,"Reduction of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation on <e>PVC</e> through covalent surface attachment of fluorinated thiols.OBJECTIVES: This study reports the development, characterisation and microbiological testing of surface-modified polyvinylchloride (PVC) films for the purpose of reducing bacterial adherence. METHODS: Irreversible covalent surface modification was achieved via nucleophilic substitution of fluorinated thiol-terminated compounds onto the polymer backbone. Four fluorinated modifiers, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorothiophenol (TFTP), 4-(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol (TFMTP), 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenethiol (BTFMBT) and 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7, 7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10-heptadecafluoro-decane-1-thiol (HDFDT), were investigated. Modification was confirmed using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy; Raman mapping demonstrated that modification was homogenous on the macroscopic scale. The influence of fluorination on surface hydrophobicity was studied by contact angle analysis. The effect on microbial adherence was examined using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. KEY FINDINGS: The resultant changes in contact angle relative to control PVC ranged from -4 degrees to +14 degrees . In all cases, adherence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was significantly reduced relative to control PVC, with adherence levels ranging from 62% and 51% for TFTP-modified PVC to 32% and 7% for TFMTP-modified PVC. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an important method in reducing the incidence of bacterial infection in PVC medical devices without compromising mechanical properties.",M2

The electrode has linear range of 5.6x10(-6)-1.0x10(-2) and 1.0x10(-5)-1.0x10(-2) mol/L, with detection limits 2.37x10(-6)and 4.60x10(-6) mol/L in batch and flow injection analysis (FIA), respectively. The electrodes show a Nernstian slope value (58.40 and 61.50 mV/decade in batch and FIA, respectively), and the response time is very short (&lt;or=10 s). The potential is nearly stable over the pH range 2.0-8.0. Selectivity coefficient values towards different inorganic cations, sugars and amino acids reflect high selectivity of the prepared electrodes. These are used for determination of Ketotifen using potentiometric titration and standard addition methods in pure samples and its pharmaceutical preparations (Zaditen tablets and syrup). The average recovery values are 99.5 and 99.2% with RSD 1.4 and 1.2% for potentiometric titrations and standard addition methods, respectively. The electrode response at different temperatures was also studied.",M2
19682696,"Sulfonated polyvinyl chloride fibers for cation-exchange microextraction.Polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) fiber was derivatized by concentrated sulfuric acid to yield sulfonated PVC (PVC-SO3H). The PVC-SO3H fiber had dual properties as a sorbent, based on cation-exchange and hydrophobicity. In the present study, the novel fiber was used directly as an individual device for extraction purposes in the cation-exchange microextraction of anaesthetics, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV analysis. The results demonstrated that this PVC-SO3H fiber-based microextraction afforded convenient operation and cost-effective application to basic analytes. The limits of detection for four anaesthetics ranged from 1.2 to 6.0 ng/mL. No carryover (because of its disposable usage), and no loss of sorbent phase (which normally occurs in stir-bar sorptive extraction) during extraction were observed.",M2
19680987,"Search for a more adequate test to predict the long-term migration from the <e>PVC</e> gaskets of metal lids into oily foods in glass jars.As shown previously, the conventional testing procedure for simulating long-term migration from the gaskets of metal closures into oily foods does not adequately reflect reality. It appears to be impossible to accelerate migration to the extent that the situation at the end of the shelf life of a product can be anticipated in a few days or weeks. Therefore, we investigated whether long-term migration could be extrapolated from migration rates determined for new lids. Jars were kept in the normal upright position. Since heat treatment may have a strong temporary impact, migration during the initial heating for pasteurization or sterilization and storage at ambient temperature were determined using different lids. Commercial products were recalled from sales points throughout Europe to determine the real migration over extended periods of time and for jars with differing histories. This migration was compared with data from the short-term testing to investigate whether an empirical relationship could be derived. The results show that the short-term test enables the comparison of lids and plasticizers in the initial phase of migration, but that long-term extrapolation presupposes more complex kinetic modeling. The results also demonstrate that the legal relevance of  official  testing methods should be reconsidered to avoid conflict when food contact materials comply with migration limits in the test but not in actual application.",M2
19656675,"A continuous stirred hydrogen-based polyvinyl chloride membrane biofilm reactor for the treatment of nitrate contaminated drinking water.A continuous stirred hydrogen-based polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was investigated to remove nitrate from the drinking water. The reactor was operated over 100 days, and the result showed that the average nitrate denitrification rate of 1.2 g NO(3)(-)-N/m(2) d and the total nitrogen (TN) removal of 95.1% were achieved with the influent nitrate concentration of 50 mg NO(3)(-)-N/L and the hydrogen pressure of 0.05 MPa. Under the same conditions, the average rate of hydrogen utilization by biofilm was 0.031 mg H(2)/cm(2) d, which was sufficient to remove 50 mg NO(3)(-)-N/L from the contaminated water with the effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations below drinking water limit values. The average hydrogen utilization efficiency was achieved as high as 99.5%. Flux analysis demonstrated that, compared to sulfate reduction, nitrate reduction competed more strongly for hydrogen electron, and obtained more electrons in high influent nitrate loading.",M2

The addition of sodium tetraphenyl borate and various plasticizers, viz., o-NPOE, DBP, DBBP, DOP and CN has been found to substantially improve the performance of the sensors. The best performance was obtained with the sensor no. 1 having membrane of Schiff's base (SL-1) with composition (w/w) SL-1 (4.5%): <e>PVC</e> (30.5%): o-NPOE (59.5%): NaTPB (5.5%).

19473764,"Autohydrogenotrophic denitrification of drinking water using a polyvinyl chloride hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor.A hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) using polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) hollow fiber was evaluated in removing nitrate form contaminated drinking water. During a 279-day operation period, the denitrification rate increased gradually with the increase of influent nitrate loading. The denitrification rate reached a maximum value of 414.72 g N/m(3)d (1.50 g N/m(2)d) at an influent NO(3)(-)-N concentration of 10mg/L and a hydraulic residence time of 37.5 min, and the influent nitrate was completely reduced. At the same time, the effluent quality analysis showed the headspace hydrogen content (3.0%) was lower enough to preclude having an explosive air. Under the condition of the influent nitrate surface loading of 1.04 g N/m(2)d, over 90% removal efficiencies of the total nitrogen and nitrate were achieved at the hydrogen pressure above 0.04 MPa. The results of denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the microbial community structures in MBfR were of low diversity, simple and stable at mature stages; and the beta-Proteobacteria, including Rhodocyclus, Hydrogenophaga, and beta-Proteobacteria HTCC379, probably play an important role in autohydrogenotrophic denitrification.",M2
19437284,"Comparison of endotoxin and particle bounce in Marple cascade samplers with and without impaction grease.The health of persons engaged in agricultural activities are often related or associated with environmental exposures in their workplace. Accurately measuring, analyzing, and reporting these exposures is paramount to outcomes interpretation. This paper describes issues related to sampling air in poultry barns with a cascade impactor. Specifically, the authors describe how particle bounce can affect measurement outcomes and how the use of impaction grease can impact particle bounce and laboratory analyses such as endotoxin measurements. This project was designed to (1) study the effect of particle bounce in Marple cascade impactors that use polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) filters; (2) to determine the effect of impaction grease on endotoxin assays when sampling poultry barn dust. A pilot study was undertaken utilizing six-stage Marple cascade impactors with PVC filters. Distortion of particulate size distributions and the effects of impaction grease on endotoxin analysis in samples of poultry dust distributed into a wind tunnel were studied. Although there was no significant difference in the overall dust concentration between utilizing impaction grease and not, there was a greater than 50% decrease in the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) values when impaction grease was not utilized. There was no difference in airborne endotoxin concentration or endotoxin MMAD between filters treated with impaction grease and those not treated. The results indicate that particle bounce should be a consideration when sampling poultry barn dust with Marple samplers containing PVC filters with no impaction grease. Careful consideration should be given to the utilization of impaction grease on PVC filters, which will undergo endotoxin analysis, as there is potential for interference, particularly if high or low levels of endotoxin are anticipated.",M2
19416005,"The influence of <e>PVC</e> wrapping on the performance of two laser fluorescence devices on occlusal surfaces in vitro.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wrapping on the performance of two laser fluorescence devices (LF and LFpen) by assessing tooth occlusal surfaces. BACKGROUND DATA: Protection of their tips may influence LF measurements. To date there are no studies evaluating the influence of this protection on the performance of the LFpen on permanent teeth, or comparing it to the original LF device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred nineteen permanent molars were assessed by two experienced dentists using the LF and the LFpen devices, both with and without PVC wrapping. The teeth were histologically prepared and assessed for caries extension. RESULTS: The LF values with and without PVC wrapping were significantly different. For both LF devices, the sensitivity and accuracy were lower when the PVC wrapping was used. The specificity was statistically significantly higher for the LFpen with PVC. No difference was found between the areas under the ROC curves with and without PVC wrapping. The ICC showed excellent interexaminer agreement. The Bland and Altman method showed a range between the upper and the lower limits of agreement of 63.4 and 57.8 units for the LF device, and 49.4 and 74.2 for the LFpen device, with and without PVC wrapping, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found an influence of the PVC wrapping on the performance of the LF and LFpen devices. However, since its influence on detection of occlusal caries lesions is considered for, the use of one PVC layer is suggested to avoid cross-contamination in clinical practice.",M2

The aim of this study was to determine DEHP degradation and migration from PVC sheets. To this end, the method for the simultaneous determination of DEHP and its breakdown products (mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP) and phthalic acid (PA)) was improved. Their migration levels from 0 to 50 kGy gamma-ray irradiated PVC sheets were determined. DEHP migration level decreased in proportion to the dose of gamma-ray irradiation, while MEHP and PA migration levels increased. The hardness and the elastic modulus of PVC sheets were examined, but no clear relationship between DEHP migration and these parameters was observed.",M2
19338595,"Delayed reactions to reusable protective gloves.The materials in plastic protective gloves are thought to cause less contact allergy than rubber gloves. Our aim was to estimate the frequency of delayed reactions to different types of reusable protective gloves among dermatitis patients. 2 x 2 cm pieces of polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) gloves, nitrile gloves, and natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves were tested as is in consecutive dermatitis patients tested with the baseline series. Among 658 patients, 6 patients reacted to PVC gloves and 6 patients to the NRL gloves. None reacted to both these types of gloves. Five of six patients with reactions to rubber gloves reacted to thiuram mix in the baseline series. Delayed reactions to reusable PVC gloves may be as common as to reusable NRL gloves. In contrast to most reactions to the NRL glove, the reactions to the PVC glove had no obvious association with reactions to any allergen(s) in the baseline series.",M2
19295033,"Degradation of polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) / hydrolyzed collagen (HC) blends active sludge test.Biodegradable polymers represent a solution for the environment protection: they decrease the landfill space, by declining the petrochemical sources, and offer also an alternative solution for the recycling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The behavior during degradation in the presence of active sludge of some polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based blends with variable content of hydrolyzed collagen (HC) has been followed. Some samples were subjected to UV irradiation, for 30 hours. The modifications induced in the environment by the polymer systems (pH variation, bacterial composition), as well as the changes of the properties of the blends (weight losses, aspect etc.) were studied. RESULTS: During the first moments of degradation in active sludge, all the samples absorbed water, behavior which favored the biodegradation. The bacteriological analysis of the sludge indicates the presence of some microbiological species. Generally, the populations of microorganisms decrease, excepting the sulphito-reducing anaerobic bacteria, the actinomycetes and other anaerobic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: PVC/HC blends are degraded with a significant rate in active sewage sludge. More susceptible for the degradation are the UV irradiated blends. After the migration of the components with a small molecular mass in the environment, the natural polymer is degraded. The degradation effect increases with the content in the natural polymer.",M2
19279162,"Permeation of hair dye ingredients, p-phenylenediamine and aminophenol isomers, through protective gloves.Skin irritation and contact allergies are skin disorders common to hairdressers. The predominant oxidative hair dye components, such as p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and aminophenol isomers, can cause contact dermatitis. Use of protective gloves can prevent dermal contact with skin irritants. This study investigates the permeation behaviors of p-aminophenol (PAP), m-aminophenol (MAP), o-aminophenol (OAP) and PPD in single and mixed challenge solutions with disposable natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves, disposable polyvinylchloride (<e>PVC</e>) gloves and neoprene (NP) gloves. The challenge solutions were 4% PPD (w/v), 3% OAP (w/v), 2% PAP (w/v) and 2% MAP (w/v) in ethanol or 12% hydrogen peroxide solutions. The cocktail solutions of the four chemicals were also tested. An American Society for Testing and Materials type permeation cell, ethanol liquid collection and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection of samples taken from the collection medium every 10 min facilitated determination of breakthrough times (BTs), cumulative permeated masses and steady-state permeation rates (SSPRs). Experiments were 4 h long for the NRL and PVC gloves and 8 h for NP gloves. No chemicals tested broke through the NP gloves when exposed for 8 h. In the ethanol solution, PPD and OAP started breaking through the PVC gloves at 40 min. The SSPRs of PVC gloves were higher than those for NRL gloves in all challenge conditions for both single chemicals and mixtures. No tested chemicals in hydrogen peroxide solutions permeated the gloves during the 4-h tests. The chemical composition of the challenge solution was a main effecter of BTs and SSPRs for the NRL glove. For disposable PVC gloves, the main factors of BTs were molecular size [molar volume (MV)] and polarity (logK(ow)), and the primary factors of SSPRs were concentration, MV and logK(ow). In conclusion, disposable NRL gloves and disposable PVC gloves should not be used repeatedly for handling the hair dye products. Hydrogen peroxide did not accelerate chemical breakthrough. The compositions of the challenge solutions and physical and chemical properties (MV and logK(ow)) affected permeation behaviors for different gloves.",M2

19231073,"Generation of hydrogen from polyvinyl chloride by milling and heating with CaO and Ni(OH)2.This work discusses an alternative process option for the treatment of polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) by producing hydrogen (H(2)) gas, at the same time fixing chlorine for proper environmental control. In the first-stage, a milling operation is performed in a planetary ball mill to obtain a mixture of PVC sample with CaO and Ni(OH)(2) to be used as feed in the second-step, involving heating of the milled product. Analyses by thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) and gas chromatography (GC) showed H(2), CH(4), CO and CO(2) as main constituents. The results clearly show that addition of Ni(OH)(2) to provide nickel as catalyst and CaO as adsorbent to fix CO(2) and HCl gases generated during heating, assisted in clean H(2) generation with concentration near 90% at temperatures between 450 and 550 degrees C. Analyses of solids after heating by X-ray diffraction and TG-DTA techniques showed both CaOHCl and CaCO(3) as main phases in the product. This process could be developed to treat PVC wastes together with other polymers and/or plastic wastes for production of H(2) gas.",M2
19219280,"Treatment of invasive fungal infections: stability of voriconazole infusion solutions in <e>PVC</e> bags.Voriconazole is a novel broad-spectrum antifungal drug, employed in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, and represents an alternative to amphotericin B treatment. The manufacturer recommends that any unused reconstituted product should be stored at 2 masculineC to 8 masculineC, for no more than 24 h, but no recommendations about i.v. infusion solutions are given. Previous works have reported on the stability of voriconazole in polyolefin bags and just one in 5% dextrose polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags, at a 4 mg.mL-1 concentration. In this work, the stability of voriconazole as an i.v. infusion solution in 0.9% sodium chloride and in 5% dextrose, in PVC bags, at 0.5 mg.mL-1, stored at 4 masculineC and at room temperature, protected from light, was evaluated. These infusion solutions were analyzed for a 21-day period. Chemical stability was evaluated by HPLC assay. Visual inspection was performed and pH of the solutions was measured. No color change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. The drug content remained above 90% for 11 days in 0.9% sodium chloride and for 9 days in 5% dextrose solutions. The i.v. infusion solutions stored at room temperature were not stable. At room temperature, the voriconazole content dropped down to 88.3 and 86.6%, in 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose solutions, respectively, two days after admixture.

19209583,"Coupled recycling of <e>PVC</e> and glass wastes producing chlorine-free fuels and cement feed stock.To utilize PVC and glass wastes in a landfill, a kinetic study was conducted for neutralization of HCl derived from PVC pyrolysis with sodium in soda glass. The effective diffusion coefficient of sodium at 550 degrees C was 3.3 x 10(-16) m2/s in steam atmosphere, but was 1.2 x 10(-17) m2/s in dry atmosphere. It was confirmed from experimental results in which considerable NaCl crystals were deposited on the surface of glass particles after 6 h reaction with particles of 25 microm in diameter that NaCl crystals' growth on the glass surface does not affect the neutralization rate rate in our experimental conditions. The effect of hydrothermal treatment was studied for the glass treated at 250 degrees C under a vapor pressure of 3.6 MPa for 5 h. Approximately 20 times higher rate than that of original glass was caused by the formation of the porous surface layer through which sodium ions can readily diffuse out The effect was not clear until steam pressure reached the above value. The absence of chlorine within the glass matrix was confirmed by EDS analysis on the cross section of glass cullets reacted with HCl gas. Neutralization of HCl gas with soda-glass conducted under steam atmosphere to increase the reaction rate is effective to recover energy and material from PVC and glass wastes.",M2
19206778,"Finite element modeling of the temperature rise due to the propagation of ultrasonic waves in viscoelastic materials and experimental validation.The ultrasound stimulated thermography method is usually used to detect the temperature rise at a defect position. The temperature rise can be due to the friction between the edges of the defect and/or the plastic deformation around the defect. This paper presents another aspect of the method when the ultrasounds are propagating in a viscoelastic anisotropic material, such as polymers or fiber-reinforced polymers. The attenuation of the waves produces a distributed temperature field. Therefore, even a defect that does not produce some heat can be detected, the ultrasonic field is modified. A finite element model is used for computing the temperature field and for predicting the possibility for an infrared camera of detecting the temperature rise and its modification due to a defect. The model computes the stress and displacement fields associated with the propagation and the loss of energy. Then the heat equation is solved with this loss as a source of heating. An experiment is done with a sonotrode that excites a <e>PVC</e> plate. The ultrasonic displacement at the top of the plate is measured with a laser velocimeter and introduced in the model.

STUDY DESIGN: The study has a prospective and comparative design. METHODS: Nineteen patients with long-term tracheostomy, attending the National Respiratory Center in Sweden, were included, n = 6 with Si tubes, n = 8 with PVC tubes, and n = 5 with PU tubes. The tubes were exposed to the local environment in the trachea for 3 and 6 months and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. RESULTS: All tubes revealed severe surface changes. No significant differences were established after 3 or 6 months of exposure between the various materials. The changes had progressed significantly after this period, compared to previously reported changes after 30 days of exposure. The results from all analyzing techniques correlated well. CONCLUSIONS: All tubes, exposed in the trachea for 3-6 months, revealed major degradation and changes in the surface of the material. Polymeric tracheostomy tubes should be changed before the end of 3 months of clinical use.",M2

19181753,"Interaction of plasma proteins with commercial protein repellent polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>): a word of caution.Protein adsorption onto polymers remains a problem. In recent years, several protein-repellent PVC tubings have been developed. Although several studies report the interaction between plasma coagulation proteins and PVC, few address the interaction with other plasma proteins. Two commercial brands of untreated medical grade PVC tubing, phosphorylcholine-coated PVC tubing, triblock-copolymer (polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone)-treated PVC tubing and poly-2-methoxyethylacrylate (PMEA)-coated tubing were exposed for 60 minutes to human plasma. A broad spectrum of plasma proteins was found on all tubing. The adsorbed albumin to total protein ratio is lower than the similar ratio in plasma while alpha1 and alpha2 globulins are over-represented in the protein spectrum. On PMEA tubing, not only alpha globulins, but also beta and gamma globulins, are found in high concentrations in the adsorbed protein. PMEA tubing and uncoated PVC tubing of brand B had a higher amount of protein adsorbed compared against all other tubing (p &lt; 0.05). There were no statistical differences in protein adsorption between the triblock-copolymer-treated tubing, the phosphorylcholine-coated tubing and the uncoated PVC tubing of brand A. The average thickness of the protein layer was 23 nm. Plasma protein adsorption still exists on uncoated and protein-repellent tubing and can initiate a systemic inflammatory reaction.",M2
19166721,"Complexes of tetra-tert-butyl-tetraazaporphine with Al(III) and Zr(IV) cations as fluoride selective ionophores.In this work, complexes of Zr(IV) and Al(III) cations with 2,7,12,17-tetra-tert-butyl-5,10,15,20-tetraazaporphine (TAP) were tested as ionophores in plasticized <e>PVC</e> membranes of ion-selective electrodes. It was found that both tested ionophores show enhanced affinity towards fluoride anion. High fluoride selectivity was observed in the presence of anionic or cationic additives in the membrane, which indicates that proposed compounds work according to charged or neutral carrier mechanism, depending on membrane composition and pretreatment. tert-Butyl substituents, present in the structure of tested compounds, were supposed to prevent formation of ionophore dimers within the membrane phase. This process was found to be responsible for some unfavorable potentiometric properties of electrodes based on complexes of Zr(IV) and Al(III) cations with porphyrins (compounds closely related to tetra-tert-butyl-5,10,15,20-tetraazaporphine). As it was shown using spectrophotometrical measurements, Al(III)-TAP was not susceptible to dimerization, while dimer formation was observed for Zr(IV)-TAP. In full agreement with these observations, electrodes with membranes containing Al(III)-TAP responded in near-Nernstian and fast manner towards fluoride anion, while the employment of Zr(IV)-TAP as ionophore resulted in super-Nernstian and sluggish response. Plasticized PVC membranes doped with Al(III)-TAP and 20mol% of lipophilic anionic additives shown remarkable F(-) selectivity, with selectivity coefficients, logK(F-pot.).(Y-), as follows: -4.4 (Y(-)Br(-)), -4.3 (Cl(-)), -4.2 (NO(3)(-)), -3.6 (SCN(-)), -2.9 (ClO(4)(-)).",M2
19155169,"Selective separation of virgin and post-consumer polymers (PET and <e>PVC</e>) by flotation method.More and more polymer wastes are generated by industry and householders today. Recycling is an important process to reduce the amount of waste resulting from human activities. Currently, recycling technologies use relatively homogeneous polymers because hand-sorting waste is costly. Many promising technologies are being investigated for separating mixed thermoplastics, but they are still uneconomical and unreliable. At present, most waste polymers cause serious environmental problems. Burning polymers for recycling is not practiced since poisonous gases are released during the burning process. Particularly, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials among waste polymers generate hazardous HCl gas, dioxins containing Cl, etc., which lead to air pollution and shorten the life of the incinerator. In addition, they make other polymers difficult to recycle. Both polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PVC have densities of 1.30-1.35g /cm(3) and cannot be separated using conventional gravity separation techniques. For this reason, polymer recycling needs new techniques. Among these techniques, froth flotation, which is also used in mineral processing, can be useful because of its low cost and simplicity. The main objective of this research is to recycle PET and PVC selectively from post-consumer polymer wastes and virgin polymers by using froth flotation. According to the results, all PVC particles were floated with 98.8% efficiency in virgin polymer separation while PET particles were obtained with 99.7% purity and 57.0% efficiency in post-consumer polymer separation.",M2

Effects of various plasticizers and anion excluders were studied in detail and improved performance was observed. The best performance was obtained for the membrane sensor having a composition of L(1): PVC:1-CN:NaTPB in the ratio of 6: 32: 58: 4 (w/w; mg). The performance of the membrane based on L(1) was compared with polymeric membrane electrode (PME) as well as with coated graphite electrode (CGE). The electrodes exhibit Nernstian slope for Tb(3+) ions with limits of detection of 3.4 x 10(-8)mol L(-1) for PME and 5.7 x 10(-9)mol L(-1) for CGE. The response time for PME and CGE was found to be 10s and 8s, respectively. The potentiometric responses are independent of the pH of the test solution in the pH range 3.0-7.5 for PME and 2.0-8.5 for CGE. The CGE has found to work satisfactorily in partially non-aqueous media upto 30% (v/v) content of methanol, ethanol and 20% (v/v) content of acetonitrile and could be used for a period of 5 months.

Each tablet batch was packed in strip and blister packs and kept under accelerated temperature and humidity conditions. The stability of two tablet and packaging types was compared by HPLC analysis after 0, 1, 3 and 4.5 months and expressed as the content of intact amlodipine and atenolol. The content of atenolol did not decline regardless of tablet and packaging type. Amlodipine content in bi-layer tablets decreased to about 95 and 88% when packed in strips and blisters, respectively. When prepared as mono-layer tablets, the content decreased to 72 and 32%, respectively.The study revealed that the bi-layer tablet formulation was more stable than the mono-layer type.

In plastic 96-well microplates that contained 1.0 mg/ml of r-EPS, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) biofilms were dramatically decreased by 87% and 94% on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) surfaces, respectively. In the presence of r-EPS, neither their growth rate nor their autoinducer-2-like activity was affected on the EHEC O157:H7. Importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-EPS was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. In addition, we found that adding r-EPS significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csgA, and csgB) and chemotaxis (cheY) in transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, these r-EPS could prevent biofilm formation by a wide range of Gram-negative and -positive pathogens. This property may lead to the development of novel food-grade adjuncts for microbial biofilm control.",M2

The objectives of this study were to analyze the pollution characteristics of the emissions from the plastic waste recycling plants, particularly in harmful volatile organochlorinated compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), odor levels and critical odorants. Ten large recycling plants were selected for analysis of odor concentration (OC), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PAHs inside and outside the plants using olfactometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detector, respectively. The olfactometric results showed that the melting processes used for treating polyethylene/polypropylene (PE/PP) and polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) plastic waste significantly produced malodor, and the odor levels at downwind boundaries were 100-229 OC, which all exceeded Taiwan's EPA standard of 50 OC. Toluene, ethylbenzene, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, methyl methacrylate and acrolein accounted for most odors compared to numerous VOCs. Sixteen organochlorinated compounds were measured in the ambient air emitted from the PVC plastic waste recycling plant and total concentrations were 245-553 microg m(-3); most were vinyl chloride, chloroform and trichloroethylene. Concentrations of PAHs inside the PE/PP plant were 8.97-252.16 ng m(-3), in which the maximum level were 20-fold higher than the levels detected from boundaries. Most of these recycling plants simply used filter to treat the melting fumes, and this could not efficiently eliminate the gaseous compounds and malodor. Improved exhaust air pollution control were strongly recommended in these industries.",M2
19077392,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate leakage and color changes in endotracheal tubes after application in high-risk newborns.BACKGROUND: Polyvinylchloride (<e>PVC</e>) is often adopted for making medical devices. OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that materials degradation occurs in PVC endotracheal tubes during infant ventilation, thus releasing the known toxic plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endotracheal tubes degradation was assessed by: (1) analysis of color and spectral changes in endotracheal tubes after use in the 400- to 700-nm range and compared to virgin samples. Color changes were expressed as euclidean distances in the Commission International de l'Eclairage Laboratory and Lightness-Chroma-Hue (Munsell's) color spaces (i.e., Delta E, Delta L, Delta a, Delta b, Delta C, and Delta H units); (2) DEHP leakage was assessed by thermal characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Data from used tubes were compared with those from either virgin devices or submitted to artificial aging, including O(2)-induced oxidation, washing, UV photodegradation and exposition to acid solutions. RESULTS: Significant color differences of 13.33 +/- 0.85 Delta E were evidenced in used endotracheal tubes, as compared to virgin samples (p &lt; 0.0001). Chromatic changes were independent from intubation duration. DSC and TGA analyses showed a loss of DEHP from used tubes, as indicated by increase of the glass transition temperature (Tg) and DEHP weight loss. In vivo application of tubes was associated with an aging process whose effects on the optical and spectral properties were similar to those observed following artificial aging processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that significant spectrocolorimetric, DSC and TGA changes occur in endotracheal tubes after application, thus demonstrating for the first time the occurrence of in vivo materials degradation and DEHP leakage from medical devices worldwide used for neonatal ventilation.",M2

19027840,"Investigation into the sorption of nitroglycerin and diazepam into <e>PVC</e> tubes and alternative tube materials during application.Plastic bags and tubes are increasingly used for the storage and application of pharmaceutical formulations. The most common polymer material for drug application sets is plasticized poly(vinylchloride) (PVC). During application of pharmaceutical drug solution through PVC tubes, the polymer and the contact media interact which leads to leaching out of polymer additives or sorption of ingredients of the drug solution. Whereas the discussion of leaching of plasticizers is focussed on the toxicological properties of a drug packaging system, the sorption of drug formulation compounds has an influence on the dosage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient resulting in a reduced drug delivery to the patient. Therefore sorption has an influence on the effectiveness and success of the therapy. Within the study, the concentration profiles of nitroglycerin and diazepam solutions were determined after pumping the solutions through infusion administration sets. The study includes plasticized PVC tubes with different plasticizers (DEHP, DEHA, DEHT, TEHTM, DINCH, poly adipate), PVC (DEHP) tubes with different shore hardness as well as alternative polymer materials like EVA, TPE, PUR, silicone, LDPE and PP. From the experimental concentration curves it could be shown, that in the first minutes of the application of the drug solution the sorption of the active compound is at its maximum, resulting in the lowest concentration in the applied pharmaceutical solution. For a PVC tube with DEHP as plasticizer and a shore hardness of 80 only about 57% of the initial nitroglycerin concentration in the solution is applied to the patient in the first minutes of the application. For PVC tube (DEHP, shore 80) the experimental data were simulated using mathematical diffusion models. The concentration profiles during application could be well simulated using the partition coefficient K=50 (nitroglycerin) and K=300 (diazepam), respectively. However, the experimental results indicate, that the sorption of nitroglycerin into the PVC tube alters the diffusion behaviour of the polymer over flow time, which results in an increase of the diffusion coefficient during application. On the other hand, the other investigated alternative tube materials like PE or PP show a significantly lower sorption compared to PVC plasticizer systems. Due to the fact that the amount of sorption is varying over time, the concentration of the active pharmaceutical compound in the solution after passing the infusion administration set is not constant which makes the application of a constant concentration of a certain active ingredient to the patient very difficult. The simulated partition and diffusion coefficients for given PVC(DEHP) tubes were therefore used to simulate the initial concentrations profile of the feeding drug solution to assure a constant concentration flow profile after passing the administration set. The proposed methodology of this study represents a straight forward approach for the assessment of the drug sorption in dynamic flow systems based on experimental data as well as mathematical diffusion modelling. From the results a non-constant initial concentration profile for the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug solution can be established in order to compensate the loss of the pharmaceutical compound by sorption during infusion.",M2

The main factors such as pH, amount of ligand and PVC, amount and type of surfactant, and condition of eluting solutions on the sorption recovery of metal ions have been investigated in detail. The relative standard deviation was found in the range of 1.0-3.2% for 0.2 microg mL(-1)of metals ions. After optimization of the extraction condition and the instrumental parameters, a detection limit was found to be in the range of 1.2-3.1 microg L(-1), with enrichment factor of 50 was achieved.

18990931,"Estimated risks of water and saliva contamination by phthalate diffusion from plasticized polyvinyl chloride.Phthalates are additives commonly used to convert hard polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) resins into flexible and workable plastics employed in the production of chewable rubber toys and other soft-plastic products. In theory, phthalates can diffuse in small quantities to the surface of a product, and from there they can enter the environment and the human body. The purpose of this study was to determine the diffusion of phthalates from plasticized PVC in water and artificial saliva; to determine the migration of di(2-ethylhexyl) (DEHP) phthalate in human saliva using gas chromatography; to compare the experimental values with theoretical values calculated using a model based on the principles of molecular diffusion in fluids; and to use the experimental values to estimate daily doses of DEHP received by Mexican children and infants using plastic and soft-plastic products (e.g., pacifiers, chewable toys, and bottles). Our findings indicated phthalate diffusion of 0.36 microg/cm2 per hour and 4.10 microg/cm2 per hour, respectively, in water and artificial saliva. The average value of phthalate diffusion in vivo was 6.04 microg/cm2 per hour. The daily oral phthalate exposure in Mexican infants and toddlers from oral use of rubber toys and soft-plastic products is 18.12 microg/kg.

Biofilms composed of indigenous water system bacteria were accumulated on copper and polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) pipe material surfaces in a low-flow pipe loop and uniformly mixed tank reactor (CDC biofilm reactor). Application of a distributed shear during spore contact resulted in approximately a 1.0 and 1.6 log10 increase in the number of spores associated with copper and PVC surfaces, respectively. Decontamination of spores in both free suspension and after association with biofilm-conditioned pipe materials was attempted using free chlorine and monochloramine. Associated spores required 5- to 10-fold higher disinfectant concentrations to observe the same reduction of viable spores as in suspension. High disinfectant concentrations (103 mg/L free chlorine and 49 mg/L monochloramine) yielded less than a 2-log10 reduction in viable associated spores after 60 min. Spores associated with biofilms on copper surfaces consistently yielded higher Ct values than PVC.",M2
18939596,"Reduced migration from flexible poly(vinyl chloride) of a plasticizer containing beta-cyclodextrin derivative.The migration of endocrine-disrupting di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) poses a serious threat to public health and the environment. In this study, we successfully prepared a plasticizerwith reduced DEHP migration by directly incorporating 2,3,6-per-O-benzoyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Bz-beta-CD) into DEHP. Bz-beta-CD was prepared by esterification between the hydroxyl groups of beta-CD and benzoyl chloride. The presence of this cyclodextrin is expected to facilitate formation of stable complexes through pi-pi association with DEHP molecules. The flexible <e>PVC</e> was prepared with a gelation-fusion process that uses the prepared migration-resistant plasticizer, and its properties (flexibility, thermal stability, and clarity) were evaluated by carrying out DSC and tensile testing, TGA, and haze testing, respectively. No significant changes in the physical properties of the flexible PVC were observed when Bz-beta-CD was added. DEHP migration tests were carried out for the flexible PVC according to the ISO 3826:1993(E) test method, and the quantity of migrated DEHP was then determined with UV-vis spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of Bz-beta-CD decreases the levels of DEHP migration from the flexible PVC samples by almost 40%. We investigated the molecular interaction between Bz-beta-CD and DEHP using molecular mechanics simulations, and we conclude that this reduction in DEHP migration is due to the formation of stabilized pi-pi attractive association and inclusion complexes of Bz-beta-CD and DEHP in flexible PVC.",M2

In this study, pooled buffy coat platelets stored in Fresenius/NPBI polyolefin bags were compared with those stored in Fresenius/NPBI butyryl-trihexyl citrate (BTHC) plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The CompoSelect thrombocyte polishing filter system (1000 mL polyolefin bag) and the CompoStop F730 system (1300 mL BTHC-PVC bag) were used to prepare paired, plasma-suspended, buffy coat platelet concentrates. Samples were taken up to day 7 for in vitro analysis. In a separate experiment, 12 units were prepared using the CompoStop F730 system and samples taken after leucofiltration for FXIIa assay. By day 7, platelet concentrates stored in BTHC-PVC demonstrated significantly higher pH levels (7.32 +/- 0.05 vs. 7.26 +/- 0.05) and a greater degree of cell lysis as shown by increased lactate dehydrogenase levels (497 +/- 107 vs. 392 +/- 81 U L(-1)). The supernatants contained higher concentrations of soluble P-selectin and the chemokine 'regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted', which are released from the alpha-granules during activation. The ATP concentrations were significantly lower in BTHC-PVC. Platelet counts, mean platelet volume and hypotonic shock response were similar for both bags. FXIIa antigen concentrations were 0.6 +/- 0.2 ng mL(-1) indicating that activation of the contact factor pathway had not occurred. Although the CompoStop F730 leucoreduction filter did not activate the contact system, platelets stored in 100% plasma in BTHC-PVC bags demonstrated different in vitro characteristics from those stored in polyolefin.

Moreover, from thermogravimetric analysis, it was found that for PVC/PEG the decomposition of PVC corresponding to the dehydrochlorination stage shifted to lower temperatures compared with that of pure PVC, suggesting some interactions exist between PEG and PVC that caused the faster dehydrochlorination rate. In addition, during this process, no waste byproducts such as KCl have been produced, and satisfactory recyclability of PEG (10 cycles) has been obtained.",M2
18713919,"A comparison of a silicone wire-reinforced tube with the Parker and polyvinyl chloride tubes for tracheal intubation through an intubating laryngeal mask airway in patients with normal airways undergoing general anesthesia.BACKGROUND: The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) is used in the management of difficult intubation. Usually, a silicone wire-reinforced tube is inserted for tracheal intubation. Because the silicone wire-reinforced tube is expensive, alternatives, such as polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) and posterior beveled Parker tubes, are worth considering. We compared the blind intubation success rates among the silicone wire-reinforced tube, the Parker tube, and the PVC tube, and identified laryngeal structures preventing tracheal intubations through the ILMA. METHODS: Sixty-three adult patients were randomized into three groups: Group I (n = 20) silicone wire-reinforced tube, Group II (n = 21) Parker tube, and Group III (n = 22) PVC tube. Demographic and clinical continuous data were compared with the analysis of variance with the Scheffé test for post hoc analysis. Frequencies and percentages were compared with the chi(2) test. RESULTS: Tracheal intubation was successful from the first attempt in 18 of 20 patients in Group I (silicone wire-reinforced tube), which was significantly higher than the success rate in either Group II (12 of 22 patients) (Parker tube) or Group III (10 of 21 patients) (PVC tube). With clockwise or anticlockwise rotation of the tracheal tube, the number of successful intubations did not change in Group I, but it increased to 19 of 22 patients in Group II and to 12 of 21 patients in Group III. The rate of successful intubation between patients in Group I (90%) and Group II (86%) was not significantly different after manipulation of the tracheal tube (P = 0.72). However, the rate of successful tracheal intubations in patients of Group III (57%) was significantly lower in comparison to patients in both Group I (P = 0.02) and Group II (P = 0.03). In 3 of the 22 patients of Group II and in 9 of the 21 patients of Group III in whom blind intubation was not possible, the obstruction was due to the epiglottis tubercule. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulation improved the success rate of intubation with the Parker tube through the ILMA rendering it a possible alternative to the silicone wire-reinforced tube.",M2
18691863,"Properties of lightweight aggregate concrete prepared with <e>PVC</e> granules derived from scraped PVC pipes.This paper aims to investigate the fresh and hardened properties of lightweight aggregate concretes that are prepared with the use of recycled plastic waste sourced from scraped PVC pipes to replace river sand as fine aggregates. A number of laboratory prepared concrete mixes were tested, in which river sand was partially replaced by PVC plastic waste granules in percentages of 0%, 5%, 15%, 30% and 45% by volume. Two major findings are identified. The positive side shows that the concrete prepared with a partial replacement by PVC was lighter (lower density), was more ductile (greater Poisson's ratios and reduced modulus of elasticity), and had lower drying shrinkage and higher resistance to chloride ion penetration. The negative side reveals that the workability, compressive strength and tensile splitting strength of the concretes were reduced. The results gathered would form a part of useful information for recycling PVC plastic waste in lightweight concrete mixes.",M2
18671410,"Elimination of undesirable water layers in solid-contact polymeric ion-selective electrodes.This study aimed to develop a novel approach for the production of analytically robust and miniaturized polymeric ion sensors that are vitally important in modern analytical chemistry (e.g., clinical chemistry using single blood droplets, modern biosensors measuring clouds of ions released from nanoparticle-tagged biomolecules, laboratory-on-a-chip applications, etc.). This research has shown that the use of a water-repellent poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(decyl methacrylate) (PMMA/PDMA) copolymer as the ion-sensing membrane, along with a hydrophobic poly(3-octylthiophene 2,5-diyl) (POT) solid contact as the ion-to-electron transducer, is an excellent strategy for avoiding the detrimental water layer formed at the buried interface of solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (ISEs). Accordingly, it has been necessary to implement a rigorous surface analysis scheme employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in situ neutron reflectometry/EIS (NR/EIS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe structurally the solid-contact/membrane interface, so as to identify the conditions that eliminate the undesirable water layer in all solid-state polymeric ion sensors. In this work, we provide the first experimental evidence that the PMMA/PDMA copolymer system is susceptible to water  pooling  at the interface in areas surrounding physical imperfections in the solid contact, with the exposure time for such an event in a PMMA/PDMA copolymer ISE taking nearly 20 times longer than that for a plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>) ISE, and the simultaneous use of a hydrophobic POT solid contact with a PMMA/PDMA membrane can eliminate totally this water layer problem.",M2
18662020,"Online in-tube solid-phase extraction using a nonfunctionalized <e>PVC</e> tube coupled with ICPMS for in vivo monitoring of trace metals in rat brain microdialysates.We have developed a simple, automatic, online in-tube solid-phase extraction (SPE) method for the preconcentration of trace elements from saline samples. The method takes advantage of the adsorption of trace metal ions onto the interior of a nonfunctionalized PVC tube as a means of separation from the matrix salt. The adsorption of transition metal ions is presumably dominated by Lewis acid/base interactions, which facilitate the formation of metal-PVC complexes. For simultaneous determination of multiple trace metals in the extracellular fluid from the brains of anesthetized rats, we developed an online analytical system comprising microdialysis sampling, the established in-tube extraction procedure, and ICPMS. In the extraction step, the efficiency was optimal when the pH of the sample was adjusted to 8.0 using phosphate buffer. After extraction onto the interior of PVC tube, the adsorbed analytes were eluted with 0.5% HNO 3 prior to online ICPMS measurement. For those elements present in the extracellular fluid at less than nanogram-per-milliliter concentrations (i.e., Cu, Zn, and Mn), a temporal resolution of 12 min was required to collect enough microdialysate to meet the sensitivity requirements of the ICPMS instrument. Noteworthily, because washing and postconditioning the interior of PVC tube are not necessary, a relatively unsophisticated and clean procedure was attained and extremely low detection limits in the range of 5.0 to 510 ng L (-1) were thus obtained for the analysis of Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Co in microdialysate samples of 8 microL by ICPMS. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to exploit PVC peristaltic tubing as an SPE adsorbent in the laboratory-on-valve mode for online sample treatment and trace metal preconcentration prior to ICPMS measurement. We confirmed the analytical reliability of this method through the analysis of the certified reference material SLEW-3 (estuarine water) and 2670a (human urine) and demonstrated its applicability through simultaneous in vivo monitoring of the basal concentrations and concentration profiles of multiple metal ions in the brain extracellular fluid of a living rat.",M2
18656670,"Anion recognition using newly synthesized hydrogen bonding disubstituted phenylhydrazone-based receptors: poly(vinyl chloride)-based sensor for acetate.A potentiometric acetate-selective sensor, based on the use of butane-2,3-dione,bis[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydrazone] (BDH) as a neutral carrier in poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>) matrix, is reported. Effect of various plasticizers and cation excluder, cetryaltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was studied. The best performance was obtained with a membrane composition of PVC:BDH:CTAB ratio (w/w; mg) of 160:8:8. The sensor exhibits significantly enhanced selectivity toward acetate ions over a wide concentration range 5.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-1)M with a lower detection limit of 1.2 x 10(-6)M within pH range 6.5-7.5 with a response time of &lt;15s and a Nernstian slope of 60.3+/-0.3 mV decade(-1) of activity. Influences of the membrane composition, and possible interfering anions were investigated on the response properties of the electrode. Fast and stable response, good reproducibility and long-term stability are demonstrated. The sensor has a response time of 15s and can be used for at least 65 days without any considerable divergence in their potential response. Selectivity coefficients determined with the separate solution method (SSM) and fixed interference method (FIM) indicate that high selectivity for acetate ion. The proposed electrode shows fairly good discrimination of acetate from several inorganic and organic anions. It was successfully applied to direct determination of acetate within food preservatives. Total concentration of acetic acid in vinegar samples were determined by direct potentiometry and the values agreed with those mentioned by the manufacturers.",M2
18649554,"[Pyrolysis characteristics of medical waste compositions containing <e>PVC</e> (polyvinyl chloride)]To obtain pyrolysis characteristics of medical waste compositions containing PVC (polyvinyl chloride), thermogravimetric study of tube for transfusion (TFT) and sample collector for urine (SCFU) was carried out using the thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) with N2. The heat change in pyrolysis process was analyzed and the properties of pyrolysis residues are reported. The mathematics model with two-step and four-reaction was established to simulate the pyrolysis process. The results show that: 1) The pyrolysis mechanism of the two samples is in agreement with that of PVC. The decomposition process appears two stages in 200 - 390 degrees C and 390 - 550 degrees C, which are clearly expressed with two prominent peaks with maximum rate of weight loss at about 315 degrees C and 470 degrees C. 2) Complex ingredients in samples result in irregular and uneven shape of DTG peaks, in which plasticizer lowers the antichloration temperature and enhances the weight loss rate. 3) The model could satisfactorily describe the weight loss and differential process of TFT and SCFU.",M2
18629304,"The role of exposure to phthalates from polyvinyl chloride products in the development of asthma and allergies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Phthalates from polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) plastics may have adverse effects on airways and immunologic systems, but the evidence has not been reviewed systematically. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the evidence for the role of exposure to phthalates from PVC products in the development of asthma and allergies. METHODS: We conducted a Medline database search (1950 through May 2007) for relevant studies on the respiratory and allergic effects of exposure to phthalates from PVC products. RESULTS: We based this review on 27 human and 14 laboratory toxicology studies. Two mouse inhalation experiments indicated that mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) has the ability to modulate the immune response to exposure to a coallergen. The data suggested a no observed effect level of 30 microg MEHP/m3, calculated to be below the estimated level of human exposure in common environments. Case reports and series (n = 9) identified and verified cases of asthma that were very likely caused by fumes emitted from PVC film. Epidemiologic studies in adults (n = 10), mostly small studies in occupational settings, showed associations between heated PVC fumes and asthma and respiratory symptoms; studies in children (n = 5) showed an association between PVC surface materials in the home and the risk of asthma [fixed-effects model: summary odds ratio (OR), 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-2.05; four studies] and allergies (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60; three studies). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of phthalates from PVC products can modulate the murine immune response to a coallergen. Heated PVC fumes possibly contribute to development of asthma in adults. Epidemiologic studies in children show associations between indicators of phthalate exposure in the home and risk of asthma and allergies. The lack of objective exposure information limits the epidemiologic data.",M2
18614831,"Atropine-selective membrane electrodes and relative selectivity concept.TFPB was introduced as a charged ionophore for atropine selective electrodes. Typical Nernstian responses were found (57.78, 58.95 and 58.41 mV/decade) for <e>PVC</e>-membrane electrodes incorporating NPOE, DOS, and DDP as plasticizers. They exhibited practical linear ranges of 9.1 x 10(-3) - 10(-6), 9.1 x 10(-3) - 10(-6) and 9.1 x 10(-3) - 10(-7) M, respectively. It works in the sub-micro scale of atropine concentrations. The optimum pH-range was 3.18 - 8.97. The selectivity coefficient values were estimated for different organic and inorganic cations. They were interpreted by using the  Relative Selectivity Concept , which was introduced for the first time. The new concept was applied for comparing the selectivity properties of previously reported electrodes. The effect of the presence of ephedrine, caffeine, glucose, Na(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) on the calibration graphs of the electrodes was studied.",M2
18614363,"Adsorptive removal of copper and nickel ions from water using chitosan coated <e>PVC</e> beads.A new biosorbent was developed by coating chitosan, a naturally and abundantly available biopolymer, on to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) beads. The biosorbent was characterized by FTIR spectra, porosity and surface area analyses. Equilibrium and column flow adsorption characteristics of copper(II) and nickel(II) ions on the biosorbent were studied. The effect of pH, agitation time, concentration of adsorbate and amount of adsorbent on the extent of adsorption was investigated. The experimental data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The data were analyzed on the basis of Lagergren pseudo first order, pseudo-second order and Weber-Morris intraparticle diffusion models. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of chitosan coated PVC sorbent as obtained from Langmuir adsorption isotherm was found to be 87.9 mg g(-1) for Cu(II) and 120.5 mg g(-1) for Ni(II) ions, respectively. In addition, breakthrough curves were obtained from column flow experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that chitosan coated PVC beads could be used for the removal of Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions from aqueous medium through adsorption.",M2
18607273,"Extraction of diethylhexylphthalate by home total parenteral nutrition from polyvinyl chloride infusion lines commonly used in the home.OBJECTIVES: Recently, our group detected that polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) perfusion lines leach large amounts of the toxic plasticizer diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) under conditions typical of intensive care units. In the present study, we investigated the extraction of DEHP from PVC connecting tubes that are commonly used for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. The aim of the study was to estimate the amount of DEHP to which children receiving home TPN are exposed for months and years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1000 mL of TPN, identical in constitution and amount to the home TPN of 1 of our patients, were perfused through 5 different connecting tube systems and collected in hexane-rinsed glass bottles. The concentration of DEHP in the TPN was analyzed before and after perfusion. RESULTS: Before perfusion of the lines, the solution had a DEHP concentration of 0.05 to 0.69 microg/mL (baseline value). After perfusion of the lines, the load of DEHP in the solution varied between 1.41 and 2.07 microg/mL. This TPN was established for children weighing 20 kg. The daily dosage is between 71 and 104 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1). TPN is administered at home for many months and years. The monthly charge of DEHP is between 42.3 and 62.1 mg. Children weighing 20 kg therefore receive a dosage between 2.1 and 3.1 mg x kg(-1) x month(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Diethylhexylphthalate and its metabolite monoethylhexylphthalate have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic, embryotoxic, hepatotoxic, pneumotoxic, and cardiotoxic and are known to disrupt endocrine pathways and liver detoxifying capacity in animals. They are suspected of having multiple effects in humans as well. The doses presented above should therefore be avoided in children receiving home TPN by the use of tubing systems that are completely free of DEHP. Such systems are available.",M2

18585284,"Optimization of polymeric triiodide membrane electrode based on clozapine-triiodide ion-pair using experimental design.Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were developed as experimental strategies for modeling and optimization of the influence of some variables on the performance of a new <e>PVC</e> membrane triiodide ion-selective electrode. This triiodide sensor is based on triiodide-clozapine ion-pair complexation. PVC, plasticizers, ion-pair amounts and pH were investigated as four variables to build a model to achieve the best Nernstian slope (59.9 mV) as response. The electrode is prepared by incorporating the ion-exchanger in PVC matrix plasticized with 2-nitrophenyl octal ether, which is directly coated on the surface of a graphite electrode. The influence of foreign ions on the electrode performance was also investigated. The optimized membranes demonstrate Nernstian response for triiodide ions over a wide linear range from 5.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-2)mol L(-1) with a limit of detection 2.0 x 10(-6) mol L(-1) at 25 degrees C. The electrodes could be used over a wide pH range 4-8, and have the advantages of easy to prepare, good selectivity and fast response time, long lifetime (over 3 months) and small interferences from hydrogen ion. The proposed electrode was successfully used as indicator electrode in potentiometric titration of triiodide ions and ascorbic acid.",M2

18571918,"Biocompatible ion selective electrode for monitoring metabolic activity during the growth and cultivation of human cells.Ammonia is the main nitrogenous waste product of cellular metabolism and if accumulated in culture media may limit cell growth and affect the quality of cultured cell lines. Therefore, it is crucial to control levels of this metabolite during the in vitro expansion of human cells. This paper describes the successful application of ion selective electrodes (ISE) to continuously monitor ammonium concentrations in a perfused cell bioreactor. The polymeric membranes of the ISE were cast from carboxylated poly(vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>-COOH) and doped with highly hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The PEG was incorporated into the surface of the sensors in order to reduce the effect of biofouling without impairing their analytical characteristics. The electrodes developed enabled fast and selective measurements of ammonia in the range 0.5-5mM, corresponding well with the concentration determined off-line. Additionally, the UV sterilised sensors were small and flexible enough to be readily inserted into the limited space of the bioreactor. Long-term analytical performance of PEG-modified ISE during continuous measurements in mammalian cell cultures was investigated. The sensors remained stable for the duration of the bioprocess, 7 days.",M2
18506814,"Photocatalytic and antibacterial properties of medical-grade <e>PVC</e> material coated with TiO2 film.The TiO(2) film was coated on poly vinyl chloride (PVC) surface by dip-coating process from TiO(2)-PVC-THF suspension. The morphology and crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by SEM and XRD. The photocatalytic properties were measured by the photodegradation reaction of RhB and the anti-adhesion and anti-bacteria for Escherichia coli. The results show that the resultant TiO(2) film is well-conglutinated on PVC surface and has the same crystal structure as the original TiO(2) powder. The TiO(2)/PVC shows excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of aqueous RhB and the activity increases with increasing reaction time and tends toward stable after accumulative illumination for 11.5 h. The TiO(2) film shows good bacterial anti-adhesion activity following photo-activation and sterilization property under UV irradiation.

18502595,"Determination of tris(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate released from <e>PVC</e> tube by LC-MS/MS.Tris(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate (TOTM) is used as an alternative plasticizer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) medical devices. A method for the determination of TOTM released from PVC medical devices into intravenous preparations was developed, which uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A PVC tube was filled with an intravenous preparation and extraction was carried out by shaking for 1h at room temperature. LC was performed with an Inertsil-C8 (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 microm) column. The isocratic mobile phase was acetonitrile:purified water (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. MS detection was accomplished with an MS/MS detector equipped with a turbo ionspray ionization source in the positive ion mode. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for the standard solution of TOTM was 0.5 ng/ml (S/N=3) and 1.0 ng/ml (S/N &gt; or =10), respectively. When Prograf (tacrolimus) was used, the average recovery of TOTM was 101.1% (R.S.D.=4.72%; n=3). When our method was applied to the determination of TOTM released from unsterilized and gamma-ray-sterilized PVC tubes, we found that a higher concentration of TOTM was released from the unsterilized PVC tube than from the gamma-ray-sterilized one.",M2
18471966,"Performance optimization of coagulation/flocculation in the treatment of wastewater from a polyvinyl chloride plant.This paper presents results of an experimental study of coagulation/flocculation process of wastewater generated from a polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) plant. The wastewater contains fine chlorine-based solid materials (i.e. latex). Experiments were carried out using a model wastewater which is chemically identical to the actual plant but is more consistent. Inorganic ions (Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3 and CaCl2) and a water soluble commercial polyelectrolyte (PE) were added to the wastewater sample. Coagulation efficiency was determined by measuring both the turbidity of the supernatants and the relative settlement of the flocs in the jar test. It was found that aluminum and ferric ions were more efficient than calcium ions as coagulants. The addition of polyelectrolyte was found to improve substantially the coagulation/flocculation process. It was found that the (Al2(SO4)3) combined with the polyelectrolyte at certain pH and agitation speed gave the best results compared to calcium chloride or ferric chloride when combined with the same concentration of polyelectrolyte. Only 0.0375g of a solution of (0.5% Al2(SO4)3) was required to coagulate the model wastewater. Ferric chloride (2.5% FeCl3) combined with the polyelectrolyte, on the other hand, required 0.1g while the optimum turbidity is almost the same. As for calcium chloride (2.5% CaCl2) it was found to be the least effective. The coagulation/flocculation process was found to be dependent on both pH and the agitation speed.",M2
18443859,"Realistic and affordable lo-fidelity model for learning bronchoscopic transbronchial needle aspiration.BACKGROUND: Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is used to sample mediastinal abnormalities and lymph node stations for diagnostic purposes and lung cancer staging. The procedure is underused, operator dependent, and reputed to have a steep learning curve. Other difficulties arise from a bronchoscopist's failure to insert the needle satisfactorily into the target node. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the realism and helpfulness of a lo-fidelity, easily constructed hybrid model used for learning and practicing TBNA. METHODS: The model is constructed by attaching a porcine tracheobronchial tree to a Laerdal Airway Model mounted on polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>) piping. Twelve individuals with various levels of bronchoscopy training and experience were given a 15-min introductory PowerPoint presentation on TBNA strategy and planning, execution, and response to complications. Participants then practiced TBNA alone and with guidance, aided by an assistant, as many times as individually necessary to feel comfortable with the procedure. A five-point Likert scale 8-item questionnaire was then completed. RESULTS: Participants were unanimously positive about their experience (mean scores 4.25-4.91). The model was realistic, provided increased comfort with TBNA techniques, and allowed practice of communication skills.

18545443,"Material thickness optimization for transmission-mode terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.The thickness of a sample material for a transmission-mode terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurement is the subject of interest in this paper. A sample that is too thick or too thin can raise the problem of measurement uncertainty. Although greater thickness allows the terahertz radiation--or T-rays--to interact more with bulk material, the SNR rolls off with thickness due to signal attenuation. A sample that is too thin renders itself nearly invisible to T-rays, in such a way that the system can hardly sense the difference between the sample and a free space path. The optimal trade-off is analyzed and revealed in this paper, where our approach is to find the optimal thickness that results in the minimal uncertainty of measured optical constants. The derived model for optimal thickness is supported by the results from experiments performed with polyvinyl chloride (<e>PVC</e>), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and lactose samples.",M2
18508336,"Novel  anchor modification  of polymeric biomaterial surfaces by the utilization of cyclodextrin inclusion complex supramolecules.In this article, a novel approach for the surface modification of polymeric biomaterials by the utilization of supramolecules was studied. The supramolecules selected were cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (CICs). The biomaterial selected for surface modification was plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) (<e>PVC</e>-P). Results indicate that when the CICs were blended into PVC-P, they tend to migrate and  anchor  on the surface to achieve a remarkable protein-resistant surface, with improved blood compatibility. In comparison with a physical mixture of cyclodextrins and a  guest  molecule, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-poly(propylene oxide) (PPO)-PEO and PPO-PEO-PPO for PVC-P modification, CICs modified PVC-P are more consistent in processing and achieve reproducible surface characteristics. Based on this study, a novel  anchor modification  was proposed regarding CICs modified surface. This  anchor modification  is likely to reduce plasticizer extraction from PVC-P and also can be utilized for the modification of polymers other than PVC-P.",M2
