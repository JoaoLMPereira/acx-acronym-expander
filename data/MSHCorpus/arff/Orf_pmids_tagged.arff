20479244,"A viral assembly factor promotes AAV2 capsid formation in the nucleolus.The volume available in icosahedral virus capsids limits the size of viral genomes. To overcome this limitation, viruses have evolved strategies to increase their coding capacity by using more than one <e>ORF</e> while keeping the genome length constant. The assembly of virus capsids requires the coordinated interaction of a large number of subunits to generate a highly ordered structure in which the viral genome can be enclosed. To understand this process, it is essential to know which viral and nonviral components are involved in the assembly reaction. Here, we show that the adeno-associated virus (AAV) encodes a protein required for capsid formation by means of a nested, alternative ORF of the cap gene. Translation is initiated at a nonconventional translation start site, resulting in the expression of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 23 kDa. This protein, designated assembly-activating protein (AAP), is localized in the host cell nucleolus, where AAV capsid morphogenesis occurs. AAP targets newly synthesized capsid proteins to this organelle and in addition fulfils a function in the assembly reaction itself. Sequence analysis suggests that also all other species of the genus Dependovirus encode a homologous protein in their cap gene. The arrangement of different ORFs that encode capsid proteins and an assembly factor within the same mRNA facilitates a timely coordinated expression of the components involved in the assembly process.",M1
20455466,"[Study of coding sequences of variable regions in smallpox virus genome]Potential <e>ORFs</e> were sought in the extended segments of terminal variable regions in the variola virus genome. These ORFs underwent a detailed structural and functional analysis and were compared both between themselves and with homologous ORFs of various orthopoxviruses. The most conservative and heterogeneous ORFs of 70 VARV strains were detected. The unique for VARV ORF (111 a.a) was revealed for Helder and Mary strains of the Russian collection. In addition, only in the Helder strain, ORF D14L was disintegrated into two separate ORFs. A number of ambiguities were found in the current databases for VARV ORF. The dominating type of evolution was ascertained to be stabilizing selection for analyzed ORF. It has been established that VARV ORF C3L, unlike other poxviral orthologs, undergoes an adaptive selection. These findings suggest that this gene plays an important role in human VARV adaptation.",M1
20455463,"[Integration of influenza A virus NSP gene into baculovirus genome and its expression in insect cells]Segment NS in all human influenza A viruses and in the part of avian and animal ones was found to contain an additional (beside NS1 and NEP) long open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) enabling to code a polypeptide of 18-26 kD in different strains. This ORF, in contrast to the NS1 and NEP, locates in positive sense orientation in the negative polarity genomic NS RNA segment and the encoded protein is referred NSP (Negative Strand Protein). Here, the NSP gene of human influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus was inserted into genomic DNA of baculovirus (insect nuclear polyhedrosis virus) and insect H5 cells (ovary cell line of Trichoplusia ni) were infected with the obtained chimeric virus. The NSP gene appeared to express 19 kD polypeptide which was intracellularly stable and accumulated predominantly in the cytoplasm of infected H5 cells. These data indicate that the NSP gene possesses sense sequence which is able to direct a physiological synthesis of stable protein in eukaryotic cells.",M1
20427513,"Translational repression by PUF proteins in vitro.PUF (Pumilio and FBF) proteins provide a paradigm for mRNA regulatory proteins. They interact with specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs and cause changes in RNA stability or translational activity. Here we describe an in vitro translation assay that reconstitutes the translational repression activity of canonical PUF proteins. In this system, recombinant PUF proteins were added to yeast cell lysates to repress reporter mRNAs bearing the 3'UTRs of specific target mRNAs. PUF proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans were active in the assay and were specific by multiple criteria. Puf5p, a yeast PUF protein, repressed translation of four target RNAs. Repression mediated by the HO 3'UTR was particularly efficient, due to a specific sequence in that 3'UTR. The sequence lies downstream from the PUF binding site and does not affect PUF protein binding. PUF-mediated repression was sensitive to the distance between the <e>ORF</e> and the regulatory elements in the 3'UTR: excessive distance decreased repression activity. Our data demonstrate that PUF proteins function in vitro across species, that different mRNA targets are regulated differentially, and that specific ancillary sequences distinguish one yeast mRNA target from another. We suggest a model in which PUF proteins can control translation termination or elongation.",M1
20361666,"[Differentiation of geographic biovariants of smallpox virus by PCR]Comparative analysis of amino acid and nucleotides sequences of <e>ORFs</e> located in extended segments of the terminal variable regions in variola virus genome detected a promising locus for viral genotyping according to the geographic origin. This is ORF O1L of VARV. The primers were calculated for synthesis of this ORF fragment by PCR, which makes it possible to distinguish South America-Western Africa genotype from other VARV strains. Subsequent RFLP analysis reliably differentiated Asian strains from African strains (except Western Africa isolates). This method has been tested using 16 VARV strains from various geographic regions. The developed approach is simple, fast and reliable.",M1
20348260,"Negative regulation of expression of the nitrate assimilation nirA operon in the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.In the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, expression of the nitrate assimilation nirA operon takes place in the absence of ammonium and the presence of nitrate or nitrite. Several positive-action proteins that are required for expression of the nirA operon have been identified. Whereas NtcA and NtcB exert their action by direct binding to the nirA operon promoter, CnaT acts by an as yet unknown mechanism. In the genome of this cyanobacterium, open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) all0605 (the nirB gene) is found between the nirA (encoding nitrite reductase) and ntcB genes. A nirB mutant was able to grow at the expense of nitrate as a nitrogen source and showed abnormally high levels of nirA operon mRNA both in the presence and in the absence of nitrate. This mutant showed increased nitrate reductase activity but decreased nitrite reductase activity, an imbalance that resulted in excretion of nitrite, which accumulated in the extracellular medium, when the nirB mutant was grown in the presence of nitrate. A nirA in-frame deletion mutant also showed a phenotype of increased expression of the nirA operon in the absence of ammonium, independent of the presence of nitrate in the medium. Both NirB and NirA are therefore needed to keep low levels of expression of the nirA operon in the absence of an inducer. Because NirB is also needed to attain high levels of nitrite reductase activity, NirA appears to be a negative element in the nitrate regulation of expression of the nirA operon in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.",M1
20233419,"Characterization of the ovine ribosomal protein SA gene and its pseudogenes.BACKGROUND: The ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), previously named 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor/67-kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in a number of pathological processes, such as cancer and prion diseases. In all investigated species, RPSA is a member of a multicopy gene family consisting of one full length functional gene and several pseudogenes. Therefore, for studies on RPSA related pathways/pathologies, it is important to characterize the whole family and to address the possible function of the other RPSA family members. The present work aims at deciphering the RPSA family in sheep. RESULTS: In addition to the full length functional ovine RPSA gene, 11 other members of this multicopy gene family, all processed pseudogenes, were identified. Comparison between the RPSA transcript and these pseudogenes shows a large variety in sequence identities ranging from 99% to 74%. Only one of the 11 pseudogenes, i.e. RPSAP7, shares the same open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of 295 amino acids with the RPSA gene, differing in only one amino acid. All members of the RPSA family were annotated by comparative mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) localization. Transcription was investigated in the cerebrum, cerebellum, spleen, muscle, lymph node, duodenum and blood, and transcripts were detected for 6 of the 11 pseudogenes in some of these tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In the present work we have characterized the ovine RPSA family. Our results have revealed the existence of 11 ovine RPSA pseudogenes and provide new data on their structure and sequence. Such information will facilitate molecular studies of the functional RPSA gene taking into account the existence of these pseudogenes in the design of experiments. It remains to be investigated if the transcribed members are functional as regulatory non-coding RNA or as functional proteins.",M1
20228577,"Cloning of a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene and the responses of Caragana korshinskii to a variety of abiotic stresses.Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant adaptive responses to various environmental stresses. Oxidative cleavage of cis-epoxycarotenoids catalyzed by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is the main regulatory step in the biosynthesis of ABA in higher plants. Using RACE technology, a full-length cDNA-encoding NCED gene was isolated and characterized from the leaves of Caragana korshinskii (Peashrub). The 2442-bp full-length CkNCED1 had a 1818-bp <e>ORF</e>, which encodes a peptide of 605 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of CkNCED1 protein shared high identity with other NCEDs. Southern blot analysis revealed that the gene CkNCED1 was a single copy in the genome of C. korshinskii. When C. korshinskii plants were exposed to a water deficit, ABA accumulation was followed by large increases in CkNCED1 mRNA in leaves and stems, but only a moderate increase in the roots. Conversely, rehydration of stressed leaves caused a rapid decrease in CkNCED1 mRNA and ABA levels. RT-PCR and Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that salt stress rapidly induced the strong expression of CkNCED1 in leaves and roots of C. korshinskii, as well as ABA accumulation. The expression of CkNCED1 and ABA accumulation was also induced by cold stress and the application of exogenous ABA. Taken together, these results suggest that CkNCED1 likely plays a primary role in the biosynthesis of ABA in C. korshinskii.",M1
20221838,"Complete genomic sequence of a Tobacco rattle virus isolate from Michigan-grown potatoes.Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) causes stem mottle on potato leaves and necrotic arcs and rings in potato tubers, known as corky ringspot disease. Recently, TRV was reported in Michigan potato tubers cv. FL1879 exhibiting corky ringspot disease. Sequence analysis of the RNA-1-encoded 16-kDa gene of the Michigan isolate, designated MI-1, revealed homology to TRV isolates from Florida and Washington. Here, we report the complete genomic sequence of RNA-1 (6,791 nt) and RNA-2 (3,685 nt) of TRV MI-1. RNA-1 is predicted to contain four open reading frames, and the genome structure and phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-1 nucleotide sequence revealed significant homologies to the known sequences of other TRV-1 isolates. The relationships based on the full-length nucleotide sequence were different from than those based on the 16-kDa gene encoded on genomic RNA-1 and reflect sequence variation within a 20-25-aa residue region of the 16-kDa protein. MI-1 RNA-2 is predicted to contain three <e>ORFs</e>, encoding the coat protein (CP), a 37.6-kDa protein (ORF 2b), and a 33.6-kDa protein (ORF 2c). In addition, it contains a region of similarity to the 3' terminus of RNA-1, including a truncated portion of the 16-kDa cistron. Phylogenetic analysis of RNA-2, based on a comparison of nucleotide sequences with other members of the genus Tobravirus, indicates that TRV MI-1 and other North American isolates cluster as a distinct group. TRV M1-1 is only the second North American isolate for which there is a complete sequence of the genome, and it is distinct from the North American isolate TRV ORY. The relationship of the TRV MI-1 isolate to other tobravirus isolates is discussed.",M1
20209896,"[Cloning and characterization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase gene of Salvia miltiorrhia]OBJECTIVE: To obtain geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase gene of Salvia miltiorrhiza, and conduct bioinformatic and transcript expression analysis of the cloned SmGGPS1 gene. METHOD: The degenerate primers were designed based on the conservative regions of GGPS protein sequences from public databases. The target gene was obtained from root of S. miltiorrhiza by use of homologous cDNA amplification and RACE technologies. The sequence alignment was performed using BLAST. The open reading frame was identified by use of the <e>ORF</e> Finder. The protein domains were defined by use of Prosite software and the signal peptide sequence was predicted by Target P1.1. MEGA4.0 was used to conduct multiple amino acid sequence alignment and construct the phylogenetic tree. Roots and leaves at the seedlings stage and roots, stems, leaves, buds and flowers in the flowering stage were sampled for transcript analysis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the gene expression level. The complete gene of GGPS was obtained from S. miltiorrhiza genomic DNA by PCR using the cDNA-derived specific primer. The gene structure of GGPS was analyzed by comparison of the genomic DNA and its cDNA. RESULT: The obtained 1 298 bp SmGGPS1 cDNA sequence contains an 1095 bp ORF, encoding 364 amino acids. It is predicted that it has a plastid targeting signal peptide of approximately 52 amino acid at the N-terminal end. It is to believe that this is the polyprenyl synthetase signature, and nucleic acid sequence comparison revealed that SmGGPS1 ORF has more than 60% identity to the reported GGPS. RT-PCR semi-quantitative analysis showed that the gene expresses in the all tested tissues, and with much higher level of expression in the leaves in the flowering stage. SmGGPS1 has a 397 bp intron. CONCLUSION: For the first time the cloning of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase gene from S. miltiorrhiza was reported, and it provides a good basis for further functional study of SmGGPS1.",M1
20200253,"ORF157 from the archaeal virus Acidianus filamentous virus 1 defines a new class of nuclease.Acidianus filamentous virus 1 (AFV1) (Lipothrixviridae) is an enveloped filamentous virus that was characterized from a crenarchaeal host. It infects Acidianus species that thrive in the acidic hot springs (&gt;85 degrees C and pH &lt;3) of Yellowstone National Park, WY. The AFV1 20.8-kb, linear, double-stranded DNA genome encodes 40 putative open reading frames whose sequences generally show little similarity to other genes in the sequence databases. Because three-dimensional structures are more conserved than sequences and hence are more effective at revealing function, we set out to determine protein structures from putative AFV1 open reading frames (<e>ORF</e>). The crystal structure of ORF157 reveals an alpha+beta protein with a novel fold that remotely resembles the nucleotidyltransferase topology. In vitro, AFV1-157 displays a nuclease activity on linear double-stranded DNA. Alanine substitution mutations demonstrated that E86 is essential to catalysis. AFV1-157 represents a novel class of nuclease, but its exact role in vivo remains to be determined.",M1
20198877,"[Characterization of the transfer-related tra region of the conjugative plasmid p19 from a Bacillus subtilis soil strain]The nucleotide sequences of three DNA fragments (total size 30574 bp) of the plasmid p19 from the Bacillus subtilis 19 soil strain have been determined. Thirty open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) have been identified in these fragments. oriT of the plasmid has also been identified. As shown by the search for homologs of hypothetical protein products of these ORFs in databases, such homology exists for 18 ORFs. The protein products of nine ORFs can be assumed to have specific functions. Several ORFs were inactivated via insertional mutagenesis, and the conjugation capacity of the mutant plasmids was estimated. According to the data on homology of protein products and the results of ORF inactivation, regions of a total size of about 20 kb from the DNA fragments sequenced by us were inferred to belong to the tra region of p19. As follows from the analysis of the identified ORFs of the p19 tra region, it differs from the earlier described tra regions of other plasmids, irrespective of a certain similarity with the corresponding regions of plasmids of gram-positive bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Clostridium, and Listeria.",M1
20193388,"[Complete sequence of the M segment of Amur virus in rodent from China]OBJECTIVE: To study the complete sequence of M segment of Amur virus in rodents and to explore their molecular characteristics. METHODS: Complete M segment of Amur virus in rodent from China was amplified by RT-PCR. The purified PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and then sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis on multiple nucleotide sequences was performed with the Tree PUZZLE and DNAStar software. RESULTS: The full-length of its M gene comprised of 3615 nucleotides with one open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) including 3408 nucleotides and encoding a protein which comprised 1135 amino acids. The ORF was located at bases 41 to 3448. The phylogenetic analysis of JilinAP06 with other hantaviruses revealed that the complete sequence of M segment of JilinAP06 strain was closely related to those Amur viruses such as B78 strain, Liu strain and H5 strain were all from the patients. The complete sequence of M segment of JilinAP06 had only 79.5% identities with the nucleotide sequence of HTNV strain 76 - 118. CONCLUSION: The complete sequence on M segment of Amur virus in rodent was first time identified in this country.",M1
20179149,"The h subunit of eIF3 promotes reinitiation competence during translation of mRNAs harboring upstream open reading frames.Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are protein coding elements in the 5' leader of messenger RNAs. uORFs generally inhibit translation of the main <e>ORF</e> because ribosomes that perform translation elongation suffer either permanent or conditional loss of reinitiation competence. After conditional loss, reinitiation competence may be regained by, at the minimum, reacquisition of a fresh methionyl-tRNA. The conserved h subunit of Arabidopsis eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) mitigates the inhibitory effects of certain uORFs. Here, we define more precisely how this occurs, by combining gene expression data from mutated 5' leaders of Arabidopsis AtbZip11 (At4g34590) and yeast GCN4 with a computational model of translation initiation in wild-type and eif3h mutant plants. Of the four phylogenetically conserved uORFs in AtbZip11, three are inhibitory to translation, while one is anti-inhibitory. The mutation in eIF3h has no major effect on uORF start codon recognition. Instead, eIF3h supports efficient reinitiation after uORF translation. Modeling suggested that the permanent loss of reinitiation competence during uORF translation occurs at a faster rate in the mutant than in the wild type. Thus, eIF3h ensures that a fraction of uORF-translating ribosomes retain their competence to resume scanning. Experiments using the yeast GCN4 leader provided no evidence that eIF3h fosters tRNA reaquisition. Together, these results attribute a specific molecular function in translation initiation to an individual eIF3 subunit in a multicellular eukaryote.",M1
20175695,"Identification of herpes simplex virus type 1 proteins encoded within the first 1.5 kb of the latency-associated transcript.Expression of the first 1.5 kb of the latency-associated transcript (LAT) that is encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is sufficient for wild-type (wt) levels of reactivation from latency in small animal models. Peptide-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) was generated against open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) that are located within the first 1.5 kb of LAT coding sequences. Cells stably transfected with LAT or trigeminal ganglionic neurons of mice infected with a LAT expressing virus appeared to express the L2 or L8 ORF. Only L2 ORF expression was readily detected in trigeminal ganglionic neurons of latently infected mice.",M1
20167019,"Characteristics of the genome of Arsenophonus nasoniae, son-killer bacterium of the wasp Nasonia.We report the properties of a draft genome sequence of the bacterium Arsenophonus nasoniae, son-killer bacterium of Nasonia vitripennis. The genome sequence data from this study are the first for a male-killing bacterium, and represent a microorganism that is unusual compared with other sequenced symbionts, in having routine vertical and horizontal transmission, two alternating hosts, and being culturable on cell-free media. The resulting sequence totals c. 3.5 Mbp and is annotated to contain 3332 predicted open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>). Therefore, Arsenophonus represents a relatively large genome for an insect symbiont. The annotated ORF set suggests that the microbe is capable of a broad array of metabolic functions, well beyond those found for reproductive parasite genomes sequenced to date and more akin to horizontally transmitted and secondary symbionts. We also find evidence of genetic transfer from Wolbachia symbionts, and phage exchange with other gammaproteobacterial symbionts. These findings reflect the complex biology of a bacterium that is able to live, invade and survive multiple host environments while resisting immune responses.",M1
20157333,"Length of the <e>ORF</e>, position of the first AUG and the Kozak motif are important factors in potential dual-coding transcripts.A single mammalian transcript normally encodes one protein, but the transcript of GNAS (G-protein alpha-subunit) contains two reading frames and produces two structurally unrelated proteins, XLalphas and ALEX. No other confirmed GNAS-like dual-coding transcripts have been reported to date, even though many such candidate genes have been predicted by bioinformatics analysis. In this study, we constructed a series of vectors to test how two protein products were translated from a single transcript in vitro. The length of the ORF (open reading frame), position of the first AUG and the Kozak motif were found to be important factors. These factors, as well as 55-bp NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) rule, were used in a bioinformatics search for candidate dual-coding transcripts. A total of 1307, 750 and 474 two-ORF-containing transcripts were found in human, mouse and rat, respectively, of which 170, 89 and 70, respectively, were found to be potential dual-coding transcripts. Most transcripts showed low conservation among species. Interestingly, dual-coding transcripts were significantly enriched for transcripts from the zinc-finger protein family, which are usually DNA-binding proteins involved in regulation of the transcription process.",M1
20151298,"A gene controlling the number of primary rachis branches also controls the vascular bundle formation and hence is responsible to increase the harvest index and grain yield in rice.The quantitative trait locus controlling the number of primary rachis branches (PRBs) in rice was identified using backcrossed inbred lines of Sasanishiki/Habataki//Sasanishiki///Sasanishiki. The resultant gene was ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1). Habataki-genotype segregated reciprocal recombinant lines for the APO1 locus increased both the number of PRB (12-13%) and the number of grains per panicle (9-12%), which increased the grain yield per plant (5-7%). Further recombination dividing this region revealed that different alleles regulated the number of PRB and the number of grains per panicle. The PRB1 allele, which includes the APO1 open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) and the proximal promoter region, controlled only the number of PRB but not the number of grains per panicle. In contrast, the HI1 allele, which includes only the distal promoter region, increased the grain yield and harvest index in Habataki-genotype plants, nevertheless, the ORF expressed was Sasanishiki type. It also increased the number of large vascular bundles in the peduncle. APO1 expression occurred not only in developing panicles but also in the developing vascular bundle systems. In addition, Habataki plants displayed increased APO1 expression in comparison to Sasanishiki plants. It suggests that APO1 enhances the formation of vascular bundle systems which, consequently, promote carbohydrate translocation to panicles. The HI1 allele is suggested to regulate the amount of APO1 expression, and thereby control the development of vascular bundle systems. These findings may be useful to improve grain yield as well as quality through the improvement of translocation efficiency.",M1
20144949,"Rapid interactome profiling by massive sequencing.We have developed a high-throughput protein expression and interaction analysis platform that combines cDNA phage display library selection and massive gene sequencing using the 454 platform. A phage display library of open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) fragments was created from mRNA derived from different tissues. This was used to study the interaction network of the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, associated with many different pathologies. After two rounds of panning with TG2 we assayed the frequency of ORFs within the selected phage population using 454 sequencing. Ranking and analysis of more than 120,000 sequences allowed us to identify several potential interactors, which were subsequently confirmed in functional assays. Within the identified clones, three had been previously described as interacting proteins (fibronectin, SMOC1 and GSTO2), while all the others were new. When compared with standard systems, such as microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, the method described here is dramatically faster and yields far more information about the interaction under study, allowing better characterization of complex systems. For example, in the case of fibronectin, it was possible to identify the specific domains involved in the interaction.",M1
20141533,"Oxalic acid biosynthesis is encoded by an operon in Burkholderia glumae.Although the biosynthesis of oxalic acid is known to occur in a number of bacteria, the mechanism(s) regulating its production remains largely unknown. To date, there is no report on the identification of an oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway gene from bacteria. In an attempt to identify such a gene(s), a mutant screen was conducted using the simple oxalic acid-producing phytopathogenic bacterium, Burkholderia glumae. Four mutants that failed to produce oxalic acid were isolated from a transposon-mutagenized B. glumae library and named Burkholderia oxalate defective (Bod)1. DNA sequence analysis revealed that each mutant contained an insertion event at different sites in the same <e>ORF</e>, which we referred to as the oxalate biosynthetic component (obc)A locus. Complementation of the Bod1 mutant with the obcA gene, however, resulted only in a partial restoration of the oxalic acid-producing phenotype. Further complementation studies utilizing a larger DNA fragment encompassing the obcA locus coupled with deletion mutagenesis led to the identification of another ORF that we named the obcB locus, which was essential for higher levels of oxalic acid production. Transcript analysis indicated that both obcA and obcB are coexpressed and encoded on a single polycistron message.",M1
20137623,"[Molecular cloning of a novel gene, C5orf21 gene and its roles in diabetic macroangiopathy]OBJECTIVE: To clone a novel diabetic angiopathy related protein gene-C5orf21 and study its roles in diabetic macroangiopathy. METHODS: The open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of C5orf21 gene was cloned into vector from human aortic tissues by a RT-PCR-based approach and identified by enzyme-cutting and sequencing. The structure and function of C5orf21 gene and protein were further analyzed by bioinformatics technology. The mRNA expression of C5orf21 gene in human tissues and in vascular cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was used to observe the effect of high glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and free fatty acid (FFA) upon the expression of C5orf21 gene in macrophages. RESULTS: C5orf21 gene was successfully inserted into pDrive vector and identified for the first time at the level of mRNA. There are five C5orf21 gene splice variants in human aortic tissue and their length of ORF are 1251, 1113, 894, 810 and 810 bp respectively. Two kinds of splice variants have yet to be included in GenBank database. Two kinds of splice variants have the same ORF and their differences are mainly in the bases in the 5' untranslated region. Bioinformatics analysis found that C5orf21 gene was located in chromosome 5q15 and C5orf21 protein contained Arb2 domain associated with histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. C5orf21 gene was normally expressed in many tissues. Fat and aortic tissues had the highest expression. The expression of C5orf21 gene could be detected in human aortic endothelial cell, aortic smooth muscle cell and macrophages. High glucose, LDL and FFA (esp.high glucose) up-regulated the expression of C5orf21 gene in macrophage. CONCLUSION: C5orf21 gene contains five splice variants and it is identified for the first time at the level of mRNA. The changes of C5orf21 gene expression are correlated with diabetic macroangiopathy.",M1
20134075,"An approach to pathway reconstruction using whole genome metabolic models and sensitive sequence searching.Metabolic models have the potential to impact on genome annotation and on the interpretation of gene expression and other high throughput genome data. The genome of Streptomyces coelicolor genome has been sequenced and some 30% of the open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) lack any functional annotation. A recently constructed metabolic network model for S. coelicolor highlights biochemical functions which should exist to make the metabolic model complete and consistent. These include 205 reactions for which no ORF is associated. Here we combine protein functional predictions for the unannotated open reading frames in the genome with \'missing but expected\' functions inferred from the metabolic model. The approach allows function predictions to be evaluated in the context of the biochemical pathway reconstruction, and feed back iteratively into the metabolic model. We describe the approach and discuss a few illustrative examples.",M1
20091073,"Occurrence and distribution of capB in Antarctic microorganisms and study of its structure and regulation in the Antarctic biodegradative Pseudomonas sp. 30/3.The analysis of the cold-shock domain (CSD)-encoding genes, capB and cspA, by PCR amplification showed presence of capB in all 18 Antarctic Pseudomonas isolates, but the absence of cspA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of capB <e>ORF</e> from a biodegradative Pseudomonas 30/3 and its regulatory sequences including the promoter and 5'-UTR was determined and compared with the other CSD-encoding genes. Expression analysis using translational gene fusion of the putative capB promoter and its flanking sequence from Pseudomonas sp. 30/3 with lacZ' exhibited a significant increase in beta-galactosidase activity at 15 and 6 degrees C. Unlike the expression of E. coli CspA, Pseudomonas sp. 30/3 showed a slow but steady increase of the CapB expression at 6 degrees C. Subcellular localization of CapB at 6 degrees C showed accumulation in and around the nucleoid whereas at 22 or 30 degrees C, it was identified around the nucleoid as well as in the cytosol. Our study attempts to elucidate the detailed structure of capB from Pseudomonas 30/3 and the role of 5'UTR in the transcriptional regulation along with the possible role of CapB in transcription and translation suited for the cold adaptation of this bacterium in Antarctic environment.",M1
20085629,"Comparative metagenomic analysis of plasmid encoded functions in the human gut microbiome.BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the pool of mobile genetic elements associated with the human gut microbiome. In this study we employed the culture independent TRACA system to isolate novel plasmids from the human gut microbiota, and a comparative metagenomic analysis to investigate the distribution and relative abundance of functions encoded by these plasmids in the human gut microbiome. RESULTS: Novel plasmids were acquired from the human gut microbiome, and homologous nucleotide sequences with high identity (&gt;90%) to two plasmids (pTRACA10 and pTRACA22) were identified in the multiple human gut microbiomes analysed here. However, no homologous nucleotide sequences to these plasmids were identified in the murine gut or environmental metagenomes. Functions encoded by the plasmids pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 were found to be more prevalent in the human gut microbiome when compared to microbial communities from other environments. Among the most prevalent functions identified was a putative RelBE toxin-antitoxin (TA) addiction module, and subsequent analysis revealed that this was most closely related to putative TA modules from gut associated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. A broad phylogenetic distribution of RelE toxin genes was observed in gut associated bacterial species (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria), but no RelE homologues were identified in gut associated archaeal species. We also provide indirect evidence for the horizontal transfer of these genes between bacterial species belonging to disparate phylogenetic divisions, namely Gram negative Proteobacteria and Gram positive species from the Firmicutes division. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a culture independent system to capture novel plasmids from the human gut mobile metagenome, coupled with subsequent comparative metagenomic analysis, highlighted the unexpected prevalence of plasmid encoded functions in the gut microbial ecosystem. In particular the increased relative abundance and broad phylogenetic distribution was identified for a putative RelBE toxin/antitoxin addiction module, a putative phosphohydrolase/phosphoesterase, and an <e>ORF</e> of unknown function. Our analysis also indicates that some plasmids or plasmid families are present in the gut microbiomes of geographically isolated human hosts with a broad global distribution (America, Japan and Europe), and are potentially unique to the human gut microbiome. Further investigation of the plasmid population associated with the human gut is likely to provide important insights into the development, functioning and evolution of the human gut microbiota.",M1
20080976,"Stress-sensitive regulation of IFRD1 mRNA decay is mediated by an upstream open reading frame.In this report, we demonstrate that cellular stress regulates expression of IFRD1 by a post-transcriptional control mechanism. IFRD1 mRNA and protein are elevated in tunicamycin-treated human kidney epithelial cells via stabilization of the mRNA. IFRD1 mRNA instability in resting cells requires translation of an upstream open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) that represses translation of the major ORF. During stress response, the mRNA is stabilized via inhibition of translational initiation mediated by phosphorylated eIF2alpha. Translation of the major ORF of IFRD1 involves both leaky scanning at the upstream AUG codon and re-initiation at the major AUG codon and is not altered during stress. Finally, the instability mechanism depends upon UPF1, suggesting that it is related to nonsense-mediated decay. Importantly, the sequence and length of the upstream ORF are critical but do not need to code for a specific peptide. Moreover the sequence environment of the upstream ORF termination site is not an essential feature of instability. These features of decay collectively define a distinct upstream ORF-mediated instability mechanism whereby cellular stress can modulate specific gene expression through alteration of mRNA half-life.",M1
20078868,"Human coronavirus NL63 open reading frame 3 encodes a virion-incorporated N-glycosylated membrane protein.BACKGROUND: Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63) is a group 1 (alpha) coronavirus commonly associated with respiratory tract infections. In addition to known non-structural and structural proteins all coronaviruses have one or more accessory proteins whose functions are mostly unknown. Our study focuses on hCoV-NL63 open reading frame 3 (<e>ORF</e> 3) which is a highly conserved accessory protein among coronaviruses. RESULTS: In-silico analysis of the 225 amino acid sequence of hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 predicted a triple membrane-spanning protein. Expression in infected CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The protein was detected within the endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where coronavirus assembly and budding takes place. Subcellular localization studies using recombinant ORF 3 protein transfected in Huh-7 cells revealed occurrence in ERGIC, Golgi- and lysosomal compartments. By fluorescence microscopy of differently tagged envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins it was shown that ORF 3 protein colocalizes extensively with E and M within the ERGIC. Using N-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF 3 protein and an antiserum specific to the C-terminus we verified the proposed topology of an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus. By in-vitro translation analysis and subsequent endoglycosidase H digestion we showed that ORF 3 protein is N-glycosylated at the N-terminus. Analysis of purified viral particles revealed that ORF 3 protein is incorporated into virions and is therefore an additional structural protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first extensive expression analysis of a group 1 hCoV-ORF 3 protein. We give evidence that ORF 3 protein is a structural N-glycosylated and virion-incorporated protein.",M1
20069892,"[Functional genomics of Salvia militiorrhiza IV--analysis of ethylene responsive element binding protein gene]OBJECTIVE: To study the ethylene responsive element binding protein genes of Salvia miltiorrhiza through bioinformatics and characterization of its tissue expression in regenerated plantlets. METHOD: The ethylene responsive element binding protein genes were obtained by cDNA microarray analyze. BLAST was used for alignment, <e>ORF</e> finder software was used to find open reading frame, Prosite database was used to analyze the protein. Semi-quantitative RT- PCR method was used to detect the gene expression level. RESULT: One ethylene responsive element binding protein was obtained, named as SmERF. SmERF had an open reading frame of 699 bp with 5'-URT 87 bp and 3'-URT 166 bp. The putative protein SmERF contains a highly conserved ERF/AP2 domain. Semiquantitative RT- PCR illustrated that SmERF was expressed in all tissues such as root, stem and leaf in regenerated shoots, while the expression level was higher in root than in stem and leaf. CONCLUSION: It was the first time to obtain ERF gene in S. miltiorrhiza and set a good foundation for its further functional study.",M1
20063118,"Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of the isolated type I porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus from 2007 to 2008 in Korea.The first Korean strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was isolated in 1997, and it exhibited high similarity to strain VR-2332 (type II PRRSV; North American type). Recently, however, infection with type I PRRSV (European type) has also been reported in Korea. To date, preliminary data about type I PRRSV prevalence in Korea have not been reported. Here, using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we analyzed 383 archived field samples from 101 pig farms in Korea that were collected from 2007 to 2008. We identified 155 samples from 68 farms that were positive for PRRSV. Fifty-one samples (51/155; 32.9%) and 20 farms (20/68; 29.4%) were type I PRRSV-positive/type II PRRSV-negative. Furthermore, we tried to isolate the type I PRRSV from positive samples and seven type I PRRSV were isolated using PAM. The phylogenetic analysis using the type I PRRSV isolates (7 isolates) was performed based on open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>)5 (accession numbers GU325642 to GU325648) and ORF7 (accession numbers GU325635 to GU325641). In the phylogenetic study, seven type I PRRSV isolates were closely related with panEuropean based on ORF7, while they were genetically distinct from Lelystad virus and made a unique clade based on ORF5. The results of this study demonstrate that infection with type I PRRSV is not uncommon in Korean pig farms, which suggests that diagnosis and control of type I PRRSV should be considered in Korea. A new approach to vaccination against, and epidemiological analysis of, Korean PRRSV is urgently needed.",M1
20054395,"Endogenous non-retroviral RNA virus elements in mammalian genomes.Retroviruses are the only group of viruses known to have left a fossil record, in the form of endogenous proviruses, and approximately 8% of the human genome is made up of these elements. Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication, none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus. Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host.",M1
20053742,"The DR1 and DR6 first exons of human herpesvirus 6A are not required for virus replication in culture and are deleted in virus stocks that replicate well in T-cell lines.Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and HHV-6B are lymphotropic viruses which replicate in cultured activated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and in T-cell lines. Viral genomes are composed of 143-kb unique (U) sequences flanked by approximately 8- to 10-kb left and right direct repeats, DR(L) and DR(R). We have recently cloned HHV-6A (U1102) into bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors, employing DNA replicative intermediates. Surprisingly, HHV-6A BACs and their parental DNAs were found to contain short approximately 2.7-kb DRs. To test whether DR shortening occurred during passaging in CBMCs or in the SupT1 T-cell line, we compared packaged DNAs from various passages. Restriction enzymes, PCR, and sequencing analyses have shown the following. (i) Early (1992) viral preparations from CBMCs contained approximately 8-kb DRs. (ii) Viruses currently propagated in SupT1 cells contained approximately 2.7-kb DRs. (iii) The deletion spans positions 60 to 5545 in DR(L), including genes encoded by DR1 through the first exon of DR6. The pac-2-pac-1 packaging signals, the DR7 open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>), and the DR6 second exon were not deleted. (iv) The DR(R) sequence was similarly shortened by 5.4 kb. (v) The DR1 through DR6 first exon sequences were deleted from the entire HHV-6A BACs, revealing that they were not translocated into other genome locations. (vi) When virus initially cultured in CBMCs was passaged in SupT1 cells no DR shortening occurred. (vii) Viral stocks possessing short DRs replicated efficiently, revealing the plasticity of herpesvirus genomes. We conclude that the DR deletion occurred once, producing virus with advantageous growth  conquering  the population. The DR1 gene and the first DR6 exon are not required for propagation in culture.",M1
20044933,"Predicting gene function using hierarchical multi-label decision tree ensembles.BACKGROUND: S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and M. musculus are well-studied organisms in biology and the sequencing of their genomes was completed many years ago. It is still a challenge, however, to develop methods that assign biological functions to the <e>ORFs</e> in these genomes automatically. Different machine learning methods have been proposed to this end, but it remains unclear which method is to be preferred in terms of predictive performance, efficiency and usability. RESULTS: We study the use of decision tree based models for predicting the multiple functions of ORFs. First, we describe an algorithm for learning hierarchical multi-label decision trees. These can simultaneously predict all the functions of an ORF, while respecting a given hierarchy of gene functions (such as FunCat or GO). We present new results obtained with this algorithm, showing that the trees found by it exhibit clearly better predictive performance than the trees found by previously described methods. Nevertheless, the predictive performance of individual trees is lower than that of some recently proposed statistical learning methods. We show that ensembles of such trees are more accurate than single trees and are competitive with state-of-the-art statistical learning and functional linkage methods. Moreover, the ensemble method is computationally efficient and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that decision tree based methods are a state-of-the-art, efficient and easy-to-use approach to ORF function prediction.",M1
20043195,"Sequence characterization of cotton leaf curl virus from Rajasthan: phylogenetic relationship with other members of geminiviruses and detection of recombination.Diseased cotton plants showing typical leaf curl symptoms were collected from experimental plot of Agriculture Research Station-Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. Complete DNA-A component from samples taken from two areas were amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) using templiphi kit (GE Healthcare) and characterized. DNA-A of one isolate consists of 2751 nucleotides and second isolate of 2759 nucleotide. Both sequences comprised six <e>ORF</e>'s. Genome organization of DNA-A of one isolate shows high sequence similarity with other characterized local begomovirus isolates of Rajasthan, while other isolate shows high sequence similarity with CLCuV reported from Pakistan. The maximum similarity of first isolate, CLCuV-SG01, shows highest sequence identity with Cotton leaf curl Abohar (Rajasthan) virus, and second isolate, CLCuV-SG02, shows highest sequence identity with cotton leaf curl virus from Pakistan. Both isolates showed 85% similarities with each other. The sequence data revealed probable infiltration of some strains of Cotton leaf curl virus from Pakistan to India, or co-existence of different isolates under similar geographical conditions. While CLCuV-SG01 shows highest nt sequence similarity with CLCuV Rajasthan (Abohar), nt identity of V1 ORF (encoding coat protein) of SG01 shows the highest nt identity (100%) with CLCuV Multan (Bhatinda) and Abohar virus while AC1 region also showed difference. Complete nucleotide sequence of SG01 shows only 86% similarity with CLCuV Multan virus. Similarity search revealed significant difference in AV1 and AC1 regions with respect to DNA-A suggesting an evolutionary history of recombination. Computer based analysis, recombination detection Program (RDP) supports the recombination hypothesis, indicated that recombination with other begomoviruses had taken place within V1 ORF and AC1 ORF of CLCuV-SG01 and AC1 ORF of CLCuV-SG02 and also in noncoding intergenic region (IR).",M1
20040589,"Evidence for bacterial origin of heat shock RNA-1.The heat shock RNA-1 (HSR1) is a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) reported to be involved in mammalian heat shock response. HSR1 was shown to significantly stimulate the heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) trimerization and DNA binding. The hamster HSR1 sequence was reported to consist of 604 nucleotides (nt) plus a poly(A) tail and to have only a 4-nt difference with the human HSR1. In this study, we present highly convincing evidence for bacterial origin of the HSR1. No HSR1 sequence was found by exhaustive sequence similarity searches of the publicly available eukaryotic nucleotide sequence databases at the NCBI, including the expressed sequence tags, genome survey sequences, and high-throughput genomic sequences divisions of GenBank, as well as the Trace Archive database of whole genome shotgun sequences, and genome assemblies. Instead, a putative open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of HSR1 revealed strong similarity to the amino-terminal region of bacterial chloride channel proteins. Furthermore, the 5' flanking region of the putative HSR1 ORF showed similarity to the 5' upstream regions of the bacterial protein genes. We propose that the HSR1 was derived from a bacterial genome fragment either by horizontal gene transfer or by bacterial infection of the cells. The most probable source organism of the HSR1 is a species belonging to the order Burkholderiales.",M1
20033838,"Complete genome sequence of an Argentinean isolate of Solenopsis invicta virus 3.Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) is a recently described positive-strand RNA virus that infects the red imported fire ant, S. invicta. The genome of an Argentinean isolate of Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3(ArgSF )) obtained from the Santa Fe region of Argentina was sequenced in entirety. Assembly of nine overlapping fragments yielded a consensus genome sequence 10,386 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tail present on the 3' end (Genbank accession number GU017972). With the exception of the poly(A) tail, the genome length of SINV-3(ArgSF ) was identical to the North American isolate (SINV-3(USDM )). The SINV-3(ArgSF ) genome possessed three major open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) (comprised of &gt;or=100 codons) in the sense orientation; SINV-3(USDM ) possessed only two. ORFs 1 and 2 had identical start and stop genome positions for both isolates. Blastp analysis of the translated ORF 1 of SINV-3(ArgSF ) recognized conserved domains for helicase, protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These domains and their corresponding positions were identical to those reported for SINV-3(USDM ). ORF 2a, unique to the SINV-3(ArgSF ) genome, was also found in frame 2 and had a canonical start codon located at nucleotide position 8,351 and a stop codon ending at position 8,827. Blastp analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of ORF 2a revealed no significant similarity in the Genbank database. The two SINV-3 isolates exhibited 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity across the entire genome. The amino acid sequences of ORFs 1 and 2 exhibited higher identities (99.0 and 98.2%, respectively) than the corresponding nucleotide regions within the genome. These data indicated that the nucleotide differences between the SINV-3 isolates were largely synonymous. This observation was corroborated by codon substitution rate analysis. Thus, the majority of the SINV-3 codon changes were silent in the two polyproteins, indicating purifying selection pressure on the viral genome.",M1
20017924,"Evidence for a novel coding sequence overlapping the 5'-terminal approximately 90 codons of the gill-associated and yellow head okavirus envelope glycoprotein gene.The genus Okavirus (order Nidovirales) includes a number of viruses that infect crustaceans, causing major losses in the shrimp industry. These viruses have a linear positive-sense ssRNA genome of approximately 26-27 kb, encoding a large replicase polyprotein that is expressed from the genomic RNA, and several additional proteins that are expressed from a nested set of 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. In this brief report, we describe the bioinformatic discovery of a new, apparently coding, <e>ORF</e> that overlaps the 5' end of the envelope glycoprotein encoding sequence, ORF3, in the +2 reading frame. The new ORF has a strong coding signature and, in fact, is more conserved at the amino acid level than the overlapping region of ORF3. We propose that translation of the new ORF initiates at a conserved AUG codon separated by just 2 nt from the ORF3 AUG initiation codon, resulting in a novel 86 amino acid protein.",M1
20017904,"Upstream <e>ORF</e> affects MYCN translation depending on exon 1b alternative splicing.BACKGROUND: The MYCN gene is transcribed into two major mRNAs: one full-length (MYCN) and one exon 1b-spliced (MYCNDelta1b) mRNA. But nothing is known about their respective ability to translate the MYCN protein. METHODS: Plasmids were prepared to enable translation from the upstream (uORF) and major ORF of the two MYCN transcripts. Translation was studied after transfection in neuroblastoma SH-EP cell line. Impact of the upstream AUG on translation was evaluated after directed mutagenesis. Functional study with the two MYCN mRNAs was conducted by a cell viability assay. Existence of a new protein encoded by the MYCNDelta1b uORF was explored by designing a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a specific epitope of this protein. RESULTS: Both are translated, but higher levels of protein were seen with MYCNDelta1b mRNA. An upstream ORF was shown to have positive cis-regulatory activity on translation from MYCN but not from MYCNDelta1b mRNA. In transfected SH-EP neuroblastoma cells, high MYCN dosage obtained with MYCNDelta1b mRNA translation induces an antiapoptotic effect after serum deprivation that was not observed with low MYCN expression obtained with MYCN mRNA. Here, we showed that MYCNOT: MYCN Overlap Transcript, a new protein of unknown function is translated from the upstream AUG of MYCNDelta1b mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Existence of upstream ORF in MYCN transcripts leads to a new level of MYCN regulation. The resulting MYCN dosage has a weak but significant anti-apoptotic activity after intrinsic apoptosis induction.",M1

The full-length cDNA of the PfGPD gene is 1403 bp, which has an open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) encoding 370 amino acids. PfGPD is conserved with other glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes and presents a single copy in the P. farinosa genome. Transcriptional analysis revealed that PfGPD gene expression level was high after 2 h induction in a hyperosmotic environment containing 2 M NaCl and returned to normal within 6 h. These results suggest that the PfGPD gene is induced by salt stress. Yeast complementation experiment indicated that PfGPD complements gpd1 mutation in S. cerevisiae.

20012986,"Genetic and biochemical analysis of the TLA1 gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genomic DNA database contains a predicted open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>-P) without an apparent stop-codon and unknown coding sequence, located in close proximity and immediately upstream of the TLA1 gene (GenBank Accession No. AF534570). The latter was implicated in the regulation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size of photosynthesis (Tetali et al. Planta 225:813-829, 2007). To provide currently lacking information on ORF-P and its potential participation in TLA1 gene expression, thus in the regulation of the chlorophyll antenna size, genetic and biochemical analyses were undertaken. The coding and UTR regions of the ORF-P were defined and delineated from those of the adjacent TLA1 gene. ORF-P is shown to encode a protein with a distinct RING-like zinc finger domain that is present in numerous eukaryotic proteins, believed to play a role in cellular ubiquitination, leading to regulation of cellular processes like signaling, growth, transcription, and DNA repair. It is further shown that the two genes share a 74-bp overlap between the 3' UTR region of ORF-P and the 5' UTR region of TLA1. However, they possess distinct start and stop codons and separate coding sequences, and transcribed as separate mRNAs without any trans-splicing between them. Complementation experiments showed that the TLA1 gene alone is sufficient to rescue the truncated chlorophyll antenna size phenotype of the tla1 mutant. Protein sequence alignments in C. reinhardtii and the colorless microalga Polytomella parva suggested that TLA1 defines the relationship between nucleus and organelle in microalgae, indirectly affecting the development of the chlorophyll antenna size.",M1

We have reported the complete genomic sequence of TVBMV isolate YND with unique NIb/CP cleavage site. Here, we determined and analyzed the complete genomic sequence of isolate HN39, which was collected from tobacco in Henan Province and represented Chinese prevalent strain of TVBMV.

Here we report the occurrence of rearrangements of MyRV1 S4, albeit at a very low frequency, in the absence of CHV1 p29, resulting in internal 80-90% deletions of the open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) in S4. Comparative analyses of fungal strains infected by wild-type MyRV1 and its variants carrying rearrangements of S4, S4 plus S10 and S10 indicated that S4-encoded VP4, like VP10, is non-essential for virus replication but required for efficient vertical transmission and symptom expression caused by MyRV1.

19997491,"The origin recognition complex interacts with a subset of metabolic genes tightly linked to origins of replication.The origin recognition complex (ORC) marks chromosomal sites as replication origins and is essential for replication initiation. In yeast, ORC also binds to DNA elements called silencers, where its primary function is to recruit silent information regulator (SIR) proteins to establish transcriptional silencing. Indeed, silencers function poorly as chromosomal origins. Several genetic, molecular, and biochemical studies of HMR-E have led to a model proposing that when ORC becomes limiting in the cell (such as in the orc2-1 mutant) only sites that bind ORC tightly (such as HMR-E) remain fully occupied by ORC, while lower affinity sites, including many origins, lose ORC occupancy. Since HMR-E possessed a unique non-replication function, we reasoned that other tight sites might reveal novel functions for ORC on chromosomes. Therefore, we comprehensively determined ORC  affinity  genome-wide by performing an ORC ChIP-on-chip in ORC2 and orc2-1 strains. Here we describe a novel group of orc2-1-resistant ORC-interacting chromosomal sites (<e>ORF</e>-ORC sites) that did not function as replication origins or silencers. Instead, ORF-ORC sites were comprised of protein-coding regions of highly transcribed metabolic genes. In contrast to the ORC-silencer paradigm, transcriptional activation promoted ORC association with these genes. Remarkably, ORF-ORC genes were enriched in proximity to origins of replication and, in several instances, were transcriptionally regulated by these origins. Taken together, these results suggest a surprising connection among ORC, replication origins, and cellular metabolism.",M1

The C-terminal domain of SeMV polyprotein 2a was cloned, expressed and purified in order to functionally characterize it. The protein of size 8kDa (P8) domain, like viral protein genome linked (VPg), was found to be natively unfolded and could bind to nucleic acids. Interestingly, P10-P8 but not P8 showed a novel Mg(2+) dependent ATPase activity that was inhibited in the presence of poly A.

19954114,"[Mutational analysis of Meq, RLORF4, RLORF12 and 132bpr genes of epidemic Marek's disease virus strains highly passaged on chicken embryo fibroblast]Recently, much work has been devoted to study MD-induced oncogenesis and the genes involved in this process. Among many genes in the MDV genome, several genes such as Meq, RLORF4, RLORF12, and 132bpr have been considered recently associated with virulence of MDV. In this paper, primers of Meq, RLORF4, RLORF12 and 132bpr genes were designed and synthesized, based on the published whole genome sequence of MDV strain GA. The genes of Meq, RLORF4 and RLORF12 from four Chinese epidemic MDV strains highly passaged on chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), i. e. L-SYp85C, L-MSp75C, L-CZp75C, and L-ZYp75C, as well as their corresponding parent strains, i. e. L-SY, L-MS, L-CZ, and L-ZY, the reference virulent strain J-1 and the vaccine strain 814 were amplified by PCR respectively. Then the PCR products of interest were cloned and sequenced respectively. The results of sequence comparison and analysis of Meq genes in the study indicated that Meq genes from the two strains L-ZYp75C and L-CZp75C contained single nucleotide insertion and deletion. The Meq gene from strain L-ZYp75C contained an extra cytidine (C) insertion at nucleotide position 529 and a single thymidine (T) deletion at nucleotide position 602, resulting in a frameshift mutation. And this frameshift mutation could lead to changes in deduced amino acid sequence from position 177 to 200 of Meq gene. The extra C insertion at nucleotide position 625 in Meq gene of strain L-CZp75C was also predicted to cause frameshift mutation in three overlapping genes (Meq, RLORF6 and 23KD genes). The comparison of nucleotide sequences of RLORF4 genes in the study revealed that the RLORF4 gene of strain L-SYp85C contained a fragment deletion in Open Reading Frame (<e>ORF</e>) from nucleotide position 215 to 265, resulting in 17 amino acids deletions, which were not found in other sequenced strains. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of RLORF12 genes in the study revealed several mutations. The RLORF12 gene of strain L-MSp75C contained a single T deletion at nucleotide position 67 and of 814 vaccine strain a large fragment deletion from nucleotide position 18 to 86, both of the deletions located in Origin of replication site (Ori) of MDV genome. But strain L-ZYp75C possessed an unique  TGTTGGG  deletion in its RLORF12 gene. When the four Chinese epidemic MDV strains were serially passaged on CEF, the number of copies of the 132bp repeats increased from 2 to more than 10 copies.

The NSP5 and NSP6 of strain TB-Chen are encoded by the 10th gene segment (816bp in whole length) of the viral genome. The results obtained in this study showed that the NSP5 was encoded in the first open-reading-frame (<e>ORF</e>) of the gene segment (from 22bp to 624bp), and NSP6 was encoded in the second ORF (from 80bp to 355bp). The NSP5 protein consisted of 200 amino acid residues with a putative molecular mass of 21.9 kD, and a putative isoelectric point of 7.86. The NSP6 protein consisted of 92 amino acids with a putative molecular mass of 11 kD, and a putative isoelectric point of 9.65. This study further analyzed phylogenetic relationship of the NSP5/NSP6 ORF nucleotide sequence. The results showed that the NSP5s of group A rotavirus could be at least classified into 7 genotypes (H1-H7), the NSP6s could be at least classified into 8 genotypes (hl-h8); the genotypes of the NSP5 and NSP6 derived from strain TB-Chen was classified as H2 and h2. This was the first report on the genotype classification of the NSP6 of group A RVs, and it was proposed English letter  h  to represent genotype of the NSP6, e. g. strain 69M classified as H7h7, strains Wa and KU classified as H1h8.",M1
19946875,"Inhibition of 2A-mediated 'cleavage' of certain artificial polyproteins bearing N-terminal signal sequences.Where 2A oligopeptide sequences occur within <e>ORFs</e>, the formation of the glycyl-prolyl peptide bond at the C-terminus of (each) 2A does not occur. This property can be used to concatenate sequences encoding several proteins into a single ORF: each component of such an artificial polyprotein is generated as a discrete translation product. 2A and '2A-like' sequences have become widely utilised in biotechnology and biomedicine. Individual proteins may also be co- and post-translationally targeted to a variety of sub-cellular sites. In the case of polyproteins bearing N-terminal signal sequences we observed, however, that the protein downstream of 2A (no signal) was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We interpreted these data as a form of 'slipstream' translocation: downstream proteins, without signals, were translocated through a translocon pore already formed by the signal sequence at the N-terminus of the polyprotein. Here we show this effect is, in fact, due to inhibition of the 2A reaction (formation of fusion protein) by the C-terminal region (immediately upstream of 2A) of some proteins when translocated into the ER. Solutions to this problem include the use of longer 2As (with a favourable upstream context) or modifying the order of proteins comprising polyproteins.",M1
19941388,"Characterization of ORF127 of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus.It has been shown that Ha127 in the genome of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaNPV) has homologs in some other baculoviruses and encodes a putative protein of 192 aa. In this study, a sequence analysis showed the transcription initiation site in Ha127 gene at nts 188 upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG and a potential leucine zipper motif at aa 34-55 in the corresponding protein. Ha127 transcripts were detected in HaNPV-infected HzAM1 cells at 18-72 hrs post infection ( p.i.) by RT-PCR, while the corresponding protein was found at 24-72 hrs p.i. by Western blot analysis suggesting that Ha127 is a late gene product. The size of detected Ha127 protein was about 28 K, a larger value than the predicted 22.6 K indicating a post-translational modification. Immunofluorescence assay of HzAM1 cells infected with HaNPV and Ha127-EGFP expression showed that Ha127 protein was localized in the nucleus. In summary, these data suggested that Ha127 was a functional <e>ORF</e> that might play a role in the nucleus during the late or very late gene expression.",M1

19931576,"Construction of synthetic open reading frame encoding human interferon alpha 2b for high expression in Escherichia coli and characterization of its gene product.The aim of this research was to obtain recombinant human interferon alpha 2b (rhIFNalpha2b) from a synthetic open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) overexpressed in Escherichia coli. For gene assembly, oligonucleotides were designed by Thermodynamically Balanced Inside Out (TBIO) method using the published synthetic codon optimized hIFNalpha2b ORF for high expression in E. coli. The synthetic ORF was assembled by a two-step Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and cloned into a pGEM-T vector. The two-step PCR resulted in a DNA band of 522 base pairs (bp) corresponding to the size of hIFNalpha2b ORF. Fifteen recombinant pGEM-Ts were obtained and the sequencing results showed that the ORFs contained one to ten mutations with an error rate of 8.3 per kilo base. An ORF carrying one mutation was cloned into a pET32b vector and site-directed mutagenesis was performed to correct the mutation. The hIFNalpha2b ORF was overexpressed as a thioredoxin-his-tag fusion protein in E. coli BL21. The rhIFNalpha2b fusion protein was isolated from inclusion bodies (IB), renatured, and purified using Nickel columns, and all steps were monitored by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A rhIFNalpha2b fusion protein of 37kDa in size was produced in high expression levels relative to total protein, renatured and purified from IB with a yield of 3.46mg/l without any further optimization. The purified rhIFNalpha2b was confirmed by peptide analysis with nano-LC-MS/MS2 mass spectrometry. Our current research demonstrates for the first time that by using the TBIO method a synthetic ORF encoding hIFNalpha2b gene can be expressed at high levels in E. coli.",M1
19917120,"Evidence for a novel gene associated with human influenza A viruses.BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus genomes are comprised of 8 negative strand single-stranded RNA segments and are thought to encode 11 proteins, which are all translated from mRNAs complementary to the genomic strands. Although human, swine and avian influenza A viruses are very similar, cross-species infections are usually limited. However, antigenic differences are considerable and when viruses become established in a different host or if novel viruses are created by re-assortment devastating pandemics may arise. RESULTS: Examination of influenza A virus genomes from the early 20th Century revealed the association of a 167 codon <e>ORF</e> encoded by the genomic strand of segment 8 with human isolates. Close to the timing of the 1948 pseudopandemic, a mutation occurred that resulted in the extension of this ORF to 216 codons. Since 1948, this ORF has been almost totally maintained in human influenza A viruses suggesting a selectable biological function. The discovery of cytotoxic T cells responding to an epitope encoded by this ORF suggests that it is translated into protein. Evidence of several other non-traditionally translated polypeptides in influenza A virus support the translation of this genomic strand ORF. The gene product is predicted to have a signal sequence and two transmembrane domains. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the genomic strand of segment 8 of encodes a novel influenza A virus protein. The persistence and conservation of this genomic strand ORF for almost a century in human influenza A viruses provides strong evidence that it is translated into a polypeptide that enhances viral fitness in the human host. This has important consequences for the interpretation of experiments that utilize mutations in the NS1 and NEP genes of segment 8 and also for the consideration of events that may alter the spread and/or pathogenesis of swine and avian influenza A viruses in the human population.",M1
19917118,"Ribosomal protein L10 is encoded in the mitochondrial genome of many land plants and green algae.BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial genomes of plants generally encode 30-40 identified protein-coding genes and a large number of lineage-specific ORFs. The lack of wide conservation for most <e>ORFs</e> suggests they are unlikely to be functional. However, an ORF, termed orf-bryo1, was recently found to be conserved among bryophytes suggesting that it might indeed encode a functional mitochondrial protein. RESULTS: From a broad survey of land plants, we have found that the orf-bryo1 gene is also conserved in the mitochondria of vascular plants and charophycean green algae. This gene is actively transcribed and RNA edited in many flowering plants. Comparative sequence analysis and distribution of editing suggests that it encodes ribosomal protein L10 of the large subunit of the ribosome. In several lineages, such as crucifers and grasses, where the rpl10 gene has been lost from the mitochondrion, we suggest that a copy of the nucleus-encoded chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene may serve as a functional replacement. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that there are now over 20 mitochondrial genome sequences for land plants and green algae, this gene has remained unidentified and largely undetected until now because of the unlikely coincidence that most of the earlier sequences were from the few lineages that lack the intact gene. These results illustrate the power of comparative sequencing to identify novel genomic features.",M1
19907650,"Genome-scale identification method applied to find cryptic aminoglycoside resistance genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.BACKGROUND: The ability of bacteria to rapidly evolve resistance to antibiotics is a critical public health problem. Resistance leads to increased disease severity and death rates, as well as imposes pressure towards the discovery and development of new antibiotic therapies. Improving understanding of the evolution and genetic basis of resistance is a fundamental goal in the field of microbiology. RESULTS: We have applied a new genomic method, Scalar Analysis of Library Enrichments (SCALEs), to identify genomic regions that, given increased copy number, may lead to aminoglycoside resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the genome scale. We report the result of selections on highly representative genomic libraries for three different aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin). At the genome-scale, we show significant (p&lt;0.05) overlap in genes identified for each aminoglycoside evaluated. Among the genomic segments identified, we confirmed increased resistance associated with an increased copy number of several genomic regions, including the <e>ORF</e> of PA5471, recently implicated in MexXY efflux pump related aminoglycoside resistance, PA4943-PA4946 (encoding a probable GTP-binding protein, a predicted host factor I protein, a delta 2-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase, and DNA mismatch repair protein mutL), PA0960-PA0963 (encoding hypothetical proteins, a probable cold shock protein, a probable DNA-binding stress protein, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), a segment of PA4967 (encoding a topoisomerase IV subunit B), as well as a chimeric clone containing two inserts including the ORFs PA0547 and PA2326 (encoding a probable transcriptional regulator and a probable hypothetical protein, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The studies reported here demonstrate the application of new a genomic method, SCALEs, which can be used to improve understanding of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. In our demonstration studies, we identified a significant number of genomic regions that increased resistance to multiple aminoglycosides. We identified genetic regions that include open reading frames that encode for products from many functional categories, including genes related to O-antigen synthesis, DNA repair, and transcriptional and translational processes.",M1
19906358,"Cloning and functional characterisation of a fatty acyl elongase from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii).The synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), involves fatty acyl desaturase and elongase enzymes. The marine fish species southern bluefin tuna (SBT) can accumulate large quantities of omega-3 (n-3) LCPUFA in its flesh but their capacity to synthesize EPA and DHA is uncertain. A cDNA, sbtElovl5, encoding a putative fatty acyl elongase was amplified from SBT liver tissue. The cDNA included an open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) encoding 294 amino acids. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses revealed a high level of sequence conservation between sbtElovl5 and fatty acyl elongase sequences from other fish species. Heterologous expression of the sbtElovl5 ORF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that it encoded a fatty acyl elongase capable of elongating C(18/20) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, but not C(22) PUFA substrates. For the first time in an Elovl5, the substrate competition occurring in nature was investigated. Higher activity towards n-3 PUFA substrates than omega-6 (n-6) PUFA substrates was exhibited, regardless of substrate chain length. The sbtElovl5 preferentially elongated 18:4n-3 and 18:3n-6 rather than 20:5n-3 and 20:4n-6. The sbtElovl5 enzyme also elongated saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.",M1

In the present study, the cDNA and genomic sequences of IRF-5 were identified in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The cDNA of grass carp IRF-5 (gcIRF-5) contains an open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of 1560 nucleotides, encoding a putative 519 amino acid protein, which showed 34.5-83.9% identity to IRF-5 homologues from mammals, amphibian, avian and fish, and 96.2% and 95.0% identity to zebrafish IRF-5 in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and IRF association domain (IAD), respectively. The genomic DNA sequence of gcIRF-5 contains 6075bp consisting of 9 exons and 8 introns. The expression of gcIRF-5 was observed in all organs examined.

19895695,"Bioinformatic evidence for a stem-loop structure 5'-adjacent to the IGR-IRES and for an overlapping gene in the bee paralysis dicistroviruses.The family Dicistroviridae (order Picornavirales) includes species that infect insects and other arthropods. These viruses have a linear positive-sense ssRNA genome of approximately 8-10 kb, which contains two long ORFs. The 5' <e>ORF</e> encodes the nonstructural polyprotein while the 3' ORF encodes the structural polyprotein. The dicistroviruses are noteworthy for the intergenic Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IGR-IRES) that mediates efficient translation initation on the 3' ORF without the requirement for initiator Met-tRNA. Acute bee paralysis virus, Israel acute paralysis virus of bees and Kashmir bee virus form a distinct subgroup within the Dicistroviridae family. In this brief report, we describe the bioinformatic discovery of a new, apparently coding, ORF in these viruses. The ORF overlaps the 5' end of the structural polyprotein coding sequence in the +1 reading frame. We also identify a potential 14-18 bp RNA stem-loop structure 5'-adjacent to the IGR-IRES.

19890061,"The 5'-untranslated region of multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2) regulates downstream open reading frame expression through translational regulation.MRP2 (ABCC2), a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of efflux transporters that mediates the apical efflux of organic anions from hepatocytes, enterocytes, and renal epithelial cells, is postulated to undergo post-transcriptional regulation. The MRP2 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) contains seven upstream start codons and six upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Ribonuclease protection assays in human liver, placenta, kidney, small intestine, and HepG2 cells identified multiple MRP2 transcription initiation sites. We investigated MRP2 5'UTRs [-247 (-247 to -1), -204 (-204 to -1), or -99 (-99 to -1)] for their effects on regulation of gene expression with the use of transient gene expression in HepG2 cells and in vitro translation assays. In HepG2 cells transfected with SV40-MRP2-5'UTR-Luciferase cassettes, luciferase activities of constructs -247 and -204 were significantly lower than that of -99. Disruption of the uORFs at -105 and -74 nucleotides by mutation of ATGs to AAG enhanced luciferase activity significantly without affecting luciferase mRNA expression. The translation efficiencies of T7-5'UTR-Luciferase cassettes determined in vitro were consistent with transfected HepG2 cells and showed that inhibition of translation by the -105 uORF occurred only in the cis configuration and not in the trans configuration and that inhibition of translation by the -105 uORF was independent of the encoded peptide sequence. Characterization of an MRP2 polymorphism, -24C&gt;T, in the MRP2 5'UTR, demonstrated no effect on mRNA expression or downstream <e>ORF</e> translation. These data indicate for the first time that the 5'UTR of MRP2 mRNA transcripts and the uORF at -105 markedly influence MRP2 translation.",M1
19885657,"New perspective for phage display as an efficient and versatile technology of functional proteomics.Phage display with antibody libraries has been widely used with versatile applications. However, phage display with cDNA libraries is rare and inefficient. Because of uncontrollable reading frames and stop codons in cDNA repertoires, high percentage of phage clones identified from conventional cDNA libraries are non-open reading frames (non-<e>ORFs</e>) encoding unnatural short peptides with minimal implications in protein networks. Consequently, phage display has not been used as a technology of functional proteomics to elucidate protein-protein interactions like yeast two-hybrid system and mass spectrometry-based technologies. Several strategies, including C-terminal display and ORF cDNA libraries, have been explored to circumvent the technical problem. The accumulative endeavors eventually led to the efficient elucidation of a large number of tubby- and phosphatidylserine-binding proteins in recent studies by ORF phage display with minimal reading frame issue. ORF phage display inherits all the versatile applications of antibody phage display, but enables efficient identification of real endogenous proteins with efficiency, sensitivity, and accuracy comparable to other technologies of functional proteomics. Its ELISA-like procedure can be conveniently adapted by individual laboratories or fully automated for high-throughput screening. Thus, ORF phage display is an efficient, sensitive, versatile, and convenient technology of functional proteomics for elucidation of global and pathway-specific protein-protein interactions, disease mechanisms, or therapeutic targets.",M1
19841673,"Crystal structure of the N-acetylmannosamine kinase domain of GNE.BACKGROUND: UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase, GNE, is a bi-functional enzyme that plays a key role in sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, <e>ORF</e>, kinase) family. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location - dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

19840385,"Large introns in relation to alternative splicing and gene evolution: a case study of Drosophila bruno-3.BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing (AS) of maturing mRNA can generate structurally and functionally distinct transcripts from the same gene. Recent bioinformatic analyses of available genome databases inferred a positive correlation between intron length and AS. To study the interplay between intron length and AS empirically and in more detail, we analyzed the diversity of alternatively spliced transcripts (ASTs) in the Drosophila RNA-binding Bruno-3 (Bru-3) gene. This gene was known to encode thirteen exons separated by introns of diverse sizes, ranging from 71 to 41,973 nucleotides in D. melanogaster. Although Bru-3's structure is expected to be conducive to AS, only two ASTs of this gene were previously described. RESULTS: Cloning of RT-PCR products of the entire <e>ORF</e> from four species representing three diverged Drosophila lineages provided an evolutionary perspective, high sensitivity, and long-range contiguity of splice choices currently unattainable by high-throughput methods. Consequently, we identified three new exons, a new exon fragment and thirty-three previously unknown ASTs of Bru-3. All exon-skipping events in the gene were mapped to the exons surrounded by introns of at least 800 nucleotides, whereas exons split by introns of less than 250 nucleotides were always spliced contiguously in mRNA. Cases of exon loss and creation during Bru-3 evolution in Drosophila were also localized within large introns. Notably, we identified a true de novo exon gain: exon 8 was created along the lineage of the obscura group from intronic sequence between cryptic splice sites conserved among all Drosophila species surveyed. Exon 8 was included in mature mRNA by the species representing all the major branches of the obscura group. To our knowledge, the origin of exon 8 is the first documented case of exonization of intronic sequence outside vertebrates. CONCLUSION: We found that large introns can promote AS via exon-skipping and exon turnover during evolution likely due to frequent errors in their removal from maturing mRNA. Large introns could be a reservoir of genetic diversity, because they have a greater number of mutable sites than short introns. Taken together, gene structure can constrain and/or promote gene evolution.",M1
19835833,"High-throughput cloning of human liver complete open reading frames using homologous recombination in Escherichia coli.In this article, we describe a high-throughput cloning method, seamless enzyme-free cloning (SEFC), which allows one-step assembly of DNA fragments in vivo via homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. In the method, the desired open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) is amplified by use of ORF-specific primers with flanking sequences identical to the two ends of a linearized vector. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and the linearized vector are then cotransformed into E. coli cells, where the ORF is incorporated into the vector in vivo. SEFC is a simple, reliable, and inexpensive method of cloning in which PCR fragments are fused into expression vectors without unwanted amino acids or extra in vitro manipulations apart from the single PCR amplification step. Using this method, we successfully cloned human liver complete ORFs into the yeast AD and DB vectors and generated a clone resource of 4964 AD-ORFs and 4676 DB-ORFs in 3months. This approach will be useful for daily DNA cloning and for creating proteome-scale clone resources.",M1
19834620,"Adding to Yersinia enterocolitica gene pool diversity: two cryptic plasmids from a biotype 1A isolate.We report the nucleotide sequence of two novel cryptic plasmids (4357 and 14 662 base pairs) carried by a Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1A strain isolated from pork. As distinguished from most biotype 1A strains, this isolate, designated 07-04449, exhibited adherence to eukaryotic cells. The smaller plasmid pYe4449-1 carries five attributable open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) encoding the first CcdA/CcdB-like antitoxin/toxin system described for a Yersinia plasmid, a RepA-like replication initiation protein, and mobilizing factors MobA and MobC. The deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity to proteins described in Salmonella (CcdA/B), Klebsiella (RepA), and Plesiomonas (MobA/C) indicating genomic fluidity among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. One additional ORF with unknown function, termed ORF5, was identified with an ancestry distinct from the rest of the plasmid. While the C+G content of ORF5 is 38.3%, the rest of pYe4449-1 shows a C+G content of 55.7%. The C+G content of the larger plasmid pYe4449-2 (54.9%) was similar to that of pYe4449-1 (53.7%) and differed from that of the Y. enterocolitica genome (47.3%). Of the 14 ORFs identified on pYe4449-2, only six ORFs showed significant similarity to database entries. For three of these ORFs likely functions could be ascribed: a TnpR-like resolvase and a phage replication protein, localized each on a low C+G island, and DNA primase TraC. Two ORFs of pYe4449-2, ORF3 and ORF7, seem to encode secretable proteins. Epitope-tagging of ORF3 revealed protein expression at 4 degrees C but not at or above 27 degrees C suggesting adaptation to a habitat outside swine. The hypothetical protein encoded by ORF7 is the member of a novel repeat protein family sharing the DxxGN(x)(n)DxxGN motif. Our findings illustrate the exceptional gene pool diversity within the species Y. enterocolitica driven by horizontal gene transfer events.",M1
19826476,"Giardiavirus internal ribosome entry site has an apparently unique mechanism of initiating translation.Giardiavirus (GLV) utilizes an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for translation initiation in the early branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia. Unlike most of the viral IRESs among higher eukaryotes, which localize primarily within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), the GLV IRES comprises 253 nts of 5'UTR and the initial 264 nts in the open-reading-frame (<e>ORF</e>). To test if GLV IRES also functions in higher eukaryotic systems, we examined it in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and found that it functions much less efficiently than the IRES from the Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV). In contrast, both EMCV-IRES and CrPV-IRESs were inactive in transfected Giardia cells. Structure-function analysis indicated that only the stem-loop U5 from the 5'UTR and the stem-loop I plus the downstream box (Dbox) from the ORF of GLV IRES are required for limited IRES function in RRL. Edeine, a translation initiation inhibitor, did not significantly affect the function of GLV IRES in either RRL or Giardia, indicating that a pre-initiation complex is not required for GLV IRES-mediated translation initiation. However, the small ribosomal subunit purified from Giardia did not bind to GLV IRES, indicating that additional protein factors may be necessary. A member of the helicase family IBP1 and two known viral IRES binding proteins La autoantigen and SRp20 have been identified in Giardia that bind to GLV IRES in vitro. These three proteins could be involved in facilitating small ribosome recruitment for initiating translation.",M1
19812151,"Characterization of a newly identified 35-amino-acid component of the vaccinia virus entry/fusion complex conserved in all chordopoxviruses.The original annotation of the vaccinia virus (VACV) genome was limited to open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>) of at least 65 amino acids. Here, we characterized a 35-amino-acid ORF (O3L) located between ORFs O2L and I1L. ORFs similar in length to O3L were found at the same genetic locus in all vertebrate poxviruses. Although amino acid identities were low, the presence of a characteristic N-terminal hydrophobic domain strongly suggested that the other poxvirus genes were orthologs. Further studies demonstrated that the O3 protein was expressed at late times after infection and incorporated into the membrane of the mature virion. An O3L deletion mutant was barely viable, producing tiny plaques and a 3-log reduction in infectious progeny. A mutant VACV with a regulated O3L gene had a similar phenotype in the absence of inducer. There was no apparent defect in virus morphogenesis, though O3-deficient virus had low infectivity. The impairment was shown to be at the stage of virus entry, as cores were not detected in the cytoplasm after virus adsorption. Furthermore, O3-deficient virus did not induce fusion of infected cells when triggered by low pH. These characteristics are hallmarks of a group of proteins that form the entry/fusion complex (EFC). Affinity purification experiments demonstrated an association of O3 with EFC proteins. In addition, the assembly or stability of the EFC was impaired when expression of O3 was repressed. Thus, O3 is the newest recognized component of the EFC and the smallest VACV protein shown to have a function.",M1
19805230,"Rewiring the RNAs of influenza virus to prevent reassortment.Influenza viruses contain segmented, negative-strand RNA genomes. Genome segmentation facilitates reassortment between different influenza virus strains infecting the same cell. This phenomenon results in the rapid exchange of RNA segments. In this study, we have developed a method to prevent the free reassortment of influenza A virus RNAs by rewiring their packaging signals. Specific packaging signals for individual influenza virus RNA segments are located in the 5' and 3' noncoding regions as well as in the terminal regions of the <e>ORF</e> of an RNA segment. By putting the nonstructural protein (NS)-specific packaging sequences onto the ORF of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene and mutating the packaging regions in the ORF of the HA, we created a chimeric HA segment with the packaging identity of an NS gene. By the same strategy, we made an NS gene with the packaging identity of an HA segment. This rewired virus had the packaging signals for all eight influenza virus RNAs, but it lost the ability to independently reassort its HA or NS gene. A similar approach can be applied to the other influenza A virus segments to diminish their ability to form reassortant viruses.",M1
19805129,"Toggle involving cis-interfering noncoding RNAs controls variegated gene expression in yeast.The identification of specific functional roles for the numerous long noncoding (nc)RNAs found in eukaryotic transcriptomes is currently a matter of intense study amid speculation that these ncRNAs have key regulatory roles. We have identified a pair of cis-interfering ncRNAs in yeast that contribute to the control of variegated gene expression at the FLO11 locus by implementing a regulatory circuit that toggles between two stable states. These capped, polyadenylated ncRNAs are transcribed across the large intergenic region upstream of the FLO11 <e>ORF</e>. As with mammalian long intervening (li)ncRNAs, these yeast ncRNAs (ICR1 and PWR1) are themselves regulated by transcription factors (Sfl1 and Flo8) and chromatin remodelers (Rpd3L) that are key elements in phenotypic transitions in yeast. The mechanism that we describe explains the unanticipated role of a histone deacetylase complex in activating gene expression, because Rpd3L mutants force the ncRNA circuit into a state that silences the expression of the adjacent variegating gene.",M1
19804801,"Moussa virus: a new member of the Rhabdoviridae family isolated from Culex decens mosquitoes in Côte d'Ivoire.Characterization of arboviruses at the interface of pristine habitats and anthropogenic landscapes is crucial to comprehensive emergent disease surveillance and forecasting efforts. In context of a surveillance campaign in and around a West African rainforest, particles morphologically consistent with rhabdoviruses were identified in cell cultures infected with homogenates of trapped mosquitoes. RNA recovered from these cultures was used to derive the first complete genome sequence of a rhabdovirus isolated from Culex decens mosquitoes in Côte d'Ivoire, tentatively named Moussa virus (MOUV). MOUV shows the classical genome organization of rhabdoviruses, with five open reading frames (<e>ORF</e>) in a linear order. However, sequences show only limited conservation (12-33% identity at amino acid level), and ORF2 and ORF3 have no significant similarity to sequences deposited in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a potential new species with distant relationship to Tupaia and Tibrogargan virus.",M1
19801531,"Large-scale RACE approach for proactive experimental definition of C. elegans ORFeome.Although a highly accurate sequence of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome has been available for 10 years, the exact transcript structures of many of its protein-coding genes remain unsettled. Approximately two-thirds of the ORFeome has been verified reactively by amplifying and cloning computationally predicted transcript models; still a full third of the ORFeome remains experimentally unverified. To fully identify the protein-coding potential of the worm genome including transcripts that may not satisfy existing heuristics for gene prediction, we developed a computational and experimental platform adapting rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for large-scale structural transcript annotation. We interrogated 2000 unverified protein-coding genes using this platform. We obtained RACE data for approximately two-thirds of the examined transcripts and reconstructed <e>ORF</e> and transcript models for close to 1000 of these. We defined untranslated regions, identified new exons, and redefined previously annotated exons. Our results show that as much as 20% of the C. elegans genome may be incorrectly annotated. Many annotation errors could be corrected proactively with our large-scale RACE platform.",M1
19800247,"Identification and characterization of MtMTP1, a Zn transporter of CDF family, in the Medicago truncatula.Zn is an essential micronutrient in plants, and the mechanisms of Zn homeostasis are under intensive study. In this report, we have identified MtMTP1, a Zn transporter of the CDF family in the legume model plant Medicago truncatula. The <e>ORF</e> of the MtMTP1 cDNA encodes a protein consisting of 407 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa. Like other metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) in plants, heterologous expression of MtMTP1 can complement the Zn-susceptible zrc1 cot1 yeast double mutant. The expression pattern was studied by quantitative fluorescent PCR. The expression of MtMTP1 was detected in all vegetative organs with the highest level of expression observed in leaves. With Zn supplementation its expression in roots was reduced while its expression in stems was increased in the first 2 days. No obvious changes were detected in leaves. Inoculation with Rhizobium meliloti down-regulated its expression in roots.",M1
19781080,"Identification of a bacteriocin and its cognate immunity factor expressed by Moraxella catarrhalis.BACKGROUND: Bacteriocins are antimicrobial proteins and peptides ribosomally synthesized by some bacteria which can effect both intraspecies and interspecies killing. RESULTS: Moraxella catarrhalis strain E22 containing plasmid pLQ510 was shown to inhibit the growth of M. catarrhalis strain O35E. Two genes (mcbA and mcbB) in pLQ510 encoded proteins predicted to be involved in the secretion of a bacteriocin. Immediately downstream from these two genes, a very short <e>ORF</e> (mcbC) encoded a protein which had some homology to double-glycine bacteriocins produced by other bacteria. A second very short ORF (mcbI) immediately downstream from mcbC encoded a protein which had no significant similarity to other proteins in the databases. Cloning and expression of the mcbI gene in M. catarrhalis O35E indicated that this gene encoded the cognate immunity factor. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to show that the mcbA, mcbB, mcbC, and mcbI ORFs were transcriptionally linked. This four-gene cluster was subsequently shown to be present in the chromosome of several M. catarrhalis strains including O12E. Inactivation of the mcbA, mcbB, or mcbC ORFs in M. catarrhalis O12E eliminated the ability of this strain to inhibit the growth of M. catarrhalis O35E. In co-culture experiments involving a M. catarrhalis strain containing the mcbABCI locus and one which lacked this locus, the former strain became the predominant member of the culture after overnight growth in broth. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a bacteriocin and its cognate immunity factor produced by M. catarrhalis. The killing activity of the McbC protein raises the possibility that it might serve to lyse other M. catarrhalis strains that lack the mcbABCI locus, thereby making their DNA available for lateral gene transfer.",M1
19772924,"A putative endocrine factor SIBD (single insulin binding domain protein) involved in immune response of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis.Insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), characterized by the conserved insulin binding (IB) domains, are important components of endocrine system and play key roles in metabolism and growth. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of a single IB domain protein (designated EsSIBD) was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis based on expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence. The 1187 bp EsSIBD cDNA contained a 321 bp open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) encoding a putative protein of 106 amino acids, a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 189 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 677 bp. Multiple sequence alignment presented ten conserved cysteine residues critical for the fundamental structure and function of IB domain. BLAST analysis revealed that EsSIBD shared high similarity with previously known IB domains of IGFBPs with the identities ranging from 40% to 46%. The sequence similarity and domain conservation indicated that EsSIBD was a potential member of the IGFBP family. Phylogenic analysis presented that EsSIBD was closer to IGFBP7 than to the other IB domain containing proteins, suggesting its functional similarity with the endocrine factor IFGBP7. The mRNA expression of EsSIBD in different tissues including hepatopancreas, gill, gonad, muscle, heart and haemocytes, and the temporal expression in haemocytes challenged by Listonella anguillarum were measured by real-time RT-PCR. EsSIBD mRNA transcripts could be detected in all examined tissues with the highest expression level in gill. The EsSIBD mRNA expression in haemocytes was sensitive to L. anguillarum stimulation and it was up-regulated from 3 to 24 h after challenge. The structure conservation and functional similarity to IFGBPs, and its sensitivity to L. anguillarum stimulation collectively implied that EsSIBD was probably involved in endocrine and immune systems of Chinese mitten crab, and provided insight into the cross-talk between the invertebrate endocrine and immune system.",M1

The recombinant fusion protein Orf 9b was expressed by IPTG induction and purifed. After being cleaved by rEK, Orf 9b protein with MW 11 kD was separated and collected. It was demonstrated by ELISA that the purified Orf 9b protein could react with sera of SARS rehabilitaion patients but not with sera from healthy donors. CD and Infrared spectroscopy were used to predict the secondary structure of the purified Orf 9b protein. The distribution percentages for the the secondary structures of alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and random coil in the Orf 9b protein estimated by CD were 12.5%, 40%, and 47.5%, respectively, while the same parameters estimated by Infrared spectroscopy were 13.7%, 47.5%, and 37.9%, respectively. The results obtained by the two methods were substantially identical and showed that the structure of the Orf 9b protein consisted mostly of beta-sheet, and comprised only few alpha-helix. The acquisition of purified protein and the structural information presented herein may provide foundation for further functional study.",M1
19768632,"New isolates of carnation Italian ringspot virus differ from the original one by having replication-associated proteins with a typical tombusvirus-like N-terminus and by inducing peroxisome- rather than mitochondrion-derived multivesicular bodies.Five new isolates of carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) from cherry trees, Gypsophila and surface water differ from the original carnation isolate (CIRV-car) and also from Pelargonium necrotic spot virus (PelNSV) by having an <e>ORF</e> 1/ORF1-RT with a typical tombusvirus-like 5'end and by inducing the formation of peroxisome- rather than mitochondrion-derived multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This supports with natural isolates earlier conclusions reached by others with artificially produced hybrid viruses that the 5'end of ORF 1 determines from which organelle the MBVs will be derived. CIRV-car might have resulted from a natural recombination event with genome elements of a PelNSV-like virus.",M1
19756358,"Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the RNA1 and RNA2 segments of Korean Rice stripe virus isolates and comparison with those of China and Japan.Rice stripe virus (RSV) is one of the most destructive pathogens of rice plants in East Asia. The RSV genome consists of four single-stranded RNA segments. We have determined and compared the complete nucleotide sequences of the RNA1 and RNA2 segments and the deduced amino acid sequence of each <e>ORF</e> of the 13 Korean RSV isolates and established their relationships with reported RSV sequences from China and Japan. Our results showed that the average percent nucleotide divergence based on the full-length genome is higher in RNA2 (2.2%) than in RNA1 (2.0%). The average percent amino acid variation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), glycoprotein and NS2 genes encoded by viral complementary (vc) RNA1, viral RNA2 and vcRNA2, showed 2.8, 2.5 and 6.46%, respectively. On the other hand, the average percent nucleotide variation in the intergenic region (IGR) of RNA2 among the 13 Korean-RSV isolates was 3.5%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 Korean, 1 Japanese and 5 Chinese isolates based on their complete nucleotide sequences revealed two distinct types of RNA1 and three distinct types of RNA2. Most Chinese isolates grouped with one of the RNA1 types, but they were distributed among the three types when grouped by RNA2. Japanese isolate T was grouped with Korean isolates into one of the RNA1 and RNA2 genotypes. Taken together, our results suggest that the RSV population in Korea consists of mixtures of RNA1-RNA4 genome segments originating from distinctive ancestors, most likely due to either reassortment or recombination events among isolates.",M1
19756142,"Biphasic myopathic phenotype of mouse DUX, an <e>ORF</e> within conserved FSHD-related repeats.Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by contractions of D4Z4 repeats at 4q35.2 thought to induce misregulation of nearby genes, one of which, DUX4, is actually localized within each repeat. A conserved ORF (mDUX), embedded within D4Z4-like repeats, encoding a double-homeodomain protein, was recently identified on mouse chromosome 10. We show here that high level mDUX expression induces myoblast death, while low non-toxic levels block myogenic differentiation by down-regulating MyoD and Myf5. Toxicity and MyoD/Myf5 expression changes were competitively reversed by overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7, implying mechanistic similarities with the anti-myogenic activity of human DUX4. We tested the effect of mDUX expression on Xenopus development, and found that global overexpression led to abnormalities in gastrulation. When targeted unilaterally into blastomeres fated to become tail muscle in 16-cell embryos, mDUX caused markedly reduced tail myogenesis on the injected side. These novel cell and animal models highlight the myopathic nature of sequences within the FSHD-related repeat array.",M1
19753119,"Identification of nucleases and phosphatases by direct biochemical screen of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome.The availability of yeast strain collections expressing individually tagged proteins to facilitate one-step purification provides a powerful approach to identify proteins with particular biochemical activities. To identify novel exo- and endo-nucleases that might function in DNA repair, we undertook a proteomic screen making use of the movable <e>ORF</e> (MORF) library of yeast expression plasmids. This library consists of 5,854 yeast strains each expressing a unique yeast ORF fused to a tripartite tag consisting of His(6), an HA epitope, a protease 3C cleavage site, and the IgG-binding domain (ZZ) from protein A, under the control of the GAL1 promoter for inducible expression. Pools of proteins were partially purified on IgG sepharose and tested for nuclease activity using three different radiolabeled DNA substrates. Several known nucleases and phosphatases were identified, as well as two new members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, which includes phosphoglycerate mutases and phosphatases. Subsequent characterization revealed YDR051c/Det1 to be an acid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity, whereas YOR283w has a broad pH range and hydrolyzes hydrophilic phosphorylated substrates. Although no new nuclease activities were identified from this screen, we did find phosphatase activity associated with a protein of unknown function, YOR283w, and with the recently characterized protein Det1. This knowledge should guide further genetic and biochemical characterization of these proteins.",M1
19747568,"A thioredoxin response to the WSSV challenge on the Chinese white shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis.Thioredoxin (TRX) is involved in cell redox homeostasis. In addition, it is responsible for maintaining proteins in their reduced state. In our study, a Fenneropenaeus chinensis thioredoxin (FcTRX) gene was identified from the Chinese white shrimp. The full length of FcTRX was 777 bp, including a 60 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 318 bp open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) encoding a 105 amino acids protein, and a 399 bp 3' UTR. FcTRX contained a TRX domain with a conserved motif of Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (CGPC). No signal peptide was predicted by SMART analysis. The molecular mass and pI of FcTRX were 12 kDa and 4.62, respectively. FcTRX is a widely distributed gene, and its mRNA is detected in hemocytes, hearts, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine from an unchallenged shrimp. The expression level of FcTRX was the highest in hepatopancreas, where it was down-regulated to the lowest level at 12 h white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. In the gills, it went up to the highest level at 6 h. Western blot showed that FcTRX protein in hepatopancreas challenged with WSSV was down-regulated from 2 h to 12 h and then restored to the level similar to that of unchallenged shrimp at 24 h. In the gills challenged with WSSV, the FcTRX protein was up-regulated from 6 h to 24 h. Our research indicated its possible role in the anti-WSSV innate immunity of shrimps.",M1
19737457,"[Cloning and bioinformatics analysis of SLA-DR genes in Hunan Daweizi pigs]AIM: To evaluate the potential of Daweizi pigs as xenotransplantation dnors from pigs to humans by analyzing the characteristics of SLA-DR genes in Hunan Daweizi pigs. METHODS: SLA-DRA and SLA-DRB genes were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into pUCm-T vectors, sequenced and analyzed through BLAST in NCBI and related software in ExPASY. RESULTS: The SLA-DRA and SLA-DRB genes were 1 177 bp and 909 bp nucleotides in length, which contain opening reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) and encode 252 and 266 amino acids respectively. Comparing the SLA-DRA and SLA-DRB genes with their counterpart sequences of human, the homologies of amino acid sequences were 82% and 73% respectively. The amino acids in SLA DR alpha chain of Daweizi pigs from position 124 to 136, which bind to human CD4, showed only two differences with HLA DRA: a lle-Val change at position 127 and a Ser-Thr change at position 136. The amino acids in SLA DR beta chain of Daweizi pigs from position 134 to 148, which bind to human CD4, were identical with HLA-DRB. Further comparison with SLA sequences published in GenBank indicated that SLA-DRB gene found in Daweizi pigs has polymorphism while the homology of SLA-DRA gene is up to 100%. CONCLUSION: The cloned SLA-DRA and SLA-DRB in Hunan Daweizi pigs has high polymorphism with HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB in Human, indicates that Daweizi pigs have some advantages as xenotransplantation dnors from pigs to humans.",M1
19737402,"A case for a CUG-initiated coding sequence overlapping torovirus ORF1a and encoding a novel 30 kDa product.The genus Torovirus (order Nidovirales) includes a number of species that infect livestock. These viruses have a linear positive-sense ssRNA genome of approximately 25-30 kb, encoding a large polyprotein that is expressed from the genomic RNA, and several additional proteins expressed from a nested set of 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. In this brief report, we describe the bioinformatic discovery of a new, apparently coding, <e>ORF</e> that overlaps the 5' end of the polyprotein coding sequence, ORF1a, in the +2 reading frame. The new ORF has a strong coding signature and, in fact, is more conserved at the amino acid level than the overlapping region of ORF1a. We propose that the new ORF utilizes a non-AUG initiation codon--namely a conserved CUG codon in a strong Kozak context--upstream of the ORF1a AUG initiation codon, resulting in a novel 258 amino acid protein, dubbed '30K'.",M1
19737389,"Structural analysis of the full-length gene encoding a fibronectin-binding-like protein (CadF) and its adjacent genetic loci within Campylobacter lari.BACKGROUND: The combined sequences encoding a partial and putative rpsI open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>), non-coding (NC) region, a putative ORF for the Campylobacter adhesin to fibronectin-like protein (cadF), a putative Cla_0387 ORF, NC region and a partial and putative Cla_0388 ORF, were identified in 16 Campylobacter lari isolates, using two novel degenerate primer pairs. Probable consensus sequence at the -35 and -10 regions were identified in all C. lari isolates, as a promoter. RESULTS: Thus, cadF (-like) gene is highly conserved among C. lari organisms. Transcription of the cadF (-like) gene in C. lari cells in vivo was also confirmed and the transcription initiation site was determined. A peptidoglycan-associating alpha-helical motif in the C-terminal regions of some bacterial cell-surface proteins was completely conserved amongst the putative cadF (-like) ORFs from the C. lari isolates. CONCLUSION: The putative cadF (-like) ORFs from all C. lari isolates were nine amino acid larger than those from C. jejuni, and showed amino acid residues 137 -140 of FALG (50% identity), instead of the FRLS residues of the maximal fibronectin-binding activity site demonstrated within C. jejuni CadF. A neighbor joining tree constructed based on cadF (-like) gene sequence information formed a major cluster consisting of C. lari isolates, separating from the other three thermophilic campylobacters.",M1
19734337,"Cloning and characterization of an intracellular esterase from the wine-associated lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni.We report the cloning and characterization of EstB28, the first esterase to be so characterized from the wine-associated lactic acid bacterium, Oenococcus oeni. The published sequence for O. oeni strain PSU-1 was used to identify putative esterase genes and design PCR primers in order to amplify the corresponding region from strain Ooeni28, an isolate intended for inoculation of wines. In this way a 912-bp open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) encoding a putative esterase of 34.5 kDa was obtained. The amino acid sequence indicated that EstB28 is a member of family IV of lipolytic enzymes and contains the GDSAG motif common to other lactic acid bacteria. This ORF was cloned into Escherichia coli using an appropriate expression system, and the recombinant esterase was purified. Characterization of EstB28 revealed that the optimum temperature, pH, and ethanol concentration were 40 degrees C, pH 5.0, and 28% (vol/vol), respectively. EstB28 also retained marked activity under conditions relevant to winemaking (10 to 20 degrees C, pH 3.5, 14% [vol/vol] ethanol). Kinetic constants were determined for EstB28 with p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates ranging in chain length from C(2) to C(18). EstB28 exhibited greatest specificity for C(2) to C(4) pNP-linked substrates.",M1
19734331,"Mutations that disrupt either the pqq or the gdh gene of Rahnella aquatilis abolish the production of an antibacterial substance and result in reduced biological control of grapevine crown gall.Rahnella aquatilis HX2, a biocontrol agent for grapevine crown gall caused by Agrobacterium vitis, produces an antibacterial substance that inhibits the growth of A. vitis in vitro. In this study, we show that MH15 and MH16, two Tn5-induced mutants of HX2, have lost their abilities to inhibit A. vitis and have reduced biocontrol activities; they grow in logarithmic phase at a rate similar to that of the wild type and have single Tn5 insertions. They are also impaired in producing pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) or glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Complementation of MH15 and MH16 with cosmid clones of CP465 and CP104 from an HX2 DNA library restored the antibiosis, biocontrol, and PQQ or GDH production phenotypes. A 6.7-kb BamHI fragment from CP465 that fully restored the MH15-affected phenotypes was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the mutated DNA region resulted in the identification of seven open reading frames (<e>ORFs</e>), six of which share significant homology with PQQ-synthesizing genes in other bacteria, designated pqqA through pqqF. Meanwhile, A 5.5-kb PstI fragment from CP104 fully complemented the MH16 mutant and contained a single ORF highly similar to that of genes coding for GDHs. An in-frame gdh deletion mutant has the same phenotypes as the Tn5 mutant of MH16. Complementation of both deletion and Tn5 gdh mutants restored the affected phenotypes to wild-type levels. Our results suggest that an antibacterial substance plays a role in biocontrol of A. vitis by HX2.",M1
19730858,"An additional <e>ORF</e> on meloe cDNA encodes a new melanoma antigen, MELOE-2, recognized by melanoma-specific T cells in the HLA-A2 context.We characterized a new melanoma antigen derived from one of the multiple open reading frames (ORFs) of the meloe transcript. The meloe gene is overexpressed in melanomas as compared to other cancer cell lines and normal tissues. The corresponding transcript is rather unusual, in that it does not contain a long unique ORF but multiple short ORFs. We recently characterized a tumor epitope derived from a polypeptide (MELOE-1) encoded by the ORF(1230-1370) and involved in relapse prevention of melanoma patients treated with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Here we show that the ORF(285-404) encodes a polypeptide called MELOE-2 that also generated a HLA-A2 epitope recognized by a melanoma-specific T cell clone derived from the same TIL population from which we derived the MELOE-1-specific T cell clone. We also showed that HLA-A2 melanoma cells were spontaneously recognized by the MELOE-2-specific T cell clone, and we detected the presence of MELOE-2 reactive T cells in another TIL population infused to a patient who remained relapse-free after TIL treatment. These results demonstrate that translation of meloe transcript in melanoma cells can produce at least two immunogenic polypeptides, MELOE-1 and MELOE-2, from two distinct ORFs that could be relevant target for melanoma immunotherapy.",M1
19718693,"Efficient identification of tubby-binding proteins by an improved system of T7 phage display.Mutation in the tubby gene causes adult-onset obesity, progressive retinal, and cochlear degeneration with unknown mechanism. In contrast, mutations in tubby-like protein 1 (Tulp1), whose C-terminus is highly homologous to tubby, only lead to retinal degeneration. We speculate that their diverse N-terminus may define their distinct disease profile. To elucidate the binding partners of tubby, we used tubby N-terminus (tubby-N) as bait to identify unknown binding proteins with open-reading-frame (<e>ORF</e>) phage display. T7 phage display was engineered with three improvements: high-quality ORF phage display cDNA library, specific phage elution by protease cleavage, and dual phage display for sensitive high throughput screening. The new system is capable of identifying unknown bait-binding proteins in as fast as approximately 4-7 days. While phage display with conventional cDNA libraries identifies high percentage of out-of-frame unnatural short peptides, all 28 tubby-N-binding clones identified by ORF phage display were ORFs. They encode 16 proteins, including 8 nuclear proteins. Fourteen proteins were analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assay and protein pull-down assay with ten of them independently verified. Comparative binding analyses revealed several proteins binding to both tubby and Tulp1 as well as one tubby-specific binding protein. These data suggest that tubby-N is capable of interacting with multiple nuclear and cytoplasmic protein binding partners. These results demonstrated that the newly-engineered ORF phage display is a powerful technology to identify unknown protein-protein interactions.",M1
19718506,"High-throughput construction of <e>ORF</e> clones for production of the recombinant proteins.Expression-ready cDNA clones, where the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest is placed under the control of an appropriate promoter, are critical for functional characterization of the gene products. To create a resource of human gene products, we attempted to systematically convert original cDNA clones to expression-ready forms for recombinant proteins. For this purpose, we adopted a rare-cutting restriction enzyme-based system, the Flexi cloning system, to construct ORF clones. Taking advantage of the fully sequenced cDNA clones we accumulated to date, a number of sets of Flexi ORF clones in a 96-well format have been prepared. In this section, two methods for the preparation of Flexi ORF clones in a 96-well format are described. A protocol for transferring ORFs between Flexi vectors in a 96-well format is also described. We believe that the resultant clone set could be successfully used as a versatile reagent for functional characterization of human proteins.",M1
19713327,"A broadscale phylogenetic analysis of group II intron RNAs and intron-encoded reverse transcriptases.Group II introns are self-splicing RNAs that are frequently assumed to be the ancestors of spliceosomal introns. They are widely distributed in bacteria and are also found in organelles of plants, fungi, and protists. In this study, we present a broadscale phylogenetic analysis of group II introns using sequence data from both the conserved RNA structure and the intron-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT). Two similar phylogenies are estimated for the RT open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>), based on either amino acid or nucleotide sequence, whereas one phylogeny is produced for the RNA. In making these estimates, we confronted nearly all the classic challenges to phylogenetic inference, including positional saturation, base composition heterogeneity, short internodes with low support, and sensitivity to taxon sampling. Although the major lineages are well-defined, robust resolution of topology is not possible between these lineages. The approximately unbiased (AU) and Shimodaira-Hasegawa topology tests indicated that the RT ORF and RNA ribozyme data sets are in significant conflict under a variety of models, revealing the possibility of imperfect coevolution between group II introns and their intron-encoded ORFs. The high level of sequence divergence, large timescale, and limited number of alignable characters in our study are representative of many RTs and group I introns, and our results suggest that phylogenetic analyses of any of these sequences could suffer from the same sources of error and instability identified in this study.",M1
19701618,"Heterologous expression of L. major proteins in S. cerevisiae: a test of solubility, purity, and gene recoding.High level expression of many eukaryotic proteins for structural analysis is likely to require a eukaryotic host since many proteins are either insoluble or lack essential post-translational modifications when expressed in E. coli. The well-studied eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses several attributes of a good expression host: it is simple and inexpensive to culture, has proven genetic tractability, and has excellent recombinant DNA tools. We demonstrate here that this yeast exhibits three additional characteristics that are desirable in a eukaryotic expression host. First, expression in yeast significantly improves the solubility of proteins that are expressed but insoluble in E. coli. The expression and solubility of 83 Leishmania major <e>ORFs</e> were compared in S. cerevisiae and in E. coli, with the result that 42 of the 64 ORFs with good expression and poor solubility in E. coli are highly soluble in S. cerevisiae. Second, the yield and purity of heterologous proteins expressed in yeast is sufficient for structural analysis, as demonstrated with both small scale purifications of 21 highly expressed proteins and large scale purifications of 2 proteins, which yield highly homogeneous preparations. Third, protein expression can be improved by altering codon usage, based on the observation that a codon-optimized construct of one ORF yields three-fold more protein. Thus, these results provide direct verification that high level expression and purification of heterologous proteins in S. cerevisiae is feasible and likely to improve expression of proteins whose solubility in E. coli is poor.",M1
19698117,"Properties of untranslated regions of the S. cerevisiae genome.BACKGROUND: During evolution selection forces such as changing environments shape the architecture of genomes. The distribution of genes along chromosomes and the length of intragenic regions are basic genomic features known to play a major role in the regulation of gene transcription and translation. RESULTS: In this work we perform the first large scale analysis of the length distribution of untranslated regions (promoters, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, terminators) in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis shows that the length of each open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) and that of its associated regulatory and untranslated regions significantly correlate with each other. Moreover, significant correlations with other features related to gene expression and evolution (number of regulating transcription factors, mRNA and protein abundance, evolutionary rate, etc) were observed. Furthermore, the function of genes seems to have an important role in the evolution of these lengths. Notably, genes that are related to RNA metabolism tend to have shorter untranslated regions and thus tend to be closer to their neighbouring genes while genes coding for cell wall proteins tend to be isolated in the genome. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that genome architecture has a significant role in regulating gene expression, and in shaping the characteristics and functionality of proteins.",M1

In this study, we investigated the functions and the target genes of microRNA124a (miR124a), and imaged the miR124a-mediated repression of chromosome 14 open reading frame24 (c14orf24, unknown function) during neurogenesis, using noninvasive luciferase systems. The expression and functions of miR124a were investigated in neuronal differentiation of P19 cells (P19 is a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line) by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR. The predicted target genes of miR124a were found by searching a bioinformatics database and confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Remarkable repression of c14orf24 by miR124a was detected during neurogenesis, and was imaged using in vitro and in vivo luciferase systems. The expression of miR124a was highly upregulated during neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of miR124a in P19 cells resulted in a preneuronal gene expression pattern. MicroRNA124a-mediated repression of c14orf24 was successfully monitored during neuronal differentiation. Also, c14orf24 showed molecular biological characteristics as follows: dominant expression in the cytoplasm; a high level of expression in proliferating cells; and gradually decreased expression during neurogenesis.

19659802,"Unique alternative translation from two open reading frames on Acpin1 mRNA yields an acrosomal protein and a salivary-gland-specific protein.OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression profiles of the proteins translated from Acpin1 mRNA in germ cells. METHODS: Northern and western blotting of various tissues and immunohistochemical analysis of germ cells were carried out in a mouse model. RESULTS: ACPIN1 protein was transcribed from the longer, 3' open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of Acpin1. An alternative-splicing variant, Acpin1vs, contained only the smaller, 5' ORF of the full-length Acpin1 gene. Its gene product, SAGSIN1, was expressed specifically in salivary glands. Retrotransposed regions of Acpin1 homology were also detected in various chromosomes, and intronless paralogous genes on the X chromosome were expressed in the testis and other tissues. The genomic structure of Acpin1 is highly conserved in mammals. CONCLUSION: The two ORFs on the Acpin1 mRNA are independently translated in differentiated cells. Analysis of gene Acpin1 might clarify the molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis.",M1
19656965,"Novel virus-associated proteins encoded by UL112-113 of human cytomegalovirus.Evidence suggests that the products of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL112-113 genes are involved in viral DNA replication during lytic infection. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the UL112 open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) to characterize its function in detail. Immunoblots utilizing the UL112 antibody identified seven distinct protein bands (p20, p26, p28, p34, p43, p50 and p84) expressed during the HCMV infectious cycle. After screening a cDNA library constructed from cells 72 h after infection with HCMV, only four different cDNA protein-producing constructs were obtained, and their ORFs corresponded to p34, p43, p50 and p84. The proteins p20, p26 and p28 were further shown to be selectively included within mature HCMV particles, virions, non-infectious enveloped particles and dense bodies. Immunoaffinity protein purification was used to prepare the samples for liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed that p20, p26 and p28 were derived from the UL112 ORF, most likely through post-translational proteolytic cleavage.",M1
19653106,"Plant upstream <e>ORFs</e> can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in a size-dependent manner.Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a quality control mechanism that identifies and degrades aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTC). NMD also regulates the expression of many wild-type genes. In plants, NMD identifies a stop codon as a PTC and initiates the rapid degradation of the transcript if the 3'untranslated region (UTR) is unusually long or if it harbors an intron. Approximately 20% of plant transcripts have an upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5'UTR. In theory, if a uORF is translated, the 3'UTR downstream of the uORF will be long and harbor introns, thus these transcripts might be degraded by NMD. Therefore, if uORFs can trigger NMD, uORF containing transcripts would be a major group of NMD regulated wild-type plant mRNAs. The aim of this study was to clarify whether plant uORFs could activate NMD. Here we demonstrate that plant uORFs induce NMD in a size-dependent manner, a 50 amino acid (aa) long uORF triggered NMD efficiently, whereas similar but shorter (31 and 15 aa long) uORFs failed to activate NMD response. We have found that only ~2% of annotated Arabidopsis genes contain a first uORF that is longer than 35 aa, thus we propose that NMD regulates only a small fraction of uORF containing transcripts. However, as mRNAs having uORF that is longer than the critical size are strongly overrepresented within the up-regulated transcripts of NMD deficient plants, it is likely that this subset of natural NMD targets induces NMD because of containing a relatively long translatable uORF.",M1

19651242,"Glutathione S-transferase as a biomarker in the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica after exposure to the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254.Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes involved in cellular detoxification that catalyze the attachment of electrophilic substrates to glutathione. Two classes of GSTs related to the rho and sigma classes of enzymes in Antarctic bivalves have been cloned from Laternula elliptica. The full-length cDNA of rho class GST (leGSTr) is 1530bp in length and contains an open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>) of 672bp encoding 223 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of this gene have 41% and 40% identity to rho class GSTs from Ctenopharyngodon idella and Pleuronectes platessa, respectively. The sigma class GST (leGSTs) cDNA, however, is 1127bp in length and contains an ORF of 696bp encoding 231 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences share only 22% identity with sigma class GST from Xenopus laevis. The transcriptional expression of leGSTr, leGSTs, and leGSTp cloned in our previous study were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction in response to exposure to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture. The expressions of these three GST transcripts were rapidly upregulated, although they showed different expression levels and patterns within each isoform. Moreover, leGSTs was the most upregulated in the gill and digestive gland in response to PCB exposure. The recombinant GSTs were highly expressed in transformed Escherichia coli, and their kinetic properties were studied with various substrates. As a result, the three classes of GSTs were found to have diverse biological functions and were responsible for different enzymatic features.",M1
19649247,"The random nature of genome architecture: predicting open reading frame distributions.BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the size and abundance of open reading frames (<e>ORFS</e>) in whole genomes may shed light on the factors that control genome complexity. Here we examine the statistical distributions of open reading frames (i.e. distribution of start and stop codons) in the fully sequenced genomes of 297 prokaryotes, and 14 eukaryotes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By fitting mixture models to data from whole genome sequences we show that the size-frequency distributions for ORFS are strikingly similar across prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, we show that i) a large fraction (60-80%) of ORF size-frequency distributions can be predicted a priori with a stochastic assembly model based on GC content, and that (ii) size-frequency distributions of the remaining  non-random  ORFs are well-fitted by log-normal or gamma distributions, and similar to the size distributions of annotated proteins.

19647515,"Translation initiation from the ribosomal A site or the P site, dependent on the conformation of RNA pseudoknot I in dicistrovirus RNAs.Translation initiation of the second <e>ORF</e> of insect dicistrovirus RNA depends on an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in its intergenic region (IGR) and is exceptional in using a codon other than AUG and in not using the canonical initiator methionine tRNA. Studies in vitro suggest that pseudoknot I (PKI) immediately preceding the initiation codon occupies the ribosomal P site and that an elongator tRNA initiates translation from the ribosomal A site. Using dicistronic reporters carrying mutations in the initiation codon of the second ORF and mutant elongator or initiator tRNAs capable of reading these codons, we provide direct evidence for initiation from the A site in mammalian cells and, under certain conditions, also from the P site. Initiation from the A but not the P site requires PKI. Thus, PKI structure may be dynamic, and optimal IGR IRES-mediated translation of dicistroviral RNAs may require trans-acting factors to stabilize PKI.",M1
19647052,"Molecular characterization and expression pattern of the equine lactate dehydrogenase A and B genes.The species-specific properties of LDH isozymes are essentially determined by M (muscle) and H (heart) subunit proteins encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, respectively. In the present study, we molecularly characterized the full-length equine lactate dehydrogenase A (eLDHA) and B (eLDHB) cDNAs. The eLDHA cDNA consisted of a 999-bp open reading frame (<e>ORF</e>), while the eLDHB and newly acquired bat LDHB consisted of a 1002-bp ORF, which is 3 bp shorter than the LDHB ORF of other registered mammals. The alignment of amino acid sequences showed that eLDHA acquired positively charged His 88 and 226, and eLDHB lost negatively charged Glu 14, as compared to the highly conserved residues at these positions in the corresponding amino acid sequences of other mammals. These alterations were identified in six equine species by genomic DNA analysis. A comparison of the equine and human 3D structures revealed that the substituted His 88 and 226 of the eLDHA monomer and the deleted Glu 14 of the eLDHB monomer altered the surface charge of equine LDH tetramers and that these three residues were located in important regions affecting the catalytic kinetics. Also, RT-PCR amplification of the three myosin heavy chain isoforms corroborated that the cervical muscle as postural muscle of the thoroughbred horse was composed of more oxidative myofibers than the dynamic muscle. Based on this property, the mRNA expression patterns of eLDHA, eLDHB, and eGAPDH in various tissues were analyzed by using real-time PCR. The expression levels of these three genes in the cervical muscle were not always relatively higher than in the brain or heart.",M1

The lesions were multi-focal and so serious that they prevented the infected goats from seeing, eating, lactating or walking. The virus was isolated in Vero cell culture and a scab suspension was used to experimentally infect susceptible goats.

20147406,"A novel inhibitor of the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway encoded by the parapoxvirus <e>orf</e> virus.The parapoxvirus orf virus (ORFV) is a pathogen of sheep and goats that has been used as a preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory agent in several animal species. However, the functions (genes, proteins, and mechanisms of action) evolved by ORFV to modulate and manipulate immune responses are poorly understood. Here, the novel ORFV protein ORFV024 was shown to inhibit activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, an important modulator of early immune responses against viral infections. Infection of primary ovine cells with an ORFV024 deletion mutant virus resulted in a marked increase in expression of NF-kappaB-regulated chemokines and other proinflammatory host genes. Expression of ORFV024 in cell cultures significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene expression. Further, ORFV024 expression decreased TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65, phosphorylation, and degradation of IkappaBalpha, and phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) subunits IKKalpha and IKKbeta, indicating that ORFV024 functions by inhibiting activation of IKKs, the bottleneck for most NF-kappaB activating stimuli. Although ORFV024 interferes with activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, its deletion from the OV-IA82 genome had no significant effect on disease severity, progression, and time to resolution in sheep, indicating that ORFV024 is not essential for virus virulence in the natural host. This represents the first description of a NF-kappaB inhibitor encoded by a parapoxvirus.",M2
19927769,"[<e>Orf</e> of the hand]INTRODUCTION: The orf is a zoonotic infection which can be transmitted to humans. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our report is to describe this often misdiagnosed viral infection in a man with an orf of the hand appearing after the feast of the sacrifice. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man with no past medical history, presented with a nodular lesion on the fifth right finger evolving for 3 weeks which had appeared 2 weeks after the feast of the sacrifice. Histology showed a vacuolar degeneration of keratinocytes probably of viral origin. Both histological aspect and the contact with sheep, led to the diagnosis of hand orf. Three weeks later the lesion had spontaneously resolved. CONCLUSION: Orf is an infectious mucocutaneous disease due to a parapoxvirus. It is more frequent in professionally exposed persons (veterinary, butchers...). But, in our country, the frequency of the orf increases after the feast of the sacrifice and remains undiagnosed because patients do not consult. The diagnosis may be confirmed by electron microscopy, conventional histopathology or by isolation of the virus by PCR. Information on the benign character of the disease and reassurance of the infected patient are very important because lesion usually resolves spontaneously.",M2

19735227,"<e>Orf</e>: an update on current research and future perspectives.Orf is one of the most widespread viral diseases worldwide, affecting mostly small ruminants and, sometimes, other species, including wild animals. Of late, there have been an increasing number of reports of new species being affected by the disease, implying a dynamic host-pathogen interaction. The causative agent, orf virus, has been extensively investigated over recent years, owing to its zoonotic importance and ability to cross-infect other species sporadically. The evasive mechanisms that the virus has developed to adapt and grow in the presence of an active immune response helps to explain the ability of the virus to repeatedly reinfect the same host. The apparent diversity in the antigenic/immune targets of different orf virus strains involved in such repeat infections may also be contributing factors. Exposure of animals to stress or immunosupression as a result of therapy or primary viral infection can accentuate the severity of disease. Genes homologous to host cytokines or their antagonists, and which contribute to viral virulence, have been found in the viral genome. A combination of electron microscopy, histology and PCR is the most accurate laboratory approach for confirmation of the disease, although clinical signs are often typical. However, some infections may be confounded by similar clinical manifestations caused by other infections. This review presents, in brief, a recent understanding of the virus at the host-pathogen level, molecular biology of the virus, disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations in man and animals, diagnostic procedures, and the economic and environmental impact of the disease.",M2

A 35-year-old veterinarian presented with a generalized rash of large umbilicated vesicles that appeared after antibiotic treatment for erysipelas on the forearm. The erysipelas arose from an erupted pustular thumb lesion that appeared after examining a sheep. An outbreak of chickenpox in the village suggested parapoxvirus or varicella zoster virus (VZV) was the most likely agent. No poxvirus was detected by electron microscopy or in cell cultures from lesion material. PCR revealed parapoxvirus DNA with a sequence similar to <e>orf</e>-viruses from Finland. Orf-virus immunofluorescence showed a titre increase, supporting the parapoxvirus diagnosis. VZV was not detected by PCR, but varicella antibodies increased three-fold in serum samples drawn two weeks apart. In addition, the patient had high antibody titres for measles and reported recent contact with individuals exposed to an outbreak of measles in nearby Austria. To explain the unusually generalized symptoms in this young and healthy patient, these findings could be variously interpreted as: i) a booster by community VZV infections; ii) a subclinical VZV (re)infection that was superinfected by the parapoxvirus; iii) an orf-virus mediated immune stimulation; iv) a post-infectious syndrome; or v) a temporary immunosuppression by subclinical measles.",M2

The product, i.e., a water suspension of sucralfate (15% w/w) and cidofovir (1% w/w), combines the potent antiviral activity of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate cidofovir ((S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine) and the wound healing properties of sucralfate gel (sucrose octasulphate basic aluminum salt). The product was characterized in vitro with respect to compatibility between drug and carrier, spray particle size, spray deposition, drying kinetics, and drug content and release. An interaction between the two active substances was found. The interaction between sucralfate and cidofovir was counteracted by introducing sodium dihydrogen phosphate (16% w/w) in the preparation.

Rare associations with papulovesicular eruptions, including a bullous pemphigoid-like eruption, have also been described. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to clinically, histologically, and immunologically characterize two cases of orf-induced blistering disease, and to determine whether this condition represented a novel disease entity distinct from known immunobullous diseases. METHODS: Two patients were clinically described and skin biopsy specimens were collected for routine histology, direct immunofluorescence studies, and polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect orf viral DNA. Patients' sera were assessed for autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence studies using normal-appearing human salt-split skin, by Western blot analysis using keratinocyte extracts, dermal extracts, and recombinant type VII collagen, and immunoprecipitation studies of extracts from biosynthetically radiolabeled human keratinocytes. RESULTS: Two distinctive cases of severe, diffuse blistering eruptions after orf infection are described. In one patient, orf virus DNA was detected in the inciting orf lesion, but not in blistered skin, ruling out disseminated orf infection as a cause of the blisters. In both cases, histology revealed subepidermal blisters with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates containing neutrophils and eosinophils, direct immunofluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated IgG and C3 deposited at the dermoepidermal junctions of perilesional skin, and indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated circulating antibasement membrane IgG that bound the dermal side of salt-split skin. Extensive immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies failed to reveal a consistent, identifiable autoantigen. LIMITATIONS: We describe only two cases. The autoantigen recognized by circulating autoantibodies was not identified.

Six musk oxen were subjected to necropsy, histopathological and microbiological examinations. All euthanized animals had lesions consistent with contagious ecthyma presenting as wart-like, scabby lesions on the muzzle, lips, oral mucosa and limbs to a variable extent. The histopathological examination showed pustular dermatitis characterized by epidermal proliferation, reticular degeneration, degenerating keratinocytes with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, vesicopustules, microabscesses and multifocal ulcerations in the epidermis which was covered by a serocellular crust. Pathology and bacteriology showed evidence of secondary infections in the skin and draining lymph nodes. Electron microscopy (negative staining) of lesions from four animals detected parapoxvirus with the typical arrangement of the outer protein filaments. Parapoxvirus DNA was detected in tissue samples from two examined animals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers from the B2L-gene. A DNA sequence of 326 nucleotides from the amplicon was compared with similar DNA sequences from parapoxvirus isolated from sheep, reindeer, musk ox and cattle.

Thus, the vorfIL-10ko virus was attenuated compared with the vorfIL-10 intact viruses, demonstrating that orf virus IL-10 is a virulence factor. The virus IL-10 is one of several virulence or immuno-modulatory factors expressed by orf virus. Removal of any one of these genes would be expected to have only a partial effect on virulence, which is what was observed in this study with vorfIL-10.",M2

The VEGF genes of different strains of orf virus can vary extensively in amino acid sequence. Functional analyses of two major variant VEGF proteins derived from orf virus strains, NZ2 and NZ7, have revealed quantitative differences in biological activities and receptor binding specificities suggesting that these viral VEGFs could have different roles in the pathology of orf virus infection. In this study, we show that both orf virus strains express equivalent levels of the viral VEGF variants and during infection of sheep skin induce comparable levels of vascularization, edema, epidermal rete ridge and scab formation. Recombinants of orf virus NZ2 and NZ7 strains in which the variant VEGF genes were disrupted showed markedly reduced vascular changes and evidence of partially attenuated viral growth. These results demonstrate that despite substantial differences in sequence and biological activity in vitro, these virally expressed virulence factors are functionally equivalent in their natural host, contributing equally to orf virus pathology.",M2

This is providing novel and interesting data on the viral mechanism of skin infection and the host response. RECENT FINDINGS: The full genome sequences of two parapoxviruses (orf virus and bovine papular stomatitis virus) have recently been published, defining the parapoxvirus genus at the molecular genetic level. This, along with more detailed characterization of viral immuno-modulatory proteins, is providing an insight into the acquisition of host genes and the mechanism of pathogenesis. A new chemokine-binding protein has been discovered with unique features. Structure-function analysis of the viral granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitory factor has revealed a similarity to type 1 cytokine receptors. The viral vascular endothelial growth factor-E stimulates angiogenesis in the skin without the side effects seen with cellular vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and may have therapeutic potential. Finally, orf virus is proving useful both as an immuno-modulator and as a vector for the expression of foreign antigens in non-permissive species. SUMMARY: Orf virus infection provokes a vigorous skin immune response. However, the virus has acquired a range of immuno-modulatory/pathogenesis-related genes that function to limit (at least transiently) the effectiveness of host immunity. With the advent of the orf virus genome sequence, the study of this dynamic process will provide important insights into virus pathogenesis and the host skin immune response to infection.",M2

Human orf infections appear as ulcerative skin lesions after contact with an infected animal or contaminated fomite. This report summarizes the epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of four sporadic cases of human orf infection, emphasizing the temporal association between human lesions and skin trauma or recent flock vaccination with live orf vaccine. This zoonotic infection shares clinical manifestations and exposure risks with other, potentially life-threatening zoonoses (e.g., cutaneous anthrax) and is likely under-recognized because of a lack of clinical suspicion and widely available diagnostics.

However, it may be accompanied by local symptoms including pain, pruritus, lymphangitis and axillary adenitis, or less frequently by systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. Furthermore, it may be complicated by erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erysipelas, generalized mucocutaneous eruption, toxic erythema, eyelid oedema and giant, persistent or recurrent lesions in immunocompromised patients. Imiquimod, a potent topical immune response modifier, enhances both the innate and acquired immunity by stimulation of immune system cells resulting in local antiviral, antitumour and immunoregulatory activity. We present, for the first time, four complicated cases of orf successfully treated by topical imiquimod resulting in rapid regression of both orf and associated lesions.

A probable explanation for the proliferative and highly vascularized nature of the lesions was found in the expression of the VEGF-E gene encoded by the orf virus. To investigate a possible role of the viral VEGF in the pathogenesis of severe persistent orf virus lesions, the activity of four VEGF-E variants was compared by an angiogenesis in vitro model. Similar angiogenic activity was found between strains isolated from the classical and the proliferative forms of the disease, even if the latter was able to develop a higher number of vessels during the first 24 h of infection. Our in vitro findings seems to exclude that the VEGF variants encoded by the strain isolated from the atypical form of the disease could be the responsible for the histopathological aspect of the proliferative lesions.",M2

16143041,"Characterisation of parapoxviruses isolated from Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus).BACKGROUND: Two outbreaks of the disease contagious ecthyma were reported in 1999 and 2000 in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). Contagious ecthyma is an epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which is caused by the zoonotic parapoxvirus <e>orf</e> virus. Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B2L) revealed typical parapoxvirus particles and partial gene sequences corresponding to parapoxvirus, respectively. If contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by orf virus, the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the parapoxvirus genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway. RESULTS: Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ2) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known orf virus strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different isolates and compared with corresponding parapoxvirus genebank sequences. The comparison/alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses to the species orf virus. CONCLUSION: The results of this work imply that the parapoxvirus causing contagious ecthyma in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species orf virus and that the orf virus crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer.",M2

CD4(+) T cells, IFN-gamma and to a lesser extent CD8(+) T cells are involved in partial protection against infection. In spite of this, orf virus can repeatedly infect sheep albeit with reduced lesion size and time to resolution compared to primary infection. This is due at least in part to the action of virus immuno-modulator proteins that interfere with host immune and inflammatory responses. These include: an interferon resistance protein; a viral orthologue of mammalian IL-10 (vIL-10) that is an anti-inflammatory cytokine; and a novel inhibitor of the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-2 (GIF).

11744431,"Polymerase chain reaction for laboratory diagnosis of <e>orf</e> virus infections.BACKGROUND: The orf virus of sheep and goats is one of several zoonotic parapoxviruses. In the ovine/caprine host it causes contagious ecthyma (contagious pustular dermatitis, scabby mouth), but in humans it normally causes solitary or clustered orf lesions, typically on hands, arms or face. In addition to disease in the animals, the virus can be quite a nuisance as an occupational hazard in farmers and butchers. Clinical diagnosis is often possible, but laboratory diagnosis is sometimes necessary. For virus isolation, primary ovine or bovine cells, not routinely present, are needed. Serological methods exist, but electron microscopy is the most commonly used method. OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of orf zoonoses, without virus culture and without access to an electron microscope. STUDY DESIGN: A suitable primer pair was designed for orf polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the Oligo software and sequence information from GenBank. Orf positive controls and specimens were kindly provided by several public health centers. Molluscum contagiosum specimens were provided by a dermatologist. HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV positive swab specimens came from our routine diagnostic service. Asymptomatic skin specimens were obtained from sheep heads from the abattoir, and swab specimens from the heads of asymptomatic sheep. Selected amplified orf PCR positive specimens were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the PCR products. Orf positive specimens were sent to another laboratory for electron microscopy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A robust PCR was developed, with very small inter-run variation. All specificity demands were met, and the sensitivity seems to be good or excellent. All negative specificity controls from cell cultures and non-orf viruses were negative. Twenty-two (95.7%) of 23 scab or swab specimens with suspected orf etiology were orf PCR positive. Five of eight skin specimens from sheep heads from the abattoir were positive, and all 11 swab specimens from asymptomatic sheep were negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated orf-like particles in orf-PCR positive specimens.

The host response in the skin was characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and T19+ gammadelta T cells. The magnitude of this accumulation paralleled orf virus replication in the skin. In situ hybridization was used to detect cells expressing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNAs in orf skin. Cells expressing IL-4 mRNA were not detected at any time after infection. Cells expressing IFN-gamma mRNA were detected after reinfection but not after primary infection. Cells expressing TNF-alpha mRNA included epidermal cells, vascular endothelium and uncharacterized cells that increased more rapidly in the skin after reinfection compared to primary infection.

In order to replicate, the viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit key host anti-virus responses that include apoptosis, interferon production, chemokine production, inflammatory cytokine production, and the activity of cytotoxic T-cells, natural killer cells and antibody. In addition, some of the viruses encode cytokine or chemokine homologues that recruit or expand cell numbers for infection or that subvert the host cellular response from a protective response to a benign one. The specificity of the viral immunomodulatory molecules reflects the life cycle and the pathogenesis of the viruses. Herpesviruses achieve latency in host cells by inducing cell survival and protecting infected cells from immune recognition. This involves interference with cell signal transduction pathways. Many of the viral immunomodulatory proteins are homologues of host proteins that appear to have been pirated from the host and reassorted in the virus genomes. Some of these have unique functions and indicate novel or important aspects of both viral pathogenesis and host immunity to viruses. The specific example of <e>orf</e> virus infection of sheep is described.",M2
11590339,"[<e>Orf</e> in urban surroundings and religious practices: a study over a 3-year period]BACKGROUND: Orf is a sheep disease, due to a parapox virus. Men in close contact with these animals may be contaminated. This generally occurs during professional activities. In our clinic, located in the heart of Brussels, we were surprised by the number of orf cases encountered each year, grouped during a short three-week period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We decided to set up a prospective study of three years. Forty-four cases (14 to 64 years of age) were observed: 14 in 1998, 18 in 1999 and 12 in 2000. There were 29 men and 15 women. RESULTS: Only one patient had professional contact with sheep; 42 were muslims. Forty-two lesions out of 44 developed in the same time span, 10 days earlier each year. Complications observed were: erythema multiforme (7 cases), lymphangitis (3 cases), axillary adenitis (3 cases), eyelid edema (2 cases), generalized maculopapular eruption (2 cases) and contact dermatitis to the cream applied (1 case). DISCUSSION: This peculiar epidemiology can easily be explained: patients are contaminated during a religious feast, Aid el Kebir (the Feast of Sacrifice). On this occasion, they slaughter sheep, which they manipulate with bare hands. Small trauma often occur at that time. We conclude that orf is not only a professional disease but particuliar habits may cause epidemic-type contamination.",M2

The aim of this study is to compare the treatment period of the misdiagnosed surgically treated (Group 1) group and conservatively treated group (Group 2). Lesions were aggravated and delayed healing was observed in Group 1. Diagnosis of Orf disease may sometimes be difficult because of concominant bacterial superinfections and surgical trauma. Careful history and clinical findings point to the correct diagnosis. Contrary to other infections of the hand, surgery can cause further complications in this disease.

11044114,"Viral vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role in <e>orf</e> virus infection.Infection by the parapoxvirus orf virus causes proliferative skin lesions in which extensive capillary proliferation and dilation are prominent histological features. This infective phenotype may be linked to a unique virus-encoded factor, a distinctive new member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of molecules. We constructed a recombinant orf virus in which the VEGF-like gene was disrupted and show that inactivation of this gene resulted in the loss of three VEGF activities expressed by the parent virus: mitogenesis of vascular endothelial cells, induction of vascular permeability, and activation of VEGF receptor 2. We used the recombinant orf virus to assess the contribution of the viral VEGF to the vascular response seen during orf virus infection of skin. Our results demonstrate that the viral VEGF, while recognizing a unique profile of the known VEGF receptors (receptor 2 and neuropilin 1), is able to stimulate a striking proliferation of blood vessels in the dermis underlying the site of infection. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that the viral VEGF participates in promoting a distinctive pattern of epidermal proliferation. Loss of a functional viral VEGF resulted in lesions with markedly reduced clinical indications of infection. However, viral replication in the early stages of infection was not impaired, and only at later times did it appear that replication of the recombinant virus might be reduced.",M2
11022792,"Sequence and functional analysis of a homolog of interleukin-10 encoded by the parapoxvirus <e>orf</e> virus.Orf virus is a large DNA virus and is the type species of the Parapoxvirus genus of the family Poxviridae. Orf virus infects the epithelium of sheep and goats and is transmissible to humans. Recently we discovered a gene in orf virus that encodes a polypeptide with remarkable homology to mammalian interleukin (IL-10) and viral encoded IL-10s of herpes viruses. The predicted polypeptide sequence shows high levels of amino acid identity to IL-10 of sheep (80%), cattle (75%), humans (67%) and mice (64%), as well as IL-10-like proteins of Epstein-Barr virus (63%) and equine herpes virus (67%). The C-terminal region, comprising two-thirds of the orf virus protein, is identical to ovine IL-10 which suggests that this gene has been captured from its host sheep during the evolution of orf virus. In contrast the N-terminal region shows little homology with cellular IL10s and in this respect resembles other viral IL-10s. IL-10 is a pleiotrophic cytokine that can exert either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects on many cell types. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine with inhibitory effects on non-specific immunity in particular macrophage function and Thl effector function. Our studies so far, indicate, that the functional activities of orf virus IL-10 are the same as ovine IL-10. Orf virus IL-10 stimulates mouse thymocyte proliferation and inhibits cytokine synthesis in lipopolysaccharide-activated ovine macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes and keratinocytes. Infection of sheep with an IL-10 deletion mutant of orf virus has shown that interferon-gamma levels are higher in tissue infected with the mutant virus than the parent virus. The functional activities of IL-10 and our data on orf virus IL-10 suggest a role in immune evasion.",M2

Although, rare complications have been mentioned. We report a case of Orf with erythema multiforme in a young girl. CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old girl presented to our department with an erythema multiform. The cutaneous examination revealed painless erythematous nodule of her right index finger developed 15 days after a contact with a lamb. The diagnosis of Orf complicated by erythema multiforme was made on the basis of her typical history. Lesions heal with symptomatic therapy in 15 days. DISCUSSION: Orf presents in sheeps as a pustular dermatitis or a vesicular oral mucosal lesions, and in man as a single lesion on the site of infection. This lesion generally heals without complications, although secondary infection is not uncommon. Twenty one cases of erythema multiforme have been recorded following infection with the Orf virus. In typical cases, the diagnosis is established by a history of contact with infected animals and the appearance of the lesion. Electron microscopic examination can be helpful sometimes.

Lambs were depleted of specific lymphocyte subsets by the intravenous administration of monoclonal antibodies against ovine lymphocyte surface markers and then challenged with orf virus. The skin lesions that developed were scored visually as to their severity. Blood samples were collected to monitor the lymphocyte depletions and to measure orf-virus-specific antibody levels. Skin biopsies were collected from the lesion site and studied to determine the course of the infection and the presence of various cell types and orf virus. All the sheep developed orf virus lesions after infection. All three of the CD4-depleted lambs were unable to clear virus from their skin and did not have an antibody response to the virus. Virus was also detected in the skin of one each of the three CD8-depleted, WC1-depleted and control sheep on the final day of the trial. CD8(+) lymphocytes did not appear to be essential for viral clearance later in the infection. Depletion of the majority of gammadelta(+) T-cells did not affect the outcome of orf virus infection. In sheep with high orf-virus-specific antibody titres at the time of infection, orf lesions healed faster than lesions in sheep with low antibody levels, and this occurred regardless of the lymphocyte depletion status of the animals. This study suggests that the presence of CD4(+) T-cells and orf-virus-specific antibodies are important for the control of viral replication in the skin of infected sheep.",M2

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate restriction enzyme DNA fragments and heterogeneity among isolates from different geographic areas could be observed on stained gels.

10614496,"Immunomodulation by virulence proteins of the parapoxvirus <e>orf</e> virus.Three orf virus putative virulence proteins are described that exhibit immunomodulatory functions. The OVIFNR gene at the left terminus of the viral genome encodes an interferon resistance protein with homology to the E3L gene of vaccinia virus. OVIFNR functions by preventing a dsRNA-dependent kinase from inhibiting virus and cell protein synthesis as part of the interferon-induced anti-viral state within infected cells. The orf virus orthologue of the ovine interleukin-10 (vIL-10) gene is located at the right terminus of the viral genome. Both vIL-10 and host (ovine) IL-10 function in vitro as inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes and macrophages, and both inhibit IFN-gamma production from activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Both the orf virus vIL-10 and ovine IL-10 stimulate mast cell and thymocyte proliferation. In this respect the orf virus IL-10 differs from Epstein Barr virus IL-10 which does not exhibit cell proliferative activity. Finally, the orf virus GM-CSF inhibitory factor gene (GIF) at the right terminus of the viral genome encodes an inhibitor of GM-CSF that also binds IL-2. Together, these viral proteins are capable of inhibiting key components of the ovine anti-virus immune and inflammatory response.",M2

Genetic mapping and sequencing of the orf virus genome have revealed that orf virus has a typical poxvirus distribution of genes, with those essential for viral DNA synthesis, replication and packaging located in the central region, and those involved in virulence concentrated in the terminal regions. The immune and inflammatory response to orf virus infection in the skin and local lymph is vigorous and typical of an anti-viral response, involving CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, interferons and antibodies. In spite of this, the virus can repeatedly infect sheep. Host acquired immunity involving CD4+ T cells and interferons is effective in controlling the extent of viral replication, but does not prevent reinfection. Several virus putative virulence genes have been identified. These are: viral homologues of ovine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); ovine IL-10; vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance gene; and in addition a viral activity that inhibits the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
