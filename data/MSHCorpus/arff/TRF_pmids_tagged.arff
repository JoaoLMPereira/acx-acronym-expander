1901843,"Effect of human growth hormone-releasing factor and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor on growth, carcass composition, diet digestibility, nutrient balance, and plasma constituents in dairy calves.Sixty male dairy grain-fed calves, raised from 70 to 223 kg BW in individual crates, were used in a 2 X 2 factorial arrangement to determine the effect of administration of human growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 (GRF) and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>). Calves received twice-daily s.c. injections of .9% NaCl (control), GRF (5 micrograms/kg BW), TRF (1 micrograms/kg BW) or GRF (5 micrograms/kg BW) plus TRF (1 micrograms/kg GTRF). Average daily gain and days on feed were not affected by treatments, but TRF treatment increased (P less than .05) total intake of dry matter (DM) and feed conversion ratio: 3.00, 3.02, 3.08, and 3.22 kg DM/kg weight gain for control, GRF, TRF, and GTRF, respectively. During two 7-d periods, after 66 and 75 d of treatment, feces and urine were collected from 40 calves (5 per treatment per period). Treatment with GRF increased (P less than .05) digestibility of DM, nitrogen (N), and energy and tended (P less than .20) to increase N retention. At slaughter, withers height was increased (P = .05) by GRF and carcass length was increased (P less than .05) by TRF. Pituitary and liver weights were increased (P less than .05) by TRF. The combination of GRF and TRF slightly increased (P less than .10) protein content and decreased (P less than .05) fat content of the 9-10-11th rib section. After d 1, GRF treatment chronically increased (P less than .05) insulin concentrations and also increased (P less than .10) IGF-I concentrations on d 29 and 57. In summary, chronic treatment with GRF and(or) TRF did not improve growth or efficiency, although GRF increased digestibility of DM, N, and energy and the GRF plus TRF combination resulted in slightly leaner carcasses.",M1
1901540,"Effect of long-term administration of human growth hormone-releasing factor and (or) thyrotropin-releasing factor on hormone concentrations in lactating dairy cows.Fifteen cows (87 +/- 8 d in lactation; 641 +/- 33 kg BW) were randomly assigned to treatment and then subjected for 182 d to daily sc injection (1000 hr), in the cervical area, of saline (control), thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>: 1 micrograms/kg BW), growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 (GRF; 10 micrograms/kg BW) or GRF plus TRF (10 and 1 micrograms/kg BW, respectively) according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. On days 1, 31, 88 and 179, jugular blood samples were collected from 2 hr before to 6 hr after injection. Samples were also collected for 5 consecutive days after cessation of treatment. GRF always induced growth hormone (GH) release (600 vs 7925 ng.min/ml) with augmentation of response with time (interaction GRF * day; P less than .001). TRF did not affect (P greater than .25) GH release; there was no interaction (P greater than .25) with time. There was no significant interaction (P greater than .25) between GRF and TRF on GH release. However, the amount of GH release with GRF plus TRF was always greater than with GRF alone (9419 vs 6431 ng.min/ml). TRF induced a significant release of prolactin (23769 vs 42175 ng.min/ml) but GRF reduced the amount of prolactin release on the last day of sampling. TRF induced thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release only on the first day of injection while triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) continued to respond to TRF throughout the treatment period. Concentrations of T3 and T4 fell below control levels after cessation of TRF injection. In conclusion, GRF-induced GH release and TRF-induced Prl and thyroid hormone release were maintained over a 6-mo treatment period. TRF induced TSH release only on the first day of injection. Overall, these results raised the possibility of a direct effect of TRF on the thyroid gland.",M1
2124532,"Dose effect of human growth hormone-releasing factor and thyrotropin-releasing factor on hormone concentrations in lactating dairy cows.Two experiments were conducted to study the effects of growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) and thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) administration on hormone concentrations in dairy cows. In the first trial, 12 cows were used on 5 consecutive days to determine the effect of four sc doses of GRF (0, 1.1, 3.3 and 10 micrograms.kg-1 BW) and three sc doses of TRF (0, 1.1 and 3.3 micrograms.kg-1 BW) combined in a factorial arrangement. GRF and TRF acted in synergy (P = .02) on serum growth hormone (GH) concentration even at the lowest dose tested and GH response to the two releasing factors was higher than the maximal response observed with each factor alone. TRF increased (P less than .01) prolactin (Prl), thyrotropin (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations similarly at the 1.1 and 3.3 micrograms.kg-1 doses and GRF did not interact (P greater than .40) with TRF on the release of these hormones. In the second trial, the effect of GRF (3.3 micrograms.kg-1 BW, sc) and TRF (1.1 micrograms.kg-1 BW, sc) was tested at three stages (18, 72 and 210 days) of lactation on serum Prl and TSH concentrations. Eighteen cows (n = 6 per stage of lactation) were used in two replicates of a 3 X 3 latin square. The TRF and GRF-TRF treatments were equipotent (P greater than .05) in increasing Prl and TSH concentrations. Prl and TSH responses were similar (P greater than .40) throughout lactation. In summary, GRF at doses ranging from 1.1 to 10.0 micrograms.kg-1 and TRF at doses ranging from 1.1 to 3.3 micrograms.kg-1 act in synergy on GH release and do not interact on Prl, TSH, T3 and T4 concentrations in dairy cows. Furthermore, Prl and TSH response to TRF are not affected by stage of lactation.",M1
2119375,"Effect of human growth hormone-releasing factor and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor on hormone concentrations in dairy calves.To determine the effect of chronic treatment with human growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 (GRF) and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>), 20 calves averaging 70.2 kg BW were divided into four groups (n = 5) according to a 2 X 2 factorial design. For 86 d, calves in each group received twice daily s.c. injections of either .9% NaCl, GRF (5 micrograms/kg BW), TRF (1 microgram/kg BW) or GRF (5 micrograms/kg BW) plus TRF (1 microgram/kg BW). On d 87, all calves received a s.c. injection of GRF (5 micrograms/kg BW) plus TRF (1 microgram/kg BW). Blood samples were collected every 20 min for 18 h on d 1, 29, 57 and 85, and for 8 h on d 87. Hormone responses were measured as area under the hormone concentration curve over time. GRF and TRF acted in synergy (P less than .10) on GH release throughout the treatment period. Growth hormone responsiveness to GRF and(or) TRF decreased (P less than .01) with days of treatment, but this decrease was due to aging rather than to chronic treatment, because GH response to GRF plus TRF was similar (P greater than .10) between control and treated calves on d 87. TRF increased prolactin (Prl) concentration until the end of the treatment period (P less than .01). The response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to TRF disappeared (P greater than .10) after 1 mo of treatment, whereas the thyroxine (T4) response decreased (P less than .01) throughout the treatment period. GRF did not induce nor did it interact with TRF on TSH and T4 release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
2163305,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibits the hormonal response of the pituitary gland to hypothalamic releasing factors.Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a monokine produced by activated macrophages and monocytes, may be an essential mediator of the pathogenesis and of the hormonal response to endotoxic shock. It has been suggested that an elevated level of TNF alpha is a marker for morbidity and mortality during septic shock, and that treatment with antibodies against TNF alpha decreases mortality. Because monokines have been shown to interact at the hypothalamic-pituitary level, we have studied the effect of TNF alpha on basal and stimulated hormone release from normal rat anterior pituitary cells. After 3 days of incubation, primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells were stimulated with either 0.5 ng/ml CRF, 3 ng/ml AVP, 10 ng/ml angiotensin II (AII), 10(-6) M <e>TRF</e>, 10(-8) M LHRH, or 10(-8) M GHRH, alone or in the presence of 20 or 50 ng/ml human or murine recombinant TNF alpha. The culture media were analyzed for ACTH, GH, LH, and PRL content. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated 3 to 8 times. Time-course experiments (n = 3) demonstrated that TNF alpha inhibited CRF-stimulated ACTH production over a period of 8, 16, and 24 h, but had no effect before a period of 4 h. At doses ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml, TNF alpha did not affect basal ACTH secretion but inhibited CRF-stimulated ACTH release in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 approximately 10 ng/ml). At a dose of 50 ng/ml, TNF alpha inhibited AVP-stimulated ACTH release by 30% and blocked the effect of AII. TNF alpha (20 and 50 ng/ml) completely prevented the CRF-AVP potentiation of ACTH release. Similarly, TNF alpha inhibited the stimulated release of GH (100% inhibition), LH (35% inhibition), and PRL (100% inhibition). TNF alpha had no effect on the basal secretion of GH or LH but inhibited basal PRL in a dose-dependent manner. The administration of the monokine did not cause any cellular damage because 48 h after removal of the TNF alpha treatment the cells showed normal basal and stimulated hormone levels in response to their specific stimuli. Incubation of TNF alpha solutions with antibody to TNF alpha reversed all TNF alpha actions. These data suggest that TNF alpha inhibits the secretion of pituitary hormones and particularly suppresses the response of the corticotroph cells. This inhibitory effect may contribute to the increased mortality observed in cases of severe septic shock with high circulating TNF alpha levels.",M1
2105928,"Effect of long-term administration of porcine growth hormone-releasing factor and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor on growth hormone, prolactin and thyroxine concentrations in growing pigs.Long-term administration of porcine growth hormone-releasing factor (pGRF(1-29)NH2) and(or) thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) was evaluated on serum concentrations of growth hormone (GH) thyroxine (T4) and prolactin (PRL). Twenty-four 12-wk-old female Yorkshire-Landrace pigs were injected at 1000 and 1600 for 12 wk with either saline, pGRF (15 micrograms/kg), TRF (6 micrograms/kg) or pGRF + TRF using a 2 x 2 factorial design. Blood samples were collected on d 1, 29, 57 and 85 of treatment from 0400 to 2200. Areas under the GH, T4 and PRL curves (AUC) for the 6 h (0400 to 1000) prior to injection were subtracted from the postinjection periods (1000 to 1600, 1600 to 2200) to calculate the net hormonal response. The AUC of GH for the first 6 h decreased similarly (P less than .05) with age for all treatments. The GH response to GRF remained unchanged (P greater than .10) across age. TRF alone did not stimulate (P less than .05) GH release but acted in synergy with GRF to increase (P less than .05) GH release. TRF stimulated (P less than .001) the net response of T4 on all sampling days. Animals treated with the combination of GRF + TRF showed a decreased T4 AUC during the first 6 h on the last three sampling days. Basal PRL decreased (P less than .05) with age. Over the four sampling days, animals injected with TRF alone showed (P less than .01) a reduction (linear effect; P less than .01) followed by an increase (quadratic effect; P less than .05) in total PRL concentration after injection; however, when GRF was combined with TRF, such effects were not observed (P greater than .10). Results showed that 1) chronic injections of GRF for 12 wk sustained GH concentration, 2) TRF and GRF acted synergistically to elevate GH AUC, 3) TRF increased T4 concentrations throughout the 12-wk treatment period, 4) chronic TRF treatment decreased the basal PRL concentration and 5) chronic GRF + TRF treatment decreased the basal concentration of T4.",M1
2551657,"Thyrotropin-releasing factor-induced adrenocorticotropin secretion is mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor.TSH-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>), administered into the lateral cerebroventricle of adult male rats, elevated plasma concentrations of ACTH, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. TRF given iv was devoid of these activities. The CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (CRF9-41) given iv suppressed the TRF-induced increase in ACTH, but did not alter TRF-induced changes in plasma catecholamines. Intravenous administration of CRF antiserum totally blocked TRF-induced elevation of plasma ACTH concentrations. CRF receptor antagonists administered icv attenuated CRF-induced, but not TRF-induced elevation of plasma concentrations of ACTH, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. It is concluded from these results that TRF acts within the central nervous system to stimulate ACTH release through a CRF-dependent mechanism.",M1
3127084,"Thyrotroph function assessed by sensitive measurement of thyrotropin with three immunoradiometric assay kits: analytical evaluation and comparison with the thyroliberin stimulation test.We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of three  sensitive  immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) kits (Tandem-R TSH HS, Hybritech, Inc.; EchoClonal TSH, Bio-Rad; Coat-A-Count TSH IRMA, Diagnostic Products Corp.) for measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) and compared their performance against a  regular  IRMA (ARIA-HT, Becton-Dickinson) to determine whether these assays might eliminate the need to perform the thyroliberin (<e>TRF</e>) stimulation test. We concluded that the Tandem and EchoClonal kits may obviate the need to perform TRF stimulation tests in some patients. Using only the basal TSH concentration to predict the TSH response to TRF, we found all three sensitive TSH assays to be useful for detecting abnormal thyrotroph function. Dose-response, linearity, analytical recovery, and specificity were acceptable for all kits, but intra-assay precision at very low TSH concentrations and analytical sensitivity differed considerably among the kits. Using the EchoClonal assay, we established a normal reference interval for TSH of 0.4-4.6 milli-int. units/L.",M1
2907311,"Synergism and diurnal variations of human growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 and thyrotropin-releasing factor on growth hormone release in dairy calves.Sixteen male Holstein calves averaging 168 kg body weight (BW) were used to determine the effects of human growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 (hGRF (1-29)NH2; .22 micrograms/kg BW), thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>; .165 micrograms/kg BW) or hGRF (1-29)NH2 plus TRF (.22 and .165 micrograms/kg BW, respectively) on growth hormone (GH) release in animals exposed to 16 hr of light (L): 8 hr of dark (D) (lights on at 0100 hr) and hGRF plus TRF (.22 and .165 micrograms/kg BW, respectively) in animals exposed to 8L:16D (lights on at 0900 hr). For each treatment, times of iv injection were 0400, 1000, 1600 and 2200 hr. In animals exposed to 16L:8D, average GH peaks reached after hGRF (1-29)NH2 or TRF injections were 49.7 and 32.0 ng/ml while the area under the GH response curve (AUC) were 1247 and 1019 ng/ml.min, respectively. There was no significant effect of times of injection on GH release following the separate injection of hGRF(1-29)NH2 or TRF. In animals exposed to 16L:8D, GH peaks and AUC after hGRF plus TRF injections were 226.4, 189.2 and 116.8 ng/ml, and 4340, 3660 and 2415 ng/ml.min at 0400, 1000 and 1600 hr (lights on), respectively but only 42.3 ng/ml and 1692 ng/ml.min at 2200 hr (lights off).

3128159,"[TeBG and thyrotoxicosis in the hot thyroid nodule]The binding capacity of serum TeBG (testosterone-estradiol binding globulin), the plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones and the TSH response to <e>TRF</e> (200 micrograms i.v.) have been measured in female patients with a solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (n = 26) or with a cold thyroid nodule (n = 20). It was found that TeBG was higher than the upper limit for normal (1.77 micrograms/dl) in the patients (n = 10) with increased serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and in 5 patients among 16 with normal thyroid hormone levels. After surgical removal of the nodule, the increased TeBG levels fell down within the normal, while the response of TSH to TRF which was suppressed before surgery, was recovered. In patients with a cold nodule, the administration of dl-Thyroxine (200-300 micrograms/daily) suppressed the response of TSH to TRF and increased slightly TeBG from 0.97 +/- 0.08 to 1.29 +/- 0.10 micrograms/dl (p less than 0.05) with a value higher than 1.77 micrograms/dl in 5. These data suggested that the pituitary secretion of TSH and the liver production of TeBG have a different threshold of sensitivity to thyroid hormones action. It is proposed that the measure of TeBG is a tool for the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in patients with autonomous thyroid nodules.",M1
3093998,"[Dopamine in the pathogenesis of normogonadotropic amenorrhea]A total of 108 patients with normo-gonadotropic amenorrhea and 25 normal females were investigated. Three dopamine-dependent parameters were under study: maximum range of changes in the blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone, hypophyseal response to thyrotropin releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) and prolactinemia-dependent therapeutic effect of bromocriptine. Significantly increased range of the serum gonadotropin levels, increased reaction of hypophyseal thyrotropic hormone to TRF and higher therapeutic efficiency of bromocriptine was revealed in hyperprolactinemic patients versus those with normo-gonadotropic amenorrhea. The results obtained are indicative of the decreased dopaminergic tension of the tuberoinfundibular system in hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea and increased one in normoprolactinemic patients. In 15 out of 32 normoprolactinemic patients bromocriptine therapy normalized their menstrual cycles. The range of spontaneous changes in the blood levels of LH was supposed to be a prognostic criterion for the assessment of bromocriptine therapeutic efficiency. A relative hypophyseal deficiency of dopamine was suggested in some of normoprolactinemic patients.",M1
3089346,"[Mechanism of the antidepressive and learning-stimulating effects of thyroliberin and its analogs]To define the role of different fragments of <e>TRF</e> molecule in its neurotropic activity a number of newly synthesized dipeptides of pyroglutamic acid with beta-alanine residue, GABA or GABA ester have been studied. The compounds were compared with TRF in their ability to influence spontaneous or amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity in mice and to affect the elaboration of passive avoidance reflex in rats. Unlike TRF, the pyroglutamate dipeptides studied were shown to exhibit no activity in amphetamine potentiation test, thus providing additional evidence of the importance ofthe  histidylproline  fragment in TRF antidepressant effect. On the other hand, the above pyroglutamate derivatives caused a pronounced improvement in the learning abilities of under-trained rats. These dipeptides were shown to be more active in this test than TRF. This suggests the important role of pyroglutamyl moiety in the stimulation of the learning processes.",M1
6437790,"[Functional state of the thyroid and its regulatory system in tumor-bearing animals]A comparative study of labelled thyroxine and iodine accumulation was carried out in the thyroid endocrine complex under endoliquor and intraabdominal introduction of thyrotropic hormone (TTH) and thyrotropin-releasing-factor (<e>TRF</e>) in rats with transplantable and induced tumours as well as in intact animals. A sharp decrease of the system response to TRF in tumour-bearing animals was established. The incorporation of labelled thyroxine introduced into the thyroid gland tissue and posterior region of the hypothalamus is found to be lower under the tumour growth. The character of changes causing the disturbances in the activity of the thyroid gland should be taken into account in an attempt to normalize the gland activity. The normalization should be based on the complex influence directed to all the links of the hypothalamus-pituitary thyroid gland system.",M1
6420206,"Long-term monolayer culture of human anterior pituitary cells: functional validation of a method.This study demonstrates the response of human pituitary cell monolayers to a wide variety of hormonal stimuli. Appropriate release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) was used as a verification of cell function. Cells that had been in culture for 20 days, with no hormonal additions, were exposed to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) continuously for 14 days. This resulted in an immediate fivefold increase in secretion of LH followed by a depression in LH production over the remaining 10-day period. After an 8-day period without hormonal additions, the same cultures again demonstrated a threefold increase in response to retreatment with LH-RH. In two similar studies, cells that had been in culture for 28 and 31 days were treated with bromocriptine, pergolide, dopamine, or thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>). TRF elicited an increase of PRL in the medium by nearly double the control values. The addition of dopamine, pergolide, or bromocriptine resulted in a depression of PRL during the treatment period. This study has shown that human pituitary cells maintained in long-term monolayer culture respond predictably to a wide range of hormonal stimuli.",M1
6148738,"Recent studies on the role of brain peptides in control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion.Recent work in our laboratory on the role of peptides to influence release of pituitary hormones by direct action on the gland and also some of the interactions of these peptides at the hypothalamic level to alter release of pituitary hormones will be reviewed. Considerable evidence from hypothalamic stimulation and lesion studies suggests the existence of a separate FSH-releasing factor (FSHRF). We have been able to purify a bioactive FSHRF which appears to be distinct from LHRH. Consequently, we believe that a distinct FSHRF will ultimately be isolated. With regard to prolactin, it is now clear that it is under dual control by both prolactin-inhibiting (PI) and prolactin-releasing factors (PRF). Although dopamine acts as a PIF, our recent fractionation studies indicate the existence of a peptidic PIF in hypothalamic extracts which can be separated from dopamine and GABA. The peptidic PIF is eluted from Sephadex in the same position originally described by us a number of years ago. Thus, inhibitory control is probably mediated by a combination of factors which would include dopamine, possibly GABA and a peptidic PIF. A number of peptides have been shown to have PRF activity which include <e>TRF</e> and also VIP. In recent studies, we have shown a prolactin-releasing action of oxytocin on male hemipituitaries or dispersed pituitary cells. Furthermore, high doses of oxytocin given intravenously released prolactin in male rats. There is a correlation between estrogen-induced prolactin release and an increase in plasma oxytocin and a correlation between suckling-induced oxytocin and prolactin release. These results suggest that oxytocin may be an important PRF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
6420863,"[Role of the <e>TRF</e> test in the study of atrial dysrhythmia]The aim of this retrospective study of 43 patients (32 females) aged 26 to 84 years old (mean 62 +/- 14,5) was to assess the value of the TRF test in cases with normal static endocrine levels and isolated arrhythmias: 25 atrial fibrillations, 3 atrial flutters, 10 sinus tachycardias, 2 junctional tachycardias, 2 focal atrial tachycardias and 1 atrial extrasystoles. There was underlying cardiac disease in 24 patients. Thyroid function was assessed by T4, T3 and the TRF test. There was no relationship between cardiac disease and arrhythmias with the levels of TSH 25 minutes after TRF. The reactivity to TRF was low: 5,8 +/- 5,6 microU/ml. Nineteen patients were hyperthyroid (TSH at O and 25 min: 1,7 +/- 0,5 and 2 +/- 1 microU/ml respectively), in the following three eventualities: - Clinical hyperthyroidism and raised hormonal levels, the TRF confirmed the diagnosis in 10 out of 11 cases; - Clinical hyperthyroidism and normal hormone levels: the TRF confirmed the diagnosis in 8 out of 14 cases; - Normal clinical examination and normal hormone levels: the TRF test showed a hyperthyroid reaction in 1 out of 18 cases. T3 and T4 measurements are often misleading. The TRF test with 2 blood samples would appear to be essential, especially in patients over 60 years of age. The hyperthyroid population was older (68,5 +/- 8 years) and the mean values of the thyroid investigations (T3, T4 and STH at 25 minutes) were significant. Underlying cardiac disease was detected in over half these cases. Atrial fibrillation was the commonest arrhythmia. Each case of arrhythmia, whether or not related to hyperthyroidism, justifies echocardiography.",M1
6414205,"LRF and <e>TRF</e> test during long-term danazol treatment: increase of the LH and FSH responses but decrease of the prolactin and TSH responses.Seven patients suffering from severe endometriosis were treated with danazol 200 mg X 3 daily for 6 months. Clinical symptoms were alleviated and menses disappeared in response to the treatment. After cessation of the treatment the menstrual bleedings returned in 1-3 months. Blood samples for determination of gonadotrophins, prolactin (Prl), oestradiol (E2), progesterone, thyroid hormones and thyrotrophin in radioimmunoassays were taken and a combined TRF and LRF test carried out in the follicular phase before treatment, at the 6th month of treatment and after reappearance of the first menses. There were no statistically significant changes in the basal levels of serum FSH, LH or TSH during the danazol treatment. Neither was there any change in episodic secretions of FSH, LH or Prl, as determined by the mean coefficients of variation of the hormone levels in seven consecutive samples taken at 20 min intervals. On the other hand, serum E2, Prl and thyroid hormone levels were significantly decreased in the 6th month of treatment. In the TRF-LRF test the responses of serum FSH and LH were significantly higher and those of serum Prl and TSH significantly lower during danazol treatment than before. Prl responses remained lowered after the treatment. It appears that low serum oestrogen levels, induced by the danazol treatment, sensitize the pituitary gonadotrophs to exogenous LRF, but make the sensitivity of thyrotrophs and lactotrophs lower to exogenous TRF. These results thus indicate that danazol does not make the pituitary gonadotrophs insensitive to LRF, but danazol may rather inhibit the secretion of hypothalamic LRF.",M1
6403331,"Hormone ontogeny in the ovine fetus. XV. Studies of adenohypophysial hormones after fetal pituitary stalk section: evidence for an extrahypothalamic dopaminergic influence on fetal prolactin secretion.The administration of a dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, to the ovine fetus in late gestation elevates plasma concentrations of PRL, suggesting tonic dopaminergic inhibition of fetal PRL secretion. The source of this dopaminergic inhibition was investigated in chronically catheterized ovine fetuses (104-135 days of gestation) after hypophysial stalk section (SS; n = 4) and in sham-operated controls (CON; n = 7). Basal PRL levels were similar in the two groups of fetuses. After the administration of <e>TRF</e> (250 micrograms, iv), PRL levels rose comparably in both the SS and CON fetuses. The only difference was a higher mean incremental response (P less than 0.02) in the SS fetuses. The dopamine agonist apomorphine (100 micrograms/kg, iv) induced a similar suppression of fetal PRL concentrations in CON (n = 4) and SS (n = 2) fetuses. After the administration of haloperidol (1 mg, iv) to the CON fetuses (n = 7), the concentration of fetal PRL rose (P less than 0.01). In the SS fetus (n = 4), haloperidol induced a rise in PRL concentrations (P less than 0.01); however, the response to haloperidol was less (P less than 0.01) in SS than in CON fetuses. These data suggest that there is persistent dopaminergic inhibition of PRL secretion in the fetus after complete stalk section, and that the source of this dopamine is extrahypothalamic. The greater incremental PRL response to TRH and the lesser response to haloperidol in the SS fetus than in CON are evidence for a hypothalamic component to the dopaminergic inhibition in the intact fetus. Basal FSH concentrations and the gonadotropin response to LRF were not affected by stalk section in fetuses studied 5-8 days after surgery. Both the PRL and the GH responses to 5-hydroxytryptophan were abolished by stalk section. After stalk section GH levels fell, however, significant concentrations of GH were measurable in fetal plasma in late gestation, which suggests that the fetal pituitary can secrete GH in the absence of hypothalamic stimulation at this stage in gestation.",M1

A resume.This research shows that the adenohypophysis of the adolescent differs from that of the adult by sensibility variations vis-a-vis of LHRH and <e>TRF</e> in relation to the growing rates of the ovarian steroids and their actions on the steroid and peptide receptors of the hypophyseal cells. During the first few years after the menarche, the increasing secretion of estradiol provokes a greater secretion of the four adenohypophyseal hormones both before and after LHRH and TRF. As the adolescent grows older, the increasing amounts of progesterone in relation to the increasing amounts of estradiol reduce the sensibility of the hypophysis to the releasing hormones; the release of its trophic hormones and prolactin is diminished. This would indicate that the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian system undergoes progressive maturation for a number of years after the menarche. The sensibility of the adolescent pituitary, ovary, and thyroid during the luteal phase of the first menstrual cycle after oral contraceptives have been discontinued is the same in girls who have taken oral contraceptives for 24 months or longer as it is in girls who are five to six years after the menarche and have not taken oral contraceptives.",M1

Of the studies cited, the most convincing evidence suggests that PCA is derived from glutamine. Enzymes which selectivity remove PCA from the N-terminus, and of benefit in amino-acid sequence analysis, have been isolated and shown to have a ubiquitous distribution in various animal and plant cells.

The antibodies thus raised detect changes in pGlu and Pro-NH2 residues and have broadly similar crossreactivity patterns. The histidine residue also provides the possibility of incorporating radioiodine in the molecule. Cation exchange chromatography separates [125I2]-TRF from [125I]-TRF and TRF and produces tracer for TRF radioimmunoassay. Although TRF antisera are specific, many normal tissue constituents and chemical compounds, when present in high concentrations, interfere with TRF radioimmunoassays, leading to artificially high TRF levels. Hence to obtain reliable results the interfering compounds have to be removed before TRF is measured by radioimmunoassay. The quantities of immunoreactive TRF found in various rat tissue extracts are as follows: neonatal pancreas, hypothalamus, posterior pituitary 200-600 pg/mg; brain stem, spinal cord, neonatal hypothalamus 50-200 pg/mg; and cerebellum, cerebrum, placenta, pancrease, intestine 0.1-50 pg/mg. TRF is undetectable (below 0.1 pg/mg) in extracts of peripheral nerves, liver, lungs and kidneys. The bulk of the TRF immunoreactivity in pancreatic and brain extracts elutes in reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with gradient elution like synthetic TRF, suggesting that most of the TRF immunoreactivity is due to pGlu-His-Pro-NH2.

The diagnosis of prolactinoma was made in three of the 16 patients by the absence of PRL response to thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) and a dopamine receptor antagonist, metoclopramide, without radiologic evidence of an adenoma. Contrary to findings in subjects with normal PRL values, the PRL rise in response to anesthesia and operation was absent. Other pituitary hormones, with the exception of GH, which increased during anesthesia and operation, exhibited no acute changes. In 11 of 16 cases, complete tumor removal was achieved as determined by the rapid decline of PRL levels to normal values within 24 to 48 hours after operation and by subsequent clinical follow-up. This finding documents that the adenoma is the main source of excessive PRL secretion. The circulating half time of immunoreactive PRL determined by frequent sampling in these patients was variable, ranging from 74 to 190 minutes, significantly longer than the previously reported value of 15 minutes determined by bioassay. Although a transient decline was evident, serum PRL levels remained elevated in those patients with incomplete tumor removal.

112247,"[Ontogenesis of hypothalamic control of adenohypophyseal secretions in the human foetus (author's transl)]The endocrine glands of the human foetus are active early in gestation, and various foetal and placental hormonal contributions are essential for growth and sexual differentiation. 1. The anterior pituitary gland has the ability to synthesize, store and secrete hormones early in gestation. The patterns of change in plasma concentrations of hGH (Fig. 1), ACTH, LH and FSH (Fig. 2) during gestation indicate that secretion is at a maximum at mid-gestation, followed by a progressive decrease towards term. The high levels at mid-gestation can be interpreted as due simultaneously to a high secretion rate, low peripheral catabolism and absence of feedback mechanism. In contrast, the secretions of PRL (Fig. 1) and TSH are moderate at mid-gestation and only increase in the last trimester of gestation. 2. Effective control by the central nervous system (CNS) of the pituitary secretions is still immature at mid-gestation. The presence in the foetal hypothalamus of releasing factors such as LRF (Fig. 5) and <e>TRF</e>, and of somatostatin (Fig. 6), a growth hormone release inhibiting factor (GIF), has been established. TRF and GIF, but not LRF, are also present in the cerebral cortex. It has been postulated that, early in life, relatively autonomous and unrestrained secretion of hypothalamic hypophysiotropic releasing factors occurs, and that, later in development, there is a maturation of inhibitory or restraining influences mediated via the CNS (feedback mechanisms) that modulates the secretion of the foetal adenohypophyseal hormones (Fig. 3 and 4). 3. Observations made with anencephalic newborn confirm that a functional hypothalamus is necessary during foetal life for the secretion of each of the hormones of the anterior pituitary gland with the exception of PRL, the secretion of which is normal in anencephaly. Although somatostatin probably participates in the regulation of hGH during foetal life, it appears evident from the anencephaly data that this regulation can only be fully understood by postulating the existence of a growth hormone releasing factor (GRF).",M1
112215,"Effect of thyrotropin releasing factor on body weight of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis.Earlier studies had demonstrated that in Lymnaea stagnalis thyrotropin releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) may be the secretory product of the so-called dark green neurosecretory cells. The dark green cells are believed to serve an osmoregulatory function. If TRF is the secretory product of the dark green cells, it should be capable of controlling the salt and water balance in L. stagnalis. In this study, the effect and fate of synthetic TRF injected in vivo into L. stagnalis was assessed. It was found that TRF caused an increase in the rate of loss of body water which normally occurs after anaesthesia. TRF also increased the loss of body water when it was administered to unanaesthetized animals. The peptide was accumulated and degraded by the tissues of the foot, mantle, and head regions, tissues which are believed to be the targets of the hormone of the dark green cells.

This abnormal secretion was not blunted by T3 administration. TRF half-life measured in 3 patients was 4 min. These data indicate that 1) there is an abnormal response to TRF in chronic renal failure which does not seem to be due to an altered sensitivity to, or metabolism of TRF; and 2) there is an abnormal TSH secretion which may be responsible for the low T4 and T3 measured in these patients.",M1

It was found that measurable amounts of (3H)TRF are synthesized by newt brain homogenates, that preincubation of these homogenates with protease-free RNase completely abolishes (3H)TRF synthesis, while preincubation of homogenates with inactivated RNase allows for (3H)TRF synthesis to proceed.

A statistically significant rise of the arterial blood pressure and heart rate at an average 1-min interval after injection could be demonstrated. After 5 min the effect had completely vanished. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure like other hemodynamic parameters, the blood sugar and cholesterol did not change. A placebo-like effect could not be shown among a third group receiving only the added solvent. Because of the short interval after which the effect occurred, a determinant role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feed back is very unlikely. A direct stimulus of TRF to smooth muscle cells of arterial walls responsible for vascular resistance in systemic vessels may be suggested as a hypothesis.",M1

In contrast, only TRF reverses amobarbital-induced hypothermia (dose-relatedly). In naive rats, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (25-200 mug) induces convulsions while TRF (5-100 mug) produces intermittent hyperactivity and sedation but never convulsions. To determine whether behavioral events may be regulated in the central nervous system through an interaction of the two naturally occurring compounds, TRF (5-100 mug) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (25-200 mug) were injected simultaneously into the lateral ventricle of the brain of naive rats or rats anesthetized with amobarbital (80 mg/kg).

A solution of TRF (0-1, 0-25, 0-5 and 1 mug/rat) was injected i.v. at 17.00 h into rats pretreated with sodium pentobarbitone at 13.00 h. A group of male rats was also treated with TRF at 11.00 h after pretreatment with sodium pentobarbitone at 07.00 h. Fifteen minutes after TRF administration, blood samples were obtained by heart puncture. Doses of 0-25, 0-5 and 1 mug TRF significantly increased the serum prolactin concentration in pro-oestrous rats. The mean serum prolactin level after the injection of 0-5 and 1 mug into oestrous rats and 0-5 mug TRF into dioestrous day 2 rats, was significantly greater than the control values. Injection of TRF on day 1 of dioestrus had no effect. Serum LH concentration was not significantly modified by the various doses of TRF administered. On day 3 of pseudopregnancy a significant increase of serum prolactin values was obtained with 0-5 and 1 mug TRF. On day 7 of pseudopregnancy a dose of 0-5 mug produced the same effect, but on day 10 of pseudopregnancy only 1 mug TRF significantly increased serum prolactin levels when compared with the control rats. In male rats serum prolactin concentration was significantly greater than the control values after TRF treatment either in the morning or the afternoon.

174388,"Secretion of anterior pituitary hormones in man: effects of ethyl alcohol.The possibility that previously described effects of ethyl alcohol on peripheral endocrine glands might be mediated via pituitary prompted this investigation on the effects of ethanol on anterior pituitary secretion. Nine healthy male subjects were given beverage containing ethanol (1.5 g/kg) or beverage alone per os in a randomized cross-over study and plasma ACTH, FSH, GH, LH and TSH were measured by specific radioimmunoassays up to 15 h and the urinary levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline by fluorometry. A combined LRF and <e>TRF</e> test was also carried out in similar series of experiments. During the whole experiment there were no significant differences in the plasma levels of ACTH, FSH and TSH or in the urinary levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline between ethanol treated and control subjects. Plasma FSH, LH and TSH responses to LRF and TRF stimulation were also similar in alcohol treated and control subjects. Plasma ACTH values were high (113-270 pg/ml) both in control and ethanol experiment suggesting that the subjects experienced apprehension toward the experiment. Plasma GH level exhibited a non-sleep related burst in the late evening (from 0.4 ng/ml at 6 p.m. to 3.1 ng/ml at 10 p.m., p less than 0.01). This increase was not seen after alcohol ingestion (p less than 0.01). Plasma LH levels were significantly lower after 6 and 13 h in alcohol treated subjects than in controls (65 vs. 106 ng/ml, p less than 0.01 and 74 vs. 121 ng/ml, p less than 0.05 respectively).

No differences dependent on age or sex were found. Stimulation by intravenous injection of 100 mug of TRF has been carried out in 7 euthyroid children and in 14 with hypothyroidism. TSH was determined prior to, and during TRF stimulation. Among other thyroid tests included in this study were: serum T3 uptake, total thyroxine, serum protein-bound iodine, 131INa uptake and thyroid scanning. In the euthyroid children, TSH at zero time was 4.4 muUI/ml.; a significant increase was reached at 30-40 minutes. In 13 children with a light primary hypothyroidism, TSH was little increased in correlation with other parameters assessed. In two children with true primary hypothyroidism, TSH at zero time was X 465 muUI/ml., showing an increase at 30 minutes of X 550 muUL/ml. which was in agreement with the absence of thyroid tissue, showed by the scanning image and with the low concentration of thyroid hormones.

810344,"Effect of hypothalamic deafferentation on the secretion of thyrotropin in resting conditions in the rat.Complete hypothalamic deafferentation in normal male rats, either limited to the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, and basal parts of ventromedial nuclei, or including, in addition, the ventromedial nuclei, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and a large part of the posterior hypothalamus, caused a decrease of resting serum TSH levels and a marked lowering of the pituitary TSH concentration. Partial frontal anterior cuts caused similar changes, whereas partial posterolateral cuts, or a complete deafferentation extended rostrally to include suprachiasmatic nuclei and caudal parts of the anterior hypothalamus, were without effect. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine levels in animals with the effective types of deafferentations were, after an initial short-lived decrease, within normal range despite persistent low TSH levels. Destruction of the median eminence-arcuate nucleus by electrolytic lesions in either normal or deafferented animals lowered serum TSH more than deafferentations alone, and caused a lasting decrease of serum T4 levels. We have concluded that the low serum TSH levels of the deafferented animals are caused by a partial impairment of <e>TRF</e> release from the median eminence-arcuate nucleus complex. This impairment seems, in turn, to be caused by the severance of the connection of the basal mid-hypothalamic structures with the more rostal parts of the hypothalamus. Our results also indicate that normal circulating levels of thyroid hormones can be maintained even at reduced serum TSH levels.",M1
810343,"Growth hormone release in the rat: effects of somatostatin and thyrotropin-releasing factor.Morphine sulfate (MS) and pentobarbital (PB) stimulate growth hormone (GH) release in the rat in vivo, but not from enzymatically dissociated anterior pituitary cells in vitro. Somatostatin and thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>) inhibit the in vivo release of GH induced by MS, with 50% inhibition at ca. 2.3 and 4.6 mug/100 g BW, respectively. Somatostatin and TRF similarly inhibit PB-induced GH release. Prostaglandin E2 stimulates GH release both in vivo and in vitro. Both of these responses are inhibited by somatostatin (50% inhibition at ca. 10 mug/100g BW), but neither is altered by TRF (100 mug/100g BW). Both normal and hypophysectomized rats receiving MS exhibited a rapid vibration of the tail immediately after administration of TRF (30 mug/100g BW). Structural analogs of TRF with low TSH-releasing activity did not inhibit GH release nor induced tail vibration in MS-treated rats. Pyroglutamyl-3-methyl-histidyl-prolinamide, with 8 times the hypophysiotropic potency of TRF, is similarly more potent than TRF in inhibiting GH release and inducing tail vibration in MS-treated rats. These results suggest the following: 1) MS and PB act at a central nervous system (CNS) site to release GH; 2) TRF may act at a CNS site to inhibit MS- and PB-induced GH release; 3) somatostatin has direct pituitary effects on inhibition of GH, but a CNS site of action cannot be excluded; and 4) TRF stimulates tail motor activity in MS-treated rats.",M1

The influence of MIF and TRF on the antagonistic effect of L-DOPA of harmine tremors in rabbits was also studied. MIF and TRF, injected i.p., intensify the effects of L-DOPA in mice. The minimal dose of MIF required to induce a +3 response is 0.1 microgram/kg; TRF is active at 500 micrograms/kg. When MIF or TRF are injected into the brain, potentiation of L-DOPA is obtained with exceedingly small quantities of MIF (0.1 pg); the effective dose of TRF is 1 microgram. The behavioral effects of 5-HTP are potentiated by TRF only, at doses of 0.1 microgram/kg, i.p. When TRF is administered intracerebrally, the active dose per mouse is 0.1 ng. Harmine (5 mg/kg i.v.) induced, in the rabbit, sustained whole body tremors; if L-DOPA (5 mg/kg) is  administered i.v. at the peak of the harmine effect, tremors subside. When the rabbit is pretreated with MIF administered i.p. 1 -2 hr before harmine, in doses devoid of an antitumor effect per se (10 micrograms/kg), the L-DOPA antagonism appears at lower dose. Also dopamine (5-10 mg/kg i,v.) proved effective in abating harmine tremors; previous treatment with MIF (50 micrograms/kg) potentiated the antagonistic effect of dopamine. According to the prevailing theories on the mechanism of neurotransmission, some hypotheses will be discussed to explain the observed potentiation: impaired uptake, impaired degradation, interference with the turnover of the boiamines, supersensitivity of the receptors.",M1
806824,"Action of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (lrf) in the initiation of lordosis behavior in the estrone-primed ovariectomized female rat.In order to evaluate the precise role of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LRF) in mediating the onset of sexual behavior, the specificity, time-course, and dose-response relationship of LRF-facilitated lordosis behavior were determined. Ovariectomized female rats, pretreated with estrone and LRF, displayed a pattern of lordosis behavior which differed little from that produced by estrone-progesterone. Little if any lordosis behavior was observed in response to LRF alone, estrone alone, or estrone in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyrotropin-releasing factor (<e>TRF</e>). Furthermore, LRF-induced lordosis behavior occurred in the absence of the adrenals, thus eliminating adrenal progesterone as a factor in facilitating the appearnce of lordosis behavior. The LRF-facilitated lordosis behavior was seen 2 h after the injection of LRF and was maintained for a total of 8 h. A minimal dose of 150 ng LRF was required to initiate the first consistent appearance of lordosis behavior; the maximum response was obtained with 500 ng. It is thus suggested that LRF is not only responsible for the ovulatory discharge of LH and subsequent ovulation, but may also play a role in the initiation of the onset of mating behavior in the female rat.The action of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LRF) in the induction of lordosis behavior in ovariectomized rats (OVX) is described.  139 sexually experienced Sprague-Dawley female rats were ovariectomized at 80-100 days of age and behavioral testing was done 2-3 weeks later.  At 9-10 months after ovariectomy adrenals were removed from 16 rats.  These animals were given free access to isotonic NaCl solution.  Female sexual behavior was expressed as the ratio of the number of lordosis responses to the number of mounts by the male rat.  Ovarian hormones (estrone, E;  theelin in oil 1 mg/ml) and progesterone (P;  lipolutin in oil 50 mg/ml) were used.  The pituitary hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and releasing factors LRF and TRF were dissolved in physiological saline.  All hormones were injected sc.  In Experiment 1 to determine the specificity of LRF-induced lordosis responses 16 rats were tested under 8 conditions.  Each rat was pretreated with either .25 ng E or 500 ng LRF.  Tests for sexual receptivity were conducted 50 hours after E injections.  After repeating these tests, adrenal removals (ADX) were done.  After 5 days, the E-primed OVX-ADX animals were tested for sexual receptivity 50 hours following an injection of LRF (48 hours after E).  In Experiment 2, to determine the time course for the initial appearance of lordosis and the total period of receptivity induced, 24 E-primed OVX rats were tested throughout and 8-hour period following the LRF injections.  Each animal was primed with E at zero hour and given LRF at 48 hours.  49 hours after E injections tests were begun and continued at hourly intervals.  This sequence was repeated at least 4 times.  In Experiment 3, to determine the dose of LRF needed, 99 E-primed OVX rats were injected with doses ranging from 50 to 4000 ng LRF at 48 hours after E injections.  Sexual receptivity tests were done 2 hours later.  Results showed that sexual behavior in the female rat is dependent on the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone.  Synthetic LRF exerted a facilitatory effect on the lordosis response.  The LRF-facilitatory behavior was shown to be specific but LRF alone did not lead to mating behavior in OVX females.  E-priming was a necessary condition to obtain a hgih level of copulatory behavior.  The LRF-induced lordosis pattern was independent of adrenal progesterone and apparently not mediated by pituitary hormones.  The time lag between LFR injection and induction of sexual behavior suggests that this is not a simple monosynaptic mechanism but may involve intermediate steps such as the activation of protein synthesis in the postsynaptic neurons of the mating center.",M1

8244211,"[Cytokine and inflammation: role of IL-5 and its receptor system in inflammation]The inflammatory response is mediated by various cytokines. IL-5 is one of the inflammatory cytokines. The study of IL-5 has its origins in the search for one of the B-cell differentiation factors, named T-cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), that induces antigen-stimulated B cells to differentiate into antibody-forming cells. Eosinophil-differentiation factor, EDF, is a factor produced by thoracic duct lymphocytes of parasite-infected rats. cDNA cloning and mAb against IL-5 enable us to identify this molecule as a cytokine (TRF/EDF) that has pleiotropic activity on various target cells besides B cells and eosinophils. The pleiotropic activity of IL-5 is directly dependent on the initial binding to the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) on the target cell surface. IL-5 transduces its signals through high affinity IL-5R which is constructed by two distinct polypeptides, alpha and beta. IL-5R alpha binds IL-5 with low affinity and associates with the beta chain which can convert low affinity IL-5R to high affinity IL-5R. IL-5R beta that does not bind IL-5 by itself is essential for the IL-5 signaling and is shared among IL-5R, IL-3R, and GM-CSFR. These results imply why IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF are eosinophylopoietin. The truncated IL-5R alpha and IL-5R beta complexes can not transduce IL-5 signals, although they bound IL-5 with high affinity, suggesting that IL-5-specific signaling may be transduced through IL-5R alpha.",M2
2025616,"The role of interleukin 4 in specific antibody responses by human B cells.This study was designed to investigate the requirement for interleukin 4 (IL-4) in specific antibody responses by human lymphocytes. Addition of IL-4 to antigen (influenza virus)-stimulated cultures of tonsillar mononuclear cells was found to suppress specific antibody production significantly at doses as low as 10 units/ml. Specific immunoglobulin (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies were all equally inhibited by IL-4. Inhibition of the antibody response with IL-4 was completely abrogated by an IL-4 blocking antibody showing that the effect was specific for IL-4. It was also found that anti-IL-4 did not inhibit specific antibody production, showing that IL-4 was not required for responses to antigen. In contrast, significant inhibition was obtained with anti-Tac, indicating an important role for IL-2. In the absence of T helper cells antibody responses to influenza virus were completely restored with T cell replacing factor [<e>TRF</e>; IL-2 or low-molecular-weight B cell growth factor (BCGFlow)], but not with IL-4. In fact, IL-4 significantly suppressed the antibody response obtained when either IL-2 or BCGFlow was used as a TRF. Addition of IL-4 at different times after in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL-2 showed that the inhibitory activity of IL-4 was maximal during the first 3 days of culture and was lost by day 4. IL-4 therefore seems to inhibit an early activation event (possibly dependent on IL-2 or BCGFlow), or B cell proliferation essential for specific responses to antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
2215480,"Structural comparison of murine T-cell (B151K12)-derived T-cell-replacing factor (IL-5) with rIL-5: dimer formation is essential for the expression of biological activity.T-cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>)/IL-5 is a T-cell-derived glycoprotein which has pleiotropic activity on lymphoid and myeloid cells. IL-5 polypeptide translated into Xenopus oocytes are heterogeneous in molecular size (40,000 to 60,000 under nonreducing conditions) and yields a monomeric form (Mr of 25,000 to 30,000) under reducing conditions (J. Immun., 140, 1175-1181, 1988). We purified T-cell-derived TRF and rIL-5 using anti-TRF/IL-5 antibody-coupled affinity column from supernatants of a T-cell hybridoma B151K12 and supernatants of HeLa cells, respectively, which had been transfected with murine IL-5 cDNA, and determined their partial N-terminal amino acid sequence (27 residues for B151-TRF and 13 residues for rIL-5). A single amino acid sequence of each sample obtained beginning from methionine that was identical to that predicted from IL-5 cDNA. This finding supports the notion that secreted B151-TRF polypeptide consists of 113 amino acids. Purified B151-TRF supported eosinophilopoiesis of human bone marrow cells as effective as mouse rIL-5 and human rIL-5. B151-TRF competitively inhibited 35S-labeled rIL-5 binding to target cells to the same extent at rIL-5. Treatment of purified rIL-5 and B151-TRF with reducing reagents such as 2-ME, sodium borohydride or dithiothreitol produced a monomeric form of IL-5 which did not exert a biological activity. Reduction and alkylation of rIL-5 caused the loss of binding to its target cells. These results strongly suggest that B151-TRF exists as a homodimer and its primary structure and secondary structures are identical to those of rIL-5. Moreover, the formation of inter-molecular disulfide bond(s) linked by two pairs of cystein residues is essential for the expression of the biological activity of mouse IL-5.",M2
2518658,"Interferon-gamma inhibits the proliferation but not the differentiation of murine B cells in response to IL-5.Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is supposed to be produced by type 1 helper T cells (TH1) and inhibits IL-4-dependent B cell growth and differentiation. IL-5 (T cell-replacing factor, <e>TRF</e>), is a T cell-derived lymphokine which is predominantly produced by type 2 helper T cells (TH2) and regulates proliferation and differentiation of activated B cells. In this study, the effect of IFN-gamma on IL-5-dependent B cell growth and differentiation has been studied using murine chronic B cell leukemic cells (BCL1), normal splenic B cells, and cloned early B cell line. IFN-gamma selectively inhibits the IL-5-mediated proliferation of activated B cells as well as cloned early B cell lines at a low concentration (2 U/ml) in which polyclonal IgM production was not affected. This inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma occurs within 24 h after the onset of culture, as demonstrated by the inability of antibody to IFN-gamma to reverse totally the IFN-gamma-mediated suppressive effects if it was added later than 24 h after the onset of the culture. On the contrary, IL-5-mediated IgM secretion of BCL1 and IgA formation of LPS-stimulated normal B cells were relatively resistant to the suppressive effect of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma does not affect the receptor expression for IL-5. Interestingly, IL-4-mediated IgG1 formation of LPS-stimulated B cells was markedly suppressed by IFN-gamma at 10 U/ml. These results strongly suggest that IFN-gamma may have differential effects on IL-5-mediated B cell triggering.",M2
3263924,"Interleukin 2 and low molecular weight B cell growth factor are T cell-replacing factors for different subpopulations of human B cells.Both recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL 2) and low molecular weight B cell growth factor (BCGFlow) were shown to be T cell-replacing factors (<e>TRF</e>) in specific antibody responses to influenza virus by human blood and tonsillar B cells. When B cells were separated into high and low-density populations on Percoll gradients at 1.074 kg/l, IL 2 was found to act as a TRF only on the low-density B cells, whereas BCGFlow was a TRF for high-density B cells with a lesser effect on low-density B cells. Both populations of B cells responded well in the presence of T cells. The high-density B cells could not be activated to respond to IL 2 by either IL 1, rhIL 4 or by a CD22 monoclonal antibody known to enhance B cell activation. In contrast, a 24-h preincubation with T cells and antigen appeared to prime high-density B cells to respond to IL 2. These results show that high-density B cells can in fact respond to TRF, and that IL 2 and BCGFlow act on different populations of B cells which may be defined by prior exposure to T cells.",M2

3262707,"Receptors for T cell-replacing factor/interleukin 5. Specificity, quantitation, and its implication.T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>)/IL-5 is a glycosylated polypeptide that acts as a key factor for B cell growth and differentiation. Since IL-5 action is probably mediated by specific cell surface receptor(s), we have characterized the binding of IL-5 to cells using biosynthetically [35S]methionine-labeled IL-5 and 125I-IL-5 that had been prepared using Bolton-Hunter reagent. The radiolabeled IL-5 binds specifically to BCL1-B20 (in vitro line) (a murine chronic B cell leukemic cell line previously shown to differentiate into IgM-secreting cells in response to IL-5) within 10 min at 37 degrees C. There are two classes of binding sites with high affinity (Kd = 66 pM) and low affinity (Kd = 12 nM) for IL-5 and an average number of binding sites for high affinity and for low affinity were 400 and 7,500 per cell, respectively. The specificity of binding of radiolabeled IL-5 has been confirmed by demonstrating that only unlabeled IL-5 and anti-IL-5 mAb but not by IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF inhibit radiolabeled IL-5 binding to BCL1-B20 cells. Treatment of surface-bound radiolabeled IL-5 with bivalent crosslinkers identified a membrane polypeptide of Mr 46,500 to which IL-5 is crosslinked. A variety of cell types have been surveyed for the capacity to bind specifically radiolabeled IL-5 with high affinity. BCL1 cells MOPC104E (murine myeloma cell line) expressed IL-5-R, whereas BAL. 17 and L10 A (B cell lymphoma) did not. T cell line, mastocytoma cell line, or macrophage tumor cell line did not display detectable levels of IL-5-R. were hardly detectable on normal resting B cells but were expressed on LPS-activated B cells, fitting the function of IL-5 that acts on activated B cells for their differentiation into Ig-secreting cells. Intriguingly, early B cell lines (J-87 and T-88) that grow in the presence of IL-5 expressed significant but low numbers of high-affinity binding sites for IL-5. The biological effects of IL-5 were mediated by high-affinity binding sites. The identification and characterization of IL-5-R should provide new insight into the apparent diverse biological activities of IL-5.",M2
3260684,"Biological characterization of T cell-replacing factor in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients.The synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) contains a biologically active factor which has the ability to replace T cells for the induction of antibody secretion by human blood lymphoid cells stimulated by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in vitro. This factor, which will be referred to as RA-SF (synovial fluid), also has the capacity to act as a B cell-stimulatory factor of mouse splenic lymphocytes in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using a test system developed for the definition of interleukin 4 (IL-4), which is a B cell-stimulating lymphokine which preferentially activates the synthesis of selected Ig classes in mouse lymphoid cells, we have shown that RA-SF has properties similar to IL-4 in that it induces differentiation of antibody secretion in the LPS-pretreated mouse cell, but unlike IL-4, which gives IgG1 and IgE, it selectively induces IgG2b synthesis. The present study demonstrates that RA-SF has a biological activity that is reminiscent of other B cell-stimulating mouse lymphokines, but it is biologically distinct from IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5. Recent data also indicate that it is distinct from gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Therefore, we conclude that the biological activity of RA-SF has properties in common with a T-cell replacing (<e>TRF</e>) and B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF) and probably represents yet another biological activity which so far lacks an experimental counterpart. The relevance of this factor for autoantibody synthesis is discussed.",M2

IL-5 as an eosinophil chemotactic factor.The recent molecular cloning of the complementary DNA encoding T cell--replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) has demonstrated that a single molecule is responsible for B cell growth factor II (BCGF-II) activity and eosinophil differentiation activity. It has been proposed that this molecule be called interleukin 5 (IL-5). We previously reported that purified rIL-5 supports the terminal differentiation and proliferation of eosinophilic precursors. In this study, we examined the effects of IL-5 on functional activities of mature eosinophils. IL-5 maintained the viability of mature eosinophils obtained from peritoneal exudate cells of mice infected with parasites. It also induced superoxide anion production in a dose-dependent manner. The Boyden's chamber Millipore assay revealed that IL-5 had a marked chemokinetic effect on eosinophils in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-5 was found to be an eosinophil chemotactic factor by the checkerboard assay. In conclusion, IL-5 is suggested to play an important role in increasing the functional activities of eosinophils as well as their production in allergic and parasitic diseases.",M2
3257906,"Glucocorticosteroid-induced immunoglobulin production requires intimate contact between B cells and monocytes.Glucocorticosteroid (GCS)-induced immunoglobulin (Ig) production in vitro is dependent on the functions of T cells and monocytes. T cells produce a replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>-S) which, with monocytes and a broad spectrum of concentrations (both above and below the physiologic range) of GCS, stimulates B cells to synthesize Ig. TRF-S is produced by T cells in cultures of mononuclear cells in the absence of stimulation over the initial 72 hr in culture. T cells, however, require the presence of monocytes or small quantities of interleukin 1 in order for the synthesis of TRF-S to occur. In addition to their role in stimulating TRF-S production, monocytes are also required in cultures of B cells responding to GCS and the cytokine. These experiments demonstrate that this monocyte function cannot be replaced by IL-1 or crude supernatants of monocyte cultures. Furthermore, exposure of TRF-S containing supernatants to oxidizing conditions does not alter the dependence of the cytokine on monocytes or GCS. Coculture of B cells and monocytes separated by a permeable membrane demonstrated that the influence of monocytes on GCS-induced Ig production is unlikely to be mediated by stable soluble factors. Thus, GCS-induced Ig production requires intimate contact between monocytes and B cells in the form of surface contact or unstable soluble mediators.",M2

Based on the diverse activities of rTRF on different target cells, we proposed that TRF be called IL-5. In this study, the molecular characteristics of TRF/IL-5 prepared by rDNA technology and TRF/IL-5 mRNA expression in various T cell lines and normal T cells have been studied. Specific immunoassay showed that rTRF/IL-5, which is transiently translated in vitro by rabbit reticulocyte lysate, has an apparent m.w. of 14,000. By contrast, active forms of rTRF/IL-5 translated in Xenopus oocytes has an apparent m.w. of 45,000 to 50,000 in the nonreducing condition and migrates to the m.w. of 25,000 to 30,000 under the reducing condition, indicating that active form of rTRF/IL-5 consists of dimer forms. The rTRF/IL-5 does not show detectable levels of IL-2, IL-3, and B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (IL-4) activities. Northern blot hybridization of poly (A)+ RNA from constitutively TRF-producing B151K12 T cell hybridoma revealed a single 1.7-kb band hybridizing to the cloned murine TRF/IL-5 cDNA. The expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA in B151K12 was augmented by the stimulation with PMA plus calcium ionophore. In contrast, neither thymoma BW5147 nor IL-2-producing T cell hybridoma A55, both of which produced an undetectable level of TRF, expressed detectable levels of TRF/IL-5 mRNA. Stimulation of EL 4 and D9 cells with PMA and Con A, respectively, induced an increase in the levels of TRF/IL-5 mRNA expression accompanied by TRF/IL-5 production, whereas both cell lines did not show significant gene expression in the absence of the stimulation. In spleen cells from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-primed mice, significant expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA was detected only when the cells were stimulated with relevant Ag, PPD. Normal spleen cells stimulated with Con A showed a significant, but approximately four-fold less expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA. Molecular and functional properties of TRF/IL-5 will be discussed.",M2

HPLC-purified TRF from Sup of a murine TRF-producing B151 cell is an acidic glycoprotein, exerts BCGF II activity and induces expression of IL-2 receptors. It does not show IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, BSF-1/IL-4, or IFN gamma activity. We prepared monoclonal TB13 and NC17 antibodies against HPLC-purified B151-TRF which are specific for and can inhibit TRF as well as BCFG II activity of B151-TRF. Moreover, TB13 as well as NC17 antibody can immunoprecipitate the 46 Kd molecule from B151 Sup which exerts TRF as well as BCGF II activity. Complementary DNA (pSP6K-mTRF23) encoding for murine TRF/IL-5 was cloned and its entire nucleotide sequences were determined. The murine TRF/IL-5 cDNA encodes 133 amino acids including N-terminal strongly hydrophobic regions. Secreted recombinant TRF/IL-5 (apparent m.w. of 46 Kd) has 113 amino acid residues and also comprises homodimers of a molecule with an apparent m.w. of 25 to 30 Kd. TRF/IL-5 mRNA is constitutively expressed in constitutively TRF-producing B151 and is inducible in some T cell lines upon stimulation with PMA or Con A. TRF/IL-5 mRNA is also expressed in Tbc-primed T cells upon the stimulation with PPD, whereas its expression is not effectively induced in non-primed spleen cells by stimulation with Con A or PMA plus calcium ionophore. The translation product of murine TRF/IL-5 cDNA triggers resting as well as activated (DNP-primed or LPS-stimulated) murine B cells for terminal differentiation into Ig-secreting cells (IgM, IgG1, or IgA) accompanied by increased mRNA expression for secreted forms of relevant Ig heavy chain (mu, gamma, or alpha). Among these, increases in the level of mu, and alpha-specific mRNA for the secreted form of IgM and IgA, respectively, are prominent. Moreover, TRF/IL-5 induces maturation of resting B cells into IgM-secreting cells. TRF/IL-5 promotes growth of activated B cells as well as BCL1 cells. TRF/IL-5 is, therefore, a growth as well as a differentiation inducing factor for B cells. Moreover, it induces functional IL-2 receptors on resting as well as activated B cells, besides TRF and BCGF II activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M2
3280472,"Role of recombinant interleukin-1 compared to recombinant T-cell replacing factor/interleukin-5 in B-cell differentiation.The B-cell differentiation-inducing activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1) was compared with that of T-cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>)/interleukin-5 (IL-5), which was originally described as a late-acting B-cell differentiation-inducing factor. Human recombinant IL-1 and murine recombinant TRF/IL-5 were used in this study. Purified B cells from non-primed or antigen-primed mice, LPS-stimulated B-cell blasts, and chronic B-cell leukaemia (BCL1) cells were used as the responding B-cell population. Addition of IL-1 to the culture of normal B-cells and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) induced a dose-dependent anti-SRBC IgM response, with maximal response at 100 U/ml, whereas the response induced by TRF/IL-5 was less than that induced by IL-1 and did not reach the maximum even at 100 U/ml. Addition of anti-IL-1 antibody, but not anti-TRF/IL-5 antibody or anti-IL-2 receptor antibody, inhibited IL-1-induced anti-SRBC responses. Depletion of cells adherent to Sephadex beads from splenic B cells showed no significant effect on the magnitude of the total responses. IL-1 could induce little, if any, differentiation in antigen-primed B cells, LPS-stimulated B-cell blasts, or BCL1 cells into antibody-secreting cells, whereas differentiation could be induced by low doses of TRF/IL-5 (1-2 U/ml). Of great interest is that suboptimal doses of IL-1 (10 U/ml) could synergize with TRF in the primary anti-SRBC PFC responses. Kinetic studies revealed that IL-1 acts on B cells for the first 2 days and TRF/IL-5 for the last 3 days in 5-day cultures of B cells. These results suggest that IL-1 acts primarily on resting B cells as a differentiation-inducing factor in the presence of antigen, and also acts as a 'priming' factor for TRF/IL-5.",M2
2959615,"Specific antibody responses by high- and low-density human peripheral blood B cells: T-helper cells and T-cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) act on different B-cell subpopulations.Antibody production to influenza A strain virus X31 (H3N2) was measured in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with either antigen (X31) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). With some donors, X31 antibody was produced in response to antigenic stimulation, but not as part of the polyclonal response to PWM, suggesting that antigen and PWM may be acting on different B-cell subpopulations. To test this hypothesis, T-cell depleted PBMC (E-) cells were fractionated on discontinuous Percoll gradients and assayed for antibody production in response to antigen or PWM. Fraction I (FrI = SG less than 1.070) cultured in the presence of T cells responded well to PWM, but not at all to X31. FrII (1.070 less than SG less than 1.075) and FrIII (SG greater than 1.075) cultured in the presence of T cells both responded well to X31, but only the medium-density B cells (FrII) were able to make specific antibody when T cells were replaced with T-cell replacing factor (TRF). Specific X31 antibody responses by medium- and high-density B cells (FrII and FrIII) were suppressed equally by the addition of allogeneic T-suppressor (Ts) cells. When allo-activated Ts cells were inactivated by irradiation, allogeneic T-helper (Th) cells were able to collaborate with both FrII and FrIII B cells in specific antibody responses to X31. Since TRF was not able to substitute for T cells in specific antibody responses by FrIII B cells, this result shows that allogeneic T-cell help was not mediated by non-specific 'allogeneic effect' factors and apparently requires cognate T cell-B cell interactions.",M2
2957215,"Analysis of T cell-replacing factor-like activity: potent induction of T helper activity for human B cells by residual concanavalin A and interleukin 2.At least two factors with the capacity to induce IgM synthesis in human B cells were found to be present in the 15-20-kDa fraction of the supernatant of mononuclear cells activated with concanavalin A (Con A) and phorbol ester. Previously, it has been shown (Sauerwein, R. W. et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1985. 15: 611) that interleukin 2 (IL2) in this material is able to induce T cell-dependent IgM secretion in normal B cells. Evidence was obtained for the presence of another factor distinct from IL2 that could replace T cells in the induction of B cell differentiation. We have analyzed this factor with the use of a neoplastic B cell population of prolymphocytic origin that was functionally nonresponsive to IL2. T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>)-like activity and IL2 could be separated by ion-exchange chromatography, although a small amount of IL2 was recovered in the TRF fractions. This small amount of IL2 was found to be crucial for the observed TRF activity. Moreover, a substantial amount of monomeric Con A was detected in the TRF preparation. Our studies show that Con A in the presence of IL2 can act as a potent inducer of helper function in lower numbers of T cells for normal and neoplastic B cells. Functional assays for T cell contamination in B cell suspensions are therefore of limited value because they are determined by the efficiency of the stimulating signal. Particularly in those B cell factor preparations, obtained from mitogen-activated T cells with an obligatory or unidentified role of IL2, the possible effect of a contaminating mitogen must be considered.",M2

In the present study, we examined the role of TRF/IL-5 in the increase in the levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor expression on activated B-cells. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified TRF/IL-5 (B151-TRF) from TRF-producing T-cell hybridoma, B151K12, as well as recombinant TRF/IL-5 (rec-TRF) were used for the analysis. Maximum anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgG antibody response of DNP-primed B-cells or polyclonal IgM secretion of B-cell tumor line BCL1 was seen when HPLC-purified B151-TRF was added or when suboptimal doses of B151-TRF were added to the culture in the presence of IL-2. Normal resting B-cells gave maximum anti-SRBC IgM PFC responses when HPLC-purified B151-TRF and IL-2 were present. The purified B151-TRF as well as rec-TRF also induced on B-cells increased expression of IL-2 receptors that react with monoclonal anti-murine IL-2 receptor antibody, PC61, and 125I-labelled IL-2. The numbers of functional high affinity IL-2 receptors on activated B cells increased at least 20-fold by culturing them with purified B151-TRF. Moreover, B151-TRF induced increase in the levels of steady-state mRNA for IL-2 receptor by approximately 8-fold. These results suggest that activated B-cells as well as BCL1-cells may express functional IL-2 receptors or closely related molecules when stimulated with HPLC-purified B151-TRF as well as rec-TRF.",M2

Inhibition was linearly dependent on the concentration of both TB13 and TRF. Monoclonal antibody TB13 did not inhibit the activities of B-cell stimulatory factor 1, interleukin 1, interleukin 2, or interleukin 3. TRF activity in dissolved samples of immunoprecipitates obtained with TB13 was recovered after NaDodSO4/PAGE, in the fractions corresponding to a protein band at Mr 46,000.

TRF has been defined as a T-cell-derived lymphokine that acts on activated B cells as a B-cell differentiation factor. We have previously demonstrated that TRF is identical to BCGF II and induces expression of receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) on activated B cells. We also have reported that KHF can induce not only expression of IL-2 receptors on peanut agglutinin-binding (PNA+) thymocytes but also generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in PNA+ thymocytes in the presence of IL-2. We show here that culture supernatants of T-cell hybridomas that produce TRF as well as TRF purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC-TRF) have KHF activity and generate CTL in PNA+ thymocytes in the presence of stimulator cells and IL-2. Moreover, translation products (recombinant TRF) of Xenopus oocytes injected with cDNA encoding for murine TRF (BCGF II) also exert KHF activity. A rat monoclonal anti-TRF antibody TB13 can block generation of CTL by HPLC-TRF or recombinant TRF.

2952710,"Antibodies to the common leukocyte antigen (T200) inhibit an early phase in the activation of resting human B cells.T191, a monoclonal antibody reactive with the T200 common leukocyte antigen, profoundly inhibits an early event(s) associated with alpha-immunoglobulin M (alpha IgM)/T cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) or alpha IgM/recombinant interleukin 1 and 2 (rIL 1 and rIL 2)-induced tonsillar B cell proliferation. Kinetic analysis of T191-mediated inhibition indicated that the antibody exerts its effect within 12 to 24 hr of the initiation of cultures and rapidly loses its activity thereafter. Small resting B cells are most sensitive to T191 inhibition, whereas B cells with increasing buoyant density (presumably reflecting stages of increased activation) become progressively T191 insensitive. Analysis of RNA synthesis subsequent to alpha IgM crosslinking of surface immunoglobulin demonstrated that T191 reduced [3H]uridine incorporation by up to 38% during the first 20 hr of culture. In contrast to the effects seen with alpha IgM stimulated B cells, T191 had no inhibitory effect upon phorbol myristate acetate-induced B cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect upon B cell proliferation observed with T191 is not unique among other alpha-T200 antibodies. Four of five previously described alpha-T200 monoclonal antibodies had similar inhibitory effects (82 to 57% maximum inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation). However, 13.3, an alpha-T200 monoclonal antibody previously shown to block natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing was without effect. Likewise, those antibodies capable of inhibiting B cell proliferation failed to block NK-mediated cytolysis. Antibody binding experiments together with proliferation inhibition studies suggest that all of the monoclonal antibodies tested recognized distinct epitopes on the T200 antigen. Both observations are of significance because they demonstrate that the effects seen with anti-T200 antibodies represent an interference with highly specific functional regions on the T200 molecules.",M2

In this study, the role of TRF in the expression of mRNA for both IgM and IgG1 class was investigated. The TRF was purified from cellfree supernatants from a T cell hybridoma, B151K12. RNA was isolated from chronic B cell leukemia (BCL1) cells, DNP-KLH-primed B cells, or normal B cells cultured with or without LPS, and LPS plus TRF or LPS plus BSF-1. The steady state level of isotype-specific mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis with a mu-specific or a gamma 1-specific probe. It was demonstrated that BCL1 and purified B cells cocultured with TRF expresses increased levels (twofold and fourfold, respectively) of secreted forms of mu mRNA. Purified B cells from DNP-KLH-primed mice also expressed increased levels (twofold to fourfold) of mu as well as gamma 1 mRNA for secreted form by stimulation with TRF. Total expression of mu mRNA, however, was approximately threefold higher than that of gamma 1 mRNA. The stimulation of normal B cells with LPS plus TRF induced an increase in the levels of mu mRNA and gamma 1 mRNA expression, fourfold and threefold, respectively. However, the levels of gamma 1 mRNA expression was one-third of that induced in B cells stimulated with LPS plus BSF-1. These results indicate that TRF preferentially induces increased levels of secreted type of mu mRNA and induces less gamma 1 mRNA than BSF-1. The differential role of TRF from BSF-1 in the expression of Ig mRNA will be discussed.",M2
3024009,"Cloning of complementary DNA encoding T-cell replacing factor and identity with B-cell growth factor II.Proliferation and maturation of antigen-stimulated B cells are regulated by several soluble factors derived from macrophages and T cells. These soluble factors are functionally divided into two groups: B-cell growth factor (BCGF), thought to be involved in B-cell proliferation; and B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF), responsible for maturation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. This classification needs to be re-examined in the light of the recent cloning of complementary DNA encoding IgG1 induction factor (interleukin-4, IL-4) from the 2.19 mouse T-cell line. Recombinant IL-4 has BCGF and BCDF activities and affects B cells, T cells and mast cells (refs 7, 8; our unpublished data). Another well-characterized B-cell factor is T-cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), which, when secreted by the murine T-cell hybridoma B151K12, is defined by two activities: induction of IgM secretion by BCL1 leukaemic B-cell line; and induction of secondary anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis in vitro by DNP-prime B cells. Although TRF from B151K12 was classified as BCDF, purified TRF has BCGF-II activity. To elucidate the molecular properties of TRF we isolated cDNA encoding TRF from the 2.19 T-cell line and report here the structure and multiple activities of this lymphokine.",M2
3489671,"Monoclonal antibody NIM-R3 substitutes for B-cell growth factor.A rat monoclonal antibody (NIM-R3) was found to be reactive with activated mouse B cells but neither activated T cells nor small resting lymphocytes, T or B. The antibody stains antibody-forming cell precursors within 48 hr of primary or secondary immunization in vivo, but not at longer times (greater than 14 days) immunization. When added to cultures of spleen cells responding in vitro to dinitrophenylated bovine, IgG, the number of antibody-forming cells was increased. NIM-R3 also maintained the proliferation of purified B blasts in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, but did not activate small resting B cells in the presence of anti-Ig. NIM-R3 could replace B-cell growth factor (BCGF II) in cultures of the murine B-cell lymphoma BCL1 inducing proliferation but not differentiation. Finally, competition was demonstrated for binding sites on BCL1 cells between BCGF II and NIM-R3, but not between NIM-R3 and T-cell replacing factor (B15-<e>TRF</e>). We suggest that NIM-R3 may represent a novel specificity and may be directed against the cell surface receptor for BCGF II, and in turn this receptor may be independent of the B15-TRF and BSF1 receptors.",M2
3088104,"T cell replacing factor for steroids (<e>TRF</e>-S): a 40,000 dalton protein produced by a T4+ T cell.The induction of polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis by glucocorticosteroids (GCS) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes is dependent on both T cells and monocytes. T cells can be replaced by a cytokine, T cell replacing factor for steroids (TRF-S), which promotes GCS-induced Ig production. T cells produce the cytokine when cultured with intact monocytes, with 24 hr monocyte supernatants, or with small quantities (0.1 U/ml or more) of highly purified interleukin 1 (IL 1). TRF-S was produced by isolated T4+ cells, whereas isolated T8+ cells were unable to help GCS-induced Ig synthesis. High pressure liquid chromatography with a gel permeation column revealed a single locus of activity that corresponded to an apparent m.w. of 40,000. At the dilutions utilized in culture, supernatants containing optimal TRF-S activity (3 U/ml final concentration in culture) were found to have less than 0.2 U/ml (final concentration) of interleukin 2 (IL 2) activity. Neither recombinant IL 2 nor recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) over a broad range of concentrations was able to reproduce the capacity of TRF-S to induce the development of Ig-secreting cells with GCS. Thus, we report that TRF-S is synthesized primarily by T4+ T cells, and that its production is stimulated by small concentrations of IL 1. The apparent m.w. of TRF-S is 40,000, and its biological activity is distinct from that of IL 1, IL 2, and IFN-gamma.",M2
3091711,"T-cell replacing factor activity of recombinant-derived interleukin-2 requires gamma-interferon.In this study we show that recombinant-derived human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) has potent T-cell replacing activity in antigen-driven murine antibody responses of T-depleted spleen cells. This T-cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) effect of rIL-2 is antigen specific. By the use of a variety of antibodies to gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), including antibody from an interspecies hybridoma, we demonstrate that this TRF activity depends upon the production of IFN-gamma in the responding cell cultures, i.e., antibody to IFN-gamma blocks TRF activity. In addition, we show that the cell-to-cell allogeneic helper effect of T cells for antibody responses is similarly inhibited by antibodies to IFN-gamma. The inhibition of response produced by the antibodies is reversed by the addition of excess rIFN-gamma to the cultures. The results demonstrate that IFN-gamma is a necessary intermediate mediator for TRF activity mediated by IL-2 and also by T-cell-mediated help for B cells. Thus, even recombinant-derived lymphokines have complex secondary levels of action on responding cells. Antibodies to individual lymphokines are clearly a powerful resource to analyze the role of soluble factors in cellular responses.",M2
2937837,"Selective immunomodulation by the antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone. II. Nonspecific adherent suppressor cells derived from mitoxantrone-treated mice.Mitoxantrone exerts a potent suppressive influence upon humoral immune responses. The B cell is a likely target for this inhibitory effect, and we have reported evidence supporting this possibility. The impact of mitoxantrone upon T lymphocyte reactivity was assessed as a second mode of action of this novel antineoplastic drug. TH and TS lymphocyte induction were tested in the in vitro anti-sheep erythrocyte response, and a surprising differential effect of mitoxantrone was observed. Helper activity was abrogated and suppressor function was enhanced. In apparent disagreement with this result, mitoxantrone inhibited the in vivo induction of TS cells using trinitrophenylated spleen cells. Macrophages were investigated as potential mediators of these effects upon immunoregulatory function. Replacement of macrophages in mitoxantrone-treated spleen cell preparations by normal adherent cells allowed the induction and complete expression of TH lymphocyte function. Conversely, replacement of mitoxantrone-treated macrophages with normal adherent cells before induction of TS cells failed to generate TS cell function. Thus, TH cells were resistant and TS cells were completely susceptible to mitoxantrone. Furthermore, supplementation of normal TH cell cultures with splenic macrophages from mitoxantrone-treated mice inhibited the induction of helper function. Production of the lymphokines IL 2 and <e>TRF</e> in mitoxantrone-treated mice was normal. This is consistent with the retention of functional TH cells in drug-treated spleens. Macrophages in the spleens of mitoxantrone-treated mice were responsible for the abrogated helper function and the enhanced suppressor activity. Although TS cell induction was directly inhibited by the drug, the effect upon TH cell function was secondary to the action of mitoxantrone-induced suppressor macrophages. Mitogen-stimulated lymphokine production was normal. Thus, mitoxantrone is a selective immunomodulator. The macrophage-mediated suppression of TH cell induction and humoral immunity investigated in spleens from mitoxantrone-treated mice is an intriguing finding that may have significant implications for immunotherapy.",M2
3485139,"Evidence for existence of two distinct TNP-Ficoll-responsive B cell subpopulations preferentially reactive either to a T cell-replacing factor (B151-<e>TRF</e>) or to a signal from accessory cells.The ability of B cells to respond to TNP-Ficoll has been shown to correlate with their ability to respond to T cell-replacing factor (TRF). The present study analyzed the relationship of TNP-Ficoll-responsive B cells to a TRF-responsive B cell subpopulation. The B cells from normal, unprimed mice responded to TNP-Ficoll in the presence of accessory cells. Such responses were notably augmented by the addition of TRF derived from a monoclonal T cell hybridoma, B151K12(B151-TRF). Interestingly, B cells of mutant X-linked immunodeficient DBA/2Ha which failed to respond to B151-TRF gave anti-TNP PFC responses to TNP-Ficoll comparable to those of normal mice, depending on the presence of accessory cells. However, under this condition, the addition of B151-TRF did not augment the TNP-Ficoll responses. One explanation of the augmentation of TNP-Ficoll response by TRF for the B cells from nondefective mice was that two distinct B cell subpopulations exist which differ in their respective activation requirement for TRF and accessory cells. To examine this possibility, syngeneic accessory cells were pulsed with TNP-Ficoll and were assayed for their ability to activate normal B cells in the presence or absence of B151-TRF. The results revealed that TNP-Ficoll-pulsed accessory cells were able to induce primary anti-TNP PFC responses in normal B cells to the same magnitude as soluble TNP-Ficoll. However, these B cell responses induced by the TNP-Ficoll-pulsed accessory cells were not augmented by the addition of B151-TRF to the culture. These results support the notion that two distinct TNP-Ficoll-responsive B cell subpopulations exist; one requires accessory cell-B cell interaction to be activated by TNP-Ficoll but fails to respond to TRF, and the other can be activated by TRF in a totally accessory cell-independent manner.",M2
2939324,"Effect of passive administration of alloantiserum containing antibody against putative acceptor(s) for T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) in the neonatal stage on development of B cell activity responsive to TRF.Previously, we showed that the antiserum raised in male (DBA/2Ha X BALB/c)F1(DCF1) mice (T cell-replacing factor [TRF]-low response animals) by immunizing them with activated B cells from BALB/c mice (TRF-high-responders) contained antibodies against putative TRF-acceptor site(s). We have now evaluated the hypothesis that neonatal treatment of mice with the above antiserum suppresses the development of B cells responsive to TRF. Male DCF1 mouse anti-BALB/c B-cell antiserum or normal DCF1 mouse serum as a control was injected into BALB/c mice within 24 hr after birth. In the antiserum-treated mice, no augmented primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were observed under the conditions in which markedly augmented IgM anti-SRBC responses were induced in control BALB/c mice, suggesting that development of B cells reacting with male DCF1 mouse anti-BALB/c B-cell antiserum is suppressed by the neonatal treatment with the antiserum. Furthermore, the development of B cell activity responsible for helper factors derived from T cells, such as TRF, was markedly suppressed in the neonatally antiserum-treated mice, whereas activity of B cells capable of interacting directly with helper T cells through antigen-bridges was not significantly affected by the same treatment. Such suppression of the B cell activity could be induced only when the antiserum was administered within 48 hr after birth. Moreover, neonatal treatment of mice with the antiserum induced suppressed responsiveness of B cells to a T-independent type 2 antigen, TNP-Ficoll. Neither serum-borne suppressive serum components nor suppressor cells were detected by the system employed. These results support the hypothesis that TRF responsive B cells constitute a subpopulation distinct from the other B cells capable of cooperating with helper T cells via cognate interaction.",M2
2878350,"Establishment of an assay system for the detection of translated materials of T-cell-replacing factor mRNA in Xenopus oocytes.We established an assay system for detecting T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) activity of translated materials in Xenopus oocytes of poly (A)-positive mRNA extracted from a T cell hybrid cell line, B151K12 (B151) which constitutively produces TRF. Since it was difficult to detect TRF activity of the translated products of B151-mRNA, partly because of low TRF activities, we developed the following two systems. First, RNA was prepared from B151 cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and calcium ionophore A23187 because such stimulations augmented TRF production by approximately three to five-fold. Second, interleukin 2 (IL-2, 125 U/ml) was added to the culture of BCL1 cells to detect a small amount of TRF-active materials since IL-2 synergizes with a suboptimal dose of TRF to induce IgM secretion in TRF-responding BCL1 cells (chronic B cell leukemic cells). Here we describe TRF activity of translation products of B151-mRNA in Xenopus oocytes. B151-TRF mRNA was detected in the fractions sedimented between 15 and 18S by analysis using sucrose density gradient centrifugation.",M2
2934318,"Three functionally distinct helper T-cell clones: the roles for antigen non-specific helper factors in B-cell activation through two different pathways.We established three functionally distinct purified protein derivative (PPD)-reactive T-cell clones (B11.15, B12.F and D-2). Clone B11.15 could co-operate with DNP-primed B cells to induce anti-DNP IgG plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses only when high amounts of PPD were added to the culture, whereas stimulation of a low amount of DNP-PPD was ineffective (factor-mediated interaction). On the other hand, clone D-2 activated those B cells in a MHC-restricted manner only when DNP-PPD was added to the culture (cognate interaction). B12.F could stimulate B cells with either PPD or DNP-PPD. Antigen non-specific helper factors (lymphokines) responsible for B-cell activation produced by cloned T cells upon stimulation with PPD and antigen-presenting cells were then investigated. Lymphokine activities determined in the present study were IL-2, BCGF I, BCGF II and <e>TRF</e>. BCGF I activity was determined by proliferation-inducing activity on purified B cells in the presence of anti-IgM antibody. BCGF II activity was measured by proliferation-inducing activity on purified B cells in the presence of dextran sulphate. TRF activity was determined on DNP-primed B cells for inducing further differentiation into anti-DNP IgG PFC. BCGF I active molecules were eluted in the fraction at apparent MW of 50,000-70,000 and 8,000-10,000 in gel-permeation column chromatography.",M2
3897376,"Role of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue on B151K12-derived T cell-replacing factor (B151-<e>TRF</e>) molecule in B cell-receptor binding and -stimulating activity.The role of sugar moiety on T cell-replacing factor molecule derived from a monoclonal T cell hybridoma B151K12 (B151-TRF) was analyzed with respect to the interaction with receptor on B cells. The induction of B cell differentiation into Ig-secreting cells by B151-TRF was specifically inhibited by addition of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) to culture. Such inhibition appeared to be attributed to the interference of GalNAc in the interaction of TRF with its receptor, because absorption of TRF activity with B cells was notably inhibited by the presence of GalNAc. To substantiate this point further, we established binding assay of B151-TRF molecule to the receptor on B cells by using 125I-labeled TRF fraction enriched by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and gel filtration. The results revealed that the binding of 125I-TRF molecule to the B cells was almost completely blocked by GalNAc. Moreover, the existence of GalNAc residue(s) on B151-TRF molecule was evidenced by the facts that 1) the TRF activity was eluted from lectin gels with specificity for GalNAc as revealed by the functional assay, and 2) the 125I-TRF molecule specifically bound to such lectin gels. Thus, the GalNAc residue(s) on B151-TRF molecule plays an important role in binding of TRF molecule to the receptor and in the stimulation of B cells. The molecular properties of B cell-stimulatory B151-TRF and its mode of interaction with corresponding receptor on B cells were discussed in the context of B151-TRF as a glycosylated lymphokine molecule and B151-TRF receptor as a carbohydrate-binding protein (animal lectin).",M2
2934189,"Neutralization of T-replacing factor by T8-positive lymphocytes: an important suppressor mechanism operating in the regulation of polyclonal B-cell activation.Pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced B-cell activation was entirely abrogated by pre-treating peripheral mononuclear cells (PBM) with T4 (anti-T-helper-inducer subset) or T11 (anti-sheep erythrocyte receptor, ie. anti-pan-T-cell) monoclonal antibody plus complement. Immunoglobulin secretion was restored in T11- but not T4- cultures by adding the culture supernatant from PWM-stimulated PBM (T-replacing factor, <e>TRF</e>). Since T8+ (T-suppressor-cytotoxic subset) cells were present in high concentrations in T4- but absent from T11- cultures, it appeared that these cells could inhibit B-cell activation by PWM plus TRF and that suppression could occur in the absence of T4+ cells. Incubation of TRF with purified, unstimulated T8+ cells prior to addition to T11- cultures abrogated subsequent PWM-induced B-cell activation, whereas T8- PBM had no effect on TRF. T8+ cells did not secrete suppressor factors during incubation with TRF. Absorption of one or more of the factors required for B-cell growth and differentiation by T8+ cells appears to be an important suppressor mechanism operating in the PWM system.",M2
3875491,"Antigen-nonspecific T cell-derived factors in B cell activation: differences in the requirements for interleukin 2 in responses of unprimed and primed B cells.The requirements for interleukin 2 (IL2) and other T cell-derived helper factors in the responses of unprimed and antigen-primed B cells to sheep erythrocytes were investigated. Unprimed B cells required both IL2 and additional factor(s), hereafter referred to as T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), in addition to specific antigen, for antibody production. IL2 was required only during the early stages (approximately equal to 24 h) of culture while TRF was necessary only after this time and was then required throughout the remaining culture period. IL2 stimulated the appearance of Thy-1+ cells in unprimed  B cell  populations which could substitute for the function of IL2, implicating an indirect role, at least in part, for IL2 in the TRF assay. Furthermore, in contrast to the results with unprimed B cells, primed B cells required only late-acting TRF for optimal antibody responses. We suggest that IL2 activates residual T cells or precursors of T cells in B cell populations which then function, in the presence of specific antigen, to render B cells receptive to T cell-derived factors which promote B cell growth and differentiation.",M2
3886792,"An examination of the <e>TRF</e> assay reveals a heterogeneity of TRF-like activities.Supernatant from the cloned Mlsa,d-reactive helper T cell line L2V is a potent source of T cell replacing factor (TRF) activity. To determine whether L2V SF was representative of TRF-active supernatants, it was compared with supernatant from Con A-stimulated spleen cells (CASF) by using TRF assays. This analysis, facilitated by the use of four different antigens (R36a, TNP-R36a, SRBC, and HRBC), produced the following results. 1) L2V SF and CASF allowed responses of similar magnitude against either R36a or TNP-R36a; however, CASF always allowed responses of fivefold to 30-fold greater magnitude against SRBC than L2V SF. 2) B cells from xid and  normal  mice will give equally large responses to TNP-R36a when CASF is used as the source of TRF; however, L2V SF will only effect the responses by  normal  B cells. 3) L2V SF-driven responses to R36a and SRBC, and CASF-driven responses to R36a, follow single-hit kinetics and are IL 2 independent, whereas CASF-driven responses to SRBC follow multi-hit kinetics and are IL 2 dependent. These results indicate that the TRF assay measures a heterogeneity of TRF-like activities that can be distinguished according to the supernatant, antigen, and/or B cell responders used. The determination of whether this heterogeneity is due to the number of molecular components of a single  type  of TRF required for each antigen-induced PFC response or to the existence of distinct  types  of TRF is examined.",M2
3872907,"BCGFII activity on activated B cells of a purified murine T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) from a T cell hybridoma (B151K12).Experiments were performed to examine a growth-promoting activity on B cells or B leukemic cells of T cell-replacing factor (TRF) produced by a murine T cell hybridoma (B151K12) which constitutively produces TRF. The cellfree supernatant (CFS) from B151K12 cells (B151-CFS) could induce terminal differentiation of pre-activated B cells or in vivo passaged chronic B leukemia cells, BCL1, into immunoglobulin-secreting cells, while it did not exert a nominal lymphokine activity such as BCGFI (now known as BSFpl), IL 2, or gamma-interferon. However, it promoted [3H]thymidine uptake of dextran sulfate (DXS)-stimulated normal B cells and in vivo passaged BCL1 cells, suggesting that it also has BCGFII activity. We tried extensively to purify and to separate the TRF active molecule from the BCGFII active molecule by using many types of purification procedures. The purification scheme consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Blue-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and gel permeation with fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). It was revealed that the BCGFII active molecule was hardly separable from the TRF during the entire purification procedure. The TRF as well as BCGFII active materials were glycoprotein with an apparent m.w. of 50 to 60 Kd on gel permeation chromatography and 18 Kd on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The BCGFII active materials were hardly separable from the TRF active one, even after a reverse-phase FPLC, in which both BCGFII and TRF activities were recovered in the fractions eluted at 44 to 48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Furthermore, the absorption of TRF and BCGFII active materials by using BCL1 cells removed not only TRF but also BCGFII activity. Moreover, B cell-specific monoclonal antibody (9T1), which can preferentially block TRF-dependent plaque-forming cell responses, also inhibited the expression of BCGFII activity to BCL1 cells. Taking all of the results together, we conclude that the TRF from B151K12 cells promotes growth of appropriately activated, such as DXS-stimulated normal cells and BCL1 tumor cells. These results suggest that B151-TRF may act on B cells as B cell growth and differentiation factors.",M2
2580939,"Obligatory role of gamma interferon in T cell-replacing factor-dependent, antigen-specific murine B cell responses.The role of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) activity for antigen-specific plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses in vitro was studied using antibodies to murine IFN-gamma (Mu IFN-gamma). TRF activity was present in supernatants (Sn) of Con A- or mixed leukocyte reaction-stimulated murine spleen cells as well as in an IL-2-rich fraction of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocyte Sn and in the Sn of the Gibbon T lymphoma MLA-144. The human TRF was highly active with cells from nu/nu mice and normal mice but not with cells from animals with the xid immunologic defect, similar to the activity of murine TRF. Antibodies to IFN-gamma consisted of hyper-immune rabbit antisera, IFN-gamma affinity-purified rabbit immunoglobulin and an interspecies hybridoma specific for Mu IFN-gamma. The results show that the activities of all preparations of TRF are markedly diminished or abrogated by antibody to Mu IFN-gamma but not by antibodies to human IFN-gamma (Hu IFN-gamma), nor by normal rabbit sera or purified rabbit Ig. The degree of inhibition was dose dependent and was quantitatively reversed by the addition to the cultures of recombinant-derived Mu IFN-gamma (Mu rIFN-gamma) but not Hu rIFN-gamma. This reversal was fully antigen specific and thus not attributable to polyclonal B cell activation by IFN-gamma, which is inactive alone in the TRF assay. Kinetic analysis shows that IFN-gamma must act by 24-48 h to produce PFC responses at 4 d. Together, the data demonstrate that IFN-gamma is a necessary mediator for TRF effects and that IFN-gamma is induced by TRF from T-depleted murine spleen cells in sufficient quantity to support large antibody responses. The source of this IFN-gamma may be the potent natural killer cells that are induced in cultures stimulated with TRF.",M2
2857748,"Immunoregulation in the rat: cellular and molecular requirements for B cell responses to types 1, 2, and T-dependent antigens.The requirements for primary in vitro plaque-forming cell (PFC) development in cultures of purified rat splenic B cells have been examined. Rat B cells were directly responsive to the type 1 antigen trinitrophenyl-Brucella abortus (TNP-BA), but both T cells and adherent accessory cells were required for B cell responses to the type 2 antigen TNP-Ficoll and the T cell-dependent (TD) antigen sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). However, the cellfree supernatants from concanavalin A-induced spleen cells of rat or mouse origin replaced the requirement for T cells and macrophages, and resulted in PFC development in response to TNP-Ficoll and SRBC and augmented PFC numbers in response to TNP-BA. Culture supernatants from induced murine T cell and macrophage cell lines were used to partially deduce the molecular requirements for the support of PFC development by rat B cells to these three antigens. Supernatants from the EL-4 (EL-4 sup) and B151 K12 (B15 sup) T cell lines augmented TNP-BA responses, suggesting that B cell growth factor II (BCGF-II) mediated this effect. An admixture of purified interleukin 2 (IL 2) and B15 sup supported PFC development to SRBC; indicating that IL 2, BCGF-II, and the T cell-replacing factor in B15 sup (B15-<e>TRF</e>) were sufficient to support this response. In addition, the IL 2 plus B15 sup-supported anti-SRBC PFC response was increased by the addition of an interleukin 1-containing fraction from the supernatant of the macrophage line P388D1. PFC development in response to TNP-Ficoll had the most stringent requirements and only occurred in the presence of EL-4 sup and B15 sup (IL 2, BCGF-I, BCGF-II, EL-TRF, B15-TRF). These data indicate that different cellular and molecular requirements exist for PFC development in response to types 1, 2, and TD antigens by rat B cells.",M2
3871678,"Maturation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells: correlation between the capacity of responding to T-cell factors in vitro and the stage of maturation reached in vivo.Circulating malignant cells from 15 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were examined by the electron microscope (EM) and tested for their capacity to produce immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules using endogenous labeling techniques in vitro. In agreement with previous observations, B-CLL clones from various patients could be subdivided in three distinct groups: immature (type 1) clones, that comprised mainly small resting lymphocytes which synthesized, but degraded Ig of the secretory type intracellularly; mature (type 3) clones consisting mainly of cells with an extended Golgi apparatus and numerous strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) that secreted Ig molecules; and clones (type 2) at an intermediate maturational stage. When stimulated with T-cell supernatants that contained T-cell replacing factor(s) (<e>TRF</e>), type 3 and, to a lesser extent, type 2 clones differentiated further and secreted increased amounts of Ig. This maturation was not observed when type 1 clones were stimulated with the same supernatants. However, these cells were not incapable of further maturation since they could differentiate in response to phorbol ester (TPA). The present data reinforce the concept that different CLL clones undergo a process of maturation in vivo that may be arrested at different levels and demonstrate that the various clones respond differently to physiological stimuli depending upon the level of maturation already reached in vivo.",M2
2931487,"Regulatory function of Thy-1-negative cells: V. A lymphokine of B cell origin (BEF) induces in vitro high antibody response in genetically selected low responder mice.Studies were conducted on two lines of mice genetically selected, respectively, for high (AB/H) and low (AB/L) antibody production, in order to identify the mechanism by which genes involved in the selection express their functions. It was found that B cell-derived enhancing factor (BEF), a lymphokine of B cell origin which acts on T cells by preventing the activation of suppressor cells, is effective in inducing high responses in low responder mice, whereas it is ineffective in modulating antibody production in high responder mice. As a result, no difference was found between the responses of AB/H and AB/L mice when spleen cells were stimulated in vitro in the presence of BEF. AB/H and AB/L mice do not seem to differ in their B cell functions since no difference was found in the capacity of B cells of either line to synthesize antibodies in the presence of T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), or to produce endogenous BEF. These data indicate that, at least in vitro, the character of general responsiveness of these two mouse lines mainly reflects differential reactivity of T suppressor cells. Since the two lines represent, respectively, the maximal and minimal responsiveness of an outbred population of animals, it is suggested that the individual difference in antibody response is related to individual differences of T suppressor cells in responding to the immunogen.",M2

Two assay systems for TRF activity were employed: 1) induction of anti-DNP IgG PFC responses in cultures of splenic B cells from DNP-KLH-primed BALB/c mice, and 2) induction of IgM PFC in chronic B cell leukemic cells (BCL1). The purification scheme consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Blue-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel permeation with fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Overall, TRF was purified approximately 34,000-fold with a maximum 3.8% recovery of activity, and the specific activity of the purified TRF was approximately 9.6 X 10(4) U/mg. The TRF that is active in these systems is distinct from the other lymphokines such as IL 1, IL 2, BCGFI (now known as BSFp1), and gamma-interferon. The TRF is extremely hydrophobic, with an apparent m.w. of 50,000 to 60,000 on gel permeation chromatography and 18,000 on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Highly purified B151-TRF abrogated the activity by treatment with trypsin but not with RNase. Moreover, it bound to lima bean agglutinin-Sepharose specific for N-acetylgalactosamine residues, indicating that B151-TRF is a glycosylated glycoprotein containing N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The role of N-acetylgalactosamine residues on TRF activity was additionally substantiated by the fact that the addition of appropriate amounts of N-acetylgalactosamine in the assay systems for TRF preferentially induced a profound suppression for TRF-mediated PFC responses.",M2
2578400,"T cell-replacing factor in specific antibody responses to influenza virus by human blood B cells.In man, B cell maturation factors obtained from T cells or T cell lines have been shown to induce antibody formation in mitogen or anti-immunoglobulin activated B cells, and in some continuous B cell lines, but the relationships between these factors and B cell differentiation factors in antigen-specific antibody responses is unclear. We have now shown that supernatants from phytohemagglutinin-activated tonsil cells, or from the Gibbon Ape T cell line MLA-144, can substitute for T cells in the specific antibody response by human blood B cells to influenza virus. Thus, T cell-depleted non-rosette-forming (E-) cells prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells made antibody when cultured with antigen and factor together, whereas control cultures of E- cells with either antigen or factor alone did not. Moreover, E- cells cultured with factor and influenza virus strain A/X31 made antibody to A/X31, but not the non-cross-reacting strain, B/HK (and vice versa) showing that the response was antigen specific. The activity in these supernatants, therefore, fulfilled the functional definition of T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>). The possibility that interleukin 2 (IL 2) present in the TRF-containing supernatants was expanding residual T cells in the E- preparations to provide normal T cell help was excluded in three different ways. First, E- cells depleted of T (Leu4+) cells to undetectable levels made normal amounts of antibody when cultured with antigen and TRF. Secondly, a limiting dilution technique was employed to show that help in cultures of E- cells and TRF was not mediated by antigen-specific T helper cells. Thirdly, TRF-containing supernatants depleted of IL2 retained activity, whereas purified IL2 was inactive. Preliminary purification of TRF by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA54 columns showed that all the activity eluted in a single peak between 35 000 and 43 000 molecular weight. This distinguishes human TRF from IL 2 and from other B cell maturation factors with a molecular weight range of 15 000-20 000 which act on continuous B cell lines. In addition to TRF, supernatants from phytohemagglutinin-activated tonsils also contained a factor which could induce polyspecific IgM production, but only in cultures containing significant numbers of T cells. This additional activity may have been due to IL 2, and provides an explanation for the apparent T cell-dependent effects sometimes observed in experiments designed to test B cell differentiation factors on T cell-depleted normal B cells.",M2
6334231,"Dependence of T-cell-replacing factor and immunogenic dose for the production of monoclonal antibodies using the in vitro immunization technique.Antigen-specific hybridomas can be produced using spleen cells that have been immunized in culture as parental cells in the hybridization step. The in vitro immunization of non-immune mouse spleen cells was supported by a lymphokine preparation that contained T-cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>). The influence of TRF, produced by a mixed-thymocyte reaction, on immunization in culture has been investigated using bacterial cells as the immunogen. The cell vols of stimulated splenocytes were monitored and it was found that the induction of antigen-specific blast cells, which could subsequently be immortalized by fusing them with myeloma cells, was completely abolished in immunizations which were not supported by TRF. If serum-free conditions were used during the in vitro immunization step, the frequency of antigen-specific blast cells increased, which resulted in a higher yield of specific hybridomas. This was due to the reduced background stimulation achieved by omitting serum proteins. The relationship between immunogenic dose and response, measured as the specific efficiency obtained in hybridization experiments with in vitro immunized cells, was recorded using different amounts of sperm whale myoglobin as antigen. An antigen-specific response was recorded with as low as 1 ng antigen/ml.",M2
6425400,"The effect of deoxyguanosine on human lymphocyte function. II. Analysis of the interference with B lymphocyte differentiation in vitro.The differentiation of normal human peripheral blood B lymphocytes into plasma cells in vitro, studied in mononuclear cells stimulated with PWM or in purified B cells stimulated with a T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), can be inhibited by both deoxyguanosine (dGuo) and guanosine. The mechanism underlying this effect, which differs from the in vivo findings in PNP deficiency, was analyzed. dGuo toxicity can be antagonized by hypoxanthine but not by deoxycytidine. PNP-deficient and HGPRT-deficient B lymphocytes are not sensitive to the intoxicating properties of (deoxy)guanosine. Inhibition of PNP activity in normal B lymphocytes by 8-aminoguanosine decreases the sensitivity for dGuo intoxication. Incubation of purified B cells (stimulated with TRF) with dGuo leads to increased intracellular levels of guanosine di- and triphosphate (GDP and GTP), whereas deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) levels remain low. These observations lead to the conclusion that inhibition of B lymphocyte differentiation by dGuo is brought about by one of the end products of the pathway starting with degradation of dGuo by PNP, followed by guanine salvage by HGPRT, and possibly further phosphorylation of GMP into GDP and GTP. According to this mechanism, B lymphocyte differentiation in PNP deficiency is not sensitive to (deoxy)guanosine; because of the absence of PNP activity, these cells cannot accumulate GMP, GDP, and GTP, and therefore escape dGuo intoxication.",M2

TRF is distinct from IL 2 but indistinguishable from polyclonal BCSF.In vitro PFC responses to the thymus-independent (TI) antigen Streptococcus pneumoniae R36a require T cell replacing factor(s) (TRF). This requirement for TRF is as significant as for the thymus-dependent (TD) antigen SRBC. TRF is shown to be distinct from IL 2 by the following observations: 1) culture supernatants from the cloned T cell line L2, collected over an 8-day period after allogeneic stimulation, transiently contain IL 2 activity but maintain high levels of TRF activity throughout 192 hr; 2) L2V, a variant subclone of L2, produces much higher levels of TRF activity than the parental line but no detectable IL 2 activity; 3) the addition of IL2+, TRF- supernatants from the T cell hybridoma FS6-14.13 does not affect the L2V SF-driven PFC responses to R36a or SRBC; and 4) the addition of contaminating T cells to cultures containing T cell-depleted spleen cells, L2V SF, and antigen does not affect the PFC response. TRF does appear to be indistinguishable from polyclonal B cell stimulating factor (BCSF), which stimulates polyclonal PFC responses in the absence of antigen, mitogen, or anti-Ig. The TRF and BCSF activities of L2V SF could not be separated by ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and gel-filtration chromatography. TRF and BCSF have an apparent m.w. of approximately 40,000.",M2
6418795,"Selective elimination of a B cell subset having acceptor site(s) for T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) with biotinylated antibody to the acceptor site(s) and avidin-ricin A-chain conjugate.A covalent conjugate of avidin with ricin subunit A-chain (avidin-RA) was prepared by using N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate as a coupling agent. Selective cytotoxic activity after the combined treatment of spleen cells with biotinylated antibody and avidin-RA was demonstrated by the fact that the responsiveness to LPS was selectively abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (MIg) antibody, but not with biotinylated anti-Thy-1.2 antibody. Neither the biotinylated antibody alone nor avidin-RA alone was effective in decreasing the responses to mitogens. Moreover, a high anti-DNP PFC response elicited by DNP-KLH-primed BALB/c mouse spleen cells stimulated in vitro with DNP-KLH was mostly abrogated by the pretreatment of the cells with biotinylated anti-MIg antibody and avidin-RA. Again, neither the biotinylated antibody alone nor avidin-RA alone was effective in decreasing the anti-DNP PFC response. This cell-killing method with the use of biotinylated antibody and avidin-RA was applied and evaluated in experimental systems in which the helper action of T cells on B cells was mediated by T cell-replacing factor (TRF) or was performed by the direct interaction of T cells with B cells (cognate interaction). When DNP-KLH-primed splenic B cells, pretreated with biotinylated F(ab')2 fragment of DCF1 male anti-BALB/c-B IgG antibody against acceptor site(s) for TRF followed by treatment with avidin-RA, were stimulated with DNP-OVA in the presence of monoclonal TRF, the anti-DNP PFC response was significantly decreased, whereas the same treated B cells responded well to stimulation with DNP-PPD in the presence of Tbc-primed T cells (cognate interaction). These results indicate that B cells responsible for the cognate interaction and those having TRF acceptor site(s) belong to a distinct subpopulation of B cells, and that the cytocidal action of the noncovalent conjugate of the antibody and RA formed from the biotinylated antibody and avidin-RA via an avidin-biotin complex has immunologic selectivity, eliminating only the latter subset of B cells recognized by the antibody.",M2
6605406,"T cell-replacing factor for glucocorticosteroid-induced immunoglobulin production. A unique steroid-dependent cytokine.Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) added to otherwise unstimulated cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) induce the synthesis and secretion of all classes of immunoglobulin. The magnitude of this response is similar to that seen with other polyclonal B cell activators such as pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and like that of PWM, the steroid effect is dependent on both T cells and monocytes. To determine the cellular target for GCS in these cultures, separated populations of T cells and non-T cells were preincubated with steroids and then recombined. No immunoglobulin was produced in any of these preincubation experiments. As a different approach to this question, supernatants were collected from various cell populations following stimulation with PWM, concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), alloantigens, or GCS. These supernatants were tested for their effects on GCS-induced Ig production by B cells. Supernatants from 3-d cultures of unstimulated, as well as GCS-treated, PBMC contained a T cell-replacing factor that permitted T-depleted PBMC to produce Ig upon steroid stimulation. This supernatant factor (<e>TRF</e>-S) could be produced in the absence of steroid stimulation, but both the factor and GCS were necessary for the induction of Ig synthesis. Production of the TRF-S required the presence of both T cells and adherent cells in culture and was found in the highest concentrations at 3-4 d of culture. Supernatants from cultures stimulated with PWM, PHA, Con A, and alloantigens did not contain detectable TRF-S activity, and TRF-S was unable to replace helper T cells for PWM-induced Ig production. TRF-S required the presence of adherent cells in the T cell-depleted responder population for its action. Further, it was effective in inducing Ig production along with GCS in the presence of a sufficient concentration of cyclosporin A to block all T cell helper activity for primary responses of PBMC to PWM or GCS. TRF-S was inactivated by trypsin treatment, heating to 56 degrees C, freezing, lyophilization, and storage at 4 degrees C for greater than 3 wk. Its molecular weight is probably 10,000 daltons or more, since TRF-S activity is not rapidly dialyzable. These experiments indicate that GCS-induced Ig production by human B cells does not require the presence of intact T cells in the cultures and therefore the steroids are not exerting their influence directly on T suppressor or T helper cells. Furthermore, they demonstrate a previously unrecognized cytokine that induces the differentiation of human B cells to Ig production in the presence of GCS.",M2

The target cell of this activity is indisputably shown to be the B cell, which indicates that T cell-derived factors can act directly on B cells. The effect of monoclonal TRF-containing supernatant from the C.C3.11.75 Dennert cell line, (DL)TRF, which demonstrates B cell growth-promoting activity, is to increase the frequency of B cell clones stimulated by mitogens as opposed to increasing B cell clone sizes. (DL)TRF B cell growth enhancement is observed when B cells are activated by fetal calf serum mitogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dextran sulfate (DXS), or LPS + DXS. The growth-promoting activity of (DL)TRF appears to be that of a costimulator rather than a classical growth factor because (DL)TRF alone is not sufficient to maintain clonal growth of activated B lymphoblasts.",M2

Induction of immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis depends on the presence of two additional T cell-derived factors (T cell-replacing factors [TRF]). One TRF, designated B15 1K 12-TRF, is found in the supernatant of B15 1K 12 T hybridoma cells. It is required relatively early in these cultures and appears to cause an increase in cell yield as well as Ig synthesis. The second factor, designated EL-TRF, is found in PMA-induced EL-4 supernatant. It appears to be different from both BCGF and IL 2 in that it can be separated from the former by isoelectric focusing and from the latter by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. EL-TRF is still active if added on the last day of a 4-day culture. A model for the action of anti-IgM and these three T cell-derived factors in B cell activation and differentiation is proposed.",M2

The populations obtained were 95 to 99% pure as determined by immunofluorescence. Graded doses of these T cells were cultured with optimal mitogenic doses of concanavalin A and the 0 to 24 and 24 to 48-hr culture supernatants were collected. The dose-curve assays of the supernatants of Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2- cells showed comparable activity in interleukin 2 (IL 2) and T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), assayed on antigen-stimulated culture of T-depleted spleen cells. Limiting dilution assays of IL 2-secreting precursor cells stimulated by Con A showed a high frequency of precursors in both populations, slightly higher among Lyt-2- cells. The supernatants also contained comparable levels of IPA (inducer of plasminogen activator production by the macrophages), MAF (macrophage-activating factor, assayed by induction of their cytolytic function), and MCGF (mast cells growth factor, assayed on a mast cell line). IPA and MAF were not produced with the same kinetics and in the same T cell concentration conditions as IL 2 and TRF. In contrast, interferon was principally produced by the Lyt-2+ cells.",M2

The clones require media containing a source of interleukin 1 as well as interleukin 2. They retain physiologic responses to interleukin 1, which is required for optimal production of T cell lymphokines by these clones in response to concanavalin A (Con A). The two Ly-1+2- T cell clones differ in their production of lymphokines after stimulation by Con A. The supernatant of clone Ly-1.21 promotes the proliferation of T cells maintained in long-term culture, induces antibody synthesis in cultures of B cells and antigen, and induces the differentiation of cytolytic cells in cultures of thymocytes and antigen; these assays define the properties of T cell growth factor (TCGF), T cell-replacing factor for B cells (<e>TRF</e>-B), and T cell-replacing factor for cytolytic cells (TRF-C), respectively. In contrast, the supernatant of clone Ly-1.14 contains only TCGF activity and does not promote antibody synthesis by B cells or differentiation of cytolytic cells from thymocytes. The results indicates that TCGF and TRF activities reside on independent, although perhaps related, molecules.",M2

The hybrid supernatant acts exclusively in antigen-nonspecific, but antigen-dependent, promotion of B cell differentiation. It is optimally effective in the presence of small amounts of EL4 supernatant. It does not itself contain any detectable IL 2 or BCGF or interferon activity, however. 14G3.1F2 activity is probably an important component of the conventional <e>TRF</e> preparations produced by mixed lymphocyte populations, and will be useful in further dissection of the contributions of different soluble T cell products to B cell differentiation.",M2

T91 constitutively produced a factor that markedly enhanced the proliferative response to LPS of B cells cultured at low cell density. This factor is nonmitogenic by itself. It maintains in the absence of LPS, the proliferation of B cell blasts previously activated with LPS for 3 days.

In order to test this possibility we studied whether spleen cells from mice injected with 400-800 micrograms of anti-IgD antibody 1-3 days before sacrifice had an enhanced capacity to adsorb TRF activity from a partially purified culture supernatant of concanavalin A-stimulated mouse spleen cells. We found that spleen cells from euthymic or congenitally athymic mice injected 24-30 hr prior to sacrifice with either affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgD antibody or a monoclonal allospecific anti-IgD antibody had greater than 100 times the TRF adsorptive capacity of spleen cells from control mice. In contrast, spleen cells from anti-IgD treated DBA/2Ha mice, which have been shown to have an immune defect associated with the lack of a TRF receptor, were unable to adsorb TRF activity from concanavalin A-stimulated helper supernatants. This suggests that the crosslinking of B-cell surface immunoglobulin may induce B lymphocytes to express a receptor or receptors for TRF and thus enhance B-cell responsiveness to this helper factor.",M2

The cultivation was performed in bioreactors which allow regulation of dissolved oxygen concentration. The oxygen supply influenced the yields of individual lymphokines in different ways. High oxygen concentration was beneficial for high release of IL-2 and MCF, whereas MIF and TRF were better produced at low oxygen concentrations. CSF release did not depend on oxygen supply. Upon stimulation with Con A, lymphokine activities in the culture supernatant reached an optimum or plateau after 24 h Lymphocytes continued with lymphokine release, when they were restimulated for further 24 h. in fresh medium and mitogen.

Proliferation and polyclonal antibody synthesis are reduced two-five-fold in aged animals compared to the young-adult responses. Furthermore, Fc fragments are unable to potentiate plaque-forming cell (PFC) development in aged animals. Aged B-lymphocytes are deficient in responding to Fc fragments, as their admixture with young-adult T-cells does not restore polyclonal antibody formation. T-cells from aged animals are also ineffective in promoting the polyclonal response when mixed with young-adult B-cells. The T-cell lesion has been further defined as a deficiency in production of an Fc fragment induced T-cell-replacing factor [(Fc)<e>TRF</e>].

We found that the suboptimal helper activity which occurs when TRF is added early rather than late in the response cannot be attributed to the inactivation of the mediator, but results instead from the generation of helper factor-induced suppressor cells. Serological examination revealed that these suppressor cells exhibit the cell surface phenotype (Thy 1-, Ia+, IgG+, IgD+) of a B cell. In an attempt to attribute the generation of suppressor B cells to a distinct T-cell product we examined two T-cell mediators believed to be present in TRF, namely IL-2 and a second factor recently introduced as (DL) TRF.

The TRF substituting activity of the antiserum was apparent in that anti-Thy-1 plus C-treated, DNP-primed B cells from TRF high-responder mice were effectively stimulated, whereas B cells from TRF low-responder DBA/2Ha mice were not, as evidenced by the induction of secondary anti-DNP IgG PFC responses. The specificity of the reaction of the antibody with a component present on the TRF high-responder B cells was also substantiated by the fact that antibody activity was virtually eliminated by absorption with B cells from various TRF high-responder mice but not by TRF low-responder DBA/2Ha B cells. The IgG fraction of antiserum and the F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments of the antibody, which possess a comparable reactivity in regard to the TRF acceptor site(s), were prepared, and analysis of the B cell-triggering mechanism by the antibody was carried out.

TRF works in concert with a growth factor, probably IL 2, in the induction of activated B cells. In previous studies, TRF was identified in culture supernatants of activated T cells and accessory cells, and thus the cellular source (T cell or accessory cell) of the factor was not determined. In the present studies, we succeeded in inducing the production of TRF by T cell populations from which accessory cells had been vigorously depleted. Lymph node cells were depleted of accessory cells by nylon wool adherence and anti-Ia and complement treatment; these cells were activated with Con A and a T cell hybridoma supernatant that contains IL 2. Supernatants from these activated T cell cultures supported the differentiation of anti-Ig-activated B cells to Ig secreting cells. These results show that T cells produce the differentiation factor, and further that they do so in response to ligand (Con A) plus a T cell-derived factor.",M2
6798119,"The requirement for esterase activation in T cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>)-induced IgG production in a human B blastoid cell line.Involvement of stimulus-activatable serine esterase in the process of TRF-induced IgG production in a human B blastoid cell line (CESS) was demonstrated. Addition of DFP or PMSF (1 X 10(-3) M to 1 X 10(-5) M) showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on TRF-induced IgG induction in CESS cells. Other organophosphorous inhibitors, such as p-NPEPP and PEPP, were also effective, but a nonphosphorylating analogue of DFP, DMP, was not inhibitory. Simultaneous addition of DFP with TRF showed the inhibitory effect, and the inhibition was irreversible. However, pretreatment of the cells with DFP did not abrogate TRF-induced IgG production. In synchronized cells, signals provided by TRF could be transduced only when cells were in the G1-phase, and DFP showed an inhibitory effect only when it was added to cells in the G1-phase with TRF. One amino acid derivative (AAME) partially inhibited TRF-induced IgG production.",M2

6976370,"Biochemical characterization of regulatory factors derived from T cell hybridomas and spleen cells. II. Evidence for glycosylation of T cell growth factor, T cell replacing factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that T cell growth factor (TCGF), T cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) derived from concanavalin A-stimulated T cell hybridomas and spleen cells are heterogeneous with respect to charge. The spleen cell-derived TCGF and TRF activities focused with isoelectric points (pI) between 3.5 and 6.5 whereas the range for GM-CSF activity was broader (pI, 3.5 to 8.0). The T cell hybridoma-derived activities were slightly more acidic. Neuraminidase treatment of both hybridoma 123 and spleen cell-derived material resulted in a major peak of each activity (TRF/TCGF pI, 4.9; GM-CSF pI, 4.7). Neuraminidase treatment of hybridoma T6-derived material resulted in peaks of TRF and TCGF around 6.0 as well as one around 5.0, suggesting that this charge heterogeneity was due to causes other than variations in the level of sialic acid on the relevant molecules. Tunicamycin-treated spleen cells or hybridoma 123 cells released biologically active TCGF, TRF, and GM-CSF. Each of these three activities from tunicamycin-treated spleen cells focused with pI around 5.0. A major fraction of TRF, TCGF, and GM-CSF activities bound to wheat-germ agglutinin. GM-CSF also bound to concanavalin A and lentil lectin. These results suggest that the molecules responsible for TCGF, TRF, and GM-SCF activities are glycosylated and that the observed heterogeneity in charge and lectin-binding characteristics is due in part to variable glycosylation. Glycosylation was not critical for any of the three biologic activities. No conclusive separation of TRF and TCGF activities was observed in these experiments although GM-CSF differed from TRF and TCGF in that it bound to Concanavalin A.",M2
6976369,"Biochemical characterization of regulatory factors derived from T cell hybridomas and spleen cells. I. Separation of T cell growth factor and T cell replacing factor from granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.We describe the molecular characteristics of T cell growth factor (TCGF), T cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by a T cell hybridoma after stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A). All three activities could be separated from Con A itself by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The TRF and TCGF activities had a m.w. of 35,000 to 40,000 on gel filtration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Their m.w. were about 30,000 under dissociating conditions in guanidine hydrochloride and about 35,000 to 40,000 under disulfide reducing conditions, suggesting the molecule(s) lacked noncovalent or disulfide-linked subunit structure. GM-CSF had a m.w. of 25,000 to 30,000 by gel filtration in PBS and about 23,000 in guanidine hydrochloride. TRF and TCGF on the one hand and GM-CSF on the other could be distinguished by the criteria of m.w., relative heat sensitivity, and hydrophobic chromatography. TCGF could not be separated from TRF by any of these methods. In terms of all the above properties, factor derived from the T cell hybridoma and spleen cells appeared identical.",M2
7026423,"X-linked recessive inheritance of a defective responsiveness to T-cell-replacing factor in DBA/2Ha mice.<e>TRF</e> responsivity of B-cells from an F1 hybrid of the low-responder strain DBA/2Ha (female) and the high-responder strain BALB/c (male), or their reciprocal F1 hybrid (BALB/c (female) X DBA/2Ha (male)), was analyzed. In every case the B-cells from all of the male mice of the (DBA/2Ha X BALB/c) (DC)F1 hybrid were incapable of responding to TRF, whereas B-cells from female mice of the same litter responded to TRF. In contrast, B-cells from both male and female (BALB/c X DBA/2Ha) (CD)F1 mice were able tp respond to TRF, strongly suggesting that the responsivity of B-cells to TRF is controlled by the X-chromosome of the high-response animals. To substantiate further the evidence for a X-linked B-cell defect in DBA/2Ha mice, we analyzed TRF responsivity of B-cells from back-cross (DCF1 (female) X DBA/2Ha (male)) progeny and from F2 (DCF1 X DCF1) progeny, respectively. In both crosses we observed segregation of TRF responsivity into high-responder and low-responder groups in a nearly 1:1 ratio. These findings further indicated that a major component involved in the regulation of TRF responsivity is carried on the X-chromosome. This component is defective in DBA/2Ha mice, the defect being inherited in a recessive manner.",M2
6972960,"T cell-replacing factor- (<e>TRF</e>) induced IgG secretion in a human B blastoid cell line and demonstration of acceptors for TRF.IgG-secretion was induced in a human B blastoid cell line, CESS, by the addition of partially purified T cell-derived helper factor(s) (TRF), which had been obtained from PHA-stimulated human T cells. The number of IgG-producing cells in CESS cells reached its maximal level (10% of total cells) within 48 hr after the addition of TRF. TRF did not affect the proliferation of CESS cells and the block of cell proliferation with hydroxyurea did not inhibit the increase of IgG-producing cells, showing that TRF induced IgG-production in CESS cells without any requirement of cell division. TRF activity was completely removed by CESS cells but TCGF-activity in the same preparation was not absorbed with CESS cells. On the other hand, TCGF-dependent human killer cells absorbed TCGF activity but not TRF activity in the same preparation. The binding of 125I-labeled factor(s) on CESS cells was also demonstrated. These results showed the presence of acceptors for TRF on the surface of CESS cells and this cell line will provide useful means for the chemical characterization of acceptors and for the study of the mechanisms of the signal transmission through acceptors.",M2
6971921,"Mineral deficiency effects on the generation of cytotoxic T-cells and T-helper cell factors in vitro.Generation of cytotoxic T-cell response of splenocytes was studied in vitro under copper, magnesium and zinc-deficient conditions. Viability of the short-term lymphocyte cultures in the deficient media was comparable with control condition viability. Cell mediated lympholysis (CML) was analyzed in an alloantigen-stimulated mixed lymphocyte culture (Balb/c versus CBA/H mice) using a 51Cr release assay. Lymphocytes cultured in copper and magnesium-deficient media failed to generate specific lysis to allogeneic target cells, whereas lymphocytes cultured in zinc-deficient media did generate T-killer cell activity at reduced levels. In examining the site of mineral deficiency effects, the actions of T-helper cell-produced factors was studied. There was no production of T-cell replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>) in any of the elementally deficient media by cultured splenocytes. The addition of TRF produced under normal control conditions to copper-deficient media completely restored the CML, whereas only a partial restoration of the CML was noted for the magnesium and zinc-deficient cells. The defect in the CML in the copper-deficient media appears to be focused on the T-helper cell, but magnesium and zinc deficiency effects appear to also be at other levels of cell differentiation and proliferation in the generation of CML.",M2
7002015,"Differentiation signal defect of splenic cells from LPS-treated mice.Spleen cells from mice sensitized with 10 microgram of LPS given intravenously are unable, when stimulated in vitro 48 h after this treatment, to respond to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Addition of T-cell replacing factors (<e>TRF</e>) to these cells restores their capacity to mount an anti-SRBC immune response. Killing of the cells proliferating under antigen stimulation by highly radioactive thymidine leads to the suppression of the anti-SRBC response observed in the presence of TRF. These experiments suggests that the proliferative events leading to the expansion of B cell precursors under antigen stimulation is not impaired by the treatment by LPS. These preliminary data show that the defect is linked to the lack of signals leading to the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells.",M2

6975944,"Purification of murine helper T cell-replacing factors.Humoral factors secreted by T lymphocytes and macrophages appear to play a role in cell communication leading to the triggering of immune responses. A factor has been purified from the culture supernatants of concanavalin A(Con A)-activated murine spleen cells with lymphokine activity in four assay systems. 1) stimulation of antibody responses to erythrocyte antigens in BALB/c.nu spleen cultures 2) amplification of production of cytotoxic T cells in thymocyte cultures, 3) stimulation of mitogenic responses to Con A in thymocyte cultures where the cell density is too low to support responses to Con A alone, and 4) maintenance of continuous T cell growth. The biologic activity has been sequentially purified by salt precipitation, gel filtration, chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and isoelectric focusing (IEF). These four lymphokine activities appear to be due to one class of molecules, termed Interleukin 2 (IL-2), with an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 daltons. A T cell lymphoma, LBRM-33 has been found to produce high titers of IL-2 activity upon mitogen stimulation. LBRM-derived IL-2 possesses similar chemical and biological properties to splenic-derived IL-2. The mode of action of IL-2 appears to be the clonal expansion of antigen- or mitogen-activated T cells. While mitogen-activated LBRM cells secrete IL-2, which appears to exert helper T cell-replacing activity via the expansion of pre-T cells in nude spleens, mitogen-activated spleen cells appear to secrete both IL-2 and another class of T cell-replacing factor (<e>TRF</e>). These findings raise the question of whether there exist multiple classes of factors with TRF activity. The identification of these molecules may lead to an understanding of the mechanism that regulates the induction of antigen-sensitive cells.",M2
