20008193,"Determinants of platelet number and regulation of thrombopoiesis.Our understanding of thrombopoiesis has improved greatly in the last two decades with the availability of in vitro assays of megakaryocyte progenitor cell growth, with the cloning and characterization of stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>), the latter the primary humoral regulator of this process, and with the generation of genetically altered murine models of thrombopoietic failure and excess. While SCF affects developmentally early aspects of megakaryocyte growth, Tpo affects nearly all aspects of platelet production, from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and expansion, through stimulation of megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation, to supporting their maturation into platelet-producing cells. The molecular and cellular mechanisms through which the marrow microenvironment and humoral mediators affect platelet production provide new insights into the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on hematopoiesis, and highlight new opportunities to translate basic biology into clinical advances.",M1
19997800,"Effect of thrombopoietin on platelet counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in a rat model.PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) on platelet counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. METHODS: We performed 70% partial hepatectomy on 60 rats given either TPO or a vehicle (controls). The rats were killed 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, or 168 h after the procedure, and we examined the platelet counts, weight of the regenerated liver, hepatocyte proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index, and expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the controls, the platelet counts were significantly lower than the basal levels, by about 20%, at 6, 24, and 72 h; then recovered to the basal level at 168 h. Conversely, in the TPO-treated rats, the platelet counts increased significantly by 17%, 35%, and 60%, at 24, 72, and 168 h, respectively. The regenerated liver regained 80% of the pre-hepatectomy weight by 72 h in the controls, whereas reconstitution of the liver was accomplished by 72 h in the TPO-treated rats. Thrombopoietin significantly enhanced the BrdU labeling index of hepatocytes and expression of HGF mRNA 24 h post hepatectomy in TPO-treated rats versus controls. CONCLUSION: Thrombopoietin increased platelet counts; thereby accelerating liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy with enhanced induction of HGF.",M1
19932428,"Thrombopoietin and platelet production in chronic immune thrombocytopenia.Since 1968, a greater understanding of platelet biology and its regulation by thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) has emerged. It is now recognized that immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder of reduced platelet production as well as increased platelet destruction. New therapies for ITP have emerged that have exploited this new pathophysiologic understanding. This article reviews the biology of TPO, the regulation of its circulating level in ITP, the platelet kinetic data supporting inappropriate platelet production in ITP, and the TPO mimetic agents available to treat ITP.",M1
19891528,"Thrombopoietic cytokines and platelet count in multiple myeloma.Cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta are both implicated in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis and megakaryopoiesis. The dynamic interaction between thrombopoiesis and thrombopoietic cytokines in MM may affect platelet (PLT) counts. Sixty-eight patients with MM (30 female, 38 male; median age 58 (40-79), 38 newly diagnosed, 15 in plateau, and 15 relapse and/or refractory patients) and 21 controls were included in the study. Plasma levels of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), IL-1beta, IL-11 and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. PLT counts were not different between the control group and MM patients with various disease stages and activity. IL-6 and TPO levels were higher in MM patients than healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.001). PLT counts were inversely correlated with TPO (r = -0.566; p &lt; 0.001) and positively correlated with IL-6 (r = 0.263; p = 0.04) levels in MM patients. TPO and IL-6 levels were significantly correlated (r = 0.305; p &lt; 0.001). Disease activity has no effect on plasma cytokine levels. TPO levels were higher in stage III than stage I (p = 0.05) and stage II (p = 0.03) patients in newly diagnosed MM. High TPO levels induced by IL-6 may sustain normal PLT counts despite bone marrow infiltration by plasma cells and decreased PLT half-life.",M1
19889150,"High platelet count associated with venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS).BACKGROUND: In cancer patients, laboratory parameters that predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) are scarce. Increased platelet count has been found to be a risk factor for VTE in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (CHT). We have assessed high platelet count as a risk predictor for VTE in patients with cancer undergoing discriminative anti-cancer treatments and investigated whether platelet count correlates with thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS) is an ongoing prospective observational study of patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease, which started in October 2003. Occurrence of VTE and information on the patients' anti-cancer treatment during follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: Between October 2003 and February 2008, 665 patients with solid tumors were included (314 female/351 male, mean age 62 years). VTE occurred in 44 patients (18 female/26 male, mean age 62 years). The cumulative probability of VTE after 1 year was 34.3% in patients with a platelet count (PC) above the 95th percentile representing 443 x 10(9)/L compared with 5.9% in those below 443 x 10(9)/L. High platelet count [hazard ratio (HR): 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.52-8.06, P = 0.0032], soluble P-selectin [HR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.42-4.96, P = 0.0021] and surgery [HR: 4.05, 95% CI: 1.74-9.46, P = 0.0012] were statistically significant risk factors for VTE in multivariable analysis along with leucocyte count, age, gender, radio- and CHT. We found no correlation between platelet count and TPO levels. CONCLUSIONS: High PC is a clinically important, independent risk predictor for VTE in cancer patients. PC was not found to be associated with TPO levels.",M1
19880496,"Ubiquitination and degradation of the thrombopoietin receptor c-Mpl.Regulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling is essential for maintaining physiologic numbers of circulating hematopoietic cells. Thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>), acting through its receptor c-Mpl, is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and megakaryopoiesis. Therefore, the negative regulation of Tpo signaling is critical in many aspects of hematopoiesis. In this study, we determine the mechanisms of c-Mpl degradation in the negative regulation of Tpo signaling. We found that, after Tpo stimulation, c-Mpl is degraded by both the lysosomal and proteasomal pathways and c-Mpl is rapidly ubiquitinated. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to determine that c-Mpl is ubiquitinated on both of its intracellular lysine (K) residues (K(553) and K(573)). By mutating these residues to arginine, ubiquitination and degradation were significantly reduced and caused hyperproliferation in cell lines expressing these mutated receptors. Using short interfering RNA and dominant negative overexpression, we also found that c-Cbl, which is activated by Tpo, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the ubiquitination of c-Mpl. Our findings identify a previously unknown negative regulatory pathway for Tpo signaling that may significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms affecting the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes.",M1
19852692,"Thrombopoiesis in small for gestational age newborns.Thrombocytopenia in small for gestational age (SGA) newborns may be due to placental vascular pathology, fetal consumptive coagulopathy and platelet destruction, local imbalance of thromboxane A2 causing placental vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. Thrombopoiesis in SGA newborns is poorly recognized. In 61 SGA newborns we evaluated thrombocytopoiesis in relation to gender and the rate maturity expressed as &lt;5th percentile and &lt;10th percentile. Female newborns demonstrated higher thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) level at 92.06 pg/ml than male newborns at 79.81 pg/ml. Newborns less developed &lt;5th percentile, showed increased TPO level of 92.0 pg/ml in comparison to &lt;10th percentile of 78.0 pg/ml. This observation is more pronounced in female newborns. Contrary to our expectations we did not find any statistically significant differences in the percentage of reticulated platelets (PLRET) and platelets count in relation to gender and &lt;5th percentile or &lt;10th percentile. We can postulate intrauterine hypoxia is responsible for the increase of erythropoietin and impairment of thrombopoiesis in SGA newborns.",M1
19849948,"[Roles of platelet and its regulating factors in immune vasculitis in young rabbits]OBJECTIVE: To study the roles of platelet (PLT) and its regulating factors, megakaryocyte, thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), in immune vasculitis in young rabbits. METHODS: An experimental model of Kawasaki disease (KD) of weanling rabbits was reproduced by bovine serum. PLT count, total number and differentiating count of megakaryocyte, and serum TPO and TGF-beta1 levels were measured 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 days after KD induction. Pathological analysis of coronary artery, liver, spleen, kidney and brain was performed 17 and 28 days after KD induction. RESULTS: In the KD group, PLT count, the total number of megakaryocyte, and the middle board megakaryocyte percentage increased 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 days; serum TPO level increased 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 days; serum TGF-beta1 level increased 16, 20, 24 and 28 days after KD induction compared with those in the normal control group (p&lt;0.05). The pathological examinations of coronary artery, liver, spleen, kidney and brain showed severe inflammatory injuries of tiny arteries and small/medium-sized arteries 17 and 28 days after KD induction, respectively in the KD group. The aortas were showed as mild inflammatory injuries. CONCLUSIONS: PLT, megakaryocyte, TPO and TGF-beta1 participate in the pathogenesis of KD, and they may play an important role in the injuries of immune vasculitis. This suggests that they may serve as markers for the assessment of severity in KD.",M1
19843480,"Romiplostim in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by platelet deficiency due to platelet destruction and/or inadequate production. Initial therapy consists of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Patients with chronic refractory disease might undergo splenectomy. Although there is no treatment of choice in those who do not respond to splenectomy, immunosuppressive agents are typically prescribed. Romiplostim is the first available drug in a recently developed class of agents that work through stimulation of the thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) receptor (c-Mpl) to increase platelet production. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report was to review the mechanism of action, pharmacology, clinical activity, and adverse events associated with the use of romiplostim for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP. METHODS: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Web of Science were searched for English-only clinical trials and reviews (publication dates: 2000-June 1, 2009; key terms: romiplostim, Nplate, ITP, and idiopathic and immune thrombocytopenic purpura). Abstracts from the 2000-2008 meetings of the American Society of Hematology and references from relevant articles were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included. Romiplostim is the first marketed agent developed to directly stimulate the bone marrow to produce platelets. Produced in Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA technology, it is an Fc-peptide fusion protein. It works intracellularly in a manner similar to that of the naturally occurring TPO to activate the transcriptional pathways, leading to increased platelet production via stimulation of the c-Mpl receptor. Romiplostim was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic ITP primarily based on the findings from 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in 125 adult patients with chronic ITP and an insufficient response to corticosteroids, IVIg, and/or splenectomy. The most common prior treatments were corticosteroids (94%) and IVIg (80%). Sixty-three patients (50%) were splenectomized a median of 6.6 years earlier. Baseline platelet counts were &lt;30 x 10(9) cells/L. The initial dose of romiplostim was 1 microg/kg/wk SC, with adjustments to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 200 x 10(9) cells/L. The primary end point was a durable platelet response (&gt;or=50 x 10(9) cells/L for &gt;or=6 of the last 8 weeks of treatment). The proportion of patients in whom a durable platelet response was achieved was significantly greater with romiplostim than with placebo (49% vs 2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Overall platelet responses (durable plus transient) were achieved in 83% (69/83) with romiplostim and 7% (3/42) with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). An interim report of findings from an ongoing extension study found that response was maintained for up to 156 weeks (median, 69 weeks) with romiplostim. The most common adverse events were headache (37%), nasopharyngitis (32%), contusion (30%), epistaxis (30%), fatigue (30%), arthralgia (25%), and diarrhea (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from this review, romiplostim administration has been associated with a durable platelet response in these patients with refractory chronic ITP. Romiplostim has been found to be generally well tolerated.",M1
19810084,"Modelling atypical small-molecule mimics of an important stem cell cytokine, thrombopoietin.We report the first comprehensive 3D QSAR study of a large, structurally diverse set of compounds that act as atypical thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) mimics by interacting with the transmembrane domain of the TPO receptor, c-MPL. These agonists of c-MPL were superimposed according to a pharmacophore hypothesis, resulting in 3D QSAR models of high statistical significance. The pharmacophore-based superimposition and comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were used to derive the QSAR models relating structure to the published in vitro bioactivities of the TPO mimics. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models gave high correlation coefficients of the bioactivities with the derived fields, resulting in robust prediction of agonist activity of the superimposed compounds. The models have been interpreted in terms of the requirements for binding to the transmembrane domain of the TPO receptor.",M1
19778863,"New thrombopoietic growth factors.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is the physiologic regulator of platelet production and works by binding to its receptor on megakaryocyte precursor cells, thereby activating a large number of antiapoptotic and cell maturation pathways.  First-generation  recombinant forms of TPO were developed over a decade ago and were found to increase the platelet count in patients undergoing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and myelodysplasia, as well as in platelet apheresis donors. Thrombopoietin did not improve platelet counts in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or acute leukemia induction. Further development ended when antibodies formed against one of the recombinant proteins. Subsequently, 2  second-generation  TPO mimetics have been developed and are entering clinical practice: romiplostim and eltrombopag. Romiplostim is an injectable peptide TPO mimetic that activates the TPO receptor just like native TPO. Eltrombopag is an oral nonpeptide TPO mimetic that activates the TPO receptor by binding to a different region of the TPO receptor that does not compete with TPO binding. Both increased the platelet counts in healthy subjects and in over two thirds of patients with ITP both before and after splenectomy; responses were maintained for at least 1 year. Romiplostim and eltrombopag are now US Food and Drug Administration approved for the second-line treatment of patients with ITP. Adverse events have been few, but long-term assessment for reticulin formation, increased bone marrow blasts, and thromboembolism is ongoing. Studies are under way to assess the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of other thrombocytopenic disorders associated with chemotherapy, myelodysplasia, and chronic hepatitis.",M1
19744539,"Ex vivo expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells by a small-molecule agonist of c-MPL.OBJECTIVE: The signaling by thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) via its receptor, c-MPL, plays a crucial role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Small-molecule c-MPL agonists have recently been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of thrombocytopenia. However, their effects on HSCs have not yet been explored. In this study, we evaluated the effects of NR-101, a novel small-molecule c-MPL agonist, on the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood (hCB) HSCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: hCB CD34(+) or CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were cultured for 7 days in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO) or NR-101, and then subjected to flow cytometric analyses, colony-forming cell assays, and severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating cell assays. RESULTS: During a 7-day culture of CD34(+) or CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, NR-101 efficiently increased their numbers, with a greater than twofold increase compared to TPO, although its effect on megakaryocytopoiesis was comparable to that of TPO. Correspondingly, severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating cells were increased 2.9-fold during a 7-day culture with NR-101 compared to freshly isolated CD34(+) cells, and 2.3-fold compared to that with TPO. Of note, NR-101 persistently activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 but not signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Furthermore, NR-101 induced a long-term accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein and enhanced activation of its downstream target genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first time that a small-molecule c-MPL agonist has been demonstrated to promote net expansion of HSCs. NR-101 is more efficient in ex vivo expansion of HSCs than TPO. NR-101 could be a useful tool for the therapeutic manipulation of human HSCs.",M1
19689996,"Thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C: a possible role of HCV on platelet progenitor cell maturation.A total of 30 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) thrombocytopenia (TP) and 20 healthy controls were studied. Both groups were subjected to complete medical history, clinical examination in addition to assessment of hepatitis markers: level of thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>), Geimsa-stained bone marrow smears, and in vitro short-term megakaryocytic progenitors culture (CFU-MK). Serum Tpo level was significantly elevated in patients with TP HCV. Short-term CFU-MK showed an evident depression in the colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-meg). There is a positive correlation between the number of CFU-meg and the platelet count and between serum Tpo level and prothrombin time, transaminase, albumin, and the Child Pugh score of liver disease; a negative correlation between serum Tpo level and the number of CFU-meg and between serum Tpo level and the platelet count. Thus, the level of Tpo could be an indicator of intact functional response of the hepatocytes.",M1
19675574,"Serum thrombopoietin level and thrombocytopenia during the neonatal period in infants with Down's syndrome.BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia during the neonatal period in Down's syndrome (DS) infants remains unclear.Objective:To elucidate kinetic changes of serum thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) level and platelet count, and their correlation in DS neonates. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve DS infants (male/female: 7/5, term/late preterm: 10/2) born between 1997 and 2007 were included. Blood samples were serially collected during the neonatal period and serum TPO levels were determined in 44 sera using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia &lt;150 x 10(9) per liter was observed in seven (58%) patients. In 12 DS patients, the median TPO value showed 2.86 fmol ml(-1) on day 0, rose to 4.64 fmol ml(-1) on day 2, and thereafter decreased to 4.30 fmol ml(-1) on day 5, 2.40 fmol ml(-1) on days 11-15, and 1.75 fmol ml(-1) on days 28-30. This kinetics parallels that in historical non-DS controls. In 35 pair sample analysis from 11 patients without transient myeloproliferative disease, TPO level inversely correlated with platelet count (r=-0.38, P=0.023). However, there was no significant difference in TPO concentrations between thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic DS individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the relationship between TPO level and platelet count in neonates with DS. Median TPO levels and their kinetic changes in DS neonates are comparable to those in non-DS controls. In contrast to earlier findings in several studies showing higher TPO concentrations in thrombocytopenic non-DS newborns than those in non-thrombocytopenic counterparts, the response of the TPO system to thrombocytopenia in DS during the neonatal period seems suboptimal.",M1
19657231,"HIF-1 prevents the overproduction of mitochondrial ROS after cytokine stimulation through induction of PDK-1.Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are toxic to hematopoietic cells. The majority of cellular ROS are derived from mitochondria and glucose metabolism, and cytokines stimulate this process. During hypoxia, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) attenuates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS production through the induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1). Previously, we found that thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) induces the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Interestingly, the TPO-induced production of mitochondrial ROS promotes the activation of HIF-1. Based on these findings, we speculated that TPO-activated HIF-1 functions as a feedback mechanism to block the overproduction of ROS following TPO stimulation. We found that TPO induces the expression of PDK-1 in a TPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/TPO, in a HIF-1-dependent manner. Inhibition of either HIF-1 or PDK-1 resulted in the increased production of ROS following TPO stimulation. Our observations suggest that HIF-1 functions as a ROS sensor to prevent the overproduction of mitochondrial ROS following cytokine stimulation.",M1
19642221,"Thrombopoietin and thrombopoietin mimetics in the treatment of thrombocytopenia.Although the thrombopoietin receptor was discovered in 1991 and thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) was purified in 1994, the development of a clinically useful TPO was hampered by the appearance of neutralizing antibodies to some forms of recombinant TPO. However, in 2008 two new drugs that mimic the effect of TPO became available to treat thrombocytopenia. Romiplostim is a TPO peptide mimetic given by subcutaneous injection that activates the TPO receptor by binding to the distal hematopoietic receptor domain just like TPO. Eltrombopag is a TPO nonpeptide mimetic administered orally that activates the TPO receptor by binding to the transmembrane domain. Both increase the platelet count in healthy humans as well as in &gt;80% of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Although initially restricted to the second-line treatment of ITP, both agents could help treat many thrombocytopenic disorders. Both agents are well tolerated, with mild headache being the most common complaint. Potential long-term complications include thrombosis, increased bone marrow reticulin, rebound worsening of thrombocytopenia upon discontinuation, and increased blast formation. Ongoing studies should establish the incidence of these complications and determine the efficacy of these new agents in a variety of other thrombocytopenic conditions.",M1
19631713,"Comparative analyses of the small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag and thrombopoietin on in vitro platelet function.OBJECTIVE: The thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) is a therapeutic target for treatment of thrombocytopenia because stimulation of this receptor results in enhanced megakaryocyte proliferation, differentiation, and ultimately platelet production. In addition to effects on megakaryocytes, TPOR stimulation also impacts platelet function. The present study examined platelet function following stimulation with the small molecule TPOR agonist eltrombopag. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Platelets were obtained from healthy volunteers, and signal transduction pathway activation was examined in washed platelet preparations. Platelet aggregation was examined in both washed platelet preparations and platelet-rich plasma. Platelet alpha-granule release was determined via fluorescein-activated cell sorting measurement of CD62P. RESULTS: In signal transduction studies of washed human platelets, eltrombopag induced the phosphorylation signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins with no phosphorylation of Akt, whereas recombinant human <e>TPO</e> (rhTPO) induced the phosphorylation of Akt as well as STAT-1, -3, and -5. In studies conducted at subthreshold/submaximal concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen, eltrombopag pretreatment did not result in platelet aggregation. In contrast, rhTPO acted in synergy with submaximal concentrations of ADP or collagen to induce maximal aggregation under all conditions examined. Similarly, platelet activation as examined via surface expression of CD62P was not enhanced by eltrombopag pretreatment as compared to rhTPO. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the nonpeptidyl TPOR agonist eltrombopag stimulates platelet signal transduction with little or no effect on overall platelet function, in contrast to TPO, which significantly primes platelet activation. These data demonstrate that effects of TPOR ligands on platelet function can vary depending on the specific mechanism utilized to stimulate the TPOR.",M1
19630808,"Development of thrombopoietin receptor agonists for clinical use.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is an essential hematopoietic cytokine for megakaryopoiesis. In 2002, we demonstrated that pegylated-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) increased platelet counts in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a Phase I/II clinical trial. After the cessation of clinical trials of PEG-rHuMGDF because of severe thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia due to the development of the neutralizing antibody cross-reacting with endogenous TPO, second generation non-immunogenic TPO receptor agonists have been developed. A small molecule eltrombopag and Romiplostim were approved for clinical use by FDA in 2008 to treat patients with chronic ITP who are refractory to the prior therapy. Although the efficacy of both TPO receptor agonists is convincing for the refractory ITP, further investigation is necessary to assess the potential long-term side effects and clinical applications of these therapies for other thrombocytopenic conditions.",M1
19628164,"Thrombopoietin agonists for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in liver disease and hepatitis C.Thrombocytopenia is a condition of unusually low level of platelets in blood, resulting from an imbalance between the production and destruction of platelets, and is associated with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Thrombocytopenia can also be associated with severe chronic liver disease as a result of several factors that may act in concert, including reduced production of the endogenous thrombopoietic growth factor, thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). This article examines the nature of thrombocytopenia, ITP, and TPO.",M1
19553636,"Association of hereditary thrombocythemia and distal limb defects with a thrombopoietin gene mutation.Hereditary thrombocythemia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the thrombopoietin gene (<e>TPO</e>) or its receptor c-MPL. TPO mutations described so far lead to thrombopoietin overproduction through increased translation of m-RNA. Unilateral transverse reduction limb defects are usually sporadic and generally thought to be caused by vascular disruptions. Reports of inherited unilateral limb defects are extremely rare. In the present study, we describe a family with segregation of G185T TPO mutation in the 5' UTR region in 4 subjects with thrombocythemia. Three of these patients also present congenital transverse limb defects. Association of these events gives a strong hint of the in vivo involvement of thrombopoietin in vasculogenesis, confirming the role of TPO in human development of the hemangioblast, the embryonic progenitor of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. This is the first report showing that vascular disruptions could be secondary to specific gene derangements.",M1
19528793,"Prognostic value of immature platelet fraction and plasma thrombopoietin in disseminated intravascular coagulation.Although platelet count is a good parameter for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a single measurement of platelet is not enough to reflect the ongoing platelet consumption because of compensatory synthesis of circulating platelet number. Increased thrombopoiesis owing to peripheral destruction is expected in patients with DIC. Reticulated platelet, measured as immature platelet fraction (IPF), and plasma thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) are markers of platelet production. We investigated the potential usefulness of circulating IPF and TPO in 222 patients suspected of having DIC. Both IPF and TPO levels were significantly increased in overt DIC patients and well correlated with DIC score. IPF also correlated with fibrin-related marker such as fibrinogen degradation product and D-dimer. Both IPF and TPO showed better mortality prediction than platelet count with the multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. These results suggest that IPF and TPO are new potential candidates to detect the severity of DIC and to predict DIC mortality.",M1
19500160,"Thrombopoietin controls proliferation of embryonic multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) stimulation was reported to increase the number of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor (MPP) colonies in a methylcellose colony assay using cells from mouse embryos. Here, we investigated the expression of Mpl, the TPO receptor, in the cells from the yolk sac (YS) and the embryo proper (EP). MPPs in c-Kit(+) population in the mouse embryo expressed Mpl. Using liquid cultures, we found that MPPs from YS and EP proliferated in the presence of TPO and stem cell factor (SCF), whereas their numbers were maintained by TPO alone. In contrast, proliferation induced by TPO and SCF was not observed in MPPs of the bone marrow. Interestingly, examination of MPPs from the fetal liver indicated that their proliferative activity was intermediate between that of early embryonic and adult MPPs. These data suggest that early embryonic MPPs switch to adult MPPs in the embryo. Furthermore, the proliferation of early embryonic MPPs was suppressed by AG490, a Janus kinase2 (JAK2) inhibitor; and TPO could be replaced by constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) for the proliferation. Thus, JAK2 and STAT5 mediate at least a part of the proliferative signal in early embryonic MPPs.",M1
19490756,"Isolation and ex vivo expansion of human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ stem cells and their cotransplantation with or without mesenchymal stem cells.Umbilical cord blood (UCB) contains a high number of primitive progenitor cells, allowing UCB to be used as a source of hematopoietic progenitors for clinical transplantation. However the rate of UCB CD34(+) stem cells graft is low. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been implicated in playing an important role in hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In this study we examined the effect of human MSC on engraftment of human UCB-derived CD34(+) cells in irradiated Balb/c mice. Human UCB CD34(+) cells were obtained from full-term normal deliveries by using an immunomagnetic separation technique and MSC were isolated by standard methodology from human bone marrow. Isolated CD34(+) cells were cultured in Stemline Hematopoietic stem cell expansion medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF), and 100 ng/ml thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) in 24-well plates and incubated at 37 degrees C in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO(2), and maintained over 3 weeks and half the medium was exchanged twice a week. Irradiated (7 Gy) Balb/c mice were transplanted intravenously with 0.1 x 10(6) to 10 x 10(6) human UCB CD34(+) cells in the presence or absence of 0.5 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(6) human bone marrow-derived MSC. After 11 days, in each group, the spleen was dissected and colony assay performed. Hematoxilin and eosin staining of the spleen colony was performed, and UCB CD34(+) cells labeled with super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). After establishing the presence of colonies in spleen, Prussian blue staining was performed. Flow cytometry assay showed that up to 90% purity of CD34(+) cells and 96% for MSC. After 3 weeks the cell numbers showed a 1000-fold increase in CD34(+). Cotransplantation of low doses of UCB CD34(+) cells (0.2 x 10(6) and 0.3 x 10(6)) and MSC (0.5 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(6)) resulted in a significant increase in colony forming unit spleen, in comparison with engraftment of UCB CD34(+) stem cells without MSC after 11 days (p&lt;0.01). In conclusion the results showed that two cytokines (SCF, TPO) were sufficient for expansion of UCB CD34(+) cells and cotransplantation of MSC with UCB CD34(+) cells, promoting engraftment of UCB CD34(+) cells.",M1
19471020,"Differential expression of NADPH oxidases in megakaryocytes and their role in polyploidy.Megakaryocytes (MKs) undergo an endomitotic cell cycle, leading to polyploidy. We examined the expression of the flavoproteins and oxidative stress-promoting enzymes, NADPH oxidases (Nox's), in MKs because of their known role in promoting the cell cycle. Although the expression of Nox isoforms varies between cell types, they are induced at the mRNA level by mitogenic stimuli. Western blotting or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of purified mouse MKs isolated from thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>)-treated bone marrow (BM) cultures indicated high expression of Nox1, a weak expression of Nox4, and no significant expression of Nox2. Immunofluorescence of freshly isolated MKs confirmed strong expression of Nox1 in one-third of MKs, whereas Nox1 staining was detected in nearly all MKs in TPO-stimulated BM cultures. Treatment of mouse BM cultures with Nox inhibitors resulted in accumulation of MKs with low DNA content levels and significant reduction of higher ploidy MKs. Purified, Nox-inhibited MKs showed a notable decrease in the level of the G(1) phase cyclin E, a cyclin associated with MK polyploidy, and its up-regulation restored most of the effect of Nox inhibitors. Hence, this study shows the expression of Nox isoforms in MKs and highlights a potential role of flavoproteins in promoting polyploidization in this lineage.",M1
19461187,"A case of acute promyelocytic leukemia showing transient thrombocytosis caused by increased interleukin-6 and thrombopoietin after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy.A patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL)treated with all-trans retinoic acid(ATRA)and chemotherapy for remission induction developed marked thrombocytosis after bone marrow recovery. Thrombocytosis also occurred after post remission chemotherapies, although the degree of thrombocytosis gradually decreased. During thrombocytosis, plasma levels of interleukin-6(IL-6)were elevated while those of thrombopoietin(<e>TPO</e>)were not elevated. However, the plasma level of TPO was markedly elevated at the nadir after post remission chemotherapy. These findings suggest that in APL patients, thrombocytosis after treatment with ATRA and or chemotherapy may be caused by increased plasma levels of both of IL-6 and TPO.",M1
19438469,"Timed feeding of mice modulates light-entrained circadian rhythms of reticulated platelet abundance and plasma thrombopoietin and affects gene expression in megakaryocytes.Circadian (c. 24 h) rhythms of physiology are entrained to either the environmental light-dark cycle or the timing of food intake. In the current work the hypothesis that rhythms of platelet turnover in mammals are circadian and entrained by food intake was explored in mice. Mice were entrained to 12 h light-dark cycles and given either ad libitum (AL) or restricted access (RF) to food during the light phase. Blood and megakaryocytes were then collected from mice every 4 h for 24 h. It was found that total and reticulated platelet numbers, plasma thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) concentration and the mean size of mature megakaryocytes were circadian but not entrained by food intake. In contrast, a circadian rhythm in the expression of Arnt1 in megakaryocytes was entrained by food. Although not circadian, the expression in megakaryocytes of Nfe2, Gata1, Itga2b and Tubb1 expression was downregulated by RF, whereas Ccnd1 was not significantly affected by the feeding protocol. It is concluded that circadian rhythms of total platelet number, reticulated platelet number and plasma TPO concentration are entrained by the light-dark cycle rather than the timing of food intake. These findings imply that circadian clock gene expression regulates platelet turnover in mammals.",M1
19436840,"Romiplostim: a second-generation thrombopoietin agonist.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is the major regulator of both megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. TPO is a glycoprotein primarily produced in the liver. TPO, when binding to its receptor (c-Mpl), triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytes, with a concomitant increase in platelets. The cloning and characterization of TPO in 1994 led to the production of a full length, glycosylated recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) and a pegylated, truncated protein (PEGrHuMGDF). These first-generation TPO drugs stimulated megakaryocyte production and increased platelet counts in healthy volunteers. Successful clinical trials followed in cancer patients, patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and cancer patients receiving non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Neither rhTPO nor PEG-rHuMGDF raised platelet counts in myeloablated chemotherapy patients, probably due to a lack of megakaryocyte progenitor cells in their bone marrow. Unfortunately, neutralizing antibodies developed against TPO in 13 subjects who had received multiple injections of PEG-rHuMGDF. The resulting thrombocytopenia in these individuals ended all clinical trials with both drugs. A second generation of TPO growth factors have been developed and are in clinical trials. Researchers screened peptide libraries to find random, unrelated peptides that could stimulate TPO-dependent cell lines without also causing neutralizing antibody production. These peptides were then conjugated to various carrier molecules to increase their half-lives. This strategy led to the synthesis of romiplostim (AMG-531), with 2 sets of identical peptides linked to the Fc moiety of an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. This TPO peptide mimetic has shown success in clinical trials with healthy volunteers and individuals with ITP. No neutralizing antibodies have developed against AMG-531, however some thromboembolic events have occurred in high risk patients, and potentially reversible increases in bone marrow reticulin have been reported. Other TPO nonpeptide mimetics have been created by using a similar strategy with libraries of nonpeptide molecules that can stimulate TPO-dependent cell lines. Eltrombopag and AKR-501 are two drugs of this type that have shown positive results in clinical trials. In addition, antibodies that can stimulate the c-Mpl receptor are being engineered to act as potent TPO agonists. These and other drugs in preclinical development represent a new line of therapy for thrombocytopenic patients.",M1
19321863,"Derivation of functional mature neutrophils from human embryonic stem cells.Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) proliferate infinitely and are pluripotent. Only a few reports, however, describe specific and efficient methods to induce hESCs to differentiate into mature blood cells. It is important to determine whether and how these cells, once generated, behave similarly with their in vivo-produced counterparts. We developed a method to induce hESCs to differentiate into mature neutrophils. Embryoid bodies were formed with bone morphogenic protein-4, stem cell factor (SCF), Flt-3 ligand (FL), interleukin-6 (IL-6)/IL-6 receptor fusion protein (FP6), and thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). Cells derived from the embryoid bodies were cultured on a layer of irradiated OP9 cells with a combination of SCF, FL, FP6, IL-3, and TPO, which was later changed to granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Morphologically mature neutrophils were obtained in approximately 2 weeks with a purity and efficiency sufficient for functional analyses. The population of predominantly mature neutrophils (hESC-Neu's) showed superoxide production, phagocytosis, bactericidal activity, and chemotaxis similar to peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects, although there were differences in the surface antigen expression patterns, such as decreased CD16 expression and aberrant CD64 and CD14 expression in hESC-Neu's. Thus, this is the first description of a detailed functional analysis of mature hESC-derived neutrophils.",M1
19317837,"Elevated thrombopoietin in plasma of burned patients without and with sepsis enhances platelet activation.BACKGROUND: Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is a humoral growth factor that does not induce platelet aggregation per se, but enhances platelet activation in response to several agonists. Circulating levels of TPO are increased in patients with sepsis and are mainly related to sepsis severity. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential contribution of elevated TPO levels in platelet activation during burn injury complicated or not by sepsis. METHODS: We studied 22 burned patients, 10 without and 12 with sepsis, and 10 healthy subjects. We measured plasma levels of TPO, as well as leukocyte-platelet binding and P-selectin expression. The priming activity of plasma from burned patients or healthy subjects on platelet aggregation and leukocyte-platelet binding, and the role of TPO in these effects were also studied in vitro. RESULTS: Burned patients without and with sepsis showed higher circulating TPO levels and increased monocyte-platelet binding compared with healthy subjects. Moreover, TPO levels, monocyte-platelet binding and P-selectin expression were significantly higher in burned patients with sepsis than in burned patients without sepsis. In vitro, plasma from burned patients without and with sepsis, but not from healthy subjects, primed platelet aggregation, monocyte-platelet binding and platelet P-selectin expression. The effect of plasma from burned patients with sepsis was significantly higher than that of plasma from burned patients without sepsis. An inhibitor of TPO prevented the priming effect of plasma from burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Increased TPO levels may enhance platelet activation during burn injury and sepsis, potentially participating in the pathogenesis of multi-organ failure in these diseases.",M1
19262084,"[The analysis of thrombopoietin and clinical parameters as a marker for disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma]BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) causes the suppression of hematopoiesis because of malignant cells in the bone marrow. Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is regulated by a feedback mechanism with platelets. Recently, it was suggested that an elevated TPO without thrombocytopenia was associated with impaired hematopoiesis. We evaluated whether TPO levels could be a marker for disease progression in MM. METHODS: The TPO levels were measured in 70 blood samples from 27 patients (newly/previously-diagnosed patients=13/14). We analyzed the TPO and clinical parameters, WBC, hemoglobin, creatinine, calcium, M-protein, protein, albumin, and beta2-microglobulin. The TPO in 20 healthy controls ranged from 6 to 69 pg/mL. RESULTS: The TPO levels were significantly higher in MM patients with thrombocytopenia than in patients without thrombocytopenia and the healthy controls (median TPO: 293.0 pg/mL vs 59.6 pg/mL and 35.6 pg/mL, P&lt;0.0001). There was a negative correlation between the TPO levels and the blood cells, i.e., leukocytes (r=-0.293), hemoglobin (r=-0.378) and platelets (r=-0.508) (P&lt;0.05). Elevated TPO were found in association with normal platelet counts (N=20). Among the samples without thrombocytopenia, especially one year after the diagnosis, the hemoglobin (10.3 vs 12.9 g/dL, P=0.025) and albumin (3.3 vs 4.0 g/dL, P=0.085) were lower and the M-protein and protein tended to be higher in patients with elevated TPO compared to those with normal TPO. CONCLUSIONS: Serum TPO was elevated with thrombocytopenia and related to impaired hematopoiesis. The elevated TPO without thrombocytopenia might be considered as impaired hematopoiesis and a marker for disease progression in patients with MM.",M1

19219529,"Biological activity of dendritic cells generated from cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors in IL-7- and IL-13-conditioned cultures.INTRODUCTION: Dendritic cells (DCs) are required for initiation of the immune response and may therefore be used for the production of cancer vaccines. As mature DCs (mDCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells, there is increasing interest in generating them ex vivo. The present study was designed to obtain mDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors by culturing them in different media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors were expanded for 7 days in FST medium containing fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L), stem cell factor (SCF), and thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). Then the cells were divided into three parts and cultured for 21 days in different media: FST medium or FST enriched in interleukin (IL)-3 (FST3 medium) or supplemented with IL-7 and IL-13 (FST713 medium). At the end of culture part of the cells was harvested, counted, and analyzed while the other part was matured with proinflammatory cytokines for 2 days. The cells' phenotypes, ability to induce proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (allo-MLR), chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and O2(-) production were determined. RESULTS: The average fold increase of DCs at the end of culture in FST medium was 127, in FST3 1043, and in FST713 71. In comparison with the other media, FST713 medium supported the generation of mDCs that were characterized by higher expression of CD83, costimulatory molecules, and HLA-DR, enhanced ability to induce allo-MLR and migration to -macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 3beta poor phagocytosis, and O2(-) production. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that FST713 medium allows the generation of limited numbers of more mature DCs, while FST3 medium leads to the production of immature DCs in high numbers.",M1
19183407,"AKR-501 (YM477) a novel orally-active thrombopoietin receptor agonist.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production. We have searched for small molecule compounds that mimic the action of TPO by using human TPO receptor-expressed in Ba/F3 cells, resulting in the discovery of AKR-501 (YM477). AKR-501 specifically targeted the TPO receptor and stimulated megakaryocytopoiesis throughout the development and maturation of megakaryocytes just as rhTPO did. AKR-501, however, was shown to be effective only in humans and chimpanzees with high species specificity. Therefore, we examined the in vivo platelet-increasing effect of AKR-501 in human platelet producing non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34(+) cells. Daily oral administration of AKR-501 dose-dependently increased the number of human platelets in these mice, with significance achieved at doses of 1 mg/kg and above. The peak unbound plasma concentrations of AKR-501 after administration at 1 mg/kg in NOD/SCID mice were similar to those observed following administration of an active oral dose in human subjects. These results suggest that AKR-501 is an orally-active TPO receptor agonist that may be useful in the treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia.",M1
19151853,"Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. New agents.First generation thrombopoietic growth factors (rhTPO and PEG-rHuMGDF), investigated in the early 2000s, proved effective in increasing platelet count in normal volunteers, in thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and also in a few cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). These agents did not complete their clinical development since one of them induced antibodies in the recipients that cross reacted with endogenous thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), thus causing thrombocytopenia. This promoted the ingenious design of a new generation of thrombopoietic growth factors having no sequence homology with natural TPO. The two main agents are romiplostim, a peptibody already approved for clinical use in USA and eltrombopag, a non-peptide, orally active small molecule. In open label and placebo-controlled trials both agents proved to predictably increase platelet count in normal volunteers and in patients with ITP. With appropriate dosages (1-10 microg/kg weekly sub cutaneously for romiplostim; 50-75 mg/die per os for eltrombopag ) a platelet increase becomes significant after 7-10 days and peaks between 10-14 days. By discontinuing treatment, platelet count returns to baseline level in 10-15 days. The response rate with both agents is above 70-80%, also in patients that had undergone several lines of treatment, or that have failed splenectomy. The response is maintained during the treatment, but is almost invariably lost even after several months of successful administration. Due to the lack of a curative potential and to the incomplete knowledge of long-term side effects, the place of these new drugs in the management of ITP is still unsettled and their use is best restricted to refractory patients or in preparation of splenectomy. It seems however that a new paradigm in the treatment of ITP has been established where the focus is not on reducing platelet consumption but on increasing platelet production.",M1
19143871,"Reticulated platelets and thrombopoietin in schistosomiasis patients.Schistosomiasis mansoni is a non-cirrhotic liver disease. In cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension, a decreased number of reticulated platelets associated with increased thrombopoietin serum levels were reported.

To evaluate reticulated platelet counts and thrombopoietin serum levels (<e>TPO</e>) in schistosomiasis patients and correlate them with portal hypertension markers. Thirty-three schistosomiasis patients without co-morbidities were endoscopically classified as those with (n = 19) or without (n = 14) clinically significant portal hypertension. Flow cytometric determination of reticulated platelets was performed using CD41 antibody and thiazol orange. Ultrasonographic examinations were performed according to the Niamey protocol. TPO and hyaluronic acid serum levels were determined in duplicate using ELISA methods. The platelet number of 120/nl discriminates the two groups with 100% accuracy and 100% positive and negative predictive values, and correlates with spleen length and portal and splenic vein diameters. Differences in reticulated platelets and hyaluronic acid serum levels between both groups were significant (P = 0.025 and 0.012, respectively), but thrombopoietin serum levels were not (P = 0.769).

19132238,"Altered bioavailability of platelet-derived factor VIII during thrombocytosis reverses phenotypic efficacy in haemophilic mice.Ectopic delivery of factor VIII (FVIII) to megakaryocytes (Mk) represents a viable approach for localized tenase generation by concentrating the FVIIIa/FIXa enzyme-cofactor complex onto activated platelet membranes. We utilized a core rat platelet factor 4 (PF4) promoter for Mk/platelet-restricted expression of human B-domain-deleted (hBDD) FVIII within the background of a haemophilia A mouse (rPF4/hBDD/FVIII-/-). Platelets from rPF4/hBDD/FVIII(-/-) mice contained approximately 122 mU FVIII:C/1 x 10(9) platelets/ml with no detectable plasmatic FVIII:C, and with no effect on alpha-granule-derived platelet factor V/Va function. Paired tenase assays (+/- thrombin) confirmed that platelet (pt) FVIII (unlike platelet FV) required thrombin cleavage for complete activation. rPF4/hBDD/FVIII(-/-) mice exposed to a thrombocytotic stimulus (thrombopoietin, <e>TPO</e>) demonstrated a statistically-significant 66% reduction in molar ptFVIII activity with a non-significant reduction in total ptFVIII biomass. Decreased molar ptFVIII concentration correlated with loss of phenotypic correction as evaluated using a haemostatic tail-snip assay. Comparative studies using a transgenic mouse expressing human amyloid-beta-precursor protein (hAbetaPP) from the rPF4 promoter confirmed diminished hAbetaPP expression without affecting endogenous alpha-granule PF4, establishing generalizability of these observations. While Mk/platelet-released ptFVIII (unlike pFV) is proteolytically inactive, we also conclude that thrombocytotic stimuli negatively affect ptFVIII bioavailability and phenotypic efficacy, results which correlate best with molar ptFVIII concentration, and not systemically available ptFVIII.",M1

METHODS: The serum levels of sCD(23) and TPO of 25 CLL patients were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Flow cytometry was employed to determine the expression of CD(38) and ZAP-70 protein. RESULTS: TPO level in CLL patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls 67.22 - 1881.77 ng/L and 70.29 - 147.98 ng/L respectively, P = 0.003. sCD(23) level in CLL patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls 129.80 - 405.31 U/ml and 0.65 - 32.99 U/ml respectively, P = 0.000. TPO level was significantly correlated with Binet stage and CD(38) expression. Patients in stage B and C had higher level of TPO than those in stage A 140.57 - 457.48 ng/L and 121.92 - 163.83 ng/L respectively, P = 0.014, while TPO level was higher in patients with higher CD(38) expression than in patients lower CD(38) expression 113.23 - 199.10 ng/L and 141.34 - 454.92 ng/L respectively, P = 0.033.

19074086,"The pathophysiology of ITP revisited: ineffective thrombopoiesis and the emerging role of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in the management of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction that can be demonstrated by shortened radiolabeled platelet survival. An additional role of ineffective thrombopoiesis was suggested by autologous platelet kinetic studies performed in the 1980s. Sera of patients with ITP have been demonstrated to inhibit megakaryocyte growth in culture supporting the concept of suboptimal platelet production as a contributing factor to the thrombocytopenia. The relatively modest rise in thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) levels in thrombocytopenic patients with ITP has helped to identify the TPO receptor as a potential target for the treatment of ITP. Initial studies with recombinant TPO in patients with ITP were encouraging, and novel compounds designed to stimulate the TPO receptor and resultant pathways have been shown in randomized trials to be effective in raising the platelet count and sustaining it at safe levels. Adverse effects of these agents have been relatively mild, although rare serious events including increased bone marrow reticulin deposition, increased numbers of circulating blasts and thrombosis have occurred, and theoretic risks of stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet activation remain a concern. As these agents become available it will be important to identify those patients who will most benefit from their use. The place of these drugs in the current management algorithms of ITP will evolve over time as results of clinical trials with these agents and experience with their use in the clinic clarify short-term and long-term efficacy and potential toxicities.",M1

CD 34 (+) HCs optimally proliferated on LH/P MP-coated plates in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF; 5 ng/ml), thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>; 10 ng/ml), and Flt-3 ligand (Flt-3; 10 ng/ml) in hematopoietic progenitor growth medium (HPGM). After 6 days, the total cells expanded 16.5-fold. Those cytokines were shown to be partially immobilized on the LH/P MP-coated plates, and the immobilized cytokines were gradually released into the medium with half releasing time of 3-4 days. Since flow cytometry analyses revealed that 90% of initial cells and 44.5% of expanded cells were CD 34 positive, CD 34 (+) HCs were estimated to have increased 8.0-fold after 6 days, and to have increased to over 31.9-fold after 12 days. In contrast, cultured CD 34 (+) HCs on non-coated tissue culture plates increased only 2.9-fold in the identical medium after 6 days, and only 5.2-fold after 12 days.",M1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: We revealed that platelets induced by thrombopoietin administration promote liver regeneration after hepatectomy in the normal liver. METHODS: Seventy percent hepatectomy was carried out in rats, which were subsequently divided into 4 groups: (1) normal group without any treatment, (2) liver cirrhosis (LC) group, (3) combined thrombopoietin and liver cirrhosis (LC+<e>TPO</e>) group, and (4) combined thrombopoietin, antiplatelet serum and liver cirrhosis (LC+TPO+APS) group. Growth kinetics in the liver regeneration and growth factors were analyzed. Liver fibrotic area and activation of hepatic stellate cells were also investigated. RESULTS: In LC group, liver regeneration was significantly delayed compared with normal group 24 hours after hepatectomy. On the other hand, liver regeneration of LC+TPO group increased significantly compared with LC group, to a level that was the same as that recorded in normal group. In LC group, liver fibrotic area before hepatectomy was significantly higher compared with the normal group. Liver fibrosis of LC+TPO group was significantly reduced compared with LC group. The antifibrotic and liver regeneration promoting effects of LC+TPO group were inhibited by antiplatelet serum in LC+TPO+APS group. CONCLUSION: The administration of thrombopoietin reduces liver fibrosis and stimulates regeneration after hepatectomy through increment and accumulation of platelets in the cirrhotic liver. This could be a potentially useful treatment for liver cirrhosis.",M1
18925510,"Thrombopoietin following transfusion of platelets in preterm neonates.Thrombocytopenia is common in the neonatal intensive care unit. Transfusion of platelets is often required. The purpose of our study was to determine changes in thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>) following transfusion of platelets in preterm neonates. Preterm neonates undergoing platelet transfusion were randomized to receive a transfusion volume of either 10 or 15 ml/kg. Blood was obtained for Tpo measurement pre-transfusion, one and 24 hours post-transfusion. Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) was also measured to quantify platelet activation. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Ten infants were enrolled in each group. Gestational age, birth weight, etiology of thrombocytopenia, and timing of transfusion did not differ between the 10 and 15 ml/kg groups. There were no differences between the groups in platelet count prior to and/or following transfusion. Both transfusion volumes were equally well tolerated. Tpo and PF4 did not differ between groups at any of the study time points. When both groups were analysed together, Tpo dropped 43% (95% confidence 37-49%, p = 0.01) 1-hour post compared to pre-transfusion. In conclusion the observed decrease in Tpo following platelet transfusion suggests that Tpo kinetics in neonates is similar to adults following transfusion. PF4 was not affected by transfusion. There was not an increase in platelet count following transfusion volume of 15 ml/kg compared to 10 ml/kg.",M1
18845793,"Pronounced thrombocytosis in transgenic mice expressing reduced levels of Mpl in platelets and terminally differentiated megakaryocytes.We generated mice expressing a full-length Mpl transgene under the control of a 2-kb Mpl promoter in an Mpl(-/-) background, effectively obtaining mice that express full-length Mpl in the absence of other Mpl isoforms. These mice developed thrombocytosis with platelet levels approximately 5-fold higher than wild-type controls and markedly increased megakaryocyte numbers. The reintroduction of one wild-type Mpl allele restored normal platelet counts. We excluded the deletion of Mpl-tr, a dominant-negative isoform, as the underlying molecular cause for thrombocytosis. Instead, we found that transgene expression driven by the 2-kb Mpl promoter fragment was decreased during late megakaryocyte maturation, resulting in strongly diminished Mpl protein expression in platelets. Because platelets exert a negative feedback on thrombopoiesis by binding and consuming <e>Tpo</e> in the circulation through Mpl, we propose that the severe reduction of Mpl protein in platelets in Mpl-transgenic Mpl(-/-) mice shifts the equilibrium of this feedback loop, resulting in markedly elevated levels of megakaryocytes and platelets at steady state. Although the mechanism causing decreased expression of Mpl protein in platelets from patients with myeloproliferative disorders differs from this transgenic model, our results suggest that lowering Mpl protein in platelets could contribute to raising the platelet count.",M1

CD34(+) cells were isolated from fresh or cultured MNC using miniMACS magnetic separation system. Then 4x10(5) CD34(+) cells together with 5x10(6) CD34(-) cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. After transplantation, the dynamics of hematopoieitc recovery in the mice were measured. After 6 weeks, bone marrow (BM) and spleen samples were obtained from mice for detecting human cells. RESULTS: The number of total cells increased 1.78-fold after 14 d of culture. All recipients received fresh and cultured CD34(+) cells survived. Human cells, human lineage cells and human ALU sequence could be detected in BM and spleen. The peripheral blood counts of all transplanted mice recovered. The engraftment levels of cultured CD34(+) cells were similar to those of fresh CD34(+)cells but the percentage of human lineage cells was higher than that of fresh CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSION: CD34(+) cells cultured for 14 d still preserved the hematopoietic reconstitution ability and showed better multilineage reconstitution ability than fresh CD34(+) cells.",M1

The aim of our work was to determine the role of an impaired erythropoietin (EPO) and thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) production in development of, respectively, the anaemia and thrombocytopaenia in children with malignancy. Simultaneous dosage of EPO and of serum transferrin receptor have shown that anaemia in these patients is of central origin but related to a blunted EPO production. The same observation has been made in children at diagnosis either with acute leukaemia or solid tumour as well as during chemotherapy. In patients under maintenance chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, using long-term bone marrow cultures, we could detect an impaired supportive capacity of bone marrow micro-environment for erythropoiesis. The last part of this work has shown that thrombocytopaenia associated with acute leukaemia in children is accompanied by very high TPO levels as observed in other thrombocytopaenia of central origin, excepted in patients with acute leukaemia of myeloid origin. In these patients, TPO levels are inappropriately low in most cases. The low TPO levels are related to the presence of TPO receptor-expressing myeloid leukaemic cells, suggesting that TPO is  consumed  by blast cells expressing a functional TPO receptor.",M1
18814950,"Thrombopoietin regulates c-Myb expression by modulating micro RNA 150 expression.OBJECTIVE: Mice harboring c-Myb hypomorphic mutations display enhanced thrombopoiesis because of increased numbers of megakaryocytes and their progenitors. Thrombopoietin induces these same effects, which lead us to hypothesize that the hormone acts through modulation of c-Myb expression, as c-Myb levels falls during thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocyte (MK) maturation. Micro RNAs (miRs) downregulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs); we noted that the 3'UTR of c-Myb contains four miR-150 binding sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and reporter gene analyses to assess the response of c-Myb to thrombopoietin stimulation and to gain of and loss of miR-150 expression. RESULTS: We found that thrombopoietin reduced c-Myb mRNA and protein levels within 7 hours in megakaryocytes and UT7/thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) cells. Using a reporter gene containing the c-Myb 3'UTR region, including its four miR150 binding sites, we found that expression of miR150 reduced luciferase expression to 50% of baseline at 24 hours and to 25% at 48 hours in UT7/TPO cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting also revealed that miR-150 reduced endogenous c-Myb mRNA and protein to 50% in UT7/TPO cells, and to 65% in mature megakaryocytes. Converse experiments utilizing anti-miR150 increased luciferase activity twofold over control anti-miR. Finally, TPO increased miR150 expression 1.8-fold within 24 hours and 3.4-fold within 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish that miR150 downmodulates c-Myb levels, and because TPO affects miR150 expression, our results indicate that, in addition to affecting MK progenitor cell growth, TPO downmodulates c-Myb expression through induction of miR-150.",M1
18804163,"Inhibition of GSK-3beta promotes survival and proliferation of megakaryocytic cells through a beta-catenin-independent pathway.The interaction of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) with its receptor c-Mpl initiates intracellular signals that are critical for megakaryopoiesis. Previously we and others have shown that TPO activates PI3K and Akt and that this pathway is important for megakaryocyte growth. Here, we investigate the importance of the Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta in TPO signaling. GSK-3beta is phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt as part of the PI3K pathway. GSK-3beta can also be inhibited by Wnt signaling through a distinct mechanism, leading to reduced phosphorylation and accumulation of the transcription factor beta-catenin. Therefore, we asked if TPO and Wnt3a can both inhibit GSK-3beta in megakaryocytic cells, and if they can act synergistically to promote cell growth. Although both TPO and specific chemical inhibitors of GSK-3beta result in increased survival and proliferation in a megakaryocytic cell line model, treatment with Wnt3a failed to increase cell growth either in the absence or presence of TPO, despite inducing high levels of beta-catenin. Similarly, expression of a constitutively active version of beta-catenin did not increase cell growth either in the absence or presence of TPO, suggesting that the effects of GSK-3beta inhibition downstream of TPO signaling are distinct from those induced by Wnt3a and independent of beta-catenin. The growth promoting effects of TPO are not mediated by either of the two known GSK-3beta targets, cyclin D or HIF-1alpha. We conclude that GSK-3beta is phosphorylated and inhibited by TPO-induced Akt, promoting survival and proliferation in megakaryocytic cells through a pathway that does not involve beta-catenin.",M1
18796624,"Incomplete restoration of Mpl expression in the mpl-/- mouse produces partial correction of the stem cell-repopulating defect and paradoxical thrombocytosis.Expression of Mpl is restricted to hematopoietic cells in the megakaryocyte lineage and to undifferentiated progenitors, where it initiates critical cell survival and proliferation signals after stimulation by its ligand, thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). As a result, a deficiency in Mpl function in patients with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) and in mpl(-/-) mice produces profound thrombocytopenia and a severe stem cell-repopulating defect. Gene therapy has the potential to correct the hematopoietic defects of CAMT by ectopic gene expression that restores normal Mpl receptor activity. We rescued the mpl(-/-) mouse with a transgenic vector expressing mpl from the promoter elements of the 2-kb region of DNA just proximal to the natural gene start site. Transgene rescued mice exhibit thrombocytosis but only partial correction of the stem cell defect. Furthermore, they show very low-level expression of Mpl on platelets and megakaryocytes, and the transgene-rescued megakaryocytes exhibit diminished TPO-dependent kinase phosphorylation and reduced platelet production in bone marrow chimeras. Thrombocytosis is an unexpected consequence of reduced Mpl expression and activity. However, impaired TPO homeostasis in the transgene-rescued mice produces elevated plasma TPO levels, which serves as an unchecked stimulus to drive the observed excessive megakaryocytopoiesis.",M1

18773906,"Lesion-targeted thrombopoietin potentiates vasculogenesis by enhancing motility and enlivenment of transplanted endothelial progenitor cells via activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6kinase signaling pathway.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), a physiological regulator of megakaryocyte and platelet development, is a multifunctional positive regulator in early hematopoiesis by hematopoietic stem cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of TPO on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) for therapeutic vasculogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and the intracellular signaling mechanism exerting the activity of EPCs. 7-day culture-expanded EPCs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were applied to each assay. Flow cytometry demonstrated the expression of c-Mpl, the receptor of TPO, in cultured EPCs. In vitro experiments revealed enhanced migration and survival of cultured EPCs by TPO. In vivo, TPO was intramuscularly administered into the foci of ischemic hindlimbs in athymic nude mice, immediately followed by intravenous injection of cultured EPCs, to assess the booster effect of TPO on vascular regeneration. At day 4 post-transplantation, transplanted EPCs were 1.7-fold higher in TPO-treated animals compared to control. At day 28, blood perfusion was recovered in the TPO-treated group, accompanied by an increase in microvascular density. The signaling transduction pathway underlying TPO-mediated activities of cultured EPCs was assessed by Western blotting. TPO induced sequential phosphorylations of Akt to p70S6kinase through mTOR. Inhibition of the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/p70S6kinase signaling pathway negated the biological functions of cultured EPCs, either migration (by LY294002 for PI3-kinase and Rapamycin for mTOR) or survival and tubulogenesis (by Rapamycin). These findings provide evidence that TPO possesses booster potential for therapeutic vasculogenesis, by activating the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/p70S6kinase pathway crucial to the biological activities of EPCs.",M1
18753991,"Thrombopoietin level in patients with chronic liver diseases.Thrombocytopenia and oxidative stress are the most frequent problems in patients with chronic liver diseases as viral cirrhosis and schistosomiasis. So, this study aimed to evaluate the role of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) on the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and in differentiation between these diseases. It also aimed to investigate the relation between TPO, oxidative stress and antioxidant status in these two types of chronic liver disease. So, We measured serum TPO level, lipid peroxide (MDA) and serum total antioxidant activity (TAO) in 40 patients with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus and 37 patients with schistosomiasis from The Specialized Medical Hospital, Mansoura University. Results: Both serum TPO level and serum TAO activity were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in thrombocytopenic patients with viral cirrhosis when compared to both non thrombocytopenic and control groups. In contrast, TPO level was within the normal range in the patients with scistosomiasis either thrombocytopenic or not. while serum TAO activity was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in both thrombocytopenic and non thrombocytopenic patients with schistosomiasis in comparison to control subjects with no significant difference between these two subgroups. Serum MDA concentration was increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in all diseased groups when compared to controls with significant increase in thrombocytopenic patients as compared to non thrombocytopenic. Conclusion: TPO hypoproduction played a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of viral cirrhosis associated with thrombocytopenia. Also, total antioxidant activity and MDA are useful markers for monitoring patients with these chronic liver diseases.",M1
18718077,"[Effects of different doses of thrombopoietin on proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in mice]To explore the effect of different doses of thrombopoietin on proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in mice, 20 Kunming mice (35 +/- 5 g) were divided randomly into 4 groups: low-dose <e>TPO</e> group, moderate-dose TPO group, high-dose TPO group and normal control group (n = 5). The experimental groups were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of TPO at a dose of 25, 50, 100 microg/kg, respectively, and normal control group were treated with saline at a dose of 0.1 ml/g per day for 5 days. The bone marrow was harvested on 12 hours after the final administration. The bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) were counted and seeded at a density of 10(6) cells/cm(2). The colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) of MSCs was cultured and evaluated. The CFU-F of MSCs underwent osteo-genic induction and adipogenic induction, and cytochemical and immunocytochemical staining were performed to verify their multipotential. CFU-F and the cell percentage of CD90(+), CD105(+), CD34(+) in BMNCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that the number of BMNCs and the cell percentage of CD90(+), CD105(+), CD34(+) and CFU-F increased obviously in TPO groups as compared with the normal control group (p &lt; 0.05). The number of BMNCs increased most obviously in the 50 microg/kg TPO group. However, there was no significant difference in number of CFU-F between 50 microg/kg and 100 microg/kg TPO group (p &gt; 0.05). The CFU-F of MSCs in bone marrow had their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potentials in vitro. It is concluded that the number of BMNCs and the cell percentage of CD90(+), CD105(+) and CFU-F increased after administration with TPO. It means that TPO can enhance MSCs to proliferate in bone marrow. However, the number of BMNCs and CFU-F can not increase with the increase of TPO dose.",M1
18684867,"Point mutation in the gene encoding p300 suppresses thrombocytopenia in Mpl-/- mice.In an N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen using Mpl(-/-) mice, we isolated a semidominant suppressor of thrombocytopenia, termed Plt6. The gene mutated in Plt6 mice encodes the transcriptional coregulator p300, and the mutation, a tyrosine to asparagine substitution at amino acid 630 (Y630N), disrupts the interaction between p300 and c-Myb. Mpl(-/-) p300(Plt6/+) mice displayed elevated platelet counts relative to Mpl(-/-) p300(+/+) controls, whereas mice homozygous for the Plt6 mutation produced supraphysiological levels of circulating platelets. On a wild-type genetic background, mice homozygous for the p300(Plt6) mutation, or recipients of Mpl(+/+) p300(Plt6/Plt6) bone marrow, also exhibited thrombocytosis as well as deficiencies in B-lymphoid cells. Increased platelet numbers in Plt6 mutant mice were accompanied by significant increases in megakaryocyte progenitor cells within the bone marrow and spleen with concomitantly elevated numbers of megakaryocytes. The expansion of megakaryocytopoiesis and suppression of Mpl(-/-) thrombocytopenia in Plt6 mutants is highly reminiscent of that observed in mice with mutations affecting the p300 partner protein c-Myb, suggesting an indispensable repressive role for the c-Myb/p300 transcriptional regulatory complex in megakaryocyte development, the inhibition of which allows substantial thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>)-independent platelet production.",M1
18673341,"In vitro clinical-grade generation of red blood cells from human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells.BACKGROUND: There is no appropriate alternative source of red blood cells (RBCs) to relieve the worsening shortage of blood available for transfusion. Therefore, in vitro generation of clinically available RBCs from hematopoietic stem cells could be a promising new source to supplement the blood supply. However, there have been few studies about the generation of clinical-grade RBCs by coculture on human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and various cytokine supplements, even though the production of pure RBCs requires coculture on stromal cells and proper cytokine supplements. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Umbilical cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with two cytokine sets of stem cell factor (SCF) plus interleukin-3 (IL-3) plus erythropoietin (EPO) and SCF plus IL-3 plus EPO plus thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) plus Flt-3 for 1 week, followed by coculture upon MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM) or CB for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Almost pure clinical-grade RBCs could be generated by coculturing with CB-MSCs but not BM-MSCs. Expansion fold and enucleation rate were significantly higher in coculture with CB-MSCs than BM-MSCs. Despite a 2.5-fold expansion of erythroblasts in the presence of TPO and Flt-3 for 8 days, the final RBC count was higher without TPO and Flt-3. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report on generating clinical-grade RBCs by in vitro culture with human MSCs and compared effectiveness of several cytokines for RBC production. This provides a useful basis for future production of clinically available RBCs and a model of erythropoiesis that is analogous to the in vivo system.",M1
18619724,"AKR-501 (YM477) in combination with thrombopoietin enhances human megakaryocytopoiesis.OBJECTIVE: AKR-501 (YM477) is an orally active thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) receptor agonist that mimics the biological effect of TPO in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that AKR-501 in combination with TPO has additive effect on megakaryocytopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized human peripheral blood CD34+ cells were cultured with AKR-501, TPO, or a combination of the two in serum-free liquid culture system. The numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells, megakaryocytic progenitor cells, and megakaryocytes were measured using flow cytometry. Further, the effect of AKR-501 on TPO binding to TPO receptor was examined. RESULTS: Both AKR-501 and TPO alone increased the number of megakaryocytes, and the maximum activities of AKR-501 and TPO were similar. Interestingly, in the presence of TPO concentrations producing maximal stimulation, the addition of AKR-501 increased the number of megakaryocytes to about 200% of that generated with TPO only. In the time course experiment, the combination of AKR-501 and TPO augmented the numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells and colony-forming unit in culture in the early stages. Thus, the combination of AKR-501 and TPO enhanced not only the differentiation into megakaryocytes, but also the expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Further, AKR-501 did not inhibit TPO binding to the TPO receptor. This result indicated the possibility that AKR-501 and TPO may act simultaneously on the TPO receptor, and this could be responsible for their additive effect of on megakaryocytopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AKR-501 would be useful for the treatment of thrombocytopenia even at high plasma levels of endogenous TPO following chemotherapy.",M1
18618018,"Lnk controls mouse hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and quiescence through direct interactions with JAK2.In addition to its role in megakaryocyte production, signaling initiated by thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) activation of its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus protooncogene (c-Mpl, or Mpl), controls HSC homeostasis and self-renewal. Under steady-state conditions, mice lacking the inhibitory adaptor protein Lnk harbor an expanded HSC pool with enhanced self-renewal. We found that HSCs from Lnk-/- mice have an increased quiescent fraction, decelerated cell cycle kinetics, and enhanced resistance to repeat treatments with cytoablative 5-fluorouracil in vivo compared with WT HSCs. We further provide genetic evidence demonstrating that Lnk controls HSC quiescence and self-renewal, predominantly through Mpl. Consistent with this observation, Lnk-/- HSCs displayed potentiated activation of JAK2 specifically in response to TPO. Biochemical experiments revealed that Lnk directly binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in JAK2 following TPO stimulation. Of note, the JAK2 V617F mutant, found at high frequencies in myeloproliferative diseases, retains the ability to bind Lnk. Therefore, we identified Lnk as a physiological negative regulator of JAK2 in stem cells and TPO/Mpl/JAK2/Lnk as a major regulatory pathway in controlling stem cell self-renewal and quiescence.",M1
18617523,"Functional and structural profiling of the human thrombopoietin gene promoter.Human thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is involved in cardiovascular disease as it regulates megakaryocyte development and enhances platelet adhesion/aggregation. The THPO promoter structure is still controversial. By reverse transcription-PCR, we confirm that THPO transcription is cell line-dependently initiated at two alternative promoters, which we newly designated P1a and P1. We subsequently electrophoretically scanned and resequenced these portions in 95 and 57 patients with cardiovascular disease, respectively, and identified seven variants (-1450/del58bp, C-920T [rs2855306], A-622G, C-413T [rs885838], C+5A, G+115A, and C+135T). After subcloning of 1032 bp of THPO P1 in pGL3-basic vector, five molecular haplotypes (MolHaps1-5) were observed: [A(-622)-C(-413)-C(+5)-G(+115); wild type (wt)], [A(-622)-T(-413)-C(+5)-G(+115)], [G(-622)-T(-413)-C(+5)-G(+115)], [A(-622)-C(-413)-A(+5)-G(+115)], [A(-622)-C(-413)-C(+5)-A(+115)], and analyzed in reporter gene assays in HEK293T and HepG2 cells. MolHaps 2, 4, and 5 were significantly more active than wt (all p values &lt; or =0.01) in HEK293T cells, MolHap3 exerted a substantial loss of promoter activity (p &lt; 0.0001 in HEK293T and p &lt; 0.01 in HepG2, compared with wt). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that A-622G and C-413T individually differed from MolHaps in their DNA-protein interaction patterns.

18552713,"Effects of sepsis on neonatal thrombopoiesis.We serially evaluated the effects of sepsis and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) on neonatal thrombopoiesis, using a panel of tests that included platelet counts, thrombopoietin concentrations (<e>Tpo</e>), circulating megakaryocyte progenitor concentrations (CMPs), and reticulated platelets (RPs). Variables analyzed included sepsis type, time after onset of sepsis, platelet counts, and gestational (GA) and postconceptional ages (PCA). Twenty neonates were enrolled. Ten had Gram-negative, six had Gram-positive, and four had presumed sepsis. Four neonates had NEC stage II or higher, and six developed thrombocytopenia. Overall, septic neonates had significantly elevated Tpo concentrations and circulating megakaryocyte progenitors. The highest Tpo levels were associated with Gram-negative or presumed sepsis. RP percentages were increased only in neonates with low platelet counts, while RP counts (RP% x platelet count) were elevated in neonates with high platelet counts. Our findings suggest that septic neonates up-regulate Tpo production, leading to increased megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet release, although the degree of upregulation is moderate. The changes in RP% and RP count most likely reflect increased thrombopoiesis with variable degrees of platelet consumption. In addition, our findings suggest that different factors, likely including level of illness and/or specific platelet or bacterial products, can down-regulate the magnitude of the thrombopoietic response.",M1
18550259,"Analysis of the temporal and concentration-dependent effects of BMP-4, VEGF, and <e>TPO</e> on development of embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm and blood progenitors in a defined, serum-free media.OBJECTIVE: To develop a robust serum-free (SF) system for generation of hemogenic mesoderm and blood progenitors from pluripotent cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintained in N2B27 supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 were induced to differentiate into Brachyury/T-expressing cells (measured using a green fluorescent protein reporter) and myeloid-erythroid colony-forming cells (ME-CFCs), by removing LIF, changing the base media formulation, and via the time- and concentration-dependent addition of other factors. RESULTS: Presence of 10 ng/mL BMP-4 permitted the emergence of cells expressing T and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, however, &lt;5% of the cells were double-positive on day 4. Adjusting the SF media formulation allowed only 5 ng/mL BMP-4 to yield 24% +/- 4% Brachyury-green fluorescent protein VEGFR-2(+) cells by day 4. These cells could develop into ME-CFC, producing 4.4 +/- 0.8 CFC per 1000 cells at day 8. We also examined the timing and concentration sensitivity of BMP-4, VEGF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) during differentiation. BMP-4 with 50 ng/mL TPO generated 232 +/- 48 CFC per 5 x 10(4) cells, similar to the serum-control, and this response could be enhanced to 292 +/- 42 CFC per 5 x 10(4) cells by early (between day 0-5), but not late (after day 5) VEGF treatment. CONCLUSION: Moving to SF systems facilitates directed differentiation by eliminating confounding signals. This article describes modifications to the N2B27 media that amplify mesoderm induction and extends earlier work defining blood progenitor cell induction from ESC with BMP-4, VEGF, and TPO.",M1

UCB-CD133(+) cells were purified from mononuclear cells (MNCs) by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and seeded in serum-free liquid culture medium supplemented with thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and stem cell factor (SCF) to expand MPCs. At day 0, 6, 10 and 14 of culture, the total cell number was counted and the dynamic changes of CD133, CD34, and CD41 antigen expression during ex vivo expansion were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). At different expansion times, the CD133(+) cells were collected and cultured in collagen semisolid medium to carry out CFU-MK colony culture. The incidence of CFU-MK was calculated and the morphology of MPCs and CFU-MK were detected by immunohistochemistry and Wright-Giemsa staining. The results showed that UCB-CD133(+) cells optimally expanded at day 7 with expansion multiple of 8.2 +/- 2.2 in serum-free liquid culture systems and the total cell number was expanded by 116-fold at day 14. At 10 days, each UCB-CD133(+) cell can form 2.5 +/- 1.0, 2.6 +/- 0.5 and 20.3 +/- 5.9 cells of CD133(+)CD41(+), CD34(+)CD41(+) and CD41(+) respectively, from which the number of CD133(+)CD41(+) and CD34(+)CD41(+) cells reach the highest. UCB-CD133(+) cells both before and after expansion could form CFU-MK, the total number of CFU-MK reached the peak from cells of 10 days expansion of UCB-CD133(+) cells and the expansion multiple of CFU-MK was 59.5 +/- 11.8. Immunohistochemical results indicated that the expanded megakaryocytic cells were immature and no sign of platelet formation. It is concluded that the human UCB-CD133(+) cells have a high ability of MPC expansion, 10 days of culture can be result in optimal expansion effect.",M1
18549331,"The role of AMG-531 in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndromes.Thrombocytopenia can be seen in a variety of disease states, including immune mediated thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The most concerning complication is the development of hemorrhagic complications that may contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. The ligand thrombopoeitin (<e>TPO</e>) and its interaction with its receptor (c-mpl) are important in platelet production. Thrombopoietic agonists can help in the management of thrombocytopenia related to these conditions. Amgen Megakaryopoiesis Protein 531 (AMG-531) (Romiplostim) is a recombinant TPO with a peptide fragment that shares no sequence homology with endogenous TPO, preventing the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent studies have shown that it is effective in raising platelet counts, and is well tolerated in ITP and MDS patients. In this review, we discuss thrombopoiesis regulation by TPO; the chemistry, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG-531 in animals and humans; the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to thrombocytopenia in ITP and MDS; and clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy in treating thrombocytopenia.",M1
18542044,"Megakaryocytes and platelets in experimentally induced renovascular hypertension (2K1C) in rats.INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is one of the most frequently occurring diseases worldwide. Approximately 10% of the population with hypertension reveals the secondary type of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the megakaryocyte-platelet system in the course of renovascular hypertension. MATERIAL/METHODS: An experimental model of hypertension in rats according to Goldblatt was used in the study. The experimental material (blood, bone marrow) was collected in the 4th, 8th, and 16th weeks of the study. Bone marrow megakaryocytes (MKs) were evaluated using immunohistochemical and morphometric methods. Blood platelets were analyzed based on their count (PLT) and mean volume (MPV). Plasma thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) concentration was also assessed. RESULTS: The investigation showed increased numbers of MKs 16 weeks after partial unilateral ligation of the renal artery. Statistically significant increase in platelet count, platelet mass, and the number of MK naked nuclei (NKs) as well as elevation of the circular deviation of the nuclei (CDN) of MKs accompanied the changes. MPV and TPO concentration did not change during the experiment. There was significant positive correlation between the increase in blood pressure and the numbers of MKs and NKs. The number of MKs correlated positively with PLT and CDN. Although TPO plasma level did not change significantly, there was marked negative correlation between plasma TPO concentration and PLT. CONCLUSIONS: Although features of intensified platelet turnover were not observed, on the basis of the study it can be assumed that the megakaryocytic system undergoes changes in the course of renovascular hypertension. This can contribute to blood platelet production and the development of possible hypertension complications.",M1
18496561,"Familial essential thrombocythemia with spontaneous megakaryocyte colony formation and acquired JAK2 mutations.Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by increased proliferation of megakaryocytes and elevated platelet count that usually occurs sporadically. We report a family with seven affected individuals in three generations, including one individual with a phenotype resembling polycythemia vera, a related disorder. Megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) colony formation occurred in the absence of added cytokines in cultures of peripheral blood from affected family members. Some reports of familial ET have identified mutations in THPO and MPL, the genes for a cytokine (thrombopoietin, <e>TPO</e>) that regulates platelet production and its receptor (c-MPL), respectively. In this family, the MPL gene was excluded by linkage analysis. Although TPO levels were elevated in most affected family members and evidence for linkage was found between the disease and THPO (theta=0.0, Z(max)=3.0), a THPO mutation was not identified by DNA sequencing. The JAK2 V617F mutation that has been associated with 50% of sporadic cases of ET was identified as a somatic mutation, an acquired defect, in peripheral blood of the two most severely affected family members. These patients also had elevated TPO levels. Further study of familial myeloproliferative diseases will help elucidate the initiating genetic events underlying ET.",M1
18491948,"Extended in vitro expansion of adult, mobilized CD34+ cells without significant cell senescence using a stromal cell coculture system with single cytokine support.The macrophage colony-stimulating factor-deficient bone marrow stromal cell line OP9, derived from osteopetrotic mice, is known to support hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion as well as hematopoietic differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Coculture of HSC in the OP9 system requires cytokine support to achieve significant cell expansion. Recently, we reported extensive expansion without cell senescence of cord blood (CB)-derived HSC cocultured with OP9 stromal cells for more than 18 weeks with a single cytokine support using human thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the OP9/TPO coculture system to sustain long-term hematopoiesis of adult, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized human peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells. Maximum cell expansion was attained during the first 4 weeks of coculture. At the same time, the maximum progenitor cell expansion was demonstrated by the production of colony-forming cells and cobblestone area-forming cells. In contrast to the expansion of CB CD34(+) cells, PB CD34(+) cells showed termination of cultures after 8 weeks, independent of the cell expansion rates attained. The evaluation of cell senescence by assessing the telomere length in most cultures showed no relevant telomere shortening, despite rapid decrease in telomerase activity. Interestingly, increases in telomere length were demonstrated. In conclusion, OP9/TPO system provides extensive stem cell expansion without concomitant telomere erosion for both CB and adult CD34(+) cells. Termination of adult CD34(+) cell cocultures seems to be independent of telomere length.",M1
18487512,"YRRL motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the thrombopoietin receptor regulate receptor internalization and degradation.Thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>), acting through the c-Mpl receptor, promotes the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and drives megakaryocyte differentiation. The proproliferation and survival signals activated by Tpo must therefore be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. In this work, we determined the mechanisms that control Tpo-stimulated c-Mpl internalization and defined the processes leading to its degradation. Stimulation of BaF-Mpl cells with Tpo leads to rapid, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), we found that inhibition of adaptor protein 2 (AP2), which mediates endocytosis of transmembrane proteins, strongly attenuates Tpo-stimulated c-Mpl internalization. AP2 interacts with YXXPhi motifs and we identified 2 such motifs in c-Mpl (Y(8)RRL and Y(78)RRL) and investigated Tpo-stimulated internalization of receptors bearing point mutations at these sites. After Tpo stimulation, internalization was greatly reduced in c-Mpl Y(78)F and c-Mpl Y(8+78)F, and these cell lines also exhibited increased proliferation and increased strength and duration of Jak2, STAT5, AKT, and ERK1/2 activation in response to Tpo. We also found that the Y(8)RRL motif regulates Tpo-stimulated lysosomal degradation of c-Mpl. Our data establishes that c-Mpl cytoplasmic YRRL motifs are responsible for both Tpo-mediated internalization via interactions with AP2 and lysosomal targeting after endocytosis.",M1
18476596,"[Effect of fibronectin-thrombopoietin gene modification on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Fn-<e>TPO</e> gene modification on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). METHODS: Retroviral vector containing Fn-TPO gene was constructed and bone marrow MSCs was modified by this vector. The transcription of Fn-TPO gene in MSCs was observed. The proliferation capacities, hematopoietic cells adhering capacities and TPO secretion capacities of gene modified MSCs were assayed respectively. Cord blood CD34 cells were seeded on the gene modified MSCs layers and several essential growth factors were added. After co-culturing in vitro for 7 days, the number of CD34 cells and their colony forming capacities were assayed by flow cytometry and semisolid culture assay. RESULTS: Retroviral vector containing Fn-TPO gene was successfully constructed and bone marrow MSCs were modified by this vector. Fn-TPO gene was expressed by bone marrow MSCs after gene modification. The viability of MSCs had no significant difference between pre- and post-gene-modification [(7.18 +/- 0.89) 10(4)/ml vs. (6.92 +/- 0.77) 10(4)/ml, P &gt; 0.05]. The hematopoietic cells adhering ability of gene modified bone marrow MSCs was reinforced(0. 188 +/- 0.018 vs. 0.167 +/- 0.017, P &lt; 0.01). The concentration of TPO in the MSCs culture supernatant raised from (5.58 +/- 0.37) ng/ml to (7.46 +/- 0.59) ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01) and did not significantly decline in a short-time period, but influenced by the growth status of MSCs. After co-culturing with gene modified MSCs for 7 days, the absolute number of nucleated cells, the percentage of CD34+ cells and the colony numbers of BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM were (29.9 +/- 2.7) x 10(4), (33.3 +/- 2.8)% , 109.3 +/- 4.1, 163.7 +/- 7.1, 13.3 +/- 1.5, respectively, being significantly higher than that co-cultured with non-modified MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Fn-TPO gene modification can improve the capacity of human bone marrow MSCs for hematopoietic cells adhering, TPO secretion and cord blood CD34 cells amplification.",M1
18473128,"Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) regulates HIF-1alpha levels through generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a master transcriptional regulator mediating the cellular adaptation to hypoxia. In addition, HIF-1 is also vital for the development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In a previous study we found that thrombopoietin (TPO), an important and non-redundant cytokine for HSC maintenance and expansion, induces HIF-1alpha expression in HSCs by enhancing the stability of HIF-1alpha under normoxic conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not yet fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms and found that TPO-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a crucial role in stabilization of HIF-1. Both ROS scavengers and inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport completely blocked HIF-1alpha induction by TPO in UT-7/TPO cells and in primary immature mouse bone marrow cells. We also found that TPO-induced HIF-1alpha induction was tightly coupled with glucose metabolism. Inhibition of glucose transporter or glycolytic enzyme blocked HIF-1alpha elevation of TPO. These results indicate that TPO induces HIF-1alpha expression in a manner very similar to that of hypoxia.",M1
18457458,"Novel thrombopoietic agents: a review of their use in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.The underlying problem in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has traditionally been recognized as accelerated platelet destruction. However, recent studies have provided evidence that the pathophysiology of ITP is more complex, and impaired platelet production has emerged as one of the mechanisms contributing to the thrombocytopenia. On these grounds, second-generation thrombopoietic agents have been used in clinical trials to stimulate platelet production in ITP patients who are not responsive to standard treatments. These new molecules bear no structural resemblance to thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) but still bind and activate the TPO receptor. Studies have been completed for two TPO receptor agonists: romiplostim (formerly AMG 531) and eltrombopag (formerly SB497115). Romiplostim is a recombinant protein defined as a peptibody. Results of phase I-II trials published recently demonstrated that romiplostim given as a weekly subcutaneous injection for 1-6 weeks results in doubling of platelet counts and an increase to &gt;50 x 10(9)/L in most treated patients with minimal adverse effects. Eltrombopag is an orally available, small organic compound. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial, ITP patients were given daily oral treatment with placebo or eltrombopag 50 mg. Platelet responses were observed in 59% of eltrombopag-treated patients and in 16% of patients in the placebo arm. No significant adverse events were seen. Other thrombopoietic agents in development, such as AKR-501 (formerly YM 477), appear promising in healthy volunteers. Ongoing phase III clinical trials will reveal the potential of these agents in the management of ITP prior to splenectomy and for long-term maintenance therapy, as well as their relative benefit compared with standard of care treatment.",M1
18456388,"Growth and maturation of megakaryocytes is regulated by Lnk/Sh2b3 adaptor protein through crosstalk between cytokine- and integrin-mediated signals.OBJECTIVE: Various cytokines and growth factors control the differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs). However, the mechanism regulating platelet release from MKs is not well understood. Here, we investigated a role of Lnk/Sh2b3, an intracellular adaptor protein, in megakaryopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Number of MK progenitor in bone marrow (BM) of wild-type or Lnk(-/-) mice and their sensitivity to thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) were determined in colony-forming unit assay. Using BM-derived wild-type or Lnk(-/-) MKs stimulated with TPO, activation of the signaling molecules was biochemically analyzed and effect of integrin stimulation on TPO signals was studied by addition of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). Platelet production from MKs in the presence of VCAM-1 was counted by flow cytometry and their morphological change was observed by time-lapse microscopy. RESULTS: Lnk(-/-) mice showed elevated platelets and mature MKs due to enhanced sensitivity of progenitors to TPO. Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by TPO was augmented and prolonged in Lnk(-/-) MKs while activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)3, Stat5, and Akt was normal. Wild-type MKs, but not in Lnk(-/-) MKs on VCAM-1 showed reduced Stat5 phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinases activation upon stimulation with TPO. Additionally, the presence of VCAM in culture accelerated spontaneous platelet release from mature wild-type MKs, but not from Lnk(-/-) MKs. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that contact of MKs with adhesion molecules via integrins might contribute to platelet release, which is under Lnk-mediated regulation of Stat-5 activation and show that Lnk functions in responses controlled by cell adhesion and in crosstalk between integrin- and cytokine-mediated signaling.",M1
18433919,"Thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease.Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;150,000/microL) is a common complication in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) that has been observed in up to 76% of patients. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 50,000/microL-75,000/microL) occurs in approximately 13% of patients with cirrhosis. Multiple factors can contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia, including splenic platelet sequestration, bone marrow suppression by chronic hepatitis C infection, and antiviral treatment with interferon-based therapy. Reductions in the level or activity of the hematopoietic growth factor thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) may also play a role. Thrombocytopenia can impact routine care of patients with CLD, potentially postponing or interfering with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including liver biopsy, antiviral therapy, and medically indicated or elective surgery. Therapeutic options to safely and effectively raise platelet levels could have a significant effect on care of these patients. Several promising novel agents that stimulate TPO and increase platelet levels, such as the oral platelet growth factor eltrombopag, are currently in development for the prevention and/or treatment of thrombocytopenia. The ability to increase platelet levels could significantly reduce the need for platelet transfusions and facilitate the use of interferon-based antiviral therapy and other medically indicated treatments in patients with liver disease.",M1
18432953,"Culture, expansion, and differentiation of murine megakaryocytes.Megakaryocytes (MKs) are the source of circulating platelets and are readily recognized by their large size and distinctive morphology. Their poor representation in hematopoietic tissues often requires considerable ex vivo expansion to generate cells for biochemical and cell biological studies. These experimental protocols describe the assessment of megakaryocytic potential within hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow by colony-forming assays and expansion and enrichment of MKs from cultured fetal liver or spleen or bone marrow cells. Although these MKs are not synchronized in their maturation, they can be enriched over an albumin step-gradient and one-third to one-half of recovered cells will typically elaborate proplatelets, the immediate precursors of blood platelets. Both protocols require recombinant thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) as a growth factor. Support Protocols describe methods for preparing fetal liver cells, identifying mature rodent MKs by staining for acetylcholinesterase activity, and staining (May-Grünwald-Giemsa) mixed populations on cytocentrifuged blood cell preparations.",M1
18422784,"Functional analysis of single amino-acid mutations in the thrombopoietin-receptor Mpl underlying congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare disorder that presents with severe thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The disease may develop into bone marrow aplasia. Genetic defects in the gene encoding the thrombopoietin (<e>Tpo</e>) receptor, MPL, are the cause of this disease. In a previous study, we identified four missense mutations in CAMT patients, predicting Arg102Pro, Pro136His, Arg257Cys and Pro635Leu. To investigate whether these mutations result in defective Tpo-binding and/or signalling, full-length wildtype and mutant MPL were transduced into K562 cells. Expression levels and the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways upon Tpo-binding were studied. The results predicted that MPL carrying the P136H or P635L mutation was not properly expressed, whereas the R102P and R257C mutations resulted in impaired signal transduction. Our results indicate that a severe clinical course may be expected when these mutations lead to absent Mpl expression or signalling in CAMT patients with missense mutations.",M1
18414650,"<e>TPO</e>, but not soluble-IL-6 receptor, levels increase after anagrelide treatment of thrombocythemia in chronic myeloproliferative disorders.Anagrelide is often used in the treatment of thrombocythemia in myeloproliferative disease (MPD), but information concerning effects of treatment on cytokines involved in regulation of blood platelet levels is limited. Here, we investigated serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) in relation to response to treatment with and plasma concentrations of anagrelide. Samples from 45 patients with thrombocythemia due to MPD (ET=31, PV=14), being treated with anagrelide for 6 months, were analyzed for TPO, sIL-6R and anagrelide levels. The mean baseline platelet count was 983x10(9)/L. A reduction of platelets to &lt;600 in asymptomatic or &lt;400 x 10(9)/L in symptomatic patients was defined as a complete remission (CR), a reduction with &gt;50% of baseline as partial remission, and &lt;50% reduction as failure. At 6 months, 35 patients were in CR, 1 had a partial remission and 9 were treatment failures. For all patients, there was an increase in TPO of 44% from baseline; this change was more pronounced for patients with partial remission and failure. sIL-6R levels did not change significantly. There was no correlation between levels of anagrelide and cytokine levels at 6 months, and changes of cytokine levels did not relate to changes of platelet counts. Thus, a pronounced increase of TPO levels after 6 months of anagrelide treatment indicated that this treatment affected a major regulatory mechanism for megakaryocyte and platelet formation in MPD.",M1
18413713,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl restricts development and functions of hematopoietic stem cells.Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent progenitors that give rise to all types of blood cells. In the present study, we document that HSC development and functions are negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (casitas B-cell lymphoma). HSCs of c-Cbl(-/-) mice exhibit augmented pool size, hyperproliferation, greater competence, and enhanced long-term repopulating capacity. Our mechanistic studies identified that c-Cbl(-/-) HSCs are hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) and display elevated levels of STAT5 phosphorylation, thus leading to increased c-Myc expression. In essence, our data unequivocally identify c-Cbl as a novel negative regulator of developmental and functional properties of HSCs.",M1

Although TPO is expressed in several different tissues, only in the bone marrow has the level of expression been reported to increase in response to reduced numbers of platelets. In these studies, we demonstrate that platelet granule proteins are able to transcriptionally repress TPO mRNA expression in a marrow stromal cell line as well as in primary bone marrow stromal cell cultures. Like TPO mRNA, secretion of TPO protein was also suppressed by serum treatment. Reporter gene constructs indicate that DNA elements located in an approximately 1.9-kb region between 250-bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site and the middle of the second intron are able to mediate the transcriptional repression.",M1

Our objective was to assess the promoting effect of proteoglycans in a serum-free culture condition using human cord blood CD34(+) cells. Highly purified proteoglycan (PG) extracted from the nasal cartilage of salmon heads and the nasal septum cartilage of a whale were applied to the ex vivo expansion of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis from placental and umbilical cord blood CD34(+) cells in serum-free cultures stimulated with a combination of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Each PG (0.5 and 5 mug) was applied to the culture with three different concentrations of TPO (50, 5 and 0.5 ng/ml) and IL-3 (100, 10 and 1 ng/ml). Both of the PGs showed no promoting effects on the mononuclear cell proliferation rate in any of the cultures. However, the whale-PG promoted the generation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes in the culture with a lower dose of cytokines, respectively. In addition, whale-PG led to a significant increase in CD42a(+) particles which seemed to be platelets. While the salmon-PG failed to promote such production in almost all of the cultures. Although whale-PG is an attractive molecule for the ex vivo expansion of human megakaryocytopoiesis, its action may depend on the glycosaminoglycans sulfation pattern and the ability of the binding affinity and the kinetics to interact with the cytokines and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.",M1

18211570,"Emerging strategies to treat chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a fairly common hematological disorder and is a minor disease for many affected patients; most are in good health, and many can tolerate low platelet counts without the need for treatment. For the majority of patients who do undergo treatment, first-line therapies, including corticosteroids, are effective in increasing platelet counts, although long-term use can be associated with adverse effects. Second-line therapies, such as immunosuppressants, have been largely untested in controlled studies of ITP patients. Like first-line therapies, splenectomy is effective for many patients; however, it is frequently avoided by physicians who prefer the use of alternative drug therapies due to concerns about safety risks and is often declined by patients reluctant to undergo surgery. Thus, approaches to avoid or defer the use of splenectomy have been actively pursued. An anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, can limit the production of autoantibodies, but reactivated viral infections have been reported with its use. Agents that directly stimulate platelet production, such as thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) receptor-binding agents, have shown promise in clinical trials of ITP patients as well as in hepatitis C virus-infected individuals with thrombocytopenia. Two TPO receptor agonists in advanced clinical development--eltrombopag and AMG 531--are discussed here. Both eltrombopag and AMG 531 appear to be effective in raising platelet counts and both have been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. However, potential safety issues with thrombopoietic growth factors include thrombocytosis, rebound thrombocytopenia, and increased bone marrow fibrosis. Further testing will determine which safety issues--if any--are of clinical concern.",M1
18211568,"New drugs for familiar therapeutic targets: thrombopoietin receptor agonists and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Various agents to treat immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have been developed on the principle that stimulating the thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) receptor would increase platelet production. First-generation agents--recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) and pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG rHuMGDF)--showed promise, but observations of antibody formation to PEG rHuMGDF led to the discontinuation of development of both agents. Second-generation agents--the TPO peptide mimetics, TPO non-peptide mimetics, and TPO agonist antibodies--have been developed to reduce or eliminate the problem of antigenicity. Clinical studies for some of these agents, such as AMG 531 (romiplosim, Nplate) and eltrombopag (Promacta), are demonstrating their relative safety and efficacy in increasing platelet counts in patients with ITP; AMG 531 and eltrombopag are in late-stage clinical development and are able to stimulate platelet production in patients with ITP. Some differences in safety profiles have been described and are undergoing further study. There are currently seven second-generation TPO receptor agonists that have been reported in the literature, representing the potential advantages--and continuing challenges--with this novel class of platelet-stimulating therapies for ITP and possibly thrombocytopenia in other disease states as well.",M1
18368597,"CFU-megakaryocytic progenitors expanded ex vivo from cord blood maintain their in vitro homing potential and express matrix metalloproteinases.BACKGROUND: In patients transplanted with cord blood (CB), prolonged thrombocytopenia is a major complication. However, this could be alleviated by supplementing the CB graft with ex vivo-expanded megakaryocytic progenitors (CFU-Meg), provided that the homing properties of these cells are not affected negatively by expansion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the in vitro homing potential of CFU-Meg progenitors expanded from CB and showed that the combination of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) with interleukin-3 (IL-3) used for expansion not only results in optimal proliferation of CFU-Meg but also protects these cells from apoptosis. Moreover, we found that ex vivo-expanded CFU-Meg maintained expression of the CXCR4 receptor throughout a 9-day culture and were chemoattracted towards a stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) gradient. They also expressed matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and membrane-type (MT) 1-MMP, and transmigrated across the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel. Finally, we observed that SDF-1 up-regulated the expression of both MMP-9 and MT1-MMP in CB CD34(+) cells and ex vivo-expanded CFU-Meg. DISCUSSION: We suggest that CB-expanded CFU-Meg, in particular those from day 3 of expansion, when their proliferation and in vitro homing potential are maximal, could be employed to supplement CB grafts and speed up platelet recovery in transplant recipients.",M1
18357391,"Platelet production and related pathophysiology in acute myelogenous leukemia at first diagnosis: prognostic implications.Among various laboratory and clinical features megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet (PLT) counts have been previously insufficiently evaluated for their prognostic significance in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). We studied several clinical and laboratory features of 108 first diagnosed AML patients in relation with their prognosis. Patients with favourable prognostic features were excluded from the study. This study focused on the prognostic impact of PLT counts and related molecular biology in AML patients at initial diagnosis. In particular, the PLT counts were correlated with the endogenous production of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), c-mpl expression, CD34+ leukemic blast cell proportion, cytogenetics, and a prognostic correlation was established. We found that the most favorable prognosis appeared in the AML patient group with PLTs &lt;25x10(9)/l and correlated to cytogenetic findings (normal or abnormal karyotypes), while by far the most unfavorable prognosis was found in the patient group with PLTs &gt; or =130x10(9)/l independent of the corresponding cytogenetics. It was demonstrated that AML patients with normal or elevated PLT counts at first presentation, may constitute a distinct patient group with particular characteristics such as higher levels of endogenous TPO production, high expression of CD34+ leukemic blast cells, higher expression of c-mpl and consequently low response to chemotherapy and a very poor prognosis. These correlations between PLTs production (megakaryothrombopoiesis), TPO serum levels and TPO receptor (c-mpl) expression may help in the determination of risk-adapted AML patient groups and of targeted therapeutic strategies.",M1

TPO was measured with Human TPO ELISA Kit. In 7 of 8 patients with LT, IPF increased prior to the elevation of platelet counts.

18314349,"A step-wise approach significantly enhances protein yield of a rationally-designed agonist antibody fragment in E. coli.Fab59 is a rationally-designed antibody fragment (Fab) that mimics the activity of the cytokine thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). Fab59 activity was initially detected directly from bacterial supernatants in a cell-based assay and was subsequently estimated to be equipotent to TPO using purified material. However, the expression of Fab59 was insufficient to support in vivo characterization of the Fab due to extremely low expression levels from its initial phage display expression vector. To boost expression, a new expression vector was designed and constructed, and Fab59 light chain codons were optimized for bacterial expression. However, from this a new challenge arose, in that the codon-optimized Fab59 was more toxic to Escherichia coli cells than parental Fab59. Co-expression of the bacterial chaperon protein Skp alleviated this toxicity. A two-step purification method was used to isolate monomeric Fab59 from the periplasm. Although Fab59 was prone to form aggregates during the purification process, buffer modification efficiently eliminated this problem. Overall, optimization of Fab59 expression and purification achieved a 100-fold increase in Fab59 production in E. coli relative to the starting yield. The yield of purified monomeric Fab59 from a shake flask reached up to 3.5mg/L, which was sufficient to support testing of the agonist activity of purified monomeric Fab59 in vivo. Even higher yields may be achieved by purification of Fab present in the culture media, as Skp most significantly increased accumulation of Fab59 in that location.",M1
18314161,"Thrombopoietin levels increased in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.Hematological changes in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are common and frequently include thrombocytopenia.

In addition, the plasma from active SARS patients had an inhibitory effect on CFU-MK formation, which could be neutralized by anti-TGF-beta antibodies. In the experiment to determine whether SARS-CoV can directly infect hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytic cells, incubation of the cells with SARS-CoV did not show active infection. Our findings of increased TPO levels in the plasma of SARS patients provide a possible explanation for the genesis of thrombocytosis, which frequently develops from thrombocytopenia in SARS patients.",M1
18301302,"Thrombopoietin is a growth factor for rat hepatic progenitors.OBJECTIVE: The liver is the primary site of hematopoiesis during fetal development; it has been shown that thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) produced by the liver during fetal development is a major regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis. As maximum liver growth and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously, we hypothesized that TPO may act as a growth factor for hepatic progenitors. Therefore, the influence of TPO on the proliferation of fetal hepatic progenitors in vitro compared with that of adult hepatocytes was analyzed. The expression of the TPO receptor, c-mpl, was investigated in fetal and adult liver. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and total cell counts. TPO and c-mpl gene expression was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cell surface expression of c-mpl was analyzed in fetal and adult human liver by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hepatic progenitors of fetal and adult liver but not hepatocytes expressed the TPO receptor, c-mpl, on the cell surface. Fetal hepatic progenitors expressed mRNA for TPO and its receptor. TPO stimulated cell proliferation and increased cell numbers of cultured rat fetal hepatic progenitors but not adult hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that TPO acts in addition to its known role in megakaryocytopoiesis as a growth factor for hepatic progenitors but not hepatocytes in vitro; thus, TPO represents a growth factor for hepatic progenitors during fetal liver development.",M1
18288130,"hNUDC promotes the cell proliferation and differentiation in a leukemic cell line via activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl).We have recently identified a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein (hNUDC) that binds specifically with the extracellular domain of thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). Preliminary studies with human CD34(+) cells cultured in serum-free medium and normal mice showed that hNUDC appears to act as a cytokine, triggering many of the same responses as thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>). More intriguingly, recent data gained using a NIH 3T3 system have demonstrated that hNUDC exerts its biological activities through activation of Mpl. In this study, we further compared the biological functions of hNUDC with TPO in an EPO-dependent UT-7 cell line that was engineered to express the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). These Mpl-expressing cells following stimulation by either hNUDC or TPO exhibited overlapping patterns of megakaryocytic proliferation and differentiation, manifested by cell morphological change, polyploidy and expression of CD41(+). Similar with TPO, hNUDC induced a sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) as well as p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways and these activations were inhibited in the presence of PD98059 or SB203580. Further evidence is provided that PD98059 or SB203580 inhibited hNUDC- or TPO-induced cell proliferation and differentiation, suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways are necessary in megakaryocyte development.",M1
18259214,"Minimally invasive and selective hydrodynamic gene therapy of liver segments in the pig and human.This paper highlights our experience of the transfer of hydrodynamic gene therapy (HGT) from the large animal, the pig, into clinical practice. The modification of balloon catheters and the development of a minimally invasive technique to allow selective isolation of liver segments for HGT in the large animal and human are described. Finally, our preliminary results from a phase I clinical study of HGT for thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) in cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia are discussed. Based on these provisional data, minimally invasive selective HGT of liver segments appears to be technically safe, but further work is required to optimize the efficiency of gene transfer in order to achieve clinical benefit.",M1
18256550,"PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a pathway contributes to thrombopoietin-induced proliferation of primary megakaryocytes in vitro and in vivo via modulation of p27(Kip1).Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), the primary regulator of megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet formation, modulates the activity of multiple signal transduction molecules, including those in the Jak/STAT, p42/p44 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. We previously demonstrated that PI3K and Akt are necessary for TPO-induced cell cycle progression of primary MK progenitors. However, the molecular events secondary to the activation of PI3K/Akt responsible for MK proliferation remain unclear. In this study we show that FOXO3a and its downstream target p27(Kip1) play an important role in TPO-induced proliferation of MK progenitors. We found that TPO down-modulates p27(Kip1) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in primary MKs in a PI3K dependent fashion. UT-7/TPO, a megakaryocytic cell line, stably expressing constitutively active Akt or a dominant-negative form of FOXO3a failed to reduce p27(Kip1) expression after TPO stimulation, and fail to induce p27(Kip1) expression following TPO withdrawal. Induced expression of an active form of FOXO3a resulted in increased p27(Kip1) expression in this cell line. In addition, the number of MKs is significantly increased in bone marrow from Foxo3a-deficient mice. Taken together with the previous observation that p27(Kip1)-deficient mice also display increased numbers of MK progenitors, our findings indicate that the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a/p27(Kip1) pathway contributes to normal TPO-induced MK proliferation.",M1
18243490,"Impact of chicken thrombopoietin and its receptor c-Mpl on hematopoietic cell development.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to identify and clone the first nonmammalian thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), chicken TPO, and its receptor c-Mpl for the purpose of characterizing their activities both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chicken TPO was cloned using the methods of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Northern blotting and RNAse protection assays were employed to analyze the levels of RNA expression in a panel of tissues and cell lines. To study cell surface expression of c-Mpl, polyclonal antibodies were prepared against bacterially derived c-Mpl. Both baculovirus-derived recombinant TPO and retrovirally expressed TPO and c-Mpl were used for the in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Both chicken TPO and its receptor c-Mpl were identified and cloned. Expression of chicken TPO was restricted to only the liver and spleen, while c-mpl was expressed in the bone marrow, lung, and spleen. In vitro experiments with sorted multipotent chicken bone marrow-derived progenitors demonstrated that TPO plays a role in the commitment of these cells to the thrombocytic lineage. Furthermore, TPO in cooperation with stem cell factor also supports proliferation of multipotent progenitors. In experimental animals, the intravenous application of recombinant chicken TPO or overexpression of TPO and c-mpl via retroviral infection lead to erythroblastosis and thromboblastosis. CONCLUSION: The characterized chicken thrombopoietin and its receptor c-Mpl will be valuable tools to further study thrombocytic differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell development. Moreover, the introduced experimental model of the chicken bipotent thrombo-/erythropoietic-progenitor can be used to identify key regulators of cell fate determination.",M1
18096471,"Thrombopoietin mimetic agents in the management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) is a potent endogenous cytokine and the principal regulator of platelet production. Advances in the understanding of the structure of TPO enabled development of the first generation of thrombopoietic growth factors, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) and pegylated human recombinant megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF). Clinical results showed that these agents were effective in promoting increases in platelet counts in a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders. However, clinical development was halted when studies demonstrated risk for autoantibody formation with cross-reactivity to endogenous TPO. A second generation of thrombopoietic growth factors, including TPO peptide and nonpeptide mimetics and TPO agonist antibodies, utilizing different mechanisms from recombinant growth factors to promote platelet production, are currently in development. The TPO peptide mimetic AMG 531 and the nonpeptide mimetic eltrombopag are in advanced clinical trials and have both resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelets in healthy subjects and in significant increases in platelets in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Clinical trials are also being conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag to treat thrombocytopenia in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals. These agents appear to be well tolerated and the formation of autoantibodies appears to be limited to first-generation growth factors. Increases in marrow reticulin have been demonstrated with some growth factors, but this appears to be a reversible phenomenon and is not associated with formation of collagen fibrosis. There appears to be no increased incidence of thrombotic events in patients who achieve high platelet counts with growth factor treatments, and although occasional thrombotic events have been reported, their association to the treatment is uncertain. While there is evidence that activation of signaling pathways involved in platelet production may result in reduction in the threshold for platelet activation, this appears to have minimal clinical relevance for the use of thrombopoietin growth factors.",M1
18203013,"Serum thrombopoietin compared with ZAP-70 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutation status as a predictor of time to first treatment in early chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an effort to confirm previous reports we analyzed clinico-biological implications of increased serum levels of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) in a series of 71 previously untreated Binet stage A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Serum levels of TPO did not correlate with peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p = 0.928), Rai substages (p = 0.516), platelet count (p = 0.572), hemoglobin level (p = 0.228), LDH (p = 0.144) and beta2-microglobulin (p = 0.520). The same applied when correlation with ZAP-70 (p = 0.562), CD38 (p = 0.258) or mutational status of IgV(H) (p = 0.0794) were sought. The risk of disease-progression according to known and putative prognostic parameters was also evaluated as time to first treatment (TFT). The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the absence of IgV(H) mutational status (p = 0.0005) and ZAP-70-positivity (p = 0.02) were associated with a shorter TFT. In contrast, Kaplan-Meier estimates of TFT, plotted after setting as cut-off the median value for TPO (i.e., 46 pg/mL), failed to demonstrate any statistical difference between two groups (p = 0.342). Looking for cellular source of TPO we investigated the presence of TPO at gene expression level in 60 B-CLL patients belonging to an independent series. Here we provide evidence for the presence of a low TPO gene expression transcript in B-CLL cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that in early B-cell CLL circulating level of TPO does not provide a useful insight into the complex interrelationship of prognostic variables.",M1
18095908,"New insights and therapeutics for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.In recent years, great advances have been made in elucidating the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and the mechanisms of thrombopoiesis. Drawing upon decades of basic science and clinical research, the pathways behind the immune-mediated destruction of platelets have opened new avenues. This has led to the application of safer and more efficacious immunosuppressive agents, such as the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, or potentially altering the co-stimulatory pathways of the immune system with an anti-CD40L (CD154) monoclonal antibody. This has been coupled with the discoveries of the genetic and molecular pathways in thrombopoiesis, including the identification and cloning of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) and its receptor. The use of recombinant TPO, such as PEG-rHuMGDF and rhTPO, to treat thrombocytopenia have paved the way for alternative peptidyl and nonpeptidyl thrombopoietic agents that are considered to be nonimmunogenic. Those that have undergone evaluation in humans include the Amgen megakaryopoiesis protein (AMG) 531 compound, eltrombopag, and AKR-501. Additional TPO mimetics show promise in vitro and await future development.",M1
18093840,"<e>TPO</e>-independent megakaryocytopoiesis.Megakaryocytopoiesis is a continuous developmental process of platelet production. In this process, a complex network of hemopoietic growth factors are involved, among which TPO (thrombopoietin) is the most thoroughly investigated regulator of MKs (megakaryocytes). In addition to TPO, other regulators also have non-negligible effects on megakaryocytopoiesis. The majority of their effects are independent of TPO signaling. To date, TPO-independent megakaryocytopoiesis forms a regulatory system that includes four signals and (an) unknown signaling pathway(s). These four pathways are the gp 130 (glycoprotein 130)-dependent signaling pathway, the Notch pathway, NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor-mediated signaling, and the SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1)/FGF-4 (fibroblast growth factor-4) paradigm. Understanding of the TPO-independent regulatory system is important because the system may offer additional opportunities to understand the developmental process and the mechanisms of disorders characterized by abnormal MK and platelet production, such as thrombocytopenia and thrombocythemia, and to advance the development of therapeutics.",M1
18088476,"[Engraftment of ex vivo expanded mononuclear cells from human umbilical cord blood in NOD/SCID mice]This study was purpose to explore the effect of combination of SCF, FL, <e>TPO</e> without serum and stroma on the ex vivo expansion of the mononuclear cells derived from umbilical cord blood (CB) and to evaluate the proper infused time and implantation of expanded cells. Mononuclear cells derived from CB were cultured with the combination of SCF, FL and TPO for 14 days. At 0, 7, 10 and 14 days, the total mononuclear cells in culture were counted, CD34+ cells and CD34+CXCR4+, CD34+CD49d+ cells were assayed by flow cytometry, and CFU were determined. Mononuclear cells from CB cultured for 7 days ex vivo in serum- and stroma-free medium containing FL+SCF+TPO were infused into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Six weeks after transplantation, the human cells were assessed by flow cytometry and PCR. The results showed that after culturing ex vivo in the presence of SCF+FL+TPO for 14 days, the total number of nuclear cells significantly increased in the early stage of culture, CD34+, CD34+CD49d+ cells reached a peak level at 7 days and then decreased, while the peak level of CFU, CD34+CXCR4+ cells was at 10 days, then decreased. Human hematopoietic cells could be detected in the marrow of the recipients at 6 weeks after infusion and the rate of success of NOD/SCID mice implanted with the expanded cells was higher than mice transplanted with fresh sample and control (p&lt;0.05). It is concluded that day 7-10 may be an optimal harvest time for transplantation. The expanded cells with FL+SCF+TPO can be engrafted into the bone marrow of sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. The engrafting potential of cord blood may be enhanced via up-regulating CXCR4 and CD49d expression on the CD34+ cells.",M1
18075837,"Signal processes and ROS production in glucose transport regulation by thrombopoietin and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulation factor in a human leukaemic cell line.In M07e cells, a human megakaryocytic leukaemia line, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in response to cytokines acting as intracellular messengers to modulate glucose transport. The aim of this work was to study the signal cascade involved in the acute glucose transport activation in cells exposed to growth factors, such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF) and thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>), to better understand some aspects of the aberrant proliferation in leukaemia. Results confirm ROS involvement in modulation of glucose transport in this cell line. Furthermore, GM-CSF and TPO produced changes in Glut1 phosphorylation and specific inhibitors employed to identify protein kinases involved in Glut activation by these cytokines proved that Akt, PLC gamma, Syk and the Src family take part in signal transduction leading to Glut1 activation.",M1
17958514,"Review article: thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease.BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in advanced liver disease. It is predominantly a result of portal hypertension and platelet sequestration in the enlarged spleen, but other mechanisms may contribute. The liver is the site of thrombopoietin (<e>TPO</e>) synthesis, a hormone that leads to proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes and platelet formation. Reduced TPO production further reduces measurable serum platelet counts. AIM: This paper describes the scope of thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease and assesses the clinical impact in this patient population. METHODS: A medline review of the literature was performed pertaining to thrombocytopenia and advanced liver disease. This data is compiled into a review of the impact of low platelets in liver disease. RESULTS: The incidence of thrombocytopenia, its impact on clinical decision making and the use of platelet transfusions are addressed. Emerging novel therapeutics for thrombocytopenia is also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia is a common and challenging clinical disorder in patients with chronic liver disease. New therapeutic options are needed to safely increase platelet counts prior to invasive medical procedures as well as to counteract therapies that further exacerbate low platelets, such as interferon. An ideal compound would be orally available and safe, with rapid onset of action.",M1
20413976,"Maternal thyroid function at 11-13 weeks of gestation.OBJECTIVE: To establish normal ranges of maternal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) at 11-13 weeks of gestation. METHODS: Maternal serum concentrations of FT3, FT4, TSH, anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibodies were measured at 11-13 weeks. Normal ranges were constructed from the data of singleton pregnancies with no anti-thyroid antibodies resulting in live births after 34 weeks of phenotypically normal neonates with birth weight above the 5th percentile. Adjustments were made for maternal characteristics found by multiple regression analysis to affect the levels of TSH, FT3 and FT4. RESULTS: 3,592 of the 4,318 pregnancies examined were antibody negative, and in this group serum TSH increased whereas FT3 and FT4 decreased with gestation, and all three were lower in black than in white women. Serum FT3 and FT4 decreased but TSH did not change significantly with maternal age; TSH and FT3 increased whereas FT4 decreased with body mass index; TSH decreased whereas FT3 and FT4 increased with serum free beta-hCG. In the antibody-positive group, compared to the negative group, median TSH was higher and median FT3 and FT4 were lower.

20145622,"Human recombinant anti-thyroperoxidase autoantibodies: in vitro cytotoxic activity on papillary thyroid cancer expressing <e>TPO</e>.BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancers are difficult to treat due to their limited responsiveness to chemo- and radiotherapy. There is thus a great interest in and a need for alternative therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: We studied the cytotoxic activity of anti-thyroperoxidase autoantibodies (anti-TPO aAbs, expressed in baculovirus/insect cell (B4) and CHO cells (B4') or purified from patients' sera) against a papillary thyroid cancer (NPA) cell line. Anti-TPO aAbs from patients' sera led to a partial destruction of NPA cell line by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and exhibited an anti-proliferative activity. Comparison of the cytotoxic activity of anti-TPO aAbs shows that B4' induced an anti-proliferative effect and a better ADCC than B4, but a lower one than anti-TPO aAbs from patients' sera. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was increased when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effector cells, suggesting that FcgammaRs, CD64, CD32 and CD16 are involved. Indeed, anti-TPO aAbs from patients' sera, but not B4 and B4', exhibited CDC activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that anti-TPO aAbs display moderate ADCC and anti-proliferative activities on NPA cells; IgG glycosylation appears to be important for cytotoxic activity and ADCC efficiency depends on FcgammaR-bearing cells. Finally, recombinant human anti-TPO aAbs cannot yet be considered as an optimal tool for the development of a novel therapeutic approach for thyroid cancer.",M2
20110527,"Prevalence of autoantibodies in SAPHO syndrome: a single-center study of 90 patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the most often tested autoantibodies in synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. METHODS: We identified 90 patients seen in our unit between June 2002 and June 2009, and diagnosed according to the proposed criteria for SAPHO syndrome. Demographic and clinical data were collected as well as immunological results, including antinuclear, antithyroid peroxydase (<e>TPO</e>), antithyroid globulin (Tg), antigastric parietal cell, antismooth muscle, antimitochondria, and anti-liver-kidney microsome (LKM) antibodies. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were analyzed in 69 patients, antibodies to soluble extractable nuclear antigens in 43, anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies in 22 [depending on the type of fluorescence of antinuclear antibody (ANA)], and antiendomysium antibodies in 55. RESULTS: Autoantibodies were found in 20 patients (22.2%): 14 patients (15.5%) had positive ANA (titer &gt;/= 1/160); among them, 10 (11%) patients never took a lupus-inducing drug. Antithyroid antibodies (anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg antibodies) were found in only 3 patients (3.3%). Three patients (3.3%) were positive for antigastric parietal cell antibodies and 4 (4.4%) were weakly positive for antismooth muscle antibodies. Antimitochondria and LKM antibodies were negative in all 90 patients. Anti-CCP and anti-dsDNA antibodies were negative in the 69 and 22 patients tested, respectively. One out of 43 patients (2.3%) had anti-SSA antibodies. Antiendomysium antibodies were negative in the 55 patients tested. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates an increased prevalence of autoantibodies in SAPHO syndrome, with no specific profile. We failed to confirm the reports of an increased prevalence of antithyroid antibodies. These results tend to support a link between autoimmunity and SAPHO syndrome.",M2

20101889,"Thyroid peroxidase gene mutations causing congenital hypothyroidism in three Turkish families.In Turkey congenital hypothyroidism (CH) occurs with a prevalence of one in 2,736 newborns while the worldwide incidence is one in 3,000-4,000 newborns. 85-90% of these cases are due to dysgenesis of the thyroid gland, whereas defects in thyroid hormone synthesis account for 10-15%. The majority of patients with dyshormonogenesis have a defect in thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>). To date, more than 60 different mutations have been described in the TPO gene, mostly single nucleotide substitutions. Five children from three consanguineous families were diagnosed with CH on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs--goiter, macroglossia and prolonged jaundice at newborn age. Two different mutations in the TPO gene were identified. Affected children in families I and II had a nonsense mutation in exon 10 (R540X). Genotyping of polymorphic markers within the TPO gene revealed that these families shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. In the third family, a novel mutation (G319R) in exon 8 was identified.",M2
20036902,"Hemostatic gene polymorphisms in young Sardinian with non-fatal acute myocardial infarction.Although the role of environmental factors in the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been clearly established, the role of genetic factors is still undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between various gene polymorphisms in the haemostatic system and the risk of myocardial infarction in a very genetic restricted area population of Sardinian young adults with AMI. The study case-control involved 71 patients who had survived a first MI at a mean age of 47,2 years and 150 healthy subjects. No differences in the allele or genotype frequencies were seen between the study groups for the fibrinogen, prothrombin, factor V, factor VII, vWF, TM, PAI-1, <e>TPO</e> gene, and PLA and HPA-2 genes polymorphisms. Indeed differences statistically significant were detected for A5709G in the TPO gene (P= 0,041), and I/D dimorphism in the eNOS gene (P= 0,016). We therefore conclude that among all the investigated polymorphisms only the 5709G and eNOS4a alleles seem to confer protection against MI in the young age of Sardinian people.",M2
19960894,"Final diagnosis in children with subclinical hypothyroidism and mutation analysis of the thyroid peroxidase gene (<e>TPO</e>).AIM: To determine the final diagnosis of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), and to perform mutation screening of the thyroid peroxidase gene (TPO). METHODS: Infants with SCH without an identified etiology were included in the study. Patients with thyroid dysgenesis were excluded. Children &gt; or = 2 years of age, and still on L-thyroxine (LT4) treatment underwent a diagnostic algorithm. After LT4 was discontinued for 4 weeks, thyroid function tests (TFT) were obtained. A perchlorate discharge test (PDT) was performed in patients with normal thyroid ultrasound but abnormal TFT. Sequence analysis of TPO was studied in all children who underwent a PDT. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (23 males and 25 females) completed the trial. Among these children, 19 (39.5%) had transient SCH, and 29 (60.5%) had permanent SCH. Among patients with permanent SCH, 19 had thyroid hypoplasia, six had partial iodide organification defect with positive PDT, and four had other dyshormonogenesis with negative PDT. Mean LT4 dose before the medication ceased was 1.2 +/- 0.5 microg/kg/day in transient cases, and 1.7 +/- 0.4 in those with permanent SCH (p &lt; 0.05). No TPO mutation was detected. However, in five patients, seven different previously known TPO polymorphisms were detected: c.102C &gt; G, L4L; &gt; A, A576A; c.2088C &gt; T, D666D; c.2263A &gt; C, T725P; c.2630 T &gt;C, V847A. CONCLUSIONS: LT4 treatment should be stopped after the age of 2 years in infants with SCH without a definite pathology of the thyroid gland to exclude cases with transient hypothyroidism. Additionally, we should consider particularly thyroid gland hypoplasia, and also partial defects in iodide organification in infants with SCH.",M2
19952225,"Association of duoxes with thyroid peroxidase and its regulation in thyrocytes.CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone synthesis requires H(2)O(2) produced by dual oxidases (Duoxes) and thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>). Defects in this system lead to congenital hypothyroidism. H(2)O(2) damage to the thyrocytes may be a cause of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether Duox and TPO, the H(2)O(2) producer and consumer, might constitute a complex in the plasma membrane of human thyroid cells, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing leakage and damage. DESIGN: The interaction between Duox and TPO was studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of plasma membranes from incubated follicles prepared from freshly resected human thyroid tissue from patients undergoing thyroidectomy, and COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the entire Duoxes or truncated [amino (NH2) or carboxyl (COOH) terminal]. RESULTS: The following results were reached: 1) Duox and TPO from membranes are coprecipitated, 2) this association is up-regulated through the Gq-phospholipase C-Ca(2+)-protein kinase C pathway and down-regulated through the Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, 3) H(2)O(2) increases the association of Duox1 and Duox2 to TPO in cells and in membranes, and 4) truncated NH(2)- or COOH-terminal Duox1 and Duox2 proteins show different binding abilities with TPO. CONCLUSION: Coimmunoprecipitations show that Duox and TPO locate closely in the plasma membranes of human thyrocytes, and this association can be modulated by H(2)O(2), optimizing working efficiency and minimizing H(2)O(2) spillage. This association could represent one part of a postulated pluriprotein complex involved in iodination. This suggests that defects in this association could impair thyroid hormone synthesis and lead to thyroid insufficiency and cell damage.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sera from 240 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and from 124 with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) were examined. The sera from 40 healthy donors served as a control. The sera were screened for anti-TG and anti-TPO autoAB, anti-TGPO autoAB, by employing enzyme immunoassay and/or radioimmunoassay. The results were statistically processed using the variation statistics-based programs. RESULTS: The specific features of an autoantigenic component to thyroid tissues were found in the sera of patients with AIT and DTG. An association was established between the progression of disease and the phasic change of autoAB populations or their combinations.

19942155,"Environmental pollutants and the thyroid.Common environmental exposures may affect thyroid function in humans. Foetuses and infants are most vulnerable to these effects because they need thyroid hormone for normal neurodevelopment. Perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate are all competitive inhibitors of the sodium/iodine symporter (NIS) in pharmacologic doses, but their effects on human thyroid function at environmental exposure levels remain unclear. Many compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), bisphenol-A (BPA) and triclosan, may have direct actions on the thyroid hormone receptor, but these effects are complex and are not yet well understood. Isoflavones inhibit thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) activity, and, therefore, may cause goitre and hypothyroidism if ingested at high levels, particularly in iodine-deficient individuals. Organochlorine pesticides and dioxins may decrease serum T(4) half-life by activating hepatic enzymes. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the risk posed by these and other potentially thyroid-disrupting compounds.",M2
19824863,"Factors for thyroid autoimmunity in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with an autoimmune reaction to thyroid antigens including thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (anti-Tg). AIMS: We determined in children with T1DM the relationship of positive anti-thyroid antibodies to potential risk factors, including, age, gender, duration of diabetes, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 144 children and adolescents with T1DM. Their age was 12.3 +/- 4.6 (mean +/- SD) years, and duration of diabetes was 4.6 +/- 3.8 years. Anti-thyroid antibodies were determined using a luminescence method and anti-GAD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anti-thyroid antibodies among the children with T1DM in our study were: anti-TPO (17.4%), anti-Tg (11.1%), and of both anti-thyroid antibodies (10.4%). The presence of serum anti-thyroid antibodies was positively associated with age (16.6 years in those with positive tests versus 12.0 years in those with negative tests, P = 0.027), duration of diabetes (7.4 versus 4.3 years, P = 0.031), and serum TSH (Thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels (4.8 versus 2.3 microIU/mL, P = 0.002). The presence of both anti-thyroid antibodies was associated with female sex (boys: 4/75 (5.3%), girls: 11/69 (15.9%), chi-square = 6.44, P = 0.04). Subclinical autoimmune thyroiditis (SAIT) was present in 55.5% of the patients with thyroid antibody-positivity and was positively associated with age (16.6 versus 12.0 years, P = 0.001) and diabetes duration (7.6 versus 4.2 years, P = 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the development of anti-thyroid antibodies was predicted by: 1) the presence of anti-GAD (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.92), 2) the presence of a second anti-thyroid antibody (OR 134.4, 95% CI 7.7-2350.3), and 3) older age (OR 22.9, 95% CI 1.13-463.2). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid autoimmunity was associated with female gender, increasing age, long diabetes duration, the persistence of anti-GAD, and with TSH elevation, indicating subclinical hypothyroidism.",M2
19798875,"Cervical lymphadenopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: an analysis of 22 cases by fine needle aspiration cytology.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the possible association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and cervical lymphadenopathy in cases diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. STUDY DESIGN: Among the patients referred to our laboratory for ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules (USG-FNAC), cases of HT associated with cervical lymphadenopathy were evaluated. RESULTS: Between February 2001 and May 2007, HT was diagnosed in 94 (11%) of a total of 856 thyroid USG-FNAC cases. Among these cases, 22 (23%) were associated with single/ multiple cervical lymphadenopathy. In all cases, FNAC of the lymph nodes was consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Anti-<e>TPO</e> and anti-Tg antibody results were obtained in 14 of 22 cases with HT. Among these cases, 12 showed positive values. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and cytopathologists who encounter thyroid nodules with cervical lymphadenopathy should also include the possibility of HT in the differential diagnosis. A literature search disclosed no report regarding the possible association between HT and cervical lymphadenopathy. Considering the limitations due to lack of immunocytochemical analysis of the thyroid and lymph node aspirates, our study should be taken as a preliminary one.",M2
19738362,"Evaluated reference intervals for serum free thyroxine and thyrotropin using the conventional outliner rejection test without regard to presence of thyroid antibodies and prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in Japanese subjects.The determination of the reference intervals for serum free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) is usually based on central 95 percentile intervals using subjects without detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) or thyroglobulin (Tg). However, some subjects with extreme data over reference intervals are generally included. The study objective was to evaluate the reference intervals for FT4 and TSH using different outlier tests. 1,007 Japanese subjects screened based on the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry criteria in the United States participated in this study. Serum FT4, TSH, and TPOand Tg antibodies were measured in all subjects. To make appropriate reference intervals, the Smirnov-Grubbus' outlier test was taken for antibody-free subjects (Ab[-] S-G), and the conventional outlier rejection method rejecting the value out of +/-3 standard deviation was taken for antibody-free subjects (Ab[-] STD) and all subjects (ALSTD), respectively. 12.8% of all subjects had either TPOor Tg antibodies in their serum. The 2.5(th) and 97.5(th) percentiles of reference intervals of serum FT4 (ng/dL) and TSH (mU/L) were 1.03~1.66 and 0.51 approximately 5.14 in (Ab[-] S-G), 1.03 approximately 1.65 and 0.51 approximately 4.57 in (Ab[-] STD) and 1.03 approximately 1.66 and 0.51 approximately 4.67 in (ALSTD), respectively. FT4 in males were significantly and negatively correlated with age, and TSH was significantly and positively correlated with age (P&lt;0.000001 and P&lt;0.00001, respectively). There was a significant difference between the sexes in FT4 (P&lt;0.00001) but not in TSH. The prevalence of hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, sublinical hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 0.2, 3.1, 2.3 and 0.3% (Ab[-] S-G), 0.3, 4.7, 2.3 and 0.3%(Ab[-] STD), and 0.3, 4.3, 2.3 and 0.3% (AL STD), respectively. This finding indicates that the conventional outlier rejection method is both convenient and appropriate to provide reference intervals for serum FT4 and TSH levels without regard to thyroid antibodies using large samples.",M2
19731774,"Persistence of goitre in children post-salt iodization in Islamic Republic of Iran: autoimmune status.We evaluated the prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in a random sample of 1188 schoolchildren aged 8-13 years with normalized iodine intake in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The prevalence of goitre was 39.6%; the majority had palpable but non-visible goitre. Of a subsample of 500 children, median urinary iodine excretion (18/8 microg/dL) indicated normal iodine intake. Thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibody was positive in 3.7% of children and was significantly correlated with the prevalence of goitre and hypothyroidism. No correlation was seen between urinary iodine excretion and positive TPO antibody, mean TPO antibody, hypothyroidism or prevalence of goitre. Autoimmune thyroiditis explains some cases of goitre but other goitrogenic factors need to be evaluated.",M2
19726232,"A role for autoantibodies in enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to a self-antigen, thyroid peroxidase.The role of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibodies (TPOAbs) in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease is unclear. We selected sera with a high concentration of TPOAbs from eleven patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), ten healthy monozygotic co-twins to HT patients, and twelve healthy individuals with no familiar disposition to AITD, and mixed each serum with normal mononuclear cells (MNCs). Following challenge with TPO, the MNCs' production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, correlated with the TPOAb content of the serum present in the culture (p=0.0002-0.05). Enrichment of foetal calf serum-containing media with IgG with a high content of TPOAbs enhanced the TPO-elicited production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma by normal MNCs in a dose- and Fcgamma-receptor dependent manner (p&lt;0.0002-0.05). The data indicate that TPO-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from phagocytic cells and T-cell responses to TPO are promoted by TPOAbs.",M2
19669106,"Thyroid peroxidase forms thionamide-sensitive homodimers: relevance for immunomodulation of thyroid autoimmunity.Thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) is the key enzyme in thyroid hormone production and a universal autoantigen in Graves' and other autoimmune thyroid diseases. We wished to explore the expression of TPO and whether it was affected by thionamide antithyroid drugs. We studied recombinant TPO, stably expressed by a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-TPO) and transiently expressed TPO-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and -FLAG fusion proteins. Immunoblotting of CHO-TPO cell extracts showed high-molecular weight (HMW) TPO isoforms that were resistant to reduction, as well as 110 kDa monomeric TPO. Co-immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) binding studies of FLAG- and eGFP-tagged TPO demonstrated TPO dimerisation. CHO-TPO cells cultured in methimazole (MMI) for 10 days showed a significant reduction in HMW-TPO isoforms at MMI concentrations of 1 microM and above (p &lt; 0.01), whereas monomeric TPO expression was unchanged. We observed a similar reduction in HMW-TPO in CHO-TPO cells cultured in propylthiouracil (10 microM and above). Binding of Graves' disease patient sera and TPO-Fabs to enzymatically active TPO that was captured onto solid phase was not abrogated by MMI. The cellular localisation of TPO in CHO-TPO cells was unchanged by MMI treatment. Our demonstration of homodimeric TPO and the reduction in HMW-TPO isoforms during thionamide treatment of CHO-TPO cells shows, for the first time, an effect of thionamides on TPO structure. This suggests a structural correlate to the effect of thionamides on TPO enzymatic activity and opens up a novel potential mechanism for thionamide immunomodulation of autoimmune thyroid disease.",M2
19657813,"Is an upper limit of 2.5 mUI/l for TSH appropriate for the first trimester of pregnancy among young <e>TPO</e> - women?OBJECTIVES: The general purpose of this study is to assess the distribution among the various hormonal indices in young pregnant women with negative thyroid peroxidase antibodies and iodine sufficiency and classify them accordingly while comparing them to literature proposed reference values for the first trimester. METHODS: A sectional study was carried out, including 127 pregnant women enrolled at the prenatal outpatient clinic at the Nova Iguaçu General Hospital, in the period comprised between 2000 and June 2007. They were submitted to TSH, free T(4), total T(4), TBG, and thyroid peroxidase antibody determinations. RESULTS: A median equal to 38.7 microg/ml was observed for TBG; TSH values varied between 0.02 and 5.84 mcUI/ml, with a median of 1.25 mcUI/ml. For total T(4) and free T(4), median values were, respectively 10.3 microg/dl and 1.20 ng/dl. Thirteen patients out of 115 displayed a TSH serum level above 2.5 mUI/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism classified by this new cutoff (serum TSH concentration between 2.5 mUI/l and the upper limit of the reference range), chiefly ATPO-negative young women display no need for treatment as there is no evidence that this condition is associated with maternal and fetal complications.",M2
19649385,"[Prevalence of anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-adrenal 21-hidroxylase in type 1 diabetes patients]There is still no consensus about the best strategy to screen Addison's disease (AD) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of anti-21-hydroxilase (anti-21OH) in a multiethnic T1DM population and investigate if its presence is associated with any adrenal dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity. METHODS: Forty individuals underwent an interview and blood was drawn for anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>), anti-21OH, TSH, free T4 and cortisol measurement. RESULTS: Anti-21OH was found in 7.5% (n = 3), none with adrenal dysfunction. This antibody was not exclusively seen in patients with anti-TPO (+). Anti-TPO was positive in 25% and associated with higher TSH levels (p = 0.034) and older age (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Although the frequency of anti-TPO in this sample was similar to previous studies, a higher prevalence of anti-21-OH was found. However, no coexisting adrenal dysfunction was detected, which does not support universal screening for AD in this group.",M2
19641516,"TSH receptor and thyroid-specific gene expression in human skin.Experimental evidence suggests that in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) the skin is a target of autoantibodies against thyroid-specific antigens; however, the role of these autoantibodies in skin alterations remains unclear. To gain insight into the function of nominally thyroid-specific genes in skin, we analyzed the expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone-receptor (TSH-R), thyroglobulin (Tg), sodium iodide symporter (NIS), and thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) genes in normal human skin biopsies and cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The results revealed the presence of all the transcripts in skin biopsies. However, in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, only TSH-R messenger RNA was always detected. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of skin specimens confirmed the presence of TSH-R protein in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Moreover, TSH treatment induced the proliferation of cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts and increased keratinocyte intracellular cAMP. Finally, affinity-purified IgGs from serum of patients affected by Graves' disease, but not by chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, stimulated cAMP accumulation in cultured keratinocytes, as well as their proliferation. In conclusion, the expression of thyroid-specific genes in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts and the mitogenic effects of TSH and IgGs on these cells support the concept that autoantibodies against thyroid-specific antigens may contribute to cutaneous symptoms in AITDs.",M2
19597722,"Selenoenzymes, laboratory parameters, and trace elements in different types of thyroid tumor.This study was performed to investigate selenoenzyme activities and trace element concentrations in thyroid tissues, with reference to other parameters routinely used to characterize thyroid function. This was to reveal relevant parameters as possible additional markers of tumor grade, clinical course, and prognosis of thyroid disorders. The tissue samples were obtained during surgical treatment (total or near total thyroidectomy) of 122 patients with different types of thyroid tumor. For most of the investigated parameters in different groups of patients, we did not find statistically significant differences. In the majority of cases, thyroid benign or malignant tumors were not accompanied by significant derangement of the gland selenoenzymes and of either intrathyroidal or plasma concentration of selenium. Nevertheless, types I and II iodothyronine deiodinases were the most promising (among selenoenzymes) targets for diagnoses and possibly therapy of thyroid tumors. Higher activities of both enzymes in cases with Graves' disease, as compared with other thyroid lesions, suggest their involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition. Patients with struna nodosa had higher levels of thyroid Zn, Cu, and Pb as compared with papillary carcinoma subjects and also a higher level of Cu than follicular carcinoma cases. The above diagnostics may play a similar role to some of the general thyroid function indices, TSH, anti-TG, anti-<e>TPO</e>, and calcitonin, which can partially distinguish between various thyroid tumors. In conclusion, some of selenium status markers, when accompanied with general parameters, and trace elements can serve as factors with pathophysiologic relevance and be helpful in the identification of malignant disease. Multivariate statistical methods should be employed to tackle a broad array of thyroid tumor diagnostic data in a short time. Partial least squares model and other pattern recognition methods seem to be the most appropriate methods for that task. The miniaturization of all the steps of complex analytical procedure should be developed in a way to allow its completion as sensitive, robust, and efficient for use of the small quantity of material provided by fine-needle biopsy.",M2
19554808,"Evolution of sonographic appearance of the thyroid gland in children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.BACKGROUND: Although thyroid ultrasound is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), classical sonographic findings are not always present. AIM: To calculate the time needed for children with HT and normal ultrasound at diagnosis to develop characteristic sonographic findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 105 children (23 male and 82 female) with HT (mean age 9.4 +/- 2.9 years) were studied. Physical examination and measurements of TSH and fT4 levels were performed at diagnosis, at 3-month intervals for the first year, and twice yearly thereafter. Thyroid ultrasound was performed at diagnosis and twice yearly thereafter. The median follow-up duration was 18 months (range: 6-61 months). RESULTS: The time needed for 30%, 50%, and 70% of children to demonstrate an abnormal thyroid sonographic pattern was 4, 7, and 14 months, respectively. Important factors accelerating sonographic changes were goiter (p = 0.023), hypothyroidism (p = 0.0255), and seropositivity for both thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) autoantibodies (p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Sonographic findings of HT are present in 37% of children at diagnosis. Fifty percent of children with normal initial thyroid US will develop changes within 7 months; however, characteristic findings may not develop for over 4 years.",M2
19549735,"Graves hyperthyroidism after stopping immunosuppressive therapy in type 1 diabetic Islet cell recipients with pretransplant <e>TPO</e> autoantibodies.OBJECTIVE: After an initially successful islet cell transplantation, a number of patients return to C-peptide negativity, and therefore immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued. Some are then found to have developed Graves disease. We examined the risk of Graves disease after immunosuppression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunosuppressive therapy was stopped in 13 type 1 diabetic islet cell recipients who had received one course of antithymocyte globulin and maintenance doses of mycophenolate mofetil and a calcineurin inhibitor. None had a history of thyroid disease. RESULTS: In four patients, clinical Graves hyperthyroidism was observed within 21 months after discontinuation and 30-71 months after the start of immunosuppressive therapy. All four patients exhibited a pretransplant positivity for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies, while the nine others were TPO negative pre- and posttransplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 diabetic recipients of islet cell grafts with pretransplant TPO autoantibody positivity exhibit a high risk for developing Graves hyperthyroidism after immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued for a failing graft.",M2
19494708,"The role of thyroid autoantibodies in the etiology of endemic goiter in schoolchildren of Isfahan, Iran.BACKGROUND: Eleven years after the initiation of universal salt iodization program in Iran, the prevalence of goiter is still high in some areas. AIM: To investigate the role of thyroid autoimmunity in the etiology of residual goiter in schoolchildren of Isfahan, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 2331 schoolchildren were selected by multi-stage random cluster sampling. Thyroid size was estimated in each child by inspection and palpation. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC), serum anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-<e>TPO</e> Ab), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (Anti-Tg Ab) were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 32.9% of children had goiter. The median UIC was 1955.5 microg/dl. There was significant difference in prevalence of positive anti-TPO Ab in goitrous (grade 2) and non-goitrous children (9.7 vs 3.7%, p= 0.02). Goitrous children had higher prevalence of positive anti-Tg Ab than non-goitrous ones (15.1 vs 3.1%, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the present study, goiter is still a public health problem in this region. This study suggests that thyroid autoimmunity is among the contributors of goiter persistence after elimination of iodine deficiency in Isfahan.",M2
19408849,"[Thyroid gland in the gravidity]OBJECTIVES: Disorders of the thyroid gland are the most common endocrinopathies in the gravidity. The spectrum of thyroid diseases in the pregnancy is not different from the diseases that affect the thyroid outside this period of life. However, clinical manifestations of thyreopaties can be modified by gravidity. Some thyreopaties are associated with gravidity or post partum period, or become manifest in this periods for the first time. The aim of this study was to assess thyroidal status of healthy pregnant women without history or clinical signs of thyreopathy. TYPE OF THE STUDY: One-time cross-sectional study. SETTING: 3rd internal clinic FNLP, Kosice. METHODS: We examined 76 pregnant women (mean age 34.46 +/- 5.34 years). The protocol included medical history, physical examination and assessment of TSH, fT4 and anti-<e>TPO</e> concentrations. RESULTS: The mean concentration of TSH was 2.78 +/- 1.25 mlU/ml. We found TSH concentration over 5.0 mlU/ml in 5 participants (6.58%), TSH levels in the borderline range between 4.0-5.0 mlU/ml had another 2 pregnants (2.63%). fT4 concentration was 15.02 +/- 3.61 pmol/l. The mean anti-TPO concentration was 43.28 +/- 15.75 IU/ml. 17 pregnant women (22%) had anti-TPO concentration over 25 IU/ml, which is the level that indicates autoimmune thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Thyreopathies are the most common endocrinopathies in the population and there is the evidence that almost one third of European population is affected from diseases of thyroid gland, predominantly women in fertile age. In the clinical praxis it is essential to think of thyroid disorders and in the case of need screening of the thyroid function.",M2
19408637,"Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.The aim of the study was to evaluate the natural course and potential risk factors of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and thyroid dysfunction, and their influences on growth and glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). The study comprised 148 subjects (age range 1-21 years; males 51%) with T1D. During the interval of 12 years serum levels of thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (anti-TG) autoantibodies, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and tyroksine (T4), were screened annually. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose and the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes, were recorded every 3 months. The mean follow-up was 7 +/- 4.1 years. Prevalence of AIT in subjects with T1D was 15.5%. It was significantly higher in girls (21.9% vs. 9.3%; p = 0.03). The mean age at AIT onset was 11.5 +/- 5.2 years. The mean interval between negative and positive AIT screening was 2.5 +/- 2.3 years. Cumulative incidence of AIT after 6 years of T1D duration was significantly higher in girls (30% vs. 15%; p = 0.03). Prevalence of hypothyroidism was 8.1% with no significant differences in sex distribution. Prevalence of hypothyroidism among subjects with elevated serum thyroid antibodies was 52.2% with significant male preponderance (85.7% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.005). There were no subjects who developed hypothyroidism in absence of thyroid antibodies. Cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism after 3 years from the moment of thyroid antibodies appearance was 55% with significant male preponderance (85% vs. 40%; p = 0.005). The mean interval between T1D onset and hypothyroidism development was 3.3 +/- 2.5 years, and between thyroid antibodies appearance and hypothyreoidism development was 1.7 +/- 1.2 years. The mean age at hypothyroidism onset was 12.7 +/- 5.3 years. There were no differences in growth and metabolic control between patients with and without AIT. The results of the present study confirmed frequent occurrence of AIT and thyroid dysfunction in subjects with T1D. The number of newly diagnosed subjects with AIT reached the peak at the age of puberty. Girls were significantly more predisposed to AIT at any age while amongst subjects with elevated thyroid antibodies boys developed hypothyroidism more frequently. Annual screening of thyroid antibodies in all patients with T1D is recommended, while serum TSH level should be measured in patients with detected thyroid antibodies.",M2
19348579,"Thyroid antigens, not central tolerance, control responses to immunization in BALB/c versus C57BL/6 mice.BACKGROUND: Vaccination with cDNA for the human thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) in a plasmid, without adjuvant, induces TSHR antibodies in C57BL/6 but rarely in BALB/c mice. This outcome could be due to a difference between  high  versus  low  antibody responder mouse strains. However, unlike their poor response to TSHR-DNA vaccination, BALB/c mice vaccinated with thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>)-cDNA readily develop antibodies to TPO. We hypothesized that insight into these conundrums would be provided by the following differences in central tolerance: (i) between two mouse strains (C57BL/6 versus BALB/c) for the TSHR; and (ii) between two thyroid autoantigens (TPO and the TSHR) in one mouse strain (BALB/c). METHODS: We studied autoantigen expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction to quantify mRNA transcripts for the TSHR, TPO, and thyroglobulin (Tg) in thymic tissue (as well as in thyroid) of young mice. RESULTS: Our hypothesis was not confirmed. Intrathymic TSHR transcript expression was similar in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, thymic mRNA transcripts for TSHR and TPO were comparable. Unlike the 10-fold differences for the autoantigens in thyroid tissue (Tg greater than TPO which, in turn was greater than the TSHR), intrathymic transcripts for TPO and the TSHR were similar, both being slightly lower than the level for Tg. CONCLUSIONS: Central tolerance, assessed by measuring intrathymic transcripts of thyroid autoantigens, does not explain the different outcome of TSHR-DNA vaccination in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, or even susceptibility versus resistance to hyperthyroidism induced by TSHR-adenovirus. Instead, differences in MHC and TSHR T-cell epitopes likely contribute to TSHR antibody development (or not) following DNA plasmid immunization. The greater immunogenicity of TPO versus TSHR probably relates to the greater number of nonhomologous amino acids in the human and mouse TPO ectodomains (78 amino acids) than in the human and mouse TSHR ectodomains (58 amino acids). Overall, the autoantigens themselves, not central tolerance, control DNA plasmid-induced immunity to TPO and the TSHR.",M2
19298606,"Increased prevalence of autoimmunity in Turner syndrome--influence of age.Individuals with Turner syndrome (TS) are prone to develop autoimmune conditions such as coeliac disease (CD), thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The objective of the present study was to examine TS of various karyotypes for autoantibodies and corresponding diseases. This was investigated in a prospective cross-sectional study of Danish TS patients (n = 107, median age 36.7 years, range: 6-60 years). A medical history was recorded and a blood sample was analysed for autoantibodies against gliadin, transglutaminase, adrenal cortex, intrinsic factor, anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and glutamic-acid-decarboxylase 65 (GAD-65). Autoantibodies were present in 58% (n = 61) of all patients, whereof 18% (11) had autoantibodies targeting more than one organ. Patients with autoantibodies were significantly older than those without (P = 0.001). Anti-TPO was present in 45% (48) of patients, of whom 33% (16) were hypothyroid. Overall, 18% (19) presented with CD autoantibodies, of whom 26% (five) had CD. Anti-TPO and CD autoantibodies co-existed in 9% (10). Immunoglobulin A deficiency was found in 3% (three) of patients, who all had CD autoantibodies without disease. Among four patients with anti-GAD-65 none had T1DM, but two were classified as having T2DM. One patient had adrenocortical autoantibodies but not adrenal failure. Autoantibodies against intrinsic factor were absent. Anti-GAD-65 was increased in isochromosomal karyotypes (3/23 versus 1/84, P = 0.008) with no other association found between autoantibodies and karyotype. In conclusion, TS girls and women face a high prevalence of autoimmunity and associated disease with a preponderance towards hypothyroidism and CD. Thus, health care providers dealing with this patient group should be observant and test liberally for these conditions even before clinical symptoms emerge.",M2
19243353,"Two novel mutations in the human thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) gene: genetics and clinical findings in four children.We report four children originating from two unrelated German families with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to mutations in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene. Three female siblings (family 1) were found to be compound heterozygous for two mutations, a known mutation in exon 9 (W527C), and a mutation in exon 8 (Q446H), which has not been described before. In the second family we identified a boy with goitrous CH, who had a novel homozygous mutation in the TPO gene in exon 16 (W873X). All children of family 1 were diagnosed postnatally by newborn screening. The case of the boy of family 2 has already been reported for the in utero treatment of a goiter with hypothyroidism.

19228824,"Reference intervals in evaluation of maternal thyroid function during the first trimester of pregnancy.BACKGROUND: Insufficient function of the thyroid gland can cause low concentrations of thyroid gland hormones which are necessary for the proper development of the foetus brain, especially during the beginning of pregnancy. We determined the reference interval for TSH in the first trimester of pregnancy and the decision point for anti-<e>TPO</e> antibodies' positivity. METHODS: We tested 5520 women from the central part of the Czech Republic during the first trimester of pregnancy for serum TSH, anti-TPO and FT4 by chemiluminometric immunoanalysis on an ADVIA Centaur system (Siemens). The reference interval for TSH during the first trimester of pregnancy was determined using the log transformation, and then summarized as the geometrical mean (95% CI); following which, a suitable decision point for anti-TPO positivity was set. RESULTS: The reference interval for TSH was determined to be 0.06-3.67 mU/l. The suppression of TSH was found in 2.93% of the women; a raised concentration of TSH had been found in 4.48% of the women. For anti-TPO, the cut-off was established at 143 kU/l; 11.2% of the pregnant women were found to be anti-TPO positive. CONCLUSION: Determination of the reference interval for TSH during early pregnancy is one of the basic requirements when implementing a general examination of the thyroid gland at the beginning of pregnancy. The decision level for positivity of anti-TPO is more than double the manufacturer's reference interval.",M2
19208852,"Tissue-specific deiodinase regulation during food restriction and low replacement dose of leptin in rats.The relationship between thyroid function and leptin has been extensively studied; however, the mechanisms underlying the changes in thyroid hormone economy that occur during caloric deprivation remain elusive. Our goal was to evaluate the thyroid function of rats submitted to 40% food restriction after chronic leptin replacement. Caloric restriction for 25 days led to significantly reduced serum leptin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T(4)), and triiodothyronine (T(3)) and increased serum corticosterone, while liver, kidney, and thyroid type I deiodinase (D1) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) type II deiodinase (D2) activities were decreased and hypothalamic D2 was significantly increased. Interestingly, thyroid iodide uptake was unchanged by caloric restriction, but thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) activity was significantly reduced. Leptin replacement for the last 10 days of caloric restriction normalized serum leptin and TSH levels, but serum T(4) and T(3) levels and thyroid D1 and TPO activities were not reestablished. Also, a negative effect of leptin administration on Na(+)-I(-) symporter function was detected. Liver and kidney D1 and hypothalamic and BAT D2 were normalized by leptin, while pituitary D2 was significantly decreased. In conclusion, a tissue-specific modulation of deiodinases might be implicated in the normalization of thyroid function during leptin replacement in food-restricted rats. Although leptin restores the hypothalamus-pituitary axis during food restriction, it exerts a direct negative effect on the thyroid gland; thus normalization of serum thyroid hormones might depend on changes in deiodinase activities and the long-term thyroid stimulation by TSH to counterbalance the direct negative effects of leptin on the thyroid gland.",M2
19194833,"The prevalence of iodine deficiency, serum thyroglobulin, anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels in the urban areas of Kayseri, Central Anatolia.BACKGROUND: The prevalence of goitre and urinary iodine excretion (UIE) indicate endemic iodine deficiency (ID) in a population. Previous studies have shown that Kayseri is one of the most iodine-deficient areas in Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of goitre, evaluate the degree of ID, its effects on thyroid functions and volume of subjects living in wide outer skirts of the old volcano Erciyes, at 1655 m and 1350 m altitudes. METHODS: UIE was determined in 209 school-age children (SAC) aged between 10 and 14 years and in 183 adults. Thyroid volume (TV) of subjects was performed used by both palpation and ultrasonography (USG). In addition, serum free tri-iodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg and anti thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibody levels were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of goitre according to palpation and USG among SAC was found as 50.7 and 58.4% respectively, as 65.0 and 57.9% among adults. Although mean UIC of whole subjects was 30+/-34 microg/l indicated moderate iodine (I) deficiency, 55.4% of the subjects' UIE was &lt;20 microg/l. While the serum fT3, TSH, anti-TPO, Tg levels, body mass index (BMI), TV of SAC and adults (except BMI) with goitre were higher than those of without goitre, serum fT4 and UIE were lower than those of without goitre. CONCLUSIONS: The population living in two areas was exposed to consequences of severe and moderate ID and also endemic goitre due to geographical characteristics of the area. A plan of action including sufficient I intake of people should be planned and be implemented effectively.",M2
19189706,"Congenital hypothyroidism caused by a novel homozygous mutation in the thyroid peroxidase gene.Congenital primary hypothyroidism occurs in one out of 4,000 births. About 20% of cases are due to defects in thyroid hormonogenesis. We report on a German girl with congenital hypothyroidism due to a mutation in the thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) gene who had elevated serum levels of thyroglobulin during periods of hyperthyrotropinemia. METHODS: The TPO gene was sequenced directly from genomic DNA. RESULTS: The patient had a novel homozygous mutation (R314W) in the TPO gene. The unaffected parents were non-consanguineous and both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Fifty normal individuals did not harbor the mutation ruling out a common polymorphism. CONCLUSION: The identified TPO gene mutation (R314W) is very likely the genetic cause for hypothyroidism in the reported child. R314W has not been described before and codes for a presumably inactive TPO molecule.",M2
19141579,"Discontinuation of smoking increases the risk for developing thyroid peroxidase antibodies and/or thyroglobulin antibodies: a prospective study.CONTEXT: Autoimmune thyroid disease develops in genetic susceptible subjects, provoked by environmental factors. Little is known of the environment in the early stages of autoimmunity. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated environmental factors contributing to de novo occurrence of thyroid antibodies. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 521 euthyroid women without thyroid antibodies in serum who were relatives of autoimmune thyroid disease patients. Follow-up was 5 yr. Baseline characteristics were related to the occurrence of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and/or thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies. Exposure to environmental factors in the year prior to the occurrence of antibodies was investigated in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: The 5-yr probability for conversion to TPO antibodies (TPO-Ab) and/or Tg antibodies (Tg-Ab) was 20.1%, and for TPO-Ab alone the probability was 14.5%. None of the baseline characteristics except TSH contributed to the risk of seroconversion. Each case (occurrence of antibodies) was matched for age and duration of follow-up with two controls (no seroconversion). Exposure to environmental stimuli was similar between cases and controls except for smoking. At study entrance, current smokers among cases and controls were 31.3 and 35.5%, respectively (nonsignificant). Current smoking decreased in cases during follow-up. Consequently, the odds ratios (OR) of smoking for developing TPO-Ab and/or Tg-Ab were 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-1.04] 1 yr before seroconversion and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.35-0.99) at seroconversion; for conversion to TPO-Ab, these figures are 0.58 (95% CI, 0.31-1.09) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.29-1.02), respectively. CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of smoking is associated with an increased risk for occurrence of TPO-Ab and/or Tg-Ab in serum. The observation is in line with the decreased risk of hypothyroidism in smokers.",M2
19106271,"Perinatal outcome of children born to mothers with thyroid dysfunction or antibodies: a prospective population-based cohort study.CONTEXT: There are only a few large prospective studies involving evaluation of the effect of maternal thyroid dysfunction on offspring and observations are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of thyroid dysfunction or antibody positivity on perinatal outcome. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included prospective population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 including 9247 singleton pregnancies. First-trimester maternal serum samples were analyzed for thyroid hormones [TSH, free T(4) (fT4)] and antibodies [thyroid-peroxidase antibody (<e>TPO</e>-Ab) and thyroglobulin antibody (TG-Ab)]. Mothers were classified by their hormone and antibody status into percentile categories based on laboratory data and compared accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES: Outcomes were perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, absolute and gestational age-adjusted birth weight, and absolute and relative placental weight. RESULTS: The offspring of TPO-Ab- and TG-Ab-positive mothers had higher perinatal mortality, which was not affected by thyroid hormone status. Unadjusted and adjusted (for maternal age and parity) risk for increased perinatal mortality was an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval 1.4-7.1) and 3.2 (1.4-7.1) in TPO-Ab- and 2.6 (1.1-6.2) and 2.5 (1.1-5.9) in TG-Ab-positive mothers. TPO-Ab-positive mothers had more large-for-gestational age infants (2.4 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.017), as did mothers with low TSH and high fT4 concentrations vs. reference group (6.6 vs. 2.5%, P = 0.045). Significantly higher placental weights were observed among mothers with low TSH and high fT4 or high TSH and low fT4 levels as well as among TPO-Ab-positive mothers. CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester antibody positivity is a risk factor for perinatal death but not thyroid hormone status as such. Thyroid dysfunction early in pregnancy seems to affect fetal and placental growth.",M2
19092289,"Prevalence of interrelated autoantibodies in thyroid diseases and autoimmune disorders.OBJECTIVE: We determined the autoantibody profile in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) and examined the distribution of thyroid-related autoantibodies in other autoimmune disorders. METHODS: We tested sera from 234 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 130 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), 249 with other autoimmune diseases, and 50 healthy controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Autoantibodies except TSH receptor antibody (Ab), anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) Ab and anti-thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) Ab were not significantly prevalent in patients with AITD despite a significantly high elevation of thyroid-related Ab. Significant prevalence of autoantibodies related to AITD was observed in type 1 diabetes patients. Elevation of anti-Tg Ab was seen in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and anti-TPO Ab was elevated in patients with PBC. Although the prevalence of anti-acetylcholine receptor Ab and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)- related Ab was significant in AIH, primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS)-related Ab were also found in both liver diseases. In myasthenia gravis (MG) patients, thyroid-related Ab and pSS-related Ab were detected in both MG groups, although SLE-related Ab were limited to the anti-muscle specific kinase Ab-positive MG patients. In patients with connective tissue diseases, anti- Tg Ab and anti-TPO Ab were significantly prevalent. CONCLUSION: Thyroid-related Ab were significantly elevated in all autoimmune diseases. Conversely, the elevations of Ab were not significant in the patients with AITD, suggesting a close relationship between AITD and other immune-mediated diseases.",M2
19092255,"To treat or not to treat euthyroid autoimmune disorder during pregnancy?BACKGROUND: Subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and has a deleterious effect on fetal development. The aim of this study was to evaluate a screening and treatment strategy of subclinical hypothyroidism, and to establish normal ranges of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T(4)) during pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on 784 consecutive files of pregnant women; the files were systematically searched for thyroid function and antithyroid antibodies in order to determine the effect and the prevalence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (<e>TPO</e>-Ab) during pregnancy, and to evaluate treatment with levothyroxin (LT(4)) in TPO-Ab carriers. RESULTS: Among the 75 TPO-Ab-positive patients, 42 received LT(4) treatment during pregnancy. Although the range of TSH serum levels was wide, the mean TSH level was significantly higher in TPO-Ab-positive women (3 vs. 1 mIU/l, p &lt; 0.01). No significant difference in the obstetrical complications rate was observed between TPO-Ab-positive and TPO-Ab-negative populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides information on normal ranges of serum TSH and free T(4) for Belgian pregnant women receiving iodide supplementation. Based on our results, we suggest supplementation of TPO-Ab-positive pregnant women with 50 microg/day of LT(4), unless their TSH levels are lower than 1 mIU/l, to avoid the risk of hypothyroidism during pregnancy.",M2
19066738,"Characterization of cultured thymus tissue used for transplantation with emphasis on promiscuous expression of thyroid tissue-specific genes.Autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in some complete DiGeorge anomaly patients after thymus transplantation. This study was designed to assess the effect of culture of thymus tissue on the expression of genes involved in the development of autoimmunity. The expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>), and cytokeratin RNAs was examined in thymocytes and thymus tissue on the day of thymus harvest and after 14 and 21 days of culture. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the cytokeratin expression in the thymus tissue. AIRE, TG, TPO, and cytokeratin mRNAs were found in harvest-day, 14-day and 21-day cultured tissues. Levels of AIRE, TG, and cytokeratin mRNAs were mostly higher after culture compared to expression on the harvest day, likely secondary to thymocyte depletion.",M2
19045937,"Effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate on rat thyroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism.The potential toxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an environmentally persistent organic pollutant, is of great concern. The present study examines the ability of PFOS to disturb thyroid function and the possible mechanisms involved in PFOS-induced thyroid hormone alteration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1.7, 5.0, and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS in drinking water for 91 consecutive days. Serum was collected for analysis of total and free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotrophin (TSH). Thyroid and liver were removed for the measurement of endpoints closely related to thyroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism following PFOS exposure. Determined endpoints were the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for two isoforms of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGT1A6 and UGT1A1) and type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) in liver, sodium iodide symporter (NIS), TSH receptor (TSHR), and DIO1 in thyroid as well as the activity of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>). Serum total T4 level decreased significantly at all applied dosages, whereas total T3 level increased markedly only at 1.7 mg/L of PFOS. No statistically significant toxic effects of PFOS on serum TSH were observed. Hepatic UGTIA1, but not UGT1A6, mRNA was up-regulated at 5.0 and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS. Treatment with PFOS lowered hepatic DIO1 mRNA at 15.0 mg/L but increased thyroidal DIO1 mRNA dose dependently. The activity of TPO, NIS, and TSHR mRNA in thyroid were unaffected by PFOS treatment. These results indicate that increased hepatic T4 glucuronidation via UGT1A1 and increased thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 via DIO1 were responsible in part for PFOS-induced hypothyroxinemia in rats.",M2
19014325,"Tissue transglutaminase antibodies in individuals with celiac disease bind to thyroid follicles and extracellular matrix and may contribute to thyroid dysfunction.BACKGROUND: Individuals with active celiac disease (CD+) have an increased incidence of thyroid dysfunction, which improves on a gluten-free diet (CD-). We investigated whether tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA antibodies (anti-TGase II) present in sera of patients with celiac disease react with thyroid tissue and possibly contribute to thyroid disease. METHODS: Serum from 40 active celiac patients taken before a gluten-free diet (CD+), 46 patients on a gluten-free diet (CD-), 40 normal controls (NC), and 25 with Crohn's disease (CROHN) was used. All sera were screened for antithyroperoxidase antibodies (<e>TPO</e>-AB) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-AB), and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was performed on primate thyroid tissue sections using TPO-AB- and TG-AB-negative sera. RESULTS: IIF with thyroid seronegative, anti-TGase II-positive CD+ sera (n = 23) demonstrated staining of thyroid follicular cells and extracellular matrix, in an identical pattern with monoclonal anti-human TGase II antibody. Evidence of TGase II as the antigen in thyroid tissue was supported by elimination of the IIF pattern when sera were depleted of anti-TGase II by pretreatment with human recombinant TGase II. No staining of thyroid tissue was observed when sera from CD+ patients that were negative for TGase II antibodies, or sera from NC subjects were used. Thyroid antibodies were found in 43% of CD+ patients, significantly higher than NC and CROHN patients (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, a positive correlation was observed between anti-TGase II and TPO-AB titers (p = 0.0001; r = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TGase II antibodies bind to TGase II in thyroid tissue, and titers correlate with TPO antibody titers. These findings suggest that anti-TGase II antibodies could contribute to the development of thyroid disease in celiac disease.",M2
18972269,"Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes: impact on thyroid function, metabolic control and pregnancy outcome.OBJECTIVE: In pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, we evaluated whether the presence of thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (anti-<e>TPO</e>) was associated with changes in thyroid function, metabolic control and pregnancy outcome. DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective study, Denmark. POPULATION: Ninety-six consecutive pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Twenty-five healthy pregnant controls. METHODS: At 8, 14, 21, 27 and 33 weeks, the diabetic women self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) (8/day) for 3 days and had blood samplings obtained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxin (T4), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), anti-TPO, pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: Anti-TPO was detected in 31 (32%) of the pregnant diabetic women compared with two women (8%) in the healthy controls (p=0.015). The presence of anti-TPO was associated with higher TSH at 8 (p&lt;0.0001) and 14 weeks (p&lt;0.05) and lower free T4 at 8 weeks (p&lt;0.05) compared with anti-TPO negative women. Twenty untreated anti-TPO positive women had higher TSH compared with untreated, anti-TPO negative women (p&lt;0.05), but comparable free T4. At inclusion, 25% had TSH above the recommended treatment goal for levothyroxine (TSH&gt;2.5 mIU/l), most prevalently among anti-TPO positive women. Sixteen women (17%) were treated for thyroid disorder during pregnancy. No differences were detected between the diabetic women with and without anti-TPO regarding HbA1C, insulin dose, median SMPG or pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TPO was present in one-third of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and associated with slightly higher TSH, but not poorer glycemic control or adverse birth outcome. A total of 17% of women with type 1 diabetes were treated for thyroid disorder during pregnancy.",M2
18927530,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome patient: casual association or related diseases?Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. MRS is classically defined as a triad of recurrent orofacial edema, relapsing paralysis of the facial nerve, and fissured tongue. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old woman with orofacial swelling and facial pain attacks. The patient reported to suffer of hypothyroidism and laboratory findings disclosed free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyrotropin (TSH) altered. Endocrinological consult led to the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Antithyroper-oxidase antibodies (anti-<e>TPO</e>) were highly elevated and thyroid function tests had evidenced a clinically significant hypothyroidism. A link between MRS and immunological disorders such as sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, unilateral anterior uveitis and multiple sclerosis was documented. The literature did not report any association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The presence of the anti-TPO antibodies in the case reported here could suggest a possible correlation between immunological alteration characteristic of autoimmune thyroiditis and MRS.",M2
18852925,"Thyroid sonomorphology, thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid function: new epidemiological data in unselected German employees.AIM: Employees of Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH underwent thyroid screening in 2006 to assess new data about the prevalence of irregular sonomorphological pattern, elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (<e>TPO</e> AB) and thyroid function in an unselected adult German population. PARTICIPANTS, METHODS: The examination included 700 unselected employees. Blood samples were analyzed for serum TSH and TPO AB, and ultrasound of the thyroid was performed. RESULTS: In 40.7% of the participants (n = 285) an irregular sonomorphological pattern was detected: goiter in 13.7%, nodules in 35.6%, nodular goiter in 8.6% and a hypoechogenic pattern of the thyroid gland in 20.4%. Serum TSH was increased in 3.9% and decreased in 0.6%. Elevated TPO AB values were observed in 13%. Only 1.4% (n = 10) showed elevated TPO AB combined with a TSH increase. Sonomorphological abnormalities were associated with increased TPO AB in 7.1%. Elevated TPO AB was observed significantly more often in combination with sonomorphological pathology (54.9%) than without (45.1%) (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Sonomorphological disorders are still very common in Germany and our results are comparable with previous screening examinations. Elevated TPO AB correlated significantly with the sonomorphological pattern of nodules and goiter. This may reflect an improved iodine supply or a hypertrophic stage of autoimmune thyroiditis in some cases.",M2
18774556,"Increased fetal abortion rate in autoimmune thyroid disease is related to circulating <e>TPO</e> autoantibodies in an autoimmune thyroiditis animal model.OBJECTIVE: To determine the fertility and abortion rates in a mouse model of autoimmune thyroiditis and its relationship with circulating anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody. DESIGN: Experimental animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): C57bl/6 mice. INTERVENTION(S): Female C57bl/6 mice immunized with recombinant mouse TPO (rmTPO) in complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) or glutathione-S-transferase (GST-CFA) were allowed to mate. The pregnant mice were killed on day 14 of pregnancy for assessment of fetal development. The effects of TPO antibody on preimplantation embryo development and implantation rate were also studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Litter size, resorption rate, preimplantation embryo development, and implantation rate. RESULT(S): All of the mice immunized with rmTPO-CFA possessed anti-TPO antibody. They had reduced litter size and increased incidence of resorbed fetus compared with the control. Higher serum TSH levels, but not T(4) levels, were demonstrated after rmTPO-CFA immunization. Anti-TPO antibody bound to preimplantation embryos. Treatment of the embryos with the antibody marginally decreased the formation of 3/4-cell embryos but had no effect on the subsequent development and implantation compared with the nonimmune control sera. CONCLUSION(S): Autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with reduced fertility and higher incidence of fetal loss. The anti-TPO antibody may affect post-implantation embryo development, leading to fetal loss.",M2
18710471,"Expression of iodine metabolism genes in human thyroid tissues: evidence for age and BRAFV600E mutation dependency.CONTEXT: Children present a higher susceptibility to developing thyroid cancer after radioiodine exposure and also a higher frequency of functional metastases than adults. OBJECTIVE: To assess the mRNA expression of the sodium/iodide (Na(+)/I(-)) symporter (NIS), the Pendred syndrome gene (PDS), thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>), thyroglobulin (Tg) and TSH receptor (TSH-R) in normal thyroid tissues (NTTs) and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) among different age groups. METHODS: Analysis included 59 samples: 21 NTTs and 38 PTCs, of which 21 were the classic type (CPTC) and 17 the follicular variant (FVPTC). Patients were divided into three age groups: I (n = 16) 5-21 years, II (n = 13) 22-59 years, and III (n = 10) 60-91 years. The relative mRNA expression of the five target genes was determinate by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). RESULTS: Expression of all genes was significantly higher in NTTs than in PTCs, and it was not age dependent in the NTT group. Among PTCs, the mean expression of PDS, TPO and TSH-R was significantly lower in group II than in group I. PDS, TPO and Tg expression was significantly lower in classic PTCs than in FVPTCs. The difference was related to a higher frequency of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the former group. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of higher PDS, TPO and TSH-R mRNA expression in paediatric vs. adult primary tumour tissues supports the hypothesis that this might contribute to the increased functional activity of metastases in the paediatric group. The finding that mRNA expression of the target genes in NTT was not age dependent does not provide an explanation for the higher susceptibility in the paediatric group.",M2
18695079,"Prediction of progression to overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in female relatives of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease using the Thyroid Events Amsterdam (THEA) score.BACKGROUND: Genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Family members of patients with AITD are at increased risk for AITD, but not all will develop overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Our goal was to develop a simple predictive score that has broad applicability and is easily calculated at presentation for progression to overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism within 5 years in female relatives of patients with AITD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 790 healthy first- or second-degree female relatives of patients with documented Graves or Hashimoto disease in The Netherlands. Baseline assessment included measurement of serum thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibody levels as well as evaluation for the presence and levels of Yersinia enterocolitica antibodies. We also gathered data on family background, smoking habits, use of estrogen medication, pregnancy, and exposure to high levels of iodine. In follow-up, thyroid function was investigated annually for 5 years. As main outcome measures, termed events, we looked for overt hypothyroidism (TSH levels &gt;5.7 mIU/L and FT(4) levels &lt;0.72 ng/dL) or overt hyperthyroidism (TSH levels &lt;0.4 mIU/L and FT(4) levels &gt;1.56 ng/dL). RESULTS: The cumulative event rate was 7.5% over 5 years. The mean annual event rate was 1.5%. There were 38 hypothyroid and 13 hyperthyroid events. Independent risk factors for events were baseline findings for TSH and TPO antibodies in a level-dependent relationship (for TSH the risk already starts to increase at values &gt;2.0 mIU/L) and family background (with the greatest risk attached to subjects having 2 relatives with Hashimoto disease). A numerical score, the Thyroid Events Amsterdam (THEA) score, was designed to predict events by weighting these 3 risk factors proportionately to their relative risks (maximum score, 21): low (0-7), medium (8-10), high (11-15), and very high (16-21). These THEA scores were associated with observed event rates of 2.7%, 14.6%, 27.1%, and 76.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate simple predictive score was developed to estimate the 5-year risk of overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in female relatives of patients with AITD. However, in view of the small number of observed events, independent validation of the THEA score is called for.",M2
18685814,"The minimal arsenic concentration required to inhibit the activity of thyroid peroxidase activity in vitro.Arsenical compounds are known to interfere with normal thyroid function. Therefore, we designed an experiment to determine the minimal concentration of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) required to inhibit thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) activity in vitro. The activity of commercially prepared human TPO was assayed spectrophotometrically in the absence (control) or presence of arsenic (0.1, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 ppm) during a 10-min incubation period. The results of this study indicate a significant dose-response relationship with the highest concentration of arsenic producing the greatest amount of TPO inhibition. Compared to controls, 0.1 ppm arsenic had no effect on TPO activity. Incubation for 2 min in the presence of 1.0, 5.0, or 10 ppm arsenic inhibited TPO activity to 4%, 9%, and 9% of control, respectively. After 10 min incubation in the presence of 1.0 or 5.0 ppm arsenic, TPO activity returned to 92% and 54% of control, respectively, while the presence of 10 ppm arsenic further inhibited TPO activity to 1% of control. In summary, arsenic trioxide inhibits in vitro TPO activity in a dose-dependent manner, and the minimal dose required to inhibit this activity is between 0.1 and 1 ppm.",M2
18631006,"Factors influencing the study of peroxidase-generated iodine species and implications for thyroglobulin synthesis.A key issue in the mechanism of thyroglobulin (Tg) iodination by thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) is whether a TPO-bound iodine intermediate directly iodinates Tg-incorporated tyrosines (specific iodination) or whether reactive iodine species released from TPO effectuate Tg iodination (nonspecific iodination). We addressed these alternatives by (a) determining the aqueous equilibria of the iodine species potentially involved in the kinetic studies of TPO-mediated iodination, and (b) reviewing the structure of the substrate channel in mammalian peroxidases. Redox-potentiometric analysis of aqueous iodine combined with integrated mathematical modelling demonstrates that I2 reacts with water to form several iodine species including hypoiodious acid (HOI). The HOI/I2 ratio depends on time, iodide concentration, buffering agents, and pH varying dramatically from pH 4 to 7.4. These factors may confound the use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to determine the mechanism of TPO-catalyzed iodination since both I2 and HOI iodinate tyrosine but with different specificities and reaction rates. Consequently there is as yet no conclusive kinetic evidence that iodination occurs via formation of a TPO-bound iodinated intermediate. Furthermore, knowledge of TPO structure, gained from X-ray crystallographic studies indicates that access of Tg-bound tyrosyl groups to the active site of TPO is not possible. Thus the emerging conclusion is that the mechanism of Tg iodination is nonspecific. This is consistent with the occurrence of thyroid hormone formation in prevertebrate ascidians which exhibit TPO-like activity but lack the Tg gene.",M2
18631004,"Long-term follow-up of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) treated with levothyroxine.BACKGROUND: A number of studies show that the serum levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (<e>TPO</e>-Ab) in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis decline during levothyroxine treatment, but do not provide quantitative data or report the fraction of patients in whom test for TPO-Ab became negative ( normalization percentage ). The objective of the present study was to provide this information. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of TPO-Ab concentrations in 36 women and 2 men (mean age 51 +/- 16 years; range 19-81 years) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis as defined by the following criteria: elevated plasma TPO-Ab and typical hypoechogenicity of the thyroid in high-resolution sonography at first presentation or during follow-up and low pertechnetate uptake in thyroid scintigraphy. When first studied 17 women and 1 man were not yet taking levothyroxine. The remaining 20 patients were receiving levothyroxine. At initial examination 18 patients had serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations above normal. Results of up to eight (mean = 5.8) measurements obtained over a mean period of 50 months while patients were receiving levothyroxine were analyzed. In addition, serum TSH, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) were measured, and ultrasound of the neck was performed at each follow-up examination. RESULTS: In terms of TPO-Ab levels, 35 of 38 patients (92%) had a decrease, 2 patients had undulating levels, and 1 patient had an inverse hyperbolic increase in her TPO-Ab levels. In the 35 patients in whom there were decreasing TPO-Ab values, the mean of the first value was 4779 IU/mL with an SD of 4099 IU/mL. The mean decrease after 3 months was 8%, and after 1 year it was 45%. Five years after the first value, TPO-Ab levels were 1456 +/- 1219 IU/mL, a decrease of 70%. TPO-Ab levels became negative, &lt; 100 IU/mL, in only six patients, a normalization percentage of 16%. There were no correlations between changes in thyroid volume and changes in TPO-Ab. CONCLUSION: Serum TPO-Ab levels decline in most patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who are taking levothyroxine, but after a mean of 50 months, TPO-Ab became negative in only a minority of patients.",M2
18631003,"Thyroid autoimmunity in schoolchildren in an area with long-standing iodine sufficiency: correlation with gender, pubertal stage, and maternal thyroid autoimmunity.BACKGROUND: A strong genetic background and gender are believed to be involved in thyroid autoimmunity (TA). The age these factors become manifest is less clear, however. The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of TA in children and adolescents and to determine if there are relationships between the period of onset of TA and gender and between TA and maternal autoimmunity. METHODS: Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-<e>TPO</e> Ab), antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg Ab), thyrotropin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and urinary iodine were determined in 440 healthy schoolchildren (200 boys and 240 girls), aged 5-18 years, and in 123 mothers living in an iodine-replete region. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive anti-TPO and anti-Tg Ab was 4.6% and 4.3%, respectively. In girls, the prevalence of positive anti-TPO Ab was higher in Tanner stage II-V compared to Tanner stage I (8.2% vs. 2.2%; p &lt; 0.05). No difference was detected with regard to anti-Tg Ab. In girls, positive anti-TPO and anti-Tg Ab levels were associated with significantly greater thyroid volume. Hypoechogenicity was detected in 52.6% and 36.8% of the children with positive anti-TPO or anti-Tg Ab, respectively (p = 0.0005). The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, as defined by positive serum anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg and an echographic pattern of the thyroid gland having diffuse or irregular hypoechogenicity, was 2.5%. Mothers of anti-TPO Ab positive children had positive anti-TPO Ab more frequently compared to mothers of anti-TPO Ab negative children (82% vs. 18%; p = 0.0005). Mothers of anti-Tg Ab positive children had positive anti-Tg Ab more frequently compared to mothers of anti-Tg Ab negative children (75% vs. 25%; p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that thyroid antibody positivity in children was significantly associated with maternal autoimmunity and their development in girls emerges at puberty. Since heredity, female gender, and puberty are strongly associated with TA, girls in families with TA should be examined at the onset of puberty.",M2
18616703,"Detection of enterovirus RNA in postoperative thyroid tissue specimens.CONTEXT: Autoimmune thyroiditis is a very common disease. A genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as viruses are thought to contribute to the development of autoimmune thyroiditis. Enteroviruses, which are involved in other autoimmune diseases, are attractive candidates. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of enteroviral genome sequences in postoperative thyroid tissues with lymphocytic infiltration, a common histological feature of thyroiditis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Postoperative thyroid specimens collected prospectively from 86 patients were blindly frozen at -80 degrees C. The presence of EV genome sequences in the samples was blindly investigated by real-time RT-PCR. Clinical data, histological findings and levels of anti-<e>TPO</e> antibodies were collected. RESULTS: EV-RNA detection was positive (up to 36 cycles) or weakly positive (37-39 cycles) in 22 out of 86 patients (25%). EV-RNA (positive or weakly positive signal) was detected in 5 out of 27 (18.5%) thyroid specimens with lymphocytic infiltration, and in 17 out of 59 (29%) thyroid specimens without lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.4). No correlation was observed between EV-RNA detection in thyroid and the presence of anti-TPOAb. EV-RNA was detected in 3 out of 11 patients histologically diagnosed as thyroiditis (27.3%) and in 18 out of 74 patients (24.3%) with thyroid tumours (multinodular goitre, adenoma and carcinoma) (P = 0.5) and in one patient with a normal thyroid. CONCLUSION: EV-RNA can be detected in thyroid tissue from patients with various thyroid diseases, but there is no relationship between the presence of EV-RNA and thyroiditis. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of EV in thyroid diseases.",M2
18538668,"Thyroid disorders in pregnancy: frequency and association with selected diseases and obstetrical complications in Tunisian women.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of thyroid disorders (TDs) and identify groups at risk for TDs in Tunisian pregnant women. METHODS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (<e>TPO</e>-Ab) were determined in 1519 pregnant women. Thyroid disorder was defined as hyperthyroidism (TSH&lt; or =0.10 mIU/L) or hypothyroidism (TSH&gt;4.5 mIU/L), and/or positive TPO-Ab (&gt;12 IU/L). RESULTS: TDs were observed in 147 women (9.7%). The prevalence was 6.5%, 3.2% and 1.3% for positive anti-TPO, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively. According to a trimester of gestation (first, second, and third, respectively), the prevalence decreases for positive TPO-Ab (7.7%, 7.5% and 4.7%) and for hyperthyroidism (2.7%, 0.7% and 0.5%), but increases for hypothyroidism (2.2%, 3.3% and 3.7%). TDs were more frequent in women with non-thyroid autoimmune disease [25% vs 9.6%; odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.16 (1.01-11.8); p=0.05]. Women with positive TPO-Ab showed higher prevalence of non-thyroid autoimmune disease [25% vs 6.4%; OR (95% CI), 4.90 (1.31-18.4); p=0.04] and a trend toward increase of past gestational hypertension (p=0.09), late abortion (p=0.09), and fetal death (p=0.09). Hypothyroidism was more frequent in women with non-thyroid autoimmune disease and those with past pregnancy loss. CONCLUSIONS: TDs are common in Tunisian pregnant women and are associated with autoimmune diseases and poor gestational outcomes. These data support the benefit of thyroid testing in pregnant women, especially those with these conditions.",M2
18509003,"BRAFV600E mutation, but not RET/PTC rearrangements, is correlated with a lower expression of both thyroperoxidase and sodium iodide symporter genes in papillary thyroid cancer.A low sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression has been shown in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) harboring the BRAFV600E mutation. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA expression of thyroid differentiation genes, glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and GLUT-3, in 78 PTCs according to the presence of BRAFV600E or RET/PTC rearrangements. We found BRAFV600E and RET/PTC rearrangements in 35.8 and 19.4% of PTCs respectively. The mRNA expression of NIS and thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) genes were significantly lower (P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.004 respectively) in BRAFV600E-positive PTC with respect to non-mutated samples. In support of this result, immunohistochemistry showed that the percentage of NIS-positive cells was significantly lower (P=0.005) in BRAFV600E-mutated PTC (mean 53.5%) than in negative cases (mean 72.6%). In contrast, no difference either in NIS or in any other thyroid differentiation genes' mRNA expression was found in PTC with or without RET/PTC rearrangements. When GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 mRNA expression was considered, no correlation was found either in BRAFV600E- nor in RET/PTC-mutated cases. In conclusion, this study confirmed the presence of a genetic alteration of BRAF and/or RET oncogenes in 64% of PTC cases and revealed a significant correlation of BRAFV600E mutation with a lower expression of both NIS and TPO. This latter finding could indicate that an early dedifferentiation process is present at the molecular level in BRAFV600E-mutated PTC, thus suggesting that the previously demonstrated poor prognostic significance of BRAFV600E mutation could be related to the dedifferentiation process more than to a more advanced stage at diagnosis.",M2
18505905,"Screening pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis.OBJECTIVE: Untreated maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy can have adverse consequences on maternal health and child intelligence quotient (IQ). Our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of screening pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease. DESIGN: We developed a state-transition Markov model and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening pregnant US women, aged 15-45 years, with no known history of thyroid disease, in the first trimester. METHODS: Three strategies were compared: 1) no screening, 2) one-time screening using anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) antibodies, and 3) one-time screening using TSH. Screening tests were added to the laboratory tests of the first prenatal visit. Abnormal screening tests were followed by further testing and subsequent thyroxine treatment of hypothyroid women. RESULTS: Screening pregnant women in the first trimester using TSH was cost-saving compared with no screening. Screening using anti-TPO antibodies was cost-effective compared with TSH screening with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,182 per quality-adjusted life year. Screening using TSH remained cost-saving across a wide range of ages at screening, costs of treatment, and probabilities of adverse outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of anti-TPO screening compared with TSH screening was mostly influenced by the probability of diagnosing hypothyroidism in unscreened subjects or subjects with a normal screening test. Screening remained highly cost-effective in scenarios where we assumed no improvement of child IQ outcomes by levothyroxine treatment. CONCLUSION: Screening all pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease in the first trimester is cost-effective compared with not screening.",M2
18466214,"Prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid dysfunction in young Brazilian patients with type 1 diabetes.Patients with an autoimmune condition are known to be at higher risk of developing other autoimmune disorders. Type 1 diabetes may be associated with additional autoimmune disorders including autoimmune thyroid disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in a group of children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes from northeastern Brazil as well as their significance for the development of thyroid disorders. The study design was cross-sectional and descriptive, analyzing young people with a previous type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Two hundred and fourteen children and adolescents with prior diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were evaluated. Antibodies to thyroperoxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) were determined in all patients and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The anti-TPO antibody test was positive in 54 out of the 214 patients studied, resulting in an overall prevalence of 25.2%. Among the anti-TPO-positive subjects, females were predominant (72%) over males (28%) (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 55.5% patients with positive anti-TPO antibodies had abnormal TSH levels. Clinically significant hypothyroidism was found in 29.6% and subclinical hypothyroidism in 22.2% of patients with positive anti-TPO. Hyperthyroidism was present in only 3% of them. Our results demonstrate the high prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with type 1 diabetes and the need for these patients of regular screening to make a precocious diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction.",M2
18466208,"Thyroid autoimmunity in children with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.AIM/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) in insulin-treated youth with clinical features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We evaluated prevalence of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (TGA) antibodies at onset of insulin-treated diabetes and follow-up in 183 White and Black children. Of these, 136 had a body mass index (BMI) &lt;85th percentile with 122 (89%) positive for beta-cell autoimmunity [type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)/group I], 25 were overweight (BMI &gt;or=85 th percentile) with or without acanthosis nigricans with beta-cell autoimmunity ['double' diabetes (DD)/group II], and 22 were overweight with no conventional beta-cell autoantibodies (group III). RESULTS: The prevalence of TPO and/or TGA was 39 and 29% (p = 0.19) in White and Black children and 39, 32, and 0% (p = 0.007) in groups I, II, and III, respectively. After a median follow-up of 60 months, 3.7, 4.3, and 0% developed hypothyroidism (increased thyroid-stimulating hormone with or without decreased free T4) in groups I, II, and III, respectively (p = 0.6). In subjects with TPO and/or TGA, hypothyroidism developed in 10 and 14% of groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.7). No child without thyroid antibodies developed hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinical features of T2DM who have evidence of beta-cell autoimmunity (DD), the frequency of thyroid antibodies and ATD is similar to that in classical T1DM. This suggests that TIDM comorbidities may be common in clinical T2DM patients who have beta-cell autoimmunity. Despite their obesity, youth with insulin-requiring diabetes should be screened for thyroid and possibly other T1DM-associated autoimmune diseases.",M2
18457671,"Reference intervals for TSH and thyroid hormones are mainly affected by age, body mass index and number of blood leucocytes, but hardly by gender and thyroid autoantibodies during the first decades of life.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to establish reference intervals for thyroid function tests in children and adolescents and to identify factors that may influence the limits of these intervals. METHODS: TSH, FT3, FT4, T3, T4, t-uptake, <e>TPO</e>-antibody (TPO-Ab) and TG-antibody (TG-Ab) levels were determined in blood of 1004 infants, children and adolescents by the Elecsys system (Roche). RESULTS: A distinct overall age-dependent decrease of analyte levels was found for all parameters investigated. Puberty was accompanied by an increase of TSH, FT3 and T3 levels. Results of T4 and t-uptake were significantly higher in girls compared to boys. The exclusion of children with increased TPO-Ab and TG-Ab had no significant effect on the limits of the reference interval. We found that besides age, BMI-SDS but also white blood cells count and gender played a role in the prediction of analyte variation. CONCLUSIONS: Covariates like BMI-SDS and white blood cell count should be taken into consideration when interpreting TSH and thyroid hormone measurements as well whereas gender and TPO-Ab or TG-Ab play a minor role.",M2
18457669,"Free thyroxine reference interval in each trimester of pregnancy determined with the Roche Modular E-170 electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.OBJECTIVE: To determine using a simplified study design trimester-specific FT4 reference intervals in pregnancy with the Roche Modular immunoassay in routine use. DESIGN AND METHODS: Surplus blood from 300 women in each trimester, drawn at documented times in the gestation, and from 40 age-matched nonpregnant women were assayed for FT4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and antithyroid peroxidase autoantibody (anti-<e>TPO</e>). RESULTS: After excluding women positive for anti-TPO and with abnormal TSH, reference intervals were calculated as 12.5-19.1 pmol/L (nonpregnant group), 11-19 pmol/L (first trimester), 9.7-17.5 pmol/L (second trimester) and 8.1-15.3 pmol/L (third trimester). 3rd trimester FT4 was significantly lower than that of the second trimester (p&lt;0.001) which, in turn, was lower than that of the first trimester (p&lt;0.001). FT4 reference intervals in pregnancy were significantly lower than in the nonpregnant women (p&lt;0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The observed trimester-specific FT4 reference intervals progressively decline with advancing gestation and differ significantly from one another.",M2

18432545,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) antibody positivity in patients with transverse myelitis and no visual manifestations.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe a subgroup of patients with IgG antibody to Aquaporin 4 Protein (AQP4) specific to neuromyelitis optica (NMO), who did not have clinical manifestations of optic nerve involvement at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: Assessment of five patients (four African Americans and one Latino) with myelitis, who were NMO IgG antibody positive, who had no detected optic nerve involvement, over a span of one to eighteen years. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated interleukin (IL6), oligoclonal bands (OCB), myelin basic protein (MBP), and elevated albumin and IgG index. Serology showed an association with antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and antithyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibody. Our patients responded well to acute treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and long-term treatment with oral prednisone and azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: The aquaporin protein autoimmune disease previously identified as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) may more correctly be identified as neuromyelitis (NM), and future diagnostic criteria should take into account the population of patients with antibody to aquaporin 4 protein, without clinically evident optic nerve pathology. Future research may indicate that the entity of NMO is a subcategory of the NM population.",M2
18363888,"Epitope recognition patterns of thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies in healthy individuals and patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis*.OBJECTIVE: Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are markers of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), but naturally occurring TPOAb are also detectable in healthy, euthyroid individuals. In AITD, circulating TPOAb react mainly with two immunodominant regions (IDR), IDR-A and IDR-B. The present study was undertaken in order to compare the epitope recognition pattern of TPOAb in HT patients and healthy subjects. DESIGN: Sera from 21 out of 98 healthy controls were selected on the basis of high TPOAb values, required for determination of TPOAb recognition pattern; as were sera from 92 HT patients. MEASUREMENTS: Measurement of IDR-reactivity was possible in 90 patients and 12 controls. IDR-A-, IDR-B- and non-IDR-A/non-IDR-B-Ab constituted 24 +/- 11%, 50 +/- 15% and 26 +/- 12%, respectively, in the patients. The distribution in the controls was distinctly different, only 12 +/- 13% being directed against IDR-A (P &lt; 0.002) and 66 +/- 22% against IDR-B (P &lt; 0.002). Half of the healthy individuals, vs. none of the HT patients, lacked IDR-A reactivity completely (P &lt; 0.0001). In HT patients, IDR-B-Ab proportions increased slightly with increasing TPOAb levels (P &lt; 0.05), while IDR-B-Ab of the controls showed a strong opposite trend (P &lt; 0.0001). Accordingly, the proportion of non-A/non-B-Ab correlated with TPOAb levels in the healthy controls (P &lt; 0.008), and an inverse correlation was seen in HT patients (P &lt; 0.02). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that TPOAb do not differ only in quantity between HT patients and healthy individuals, but may also follow distinct qualitative patterns. Larger studies are required to confirm this, and to determine whether the propensity to produce antibodies to certain <e>TPO</e> epitopes, for example, IDR-A, is of pathogenic relevance.",M2
18357551,"Selenium analogues of antithyroid drugs--recent developments.Thyroxine (T4), the main secretory hormone of the thyroid gland, is produced on thyroglobulin by thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>)/H(2)O(2)/iodide system and deiodinated to its active form (T3) by a selenocysteine-containing enzyme, iodothyronine deiodinase (ID). The activation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor by auto-antibodies leads to 'hyperthyroidism', a life-threatening disease which is treated by antithyroid drugs such as 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI). The present review describes the biological activities of a number of S/Se derivatives bearing the methimazole pharmacophore. It is shown that the isosteric substitutions in the existing drugs lead to compounds that can effectively and reversibly inhibit the heme-containing lactoperoxidase (LPO). In contrast to methimazole, the selenium analogue, MSeI, does not interfere with the enzyme directly, but it inhibits LPO by reducing the H(2)O(2) that is required for the oxidation of the Fe-center in LPO. These studies reveal that the degradation of the intracellular H(2)O(2) by the Se analogues of antithyroid drugs may be beneficial to the thyroid gland, as these compounds may act as antioxidants and protect thyroid cells from oxidative damage. Because the drugs with an action essentially on H(2)O(2) can reversibly inhibit the thyroid peroxidase, such drugs could be of great importance in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.",M2
18324487,"Association between parity and autoimmune thyroiditis in a general female population.BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid disease (AIT) is more common in females than in males. Furthermore, it is well documented that the risk of thyroid autoimmunity increases during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The objective of the present study was to analyse the association between parity and AIT by using ultrasound and serological data. METHODS: The study population included 2156 women, aged 20-79 years. Serum thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and thyrotropin levels were measured and thyroid ultrasonography was performed. AIT was defined according to the combined presence of a hypoechogenic thyroid pattern and positive anti-TPO levels (&gt;200 IU/ml). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The analyses revealed an association between parity and AIT. Women with at least one pregnancy had increased odds for AIT (OR 4.6 [95%-CI 1.4-15.1], p &lt; 0.05) compared to women who have never been pregnant. Similar results were observed using hypoechogenic thyroid pattern (OR 1.7 [95%-CI 1.0-2.9], p &lt; 0.05) and positive anti-TPO levels (OR 1.8 [95%-CI 1.0-3.3], p = 0.05) as separate dependent variables or using number of births as alternate independent variable. CONCLUSION: In this female population we found an association between parity and AIT and conclude that parity appears to be a potential risk factor for AIT.",M2
18322310,"Thyroid function and anti-thyroid antibodies in Iranian patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: influences of age and sex.Type 1 diabetes mellitus is frequently associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD).Genetic susceptibility for autoantibody formation in association with ATD and type 1 diabetes mellitus has been described with varying frequencies, but there is still debate about its prevailing situation in Iran. We have therefore investigated the prevalence of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and anti thyroglubolin (Anti TG) antibodies in type 1 diabetic patients, and compared the effect of age and sex on the thyroid autoimmunity in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Iran.Ninety one subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus and one hundred and sixty three unrelated normal controls under the age of thirty years were recruited for the detection of anti-TPO and anti-TG. Radio Immuno Assay and chemiluminescence methods were used for anti-TPO and anti-TG detection respectively.Among 91 type 1 diabetic patients, 36 (39.6%) were positive for anti-TPO and 27(30%) were positive for antiTG. Anti-TPO antibodies were detected only in 6.7% of control group. Comparing with those without thyroid autoimmunity, there was a female preponderance for the type 1 diabetic patients with thyroid autoimmunity (female: male, 28:14 vs. 28:20 respectively). Among the type 1 diabetic patients those with thyroid autoimmunity, tended to be older (p: 0.04) and to have higher TSH concentration (p: 0.03). Patients with high anti-TPO levels had longer duration of diabetes (P: 0.02).The presence of anti-TPO in 39.6% of our type 1 diabetic patients comparing with 8.5% of normal subjects confirmed the strong association of ATD and type 1 diabetes mellitus.",M2
18304414,"Anti-Scl-70 antibodies in autoimmune hypothyroidism.The relationship between autoimmune thyroiditis and systemic sclerosis is controversial. Data exist on the presence of thyroid autoantibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis but, as far as we could ascertain, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, which are highly specific for systemic sclerosis, have not been investigated in autoimmune hypothyroidism. This study compares the presence of anti-Scl-70 in females with autoimmune hypothyroidism (n = 24) and in healthy age-matched female controls (n = 26). Free thyroxine levels were similar in both groups. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>), antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and index values for anti-Scl-70 levels were significantly higher in patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism compared with controls, although the anti-Scl-70 test was negative in both groups. Anti-TPO, anti-Tg and TSH significantly correlated with anti-Scl-70. In conclusion, autoimmune hypothyroidism seems to be associated with a higher index level of anti-Scl-70, yet a negative anti-Scl-70 antibody test. This suggests that autoimmune hypothyroidism might have common aetiological factors with systemic sclerosis.",M2
18302514,"No immunological benefit of selenium in consecutive patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.BACKGROUND: Recently it has been demonstrated that after selenium (Se) supplementation in autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) patients, there was a significant decrease of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) autoantibody (TPOAb) levels. The aim of our study was to evaluate the immunological benefit of Se administration in unselected AIT patients and thus address the question whether Se administration should generally be recommended for AIT patients. METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive AIT patients (aged 19-85 years) were included in the present study. In addition to their levothyroxine (LT(4)) treatment, 18 patients received 200 microg (2.53 micromol) sodium selenite per day orally for the time span of 3 months, whereas 18 patients received placebo. All patients had measurement of thyroid hormones, thyrotropin (TSH), autoantibodies (thyroglobulin antibodies [TgAb] and TPOAb), Se levels, and intracellular cytokine detection in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry before and after Se or placebo administration. RESULTS: No significant difference in the TPOAb levels was found after Se administration (524 +/- 452 vs. 505 +/- 464 IU/mL; p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the CD4(+) or CD8(+) cytokine pattern (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta) in patients before and after Se administration, in patients before and after placebo administration and between Se group and placebo group before and after Se vs. placebo administration. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that Se administration in our AIT patient's cohort does not induce significant immunological changes, either in terms of cytokine production patterns of peripheral T lymphocytes or of TPOAb levels. Our data suggest that AIT patients with moderate disease activity (in terms of TPOAb and cytokine production patterns) may not (equally) benefit as patients with high disease activity.",M2
18299471,"Smoking is negatively associated with the presence of thyroglobulin autoantibody and to a lesser degree with thyroid peroxidase autoantibody in serum: a population study.BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid diseases are common and the prevalence of circulating thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody, <e>TPO</e>-Ab and thyroglobulin antibody, Tg-Ab) is high in the population. The knowledge of a possible association between lifestyle factors and circulating thyroid antibodies is limited. AIM: To evaluate the correlation between smoking habits and the presence of circulating TPO-Ab and Tg-Ab. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional comparative population study performed in two areas of Denmark with moderate and mild iodine deficiency, 4649 randomly selected subjects from the population in some predefined age groups between 18 and 65 years were examined. Blood tests were analysed for TPO-Ab and Tg-Ab using assays based on the RIA technique. The participants answered questionnaires, were clinically examined and blood and urine samples collected. RESULTS: Data were analysed in multivariate logistic regression models. There was a negative association between smoking and the presence of thyroid autoantibodies in serum. This association was observed for the presence of TPO-Ab and/or Tg-Ab, TPO-Ab (without respect to Tg-Ab status), Tg-Ab (without respect to TPO-Ab status) and both antibodies together. The association between smoking and thyroid autoantibodies was stronger for Tg-Ab than for TPO-Ab. There was no association between smoking and TPO-Ab measured alone or between smoking and TPO-Ab when Tg-Ab was included in the model as an explanatory variable. CONCLUSION: Smoking was negatively associated with the presence of thyroid autoantibodies with the strongest association between smoking and Tg-Ab. The study design precludes any conclusions as to the cause of the negative association between smoking thyroid autoantibodies.",M2
18271683,"Anti-Helicobacter Pylori, anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin and anti-gastric parietal cells antibodies in Czech population.Autoimmune thyropathies are frequently linked to many infections, such as Helicobacter pylori, which are also supposed to play a role in their pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between thyroid and gastric autoimmunity and H. pylori infection on a large sample of Czech population (n=1621) by monitoring the autoantibodies against thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and gastric parietal cell (anti-GPC, representing thyrogastric syndrome) in correlation with antibodies against Helicobacter pylori (anti-H. pylori) of classes IgG and IgA. The interrelation between autoantibodies and H. pylori antibodies was assessed by H. pylori seropositivity. In H. pylori seropositive persons as compared to seronegative irrespective of age and sex, a higher occurrence of anti-TPO (10.4 % vs. 5.8 %, p=0.001) and anti-GPC (6.1 % vs. 1.7 %, p&lt;0.001) was found. Differences in anti-TPO occurrence were significant in both men (7.0 % vs. 3.3 %, p=0.03) and women (12.7 % vs. 8.0 %, p=0.02), differences in anti-GPC occurrence were significant only in women (7.2 % vs. 1.7 %, p&lt;0.001). Results of this study support the idea of a connection between infection of H. pylori and the occurrence of anti-TPO autoantibodies representing thyroid autoimmunity and gastric parietal cells autoantibodies representing the thyrogastric syndrome.",M2
18265539,"Thyroid dysfunction in patients with Down syndrome.BACKGROUND: The close relationship between thyroid disorder and Down syndrome (DS) had been widely reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence rate and the pattern of thyroid dysfunction in DS in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 50 Down syndrome (DS) patients from Yang-Ming Home for Disabled, were recruited. In all patients, serum T3, T4, free T4, TSH, thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-<e>TPO</e>) and anti-TSH receptor antibody were measured. The control group consisted of 212 healthy adults who underwent routine health examination in this hospital. RESULTS: Among 50 DS patients, 8 had subclinical hypothyroidism and one had hyperthyroidism. There was no statistically significant in gender and age between DS and control groups, however, TSH anomaly was significantly higher in the DS group (p = 0.008). Regarding thyroid autoantibodies, anti-TPO was positive in 13 cases (26%) and anti-TSH receptor was positive in 2 cases (4%). Statistically, there was no significant difference in TSH anomaly (p = 0.7), positive anti-TPO antibody (p = 0.097) and positive anti-TSH receptor antibody (p = 1.0) between males and females. The increased TSH levels had no statistically positive correlation with anti-TPO (p = 0.386) or anti-TSH receptor antibody (p=1) in this study. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was 18% (9/50) in DS patients in Taiwan. Most of them showed subclinical compensated hypothyroidism (16%, 8/50), and one (2%, 1/50) showed hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid dysfunction is common in DS patients, so periodic thyroid function tests should be performed and early treatment should be given to prevent further intellectual deterioration and improve overall development.",M2
18238739,"Association of first-trimester thyroid function test values with thyroperoxidase antibody status, smoking, and multivitamin use.OBJECTIVE: To determine first-trimester thyroid function values and associations with thyroperoxidase antibody (<e>TPO</e>-Ab) status, smoking, emesis, and iodine-containing multivitamin use. METHODS: We collected information by interview, questionnaire, and blood draw at the initial obstetric visit in 668 pregnant women without known thyroid disease. We compared thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine (T4), and free T4 index (FT4I) values by TPO-Ab status. Multiple regression was used to identify characteristics associated with thyroid function values. RESULTS: The following median (range containing 95% of the data points) thyroid function test values were obtained in 585 TPO-Ab-negative women: TSH, 1.1 mIU/L (0.04-3.6); FT4I, 2.1 (1.5-2.9); and T4, 9.9 microg/dL (7.0-14.0). The following median (range containing 95% of the data points) thyroid function test values were obtained in 83 TPO-Ab-positive women: TSH, 1.8 mIU/L (0.3-6.4) (P&lt;.001); FT4I, 2.0 (1.4-2.7) (P = .06); and T4, 9.3 microg/dL (6.8-13.0) (P = .03) (P values denote statistically significant differences between TPO-Ab-positive and negative participants). Among TPO-Ab-negative participants, TSH level was not associated with use of iodine-containing multivitamins, smoking, or race. TSH increased 0.03 mIU/L for every year of maternal age (P = .03) and decreased by 0.3 mIU/L for every increase in parity (P&lt;.001). T4 decreased 0.04 microg/dL for every year of maternal age (P = .04). Mean FT4I was 2.05 in smokers and 2.20 in nonsmokers (P&lt;.01). There were no relationships between T4 or FT4I and parity, race, or iodine-containing multivitamin use. CONCLUSION: TPO-Ab status of pregnant women should be considered when constructing trimester-specific reference ranges because elevated serum TPO-Ab levels are associated with higher TSH and lower T4 values.",M2
18230830,"Negative correlation between thyroperoxidase and dual oxidase H2O2-generating activities in thyroid nodular lesions.Iodine incorporation into thyroglobulin is dependent on the activities of both thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and thyroid dual oxidase 2 (DuOx2). Although TPO expression is decreased in some thyroid nodular lesions, DuOx1 and 2 mRNA expressions are maintained, but DuOx H2O2-generating activity has never been evaluated in such tumors. Our goal was to determine DuOx activity in hypofunctioning lesions of the thyroid. We evaluated H2O2 generation by DuOx in 12 paranodular to cold nodule samples, 17 non-toxic multinodular goiters (MNG; 33 samples), 3 papillary carcinomas (PC; 4 samples), 3 follicular carcinomas (FC; 4 samples), and 10 follicular adenomas. DuOx activity was detected in all paranodular tissues (121+/-23 nmol H2O2/h per mg protein), but was undetectable (&lt;1 nmol H2O2 generated) in all PC, two out of four FC samples and seven out of ten adenomas. In 11 MNG at least two different areas of the goiter have been evaluated, and in 5 of these goiters one of the samples had DuOx activity below the limit of detection. The coefficient of variation in MNG samples ranged from 11.3 to 57.2%. Interestingly, in all the adenomas studied, TPO activity (486+/-142 U/g protein, n=8) was well within the range found in paranodular tissues (414+/-116 U/g protein, n=3). We found a significant negative correlation between DuOx and TPO activities, suggesting that these enzymes are regulated in opposite directions, at least in thyroid tumors.",M2
18230828,"Serum TSH and serum thyroid peroxidase antibody fluctuate in parallel and high urinary iodine excretion predicts subsequent thyroid failure in a 1-year study of patients with untreated subclinical hypothyroidism.OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of predicting decline or improvement in thyroid function over 1 year, and to investigate the correlations of serum TSH (s-TSH) with hypothyroidism-related symptoms and signs, serum thyroid peroxidase antibody (s-<e>TPO</e>-Ab) and urinary iodine excretion in individual patients with untreated subclinical hypothyroidism (SH). DESIGN: Monthly repeated measurement study without intervention. METHODS: Twenty-one patients without former thyroid disease who had been identified with s-TSH between 5 and 12 mU/l and normal serum thyroxine (s-T4) at two occasions were enrolled. Subsequently, 13 monthly measurements of s-TSH, hypothyroidism-related symptoms and signs, serum free T4, s-TPO-Ab and urinary iodine excretion were performed. RESULTS: Over the study year, s-TSH increased significantly in 5 patients, 16 had unchanged s-TSH, whereas none improved. From clinical and biochemical inclusion data, it was not possible to predict who would later increase in s-TSH. In individual patients, a highly significant correlation between s-TSH and s-TPO-Ab was found (r=0.37, P&lt;0.0001) and also between s-TSH and urinary iodine excretion (r=0.14, P=0.034). No correlation between s-TSH and clinical symptoms and signs was observed. Time shift showed best correlation between s-TSH and s-TPO-Ab measured at the same time point, whereas urinary iodine excretion correlated best to s-TSH and s-TPO-Ab obtained 1 month later. CONCLUSION: At the time of inclusion, it was not possible to identify the 24% of SH patients who would show deterioration in thyroid function over the following year. Impairment in thyroid function varied in parallel with thyroid autoimmunity, whereas high urinary iodine excretion predicted high s-TSH and s-TPO-Ab 1 month later.",M2
18212751,"Utility of malignancy markers in fine-needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules: comparison of Hector Battifora mesothelial antigen-1, thyroid peroxidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV.The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic interest of Hector Battifora mesothelial antigen-1 (HBME-1), thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>), and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPP4) in thyroid fine-needle aspirates obtained from 200 resected thyroid lesions (55 colloid nodules, 54 follicular adenomas, 59 papillary cancers, and 32 follicular carcinomas). Hector Battifora mesothelial antigen-1 or TPO expression (% positive cells) and DPP4 staining score (12-point scale) were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and optimal cutoff values for diagnosing malignancy were determined. The TPO ROC curve was consistently higher than the HBME-1 ROC curve. The TPO curve was also higher than the DPP4 curve with regard to sensitivity, but dipped below the DPP4 curve with regard to specificity. Using a cutoff value of &lt;80% positive cells for TPO, &gt;10% positive cells for HBME-1, and staining score &gt; or =1 for DPP4, sensitivity to specificity ratios were 98-83% for TPO, 90-60% for HBME-1, and 88-80% for DPP4. Two particularly interesting findings of this study were the low negative likelihood ratio of TPO (0.02) allowing highly reliable exclusion of malignancy and the 100% specificity of DPP4 staining scores=12. Due to poor performance on follicular lesions, HBME-1 showed no advantage over TPO or DPP4.",M2
18202223,"Angiopoietin-like 5 and IGFBP2 stimulate ex vivo expansion of human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells as assayed by NOD/SCID transplantation.Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the basis of bone marrow transplantation and are attractive target cells for hematopoietic gene therapy, but these important clinical applications have been severely hampered by difficulties in ex vivo expansion of HSCs. In particular, the use of cord blood for adult transplantation is greatly limited by the number of HSCs. Previously we identified angiopoietin-like proteins and IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as new hormones that, together with other factors, can expand mouse bone marrow HSCs in culture. Here, we measure the activity of multipotent human severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-repopulating cells (SRCs) by transplantation into the nonobese diabetic SCID (NOD/SCID) mice; secondary transplantation was performed to evaluate the self-renewal potential of SRCs. A serum-free medium containing SCF, <e>TPO</e>, and FGF-1 or Flt3-L cannot significantly support expansion of the SRCs present in human cord blood CD133+ cells. Addition of either angiopoietin-like 5 or IGF-binding protein 2 to the cultures led to a sizable expansion of HSC numbers, as assayed by NOD/SCID transplantation. A serum-free culture containing SCF, TPO, FGF-1, angiopoietin-like 5, and IGFBP2 supports an approximately 20-fold net expansion of repopulating human cord blood HSCs, a number potentially applicable to several clinical processes including HSC transplantation.",M2
19480304,"Autoimmune thyroid disease--a continuous spectrum.AIM: to present a case report revealing a variant of natural history of autoimmune thyroid disease. CASE REPORT: I.F., a 39 years old woman, had a previous medical history of Graves' disease treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD). After 1 year of treatment, the remission was confirmed one and two years after ATD withdrawal. Twenty years after the initial hyperthyroidism, spontaneous subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed. The patient presented both anti TSH-receptor (TSH-R) antibodies (Ab), antithyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and antithyroglobulin (antiTgl) antibodies in elevated titres. CONCLUSION: Because of the shift from hyperthyroidism to euthyroidism or to spontaneous hypothyroidism, Graves' disease patients demand a strict follow-up after ATD therapy. It seems that there is an effect of TPOAb on thyroid destruction.",M2
18073303,"Antithyroperoxidase antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in autoimmune thyroid disease.CONTEXT: Thyroid antibody-dependent cytotoxicity has been reported in autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Indeed, the role of thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) autoantibodies (aAbs) in complement-mediated damage by binding to TPO expressed on the surface of human thyroid cells was demonstrated, whereas their activity in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) is not well established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define the partners involved in antibody and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in AITD and characterize which effector cells are involved in cytotoxicity mediated by anti-TPO aAbs using a chromium release assay. RESULTS: The relative capability of anti-TPO aAbs to mediate ADCC using human thyroid cells in culture varies from 11 to 74.5%, depending on the effectors cells used. The human monocyte cell line HL60 gives a better lysis than the THP-1 cell line as effector cells. It seems obvious that the mechanism of ADCC is mediated quite exclusively by FcgammaRI. Indeed, the two effector cell lines differ by the level of the FcgammaRI expression (91.83% for HL-60 cells and 22.55%t for the THP-1). In addition to ADCC, the anti-TPO aAbs mediate the destruction of thyrocytes by CDC (56%). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that anti-TPO aAbs can damage cultured thyroid cells by ADCC and CDC mechanisms. The monocytes, via their FcgammaRI, are important effector cells in ADCC mediated by anti-TPO aAbs and may contribute with T cells to the destruction of thyroid gland in AITD.",M2
18070829,"The role of thrombophilia and thyroid autoimmunity in unexplained infertility, implantation failure and recurrent spontaneous abortion.BACKGROUND: The role of thrombophilia and thyroid autoimmunity in unexplained infertility (UI), implantation failure (IF) and recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is controversial and poorly understood. METHODS: From March, 2004 to January, 2007, 119 women were prospectively included: 32 oocyte donors, 31 patients with UI, 26 with IF and 30 with RSA. The IF and RSA groups presented normal preimplantation genetic screening. Protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant, activated protein C resistance (APCR), immunoglobulin M and G anticardiolipin antibodies, homocystine, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, anti-thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and anti-thyroglobulin (TG) antibodies were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of thrombophilia was high and similar among groups. In the IF group, the prevalence of APCR (15.4%), lupus anticoagulant (11.5%) and combined thrombophilia (19.2%) was higher, but not significantly different, than the other three groups. The prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in women with IF (anti-TPO antibodies, P = 0.009; anti-TPO plus anti-TG antibodies,P = 0.04) and UI (anti-TPO, P = 0.002; anti-TG, P = 0.019; anti-TPO plus anti-TG antibodies, P = 0.005) was significantly increased in comparison to those with RSA. There was also a trend towards a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in the UI and IF groups than in the control group. TSH and free thyroxine levels all remained within a normal range. CONCLUSIONS: When embryo aneuploidy is ruled out, thrombophilia could constitute an etiologic factor in IF. Furthermore, thyroid autoimmunity is strongly related to UI and IF.",M2
18064720,"Effect of oxidative stress on rat thyrocyte iodide metabolism.Thyroid cells fall into the type of cells functioning during continuous production of high H(2)O(2) concentrations. We studied the effect of H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mM) on the activities of the key steps of iodide metabolism (uptake, oxidation and organification) in thyrocytes cultivated in an organ culture. After 60 min cultivation of cells in a medium containing H(2)O(2) at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0 mM iodide (I(-)) uptake, thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) activity and I(-) organification were completely inhibited. No restoration of the parameters studied was observed within the subsequent 24 h of cultivation. The inhibitory effect of 0.1 mM H(2)O(2) was reversible. Activation of I(-) uptake in the cultivated tissue and a 520-880% increase of the total I(-) content were observed after 8 and 24 h. The concentration of I(-) protein-bound fraction was raised by 220% after 24 h. A biphasic effect of 0.1 mM H(2)O(2) on TPO was observed: 76.2% and 72.2% inhibitions were seen after 2 and 8 h, respectively, whereas 40.0% enzyme activation was after 5 h. TPO activity was partially restored after 24 h and amounted to 65% of the initial value. The significant increase in the concentration of iodide protein-bound fraction, which was observed simultaneously with TPO inhibition, could be due to thyroglobulin non-enzymic iodination under H(2)O(2)-generated oxidative stress. The data obtained indicate that iodide oxidation, as a step in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, was most sensitive to oxidative stress activation. The impaired iodide uptake and its organification during oxidative stress can play a pathogenetic role in disturbed functions of thyroid cells.",M2
18031322,"Immunohistochemical staining for thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) of needle core biopsies in the diagnosis of scintigraphically cold thyroid nodules.BACKGROUND: Cold thyroid nodules are common, in particular in iodine-deficient areas, but only a minority of them are malignant requiring surgery. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) immunostaining of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) material has proven helpful in diagnosing cells from malignant lesions, but the procedure has its limitations in a routine setting. PURPOSE: To improve diagnosis and reduce surgery rate, the FNAC procedure was replaced by needle core biopsy (NCB), which was routinely stained for TPO by the monoclonal antibody mAb 47. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 5-year period 427 consecutive patients with a cold thyroid nodule were evaluated by ultrasound-guided NCB, which had been routinely stained for TPO in an automated immunostainer. Sensitivity and specificity and predictive values of the TPO immunostaining were estimated, based on the final diagnosis obtained from surgical resection. RESULTS: The majority of nodules with benign NCB diagnosis were not surgically removed, and thus a subgroup of 140 operated nodules formed the basis for the calculations. Sensitivity and specificity for benign and malignant lesions were 100% if the oxyphilic variant of adenomas and minimally invasive follicular carcinomas were excluded. By inclusion of these, the values fell to 89% and 97%, respectively. The predictive value of a positive test was 96% and the predictive value of a negative test was 97%. CONCLUSION: TPO immunostaining was found to be a valuable adjunct to morphology in the diagnosis of cold thyroid nodules of the nonoxyphilic type.",M2
18029453,"Pseudodominant inheritance of goitrous congenital hypothyroidism caused by <e>TPO</e> mutations: molecular and in silico studies.CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Most cases of goitrous congenital hypothyroidism (CH) from thyroid dyshormonogenesis 1) follow a recessive mode of inheritance and 2) are due to mutations in the thyroid peroxidase gene (TPO). We report the genetic mechanism underlying the apparently dominant inheritance of goitrous CH in a nonconsanguineous family of French Canadian origin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two brothers identified by newborn TSH screening had severe hypothyroidism and a goiter with increased (99m)Tc uptake. The mother was euthyroid, but the father and two paternal uncles had also been diagnosed with goitrous CH. After having excluded PAX8 gene mutations, we hypothesized that the underlying defect could be TPO mutations. RESULTS: Both compound heterozygous siblings had inherited a mutant TPO allele carried by their mother (c.1496delC; p.Pro499Argfs2X), and from their father, one brother had inherited a missense mutation (c.1978C--&gt;G; p.Gln660Glu) and the other an insertion (c.1955insT; p.Phe653Valfs15X). The thyroid gland of one uncle who is a compound heterozygote for TPO mutations (p.Phe653Valfs15X/p.Gln660Glu) was removed because of concurrent multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. Immunohistochemistry revealed normal TPO staining, implying that Gln660Glu TPO is expressed properly. Modeling of this mutant in silico suggests that its three-dimensional structure is conserved, whereas the electrostatic binding energy between the Gln660Glu TPO and its heme group becomes repulsive. CONCLUSION: We report a pedigree presenting with pseudodominant goitrous CH due to segregation of three different TPO mutations. Although goitrous CH generally follows a recessive mode of inheritance, the high frequency of TPO mutations carriers may lead to pseudodominant inheritance.",M2
17963848,"Anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies from patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy bind to cerebellar astrocytes.A cohort of 10 Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) patients, 33 patients with unrelated neurological symptoms, 12 Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and 4 healthy adult donors was studied to explore the neurological targets of anti-thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) autoantibodies (aAb) in HE. High levels of anti-TPO aAb were only detected in HE group's cerebrospinal fluids. In immunofluorescence assays on monkey brain cerebellum sections, both HE patients' sera and anti-TPO monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were able to bind cerebellar cells expressing glial fibrillary acid protein. Normal human astrocytes from primary cultures also reacted with anti-TPO mAb. Specific astrocyte binding of anti-TPO aAb suggests a role of these aAb in the HE pathogenesis.",M2
17956159,"Uptake and gene expression with antitumoral doses of iodine in thyroid and mammary gland: evidence that chronic administration has no harmful effects.Several studies have demonstrated that moderately high concentrations of molecular iodine (I(2)) diminish the symptoms of mammary fibrosis in women, reduce the occurrence of mammary cancer induced chemically in rats (50-70%), and have a clear antiproliferative and apoptotic effect in the human tumoral mammary cell line MCF-7. Nevertheless, the importance of these effects has been underestimated, in part because of the notion that exposure to excess iodine represents a potential risk to thyroid physiology. In the present work we demonstrate that uptake and metabolism of iodine differ in an organ-specific manner and also depend on the chemical form of the iodine ingested (potassium iodide vs. I(2)). Further, we show that a moderately high I(2) supplement (0.05%) causes some of the characteristics of the  acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect ; namely, it lowers expression of the sodium/iodide symporter, pendrin, thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>), and deiodinase type 1 in thyroid gland without diminishing circulating levels of thyroid hormone. Finally, we confirm that I(2) metabolism is independent of TPO, and we demonstrate that, at the doses used here, which are potentially useful to treat mammary tumors, chronic I(2) supplement is not accompanied by any harmful secondary effects on the thyroid or general physiology. Thus, we suggest that I(2) could be considered for use in clinical trials of breast cancer therapies.",M2
17880809,"[Analysis of intracellular proapoptotic (Bax, Bak) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) proteins expression in thyrocytes from young patients with immune and non-immune thyroid disorders]Apoptosis one of the form of programmed cell death is a physiological occurrence, requisite to the correct function of every organism. This is an active process that proceeds with a participation of the cellular metabolism embracing the activation of genes and the synthesis of proteins. The signal to apoptosis can be started practically in every cell of our organism. Disturbances of the apoptosis regulation determine the essential link of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disorders. The aim of this study was to estimate the expression of proapoptotic (Bax, Bak) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) proteins in thyroid tissues from 12 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 10 with non-toxic nodular goitre (NTNG) and 10 with toxic nodular goitre (TNG). Criteria for qualification of Graves' patients: large goitre, ophthalmopathy, TRAb &gt; 5 U/L, positive titre of anti-<e>TPO</e> and anti-TG antibodies and concentration of TSH &lt;0.45 microIU/mL more the 2-3 months from onset of the disease. Detection of apoptotic proteins in thyroid follicular cells was performed by Western Blot. These analysis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies in DAB chromogene visuality and marked by Mayer's haematoxylin. Identification of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL molecules in the thyroid follicular cells revealed a higher expression of both proteins in patients with Graves' disease (+++; ++, respectively) in comparison to patients with NTNG (++/+; +) and TNG (++; +). The detection of proapoptotic molecules showed higher expression of Bak (++/+) and Bax (+) in Graves' thyroid tissues while Bax was in trace amount in NTNG (0/+) and TNG (0/+). We conclude that alteration in the expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins on surface of thyroid follicular cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmune disorders. In addition, suppression of apoptosis in Graves' disease led to predominance for proliferation of thyroid follicular cells which is responsible for goitre formation.",M2
17822378,"Thyroid peroxidase as an autoantigen.Thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) evokes high-affinity, IgG-class autoantibodies [TPO autoantibodies (TPOAbs)] and TPO-specific T cells that are markers of thyroid infiltration or implicated in thyroid destruction, respectively. A diverse repertoire of human monoclonal TPOAbs, unparalleled in other autoimmune diseases, provides invaluable probes for investigating antibody epitopes. Human TPOAbs recognize an immunodominant region comprising overlapping A and B domains on conformationally intact TPO. Amino acids recognized by TPOAbs are located in the regions with homology to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the complement control protein (CCP) but not in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like region. T cells recognize epitopes in the MPO-like region but not in the CCP- or EGF-like regions in humans. Monoclonal human TPOAbs modulate processing of TPO protein to provide peptides for some T cells. A human T cell clone expressed transgenically in mice induces lymphocytic infiltration and hypothyroidism. This T cell's epitope is only generated by thyrocyte processing of endogenous TPO. Further, intact TPO expressed in vivo is also required for induction of TPOAbs in mice that resemble human autoantibodies. Overall, some TPO-specific T cells and the majority of autoantibodies in humans develop in response to TPO presented by thyroid cells, rather than to TPO released by damaged thyrocytes.",M2
17714035,"Nitric oxide/cGMP signaling inhibits TSH-stimulated iodide uptake and expression of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin mRNA in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.OBJECTIVE: Nitric oxide (NO) induces morphological and functional alterations in primary cultured thyroid cells. The aim of this paper was to analyze the direct influence of a long-term exposition to NO on parameters of thyroid hormone biosynthesis in FRTL-5 cells. DESIGN: Cells were treated with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for 24-72 h. MAIN OUTCOME: SNP (50-500 micromol/L) reduced iodide uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of iodide uptake increased progressively with time and matched nitrite accumulation. SNP inhibited thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner. SNP enhanced 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. 3',5'-cyclic adenosine phosphate (cAMP) generation was reduced by a high SNP concentration after 48 h. 8-Bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP analog, inhibited iodide uptake as well as TPO and TG mRNA expression. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) inhibitor KT-5823 reversed SNP or 8-Br-cGMP-inhibited iodide uptake. Thyroid-stimulating hormone pretreatment for 24-48 h prevented SNP-reduced iodide uptake although nitrite levels remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: These findings favor a long-term inhibitory role of the NO/cGMP pathway on parameters of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. A novel property of NO to inhibit TPO and TG mRNA expression is supported. The NO action on iodide uptake could involve cGK mediation. The long-term inhibition of steps of thyroid hormonogenesis by NO could be of interest in thyroid pathophysiology.",M2
17709379,"The forkhead factor FoxE1 binds to the thyroperoxidase promoter during thyroid cell differentiation and modifies compacted chromatin structure.The Forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors play diverse roles in differentiation, development, hormone responsiveness, and aging. A pioneer activity of the Forkhead factors in developmental processes has been reported, but how this may apply to other contexts of Forkhead factor regulation remains unexplored. In this study, we address the pioneer activity of the thyroid-specific factor FoxE1 during thyroid differentiation. In response to hormone induction, FoxE1 binds to the compacted chromatin of the inactive thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) promoter, which coincides with the appearance of strong DNase I hypersensitivity at the FoxE1 binding site. In vitro, FoxE1 can bind to its site even when this is protected by a nucleosome, and it creates a local exposed domain specifically on H1-compacted TPO promoter-containing nucleosome arrays. Furthermore, nuclear factor 1 binds to the TPO promoter simultaneously with FoxE1, and this binding has an additive effect on FoxE1-mediated chromatin structure alteration. On the basis of our findings, we propose that FoxE1 is a pioneer factor whose primary mechanistic role in mediating the hormonal regulation of the TPO gene is to enable other regulatory factors to access the chromatin. The presented model extends the reported pioneer activity of the Forkhead factors to processes involved in hormone-induced differentiation.",M2
17704020,"High prevalence of goiter in an iodine replete area: do thyroid auto-antibodies play a role?INTRODUCTION: Despite long standing iodine supplementation in Iran the prevalence of goiter remains high in some areas. This may suggest that causes other than iodine deficiency, such as autoimmune thyroid diseases, should also be considered. We therefore assessed the prevalence of anti-thyroid antibodies in children living in an inland area in Iran and correlated these findings with prevalence of goiter within this region. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 1948 students were selected by multistage random cluster sampling from the 108 primary schools (age, 7-13 year-old) of the urban and rural areas of Semirom. After obtaining written consent from their parents, the children were examined by endocrinologists for goiter grading. Grade 2 goitrous children (108 cases) were compared with non-goitrous children (111 children as control group) for anti-thyroid antibodies. RESULTS: Overall, 36.7% of 1948 students had goiter. The mean urinary iodine excretion level was 1.49+/-0.7 micromol/L. This was within normal limits. Of 219 children studied, 4.3% presented with subclinical hypothyroidism, and 7.3% had positive anti-thyroid antibodies. There was non-significant difference of positive thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-<e>TPO</e>) (Odds Ratio= 3.2, p= 0.13) but significant difference of anti Tg between goitrous and non goitrous children (Odds Ratio: 5.6, 95% CI: 1.18-26.0, p: 0.015). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that autoimmunity may be one of the mechanisms responsible for goiter persistence after iodine replenishment in this iodine deficient region, but the role of other factors should also be considered.",M2
17696828,"Effects of 12 months treatment with L-selenomethionine on serum anti-<e>TPO</e> Levels in Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of selenium (Se) treatment on serum anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) levels in Greek patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). DESIGN: We prospectively studied 80 women with HT, median age 37 (range 24-52) years, for 1 year. All patients received 200 microg Se in the form of l-selenomethionine orally for 6 months. At the end of the 6-month period, 40 patients continued taking 200 microg Se (Group A) and 40 patients stopped (Group B). Serum thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), anti-TPO, and anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) levels were measured at baseline and at the end of each 3-month period. MAIN OUTCOME: There was a significant reduction of serum anti-TPO levels during the first 6 months (by 5.6% and 9.9% at 3 and 6 months, respectively). An overall reduction of 21% (p &lt; 0.0001) compared with the basal values was noted in Group A. In Group B, serum anti-TPO levels were increased by 4.8% (p &lt; 0.0001) during the second 6-month period. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that in HT patients 6 months of Se treatment caused a significant decrease in serum anti-TPO levels, which was more profound in the second trimester. The extension of Se supplementation for 6 more months resulted in an additional 8% decrease, while the cessation caused a 4.8% increase, in the anti-TPO concentrations.",M2
17651886,"Effects of a 5-day treatment with the UV-filter octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC) on the function of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid function in rats.Octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC) is one of the most frequently used UV-filters in sunscreens to protect the skin against the noxious influence of UV radiation. Recently, OMC was suspected to act as an  endocrine active chemical  (EAC) with estrogenic actions. While EACs have been investigated thoroughly for interference with reproductive function in mammalians, surprisingly little efforts have been made to investigate an interference of EACs with the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis despite the expression of estrogen receptors in all parts of this axis. Therefore, we conducted an in vivo study with ovariectomised rats treated for 5 days with different doses of OMC or 17beta-estradiol (E2) as a control. Determined parameters comprised serum levels of TSH, T4 and T3, hypothalamic TRH mRNA expression, protein-expression of the sodium-iodide-symporter (NIS) and the TSH receptor and the activities of thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) in the thyroid and the T3-responsive hepatic type I 5'deiodinase (Dio1) in the liver. While E2 did not affect TSH-, T4- or T3-levels, OMC caused a dose-dependent decrease of serum concentrations of all of these hormones. TRH expression remained unaffected, while in the thyroid, expression of the TSH receptor but not of NIS was stimulated by OMC. TPO activity was unaltered but Dio1 activity was reduced by OMC. Thus, our results demonstrate a non-estrogenic interference of OMC within the rodent HPT axis with inadequate feedback response to impaired thyroid hormone status, indicated by decreased serum thyroid hormone and hepatic Dio1 levels.",M2
17612898,"Heritability of levels of autoantibodies to thyroid antigens using the method of plotting regression of offspring on midparent (ROMP).Only a few methods can be applied in a simple manner to estimate the genetic control of autoimmunity in humans. Here we examined the heritability of autoantibodies to two thyroid antigens; thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>, formerly known as thyroid microsomal antigen), using methods of regression of offspring on mid-parental values (ROMP). With the data sets available, affected and unaffected siblings were compared by this rapid screening method using results determined by hemagglutination (HA). The presence of both types of autoantibodies showed positive heritability in patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis (TT), but it was not observed in chronic lymphocytic or Hashimoto's thyroiditis (CLT) patients. Since these assays have been extensively used over the years by most diagnostic and research laboratories, they should provide some insight as to which quantifiable parameters may be usefully accumulated to help select groups of patients and their families for further genetic study. ROMP may also be useful to determine the sequential appearance of different types of antibody in predicting disease onset in other family members, and in distinguishing maternal and paternal effects on imprinting. The method may be extended to study epitope spreading and other measures of disease progression.",M2
17584828,"Mifepristone induced progesterone withdrawal reveals novel regulatory pathways in human endometrium.In women, a single dose of the antiprogestin mifepristone (RU486) in the secretory phase rapidly renders the endometrium unreceptive and is followed by endometrial breakdown and menstruation within 72 h. This model provides a system to identify progesterone-regulated genes, which may be involved in endometrial receptivity and the induction of menstruation. We used cDNA microarrays to monitor the response of the endometriuim over 24 h following administration of mifepristone in the mid-secretory phase. We identified 571 transcripts whose expression was significantly altered, representing 131 biochemical pathways. These include new progesterone regulated members of the Wnt, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), prostaglandin (PG) and chemokine regulatory pathways. Transcripts involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and signalling such as type II iodothyronine deiodinase and thyroid receptors were also found to be highly regulated by progesterone antagonism in the endometrium. Transcripts required for thyroid hormone synthesis such as thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) and thyroglobulin (TG) were also expressed, indicating that the endometrium may be a site of thyroxin production. These results add to the existing knowledge of the role of the Wnt, chemokine, MMP and PG pathways in receptivity and early menstrual events. They provide in vivo evidence supporting direct or indirect regulation of many new transcripts by progesterone. We have also identified for the first time the very early transcriptional changes in vivo in response to progesterone withdrawal. This greatly increases our understanding of the pathways leading to menstruation and may provide new approaches to diagnose and treat menstrual disorders.",M2
17578823,"Organ specific autoantibodies in preclinical and early clinical type 1 diabetes in Turkey.Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients (G1; n=73) and first degree relatives with islet cell antibody (ICA) values of &gt;or=10 JDF u twice or &gt;or=20 JDF u one and loss of FPIR (G2; n=18) were screened for two other autoantibodies, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and for other organ-specific autoantibodies, anti-gastric parietal cell (anti-PCA) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-<e>TPO</e>) as well. The two control groups consisted of healthy subjects (G3; n:55 and G4; n:13). In G1, positivity of ICA, GADA, IAA, anti-TPO and anti-PCA were 63%, 75.1%, 27.4%, 17.8% and 8.2%, respectively. In G2, positivity for GADA, IAA, anti-TPO and anti-PCA were 55.6%, 11.1%, 16.7% and 11.1%, respectively. None of the anti-TPO or anti-PCA positive cases had clinical or laboratory thyroid disease or pernicious anemia. Other organ specific antibodies, in case they accompany GADAand/or IAA in high risk individuals, result in higher risk for T1D. Moreover, this condition may indicate future potential for developing thyrogastric autoimmune diseases. In conclusion; autoantibodies are markers for autoimmune destruction in T1D, and for identification of subjects at risk for disease. Even at the time of diagnosis of T1D, screening for thyrogastric autoimmunity might be recommended for early detection of the relevant diseases.",M2
17547680,"Two compound heterozygous mutations (c.215delA/c.2422T--&gt;C and c.387delC/c.1159G--&gt;A) in the thyroid peroxidase gene responsible for congenital goitre and iodide organification defect.BACKGROUND: Iodide organification defects are frequently but not always associated with mutations in the thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) gene and characterized by a positive perchlorate discharge test. These mutations phenotypically produce a congenital goitrous hypothyroidism, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. OBJECTIVES: In the present study we extended our initial molecular studies in six unrelated patients heterozygous for the TPO mutations, in order to identify the second mutation in this autosomal recessive disease. METHODS: The promoter and the complete coding regions of the human TPO and DUOXA2 genes, along with the flanking regions of each intron were analysed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Four different inactivating TPO mutations were identified in two patients: two novel mutations (c.215delA [p.Q72fsX86] and c.1159G--&gt;A [p.G387R]) and two previously reported (c.387delC [p.N129fsX208] and c.2422T--&gt;C [p.C808R]), confirming the inheritance of two different compound heterozygous mutations, c.215delA/c.2422T--&gt;C and c.387delC/c.1159G--&gt;A. The remaining four patients did not show additional inactivating mutations in the TPO gene and all had only the wild type sequencing in the DUOXA2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: We have reported two patients with iodide organification defect caused by two compound heterozygous mutations, c.215delA/c.2422T--&gt;C [p.Q72fsX86/p.C808R] and c.387delC/c.1159G--&gt;A [p.N129fsX208/p.G387R], in the TPO gene and four patients with monoallelic TPO defect. Identification of the molecular basis of this disorder might be helpful for understanding the pathophysiology of congenital hypothyroidism.",M2
17531186,"[Steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with auto-immune thyroiditis]Since the first description of encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1966, more than 100 cases of this entity called Hashimoto's encephalopathy or SREAT [steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with auto-immune thyroiditis] have been reported. The two cases reported here illustrate different diagnostic criteria and offer the opportunity to discuss the many pathophysiological hypotheses based on particularly pertinent biological data, especially the activity of anti-<e>TPO</e> and anti-TG antibodies present in serum and cerebrospinal fluid and the recent discovery of anti-alpha-enolase antibody. Different treatment options are also discussed, in particular corticosteroid therapy.",M2
17482640,"A radioligand binding assay to measure anti-thyroperoxidase autoantibodies in mice.Autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis is a chronic inflammatory disease which affects &gt;3% of the population and shows an increasing prevalence with increasing age. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies, particularly against thyroperoxidase (also known as thyroid peroxidase or <e>TPO</e>), occur commonly in humans with autoimmune thyroid disease, and assays for anti-TPO autoantibodies are used in clinical diagnosis. In contrast anti-TPO autoantibodies have not been observed in classical mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis, except in cases where mice were deliberately immunized with TPO. In the past, detection of anti-TPO autoantibodies in mice has relied on an indirect immunofluorescence assay (iIFA) which screens for thyroid follicle membrane staining in frozen sections of mouse thyroid glands. Since recent transgenic mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis spontaneously develop anti-TPO autoantibodies, an assay other than serial dilution and iIFA would be useful to detect and quantify these autoantibodies. In this paper we describe such an assay, based on the capacity of autoimmune mouse sera to bind to the extracellular domain of mouse TPO which was produced in a radioactively labeled form using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. The same approach, using human TPO, could provide a highly sensitive method to detect anti-TPO autoantibodies in humans.",M2
17468186,"High prevalence of thyroid peroxidase gene mutations in patients with thyroid dyshormonogenesis.OBJECTIVE: Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited disorders in the enzymatic cascade of thyroid hormone synthesis that result in congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Thyroid peroxidase gene (<e>TPO</e>) mutations are one of the most common causes of thyroid dyshormonogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify TPO gene defects in a cohort of patients with thyroid dyshormonogenesis from Slovenia, Bosnia, and Slovakia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with permanent CH and orthoptic thyroid glands from 39 unrelated families participated in the study. Mutational analysis of the TPO gene and part of its promoter consisted of single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis, sequencing, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: TPO gene mutations were identified in 46% of participants. Seven different mutations were identified, four mutations of these being novel, namely 613C &gt; T (R175X), 1519_1539del (A477_N483del), 2089G &gt; A (G667S), and 2669G &gt; A (G860R). Only a single allele mutation was identified in 65% of the TPO mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a higher prevalence of TPO gene mutations in thyroid dyshormonogenesis when compared with published studies. The high percentage of single allele mutations implied possible intronic or regulatory TPO gene mutations or monoallelic expression.",M2
17447660,"Sample commutability in external quality assessment surveys (EQAS) for thyroid-related antibodies--state of the art.External quality assessment surveys for thyroid-related antibodies have been offered by INSTAND for 20 years. During this time, some problems have remained, especially those between the similarity of samples sent and routine patient samples. Here the questions of  matrix effects  and  commutability of results  are topics discussed at most EQA-meetings. This short communication deals with the effects of lyophilization on results for thyroid-associated antibodies in an EQA-survey carried out by over 230 participants in October 2005 by INSTAND in Düsseldorf, Germany. The results show that there are small but statistically significant differences (at the level p &lt; 0.05) in results from liquid and lyophilized samples from the same source, the tendency to higher results in the lyophilized samples for anti-<e>TPO</e> and anti-Tg and to lower results for TRAb. The precision in measurement was significantly better for anti-TPO and TRAb in the lyophilized samples, there being no significant difference for anti-Tg. The differences in results between liquid and lyophilized samples were minimal when compared with the numerical results for anti-TPO and anti-Tg, despite the fact that all kits were calibrated with the NIBSC reference materials, although the latter are now both 40 years old.",M2
17400807,"Overexpression of Wnt-1 in thyrocytes enhances cellular growth but suppresses transcription of the thyroperoxidase gene via different signaling mechanisms.Wnt binding to cell surface receptors can activate a 'canonical' pathway that increases cellular beta-catenin or a 'noncanonical' Ca(++) pathway which can increase protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Although components of both Wnt/beta-catenin-signaling pathways exist in thyrocytes, their biological role is largely unknown. In evaluating the biological role of Wnt signaling in differentiated FRTL-5 thyroid cells, we showed that TSH increased canonical Wnt-1 but, surprisingly, decreased the active form of beta-catenin. Transient overexpression of Wnt-1 or beta-catenin in FRTL-5 cells increased active beta-catenin (ABC), decreased thyroperoxidase (<e>TPO</e>) mRNA, and suppressed TPO-promoter activity. The target of beta-catenin suppressive action was a consensus T cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF)-binding site 5'-A/T A/T CAAAG-3', -137 to -129 bp on the rat TPO promoter. beta-Catenin overexpression significantly increased complex formation between beta-catenin/TCF-1 and an oligonucleotide containing the TCF/LEF sequence, suggesting that the beta-catenin/TCF-1 complex acts as a transcriptional repressor of the TPO gene. Stable over-expression of Wnt-1 in FRTL-5 cells significantly increased the growth rate without increasing beta-catenin levels. Increased growth was blunted by a PKC inhibitor, staurosporin. Wnt-1 overexpression increased serine phosphorylation, without affecting tyrosine phosphorylation, of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein. In addition, these final results suggest that TSH-induced increase in Wnt-1 levels in thyrocytes contributes to enhanced cellular growth via a PKC pathway that increases STAT3 serine phosphorylation and activation, whereas TSH-induced decrease in activation of beta-catenin simultaneously relieves transcriptional suppression of TPO. We hypothesize that Wnt signaling contributes to the ability of TSH to simultaneously increase cell growth and functional, thyroid-specific, gene expression.",M2
17505148,"Possible reasons for different pattern disappearance of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma following total thyroidectomy and iodine-131 ablation.The purpose of this study was to reveal some possible factors for the differences between the pattern of disappearance of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (anti-<e>TPO</e>) in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma following thyroidectomy and iodine-131 ablation. Patients with a history of follicular cell derived cancer (papillary, follicular, both papillary and follicular, Hürthle cell) and high pre-operative titers of anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg autoantibodies were retrospectively studied. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels were measured using radio-immunometric assay (RIA). Anti-Tg and anti-TPO levels during the first 6 yr' follow-up were measured by passive agglutination, during the following 10 yr by ELISA method and during the last 2 yr by chemiluminescence assay. A statistically significant difference was observed between median time (72 months) of disappearance of anti-TPO and median time (39 months) of disappearance of anti-Tg in patients with complete ablation of thyroid tissue, following iodine-131 administration (p=0.0395, Logrank statistic=4.24, Kaplan-Meier method). A statistically significant difference was observed between median time (106 months) of disappearance of anti-TPO and median time (33 months) of disappearance of anti-Tg in patients &gt;45 yr of age (p=0.034) and between median time (111 months) of disappearance of anti-TPO and median time (41 months) of disappearance of anti-Tg in patients with tumor size &lt;2 cm (p=0.0175). We concluded that patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and pre-surgical elevated titers of both Tg and anti-TPO tend to become earlier anti-Tg seronegative. Although tumor size and age may influence the pattern of thyroid autoantibody reduction, the exact reasons for the different rhythm of autoantibodies decrease must further be evaluated.",M2
17504869,"Clinical significance of diffusely increased 18F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland.Our purpose was to determine the clinical significance of diffusely increased (18)F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland as an incidental finding on PET/CT. METHODS: All patients who were found to have diffuse thyroid uptake on (18)F-FDG PET/CT in our institution between November 2004 and June 2006 were investigated and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. The (18)F-FDG uptake in the thyroid was semiquantified using maximum standardized uptake value and correlated to the available serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid peroxidase (<e>TPO</e>) antibody levels using regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 4,732 patients, 138 (2.9%) had diffuse thyroid uptake. Clinical information was available for 133 of the 138 patients. Sixty-three (47.4%) had a prior diagnosis of hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroiditis, of whom 56 were receiving thyroxine therapy. In the control group, consisting of 133 patients with no thyroid uptake, there were 13 (9.8%) with a prior diagnosis of hypothyroidism, 11 of whom were receiving thyroxine therapy. In the study group, 38 (28.6%) of 133 patients did not undergo any further investigation for thyroid disease, whereas 32 (24.1%) of 133 patients were examined for thyroid disease after PET. Nineteen were found with autoimmune thyroiditis or hypothyroidism, and replacement therapy was initiated in 12. No significant correlation was found between maximum standardized uptake value and TSH (P = 0.09) or TPO antibody (P = 0.68) levels. CONCLUSION: The incidental finding of increased (18)F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland is associated with chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis and does not seem to be affected by thyroid hormone therapy. SUV correlated neither with the degree of hypothyroidism nor with the titer of TPO antibodies.",M2
