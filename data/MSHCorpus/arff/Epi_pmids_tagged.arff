20229679,"Changes in platelets and anticoagulant protein activity during adenosine-exercise single-photon emission computed tomography stress test.INTRODUCTION: Activation of haemostasis during physical stress or during myocardial ischemia could be an important mechanism to trigger coronary and stent thrombosis. We examined changes in haemostatic parameters and its association with myocardial ischemia during adenosine-exercise-SPECT (adeno-EX) stress test in coronary patients at least 4 months after coronary stenting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine relationship between changes in haemostatic parameters and stress induced myocardial ischemia quantified by perfusion scintigraphy in stented coronary patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (26 on clopidogrel plus aspirin and 11 on aspirin only) 4-8 months after successful intracoronary stent implantation were enrolled in the study. We determined the levels of platelet aggregability (PA) on ADP (PA-ADP) and epinephrine (PA-<e>EPI</e>), beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor-4, protein C (PC) and antithrombin (AT) before and 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 150 micro/kg adenosine for4 minutes concomitant with supine ergo-bicycle exercise test for 50 W. The size of stress perfusion defect was measured 15 minutes after stress and in rest 4 hours later by 99mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) within 17 myocardial segments. RESULTS: There were no differences between haemostatic parameters before and after stress. A significant myocardial ischemia after exercise was registered in 12 patients on combined antiaggregation therapy and in 5 patients on aspirin. In this preliminary report, because of a small number of patients in the aspirin group we did not analyse difference in the levels of haemostatic markers and their correlations with the size of perfusion defect. The only significant difference between measured haemostatic parameters in the patients with stress induced ischemia compared to the patients without it, was a lower level of AT activity after stress (81.0% vs. 87.5%; p = 0.027). Antithrombin activity before stress had significant negative correlation with the size of perfusion defect in rest (R2 = 0.219; p = 0.016) and PC activity before stress had significant linear correlation with stress perfusion defect (R2 = 0.248; p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Baseline activities of natural anticoagulant proteins AT and PC are associated with the size of myocardial perfusion defect during adeno-EX-SPECT test. Patients with significant stress-induced ischemia had lower levels of AT activity after stress.",M1

20070242,"Pharmacokinetic and local toxicity studies of liposome-encapsulated and plain mepivacaine solutions in rats.The pharmacokinetics and the local toxicity of commercial and liposome-encapsulated mepivacaine formulations injected intra-orally in rats were studied. Animals were divided in groups (n = 4-6) and treated with 0.1 mL of the formulations: 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (MVC(2%<e>EPI</e>)), 3% mepivacaine (MVC(3%)), and 2% liposome-encapsulated mepivacaine (MVC(LUV)). The results showed that the 2% liposome-encapsulated mepivacaine reduced C(max), prolonged AUC(0-infinity) and t(1/2) compared with 3% plain and 2% vasoconstritor-associated mepivacaine, after intraoral injection. In addition, it was also observed that liposomal mepivacaine might protect the tissue against local inflammation evoked by plain or vasoconstrictors-associated mepivacaine, giving supporting evidence for its safety and possible clinical use in dentistry.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Japanese White tracheotomized rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane. Three doses of 0.18, 0.36, and 0.72 mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride containing 1:80,000 Epi or 3% prilocaine hydrochloride containing Fely 0.03 IU/mL were injected into the rabbit tongue muscle. These doses were equivalent to 2, 4, and 8 of dental local anesthetic cartridges in humans weighing 50 kg by body weight correction, respectively. Heart rate, blood pressure, aortic blood flow, myocardial tissue blood flow, and myocardial tissue oxygen tension were continuously monitored. Data were recorded immediately before and 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes after the injection. RESULTS: Heart rate decreased in the Fely group. Systolic blood pressure increased in the Epi group, and diastolic blood pressure increased in both groups. Aortic blood flow and myocardial tissue blood flow increased, whereas myocardial tissue oxygen tension did not change in the Epi group. In contrast, aortic blood flow, myocardial tissue blood flow, and myocardial tissue oxygen tension decreased in the Fely group. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that Fely, but not Epi, decreases myocardial oxygen tension and aggravates myocardial oxygen demand/supply balance even after an injection of dental local anesthetic solution at routine doses.",M1
19923980,"Impact of genetic polymorphisms on platelet function and aspirin resistance.Genetic polymorphisms may affect platelets' responses to the antiplatelet therapy. Our aim was to determine the role of genetic polymorphisms on aspirin resistance in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 126 consecutive patients (35-85 years old, 32% women) with chronic stable CHD was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/<e>Epi</e>) and collagen and adenosine diphosphate (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time of less than 186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. Factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1), glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms were determined by three consecutive steps: isolation and amplification of DNA and reverse hybridization. We determined that 30 patients (23.8%) had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 74 +/- 12 s (51-104 s). Ten of the 30 patients with aspirin resistance were women (33.3%). Genetic polymorphisms were determined in 30 aspirin-resistant and 17 aspirin-sensitive patients. No statistically significant relationship was determined between aspirin resistance and the genetic panel. In our study we did not determine a significant relationship between the aspirin resistance and factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, PAI-1, glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms.",M1
19788899,"Standard object recognition memory and  what  and  where  components: Improvement by post-training epinephrine in highly habituated rats.The present work examined whether post-training systemic epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) is able to modulate short-term (3h) and long-term (24 h and 48 h) memory of standard object recognition, as well as long-term (24 h) memory of separate  what  (object identity) and  where  (object location) components of object recognition. Although object recognition training is associated to low arousal levels, all the animals received habituation to the training box in order to further reduce emotional arousal. Post-training EPI improved long-term (24 h and 48 h), but not short-term (3 h), memory in the standard object recognition task, as well as 24 h memory for both object identity and object location. These data indicate that post-training epinephrine: (1) facilitates long-term memory for standard object recognition; (2) exerts separate facilitatory effects on  what  (object identity) and  where  (object location) components of object recognition; and (3) is capable of improving memory for a low arousing task even in highly habituated rats.",M1
19664643,"Modification of endothelial biology by acute and chronic stress hormones.OBJECTIVE: An increasing number of studies have examined the role of emotional stress and coronary heart disease; the underlying pathophysiology is still poorly understood. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between acute (<e>epi</e>- and norepinephrine) and chronic stress hormones (dexamethasone, beta-endorphin, corticotropin releasing hormone) and endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Human microvascular endothelial cells were incubated with stress hormones for 6 and 24 h. ET-1 release and ADMA were quantified via ELISA, NO release by using cell permeable 4.5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF2-DA), oxidative stress fluometrically by the ROS-sensitive carboxy-H2-DCFDA method, mitochondrial metabolic activity by using the colorimetric assay WST-1, ET-1 receptor type A (ET(A)R) protein expression by Western blot, and cell proliferation activity was assessed by the colorimetric assay BrdU. RESULTS: With respect to analysed acute and chronic stress hormones, ET-1 release was significantly increased. Likewise, protein expression was enhanced after long term incubation (24 h) with norepinephrine and dexamethasone. In contrast, endothelial NO-levels were only influenced by short term stimulation of dexamethasone (upregulation of NO release) and norepinephrine (downregulation of NO release), whereas modified NO concentration mimics altered mitochondrial metabolic activity. Unexpectedly, both oxidative stress and cell proliferation were not modified by stress hormones. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that acute and chronic stress hormones induce a significant ET-1 release whereas NO release remained mainly unchanged. The imbalance of pro- and antiatherosclerotic factors may play a pivotal role in the initiation of stress-related endothelial dysfunction up to myocardial infarction.",M1
19656409,"Effect of the dietary supplement Meltdown on catecholamine secretion, markers of lipolysis, and metabolic rate in men and women: a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over study.BACKGROUND: We have recently reported that the dietary supplement Meltdown increases plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), glycerol, free fatty acids (FFA), and metabolic rate in men. However, in that investigation measurements ceased at 90 minutes post ingestion, with values for blood borne variables peaking at this time. It was the purpose of the present investigation to extend the time course of measurement to 6 hours, and to include women within the design to determine if sex differences to treatment exist. METHODS: Ten men (24 +/- 4 yrs) and 10 women (22 +/- 2 yrs) ingested Meltdown or a placebo, using a randomized, cross-over design with one week separating conditions. Blood samples were collected immediately before supplementation and at one hour intervals through 6 hours post ingestion. A standard meal was provided after the hour 3 collection. Samples were assayed for EPI, NE, glycerol, and FFA. Five minute breath samples were collected at each time for measurement of metabolic rate and substrate utilization. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all times. Data were also analyzed using a 2 (sex) x 2 (condition) x 7 (time) repeated measures analysis of variance, with Tukey post hoc testing. RESULTS: No sex x condition interactions were noted for AUC for any variable (p &gt; 0.05). Hence, AUC data are collapsed across men and women. AUC was greater for Meltdown compared to placebo for EPI (367 +/- 58 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 183 +/- 27 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.01), NE (2345 +/- 205 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 1659 +/- 184 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.02), glycerol (79 +/- 8 microg x mL)-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 59 +/- 6 microg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.03), FFA (2.46 +/- 0.64 mmol x L(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 1.57 +/- 0.42 mmol x L(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.05), and kilocalorie expenditure (439 +/- 26 kcal x 6 hrs(-1) vs. 380 +/- 14 kcal x 6 hrs(-1); p = 0.02). No effect was noted for substrate utilization (p = 0.39). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p &lt; 0.0001; 1-16 mmHg), as well as heart rate (p = 0.01; 1-9 bpm) were higher for Meltdown. No sex x condition x time interactions were noted for any variable (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ingestion of Meltdown results in an increase in catecholamine secretion, lipolysis, and metabolic rate in young men and women, with a similar response for both sexes. Meltdown may prove to be an effective intervention strategy for fat loss, assuming individuals are normotensive and their treatment is monitored by a qualified health care professional.",M1
19542503,"Interrelationships among growth, endocrine, immune, and temperament variables in neonatal Brahman calves.Interrelationships among growth, endocrine, immune, and temperament variables were assessed in neonatal Brahman calves. The velocity upon exiting a working chute (exit velocity) of an animal was measured and used as an objective indicator of temperament to classify calves as calm, intermediate, or temperamental. Calves (n = 116) were weighed weekly between d 0 and 21 to 24, and blood samples were collected for plasma and serum on d 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 to 24 after birth to measure concentrations of immunoglobulins, cortisol, and epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>). Body weight increased from d 0 through d 21 to 24 (P &lt; 0.001) with bulls (n = 60) having greater BW than heifers (n = 56; P = 0.02). Serum concentrations of cortisol were greatest on d 0 before declining (P &lt; 0.001) over the ensuing 21 to 24 d and were not related to temperament (P = 0.89) or sex (P = 0.97). Concentrations of EPI were affected by time, with an increase in EPI concentrations in temperamental bulls between 2 and 14 d of age (P &lt; 0.008). Concentrations of EPI were not affected by temperament (P = 0.44) or sex (P = 0.68). Serum immunoglobulin concentrations peaked on d 1 before declining (P &lt; 0.01) but were not related to temperament (P = 0.40 to 0.68). Of the stress hormones measured (cortisol and EPI), only cortisol was associated with the early performance of the calf. Calf BW at d 21 to 24 and BW gain were positively associated with serum immunoglobulin concentrations, yet negatively associated with concentrations of cortisol. Serum immunoglobulin concentrations were negatively correlated with cortisol concentrations (r = -0.28; P = 0.003), yet positively associated with EPI concentrations (r = 0.51; P = 0.003). During the neonatal period in this study, there was no relationship of temperament with passive immunity or stress hormone concentrations; however, growth was positively associated with passive immunity and negatively associated with stress hormones. Measuring exit velocity as early in life as d 21 to 24 fails to accurately predict temperament at weaning in over 40% of Brahman calves. Our conclusion is that measurement of exit velocity should be done nearer to the time of weaning than to birth. These data can be beneficial in developing best management practices for young calves.",M1
19497958,"Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in guinea pig distal colonic epithelium: desensitization via the Y2-neuropeptide receptor.Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in isolated mucosa from guinea pig distal colon was desensitized by peptide-YY (PYY). Addition of PYY or neuropeptide-Y (NPY) to the bathing solution of mucosae in Ussing chambers suppressed the short-circuit current (Isc) corresponding to electrogenic Cl- secretion, whether stimulated by epinephrine (<e>epi</e>), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), or carbachol (CCh). Neither peptide markedly inhibited the large transient component of synergistic secretion (PGE2 + CCh). Sustained Cl- secretory Isc was inhibited approximately 65% by PYY or NPY, with IC50s of 4.1 +/- 0.9 nM and 9.4 +/- 3.8 nM, respectively. This inhibition was eliminated by BIIE0246, an antagonist of the Y2-neuropeptide receptor (Y2-NpR), but not by Y1-NpR antagonist BVD10. Adrenergic sensitivity for activation of K+ secretion in the presence of Y2-NpR blockade by BIIE0246 was (EC50s) 2.9 +/- 1.2 nM for epi and 13.3 +/- 1.0 nM for norepinephrine, approximately fourfold greater than in the presence of PYY. Expression of mRNA for both Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was indicated by RT-PCR of RNA from colonic mucosa, and protein expression was indicated by immunoblot. Immunoreactivity (ir) for Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was distinct in basolateral membranes of columnar epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn as well as intercrypt surface epithelium. Adrenergic nerves in proximity with crypts were detected by ir for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and a portion of these nerves also contained NPY(ir). BIIE0246 addition increased secretagog-activated Isc, consistent with in vitro release of either PYY or NPY. Thus PYY and NPY were able to suppress Cl- secretory capacity and desensitize the adrenergic K+ secretory response, providing a direct inhibitory counterbalance against secretory activation.",M1
19460844,"Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in guinea pig distal colonic epithelium: involvement of beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors.Adrenergic stimulation of electrogenic K+ secretion in isolated mucosa from guinea pig distal colon required activation of two beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta-AdrR). Addition of epinephrine (<e>epi</e>) or norepinephrine (norepi) to the bathing solution of mucosae in Ussing chambers increased short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial conductance (Gt), consistent with this cation secretion. A beta-adrenergic classification was supported by propranolol antagonism of this secretory response and the lack of effect by the alpha-AdrR antagonists BE2254 (alpha1-AdrR) and yohimbine (alpha2-AdrR). Subtype-selective antagonists CGP20712A (beta1-AdrR), ICI-118551 (beta2-AdrR), and SR59320A (beta3-AdrR) were relatively ineffective at inhibiting the epi-stimulated Isc response. In combination, CGP20712A and ICI-118551 inhibited the response, which supported a synergistic action by beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR. Expression of mRNA for both beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR was indicated by RT-PCR of RNA from colonic epithelial cells. Protein expression was indicated by immunoblot showing bands at molecular weights consistent with monomers and oligomers. Immunoreactivity (ir) for beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR was prominent in basolateral membranes of columnar epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn as well as intercrypt surface epithelium. Cells in the pericryptal sheath also had beta1-AdrR(ir) but did not have discernable beta2-AdrR(ir). The adrenergic sensitivity of K+ secretion measured by Isc and Gt was relatively low as indicated by EC(50)s of 41 +/- 7 nM for epi and 50 +/- 14 nM for norepi. Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion required the involvement of both beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR, occurring with an agonist sensitivity reduced compared with reported values for either receptor subtype.",M1
19444233,"Beta-adrenergic-AMPK pathway phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase in a high-epinephrine rat model, SPORTS.We established a new animal model called SPORTS (Spontaneously-Running Tokushima-Shikoku) rats, which show high-epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) levels. Recent reports show that Epi activates adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, and the enzymatic activity is suppressed when its Ser-79 is phosphorylated by AMPK. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of Epi on ACC and abdominal visceral fat accumulation. We divided both 6-week male control and SPORTS rats into two groups, which were fed either normal diet or high fat and sucrose (HFS) diet for 16 weeks. At the end of diet treatment, retroperitoneal fat was collected for western blotting and histological analysis. Food intake was not different among the groups, but SPORTS rats showed significantly lower weight gain than control rats in both diet groups. After 10 weeks of diet treatment, glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) revealed that SPORTS rats had increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, SPORTS rats had lower quantities of both abdominal fat and plasma triglyceride (TG). In abdominal fat, elevated ACC Ser-79 phosphorylation was observed in SPORTS rats and suppressed by an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptor (AR), propranolol, or an inhibitor of AMPK, Compound C. From these results, high level of Epi induced ACC phosphorylation mediated through beta-AR and AMPK signaling pathways in abdominal visceral fat of SPORTS rats, which may contribute to reduce abdominal visceral fat accumulation and increase insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest that beta-AR-regulated ACC activity would be a target for treating lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity.",M1
19436444,"The behavioral assessment and alleviation of pain associated with castration in beef calves treated with flunixin meglumine and caudal lidocaine epidural anesthesia with epinephrine.The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the effects of flunixin megulmine in combination with caudal epidural anesthesia as a postoperative analgesic in beef calves following surgical castration, and 2) to consider stride length and pedometry as potential behavioral assessment tools for detecting postcastration pain. Surgical castration was performed in 101 beef calves randomly assigned to 3 treatment subgroups: 1) castration without anesthesia (SURG); 2) castration following lidocaine with epinephrine caudal epidural anesthesia (SURG + <e>EPI</e>); 3) castration following lidocaine with epinephrine caudal epidural anesthesia and flunixin meglumine (SURG + EPI + F). Several outcomes, including pedometer counts, changes in stride length, subjective visual assessment of pain, instantaneous scan sampling of the calves' postoperative activities, and the amount of movement and vocalization during the castration procedure, were measured to identify and quantify pain. The results indicated that stride length and the number of steps taken by calves after castration appear to be good measures of pain. Significant differences found between treatment groups for stride length and visual assessments suggest that flunixin meglumine can be considered to provide visible pain relief up to 8 hours postcastration.",M1
19411061,"Adrenergic dysregulation and pain with and without acute beta-blockade in women with fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorder.In patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), stress and pain may chronically enhance sympathetic activity, altering cardiovascular responses and worsening pain. This study examined cardiovascular, epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol and clinical pain responses in 54 female patients with these disorders and 34 controls. In a subsample of 10 FMS, 10 TMD patients and 16 controls, using a counterbalanced, double-blind, crossover design, the same responses were assessed after intravenous administration of low dose propranolol vs placebo. Testing included baseline, postural, speech and ischemic pain stressors. FMS patients showed lesser heart rate (HR) increases to posture challenge but greater blood pressure (BP) increases to postural and speech tasks than controls, as well as higher overall BP and greater total vascular resistance (TVR) than TMDs or controls. TMDs showed higher overall cardiac output and lower TVR than controls. Both FMS and TMD groups showed lower baseline NE than controls, and TMDs showed lower overall EPI and NE levels. Group differences in HR, EPI and NE were abolished after propranolol although BP, CO and TVR differences persisted. In both FMS and TMD, the number of painful body sites and ratings of total clinical pain obtained 4 times during each session were significantly lower after beta-blockade vs placebo. PERSPECTIVE: These findings support the hypothesis that both FMS and TMD may frequently involve dysregulation of beta-adrenergic activity that contributes to altered cardiovascular and catecholamine responses and to severity of clinical pain. Acute treatment with low-dose propranolol led to short-term improvement in all these domains.",M1
19407251,"Greater systemic lipolysis in women compared with men during moderate-dose infusion of epinephrine and/or norepinephrine.Women have lower circulating catecholamine levels during metabolic perturbations, such as exercise or hypoglycemia, but similar rates of systemic lipolysis. This suggests women may be more sensitive to the lipolytic action of catecholamines, while maintaining similar glucoregulatory effects. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether women have higher rates of systemic lipolysis compared with men in response to matched peripheral infusion of catecholamines, but similar rates of glucose turnover. Healthy, nonobese women (n = 11) and men (n = 10) were recruited and studied on 3 separate days with the following infusions: epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>), norepinephrine (NE), or the two combined. Tracer infusions of glycerol and glucose were used to determine systemic lipolysis and glucose turnover, respectively. Following basal measurements of substrate kinetics, the catecholamine infusion commenced, and measures of substrate kinetics continued for 60 min. Catecholamine concentrations were similarly elevated in women and men during each infusion: Epi, 182-197 pg/ml and NE, 417-507 pg/ml. There was a significant sex difference in glycerol rate of appearance and rate of disappearance with the catecholamine infusions (P &lt; 0.0001), mainly due to a significantly greater glycerol turnover during the first 30 min of each infusion: glycerol rate of appearance during Epi was only 268 +/- 18 vs. 206 +/- 21 micromol/min in women and men, respectively; during NE, only 173 +/- 13 vs. 153 +/- 17 micromol/min, and during Epi+NE, 303 +/- 24 vs. 257 +/- 21 micromol/min. No sex differences were observed in glucose kinetics under any condition. In conclusion, these data suggest that women are more sensitive to the lipolytic action of catecholamines, but have no difference in their glucoregulatory response. Thus the lower catcholamine levels observed in women vs. men during exercise and other metabolic perturbations may allow women to maintain a similar or greater level of lipid mobilization while minimizing changes in glucose turnover.",M1
19387330,"Influence of acute epinephrine infusion on endotoxin-induced parameters of heart rate variability: a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the acute anti-inflammatory influence of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) extends to changes in heart rate variability (HRV) induced by the prototypical inflammatory stimulus, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: HRV reflects fluctuating cardiac autonomic inputs and is acutely reduced during the systemic inflammation induced by LPS as well as during severe critical illnesses such as sepsis and traumatic injury. While EPI may diminish proinflammatory cytokine release, it is unknown whether this net anti-inflammatory activity extends to HRV. METHODS: Healthy volunteers (n = 17) were randomized to either saline + LPS (2 ng/kg) or LPS + antecedent EPI infusion (30 ng/kg/min) from -3 to 6 hours relative to LPS. HRV and blood samples were obtained before EPI and LPS as well as hourly afterward. Plasma cytokines were measured by ELISA. Statistical analysis was by repeated measures analysis of variance. This study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov and is listed under the following ID number: NCT00753402. RESULTS: LPS acutely influenced all measured parameters of HRV including standard deviation of the average beat to beat intervals over a 5-minute period, percentage of interval differences of successive interbeat intervals greater than 50 milliseconds and square root of the mean squared differences, high frequency (HF), low frequency, low frequency/HF, and very low frequency (all P &lt; 0.01). EPI infusion reduced the inflammatory cytokine response to LPS as measured by decreased TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-8 (P &lt; 0.01). Relative to the saline + LPS group, antecedent EPI infusion was associated with further reductions in parameters of HRV measuring vagal/parasympathetic activity including, percentage of interval differences of successive interbeat intervals greater than 50 milliseconds, square root of the mean squared differences, and HF (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prior EPI exposure exerts anti-inflammatory influences but also may reduce vagus nerve activity. Hence, acute EPI administration may be protective against early inflammatory challenges but diminish vagal nerve responsiveness to subsequent stimuli.",M1
19378908,"Catecholamine levels in hypoxia-lnduced acute mountain sickness.Enhanced sympathoadrenal activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute mountain sickness (AMS). This study was designed to examine the time course of circulating catecholamines in individuals with and without AMS. METHODS: Subjects were low-altitude residents (10 men, 8 women) who had not been exposed to altitude within the previous 2 mo. They breathed 12% O2 (hypoxia equivalent to 4600 m altitude) for 8 h while seated at rest. AMS was evaluated using Lake Louise scores (LLS) at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 h of exposure using a threshold of 3 to define AMS. Blood samples were collected to measure arterial blood gases and oxygen saturation as well as arterial and venous epinephrine (A-<e>EPI</e> and V-EPI) and norepinephrine (A-NE and V-NE). RESULTS: Eight subjects (44%) developed AMS at some time during the experiment. Blood gases showed no significant difference between subjects with or without symptoms (AMS+ and AMS-, respectively). However, AMS+ subjects showed significantly greater concentrations of A-EPI over the 8 h without any between-group difference in V-EPI. Levels of A-NE were significantly higher at baseline and during the first hour of hypoxia in subjects who later developed AMS. V-NE increased significantly over time among all participants with no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a possible physiological marker for individuals who may be relatively susceptible to AMS and provide additional insight into the sympathoadrenal response to acute hypoxia.",M1
19370475,"ErbB receptors protect the perfused heart against injury induced by epinephrine combined with low-flow ischemia.ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases are important in maintaining the long-term structural integrity of the heart and in the induction of hypertrophy. In addition, in vivo activation of ErbB1 by epidermal growth factor (EGF) protects the heart against acute stress-induced damage. We examined here whether the ErbB sytem acutely protects the isolated heart in which stress was induced in vitro by ischemia combined with epinephrine infusion (<e>EPI</e>). In perfused mouse hearts, EGF induced Tyr-phosphorylation of ErbB1 but not ErbB2. Neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta) induced Tyr-phosphorylation of both ErbB4 and ErbB2. We also found differences in the signaling cascades activated by each growth factor. To stress the perfused mouse heart, we combined EPI with low-flow ischemia. This resulted in (i) loss of left ventricle contraction force ( + dP/dt(max)) and developed pressure (LVDP) after a short period of hypercontractility, (ii) enhanced anaerobic metabolism (lactate production), and (iii) myocyte injury (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release). EGF and NRG-1beta had different effects on stressed-heart contractility. EGF reduced to a half the loss of both + dP/dt(max) and LVDP. In contrast, NRG-1beta exacerbated the hypercontractility soon after reperfusion. This is coincident with a transient increase in coronary flow after reperfusion. In spite of these differences in contraction, both EGF and NRG-1beta induced similar early protection as shown by the reduction of LDH release. Our results show that the ErbB system protects the perfused heart against damage induced by acute stress. They reinforce the relevance of ErbB receptors and ligands in cardiac physiology.",M1
19289831,"The two-component system QseEF and the membrane protein QseG link adrenergic and stress sensing to bacterial pathogenesis.Bacterial pathogens sense host cues to activate expression of virulence genes. Most of these signals are sensed through histidine kinases (HKs), which comprise the main sensory mechanism in bacteria. The host stress hormones epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) and norepinephrine are sensed through the QseC HK, which initiates a complex signaling cascade to regulate virulence gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Epi signaling through QseC activates expression of the genes encoding the QseEF 2-component system. QseE is an HK, and QseF is a response regulator. Here, we show that QseE is a second bacterial adrenergic receptor that gauges the stress signals Epi, sulfate, and phosphate. The qseEF genes are organized within an unusual operonic structure, in that a gene is encoded between qseE and qseF. This gene was renamed qseG, and it was shown to encode an outer membrane (OM) protein. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to translocate effector proteins to the epithelial cells that rearrange the host cytoskeleton to form pedestal-like structures that cup the bacterium. QseE, QseG, and QseF are necessary for pedestal formation. Although QseE and QseF are involved in the transcriptional control of genes necessary for pedestal formation, QseG is necessary for translocation of effectors into epithelial cells. QseG is an OM protein necessary for translocation of TTSS effectors that also works in conjunction with a 2-component signaling system that senses host stress signals.",M1
19234788,"Relative efficiencies of plasma catechol levels and ratios for neonatal diagnosis of menkes disease.BACKGROUND: Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from mutation in a copper-transporting ATPase gene. Menkes disease can be detected by relatively high concentrations of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites compared to norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites, presumably because dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) requires copper as a co-factor. The relative diagnostic efficiencies of levels of catechol analytes, alone or in combination, in neonates at genetic risk of Menkes disease have been unknown. METHODS: Plasma from 44 at-risk neonates less than 30 days old were assayed for DA, NE, and other catechols. Of the 44, 19 were diagnosed subsequently with Menkes disease, and 25 were unaffected. RESULTS: Compared to unaffected at-risk infants, those with Menkes disease had high plasma DA (P &lt; 10(-6)) and low NE (P &lt; 10(-6)) levels. Considered alone, neither DA nor NE levels had perfect sensitivity, whereas the ratio of DA:NE was higher in all affected than in all unaffected subjects (P = 2 x 10(-8)). Analogously, levels of the DA metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and the NE metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), were imperfectly sensitive, whereas the DOPAC:DHPG ratio was higher in all affected than in all unaffected subjects (P = 2 x 10(-4)). Plasma dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the ratio of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>):NE levels were higher in affected than in unaffected neonates (P = 0.0015; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma DA:NE and DOPAC:DHPG ratios are remarkably sensitive and specific for diagnosing Menkes disease in at-risk newborns. Affected newborns also have elevated DOPA and EPI:NE ratios, which decreased DBH activity alone cannot explain.",M1
19225179,"Regulator of G protein signaling protein suppression of Galphao protein-mediated alpha2A adrenergic receptor inhibition of mouse hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity.Activation of G protein-coupled alpha(2) adrenergic receptors (ARs) inhibits epileptiform activity in the hippocampal CA3 region. The specific mechanism underlying this action is unclear. This study investigated which subtype(s) of alpha(2)ARs and G proteins (Galpha(o) or Galpha(i)) are involved in this response using recordings of mouse hippocampal CA3 epileptiform bursts. Application of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) or norepinephrine (NE) reduced the frequency of bursts in a concentration-dependent manner: (-)EPI &gt; (-)NE &gt;&gt;&gt; (+)NE. To identify the alpha(2)AR subtype involved, equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(b)) were determined for the selective alphaAR antagonists atipamezole (8.79), rauwolscine (7.75), 2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane hydrochloride (WB-4101; 6.87), and prazosin (5.71). Calculated pK(b) values correlated best with affinities determined previously for the mouse alpha(2A)AR subtype (r = 0.98, slope = 1.07). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of EPI were lost in hippocampal slices from alpha(2A)AR-but not alpha(2C)AR-knockout mice. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin also reduced the EPI-mediated inhibition of epileptiform bursts. Finally, using knock-in mice with point mutations that disrupt regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) binding to Galpha subunits to enhance signaling by that G protein, the EPI-mediated inhibition of bursts was significantly more potent in slices from RGS-insensitive Galpha(o)(G184S) heterozygous (Galpha(o)+/GS) mice compared with either Galpha(i2)(G184S) heterozygous (Galpha(i2)+/GS) or control mice (EC(50) = 2.5 versus 19 and 23 nM, respectively). Together, these findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of EPI on hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity uses an alpha(2A)AR/Galpha(o) protein-mediated pathway under strong inhibitory control by RGS proteins. This suggests a possible role for RGS inhibitors or selective alpha(2A)AR agonists as a novel antiepileptic drug therapy.",M1
19211521,"Concurrent supplementation of arginine, vitamin E, and vitamin C improve cardiopulmonary performance in broilers chickens.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of arginine, vitamin E (VE), and vitamin C (VC) on cardiopulmonary performance and ascites parameters of broilers reared under a cold environmental temperature. One-day-old male broilers were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet (control, 1.2% arginine and 40 IU of VE), or the basal diet supplemented with 1% arginine and either 200 IU vitamin E (AE), 500 mg of vitamin C (AC), or a combination of VE and VC at the same amounts (AEC) per kilogram of feed. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and mean arterial pressure were recorded in clinically healthy, anesthetized birds (28 to 42 d old) before and after an epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) challenge (0.5 mg/kg of BW, i.v.), an aminoguanidine hemisulfate challenge (100 mg/kg of BW, i.v.), and an N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester challenge (50 mg/kg of BW, i.v.) at 20-min intervals. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, and the Student Newman-Keuls test was used to separate means within groups. The PAP increased 30 s after the Epi challenge in all birds, but the peak PAP was lower in the AEC group than in all the other groups, whereas birds in the AE and AC groups had lower PAP peaks than did the control group. After 120 s of challenge, the PAP was lower in AEC birds compared with the other birds. The PAP returned to pre-Epi amounts within 300 s in all groups. The PAP was increased (P &lt; 0.05) within 60 s after the aminoguanidine hemisulfate and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester challenges in all groups, but no differences were found among groups. The mean arterial pressure responses did not differ among groups. Plasma NO was greater in the AEC group than in all the other groups before and after the Epi challenge. These results showed that Epi elicited lower amplitude PAP and less prolonged increases in PAP in birds from the AEC group, and this may have been related to the increased vasodilation attributable to NO production. The AEC may have had complementary effects against oxidative stress, protecting the endothelium and preserving NO function.",M1
19185242,"Optimizing the intracameral dilation regimen for cataract surgery: prospective randomized comparison of 2 solutions.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of <e>epi</e>-Shugarcaine solution (epinephrine 0.025% and lidocaine 0.75% in fortified balanced salt solution [BSS Plus]) (epi-S) and Lundberg and Behndig's intracameral dilation solution (cyclopentolate 0.1%, phenylephrine 1.5%, and lidocaine 1%) (LB) for intracameral dilation for cataract surgery. SETTING: Private clinic, Lincolnwood, Illinois, USA. METHODS: In this paired-eye single-masked prospective study, the first eye scheduled for surgery was randomized to receive LB solution or epi-S solution intracamerally at the time of cataract surgery; the second eye to have surgery received the alternative solution. Each eye received 1 drop of tropicamide 1% at least 20 minutes before the start of surgery. Pupil measurements were made before the incision was created, 1 minute after intracameral solution injection, after the anterior chamber was filled with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device, and at the conclusion of the case. Pupil size was objectively graded via software operated by a video technician who was masked to which solution was used. RESULTS: Eighty-four eyes of 42 patients were enrolled in the study. At each time point after instillation, the pupil was statistically significantly larger with epi-S solution than with LB solution, averaging 0.528 mm larger 1 minute after instillation (mean 7.183 versus 6.665 mm) to 0.34 mm larger (mean 7.381 versus 7.040 mm) by the end of the case. CONCLUSION: When combined with 1 drop of tropicamide 1% preoperatively, both formulations provided safe and effective intracameral dilation for cataract surgery; however, the epi-S solution was the more efficacious at each step of the procedure.",M1

19120157,"Sympathetic nervous system response to orthostatic stress in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Sympathoneural and adrenomedullary impairments have been suggested in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, sympathoneural and adrenomedullary responses to orthostasis were evaluated in eight female RA patients and in eight matched healthy controls. The testing consisted of sequence of stabilization period in supine position, legs-up position, orthostasis, and supine position. In each body position, blood samples were drawn and ECG was recorded. Plasma levels of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), norepinephrine (NE) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were measured and sympathoneural activity was evaluated by analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Higher baseline NE levels were found in RA patients (P= 0.034), without any difference in response to orthostasis between the study groups. Levels of EPI tended to be lower in RA patients in base line (P= 0.053) and in response to orthostasis (P= 0.079). The RA and control groups did not differ in NPY levels or in HRV parameters considered to reflect sympathetic activity. A subtle tendency to decreased adrenomedullary reactivity but no evidence for abnormal sympathetic responses to orthostasis was found in RA females.",M1
19120117,"Adrenergic responses to stress: transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes.Stress effects on adrenergic responses in rats were examined in adrenal medulla, the primary source of circulating epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>). Irrespective of duration, immobilization (IMMO) increased adrenal corticosterone to the same extent. In contrast, Epi changed little, suggesting that Epi synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological changes required of the  flight or fight  response. IMMO also induced the Epi-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The rise in its mRNA and protein was preceded by increases in Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex formation. With repeated and prolonged stress, PNMT protein did not reflect the magnitude of change in mRNA. The latter suggests that post-transcriptional, in addition to transcriptional mechanisms, regulate PNMT responses to stress. To further reveal molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes in adrenergic function, the effects of hypoxia on PNMT promoter-driven gene expression are being examined in adrenal medulla-derived PC12 cells. Hypoxia activates the PNMT promoter to increase PNMT promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression and endogenous PNMT in PC12 cells. Induction of both appear mediated via activation of multiple signaling pathways and downstream activation of hypoxia inducible factor and PNMT transcriptional activators, Egr-1 and Sp1. Hypoxia generates both partially and fully processed forms of PNMT mRNA. The former reportedly is translated into a truncated, nonfunctional protein, and the latter into enzymatically active PNMT. Together, findings suggest that stress increases PNMT gene transcriptional activity but post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms limit the biological end-point of functional PNMT enzyme and, thereby, Epi.",M1
19120110,"Hypergravity-induced increase in plasma catecholamine and corticosterone levels in telemetrically collected blood of rats during centrifugation.Rats subjected to various accelerations (+G) exhibited increased levels of plasma epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), norepinephrine (NE), and corticosterone. However, the collection of blood was performed after a centrifugation finished, and therefore the levels could be affected by the process of deceleration. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma EPI, NE, and corticosterone levels in blood collected directly during centrifugation after reaching different G (2-6), using newly developed remote-controlled equipment. Animals placed into the centrifuge cabins had inserted polyethylene tubing in the tail artery, which was connected with a preprogrammed device for blood withdrawals. Plasma EPI, NE, and corticosterone levels were measured at different time intervals of hypergravity of 2-6G. Plasma EPI levels showed a huge, hypergravity-level-dependent increase. After the last blood collection was completed during hypergravity, the centrifuge was turned off and another blood sampling was performed immediately after the centrifuge stopped (10 min). In these samples, plasma EPI showed significantly lower levels compared to centrifugation intervals. Plasma NE levels were significantly increased after 6G only. The increase in plasma corticosterone was dependent on level of G, however after the centrifuge stopped, corticosterone levels remained elevated. Thus, our data show that hypergravity highly activates the adrenomedullary and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical systems, whereas the sympathoneural system is activated only at high hypergravity. Immediately after centrifugation is over, EPI levels quickly return to control values. Our technique of blood collection during centrifugation allows assessment of the real hormonal levels at the particular hypergravity value.",M1
19111123,"[Effects of anisodamine on microcirculation of the asystole rats during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation]OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of anisodamine (Ani) on microcirculation and reperfusion volume of intestine wall in Wistar rats during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA). METHODS: Healthy Wistar rats subjected to CA and resuscitation were randomly divided into four groups, 15 rats in each group. After a 4-minute-non-intervention interval, CPR was started. After CPR for 4 minutes the animals in control group received normal saline, group epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) received Epi (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg), Epi plus low dosage Ani (Ld Ani) group received Epi plus Ani (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg Epi followed by Ani of 5 mg/kg), and Epi plus high dosage Ani (Hd Ani) group received Epi plus Ani (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg Epi followed by Ani of 10 mg/kg). The recanalization rate of mesenteric arterioles and venules, caliber of the recanalized mesentery arteriole and venule, and the reperfusion volume of intestine wall were observed in vivo in rats with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). RESULTS: As the rate of recanalization of mesenteric arterioles and venules was compared, group Hd Ani (66.6%, 60.0%)&gt;group Ld Ani (60.0%, 53.3%)&gt;group control (40.0%, 40.0%)&gt;group Epi (26.7%, 20.0%), and group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani was much better than group Epi(all P&lt;0.05). When the caliber of arterioles and venules was compared, group Hd Ani&gt;group Ld Ani&gt;group control&gt;group Epi 30 minutes and 60 minutes after ROSC. Thirty minutes after ROSC, the caliber of arterioles and venules was much larger in group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani than that in group Epi (all P&lt;0.05). Sixty minutes after ROSC, there was no statistical difference in the caliber of venules between group Ld Ani and group Epi, so as between group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani. Reperfusion volume of intestine wall in group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani was higher than that in groups control and Epi 15 minutes after ROSC, and it kept on to be better up to 60 minutes after ROSC. CONCLUSION: Administration of Ani at earlier period of resuscitation could improve microcirculation of the tissue and raise ROSC rate and successful rate of resuscitation.",M1
19111117,"[The influence of anisodamine on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rat]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of anisodamine (Ani) on restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate in a randomized, blinded experimental study so as to explore a new treatment for CPR. METHODS: Forty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to three groups: control group (0.9% normal saline), epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) group and Epi plus Ani group (combined group), 15 rats in each group. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) or asystole was induced by transoesophageal alternating current stimulation. A blinded drug administration and mechanical chest compression were used in this study (Epi 200 microg/kg, Ani 10 mg/kg). ROSC rate and resuscitation rate were compared among these groups. RESULTS: Combined group had higher ROSC rate(93.3% vs. 46.7%), resuscitation rate (80.0% vs.33.3%) and survival rate within 3 hours (83.3% vs.20.0%) compared with Epi group (all P&lt;0.05). ROSC occurred only in one rat of control group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the beginning of ROSC in Epi group was higher compared with combined group (P&lt;0.05). After ROSC, MAP decreased in both drug groups, especially after 5 minutes of ROSC, and MAP in Epi group was lower than that of combined group. There was difference between the two groups till 30 minutes after ROSC (all P&lt;0.05) .

18999898,"Adrenomedullary, adrenocortical, and sympathoneural responses to stressors: a meta-analysis.OBJECTIVE: Exposure to stressors alters activities of the adrenomedullary hormonal system (AHS), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, and sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here we report results of a meta-analysis of the literature, examining inter-relationships among AHS, HPA, and SNS responses to stressors, as measured by plasma epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), corticotrophin (ACTH), and norepinephrine (NE) levels. METHODS: The medical scientific literature was culled by PubMed searches, to retrieve publications describing original data about plasma EPI, ACTH, and NE levels measured before and during or after exposure to stressors. Magnitudes of responses were graded from a score of 0 for no response to 4 for a massive increase to &gt;or=10 times the baseline value. RESULTS: A total of 15 stressors were identified for which at least 2 publications reported data for EPI, ACTH, and NE responses. A total of 60 reports were included. Mean EPI responses were strongly positively correlated with mean ACTH responses (r=0.93) and less strongly with NE responses (r=0.40). Plasma EPI responses were disproportionately larger than NE responses during hypoglycemia and smaller than NE responses during cold exposure without hypothermia, orthostasis, and active escape/avoidance. Plasma NE responses were disproportionately larger than ACTH responses during cold exposure without hypothermia and severe/exhausting exercise and smaller than ACTH responses during hypoglycemia. DISCUSSION: The results of this meta-analysis indicate a close association between adrenomedullary and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical responses across a variety of stressors. This association seems to be if anything stronger than that between adrenomedullary and sympathetic noradrenergic responses.",M1
18955128,"Stress-induced changes in the expression of monocytic beta2-integrins: the impact of arousal of negative affect and adrenergic responses to the Anger Recall Interview.Adhesion of circulating monocytes to the vascular endothelium is one of the earliest steps in the development of atherosclerosis. This leukocyte-to-endothelium interaction is mediated in part by beta2-integrins, a group of cell adhesion molecules that bind to endothelial ligands. Given the significance of this interaction to atherogenesis, we examined the effects of stress, operationalized as the arousal of negative affect (NA) and cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to the Anger Recall Interview (ARI), on the expression of LFA-1 (CD11a), Mac-1 (CD11b) and p150/95 (CD11c) on circulating monocytes (CD14+). Subjects were 173 healthy, nonsmoking men and women (60% men, 40% minorities, aged 18-49 year). Arousal of NA, cardiovascular responses (heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP]), circulating catecholamines (epinephrine [<e>Epi</e>], norepinephrine [Ne]) and beta2-integrin (CD11/CD18) expression were determined prior to and following the ARI. The principal findings were that the ARI, on average, induced a decrease in monocyte expression of beta2-integrins. However, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, exercise status, and baseline level of beta2-integrin expression, those individuals who showed the largest increases in NA, Ne and DBP during the ARI showed an increase in monocyte beta2-integrin expression. Thus, heightened psychological and physiological stress responses induced phenotypic changes in monocytic expression of beta2-integrins that are consistent with the role of monocytes/macrophages in vascular inflammation and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",M1
18814973,"Blocking of beta-2 adrenergic receptors hastens recovery from hypoglycemia-associated social withdrawal.OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia is associated with a variety of adverse behaviors including fatigue, confusion and social withdrawal. While these clinical symptoms are well characterized, the mechanism of their cause is not understood. Here we investigated how insulin-induced hypoglycemia causes social withdrawal. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Male 8-12-week-old C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with or without and/or insulin, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>), terbutaline and butoxamine with subsequent measurement of blood glucose, social withdrawal and plasma catecholamines. RESULTS: Insulin generated (0.75h post-injection) significant hypoglycemia with blood glucose nadirs of 64+/-4 and 48+/-5mg/dl for 0.8 and 1.2units/kg of insulin, respectively. Insulin (0.8 or 1.2units/kg) caused near total social withdrawal at 0.75h with full recovery not occurring until 4h (0.8units/kg) or 8h (1.2units/kg) post-insulin injection. Insulin also caused a marked elevation in plasma catecholamines. Basal 12h fasting NE and Epi were 287+/-38 and 350+/-47pg/ml, respectively. Insulin at 0.8units/kg increased plasma NE and Epi to 994+/-73 and 1842+/-473pg/ml, respectively. Administration of exogenous NE or Epi caused social withdrawal similar in magnitude to insulin. Importantly, administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline also caused social withdrawal while administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist butoxamine blocked NE-induced social withdrawal. Finally, butoxamine blocked insulin-induced social withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hypoglycemia-associated social withdrawal is dependent on catecholamines via a beta-2 receptor-mediated pathway.",M1
18772317,"Distinct interactions of human beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.Fluorescence studies with purified human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) revealed that the endogenous catecholamines, (-)-epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), (-)-norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DOP), stabilize distinct active receptor conformations. However, the functional relevance of these ligand-specific conformations is as yet poorly understood. We addressed this question by studying fusion proteins of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta(1)AR) and beta(2)AR with the short and long splice variants of G(s)alpha (G(s)alpha(S) and G(s)alpha(L)), respectively. Fusion proteins ensure efficient receptor/G-protein coupling and defined stoichiometry of the coupling partners. EPI, NE, DOP, and the prototypical synthetic betaAR agonist, (-)-isoproterenol (ISO), showed marked differences in their efficacies at stabilizing the high-affinity ternary complex at beta(1)AR-G(s)alpha and beta(2)AR-G(s)alpha fusion proteins. Ternary complex formation was more sensitive to disruption by GTP with the beta(2)AR than with the beta(1)AR. Generally, in steady-state GTPase assays, ISO, EPI, and NE were full agonists, and DOP was a partial agonist. Exceptionally, at beta(1)AR-G(s)alpha(L), NE was only a partial agonist. Generally, in adenylyl cyclase assays, ISO, EPI, and NE were full agonists, and DOP was a partial agonist. At beta(2)AR-G(s)alpha(L), NE was only a partial agonist. There was no correlation between efficacy at stabilizing the ternary complex and activating GTPase, and there were also dissociations between K(i) values for high-affinity agonist binding and EC(50) values for GTPase activation. In contrast to synthetic partial agonists, DOP did not exhibit increased efficacy at betaAR-G(s)alpha(L) versus betaAR-G(s)alpha(S) fusion proteins. In conclusion, our data with betaAR-G(s)alpha fusion proteins show that endogenous catecholamines and ISO stabilize distinct conformations in the beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR.",M1
18760200,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy modifies the neurohormonal profile, hemodynamic and functional capacity in heart failure patients.BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve the clinical status and survival in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, but little is known about its influence on neurohormonal profile. METHODS: Heart failure patients treated with CRT for moderate/severe heart failure were studied with echocardiography, cardiopulmonary test, and neurohormonal profile [brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), endothelin (END), big endothelin (big-END), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] at baseline and after 1 year from the pacemaker implantation. RESULTS: 120 NYHA II-IV patients entered this study, all with an indication to CRT; 100 agreed to be implanted (group A), whereas 20 refused, identifying a control group (group B). In group A NYHA class (from 3.15+/-0.49-1.15+/-0.49, p=0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (from 19.6+/-4.95-35.6+/-5.95%, p=0.001), severity of mitral regurgitation (from 13.3+/-4.19-6.09+/-4.11 cmq, p=0.001), and peak VO(2) (from 9.68+/-4.61-13.35+/-3.32 mL/kg/min, p=0.001) improved at 1-year follow-up. In the neurohormonal profile only plasma BNP (from 185.1+/-185.9-110.2+/-137.5 pg/mL, p=0.03) and big-END (from 1.8+/-1.5-0.87+/-0.7 fmol/mL, p=0.007) were reduced significantly. None of these parameters significantly changed in the control group at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate/severe heart failure, CRT improved clinical status and the functional parameters modifying the neurohormonal profile at 1-year follow-up.",M1
18751928,"Antiplatelet agents sarpogrelate and cilostazol affect experimentally-induced ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.Antiplatelet agents, sarpogrelate (SAR), a 5-hydroxy tryptamine 2A receptor antagonist and cilostazol (CIL), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, were observed to be beneficial in attenuating cardiac remodeling and improving cardiac function in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction in rats; however, CIL increased ventricular tachycardia and mortality. In order to study the effects of these antiplatelet agents on arrhythmias, Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either SAR or CIL (5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks and were then either injected cumulative doses of epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) or subjected to coronary occlusion. Saline-treated animals served as controls. Electrocardiographic analysis revealed that SAR pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias (time of onset of arrhythmias as well as the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions, salvos, tachycardia, and fibrillations), whereas CIL treatment augmented the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias due to both Epi and coronary occlusion. None of the drugs affected the corrected QT interval significantly. Furthermore, the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in left ventricle were markedly higher in CIL-pretreated rats when compared to SAR-pretreated or control rats. It is suggested that an excessive level of cAMP may contribute to increase incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in animals pretreated with CIL, unlike the SAR-pretreated rats.",M1
18626080,"In vivo regulation of rainbow trout lipolysis by catecholamines.Lipolysis provides fatty acids that support key life processes by functioning as membrane components, oxidative fuels and metabolic signals. It is commonly measured as the rate of appearance of glycerol (Ra glycerol). Its in vivo regulation by catecholamines has been thoroughly investigated in mammals, but little information is available for ectotherms. Therefore, the goals of this study were, first, to characterize the effects of the catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) on the lipolytic rate of intact rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and, second, to determine whether the plasma glycerol concentration is a reliable index of Ra glycerol. Our results show that baseline Ra glycerol (4.6+/-0.4 micromol kg(-1) min(-1)) is inhibited by NE (-56%), instead of being stimulated, as in mammals, whereas Epi has the same activating effect in both groups of vertebrates (+167%). NE-induced inhibition of fish lipolysis might play a particularly important role during aquatic hypoxia, when survival often depends on regulated metabolic depression. The plasma glycerol concentration is a poor predictor of Ra glycerol, and it should not be used as an index of lipolysis. Trout maintain a particularly high baseline lipolytic rate because only 13% of the fatty acids provided are sufficient to support total energy expenditure, whereas the remaining fatty acids must undergo reesterification (87%).",M1
18552143,"In vivo PET imaging of cardiac presynaptic sympathoneuronal mechanisms in the rat.The sympathetic nervous system of the heart plays a key role in the pathophysiology of various cardiac diseases. Small-animal models are valuable for obtaining further insight into mechanisms of cardiac disease and therapy. To determine the translational potential of cardiac neuronal imaging from rodents to humans, we characterized the rat sympathetic nervous system using 3 radiotracers that reflect different subcellular mechanisms: (11)C-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED), a tracer of neuronal transport showing stable uptake and no washout in healthy humans; (11)C-phenylephrine (PHEN), a tracer of vesicular leakage and intraneuronal metabolic degradation with initial uptake and subsequent washout in humans; and (11)C-epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), a tracer of vesicular storage with stable uptake and no washout in humans. METHODS: We used a small-animal PET system to study healthy male Wistar rats at baseline, after desipramine (DMI) pretreatment (DMI block), and with DMI injection 15 min after tracer delivery (DMI chase). The rats were kept under general isoflurane anesthesia while dynamic emission scans of the heart were recorded for 60 min after radiotracer injection. A myocardial retention index was determined by normalizing uptake at 40 min to the integral under the arterial input curve. Washout rates were determined by monoexponential fitting of myocardial time-activity curves. RESULTS: At baseline, HED showed high myocardial uptake and sustained retention, EPI showed moderate uptake and significant biphasic washout, and PHEN showed moderate uptake and monoexponential washout. The average (+/- SD) left ventricular retention index for HED, PHEN, and EPI was 7.38% +/- 0.82%/min, 3.43% +/- 0.45%/min, and 4.24% +/- 0.59%/min, respectively; the washout rate for HED, PHEN, and EPI was 0.13% +/- 0.23%/min, 1.13% +/- 0.35%/min, and 0.50% +/- 0.24%/min, respectively. The DMI chase resulted in increased washout only for HED. DMI block decreased myocardial uptake of all tracers by less than 90%. CONCLUSION: Kinetic profiles of HED in the rat myocardium were similar to those of HED in humans, suggesting comparable neuronal transport density. Unlike in humans, however, significant washout of EPI and faster washout of PHEN were encountered, consistent with high intraneuronal metabolic activity, high catecholamine turnover, and reduced vesicular storage. This evidence of increased neuronal activity in rodents has implications for translational studies of cardiac neuronal biology in humans.",M1
18445148,"Single wavelength micro-endoscopy in non-surgical vascular lesion diagnosis &amp; characterization.Malignant and dysplastic epithelial lesions have often been reported to excite vascular responses by histopathological characterization. Little is reported concerning in vivo real-time imaging of vascular patterns and flow in health or disease but the development of miniature imaging instrumentation has now allowed such developments. We describe the application of a selective wavelength (540 nm) <e>epi</e>-illumination Hopkins pattern endoscopic imaging system to image vascular tissues and capillary blood flow in vivo. The contrast mechanism in such imaging was characterized, haemoglobin acting as a chromatic transmission filter despite endoscopy being a non-invasive and therefore principally reflection mode imaging system. In vivo adrenergic vascular responses, capillary flow rate variations over time and variations in normal capillary architecture around the oral cavity were recorded; demonstrating that simple imaging systems can be used for non-surgical diagnosis and characterization of vascular lesions, tumours and treatment responses.",M1
18339207,"Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study.BACKGROUND: Epinephrine remains the drug of choice for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The aim of the present study is to assess whether the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine, given their different mechanisms of action, provides better results than epinephrine alone in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 22 Landrace/Large-White piglets, which were left untreated for 8 minutes before attempted resuscitation with precordial compression, mechanical ventilation and electrical defibrillation. Animals were randomized into 2 groups during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 11 animals who received saline as placebo (20 ml dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (<e>Epi</e> group); and 11 animals who received vasopressin (0.4 IU/kg/20 ml dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Vaso-Epi group). Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: Ten of 11 animals in the Vaso-Epi group restored spontaneous circulation in comparison to only 4 of 11 in the Epi group (p = 0.02). Aortic diastolic pressure, as well as, coronary perfusion pressure were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the Vaso-Epi group. CONCLUSION: The administration of vasopressin in combination with epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation results in a drastic improvement in the hemodynamic parameters necessary for the return of spontaneous circulation.",M1
18301218,"Beta-adrenergic blockade exacerbates sepsis-induced changes in tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in skeletal muscle and is associated with impaired translation initiation.BACKGROUND: Sepsis stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. The resultant elevation in plasma catecholamines, both norepinephrine and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>), might be expected to alter the expression of inflammatory cytokines, which may directly or indirectly influence muscle protein balance. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) determine whether Epi per se increases cytokine expression in skeletal muscle, and (2) determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade alters the sepsis-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators of protein balance in skeletal muscle. METHODS: In the first study, rats were infused with Epi for 2 hour to increase the circulating Epi concentration to levels seen in septic animals. In the second study, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture and a nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockade produced with a continuous infusion of propranolol (PP). Tissues were obtained 24 after induction of sepsis and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 mRNA and protein content. In addition, the tissue content of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and various regulators of protein synthesis were assessed. RESULTS: Epi acutely increased TNF-alpha IL-6 and IL-1beta mRNA content in muscle (3- to 40-fold). However, only the TNF-alpha and IL-6 protein content was increased in muscle by Epi. In the second study, beta-adrenergic blockade with PP exacerbated the sepsis-induced increase in muscle IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA but did not alter the increment in IL-1beta or HMGB1. Propranolol also accentuated the sepsis-induced increase in both IL-6 and TNF-alpha protein in muscle. The exaggerated muscle cytokine response in septic rats treated with PP was associated with a reduction in muscle IGF-I protein that was greater than detected in saline-infused septic rats. Finally, the combination of sepsis + PP also accentuated the sepsis-induced decrease in the phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein-1, ribosomal protein S6, and mTOR, which are key proteins controlling protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that although Epi is capable of increasing tissue cytokines in naive rats, inhibition of the beta-adrenergic effects of catecholamines exacerbates the sepsis-induced increase of selected inflammatory cytokines. This exaggerated tissue response is associated with alterations in muscle IGF-I protein and translation initiation, which would be expected to impair tissue protein synthesis.",M1
18292436,"The effect of maternal catecholamines on the caliber of gravid uterine microvessels.BACKGROUND: Changes in maternal catecholamines that accompany the onset of labor analgesia include a decrease in epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) but no change in norepinephrine (NE). Because EPI exerts predominantly beta-adrenergic, and NE predominantly alpha-adrenergic effects in circulating concentrations, we hypothesized that these changes could lead to uterine arteriole vasoconstriction. METHODS: Uterine microvessels (73-120 microm internal diameter, n = 18) were harvested from near-term pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, isolated and studied in a pressurized no-flow state with video microscopy. Drugs were applied extraluminally to the superfusion reservoir and the steady-state vessel diameter recorded. Dose-response curves were constructed for NE with and without the addition of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin, EPI (after 20%-30% preconstruction with the thromboxane analog U46619) with and without the addition of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and NE in the presence of 10(-8) M EPI. Washout experiments modeled the changes in circulating maternal catecholamines observed during onset of analgesia: 10(-8) M EPI and 10(-6.5) M of NE (the EC50) were added simultaneously, then washed with NE only, and then with the beta2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline and NE. The washout protocol was repeated in the presence of propranolol. RESULTS: NE caused dose-dependent vasoconstriction (P &lt; 0.0001), which was blocked by prazosin (P &lt; 0.0001). EPI, added to U46619-preconstricted microvessels, caused vasodilation at lower concentrations and vasoconstriction at higher doses (P &lt; 0.0001). Propranolol converted this response to monophasic dose-dependent vasoconstriction (P &lt; 0.0001). Pretreatment of nonprecontracted vessels with EPI, 10(-8) M, significantly attenuated NE-induced vasoconstriction (P &lt; 0.0001). In washout experiments, removal of EPI with continued presence of NE resulted in vasoconstriction that was reversed by terbutaline. Propranolol blocked the effect of both EPI and terbutaline. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that EPI, in concentrations found in the plasma of laboring women, vasodilates uterine resistance vessels and attenuates NE-induced vasoconstriction. This observation may have implications for changes in uterine blood flow that may accompany the onset of labor analgesia in human parturients, as effective analgesia is accompanied by an acute decrease in circulating EPI levels.",M1
18096057,"The presence of beta2-adrenoceptors sensitizes alpha2A-adrenoceptors to desensitization after chronic epinephrine treatment.BACKGROUND: In addition to the regulation of blood pressure, alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes play an important role in the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the human CNS and PNS. Several studies suggest that the alpha2-AR responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) or norepinephrine (NE) exposure may vary, depending on the beta-AR activity present there. Recently, we reported that in BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells (endogenously expressing alpha2A- and beta2-AR), chronic EPI treatment (300 nM) produced a dramatic beta-adrenoceptor-dependent desensitization of the alpha2A-AR response. The aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a beta2-AR to a second neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), that normally expresses only alpha2A-ARs that are not sensitive to 300 nM EPI exposure, would suddenly render alpha2A-ARs in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same EPI concentration. METHODS: These studies employed RT-PCR, receptor binding and inhibition of cAMP accumulation to confirm alpha2-AR subtype expression. Stable clones of SH-SY5Y cells transfected to stably express functional beta2-ARs (SHbeta2AR4) were selected to compare sensitivity of alpha2-AR to EPI in the presence or absence of beta2-ARs. RESULTS: A series of molecular, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicated that the difference between the cell lines could not be attributed to alpha2-AR heterogeneity. We now report that after transfection of functional beta2-AR into SH-SY5Y cells (SHbeta2AR4), chronic treatment with modest levels of EPI desensitizes the alpha2A-AR. This effect results from a beta2-AR dependent down-regulation of native alpha2A-ARs by EPI accompanied by enhanced translocation of GRK2 and GRK3 to the membrane (required for GRK-mediated phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors). CONCLUSION: This study further supports the hypothesis that the presence of the beta-AR renders the alpha2A-AR more susceptible to desensitization with physiological levels of EPI.",M1
18056263,"Norepinephrine- and epinephrine-induced distinct beta2-adrenoceptor signaling is dictated by GRK2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes.Agonist-dependent activation of G protein-coupled receptors induces diversified receptor cellular and signaling properties. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) are two endogenous ligands that activate adrenoceptor (AR) signals in a variety of physiological stress responses in animals. Here we use cardiomyocyte contraction rate response to analyze the endogenous beta(2)AR signaling induced by Epi or NE in cardiac tissue. The Epi-activated beta(2)AR induced a rapid contraction rate increase that peaked at 4 min after stimulation. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)AR induced a much slower contraction rate increase that peaked at 10 min after stimulation. Whereas both drugs activated beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) proteins, only Epi-activated receptors were capable of coupling to G(i) proteins. Subsequent studies showed that the Epi-activated beta(2)AR underwent a rapid phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and subsequent dephosphorylation on serine residues 355 and 356, which was critical for sufficient receptor recycling and G(i) coupling. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)ARs underwent slow GRK2 phosphorylation, receptor internalization and recycling, and failed to couple to G(i). Moreover, inhibiting beta(2)AR phosphorylation by betaARK C terminus or dephosphorylation by okadaic acid prevented sufficient recycling and G(i) coupling. Together, our data revealed that distinct temporal phosphorylation of beta(2)AR on serine 355 and 356 by GRK2 plays a critical role for dictating receptor cellular events and signaling properties induced by Epi or NE in cardiomyocytes. This study not only helps us understand the endogenous agonist-dependent beta(2)AR signaling in animal heart but also offers an example of how G protein-coupled receptor signaling may be finely regulated by GRK in physiological settings.",M1
18034764,"Usefulness of PFA-100 testing in the diagnostic screening of patients with suspected abnormalities of hemostasis: comparison with the bleeding time.BACKGROUND: Global tests of hemostasis that are used to screen patients with clinical suspicion of bleeding disorders should help the physician to identify the phase of the hemostatic system that is abnormal and guide further diagnostic workup. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the performance of Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) closure time (CT) with bleeding time (BT), both of which are screening tests for primary hemostasis, in the diagnostic workup of 128 consecutive patients who were screened for bleeding disorders. The sensitivities of BT and PFA-100 CT for known defects of hemostasis were evaluated; in addition, we calculated their correlation with the levels of severity of the bleeding symptoms, which were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The sensitivity of PFA-100 testing was 71% for von Willebrand disease (VWD) [with both collagen-adenosine diphosphate (C-ADP) and collagen-epinephrine (C-<e>EPI</e>) cartridges]; 58% (C-EPI) and 8% (C-ADP) for platelet function disorders (PFDs); and the sensitivity of BT was 29% (VWD) and 33% (PFD). C-EPI CT was also prolonged in about 20% of patients with abnormalities of coagulation or fibrinolysis. Only the C-EPI CT was significantly associated with the levels of severity of the patients' bleeding scores. CONCLUSIONS: BT and C-EPI are insufficiently sensitive to be recommended as hemostasis screening tests. The C-ADP cartridge, which is sensitive to VWD only, might prove useful in further diagnostic workup of defects of primary hemostasis. The association of C-EPI CT with the severity of bleeding symptoms as a useful predictor of risk of bleeding in clinical practise should be tested in properly designed studies.",M1
18022498,"Combination of cardiac pacing and epinephrine does not always improve outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.We hypothesized that the combination of cardiac pacing and epinephrine would yield a better efficacy for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the combination of 2 therapies at different opportunity would achieve the same results of CPR. Cardiac arrest was induced by clamping the tracheal tubes in 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. At 10 minutes of asphyxia, the animals were prospectively randomized into 5 groups (n = 12/group), and received saline (Sal-gro, 1 mL, intravenous [i.v.]), epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>-gro, 0.4 mg/kg, i.v.), pacing (Pac-gro, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with saline 1 mL, i.v.), pacing + epinephrine group 1 (PE-gro1, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg, i.v.), or pacing + epinephrine group 2 (PE-gro2, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg, i.v., 4 minutes after the transesophageal cardiac pacing initiating and failing to resuscitate the animals), followed by initiation of CPR. Restoration of spontaneous circulation in Sal-gro was lower than in Epi-gro, Pac-gro, PE-gro1, and PE-gro2 (16.67% vs 66.67%, 66.67%, 100%, and 100%; P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .001, respectively). The proportions of withdrawing ventilator and 2-hour survival proportions in Pac-gro and PE-gro2 were higher than in Epi-gro and PE-gro1 (8/8, 10/12 vs 1/8, 2/12, respectively, P &lt; .01, and 7/8, 8/12 vs 1/8, 2/12, respectively, P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01). Mean survival time in Pac-gro and PE-gro2 were longer than in Epi-gro and PE-gro1 (P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01). Therefore, the combination of 2 therapies does not always improve outcome of CPR. It is obvious that the combination of transesophageal cardiac pacing with delayed administration of epinephrine yields a better outcome compared to the combination of 2 therapies at the same time during CPR in a rat asphyxia cardiac arrest model.",M1
17919552,"Effects of milrinone on contractility and cyclic adenosine monophosphate production induced by beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor activation in human myocardium.BACKGROUND: Because milrinone is a widely used phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor, it would be of interest to know whether it interacts with beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists in human myocardium. OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study was conducted to test whether milrinone differentially regulates cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) production and to examine the effect of milrinone on the positive inotropic responses and cAMP production induced by activation of the beta1-AR with norepinephrine (NE) and activation of the beta2-AR with epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) in human atrial myocardium. METHODS: Right atrial trabeculae were obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery for valve repair. Concentration-response curves for inotropic responses mediated through the beta1-AR (NE in the presence of the beta2-blocker ICI 118, 551) and the beta2-AR (EPI in the presence of the beta1-blocker CGP 20712A) were obtained in the absence and presence of milrinone 1 micromol/L. This concentration of milrinone was chosen because it corresponded to its 50% inhibitory concentration as a PDE3 inhibitor and its therapeutic plasma concentration. The production of cAMP induced by exposure to selective beta1- and beta2-AR stimulation was also measured in the absence and presence of milrinone. RESULTS: Right atrial tissue samples were obtained from 12 white patients (7 women, 5 men; mean [SE] age, 64.6 [6.3] years) undergoing cardiac surgery for valve repair (8 mitral, 4 aortic). The presence of milrinone was associated with leftward shifts in the concentration-response curves for both NE and EPI. cAMP production in myocardial tissue samples in the presence of milrinone was increased only with NE induction (mean [SEM], 745.0 [136.7] pmol/g in the absence of milrinone vs 1620.5 [372.3] pmol/g in the presence of milrinone; P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study in human atrial myocardium, milrinone potentiated the contractile responses to both NE and EPI. However, only the effect of NE on tissue levels of cAMP was increased in the presence of milrinone.",M1
17917708,"Effect of high dose statin therapy on platelet function; statins reduce aspirin-resistant platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease.BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports the preventive role of statins on platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease. AIM: Our aim was to determine the effects of aggressive statin therapy on platelet function in patients with coronary heart disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 178 consecutive patients (37-68 years old, 35.9% women) with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/<e>Epi</e>) and collagen and ADP (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time (CT) of &lt;186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. A statin therapy protocol applied to the patients with aspirin resistance for 3 months. RESULTS: We determined that 20 (11.2%) of patients had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 83 +/- 18 s (53-162 s). Of the patients 12 were not on a statin therapy and eight were taking 10 mg daily atorvastatin. After 3 months of 40 mg daily atorvastatin therapy 13 subjects with aspirin resistance became aspirin sensitive by PFA-100 (P &lt; 0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol at the third month of statin therapy (P &lt; 0.0001 for all). CONCLUSION: Statin therapy reduced the in vitro aspirin resistance in 65% of the patients after a therapy of 3 months. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of statins' effects on platelet reactivity.",M1
17698731,"Epinephrine is required for normal cardiovascular responses to stress in the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase knockout mouse.BACKGROUND: Epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) is an important neurotransmitter and hormone. Its role in regulating cardiovascular function at rest and with stress is unclear, however. METHODS AND RESULTS: An epinephrine-deficient mouse model was generated in which the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase was knocked out (KO). Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored by telemetry at rest and during graded treadmill exercise. Cardiac structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography in mice under 1 of 2 conditions: unstressed and lightly anesthetized or restrained and awake. In KO mice, resting cardiovascular function, including blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, was the same as that in wild-type mice, and the basal norepinephrine plasma level was normal. However, inhibition of sympathetic innervation with the ganglion blocker hexamethonium caused a 54% smaller decrease in blood pressure in KO mice, and treadmill exercise caused an 11% higher increase in blood pressure, both suggesting impaired vasodilation in KO mice. Interestingly, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase KO did not change the heart rate response to ganglionic blockade and exercise. By echocardiography, KO mice had an increased ratio of left ventricular posterior wall thickness to internal dimensions but did not have cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting concentric remodeling in the KO heart. Finally, in restrained, awake KO mice, heart rate and ejection fraction remained normal, but cardiac output was significantly reduced because of diminished end-diastolic volume. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that epinephrine is required for normal blood pressure and cardiac filling responses to stress but is not required for tachycardia during stress or normal cardiovascular function at rest.",M1
17617081,"Evaluation of platelet function and lack of response to epinephrine in pregnant women.Previous studies in healthy subjects have demonstrated a lack of response of platelets to epinephrine at a rate of 16-40% on an aggregometer. An association between the increased procoagulant factors during pregnancy and venous thromboembolism is known, and it has also been shown that prolactin levels increase platelet aggregation. We evaluated whether platelet functions in pregnant women and also assessed the lack of response to epinephrine during this period. We compared 27 healthy and volunteering pregnant women with 26 similar control subjects. Platelet functions were assessed with an aggregometer and a Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100). Less than 40% response to epinephrine on the aggregometer was defined as an impaired epinephrine response. The aggregation response of epinephrine was normal in 25 of the 27 pregnant women, while two of them showed a late-rising response. Eight of the 26 subject control group (30.8%) showed an impaired response to epinephrine. When we compared the 25 pregnant and 18 control subjects with normal aggregation responses, the maximum aggregation responses to ADP and epinephrine, and the Col/<e>Epi</e> and Col/ADP cartridge closure time values were significantly lower in pregnant women. There were no difference between second and third trimesters as regards platelet function parameters. The fact that no impaired response to epinephrine was detected in pregnant women while a 30% rate was observed in non-pregnant women indicates that the platelet malfunction caused by a disorder in the Gi protein and intracellular mechanisms is bypassed during pregnancy thanks to some physiological changes.",M1
17586459,"Multi-photon microscopic imaging of rat parotid ducts demonstrates cellular heterogeneity in Ca2+ responsiveness.The heterogeneity of salivary ductal cells, with regard to their sensitivity to Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, was visualized by multi-photon microscopy. Stimulation of isolated parotid ducts with 0.1 and 1 microM epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) elevated the intracellular Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in approximately 30% and &gt;90% of the ductal cells, respectively. Of the 0.1 microM Epi-responsive cells, 80% responded rapidly to subsequent stimulation with 1 microM Epi. Similarly, threshold concentrations (0.5 or 1 microM) of phenylephrine (PhL), carbachol (CCh) or ATP, induced responses in approximately 20% of the ductal cells, and subsequent stimulations with 10 microM of the same agonist activated approximately 80% of ductal cells. These observations indicate that parotid ducts contain a certain subpopulation of cells, which exhibits particularly high sensitivity to these Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, compared to the remaining ductal cells. Sequential stimulation with threshold concentrations of PhL, CCh, and ATP induced Ca(2+) responses in approximately 33% of ductal cells. Of these responsive cells, the majority (69%) could only respond to one of the three agonists; while a small minority (9%) were capable of responding to all three agonists. These results indicate that low concentrations of PhL, CCh, and ATP activate different subpopulations of parotid ductal cells.",M1
17448453,"Cardiac epinephrine synthesis and ischemia-induced myocardial epinephrine release.OBJECTIVE: Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme that synthesizes epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) from norepinephrine (NE) in the adrenal gland, is present in extra-adrenal tissues including heart. Ischemia evokes an excessive NE accumulation in the myocardial interstitial spaces. Therefore, cardiac PNMT activity with high NE levels may contribute to cardiac EPI synthesis and release evoked by ischemia. METHODS: We measured dialysate EPI levels in the left ventricle of anesthetized rabbits using a cardiac microdialysis technique. The dialysate EPI level served as an index of the myocardial interstitial EPI level. Locally administered NE-induced dialysate EPI responses were measured. The left circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 60 min and the dialysate EPI and NE levels in the ischemic region were measured. Coronary occlusion-induced EPI responses were compared with and without administration of a PNMT inhibitor (SKF29661) in the presence and absence of desipramine (catecholamine transport blocker). RESULTS: Local administration of NE (250, 2500 ng/ml) increased the EPI levels to 734+/-125 and 2088+/-367 pg/ml respectively. These increases in dialysate EPI were suppressed by the PNMT inhibitor. Acute myocardial ischemia significantly increased the EPI levels to 3607+/-1069 pg/ml in the ischemic region, and these were suppressed by the PNMT inhibitor (1417+/-581 pg/ml). The pretreatment with desipramine suppressed ischemia-induced EPI release, which did not differ with (725+/-155 pg/ml) and without administration of a PNMT inhibitor (743+/-172 pg/ml). CONCLUSION: The cardiac PNMT in the left ventricle is capable of synthesizing EPI with markedly elevated NE levels in the myocardial interstitial space.",M1
17430381,"A pilot study on the effect of epinephrine on botulinum toxin treatment for periorbital rhytides.BACKGROUND: Relaxation of hyperactive facial muscles by injection of botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) represents the most common cosmetic procedure performed in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this split-face randomized double-blind study was to determine the effect of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) on the efficacy of BOTOX treatment of muscle hyperactivity in the upper face. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen subjects (ages 39-57 years) with moderate to severe periorbital rhytides were enrolled. Study patients were blinded to the two treatment arms, BOTOX and BOTOX plus EPI 1:100,000. Subjective and objective evaluations were performed at 0 and 4 days and 1, 3, and 6 months, and clinical improvement was assessed using a nominal scale from 0 to 4, corresponding to 0, 1% to 25%, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%, and 76% to 100% improvement, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was also recorded. RESULTS Fourteen subjects with moderate to severe periorbital rhytides were treated with BOTOX or BOTOX plus EPI. One subject was discontinued from the study after receiving asymmetric doses of BOTOX. At 4, 30, and 90 days after treatment, subjective and objective improvement scores revealed that EPI enhanced the efficacy of BOTOX when compared to BOTOX alone. By 3 months, the effect of BOTOX and BOTOX plus EPI had peaked and continued to fall through 6 months. One of 14 patients did not appear to respond to BOTOX treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we are the first to test under randomized double-blind conditions the effect of EPI on efficacy of BOTOX. Our data suggest that addition of EPI may accelerate the rate of onset as well as the short-term efficacy of BOTOX for treatment of periorbital rhytides.",M1
17394532,"Stress-induced changes in epinephrine expression in the adrenal medulla in vivo.Immobilization (IMMO) stress was used to examine how stress alters the stress hormone epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) in the adrenal medulla in vivo. In rats subjected to IMMO for 30 or 120 min, adrenal corticosterone increased to the same extent. In contrast, EPI changed very little, suggesting that EPI synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological responses of the 'flight or fight' response. In part, stress activates EPI via the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene as single or repeated IMMO elevated PNMT mRNA. The rise in PNMT mRNA was preceded by induction of the PNMT gene activator, Egr-1, with increases in Egr-1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex apparent. IMMO also evoked changes in Sp1 mRNA, protein, and Sp1-DNA complex formation, although for chronic IMMO changes were not entirely coincident. In contrast, glucocorticoid receptor and AP-2 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA complex were unaltered. Finally, IMMO stress elevated PNMT protein. However, with seven daily IMMOs for 120 min and delayed killing, protein stimulation did not attain the highly elevated levels expected based on mRNA changes. The latter may perhaps suggest initiation of adrenergic desensitization to prolonged and repeated IMMO stress and/or dissociation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",M1
17368053,"Adrenergic enhancement of consolidation of object recognition memory.Extensive evidence indicates that epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) modulates memory consolidation for emotionally arousing tasks in animals and human subjects. However, previous studies have not examined the effects of EPI on consolidation of recognition memory. Here we report that systemic administration of EPI enhances consolidation of memory for a novel object recognition (NOR) task under different training conditions. Control male rats given a systemic injection of saline (0.9% NaCl) immediately after NOR training showed significant memory retention when tested at 1.5 or 24, but not 96h after training. In contrast, rats given a post-training injection of EPI showed significant retention of NOR at all delays. In a second experiment using a different training condition, rats treated with EPI, but not SAL-treated animals, showed significant NOR retention at both 1.5 and 24-h delays. We next showed that the EPI-induced enhancement of retention tested at 96h after training was prevented by pretraining systemic administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The findings suggest that, as previously observed in experiments using aversively motivated tasks, epinephrine modulates consolidation of recognition memory and that the effects require activation of beta-adrenoceptors.",M1
17336981,"Characterisation of the sympathetic nervous system of Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephants based on urinary catecholamine analyses.Assessing the welfare status of captive animals using non-invasive measurements of hormones is of growing interest because this can serve as an effective tool to facilitate the optimization of environmental and husbandry conditions. Both the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) exhibit extremely low breeding success in captivity, and because elevated levels of stress may negatively influence reproductive functions, this study sought to establish a method for assessing sympathoadrenal activity in captive female elephants. We found a circadian variation in urinary noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), adrenaline (epinephrine, <e>Epi</e>) and dopamine (DA) under short day length. Peak activity of noradrenaline and dopamine was noted at 3 a.m. Adrenaline showed a biphasic pattern with a minor peak recorded at 3 a.m. and a major peak 9 a.m. Under long-day photoperiodic conditions, simultaneous peaks of noradrenaline and adrenaline were again noted at 3 a.m. whereas dopamine does not appear to have a distinct circadian pattern under long-day length. A transfer of two elephant cows resulted in a marked increase in urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, confirming that the transfer represented a stressful event. During the peripartal period, noradrenaline concentrations increased and maximum concentrations were obtained at delivery. Daily measurements of urinary dopamine throughout the follicular phase revealed an increase in dopamine secretion close to ovulation. This increase might indicate a role of dopamine in the ovulatory mechanisms. These results suggest that changes in urinary catecholamine excretion reflect fluctuations in sympathoadrenal activity and may be a useful indicator of stress.",M1
17313283,"Stress hormones, effort sense, and perceptions of stress during incremental exercise: an exploratory investigation.Exercise elicits intensity-dependent increases in epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (CORT), and lactate (Lac), whereas at rest the hormonal responses to mental stress include increases in Epi, NE, and CORT, but not Lac. Additionally, elevations in CORT at rest are associated with negative affect. Finally, as exercise intensity increases, perceptions of effort (RPE) increase and affect becomes more negative. The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of Epi, NE, CORT, Lac, RPE, and affect during incremental increases in exercise to maximum. Seven highly-trained male runners completed a discontinuous treadmill protocol that included 10 minutes at 60%, 10 minutes at 75%, 5 minutes at 90%, and 2 minutes at 100% of VO2max. Blood samples were collected through an intravenous catheter before, during, and following exercise during the experimental condition, and during a time-matched control condition. RPE and affect were assessed just prior to each blood draw. The Epi, NE, CORT, and Lac displayed the expected incremental increases, however affect became more negative at higher exercise intensities, and RPE increased as exercise intensity increased. Data suggest that CORT follows the same pattern of response to graded exercise as affect. Since perceptual and affective responses to exercise are associated with motivation, these documented negative affective shifts during exercise should be considered in order to develop strategies that lead to enhanced exercise adherence and performance.",M1
17255468,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated transcriptional regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 expression in neuronal cells.Relatively small changes in G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 3 expression (approximately 2-fold) profoundly affect alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR) function and preferentially regulate neuronal alpha2A- and alpha2B-AR signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>)-induced up-regulation of GRK3 protein expression in two neuronal cell lines, BE(2)-C cells (endogenously express alpha2A- and beta2AR) and BN17 cells [endogenously express alpha2B (NG108) and transfected to express beta2-AR] is due in part to increased GRK3 gene expression. In both cell lines, the increase in GRK3 transcription occurred via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2-dependent mechanism because the increase in GRK3 mRNA is eliminated in the presence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor, U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (2-amino phenylthiobutadiene)]. EPI-induced GRK3 mRNA up-regulation also is prevented in the presence of propranolol or phentolamine. Moreover, GRK3 mRNA did not increase in response to EPI treatment in NG108 cells (endogenously express alpha2B-AR with no beta2-AR). Both these results suggest that simultaneous activation of alpha2- and beta2-AR by EPI is required for the ERK1/2-dependent increase in GRK3 mRNA. The EPI-induced increase in GRK3 mRNA was unaffected in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride. Finally, EPI treatment resulted in increased nuclear translocation and accumulation of the transcription factors, Sp-1 and Ap-2, in BE(2)-C cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate the involvement of the ERK1/2 pathway in selective up-regulation of GRK3 mRNA expression, possibly via activation of Sp-1 and Ap-2 transcription factors in neuronal cells.",M1
17220005,"The effect of serotonin on epinephrine modulation of transepithelial ion transport in isolated frog skin.The aim of this study was to examine the effect of serotonin and epinephrine on ion transport of isolated frog skin. The addition of serotonin after incubation in Ringer solution (RH), bumetanide (BUME), and after initial incubation in amiloride and subsequently in RH, reduced hyperpolarization and did not effect the mechanosensitivity of frog skin. Following incubation of the frog skin with amiloride (AMI), serotonin did not affect the value of hyperpolarization and increased mechanosensitivity. The addition of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) on frog skin incubated in RH and AMI did not affect hyperpolarization, but repeated application of this compound after serotonin increased hyperpolarization. After incubation with bumetanide, addition of EPI before and after application of serotonin did not affect the value of the examined parameters of the frog skin. Initial incubation with AMI and later in RH caused a drop in reaction to EPI and no effect on mechanosensitivity. Repeated addition of epinephrine in this group did not affect the reaction value, while it decreased the reaction value during mechanical stimulation. The experimental data presented in this study indicate that serotonin inhibits the sodium ion current. Epinephrine inhibits the chloride ion current, however, after the application of serotonin, EPI stimulates sodium ion transport.",M1
17218964,"Effects of sympathetic stimulation during cooling on hypothermic as well as posthypothermic hemodynamic function.This experimental study was performed to explore hemodynamic effects of a moderate dose epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) during hypothermia and to test the hypothesis whether sympathetic stimulation during cooling affects myocardial function following rewarming. Two groups of male Wistar rats (each, n=7) were cooled to 15 degrees C, maintained at this temperature for 1 h, and then rewarmed. Group 1 received 1 microg/min Epi, i.v., for 1 h during cooling to 28 degrees C, a dose known to elevate cardiac output (CO) by approximately 25% at 37 degrees C. Group 2 served a saline solution control. At 37 degrees C, Epi infusion elevated CO, left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum rate of left ventricle pressure rise, and mean arterial pressure. During cooling to 28 degrees C, these variables, with the exception of mean arterial pressure, decreased in parallel to those in the saline solution group. In contrast, in the Epi group, mean arterial pressure remained increased and total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated at 28 degrees C. Compared with corresponding prehypothermic values, most hemodynamic variables were lowered after 1 h at 15 degrees C in both groups (except for stroke volume). After rewarming, alterations in hemodynamic variables in the Epi-treated group were more prominent than in saline solution controls. Thus, before cooling, continuous Epi infusion predominantly stimulates myocardial mechanical function, materialized as elevation of CO, left ventricular systolic pressure, and maximum rate of left ventricle pressure rise. Cooling, on the other hand, apparently eradicates central hemodynamic effects of Epi and during stable hypothermia, elevation of peripheral vascular vasopressor effects seem to take over. In contrast to temperature-matched, non-Epi stimulated control rats, a significant depression of myocardial mechanical function occurs during rewarming following a moderate sympathetic stimulus during initial cooling.",M1
17177590,"Cardiovascular effects of felypressin.Cardiovascular effects of felypressin (FEL) were studied in Wistar rats. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure measurements were taken in awake rats treated with vasopressin (AVP), FEL, or epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>). Each group received either an intravenous (IV) or an intracerebroventricular V1 receptor antagonist, saline, area postrema removal, or sham surgery. Analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls (P &lt; .05) were applied. Felypressin and AVP induced a pressor effect, and bradycardia was inhibited by IV V1 antagonist. Intracerebroventricular V1 antagonist and area postrema removal enhanced their pressor effects. Epinephrine induced a higher pressor effect and a similar bradycardia that was not affected by the treatments. It was concluded that FEL depends on V1 receptors to induce pressor and bradycardic effects, and that it produces a high relationship between bradycardia and mean arterial pressure variation depending on area postrema and central V1 receptors. These effects are potentially less harmful to the cardiovascular system than the effects of EPI.",M1
17129610,"Experimentally induced aggressiveness in heroin-dependent patients treated with buprenorphine: comparison of patients receiving methadone and healthy subjects.Objective measures of experimentally induced aggressiveness were evaluated in heroin-dependent patients (HDP), 15 receiving buprenorphine (BUP) and 15 receiving methadone (METH) treatment. HDP were randomly assigned to BUP and METH groups. Fifteen healthy subjects (CONT) were included in the study as controls. During a laboratory task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm, subjects earned monetary reinforcement and could respond by ostensibly subtracting money from a fictitious subject (the aggressive response). Money-earning (points maintained) responses did not differ in BUP patients and in controls. In contrast, point-maintained responses were significantly lower in the group of HDP treated with METH than in both the BUP and CONT groups. Aggressive responses were significantly higher in the HDP group than in the CONT group. No significant differences in aggressive responses were found between the BUP and METH groups. Baseline concentrations of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) were higher in HDP than in CONT. During the experimental task, ACTH and CORT increased significantly less in METH patients than in BUP patients and CONT. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) levels increased significantly more in HDP than in CONT, without any difference between the METH and BUP patients. PSAP aggressive responses positively correlated with NE and EPI changes, as well as with Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) scores in both METH and BUP patients and also in CONT subjects. No correlation was found between the extent of heroin exposure, drug doses and aggressiveness levels. BUP, similarly to METH, does not seem to affect outward-directed aggressiveness, as aggressive responses related more to monoamine levels and personality traits than to the action of opioid agonists. Money-earning responses seemed to be unimpaired in BUP patients.",M1
17085378,"Vasoactive biomarkers and oxidative stress in healthy recently postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement therapy.BACKGROUND: Despite biologically plausible mechanisms for cardiac protection from estrogen therapy, recent clinical trials have suggested possible cardiovascular risk rather than benefit. However, it has been speculated that cardioprotective benefits from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be more evident in the early postmenopausal period. We have previously reported early beneficial effects on biochemical markers of endothelial function in healthy women after short-term estradiol replacement therapy. In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term HRT on different vasoactive factors and oxidative stress in healthy recently postmenopausal women. METHODS: Fifteen women (age 50 +/- 1 years, time since menopause 1.6 +/- 0.1 years) were randomized to a sequential oral and transdermal estradiol regimen (2 mg oral micronized 17beta-estradiol/day or 1.5 mg 17beta-estradiol gel/day). Oral dydrogesterone (10 mg/day, 12 days/month) was then cyclically combined with either of the estrogen therapies for 1 year. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 1, 2, 6 and 12 months of therapy to evaluate levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, 6-keto PGF1alpha (prostacyclin metabolite), nitrite/nitrate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, 8-isoprostane (8-<e>epi</e> PGF2alpha) and lipid profile values. RESULTS: FSH levels decreased (p &lt; 0.001) while estradiol levels increased (p &lt; 0.001) during HRT. Levels of epinephrine (p &lt; 0.001), norepinephrine (p &lt; 0.01), mean blood pressure (p &lt; 0.01) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p &lt; 0.01) decreased, and nitrite/nitrate levels increased (p &lt; 0.01) during HRT, which did not significantly affect 8-epi PGF2alpha levels. CONCLUSIONS: One-year HRT significantly reduced the levels of catecholamines, mean blood pressure and LDL cholesterol while it increased levels of nitrite/nitrate, indicating cardiovascular benefit in healthy recent postmenopausal women. Levels of 8-epi PGF2alpha did not change, suggesting no evident relationship between HRT and oxidative stress.",M1
16959907,"Anticipatory responses of catecholamines on muscle force production.Few data exist on the temporal relationship between catecholamines and muscle force production in vivo. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of preexercise arousal on sympathoadrenal neurohormones on muscular force expression during resistance exercise. Ten resistance-trained men completed two experimental conditions separated by 7 days: 1) acute heavy resistance exercise protocol (AHREP; 6 x 10 repetitions parallel squats, 80% 1 repetition maximum) and 2) control (Cont; rest). Peak force (F(peak)) was recorded during a maximal isometric squat preceding each set and mean force (F(mean)) was measured during each set. Serial venous blood samples were collected before the AHREP and immediately preceding each set. Blood collection times were matched during Cont. Preexercise epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) increased (P &lt;or= 0.05) above Cont by 270, 255, and 164%, respectively. During exercise, Epi, NE, and DA continued to increase by 512, 271, and 38%, respectively, above preexercise values. F(peak) and F(mean) decreased by approximately 20-25% over the course of the AHREP. Post hoc data analysis revealed that five subjects (F(maintainers)) showed no decline (P &gt;or= 0.05) in muscular performance (F(peak), F(mean)) during AHREP and that five subjects (F(reducers)) had significant reductions in F(peak) and F(mean). Integrated area under the curve for Epi, NE, and F(peak) were greater (P &lt; 0.02) for F(maintainers) than F(reducers). In conclusion, an anticipatory rise in catecholamines existed, which may be essential for optimal force production at the onset of exercise.",M1
16938592,"A comparison of transoesophageal cardiac pacing and epinephrine for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.The use of cardiac pacing to deal with bradycardia is well established. There is debate as to the benefits during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study was performed to compare the effects of transoesophageal cardiac pacing and high-dose epinephrine on the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after asphyxial cardiac arrest in rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were randomly selected to a saline group (Sal-gro, treated with normal saline 1 mL IV, n = 10), an epinephrine group (<e>Epi</e>-gro, treated with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg IV, n = 10), or a pacing group (Pac-gro, treated with normal saline 1 mL IV combined with transoesophageal cardiac pacing, n = 10) in a blinded fashion during resuscitation after 10 minutes of asphyxial cardiac arrest. Manual chest compression was in all cases performed using the same methodology by the same personnel who was blinded to hemodynamic monitor tracings. The rate of restoration of spontaneous circulation was 1 (10%), 7 (70%), and 8 (80%) of 10 in Sal-gro, Epi-gro, and Pac-gro, respectively. The rate of ventilator withdrawal within 60 minutes after resuscitation in Pac-gro was higher than that of Epi-gro (8/8 vs 1/7, respectively; P = .001); the survival rate after 2 hours in Pac-gro was significantly higher than that in Epi-gro (7/8 vs 1/7, respectively; P = .01). The data demonstrate that both epinephrine and transoesophageal cardiac pacing are effective within 10 minutes of asphyxia in rats. It is worth noting that transoesophageal cardiac pacing produced a better outcome with respiration and longer survival time compared with epinephrine after restoration of spontaneous circulation.",M1
16713504,"Ethanol consumption increases rat stress hormones and adrenomedullary gene expression.Numerous reports document altered drinking behavior following acute stressors but few describe physiological responses to acute stress of chronic ethanol consuming subjects. We tested rats' responses to 120-min foot restraint immobilization (Immo) after 1 week of liquid diet containing 5% wt/vol ethanol (ethanol-fed). Controls consumed isocaloric liquid diet ad libitum (adlib-fed) or in amounts equal to that of ethanol-fed subjects on the previous day (pair-fed). Each rat was implanted with a tail artery cannula on day 7 to allow remote blood collection before and during Immo on day 8. Plasma epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>); norepinephrine (NE); corticosterone (Cort); prolactin (PRL); adrenomedullary gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT); and TH protein levels were measured. Ethanol-fed rats had two to threefold higher basal plasma Epi and NE and tended to have increased Cort compared to adlib-fed or pair-fed rats. Immo increased Epi and NE in ethanol-fed rats more than twofold above those observed in controls, and also increased Cort more in ethanol-fed than in control rats. PRL was marginally affected. Ethanol potentiated the normal immobilization-induced increase in adrenomedullary TH, DBH, and PNMT messenger RNA (mRNA). TH protein increased only in ethanol-fed rats. Increased plasma catecholamine levels, adrenomedullary gene expression, and TH protein concentration in nonimmobilized ethanol-fed rats strongly suggest that ethanol consumption was itself a stressor, which potentiated the subsequent response to acute Immo. Moreover, the observed interaction of ethanol and stress on plasma catecholamine levels illustrates the importance of minimizing additional stressful stimuli when investigating ethanol's physiological effects.",M1
16703551,"Comparison of the effect of Healon, Healon GV, Healon 5, Viscoat, and Ocucoat on platelet aggregation under in vitro conditions.PURPOSE: To study the effect of Healon, Healon GV, Healon 5, Viscoat, and OcuCoat on platelet aggregation under in vitro conditions. METHODS: Ocular viscoelastic devices including Healon, Healon GV, Healon 5, Viscoat, and OcuCoat were studied to investigate the effect of these agents on platelet aggregation under in vitro conditions. The experiments were performed by using platelet-rich plasma with an aggregometer. Aggregation was induced with three different agonists including 5''-adeno-sinediphosphate (ADP), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), and collagen (Col ). The results were obtained as a percentage of maximal aggregation and compared with controls using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. RESULTS: The tests with ADP as aggregating agent revealed that the percentages of maximal aggregation were a mean of 75 +/- 4.35% for ADP only, 67 +/- 4.35% for Healon, 59.33 +/- 3.51% for Healon GV, 70 +/- 3% for Healon 5, 58 +/- 3.46% for Viscoat, and 64 +/- 2% for OcuCoat. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test revealed no significant decrease in the percentage of maximal aggregation for all tested substances. With EPI, aggregation was induced in all control samples with a mean of 80.66 +/- 2.08%. The mean percentage of maximal aggregation was 67 +/- 3% for Healon, 77.66 +/- 4.04% for Healon GV, 77 +/- 4% for Healon 5, 80.6 +/- 4.04% for Viscoat, and 65 +/- 5% for OcuCoat. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference. With collagen, maximum aggregation was 74 +/- 5.29% for controls, 65 +/- 4.35% for Healon, 54 +/- 2% for Healon GV, 51 +/- 2.64% for Healon 5, 59 +/- 2% for Viscoat, and 72.66 +/- 1.52% for OcuCoat. Kruskal -Wallis one-way ANOVA test revealed no significant change in the percentage of maximal aggregation for all tested substances in the experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices like Healon, Healon GV, Healon 5, and Viscoat that contain glycosaminoglycans and OcuCoat that contains hydroxypropyl methylcellulose have inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation but the effect is not statistically significant and there is no difference among the ocular viscoelastic devices in regard to inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.",M1
16691441,"Gene expression of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice during stress exposure.1. AIMS: Epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, EC 2.1.1.28) is primarily localized in the adrenal medulla (AM). We have recently described existence of the PNMT gene expression in cardiac atria and ventricles and in sympathetic ganglia of adult rats and mice. The aim of the present work was to study regulation of the PNMT gene expression in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice (CRH KO) and matched control wild-type mice (WT) under normal and stress conditions. 2. METHODS: Levels of the PNMT mRNA were determined by RT-PCR; PNMT immunoprotein and protein of transcription factor EGR-1 by Western Blot. Plasma EPI and corticosterone (CORT) levels were determined by radioenzymatic and RIA methods. Immobilization (IMMO) was used as a stressor. 3. RESULTS: Stress-induced increases in the PNMT mRNA and protein levels observed in WT mice were almost completely absent in CRH KO mouse adrenal medulla, stellate ganglia, and cardiac atria, while ventricular PNMT mRNA elevation was not CRH-dependent. Plasma EPI and CORT levels were markedly reduced in CRH KO compared to WT mice both before and after the stress. Levels of EGR-1, crucial transcription factor for regulation of the PNMT were highly increased in stressed WT and CRH KO mice in cardiac areas, but not in the adrenal medulla. 4. CONCLUSIONS: Data show that the CRH deficiency can markedly prevent immobilization-triggered induction of the PNMT mRNA and protein levels in the adrenal medulla and stellate ganglia. Reduced plasma epinephrine and corticosterone levels and adrenal medullary EGR-1 protein levels in CRH knockout versus WT mice during stress indicate that the HPA axis plays a crucial role in regulation of the PNMT gene expression in these organs. Cardiac atrial PNMT gene expression with stress is also dependent on intact HPA axis. However, in cardiac ventricles, especially after the single stress exposure, its expression is not impaired by CRH deficiency. Since cardiac EGR-1 protein levels in CRH KO mice are also not affected by the single stress exposure, we propose existence of different regulation of the PNMT gene expression, especially in the cardiac ventricles.Overall, our findings reveal that the PNMT gene expression is regulated through the HPA in both sympathoadrenal system and the heart and also via EGR-1 in the adrenal medulla, but apparently not in the heart. Regulation of the PNMT gene expression in various compartments of heart includes both corticosterone-dependent and independent mechanisms.",M1
16690773,"Adrenergic regulation of HSL serine phosphorylation and activity in human skeletal muscle during the onset of exercise.Skeletal muscle hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity is increased by contractions and increases in blood epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) concentrations and cyclic AMP activation of the adrenergic pathway during prolonged exercise. To determine the importance of hormonal stimulation of HSL activity during the onset of moderate- and high-intensity exercise, nine men [age 24.3 +/- 1.2 yr, 80.8 +/- 5.0 kg, peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) 43.9 +/- 3.6 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)] cycled for 1 min at approximately 65% VO2 peak, rested for 60 min, and cycled at approximately 90% VO2 peak for 1 min. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken pre- and postexercise, and arterial blood was sampled throughout exercise. Arterial EPI increased (P &lt; 0.05) postexercise at 65% (0.45 +/- 0.10 to 0.78 +/- 0.27 nM) and 90% VO2 peak (0.57 +/- 0.34 to 1.09 +/- 0.50 nM). HSL activity increased (P &lt; 0.05) following 1 min of exercise at 65% VO2 peak [1.05 +/- 0.39 to 1.78 +/- 0.54 mmol x min(-1) x kg dry muscle (dm)(-1)] and 90% VO2 peak (1.07 +/- 0.24 to 1.91 +/- 0.62 mmol x min(-1) x kg dm(-1)). Cyclic AMP content also increased (P &lt; 0.05) at both exercise intensities (65%: 1.52 +/- 0.67 to 2.75 +/- 1.12, 90%: 1.85 +/- 0.65 to 2.64 +/- 0.93 micromol/kg dm). HSL Ser660 phosphorylation (approximately 55% increase) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation ( approximately 33% increase) were augmented following exercise at both intensities, whereas HSL Ser563 and Ser565 phosphorylation were not different from rest. The results indicate that increases in arterial EPI concentration during the onset of moderate- and high-intensity exercise increase cyclic AMP content, which results in the phosphorylation of HSL Ser660. This adrenergic stimulation contributes to the increase in HSL activity that occurs in human skeletal muscle in the first minute of exercise at 65% and 90% VO2 peak.",M1
16597482,"Application of normothermic cardiac arrest algorithms to hypothermic cardiac arrest in a canine model.BACKGROUND: International guidelines (2000) do not recommend vasopressor and antiarrhythmic medications during ventricular fibrillation (VF) with a core temperature below 30 degrees C. The efficacy of normothermic AHA algorithms using standard doses of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) (adrenaline) followed by amiodarone (AMIO) in hypothermic VF is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of EPI followed by the combination of EPI/AMIO in the treatment of VF in a canine model of severe hypothermia. METHODS: An un-blinded, placebo controlled experiment using 21 mechanically ventilated dogs. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), temperature, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored. Animals were cooled to 22 degrees C or the onset of spontaneous VF. VF was induced if necessary. Animals in the treatment group received EPI (0.01 mg/kg IV) and defibrillation. This was followed by EPI (0.01 mg/kg IV), AMIO (10 mg/kg IV) and defibrillation if there was no sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for 15 min. RESULTS: Mean CPP in the treatment group increased after the administration of EPI/AMIO (24.7+/-13.3 mmHg to 46.6+/-7.7 mmHg, p&lt;0.004). Cumulatively, the administration of EPI followed by EPI/AMIO achieved ROSC after defibrillation in 10 of 11 animals compared to 3 of 10 in the control group (91% versus 30%, n=21, p=0.0075). CONCLUSIONS: In this model of severe hypothermia, the use of standard 2000 protocols for VF resulted in a significant increase of CPP, and, a higher ROSC rate compared to placebo controls. This study suggests that AHA normothermic algorithms may be beneficial in severe hypothermia.",M1
16583134,"Enhanced beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain and pancreas during pancreatic regeneration in weanling rats.Adrenergic stimulation has an important role in the pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. In the present study, we have investigated how sympathetic system regulates the pancreatic regeneration by analyzing Epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), Norepinephrine (NE) and beta-adrenergic receptor changes in the brain as well as in the pancreas. EPI and NE showed a significant decrease in the brain regions, pancreas and plasma at 72 hrs after partial pancreatectomy. We observed an increase in the circulating insulin levels at 72 hrs. Scatchard analysis using [(3)H] propranolol showed a significant increase in the number of both the low affinity and high affinity beta-adrenergic receptors in cerebral cortex and hypothalamus of partially pancreatectomised rats during peak DNA synthesis. The affinity of the receptors decreased significantly in the low and high affinity receptors of cerebral cortex and the high affinity hypothalamic receptors. In the brain stem, low affinity receptors were increased significantly during regeneration whereas there was no change in the high affinity receptors. The pancreatic beta-adrenergic receptors were also up regulated at 72 hrs after partial pancreatectomy. In vitro studies showed that beta-adrenergic receptors are positive regulators of islet cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Thus our results suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptors are functionally enhanced during pancreatic regeneration, which in turn increases pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and insulin secretion in weanling rats.",M1
16533872,"Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 3 and GRK2 in down-regulation of the alpha2B-adrenoceptor.Increasing the cellular levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 or GRK3 renders the alpha2B-adrenoceptor (AR) more sensitive to agonist-induced down-regulation (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 312:767-773, 2005). However, an absolute requirement of GRK3 and GRK2 for alpha2B-AR down-regulation is controversial. In this study, using NG108 cells (endogenous alpha2B-AR), we provide strong evidence for a critical role of both GRK3 and GRK2 in down-regulation of the alpha2B-AR. Pretreatment of NG108 cells with 20 microM epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) begins down-regulating the alpha2B-AR by 2 h. The translocation of GRK3 and GRK2 to the membrane peaks at 30 min, decreasing by 1 h. Although these results may implicate GRK3 and GRK2 in alpha2B-AR down-regulation, significant receptor down-regulation is not observed until 2 h, after GRK3 and GRK2 translocation has peaked and is declining. To more directly establish a role for GRK3 and GRK2 in alpha2B-AR down-regulation, NG108 cells were transfected to express GRK3ct, which binds to liberated Gbetagamma subunits, preventing GRK3 and GRK2 translocation to the membrane. Overexpression of GRK3ct prevented not only the translocation of GRK3 and GRK2 but also the down-regulation of the alpha2B-AR caused by 24-h pretreatment with 20 microM EPI. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence for a role of GRK3 and GRK2 in the down-regulation of the alpha2B-AR and contribute significantly to the increasing evidence in the literature for a pivotal role of GRKs in modulating the agonist-induced down-regulation of the alpha2-AR.",M1
16497365,"The association of serum leptin with the reduction of food intake and body weight during electroacupuncture in rats.Previous studies indicate that acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) treatment reduces body weight and food intake in rats by increasing the level of anoretic peptides and decreasing that of orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. Considering a well-established role of leptin as a major regulator for feeding behavior in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that EA might exert its effect via increasing serum leptin levels. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effects of EA on food intake and body weight, as well as on serum leptin levels in rats. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: AL (fed ad libitum with no treatments), Holder (fed ad libitum with daily holder restraint) and EA (fed ad libitum with daily holder restraint and 100 Hz EA stimulation) groups. During the four-week experimental period, daily food intake and body weight were measured. At the end of the experiment, levels of serum leptin and corticosterone, and plasma epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) and norepinephrine (NE) were determined. Here we demonstrate that EA treatment indeed led to reduction of food intake and body weight, and to an increase of serum leptin levels. The level of Epi, NE, and corticosterone increased in the Holder group, but such increase in the level of aforementioned stress hormones was not observed in the EA group. Overall, our results suggest that EA treatment reduces food intake and body weight in rats possibly through increasing leptin levels, and that this effect of EA is not due to the stress caused by the daily holder restraint.",M1
16374277,"The impact of a hypercatecholamine state on erythropoiesis following severe injury and the role of IL-6.BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic injury can lead to hemorrhagic shock-induced bone marrow (BM) dysfunction resulting in persistent anemia. The hypercatacholamine state that accompanies severe injury has been shown to impact the growth of erythroid progenitors. IL-6 has a role both in the acute phase response of trauma and has been implicated in the development of anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the severity of a hyper-adrenergic stimulus on pluripotent progenitors (GEMM-CFU) as well as erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) and the potential regulatory role of IL-6. METHODS: Normal human BM mononuclear cells were isolated and erythropoiesis was assessed by the growth of GEMM-CFU, BFU-E and CFU-E in the presence of adrenergic agonists, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), at increasing concentrations. Similarly, normal BM stroma cells were grown to confluence then incubated with NE and EPI. Supernatant was harvested and IL-6 levels were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Under physiologic conditions (10(-7) M), NE and EPI increase BFU-E and CFU-E growth (374% and 177% versus 100% control). At severe stress levels (10(-3) M), NE and EPI completely inhibited BFU-E and CFU-E growth (5% and 4% versus 100% control). GEMM-CFU growth was increased by NE and not EPI at 10(-7) M. The presence of NE and EPI increased IL-6 levels in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: The proliferative effect of adrenergic agonists at physiologic levels on normal erythropoiesis begins early during erythroid differentiation. At severe stress levels, BFU-E and CFU-E growth is inhibited. The erythropoietic dysfunction and resultant anemia seen following severe injury may be due to the presence of a severe hypercatecholamine state and may be mediated by IL-6.",M1
16231455,"Effect of space flight and head-down bedrest on neuroendocrine response to metabolic stress in physically trained subjects.The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and norepinephrine (NE) responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia (ITT) 3 weeks before the space flight (SF), on the 5th day of SF, on the 2nd and 16th days after the landing in the first Slovak astronaut, and before and on the 5th day of prolonged subsequent head-down (-6 degrees) bed rest (BR) in 15 military aircraft pilots. Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",M1
16222052,"Norepinephrine- and epinephrine-deficient mice gain weight normally on a high-fat diet.OBJECTIVE: Signaling through adrenergic receptors (ARs) by norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) regulates weight gain when mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) by controlling diet-induced thermogenesis. Thus, one would predict that mice unable to make NE/Epi because of inactivation of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (Dbh-null mice) would have a propensity to become obese. We characterized the response of Dbh-null and control mice to a HFD. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Dbh-null and control mice were fed an HFD or a regular diet (RD) for 2 months. Body weight, adiposity, muscle triglyceride levels, and adipocyte size were measured, as were circulating leptin, adiponectin, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels. A glucose tolerance test was also preformed. RESULTS: Dbh-null mice gain weight normally on an HFD and have the same adiposity. Their serum triglyceride and leptin levels are normal, but adipocytes are approximately 30% smaller than controls. Dbh-null mice maintain low blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance when exposed to the HFD in contrast to controls. DISCUSSION: Complete lack of NE/Epi does not predispose to obesity. Because mice lacking all three betaARs become obese on an HFD, an imbalance of signaling through alpha- and betaARs seems to be responsible for obesity. Surprisingly, Dbh-null mice maintain glucose tolerance.",M1
16210439,"Cardiovascular effects of epinephrine during rewarming from hypothermia in an intact animal model.Rewarming from accidental hypothermia is often complicated by  rewarming shock,  characterized by low cardiac output (CO) and a sudden fall in peripheral arterial pressure. In this study, we tested whether epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) is able to prevent rewarming shock when given intravenously during rewarming from experimental hypothermia in doses tested to elevate CO and induce vasodilation, or lack of vasodilation, during normothermia. A rat model designed for circulatory studies during experimental hypothermia and rewarming was used. A total of six groups of animals were used: normothermic groups 1, 2, and 3 for dose-finding studies, and hypothermic groups 4, 5, and 6. At 20 and 24 degrees C during rewarming, group 4 (low-dose Epi) and group 5 (high-dose Epi) received bolus injections of 0.1 and 1.0 microg Epi, respectively. At 28 degrees C, Epi infusion was started in groups 4 and 5 with 0.125 and 1.25 microg/min, respectively. Group 6 served as saline control. After rewarming, both CO and stroke volume were restored in group 4, in contrast to groups 5 and 6, in which both CO and stroke volume remained significantly reduced (30%). Total peripheral resistance was significantly higher in group 5 during rewarming from 24 to 34 degrees C, compared with groups 4 and 6. This study shows that, in contrast to normothermic conditions, Epi infused during hypothermia induces vasoconstriction rather than vasodilation combined with lack of CO elevation. The apparent dissociation between myocardial and vascular responses to Epi at low temperatures may be related to hypothermia-induced myocardial failure and changes in temperature-dependent adrenoreceptor affinity.",M1
16163519,"Effects of dopamine beta-hydroxylase genotype and disulfiram inhibition on catecholamine homeostasis in mice.RATIONALE: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) converts dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE), thus playing a critical role in catecholamine metabolism. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We examined the effects of Dbh gene dosage and the DBH inhibitor disulfiram in mice with zero, one, or two null Dbh alleles (+/+, +/-, and-/- mice). RESULTS: DBH protein levels in adrenal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and adrenal DBH activity were proportional to number of wild-type alleles. Adrenal DA was slightly increased in+/- mice and markedly increased (80-fold) in -/- mice compared to wild-type animals. While adrenal NE and epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) were undetectable in -/- mice, adrenal concentrations of NE and EPI were similar in +/+ and +/- mice, suggesting that the increase in DA maintains the normal rate of beta-hydroxylation in Dbh +/- mice. Disulfiram had little effect on adrenal catecholamine levels, regardless of genotype or dose. NE was absent in the PFC of -/- mice, but only slightly reduced in +/- animals compared to wild-type animals. PFC DA was increased twofold in +/- mice and fivefold in -/- mice, and the NE to DA ratio was reduced ( approximately 35%) in +/- mice, compared to wild-type mice. Disulfiram significantly decreased PFC NE and increased DA in +/+ and +/- animals, with the disulfiram and genotype effects on the PFC NE to DA ratio apparently additive. CONCLUSIONS: The data reveal potentially important and apparently additive effects of Dbh genotype and disulfiram administration on PFC catecholamine metabolism. These effects may have implications for genetic control of DBH activity in humans and for understanding therapeutic effects of disulfiram.",M1
16076033,"Influence of catecholamines on cytokine production and expression of adhesion molecules of human neutrophils in vitro.The impact of catecholamines on cytokine production and expression of adhesion molecules by human neutrophils was evaluated in vitro. Neutrophils were separated from venous blood of healthy subjects. The generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and Ca2+ was determined after incubation with catecholamines. Resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated neutrophils were tested for synthesis of interleukins (IL-6, IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, the expression of the adhesion molecules CD15, CD44, and CD54 was evaluated in resting and activated neutrophils. Increasing concentrations (1 nM-1 mM) of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) were used to study the influence of activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2R) on cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression. Incubation with catecholamines induced an increase in cAMP but not Ca2+ in neutrophils. Only IL-8 was detected following stimulation with LPS and was unchanged upon co-incubation with EPI. The expression of CD15 and CD44 decreased spontaneously in vitro. The density of CD44 increased in the presence of very high doses of EPI (1 mM). Expression of CD54 on resting neutrophils increased upon activation. The density of CD54 on activated neutrophils was reduced upon co-incubation with 1 mM EPI for 6 h. However, 1 mM EPI for 12 and 18 h decreased the spontaneous loss of CD54 on resting neutrophils. Beta2R are functionally coupled to signalling cascades in human neutrophils. Nevertheless, the impact of catecholamines on IL-8 synthesis and expression of CD15, CD44, and CD54 is limited.",M1
16026927,"Contribution of catechol O-methyltransferase to the removal of accumulated interstitial catecholamines evoked by myocardial ischemia.Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays an important role for clearance of high catecholamine levels. Although myocardial ischemia evokes similar excessive catecholamine accumulation, it is uncertain whether COMT activity is involved in the removal of accumulated catecholamines evoked by myocardial ischemia. We examined how COMT activity affects myocardial catecholamine levels during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. We implanted a dialysis probe into the left ventricular myocardial free wall and measured dialysate catecholamines levels in anesthetized rabbits. Dialysate catecholamine levels served as an index of myocardial interstitial catecholamine levels. We introduced myocardial ischemia by 60 min occlusion of the main coronary artery. The ischemia-induced dialysate catecholamines levels were compared with and without the pretreatment with entacapone (COMT inhibitor, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Acute myocardial ischemia progressively increased dialysate catecholamine levels. Acute myocardial ischemia increased dialysate norepinephrine (NE) levels (20,453+/-7186 pg/ml), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) levels (1724+/-706 pg/ml), and dopamine (DA) levels (1807+/-800 pg/ml) at the last 15 min of coronary occlusion. Inhibition of COMT activity by entacapone augmented the ischemia-induced NE levels (54,306+/-6618 pg/ml), EPI levels (2681+/-567 pg/ml), and DA (3551+/-710 pg/ml) levels at the last 15 min of coronary occlusion. Myocardial ischemia evoked NE, EPI, and DA accumulation in the myocardial interstitial space. The inhibition of COMT activity augmented these increments in NE, EPI, and DA. These data suggest that cardiac COMT activity influences on the removal of accumulated catecholamine during myocardial ischemia.",M1
16022583,"Beta2-adrenergic receptors mediate the differential effects of catecholamines on cytokine production of PBMC.We determined characteristics of beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2R) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cytokine production after mitogenic stimulation and coincubation with catecholamines. PBMCs were stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), tetanus toxoid (TT), anti-CD3 antibody, or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4, and IL-6 were determined by ELISA following coincubation with high-dose (10(-5) M) and low-dose (10(-9) M) epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and norepinephrine (NE). Intracellular IFN-gamma and IL-4 were studied by FACS analysis. The beta2R density was investigated using a radioligand binding assay. The stimuli induced various cytokine profiles in PBMCs. Synthesis of IFN-gamma was induced by all mitogens and could be suppressed by catecholamines (26%-85% reduction). In PHA-stimulated PBMCs, IL-4 synthesis was decreased by high-dose catecholamines (24%-28% reduction). Adding a beta-blocking agent attenuated most catecholamine effects. A highly significant negative correlation between the density of beta2R with IFN-gamma and IL-6 levels of PHA-activated PBMCs (r = -0.88 to -0.96, p &lt; 0.01-&lt; 0.001) was observed. The results indicate that the density of beta2R on PBMC plays a role in mediating the differential catecholamine effects on cytokine production of PBMC. Furthermore, changes in cytokine expression induced by catecholamines favor Th2 responses.",M1
16011977,"Assessment of the antiplatelet effects of low to medium dose aspirin in the early and late phases after ischaemic stroke and TIA.Vascular events commonly recur in stroke patients on aspirin, and may reflect incomplete inhibition of platelet function with aspirin therapy. The platelet function analyser (PFA-100) activates platelets by aspirating a blood sample at a moderately high shear rate through a capillary to a biologically active membrane with a central aperture. The membrane is coated with collagen, and either ADP (C-ADP) or epinephrine (C-<e>EPI</e>). The time taken for activated platelets to adhere, aggregate, and occlude the aperture is called the closure time. Previous studies have shown that aspirin prolongs the C-EPI closure time, without prolongation of the C-ADP closure time, in the majority of control subjects. We hypothesised that the PFA-100 would provide a sensitive assay for the detection of early and convalescent phase cerebrovascular disease (CVD) patients who had incomplete inhibition of platelet function with aspirin. We investigated potential cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent mechanisms that might influence the responsiveness to aspirin using the PFA-100. Patients were studied during the early (&lt; or = 4 weeks, n=57) and convalescent phases ((&lt; or = 3 months, n=46) after ischaemic stroke or TIA. To investigate potential mechanisms that could contribute to aspirin responsiveness on the PFA-100, we measured von Willebrand factor antigen levels, and carried out platelet aggregometry experiments in platelet-rich plasma in response to sodium arachidonate (1 mM) and ADP (5 microM). Sixty percent of patients in the early phase and 43% of patients in the convalescent phase did not have prolonged C-EPI closure times on 75-300 mg of aspirin daily, and were defined as aspirin non-responders. Median C-ADP closure times were significantly shorter in aspirin non-responders than aspirin-responders in both the early and convalescent phases after symptom onset (P=0.008), suggesting platelet hyper-reactivity to collagen or ADP in the aspirin non-responder subgroup. There was a significant inverse relationship between plasma von Willebrand factor antigen levels and C-EPI closure times in both early and convalescent phase CVD patients (P=0.008). Mean von Willebrand factor antigen levels were significantly higher in aspirin non-responders than aspirin responsive patients in the early (P=0.001), but not convalescent phase (P=0.2) after stroke and TIA. None of the patients studied were defined as being aspirin-resistant using sodium arachidonate- or ADP-induced platelet aggregometry. A large proportion of ischaemic CVD patients have incomplete inhibition of platelet function with low to medium dose aspirin using the PFA-100. The results suggest that cyclooxygenase-independent mechanisms, including elevated von Willebrand factor antigen levels, play an important role in mediating aspirin non-responsiveness on the PFA-100.",M1
15993822,"Epinephrine-induced excitation and sensitization of rat C-fiber nociceptors.Although epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) has been suggested to contribute to the pain and hyperalgesia associated with inflammation and nerve injury, there have been very few in vivo electrophysiologic studies of the effects of EPI on nociceptors. We found with the single-unit recording technique that the intradermal administration of EPI resulted in excitation of a group of C fibers and a decrease in the mechanical activation threshold in a non-overlapping group. Unexpectedly, the fibers that were neither excited nor demonstrated a decrease in threshold demonstrated as a group a significant increase in response to sustained suprathreshold mechanical stimuli, an effect not observed in the other 2 groups of C fibers. This identifies a novel response of C-fiber nociceptors to an inflammatory mediator and suggests it is present in a class of C fibers previously considered unresponsive to hyperalgesic inflammatory mediators. PERSPECTIVE: Our study provides support for the suggestion that EPI, a neuroendocrine stress hormone as well as an inflammatory mediator, might contribute to pain syndromes, especially in the setting of chronic stress.",M1
15915396,"Cardiovascular responses in patients with acute allergic reactions treated with parenteral epinephrine.The present study describes the cardiovascular responses to epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) given into the arm, in adult patients with acute allergic reactions, and the differential responses to subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration. Sixty-three adult patients were treated with Epi administered SC or IM after H1 and H2 receptor blockade. Heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were then measured for 20 minutes. Changes in heart rate and BP variables were analyzed. Pulse pressure and systolic BP showed increases with time. Diastolic BP also showed a modestly decreasing values over time. Heart rates did not change. Time-related changes between IM and SC Epi treatment were not observed. Sex influenced timed BP values and a significant sex by time effect was observed. In subset analysis, only male patients showed an overall time effect for BP variables, especially pulse pressure. In conclusion, adults with acute allergic syndromes treated with arm-injected Epi show a modest but definite increase in pulse pressure and systolic BP. This pattern is observed more in males. Heart rate and blood pressure differences between IM and SC arm-injected Epi treatments do not appear to be significant.",M1
15848152,"Comparison of agonist-induced Ca2+ responses in rat submandibular acini and ducts.Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) induced by agonists were simultaneously monitored in rat submandibular acini and ducts using a Ca(2+) imaging system. Substance P (SP) elicited marked increases in [Ca(2+)]i in acini but not in ducts. Carbachol (CCh) increased [Ca(2+)]i in both acini and ducts, but the maximal level was higher in acini than in ducts. In contrast, epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) also induced an increase in [Ca(2+)]i in acini and ducts, but to a greater extent in ducts than in acini. Isoproterenol (ISO) caused a small but significant increase in [Ca(2+)]i in ducts but not acini. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using total RNA extracted from highly purified acinar and ductal cells showed that substance P receptor mRNA was present in acini at higher levels than in ducts. In contrast, alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor mRNA was more strongly expressed in ducts than in acini. The muscarinic receptors (M(3) and M(5)) and beta-adrenoceptors (beta(1) and beta(2)) were expressed at equivalent levels in both cell types. These results confirm that acini and ducts exhibit significant differences in agonist-induced Ca(2+) responses. Furthermore, substance P- and epinephrine-induced Ca(2+) responses were consistent with receptor mRNA expression in acini and ducts, but carbachol- and isoproterenol-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases were not.",M1
15784645,"Effects of glycemic control on target organ responses to epinephrine in type 1 diabetes.Severe hypoglycemia occurs in intensively treated patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) due in part to deficient epinephrine counterregulatory responses. Previously, we have found that T1DM patients demonstrated a spectrum of altered responses to epinephrine at a variety of target organs compared with nondiabetic healthy subjects. What is not known is whether intensive glycemic control further modifies target organ responses in individuals with T1DM. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess whether there is tissue specific (liver, muscle, adipose tissue, pancreas and cardiovascular) resistance to epinephrine in intensively controlled (IC) T1DM compared with those with conventional control (CC). Eight IC patients (age 33 +/- 4 yr, BMI 24 +/- 2 kg/m2, Hb A1C 6.7 +/- 0.1%), and 11 CC patients (age 35 +/- 3 yr, BMI 25 +/- 1 kg/m2, Hb A1C 9.6 +/- 0.1%) underwent two separate randomized, single-blind, 2-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies with (<e>EPI</e>) and without (NO EPI) epinephrine infusion. Epinephrine levels during EPI were similar in all groups (5,197 +/- 344 pmol/l). Glucose (5.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) and insulin levels (515 +/- 44 pmol/l) were similar in all groups during the glucose clamps. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and glucose uptake (R(d)) were determined using [3-H3]glucose. Muscle biopsy was performed at the end of each study. IC had a significantly reduced EGP and R(d) responses to EPI compared with CC. Glucagon responses to EPI were similarly blunted in both IC and CC. Free fatty acid and glycerol response to EPI was greater in CC compared with IC. There was a significantly greater systolic blood pressure response to EPI in CC. We conclude that, despite similar epinephrine, insulin, and glucose levels, intensively treated T1DM patients had reduced cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, hepatic, and adipose target organ responses to EPI compared with conventionally treated T1DM patients.",M1
15773668,"Neurohormonal behavior during prolonged orthostatic stress in normotensive subjects.Prolonged orthostatic stress induces major changes in hemodynamic and autonomic nervous system function. The neurohormonal response to acute and prolonged orthostatic stress that may trigger neurocardiogenic syncope is not clear. The goal of this study was to assess neurohormonal changes during acute and prolonged orthostatic stress. In fifteen normotensive subjects without medication blood was sampled at supine rest (S), during early passive orthostatic stress (after first 10 min.) (T1) and after prolonged (&gt;40 min.) orthostatic stress (T2). We measured atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) and catecholamines [norepinephrine (NOR), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and dopamine (DOP)]. ANP was 7.0 +/- 4.3 pmol/l during S, 7.3 +/- 5.1 during T1 and 4.6 +/- 2.8 during T2 (NS and p &lt; 0.05). BNP was 1.9 +/- 1.6 pmol/l during S, 1.7 +/- 1.5 during T1 and 1.4 +/- 1.3 during T2 (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05). NOR was 172 +/- 92 pg/ml during S, 378 +/-_216 during T1 and 402 +/- 183 during T2 (p &lt; 0.01 and NS). EPI was 10.4 +/- 3.8 pg/ml during S, 22.2 +/- 9.3 during T1 and 44.4 +/- 26.0 during T2 (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.01). DOP was 7.8 +/- 4.8 pg/ml, 7.6 +/- 2.1 during T1 and 7.0 +/- 2.3 during T2 (NS and NS), Neurohormonal responses to orthostatic stress varied. Natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) decreased with prolonged orthostatic stress, probably due to the progressive hypovolemia it induced. Dopamine levels did not change, whereas norepinephrine and epinephrine showed a considerable rise following acute orthostatic stress, with epinephrine rising still further with prolonged orthostatic stress. Neurohormonal responses to prolonged orthostatic stress could help to clarify the pathophysiology of neurocardiogenic syncope.",M1
15744130,"Adrenergic modulation of erythropoiesis following severe injury is mediated through bone marrow stroma.BACKGROUND: Severe trauma leads to hematopoietic failure and bone marrow (BM) dysfunction that manifests clinically as a persistent anemia and leukopenia. The impact of severe trauma and its associated hyperadrenergic state on erythropoiesis has not been described. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effects of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on erythropoiesis, both in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) and stroma-depleted BM. METHODS: Urine epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and norepinephrine (NE) excretion from severely injured patients was assessed via enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Erythropoiesis was assessed by the growth of erythroid progenitors-erythroid burst forming units and colony forming units (BFU-E and CFU-E)-in normal human BM in the presence of adrenergic agonists and antagonists at varying concentrations. Parallel cultures, depleted of BM stroma by passage through nylon wool columns, were compared. RESULTS: Urine NE excretion was elevated in all samples from days 1 to 10 following injury (average 139 +/- 59 mcg/day vs. control 35 +/- 9 mcg/day). In vitro doses of NE, EPI, and isoproterenol (ISO) exerted a stimulatory effect on BFU-E colony growth in BMNCs (expressed as percentage of control: 324 +/- 30, 272 +/- 16, 212 +/- 95, vs. 100%), but had no effect on stroma-depleted BM. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial and persistent hyperadrenergic state seen after severe injury that may last for up to a week. Adrenergic agonists have a clear stimulatory effect on the growth of primitive erythroid precursors in normal BM. The adrenergic stimulus appears to be mediated via BM stroma.",M1
15711973,"The haemodynamic and metabolic effects of epinephrine in experimental hyperdynamic septic shock.OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) infusion on vital organ blood flow and metabolic variables during sepsis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised placebo-controlled animal trial in an animal laboratory. ANIMALS: Seven merino cross-ewes. INTERVENTIONS: Chronic implantation of flow probes (aorta, renal, mesenteric and coronary artery and sagittal sinus). Induction of sepsis by intravenous injection of E. coli. Random allocation of sheep to EPI (0.4 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or vehicle for 6 h. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: E. coli induced hypotension and hyperlactataemia and increased cardiac output, renal, mesenteric and coronary blood flows. Compared to vehicle, EPI restored mean arterial blood pressure (69 vs. 86 mmHg) and further increased cardiac output (6.4 vs. 7.1 l/min). EPI, however, decreased renal blood flow (330 vs. 247 ml/min) and renal conductance. EPI also reduced mesenteric and coronary conductance without changes in flows. Compared to vehicle, EPI increased urine output (293 vs. 544 ml/6 h) but not creatinine clearance. EPI increased lactate (1.8 vs. 15.7 mmol/l) with accompanying acidosis (serum bicarbonate: 25.2 vs. 15.7 mmol/l), hyperglycaemia (2.6 vs. 13.5 mmol/l) and hypokalaemia (4.3 vs. 3.0 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperdynamic sepsis increased blood flow to heart, gut and kidney. Although EPI infusion further increased cardiac output, blood pressure and myocardial performance, it was also associated with potent metabolic effects, decreased mesenteric, coronary and renal conductance and a significant reduction in renal blood flow.",M1
15682930,"Beneficial effects of a protein free, high carbohydrate meal on rat coping behavior and neurotransmitter levels during heat stress.This study examined effects of a single protein-free (PROT-free), high carbohydrate meal (0% protein, 82% carbohydrate) or control meal (20% protein, 62% carbohydrate) on coping behavior and neurotransmitter levels of male Fischer 344 rats. Meals varying in protein/carbohydrate ratio differentially affect transport of neurotransmitter precursors into the brain and alter neurotransmission. The meals were studied in animals exposed to heat stress and normothermic control animals. Coping behavior was assessed using the Porsolt swim test (N = 39). In other rats, dopamine (DA), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin in the striatum were assessed using in vivo microdialysis (N = 35). In control-fed rats, heat stress impaired Porsolt performance in comparison to normothermic controls (p &lt;0.05). The PROT-free, high carbohydrate meal protected animals from adverse effects of stress on coping performance as it reduced the effect of heat stress more than 90%. Significant changes in striatal DA and EPI efflux were observed as a consequence of the nutritional manipulation and heat exposure. It is concluded a single PROT-free, high carbohydrate meal improves ability to cope with heat stress and alters neurotransmission. The neurochemical basis for these effects may be a change in DA efflux, although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.",M1
15681079,"Epinephrine is an enhancer of rat intestinal absorption.Some physiological substances, including acetylcholine and nitric oxide, are useful candidates for stimulation of intestinal absorption of drugs. In the present study, we elucidated the ability of epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) to stimulate the intestinal absorption of drugs. We evaluated the ability of Epi to enhance absorption of macromolecules using dextran (Mw 4000 Da), which is poorly absorbed from the intestine, as a model compound in situ in a closed loop of the rat jejunum. Treatment of the jejunum with Epi resulted in significant increase in absorption of dextran in a dose-dependent fashion. The area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 4 h in the Epi-treated jejunum was 13-fold higher than that in the vehicle-treated jejunum. The absorption-enhancing activity of Epi was 40-fold higher than that of caprate, a clinically used absorption-enhancer of drugs. In the experimental conditions used in this study, histological injury of the mucosa and perturbation of the mucosal membrane were not observed in the Epi-treated jejunum. Treatment with an antagonist of alpha-adrenergic receptors attenuated the stimulation of intestinal absorption by Epi, and treatment with an agonist of alpha-adrenergic receptors resulted in enhancement of intestinal absorption. While an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors enhanced the absorption-enhancing effect of Epi, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors stimulated intestinal absorption. These results indicate that stimulation of adrenergic receptors may be a novel strategy for intestinal absorption of drugs.",M1
15677399,"Stressor specificity and effect of prior experience on catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.The specific activation of two components of the sympathoadrenal system (adrenomedullary and sympathoneural) by various stressors was recently described. The aim of this work was to investigate changes in catecholamine (CA) biosynthetic enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene expression, protein level, and activity in the adrenal medulla of rats after a single or repeated exposure to various homotypic or novel heterotypic stressors. Immobilization for 2 h (IMO), cold 4 degrees C (COLD), administration of insulin 5I U (INS), or 2-deoxyglucose 500 mg/kg (2DG) were used as stressors. Plasma epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and norepinephrine (NE) levels clearly showed that these stressors specifically activate the aforementioned systems. A single exposure to IMO, COLD, INS, or 2DG induced increases in PNMT mRNA levels in the adrenal medulla. Besides PNMT mRNA, repeated exposure to IMO also elevated activity and protein levels of the enzyme; however, chronic cold exposure did not show PNMT changes compared to control animals at room temperature. PNMT gene expression was also investigated in rats adapted to repeated immobilization stress or to chronic cold exposure after a single exposure to various heterotypic novel stressors. Cold-adapted rats responded to heterotypic novel stressors (IMO, INS) by exaggerated responses of PNMT mRNA levels compared to responses in naive rats exposed to the same stressors at room temperature. Immobilization-adapted rats did not show exaggerated responses of PNMT mRNA after exposure to novel stressors. Therefore, observed differences in plasma CA and adrenomedullary mRNA levels suggest a specific regulation of CA release, synthesis, and gene expression of CA biosynthetic enzymes, which depends on the quality of the stressor. Exposure of adapted rats to novel stressors induces exaggerated responses, but this process also depends on the specificity of the stressor used. Different stressors regulate PNMT gene expression by specific mechanisms especially in chronically stressed rats. These mechanisms remain to be elucidated. It is the ability of the long-term stressed organism to respond differently to novel heterotypic stressors that we consider an important adaptive phenomenon of catecholaminergic systems in rats.",M1
15638106,"In vitro effect of silicone oil and liquid perfluorocarbons on platelet aggregation.PURPOSE: To study the in vitro effect of silicone oil of different viscosities and liquid perfluorocarbons on platelet aggregation. METHODS: Silicone oil with a viscosity of 5700 cs and 1000 cs and liquid perfluorocarbons of perfluoroperhydrophenantren and perfluorodecaline were studied to investigate the effect of these agents on platelet aggregation under in vitro conditions. The experiments were performed by using platelet rich plasma with an aggregometer. Aggregation was induced with three different agonists, including 5 -adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), and collagen (Col). The results were obtained as a percentage of maximal aggregation and compared with controls using Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance test. RESULTS: The tests with ADP as aggregating agent revealed that the percentage of maximal aggregation was a mean of 72.66+/-3.51% for ADP only, 58.66+/-3.05% for silicone oil of 1000 cs, 62.66+/-2.08% for silicone oil of 5700 cs, 56.00+/-7.00% for perfluoroperhydrophenantren, and 52.3+/-3.1 % for perfluorodecaline. With EPI, aggregation was induced in all control samples with a mean of 76+/-9.54%. The mean percentage of maximal aggregation was 66.7+/-3.06 for silicone oil of 1000 cs, 72.33+/-5.5% for silicone oil of 5700 cs, 71.67+/-3.79% for perfluoroperhydrophenantren, and 70.33+/-2.52% for perfluorodecaline. With collagen, it was 86.67+/-1.53% for controls, 83.67+/-3.51% for silicone oil of 1000 cs, 85.33+/-4.51% for silicone oil of 5700 cs, 83.33+/-4.93% for perfluoroperhydrophenantren, and 81.33+/-4.16% for perfluorodecaline. Statistical analysis revealed no significant change in the percentage of maximal aggregation for all tested substances in the experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Silicone oil of different viscosities and perfluoroperhydrophenantren and perfluorodecaline have minimal antiaggregating effect on platelets. The level of effect is not statistically significant.",M1
15614787,"Modulation of hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine by estrogen in the female rat.Clinical studies have demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy suppresses stress-induced increases in plasma catecholamines. The present study determined whether normal circulating levels of estrogen can modulate hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>). In anesthetized female rats, insulin-induced hypoglycemia (0.25 U/kg) increased plasma EPI concentration to a significantly greater extent in 14-day ovariectomized (OVEX) rats compared to that in sham-operated controls. In 17beta-estradiol (E2)-replaced OVEX rats, the hypoglycemia-induced rise in plasma EPI was reduced significantly when compared to that in vehicle-replaced OVEX rats. OVEX and E2 replacement had no effect on tyrosine hydroxylase or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA levels in the adrenal medulla. In isolated adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ were unaffected by 48-hr exposure to 10 nM E2. In contrast, acute (3-min) exposure to micromolar concentrations of E2 dose-dependently and reversibly inhibited agonist-induced Ca2+ transients. In addition, in OVEX rats, a constant infusion of E2 significantly reduced the insulin-induced increase in plasma EPI concentration compared to that in vehicle-infused controls. These data demonstrate that physiologic levels of circulating E2 can modulate hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma EPI. This effect seems independent of steroid influence on adrenal medullary secretion or biosynthesis. In contrast, acute exposure to high levels of E2 can also suppress hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine, due at least in part to inhibition of stimulus-secretion coupling.",M1
15585598,"Differing physiological effects of epinephrine in type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic humans.Acute increases of the key counterregulatory hormone epinephrine can be modified by a number of physiological and pathological conditions in type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). However, it is undecided whether the physiological effects of epinephrine are also reduced in T1DM. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether target organ (liver, muscle, adipose tissue, pancreas, cardiovascular) responses to epinephrine differ between healthy subjects and T1DM patients. Thirty-four age- and weight-matched T1DM (n = 17) and healthy subjects (n = 17) underwent two randomized, single-blind, 2-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies with (<e>Epi</e>) and without epinephrine infusion. Muscle biopsy was performed at the end of each study. Epinephrine levels during Epi were similar in all groups (4,039 +/- 384 pmol/l). Glucose (5.3 +/- 0.06 mmol/l) and insulin levels (462 +/- 18 pmol/l) were also similar in all groups during the glucose clamps. Glucagon responses to Epi were absent in T1DM and significantly reduced compared with healthy subjects. Endogenous glucose production during the final 30 min was significantly greater during Epi in healthy subjects compared with T1DM (8.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.6 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1), P = 0.041). Glucose uptake showed almost a twofold greater decrease with Epi in healthy subjects vs. T1DM (Delta31 +/- 2 vs. Delta17 +/- 2 nmol.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively, P = 0.026). Glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) all increased significantly more in T1DM compared with healthy subjects. Increases in systolic blood pressure were greater in healthy subjects, but reductions of diastolic blood pressure were greater in T1DM patients with Epi. Reduction of glycogen synthase was significantly greater during epinephrine infusion in T1DM vs. healthy subjects. In summary, despite equivalent epinephrine, insulin, and glucose levels, changes in glucose flux, glucagon, and cardiovascular responses were greater in healthy subjects compared with T1DM. However, T1DM patients had greater lipolytic responses (glycerol and NEFA) during Epi. Thus we conclude that there is a spectrum of significant in vivo physiological differences of epinephrine action at the liver, muscle, adipose tissue, pancreas, and cardiovascular system between T1DM and healthy subjects.",M1
15547139,"Mapping of genetic determinants of the sympathoneural response to stress.Activation of the sympathoadrenal system (SAS, comprising the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla) in response to stressful stimuli is an important defense mechanism as well as a contributor to several cardiovascular diseases. There is variability in the SAS response to stress, although the extent to which this is genetically regulated is unclear. Some rodent models, including the hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (hHTg) rat, are hyperresponsive to stress. We investigated whether quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect sympathoadrenal response to stress could be identified. Second filial generation rats (n = 189) derived from a cross of the hHTg rat and the Brown Norway rat had plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) levels, indices of activation of the sympathoneural and adrenal medulla components, respectively, measured in the resting state and in response to an immobilization stress. Responses were assessed early (20 min) and late (120 min) after the application of the stress. A genome scan was conducted using 153 microsatellite markers. Two QTLs (maximum peak LOD scores of 4.17 and 3.52, respectively) influencing both the early and late plasma NE response to stress were found on chromosome 10. Together, the QTLs accounted for approximately 20% of the total variation in both the early and late NE responses in the F(2) rats. Interestingly, the QTLs had no effect on plasma Epi response to stress. These findings provide evidence for a genetic determination of the response of a specific component of the SAS response to stress. Genetically determined variation in sympathetic nervous system response to stress may contribute to cardiovascular diseases.",M1
15544604,"Constant infusion of epinephrine, but not bolus treatment, improves haemodynamic recovery in anaphylactic shock in dogs.OBJECTIVE: Epinephrine (<e>Epi</e>) is the treatment of choice for reversing cardiovascular collapse in anaphylactic shock (AS). In this condition, most treatment guidelines have been anecdotally derived and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted. In the present study, we examined the time course of haemodynamic recovery in a canine model of AS when Epi was administered at the initiation of allergen challenge before fully developed shock had occurred. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, crossover studies were performed approximately 3-5 weeks apart in ragweed-sensitized dogs while the animals were ventilated and anaesthetized. Epi was administered by bolus intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.) routes and by continuous i.v. infusion (CI). The findings obtained in the Epi treatment (T) studies were compared with those found in a no treatment (NT) study. In the bolus studies, Epi was administered at 0.01 mg/kg, while in the CI study, the dose of Epi was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 70% of preshock levels. MAP, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and pulmonary wedge pressure (Pwp) were determined over a 3 h period. RESULTS: In the CI study, haemodynamics (CO, MAP, and SV) were significantly higher than those measured in the NT study and the bolus studies over approximately the first hour of the study. In the CI study, the amount of Epi infused was significantly less than in the bolus studies. CONCLUSION: When administered at the initiation of allergen challenge, bolus treatment of Epi by i.m., i.v., or s.c. routes caused limited haemodynamic improvement in AS. In contrast, constant infusion of Epi at a lower total dose produced significant haemodynamic improvement. Within the limits of this anaesthetized canine model, the results suggest that CI should be the preferred route in the treatment of AS when this treatment option is available.",M1
15536607,"Ionomycin, but not physiologic doses of epinephrine, stimulates skeletal muscle interleukin-6 mRNA expression and protein release.It has been hypothesized that epinephrine may stimulate interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression in skeletal muscle. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of epinephrine on IL-6 gene expression within, and protein release from, skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that physiologic epinephrine would neither result in an increase in IL-6 mRNA nor protein release from skeletal muscle. Soleus muscle was excised from 4-week-old anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats and incubated in a Krebs buffer with the addition of either saline (CON), epinephrine, at concentrations of 1,000 nmol/L (<e>EPI</e> 1,000), 100 nmol/L (EPI 100), or 10 nmol/L (EPI 10), or the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (IONO), a positive control. After a 1-hour incubation, muscle was collected and extracted for RNA, reverse transcribed, and IL-6 gene expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An aliquot of incubation medium was also collected and analyzed for IL-6 protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA). EPI 1,000 and IONO increased (P &lt; .05) IL-6 mRNA, whereas EPI 100 and EPI 10 were without effect. IL-6 protein release from skeletal muscle was increased in IONO (P &lt; .05), but not in CON or EPI at any concentration. These data demonstrate that while pharmacologic concentrations of epinephrine activate IL-6 mRNA, supraphysiologic and high-physiologic doses appear to have little, if any, effect on IL-6 gene transcription in skeletal muscle. In addition, ionomycin can stimulate IL-6 gene expression and protein release after only 1 hour of exposure.",M1
15518669,"Depression and anxiety symptoms are related to increased 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion among healthy middle-aged women.OBJECTIVE: Depression is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in a variety of populations, and anxiety has also been associated with risk of mortality among cardiac patients. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system may be involved in this risk. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between levels of self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety and 24-hour urinary catecholamine excretion. METHOD: Ninety-one women aged 47-55 years were evaluated. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and state anxiety was assessed with the state anxiety portion (SAI) of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Twenty-four hour urine collections were assayed for epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>), norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol (CORT). EPI, NE and CORT were indexed by body surface area to control for individual differences in body size. RESULTS: Higher levels of depression symptoms were associated with increased 24-hour NE excretion (r=.27, P=.009), with depressed women (n=17, BDI scores &gt;/=10) exhibiting an approximately 25% higher rate of urinary NE excretion than women with BDI scores &lt;10 (n=74), P=.007. Higher levels of state anxiety were also related to greater NE excretion (r=.28, P=.01), and CORT excretion was related to both depression (r=.23, P=.02) and anxiety (r=.22, P=.04). Depression and anxiety symptoms were unrelated to urinary EPI excretion. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings that higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms are related to increased 24-hour urinary NE and CORT excretion among women suggests that depression and anxiety may be associated with increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and are consistent with the possibility that SNS activity may play a role in the increased mortality associated with depression in community-dwelling older adults.",M1
15491380,"Additive effects of dexamethasone in nebulized salbutamol or L-epinephrine treated infants with acute bronchiolitis.BACKGROUND: Although it is the most common lower respiratory infection of infancy, the optimal treatment for acute bronchiolitis is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the early and late effects of nebulized L-epinephrine (<e>EPI</e>) and intramuscular dexamethasone (DEX) combination therapy with nebulized salbutamol (SAL) and dexamethasone combination and bronchodilators alone in outpatients with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: A total of 69 infants aged 2-21 months who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, with acute bronchiolitis were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective trial study. Patients were assigned to receive either nebulized L-epinephrine (3 mg) or salbutamol (0.15 mg/kg) and 15 min later, either dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg or placebo (PLA), intramuscularly, in a double-blind randomized fashion. The study groups were: epinephrine + dexamethasone group (group 1, n=23), salbutamol + dexamethasone group (group 2, n=23), epinephrine + placebo group (group 3, n=11), and salbutamol + placebo group (group 4, n=12). The outcome measures were heart rate, respiratory rate and Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score determined at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, 24 h, and 5 days after the first therapy. Patients were then followed-up during the subsequent 2 months for the prevalance of respiratory complaints regarding bronchial hyperreactivity. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the outcome variables of the four groups within the first 120 min and at 24 hours, or between the rates of requirement of a second dose of the same bronchodilator. However, fifth day RDAI score values of both DEX groups were significantly lower than that of SAL + PLA group (P=0.000 and P=0.01, respectively). The fifth day score value of group 1 was also significantly better than that value of EPI + PLA group but not different from group 2. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone added to nebulized L-epinephrine, or salbutamol therapies resulted in better outcome measures than bronchodilators alone in the late phase (fifth day) of mild to moderate degree bronchiolitis attack. However, effects of EPI + DEX combination was not different from SAL + DEX combination.",M1
19806787,"Weekly administration of docetaxel and epirubicin as first-line treatment for hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma.Androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (AICP) is one of the tumors that continue to respond poorly to chemotherapy. Recently, protocols based on the use of docetaxel have significantly improved survival for patients in this disease. In other types of neoplastic disease, combined therapy with taxanes and anthracycline derivatives has been shown to produce additive effects in terms of growth inhibition, and superior tolerability when associated with weekly administration schedules. These findings prompted us to examine the tolerability and efficacy of weekly treatment of AICP with docetaxel (DOX) plus epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>). We enrolled 35 chemotherapy-naive men with AICP (mean age 72 years, range 68-77) and normal hepatic, renal, and cardiac function. The chemotherapy protocol provided for the IV administration of DOX (30 mg/m2) and EPI (30 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Treatment was continued for 6 months or until disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored in all patients, and reductions from baseline values of &gt;50% were considered indicative of positive responses to treatment. Thirty-four patients were included in the analysis of toxicity, and objective responses to treatment were assessed in the 28 patients with measurable lesions. Nineteen patients (56%) experienced PSA reductions of &gt;50% that persisted for more than 4 weeks. The response to therapy was classified as complete in 1 of the 28 patients (4%) with measurable disease (at the lymph node level). Thirteen others (13/28, 46%) had partial responses, in nine (32%) the disease remained unchanged, and progression was observed in the remaining five (18%); overall response rate was 50% (CR + PR). Of the 27 patients with pain at the time of enrollment, 16 (59%) experienced pain reduction during treatment. The median time to disease progression was 11.7 months (95% CI: 7.7-15.7) while the median survival time was 18.7 months (95% CI: 12.3-25.1). During the study, four patients developed grade 3 anemia and leukopenia, which was reversible in all cases. Lower grades of asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral edema were also observed. There were no cases of cardiotoxic effects. Alopecia was frequent but reversible in all cases. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the combined administration of DOX and EPI for treatment of AIPC is effective and well tolerated. The weekly administration of the drug combination appears to be a promising approach to the treatment of these tumors.",M2

19760422,"The role of mean diffusivity (MD) as a predictive index of the response to chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: a preliminary study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of mean diffusivity (MD) as a predictive index of the response to chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Twenty-one women referred to our institution with a diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies at 1.5 T before beginning and after completing combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The examination protocol included an <e>EPI</e> sequence sensitised to diffusion (b-value 1,000 s/mm(2)) and three-dimensional (3D) coronal T1 sequences before and after intravenous contrast medium. Tumours were delineated by using dynamic MR acquisition before and after chemotherapy. The percentage of tumour volume reduction (PVR) and pre-(MD(pre)) and post-therapy (MD(post)) MD values were computed for each lesion. RESULTS: PVR &gt;or= 65% was observed in 17/21 patients (responders). MD(pre) of responders (0.99 +/- 0.27 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly (p = 0.025) lower than MD(pre) of non-responders (1.46 +/- 0.33 10(-3) mm(2)/s). Moreover, in patients as a whole PVR significantly correlated (p = 0.01, r = -0.54) with MD(pre). MD(post) (1.26 +/- 0.39 10(-3) mm(2)/s) of responders was significantly(p = 0.024) higher than MD(pre) (0.99 +/- 0.27 mm(2) 10(-3) mm(2)/s), whereas non-responders MD(post) (1.00 +/- 0.14 10(-3) mm(2)/s)did not increase compared with MD(pre) (1.46 +/- 0.33 10(-3) mm(2)/s). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study seems to indicate that low values of pre-chemotherapy MD may identify, before starting treatment, the patients with higher probability of response in terms of percentage of volume reduction of the lesion. MD may represent a complementary parameter useful to correctly select patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",M2

To minimize toxicity and increase CNS penetration, EPI was incorporated into biodegradable polymers, and its in vitro and in vivo properties were studied. 9L, F98, C6, U251, and EMT-6 cell lines were treated with EPI in vitro and cell viability was measured. Toxicity of EPI/polycarboxyphenoxypropane-sebacic-acid (pCPP:SA) polymers was tested in vivo using F344 rats intracranially implanted with EPI polymers (2-50% by weight). The efficacy of 50% EPI:pCPP:SA polymers was determined in F344 rats intracranially challenged with 9L and treated either simultaneously or 5 days after tumor implantation. The efficacy of 50% EPI:pCCP:SA polymers administered on Day 5 in combination with oral TMZ was determined in rats intracranially challenged with 9L gliosarcoma. EPI was cytotoxic in all cell lines used in vitro. Intracranial implantation of the EPI polymers in rats generated neither local nor systemic toxicity. Animals receiving intracranial EPI on Day 5 had 50% long-term survivors (LTS), which was superior to local EPI delivered on Day 0 (LTS = 12.5%). Animals receiving intracranial EPI in combination with oral TMZ had 75% LTS whereas no other group had LTS. In those EPI treated animals that died before the controls there was evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Systemic epirubicin resulted in high toxicity levels and early deaths in all the experiments. EPI polymers, alone or in combination with oral TMZ, is an effective therapeutic modality against experimental 9L gliosarcoma.",M2
19682512,"Clinical experience with anthracycline antibiotics-HPMA copolymer-human immunoglobulin conjugates.This paper reviews an early clinical experience with anthracycline (epirubicin; <e>Epi</e> or doxorubicin; Dox) containing an N-(2-hydroyxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer carrier targeted with autologous or commercial human immunoglobulin in six patients aged 28-55 suffering from therapy-resistant metastatic cancer. More than 100 biochemical, hematological and immunological parameters, including nine tumor markers, were tested in blood samples taken 24 h after the first and up to 10 months after the last application. The intravenous application proceeded without serious adverse or side effects and did not require hospitalization. Cardiotoxicity was not observed. Four of six monitored patients attained stabilization of disease (liver ultrasound scan and bone computer tomography) with a very good quality of life lasting from seven up to 18 months. Positive response to the treatment was, among others, evaluated as decreased CA 15-3 and CEA tumor markers. In three of five tested patients the serum level of C-reactive protein was temporarily increased 72 h after the treatment. A stable or elevated number of peripheral blood reticulocytes together with activation of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells supports the data previously obtained in experimental animals pointing to a dual role, i.e. the cytotoxic and immunomobilizing character of doxorubicin-HPMA conjugates.",M2
19593083,"Phase I study of fixed dose gemcitabine plus epirubicin in patients with advanced solid malignancies.OBJECTIVES: A Phase I study was initiated to investigate fixed dose rate gemcitabine (GEM) combined with epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) given weekly or every other week, since, GEM given as a standard 30 minute infusion has modest activity. The study was designed based on the hypothesis that prolonged exposure (over 90 minutes) may improve response rates and combination with epirubicin (EPI) is synergistic. METHODS: Eligible patients had measurable refractory solid malignancies with adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver functions. Patients received GEM 800, 1000, 1250 mg/m(2) over 90 minutes followed by EPI 10 or 15 mg/m(2) as a 30 minutes infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 or days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and 24 are evaluable for overall toxicities and response rate. Toxicities include neutropenia (Gr 3 of Gr 4, 9 pts), thrombocytopenia (Gr 3 of Gr 4, 3 pts), fatigue (Gr 3 of Gr 4, 4 pts), and myalgia (Gr 3 of Gr 4, 1 pt). Dose limiting toxicity was grade 4 neutropenia. Seven patients experienced stable disease for &gt;16 weeks and 3 patients with pancreatic cancer had partial responses. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose is GEM 800 mg/m(2)/EPI 10 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, 15 or GEM 1000 mg/m(2)/EPI 15 mg/m(2) days 1, 15 given every 4 weeks.

19542717,"Prevention of venous pain and phlebitis caused by epirubicin hydrochloride.Many patients complain of venous pain or develop phlebitis following treatment with epirubicin hydrochloride(<e>EPI</e>). To ensure effective and safe treatment with this drug, it is essential to deal with the adverse events associated with it appropriately. At our hospital, EPI was previously administered by drip infusion(diluted with 50mL of physiological saline)over 15 minutes after pretreatment(EPI main route). With this method of treatment, venous pain and phlebitis developed in 14 of 15 cases. In 3 of these 14 cases, the regimen was modified. Following this experience, EPI administration was switched to drip infusion from the fully-opened side tube used for pretreatment(EPI sub-route). Switching to this route resulted in a sharp decrease in the incidence of venous pain and phlebitis, to only 1 of 15 cases. Stimulation of vascular tunica intima by EPI has been considered a factor principally responsible for the venous pain and phlebitis seen after EPI therapy. To prevent these adverse reactions, it is necessary to modify the method of administration so that strong or long-term exposure of blood vessels to EPI can be reduced. The results of this study suggest that the EPI sub-route we devised is useful in achieving this goal.",M2

Gene expression in biopsies obtained before and after one course of chemotherapy was analyzed. Expression of specific genes was significantly changed after one course of chemotherapy, particularly for Tax-Epi treatment. Comparison with histological response for both treatments revealed that only good responders exhibited changes in gene-expression profile.

A 2(3) factorial design was adopted with the type of surfactant, surfactant concentration and the pH of the polymerization medium as independent variables. The particle size, entrapment efficacy and polydispersity index of eight formulations were then evaluated. Two optimal EPI-NP formulations, 2% Tween 80 EPI-NP (TW80 EPI-NP) and 0.5% pluronic F68 EPI-NP (F68 EPI-NP) at pH 2.5 were developed. The sizes of TW80 EPI-NP and F68 EPI-NP at maximum intensity were 90 and 220 nm, respectively. Both TW80 EPI-NP and F68 EPI-NP showed potent cytotoxicity against human bladder cancer T24 and RT4 cells, compared with aqueous solutions of epirubicin (EPI-AQ). The penetration and accumulation of EPI-NPs in pig urothelium were studied by tissue concentration-depth profiles and fluorescence microscopy. The cumulative amounts of epirubicin following EPI-AQ, TW80 EPI-NP and F68 EPI-NP treatments were 842.48+/-24.66, 1314.66+/-33.07 and 595.21+/-24.16 microg, respectively.

Fas and FasL expression in rat testis were examined by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. Expression levels of Fas and FasL were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Serum sFas/sFasL levels were determined by ELISA. The results show that the testicular toxicity of Epi involved germ cell apoptosis. Fas and FasL protein expression levels were markedly increased in Epi-treated rat testes, as was expression of sFasL. In particular, increasing serum sFasL levels were positively correlated with elevated expression levels of FasL and sFasL in the testes of Epi-treated rats, revealing serum sFasL to be a promising marker of testicular toxicity after cytotoxic chemotherapy.",M2

One-electron reduction of the quinone moiety is followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have been proposed to induce cardiotoxicity through an oxidative stress; conversely, one-electron oxidation of the hydroquinone moiety by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and oxyferrous myoglobin (Mb(II)O(2)) is followed by an anthracycline degradation process that has been proposed to limit cardiotoxicity. We previously reported that tert-butoxycarbonyl-alanine (t-BA) impeded DOX oxidation/degradation by H(2)O(2)/Mb(II)O(2) in a cell-free system; accordingly, t-BA increased the levels of DOX, its conversion to ROS, and its concentration-related toxicity in cardiomyocytes. To re-explore methodological and toxicological aspects of anthracycline degradation, we used 4'-epidoxorubicin (<e>EPI</e>), an anthracycline analogue that is very similar to DOX but undergoes protonation-sequestration in cytoplasmic acidic organelles. t-BA lacked an effect on H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to EPI; however, blocking the protonation-sequestration mechanism with the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BFL), enabled t-BA to increase the cellular levels of EPI, its conversion to ROS, and its concentration-related toxicity. This suggested that t-BA was specific enough to increase the cellular levels and toxicity of only those anthracyclines that were liable to oxidation/degradation by H(2)O(2)/Mb(II)O(2). By exposing cardiomyocytes to nontoxic concentrations of DOX or EPI and by increasing their cellular levels by means of appropriate combinations with t-BA, BFL, or t-BA+BFL, we nonetheless found that the loss of cardiomyocyte viability correlated with the accumulation of undegraded anthrayclines but not with their ability to form ROS or to induce lipid peroxidation. This suggested that an accumulation of undegraded anthracyclines might induce cardiotoxicity also by mechanisms independent of ROS and oxidative stress. Thus, EPI proved useful to refine the value of t-BA in the studies of anthracycline degradation and to reappraise the role of anthracycline degradation in cardiotoxicity.",M2
19186037,"Pullulan acetate nanoparticles prepared by solvent diffusion method for epirubicin chemotherapy.Pullulan acetate (PA) was synthesized by the reaction of pullulan with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine. PA was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR). A solvent diffusion method was employed in the current work to prepare PA nanoparticles. This technique had some advantages compared with other methods. The particle size increased from 185.7 nm to 423.0 nm with the degree of acetylation increasing from 2.71 to 3.0. Drug-loaded PA nanoparticles were prepared for controlled release of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>). The drug entrapment and drug content increased with the degree substitution of PA increasing. EPI was released from the nanoparticles in a biphasic profile with a fast release rate in the first 10h followed by a slow release in vitro. A higher cytotoxicity against KB cells was found for EPI-loaded PA nanoparticles in comparison with free EPI. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observations indicate that EPI-loaded nanoparticles were internalized and released in the cytoplasmic compartment.",M2
19148555,"Predictive value of survivin alternative transcript expression in locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Survivin, a member of the apoptosis inhibitor protein family, is expressed in numerous human tumours, and its expression is described as a negative prognostic marker. Four alternative splice variants (survivin-DeltaEx3, survivin-3B, survivin-2B and survivin-2alpha) have been described. To date, little is known about the prognostic or predictive role of all five survivin transcripts in breast cancer. In this study, we analysed, by means of real-time quantitative PCR, the five survivin transcripts in a population of 60 breast carcinoma patients treated with 5-fluorouracil + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (FEC, n=32) or with docetaxel + epirubicin (Tax-<e>Epi</e>, n=28). For each patient, samples were obtained before and after one course of chemotherapy. Before treatment, the ratio of survivin-2alpha was significantly higher in resistant than in sensitive tumours treated by the FEC regimen (p=0.0161), while the ratio of survivin-DeltaEx3 was higher in sensitive than in resistant samples treated with Tax-Epi (p=0.0234). After one course of chemotherapy, expression of survivin-3B was significantly associated with resistance (p=0.0448) in the FEC treatment group, and the ratios of survivin-DeltaEx3 (p=0.0071) and survivin-2B (p=0.0380) were significantly higher in sensitive than in resistant tumours in the Tax-Epi treatment group. Notably, increased expression and ratio of survivin-3B after one course of Tax-Epi was associated with reduced disease-free survival (p=0.0299 and 0.0277, respectively) and with reduced overall survival (p=0.0145 and &lt;0.0001, respectively) of the patients. These results indicate that an imbalance in the alternative transcript ratios may make the cells resistant or sensitive to apoptosis. They also demonstrate for the first time that alternative survivin transcript expression levels may be predictive markers in FEC and Tax-Epi treatment in breast carcinoma.",M2
19068724,"[Intravesical instillation with epirubicin as a prophylactic treatment for superficial bladder cancer--using two different schedules]Intravesical chemotherapy is performed after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for superficial bladder cancer. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study on the prophylactic effects of intravesical instillation of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) against recurrence to determine the effective administration schedule. Between April 1999 and March 2003, 54 patients with superficial bladder tumor (pTa or pT1, and G1 or G2 cancer) were assigned to two groups (25 in Group A, 29 in Group B) after TURBT. The schedule of instillation (intravesically 40 mg of EPI dissolved in 40 ml saline) was subsequently once every two weeks for 3 months (7 times) starting one week after TURBT (Group A, short period), and subsequently added every two weeks for 3 months starting 6 months after TURBT (Group B, long period). The patients were followed up by cystoscopy and urinary cytology. There was no significant difference in non-recurrence rates after either one year (A; 62.5%, B; 82.8%) or three years (A; 53.6%, B; 67.3%). A univariate analysis demonstrated that tumor grade and staging were significant predictors of high risk for recurrence. A multivariate analysis performed by using the Cox's proportional hazard model showed that the schedule of instillation was an independent prognostic factor for reccurence. In the present study, only 2 patients showed progression and one patient died of UC. There was no adverse event that forced discontinuation of the therapy. In conclusion, epirubicin instillation influenced the prevention of recurrence, but the benefit of long-term period was not confirmed.",M2
18768436,"Type 1 receptor tyrosine kinase profiles identify patients with enhanced benefit from anthracyclines in the BR9601 adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy trial.PURPOSE: Patients with early breast cancer who receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy experience improved relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those who receive non-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Such benefit, however, may be restricted to women whose tumors have specific molecular characteristics. We tested the hypothesis that HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)/HER1, HER3, Ki67, and topoisomerase IIalpha expression are predictive of outcome after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Tissue microarrays from 322 of 374 women in the BR9601 trial, which compared cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with epirubicin followed by CMF (<e>epi</e>-CMF), were analyzed for HER1, 2, 3, 4; Ki67; and topoisomerase IIalpha protein expression and for HER2/topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification. Their relationships to RFS and OS were investigated, and multiple regression analysis was used to identify interactions. RESULTS: A significant interaction was seen between tumors with normal HER1, HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or HER3 levels and the enhanced benefit from epi-CMF versus CMF for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3, 0.92; P = .035) and for OS (HR, 0.30; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3), 0.98; P = .023). Neither Ki67 nor TIIalpha expressions or gene alterations showed clear predictive value for benefit from the addition of the anthracycline. CONCLUSION: Patients with HER2 amplified and those with HER1, HER2 FISH, or HER3-positive tumors did not benefit from the addition of epirubicin to CMF. Conversely, patients with HER2 nonamplified and HER1 through HER3-negative tumors showed significantly increased RFS and OS rates when treated with epi-CMF compared with CMF.",M2
18758179,"Dose escalation study of epirubicin and docetaxel in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines and taxanes are major cytotoxic drugs against breast cancer. To develop a combination of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and docetaxel (DTX) in Japan, dose escalation and pharmacokinetic studies were performed in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer. METHODS: Twenty patients received EPI (40, 50 or 60 mg/m(2)) as 5-min intravenous infusion, followed by DTX infusion (50 or 60 mg/m(2)) over 1 h in cohorts of 3-6 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined during the first cycle when more than 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients suffered a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The DLT was based on febrile neutropenia (FN), prolonged neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and grade 3-4 nonhematological toxicity during the first cycle. Plasma sampling was performed to assess the pharmacokinetic study of these drugs. RESULTS: The second level (EPI/DTX 50/50 mg/m(2)) was found to be a maximum tolerated dose because of a short duration of FN with no distress. Subsequently, the protocol was modified to permit a new DLT definition including FN lasting for more than 72 h. At the following levels of EPI/DTX 50/50, 50/60 or 60/60 mg/m(2), the dose escalation study revealed a high incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (100%) and FN (67%), which did not reach DLT. However, the safety committee decided not to go further because of too high an incidence of FN lasting 3 days, although a little less than 72 h. The pharmacokinetic study with a combination of EPI and DTX showed comparable blood levels of DTX and EPI in relation to those seen when given alone. CONCLUSION: For further evaluation, the recommended dose and schedule of this combination is EPI 60 mg/m(2) and DTX 60 mg/m(2), given every 3 weeks to patients without prior chemotherapy and EPI 50 mg/m(2) and DTX 50 mg/m(2) given to patients with prior chemotherapy, respectively. The pharmacokinetic study indicates no interaction between EPI and DTX.",M2

SM (solamargine), a major steroidal alkaloid glycoside purified from Solanum incanum, triggered apoptosis of breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells) and non-cancerous breast epithelial cells (HBL-100 cells) within 3 h. To extend the application of trastuzumab in breast cancer patients, the regulation of HER2/neu expression by SM was investigated. SM significantly up-regulates HER2/neu expression in breast cancer cells with low and high expression levels of HER2/neu, and synergistically enhanced the effect of trastuzumab in inhibiting cell proliferation. Additionally, HER2/neu and TOP2A [TopoII (topoisomerase II) alpha] genes share the same amplicon on an identical chromosome.

18657957,"Evaluation of epirubicin-induced acute oxidative stress toxicity in rat liver cells and mitochondria, and the prevention of toxicity through quercetin administration.Anticancer therapy with epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) results in acute hepatotoxicity, likely due to the generation of free radicals. However, the oxidative status of rat liver cells and mitochondria after EPI toxicity has not been investigated. In the present study, we first investigated the pro-oxidant effect of EPI on both hepatic cells and mitochondrial function. Injection of EPI into rats at a dose of 9mg/kg (cumulative dose in human chemotherapy), induced hepatic dysfunction, as revealed by a significant increase in serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases (SGOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminases (SGPT). Oxidative stress in liver cells and mitochondria was provoked by EPI because a statistically significant reduction of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytosolic glutathione (GSH) levels, and a significant increase in malonedialdehyde (MDA) levels - an indicator of lipid peroxidation that can perforate biological membranes - were observed. Second, the protective effect of quercetin (QE) (0.33mg/kg) against EPI-induced oxidative stress was also investigated. Indeed, the pretreatment of rats with QE protected liver cells and mitochondria from oxidative stress. This treatment prevented hepatic dysfunction by maintaining normal levels of serum transaminases following the inhibition of their hepatic leakage by preventing lipid peroxidation. Thus, QE works through the prevention of cellular membrane perforation and the antioxidant defense system of mitochondria from liver cells, which represent compartments for the permanent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the respiratory chain.",M2
18620815,"The role of doxorubicin and epirubicin in the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.Advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is characterized by prevalently osteoblastic bone metastases which are what mostly affect these patients' quality of life and make the assessment of response to treatment particularly difficult by commonly used criteria. HRPC cannot be cured by any available therapeutic option, and chemotherapy has to be still considered as a palliative treatment. The anthracyclines doxorubicin (Dox) and epirubicin (<e>Epi</e>), alone or in combination with other agents, have been extensively used in the treatment of HRPC, but controversial results have been reported. The majority of reviewed studies reported a pain reduction in &gt;50% of patients receiving Dox or Epi, suggesting a substantial palliative effect by their use in metastatic HRPC. The weekly schedule of anthracyclines seemed to achieve similar results to the 3-weekly schedule but with a better toxicity profile. Although the toxic adverse effects were usually manageable when anthracyclines were combined with other agents, toxicity was severe by a number of aggressive regimens. Docetaxel is today approved for the treatment of HRPC, and must be considered the standard platform on which new agents may be combined. Given that HRPC includes a heterogeneous group of patients with variable rates of tumour growth, the combination of docetaxel with active agents such as anthracyclines may deserve further clinical investigation.",M2

Fifty-four patients with advanced but surgically resectable HCC were studied. Thirty-four patients who elected to undergo preoperative superselective TACE were randomized to low- and high-dose TACE. Patients in group A (n = 16) received low-dose anticancer drugs: 2 mg mitomycin C (MMC), 10 mg epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), and 100 mg carboplatin (CBP). Patients in group B (n = 18) were given high doses of anticancer drugs (10 mg MMC, 40 mg EPI, and 300 mg CBP). Hepatic resection was subsequently performed. Group C comprised 20 patients who underwent resection without TACE. In all patients the necrosis rates and apoptosis index of tumor cells were evaluated by pathologic examinations and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay. There was no significant difference between group A and group B in tumor response (p [ 0.05) after TACE. Necrosis rates in groups A, B, and C were 88.4 +/- 11.1%, 87.1 +/- 12.5%, and 7.3 +/- 3.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference between group A and group B (p [ 0.05), while statistical difference was found between group A and group C (p \ 0.001) and between group B and group C (p \ 0.001). Apoptosis indexes in the three groups were 11.0 +/- 4.0%, 10.7 +/- 3.9%, and 5.6 +/- 2.6%, respectively. Statistical difference exhibited between group A and group C (p \ 0.001) and group B versus group C (p \ 0.001). No significant difference was observed between group A and group B (p [ 0.05). In conclusion, superselective TACE with low- and high-dose chemotherapeutic agents induced similar degrees of cellular apoptosis and necrosis.",M2

Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to 70 minutes of EPI (10.3 microM) infusion and to 5 minutes of isoproterenol (ISO, 0.1 microM) at the end of the protocol. Coronary flow (CF), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the coronary effluents were evaluated throughout the protocol. RONS were detected in the coronary effluents by electron spin resonance spectroscopy with a spin probe, 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-pyrrolidine (CP-H, 0.1 mM). EPI induced a reduction in CF and in LVDP (P &lt; 0.001). ISO infusion enhanced CF and RPP in the control group; in the EPI group, these increases were significantly impaired. Release of LDH was significantly increased during EPI infusion (P &lt; 0.001). RONS was 2.5 times greater in the EPI group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, a significant deterioration in cardiac function was observed after EPI perfusion and was associated with cellular injury and the generation of myocardial RONS. Further investigations are now needed to determine whether new cardioprotective agents targeting oxidative stress may reduce the incidence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.",M2

This study was to evaluate the effects of fractionated low dose DDP on renal functions of gastric cancer patients. METHODS: From Sep. 1998 to Jun. 2002, 31 gastric cancer patients were treated with LFEP regimen at School of Oncology of Peking University: intravenous administration of calcium folinate (CF, 150 mg/m(2)) at Day 1-3, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 500 mg/m(2)) at Day 1-5, epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>, 60 mg/m(2)) at Day 1, and DDP (20 mg/m(2)) at Day 1-3. Urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) and routine urine test were assessed before chemotherapy and every other day during the 14-day chemotherapy; serum creatinine (sCr) and urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed at the 7th day and 14th day during treatment. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients, 13 had normal renal functions before chemotherapy, while only 1 had normal renal functions after chemotherapy. Urine NAG and gamma-GT were changed significantly after chemotherapy: they were increased significantly on the 4th day and maintained higher than normal level for another 14 days thereafter. Meanwhile, no significant change in sCr and BUN were observed.

17922055,"Anthracycline antibiotics induce acute renal tubular toxicity in children with cancer.Experimental evidence suggests that anthracyclines, widely used in cancer chemotherapy, may impair kidney function. We assessed kidney function by serum creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity indices (NAGi) and microalbuminuria (MA) in 160 serum and urine samples obtained from 66 children with cancer. The effect of dexrazoxane was analyzed in 6 children on dexrazoxane supportive therapy in conjunction with daunorubicin (DNR) treatment, as compared with 6 children not receiving this agent. NAGi was significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated after treatment by DNR, doxorubicin, epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and idarubicin (IDA). MA proved to be a less sensitive indicator of kidney damage than NAGi. DNR resulted in a progressive deterioration of proximal tubular function as determined by linear regression analysis. The mean NAGi in the dexrazoxanetreated group was significantly (p&lt;0.005) lower than in children not receiving dexrazoxane prior to DNR treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that DNR, EPI and IDA induced an acute renal tubular damage similar to known tubulotoxic agents as cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. The damage was clinically mild and only a minor proportion of patients can be expected to develop long-lasting tubulopathy with negative impact on the quality of life.",M2

METHODOLOGY: One hundred and twelve patients with unresectable HCC were randomly divided into two groups to receive superselective TACE. Patients in group A (n=52) received low-dose anticancer drugs: mitomycin C (MMC) 2-8 mg, epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) 5-10 mg and carboplatin (CBP) 100mg were used. Patients in group B (n=60) were given conventional-dose of anticancer drugs (MMC 10 mg, EPI 40 mg, CBP 300 mg). Lipiodol-anticancer drugs emulsion was injected into the feeding arteries of tumors followed by gelatin sponge (GS) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles embolization. Liver function was evaluated with Child-Pugh scores, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) before TACE, three days, one week (wk) and four wk after procedures. RESULTS: In both groups, TBIL, ALT, and Child-Pugh scores increased (P &lt; 0.001 or P &lt; 0.05) and ALB decreased (P &lt; 0.001 or P &lt; 0.01) three days and one wk after TACE. The different between the parameters obtained four wk after the procedure and baseline parameters was not significant in group A (P &gt; 0.05). In group B, however, significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) was found in all parameters except ALT. CONCLUSIONS: Superselective TACE with use of low-dose anticancer drugs induces transient impairment in liver function, but use of conventional-dose anticancer drugs can cause lasting, more serious worsening of liver function.",M2

METHODS: EPI were measured by MTT assay , and the interaction between these two agents was evaluated by the isobologram technique of Berenbaum. Morphous of cell was observed by phase-contrast and electron microscope. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis. RESULTS: EPA significantly inhibited the growth of MGC-803 cells in a dose- and time-dependent way (P &lt; 0.01). Numerous abnormal particles were found around the nucleus of MGC-803 cells under phase-contrast microscope, and also many electron-dense material in cytoplasm were found under electron microscope. EPA significantly stimulated the growth of human embryonal pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) dose-dependently (P &lt; 0.01). A strong synergism was found between EPA and EPI in MGC-803 cells. EPA induced G0/G1-phase arrest but without statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05), and EPI significantly induced S-phase arrest (P &lt; 0.05) in MGC-803 cells.

17488527,"N-glycan alterations are associated with drug resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Correlations of disease phenotypes with glycosylation changes have been analysed intensively in the tumor biology field. Glycoforms potentially associated with carcinogenesis, tumor progression and cancer metastasis have been identified. In cancer therapy, drug resistance is a severe problem, reducing therapeutic effect of drugs and adding to patient suffering. Although multiple mechanisms likely underlie resistance of cancer cells to anticancer drugs, including overexpression of transporters, the relationship of glycans to drug resistance is not well understood. RESULTS: We established epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>)--and mitoxantrone (MIT)--resistant cell lines (HLE-EPI and HLE-MIT) from the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HLE). HLE-EPI and HLE-MIT overexpressed transporters MDR1/ABCB1 and BCRP/ABCG2, respectively. Here we compared the glycomics of HLE-EPI and HLE-MIT cells with the parental HLE line. Core fucosylated triantennary oligosaccharides were increased in the two resistant lines. We investigated mRNA levels of glycosyltransferases synthesizing this oligosaccharide, namely, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT)-IVa, GnT-IVb and alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (alpha1,6-FucT), and found that alpha1,6-FucT was particularly overexpressed in HLE-MIT cells. In HLE-EPI cells, GnT-IVa expression was decreased, while GnT-IVb was increased. Both GnT-IVs were downregulated in HLE-MIT cells. HLE-MIT cells also showed decreases in fucosylated tetraantennary oligosaccharide, the product of GnT-V. GnT-V expression was decreased in both lines, but particularly so in HLE-MIT cells. Thus both N-glycan and glycosyltransferase expression was altered as cells acquired tolerance, suggesting novel mechanisms of drug resistance. CONCLUSION: N-glycan and glycosyltransferase expression in HLE-EPI and HLE-MIT were analysed and presented that glycans altered according with acquired tolerance. These results suggested novel mechanisms of drug resistance.",M2

Recently, FEC regimen [5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), plus cyclophosphamide (CTX)] is the most commonly used; gemcitabine (GEM) is also a new active antimetabolite for breast cancer, however, the experience with neoadjuvant gemcitabine is limited. This study was to compare the efficacy of GC regimen and FEC regimen on breast cancer, and observe the adverse events. METHODS: From Mar. 2003 to Sep. 2005, 62 patients with stage II-III breast cancer were treated with 2 cycles of either GC regimen or FEC regimen before operation. The 22 patients in GC group received GEM (1000 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and DDP (75 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 2. The 40 patients in FEC group received EPI (50 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1, CTX (500 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and 5-FU (500 mg/m(2)) by 4-hour continuous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8. Clinical response and adverse events were assessed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate (RR) was 63.6% in GC group and 72.5% in FEC group. After GC therapy, 4 patients showed clinical complete remission (cCR), 2 pathologic complete remission (pCR), 10 partial remission (PR), 8 stable disease (SD)û while after FEC therapy, 9 patients showed cCR, 5 pCR, 20 PR, 10 SD. The most common adverse events were anemia, leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. More cases of leukopenia were observed in GC group (18/22, P&lt;0.05), and more cases of anemia in FEC group (29/40, P&lt;0.05); the occurrence rates of gastroenteric reaction were similar in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS: GC and FEC regimens are both effective for breast cancer with tolerable adverse events. The efficacy of FEC regimen is better than that of GT regimen.",M2
17385543,"Evaluation of the effect of paclitaxel, epirubicin and tamoxifen by cell kinetics parameters in estrogen-receptor-positive ehrlich ascites tumor (eat) cells growing in vitro.In this study the antiproliferative effects of Paclitaxel (PAC), Epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and Tamoxifen (TAM) on growth kinetics of Ehrlich Ascites Tumor (EAT) cells were examined in culture. An estrogen-receptor-positive ER (+) hyperdiploid EAT cell line growing in vitro was also analysed in the present study. IC50 doses of PAC, EPI and TAM (12 microg/ml, 12 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml, respectively) were used. Cells were treated with the above doses for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 hrs. At the end of these periods, living cell numbers were determined by collecting EAT cells in every group for growth study rate and for MTT assay. Therefore, the mitotic index was determined in the same experimental groups. The proliferation of EAT cells, inhibited by PAC, EPI and TAM concentrations was compared to control with increasing treatment time (4-32 hrs). Treatment of PAC, EPI and TAM alone for 24 hrs decreased the proliferation rate of EAT cells by 50% with respect to control. The inhibition of proliferation rate was higher in double drug treatment than that in single drug treatment with increased treatment time. In the treatment of three drugs applied for 32 hrs, this effect reached a maximum and proliferation rate decreased by 12% as compared to the (100%) control. In our studies, when the mitotic index parameter data were evaluated to determine which phase of the cell cycle was affected by PAC to cause the repression of cell reproduction, it was found that PAC exerted of its cytotoxic effect by causing cell accumulation at mitosis. The accumulation of the cells resulted in an increase in mitotic index values, which was an expected consequence of PAC treatment. It was observed that depending on the drug treatments, inhibition of proliferation rate and mitotic index in EAT cells were increased with respect to control, being with statistically significant occurrence (p &lt; 0.01 - p &lt; 0.001). As a result, concomitant treatment combined with hormonal therapy has given improved results compared with single treatment and PAC + EPI + TAM treatments had a maximum synergistic effect for 32 hrs (p &lt; 0.001).",M2
17366799,"[Treatment of advanced Wilms' tumor]OBJECTIVE: To improve prognosis of the patients with advanced Wilms' tumor, the authors compared different therapeutic strategies including preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), conventional preoperative chemotherapy and initial surgery. METHODS: Sixty-two patients aged from 5 months to 10 years (mean 3.2 years) were identified from medical records to have histologically confirmed advanced Wilms' tumor during the period from January 1993 to December 2002. The criteria for choice were huge tumor size with a volume more than 550 ml or the mass extending beyond the midline, involvement of vital structures, inferior vena cava invasion, distal metastasis or bilateral Wilms' tumor judged by imaging examination. All cases were divided into 3 groups according to the treatment received: 31 cases in group TACE received preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with Lipiodol-Epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>)-Vincristine emulsion. One week after TACE, systemic chemotherapy with Actinomycin D (ACTD) was administered and tumor resected at two weeks after TACE. 20 cases in group PC received conventional preoperative chemotherapy with VCR, ACTD plus EPI for 4-5 weeks, and 11 cases in group IS underwent initial surgery. Postoperative treatment for all patients was based on the postoperative staging and tumor histology. RESULTS: In the patients treated with TACE, no drug-induced complications such as cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatic dysfunction or bone marrow suppression were observed except for mild fever due to tumor necrosis. The percentages of tumor size shrinkage were 32.4% and 20.3% in group TACE and group PC, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Complete surgical removal of the tumor was achieved in 27 patients (87.1%) in group TACE, significantly higher in comparison with 14 in group PC (70.0%, P &lt; 0.05) and 2 in group IS (18.2%, P &lt; 0.01). Event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years was 87.1% (27/ 31), 60.0% (12/20) and 18.2% (2/11), respectivrely. EFS at 4 years was 84.6% (11/13), 56.3% (9/16 ) and 18.2% (2/11) in groups TACE, PC and IS, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that both preoperative TACE and conventional preoperative chemotherapy can be applied to the patients with advanced Wilms' tumor who are not candidates for immediately surgical resection. The survival is significantly increased in the patients undergoing preoperativeTACE when compared with conventional preoperative chemotherapy and initial surgery.",M2
17342096,"Anti-Cripto Mab inhibit tumour growth and overcome MDR in a human leukaemia MDR cell line by inhibition of Akt and activation of JNK/SAPK and bad death pathways.Doxorubicin (DOX) selection of CCRF-CEM leukaemia cell line resulted in multidrug resistance (MDR) CEM/A7R cell line, which overexpresses MDR, 1 coded P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Here, we report for the first time that oncoprotein Cripto, a founding member of epidermal growth factor-Cripto-FRL, 1-Criptic family is overexpressed in the CEM/A7R cells, and anti-Cripto monoclonal antibodies (Mab) inhibited CEM/A7R cell growth both in vitro and in an established xenograft tumour in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Cripto Mab synergistically enhanced sensitivity of the MDR cells to Pgp substrates epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), daunorubicin (DAU) and non-Pgp substrates nucleoside analogue cytosine arabinoside (AraC). In particular, the combination of anti-Cripto Mab at less than 50% of inhibition concentrations with noncytotoxic concentrations of EPI or DAU inhibited more than 90% of CEM/A7R cell growth. Cripto Mab slightly inhibited Pgp expression, and had little effect on Pgp function, indicating that a mechanism independent of Pgp was involved in overcoming MDR. We demonstrated that anti-Cripto Mab-induced CEM/A7R cell apoptosis, which was associated with an enhanced activity of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, resulting in an activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway as evidenced by dephosphorylation of Bad at Ser136, Bcl-2 at Ser70 and a cleaved caspase-9.",M2
17259127,"[Efficacy of activated charcoal-epirubicin suspension for treatment of breast cancer with axillary metastasis]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of activated charcoal-epirubicin suspension (<e>Epi</e>-CH) for treatment of breast cancer and clearance of axillary lymph node metastasis. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stages II-III were randomized into Epi-CH group (n=40) receiving injection with 10 mg Epi-CH in the tissue around the primary tumor 72 h before modified radical resection and control group (n=20) with 10 mg of aqueous epirubicin injection in the same region. The dissected axillary lymph nodes and the staining lymph nodes were counted. The concentration of epirubicin in the lymph nodes was detected by high-performance liquid chorography, and the specimens of lymph nodes were observed microscopically. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, Epi-CH injection allowed dissection of 4.04 more lymph nodes (P&lt;0.01) and resulted in the staining rate of the axillary lymph nodes of 86.9% (565/650). The proportion of the staining lymph nodes with diameter&gt;1.0 cm was significantly lower than that with diameter &lt;or=1.0 cm (96/131 vs 469/519, P&lt;0.01). The metastatic rate of stained lymph nodes was similar with that in non-stained lymph nodes (214/565 vs 23/85, P&gt;0.05). In Epi-CH group, the concentration of epirubicin in the stained lymph nodes was significantly higher than that in non-stained ones (443.0-/+123.1 vs 31.8-/+11.9 ng/g, P&lt;0.01). Remarkable degeneration and necrosis could be observed microscopically in the stained lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Epi-CH allows more effective treatment of breast cancer and clearance of axiliary metastasis by increasing the dissected lymph nodes and raising the concentration of epirubicin in the axillary lymph nodes.",M2
17212149,"[Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma providing a good QOL]We report a case of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 73-year-old man with positive HBV and HCV underwent a partial hepatectomy (S6 and S5) twice and transcatheter arterial (chemo) embolization (TAE) four times, thereafter. During these treatments, HCC became intractable and the patient complained of general fatigue. The liver function was Child's classification A, and serum AFP was 6,737 ng/ml. Abdominal CT scan revealed recurrent lesions in the right hepatic lobe and left adrenal gland. The catheter for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was inserted from the left femoral artery. Arterial chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU 750 mg) and cisplatin (CDDP 10 mg) was performed every two weeks. During 6 courses of this regimen, a significant side effect did not appear. Abdominal CT revealed no change in size, but serum AFP decreased up to 794 ng/ml and the general fatigue subsided. After 2 months, serum AFP began to increase and became 1454 ng/ml. The regimen of arterial chemotherapy was changed to epirubicin (<e>EPI</e> 40 mg every two weeks) and UFT-E (300 mg/day for four weeks), followed by a week off. An appetite loss (grade 2) appeared, but it could be well controlled. Serum AFP decreased again, up to 54 ng/ml. A good QOL was kept for about one year after the initiation of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.",M2

The patient, a 58-year-old Japanese woman, presented with an inoperable breast carcinoma (Stage IV). Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CPA) and epirubicin hydrochloride (<e>EPI</e>) resulted in a reduction in size of both the primary tumor and the metastatic lesions. However, the patient continued to experience purulent discharge accompanied by an unpleasant odor, as well as contact bleeding from the residual breast lesion. To address these complaints, we removed much of the remaining tumor surgically. The resulting skin defect measured 440 cm(2) and was covered using an external oblique myocutaneous flap. The patient's postoperative course was excellent, and she was still alive and well after 40 months of chemotherapy. This case is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the external oblique myocutaneous flap for the coverage of large ipsilateral chest wall defects.",M2
17135640,"Phase II study of cisplatin plus epirubicin salvage chemotherapy in refractory germ cell tumors.PURPOSE: Initial cisplatin (CIS) combination chemotherapy will cure 70% of patients with disseminated testicular cancer. This phase II clinical trial evaluated the combination of CIS plus epirubicin (CIS-<e>EPI</e>) in patients with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCT) not amenable to cure with standard salvage therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2001 and August 2005, 30 patients with GCT, who had received at least one previous CIS-based regimen, were enrolled. All patients were males, with median age 36 (range, 24 to 45 years). Twenty-one patients (70%) had experienced late relapses (&gt; 2 years). Patients received EPI 90 mg/m2 on day 1 and CIS 20 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks for maximum of four cycles. RESULTS: Nineteen (63%) of 30 patients received all four cycles. Toxicity was primarily hematologic: grade 3/4 neutropenia, four patients (one neutropenic fever); two patients had grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and five patients had grade 3/4 anemia. Nonhematologic toxicity was grade 3 acute renal failure in two patients; grade 3 electrolyte wasting in two patients; grade 3 nausea/vomiting in eight patients; grade 3 elevation of aminotransferases in one patient; and grade 3 diarrhea in one patient. There were no occurrences of severe mucositis, cardiotoxicity, or treatment-related deaths. Nine patients achieved a complete remission; seven of these patients remain without evidence of disease at 25+, 27+, 29+, 44+, 45+, 46+, and 48+ months. One patient remains alive with stable pulmonary nodules at 28+ months. CONCLUSION: CIS-EPI is an active regimen in metastatic GCT, with an acceptable toxicity profile. This regimen offers potential for long-term disease-free survival in this population.",M2

METHODS: EPI-PLA-MS was prepared with double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Five groups of mice (n = 8 in each group) were intraperitoneally injected with five different doses of free epirubicin (FEPI), and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was calculated. Then 15 mice with transplanted subcutaneous H22 HCC were divided into three groups (n = 5), which were respectively intratumorally injected with normal saline (NS), blank microspheres, and EPI-PLA-MS (with 9 mg/kg of EPI). After two weeks the tumors were excised and weighed. Another 15 mice with transplanted H22 ascites HCC were divided into three groups (n = 5), which were intraperitonealy injected with the same drugs, and the increased life span were registered exactly. RESULTS: The MTD of intraperitoneally injected FEPI was 9 mg/kg. The tumour-inhibiting rates was 40.35% and 36.09% when EPI-PLA-MS were administered by intratumoral injection to the mice with subcutaneous H22 HCC. It significantly prolonged the survival time of mice with H22 ascites HCC and the increased life span by 153.49% and 142.22% when EPI-PLA-MS were intraperitoneally administered. CONCLUSION: EPI-PLA-MS is a new sustained-release preparation with high-efficacy and low-toxicity in treating HCC and has shown promising prospects when administered locally.",M2

17084017,"A chemosensitivity test for superficial bladder cancer based on three-dimensional culture of tumour spheroids.OBJECTIVES: Three-dimensional (3D) spheroids are a good model for studying in vitro chemosensitivity because they reproduce unicellular and multicellular mechanisms of drug resistance. We aimed to develop a chemosensitivity test for intravesical drugs and to also verify the effects of verapamil (VPM) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO). METHODS: Cold cup biopsies from 40 superficial bladder tumours were taken, fragmented, and left in culture. 3D-spheroids were obtained and transferred into a 24 multiwell dish containing (1) wells 1-3: 1 mg/ml epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>); (2) 4-6: 1 mg/ml EPI+0.5 mg/ml VPM; (3) 7-9: 1 mg/ml adriamycin (ADR); (4) 10-12: 1 mg/ml thiotepa (THIO); (5) 13-15: 1 mg/ml mitomycin C (MMC); (6) 16-18: 1mg/ml EPI+0.2 mg/ml CIPRO; (7) 19-21: 0.2 mg/ml CIPRO; (8) 22-24: controls. Sensitivity was calculated by using the trypan blue assay. RESULTS: Evaluability of clinically relevant tests (G1-G2 lesions) was 84% (21 of 25 patients). MMC was the best agent (p&lt;0.001) with mean sensitivity being 50%, followed by THIO (37%), EPI (7%), and ADR (3%). We found no significant difference (p=0.370) between CIPRO and the control, or between EPI+CIPRO and EPI alone (p=0.550). VPM markedly enhanced sensitivity to EPI compared with EPI alone (97% vs. 7%, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our assay allows determining sensitivity to several drugs in superficial bladder tumours. It might be used in clinical practice to select the best drug for each patient. It also has experimental utility in investigating the effect of new drugs or combinations. VPM reverted resistance to EPI. CIPRO showed no effect on bladder tumour spheroids.",M2
16767928,"Epirubicin and its metabolites levels in experimental liver metastases after different administration routes.Locoregional chemotherapy in the 80's was considered an effective palliative treatment for unresectable hepatic metastases. With the advent of new drugs supporting effective systemic chemotherapy it was disregarded for many years. Recently, following the advent of new drugs and the developing of new association scheme, it has regained interests also for its adjuvant and neoadjuvant role to hepatic resections. Current schemes of locoregional and systemic chemotherapy for liver metastases are based on continuous infusions using implantable pumps but confirmation, in term of tissue drug concentration, that continuous infusions do better than bolus infusions is still lacking. To address this specific aspect we have experimentally compared these two different administration modalities using an anthracyclin, Epiadryamicin (<e>EPI</e>), with high plasmatic clearance and main biliary escretion (8,16) and infused through arterial, portal and systemic routes. The most high EPI concentration within the tumour was obtained after bolus-arterial infusion but also for continuous infusions the artery resulted better than other routes. Differently the most high EPI liver concentration resulted after portal infusion both if infused with a bolus or in 5 minutes time. This experiment may therefore legitimate the clinical use of this drug with bolus repeated infusions through the hepatic artery.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The degrees of growth inhibition of EPI-resistant HLE-EPI cells and MIT-resistant HLE-MIT cells by anticancer drugs were measured. The mRNA expressions of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)/ABCB1 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 were also measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, intracellular accumulation of EPI was investigated. RESULTS: HLE-EPI cells were resistant to EPI, MIT and docetaxel. HLE-MIT cells were resistant to EPI, MIT and SN-38. HLE-EPI cells overexpressed MDR1 and HLE-MIT cells overexpressed BCRP. The intracellular accumulation of EPI was decreased in HLE-EPI and HLE-MIT cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Viability of MCF-7 cells treated with EPI was measured using the MTT test. Glutathione (GSH), protein content and enzymatic activity were measured spectrophotometrically. NADPH - dependent cytochrome P-450 reductase (NADPH-CYP-450) and glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) expression in MCF-7 cells were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The IC50 values of EPI in MCF-7 cells were 1.0, 0.7 and 0.5 ng/ml respectively for 24, 48 and 72 h applications. Simultaneously enzymatic activity of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, GSH and expression of GST-pi, NADPH-CYP-450 reductase were increased in EPI (1 ng/ml) - treated cells at the end of the 24 h incubation. Addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase and GSH decreased cytotoxicity of EPI. CONCLUSION: We hypothesized that the production of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen peroxide as result of EPI treatment can cause cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells and antioxidant enzymes protect the cells against this process.",M2
16537185,"Randomized study of single instillation of epirubicin for superficial bladder carcinoma: long-term clinical outcomes.PURPOSE: Intravesical instillation of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) is one of the most effective adjuvant therapies for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer postoperation. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of single dose intravesical epirubicin for superficial bladder carcinoma recurrence. METHODS: Between June 1997 and May 1998, a total of 47 patients with resectable superficial bladder carcinoma (Ta-1, Grade 1-2), primary or recurrent with no recurrence during last one year, were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomized into 3 study groups: Group A-single epirubicin (80 mg/40 mL of normal saline) was administered into the bladder within 6 hours postoperation; Group B-40 mg Epirubicin consecutively; Group C-40 mg mitomycin C, consecutively. In Group B and C, instillation were given every week for 6- 8 weeks and then every one month for 10 months. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of treatment. The analyzed background factors were the therapeutic method, tumor recurrence, and side effects. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 43 (91.5 percent) were eligible and were followed up for 5 years postoperation. The disease free intervals of the three groups were found to have no significant differences (F = 10.28, p &gt; 0.05). The recurrence rates were 35.7 percent (5/14), 33.3 percent (5/15), and 40 percent (6/15), respectively (chi(2)= 0.83, p &gt; 0.05). Side effects of group A (13.6 percent) was lower than that of Group B or C (53.3 percent and 46.7 percent, respectively) significantly (chi(2) test, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that single dose of epirubicin instillation postoperation can reduce the recurrence of superficial bladder carcinoma and has low side effects.",M2

16465545,"Population analysis of the pharmacokinetics and the haematological toxicity of the fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen in breast cancer patients.PURPOSE: The aims of the study were (a) to characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK), including inter-individual variability (IIV) and inter-occasion variability (IOV) as well as covariate relationships and (b) to characterise the relationship between the PK and the haematological toxicity of the component drugs of the fluorouracil (5-FU)-epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>)-cyclophosphamide (CP) regimen in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 140 breast cancer patients, either within one of different studies or in routine clinical management, were included in the analyses. The patients were all treated with the fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen every third week for 3-12 courses, either in standard doses, i.e. 600/60/600 mg/m(2) of 5-FU, EPI and CP, respectively, or according to a dose escalation/reduction protocol (tailored dosing). PK data were available from 84 of the patients, whereas time-courses of haematological toxicity were available from 87 patients. The data analysis was carried out using mixed effects models within the NONMEM program. RESULTS: The PK of 5-FU, EPI and 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide (4-OHCP), the active metabolite of CP, were described with a one-compartment model with saturable elimination, a three-compartment linear model and a two-compartment linear model, respectively. No clinical significant correlation was found between PK across drugs. The unexplained variability in clearance was found to be less within patients, between courses (inter-occasion variability, IOV) than between patients (inter-individual variability, IIV) for EPI and 5-FU. For 4-OHCP, however, the IIV diminished by approximately 45% when significant covariates were included and the final population model predicts an IIV that is equal to IOV. Significant covariates for elimination capacity parameters were serum albumin (5-FU, EPI and 4-OHCP), creatinine clearance (5-FU), bilirubin (EPI) and body surface area (BSA) (4-OHCP). Elimination capacity of 5-FU and EPI was not related to BSA and for none of the studied drugs did body weight explain the PK variability. The time-course of haematological toxicity after treatment was well described by a semi-physiological model that assumes additive haematological toxicity between CP and EPI with negligible contribution from 5-FU. The influence of G-CSF could be incorporated into the model in a mechanistic manner as shortening the maturation time to 43% of the normal duration and increasing the mitotic activity to 269% of normal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The models presented describe the dose-concentration-toxicity relationships for the FEC therapy and may provide a basis for implementation and comparison of different individualisation strategies based on covariates, therapeutic drug monitoring and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) feedback. The PD model extends on previous semi-mechanistic models in that it also takes G-CSF administration into account.",M2
16455756,"Nitric oxide modulates proapoptotic and antiapoptotic properties of chemotherapy agents: the case of NO-pegylated epirubicin.The use of the anthracycline epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) is limited by the risk of a dilatory congestive heart failure that develops as a consequence of induction of a mitochondrial-dependent cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) increases the antitumoral activity of several chemotherapics, while it provides protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress both in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the addition of an NO-releasing moiety to a pegylated derivative of EPI (p-EPI-NO) confers to the drug a different cytotoxic profile against tumoral and normal cells. The cytotoxic profile of the drugs was investigated in Caco-2 cell line, in embryonic rat heart-derived myoblasts (H9c2), in adult cardiomyocytes, and in endothelial cells (HUVEC). p-EPI-NO was more efficient than EPI in inducing Caco-2 cell apoptosis, while it spared HUVEC, H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes from EPI-induced toxicity. Exposure of cells to p-EPI-NO resulted in a NO-mediated inhibition of cellular respiration followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell death in Caco-2 cells but not in HUVEC and H9c2 cells in which mitochondrial membrane polarization was maintained at the expense of glycolytically generated ATP. These findings indicate that addition of an NO-releasing moiety to p-EPI increases the anti-neoplastic activity of the drug, while it reduces its cytotoxicity against nonneoplastic cells.",M2
16444936,"Conservative treatment of high grade superficial bladder tumours.AIM OF THE STUDY: To review our previous experience in the treatment of high grade superficial bladder tumour. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 71 consecutive patients (12 women and 59 men) with high grade (G3) superficial (Ta-T1) bladder tumour were considered. After endoscopic treatment 31 patients received intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), 14 patients were treated with a combined scheme of intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy and respectively 3 patients and one patient with intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin (MMC) or epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) alone. A group of 16 patients received no further treatment after TUR and other 6 patients was treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients were followed up with urine cytology and cystoscopy every three months, renal sonography every six months and intravenous pyelography every 2 years or in the case of positive cytology associated with negative cystoscopy. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients treated with TUR alone 11 recurred (69%) BCG was initiated in 31 patients and 12 out of them suffered recurrences (42%), whereas 7 out of 14 patients who had combined epirubicin/BCG therapy developed recurrences (50%). Out of 19 patients who recurred after treatment with BCG alone or combined with epirubicin, five underwent immediate cystectomy and other five delayed cystectomy after a second course of intravesical therapy. In the latter group higher pathological stages were observed. We were not able to identify any factor predictive of recurrence after BCG treatment: sex (M 16/40 vs F 3/5 p = 0.35), stage (Ta 1/6 vs T1 18/39 p = 0.11), associated carcinoma in situ (CIS) (No CIS 1/8 vs CIS 18/37 p = 0.11), multifocal (single 13/31 vs multiple 6/14 p = 1.00), age (66.8 +/- 7.8 vs 62.9 +/- 11.9 years p = 0.19) and number of previous recurrences (0.42 +/- 0.90 vs 1.31 +/- 2.16 p = 0.06). Under chemotherapy (MMC or EPI) all 4 treated patients suffered recurrences (100%). Out of all recurrent patients after conservative treatment of an high grade superficial bladder tumours, seven presented tumours with a low grade histology (downgrading). In all but one of these patients an high grade tumour recurred within 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a correct strategy of intravesical metaphylaxis with BCG allows to spare cistectomy in up to 60% of the patients with high grade superficial bladder carcinoma and the optimisation of treatment protocols will lead to even more effective results. However this tumour still demands the highest level of attention in the follow up and in the case of recurrence primary conservative treatment with BCG should be promptly converted to radical surgical treatment considering that the development of less invasive surgical procedures has reduced the impact on the patient's quality of life",M2
16410696,"[Pilot study of primary systemic chemotherapy with docetaxel (DOC), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and capecitabine (Xeloda) in patients with advanced breast cancer]We evaluated the safety and efficacy of primary systemic chemotherapy (PSC) with docetaxel (DOC), epirubicin (EPI) and capecitabine (Xeloda:XLD) in 10 patients with advanced breast cancer. Their mean age was 54.7 years,and preoperative stages were IIB, seven cases; IIIA, two; and IV, one,respectively. The regimen consisted of XLD (2,400 or 3,000 mg/day) orally for 14 consecutive days, and DOC (60 or 70 mg/m2) and EPI (50 or 60 mg/m2) intravenously on day 8. This was repeated 4 times every 3 weeks. One patient discontinued this regimen after one course at her own request. Although the results revealed leucopenia and neutropenia of more than grade 3 in 8 and 10 patients,they could be treated on an outpatient basis with the use of G-CSF to maintain this regimen. Alopecia of grade 2 was found in all patients,neutropenic fever of more than 38.5 degrees C in 5,and hand-foot syndrome in 3. Downstaging after PSC was demonstrated in 7 cases (Stage IIB to I, three cases; IIB to IIA, three; and III A to I, one), with a response rate of 77.8%. Breast conserving therapy was performed in 8/10 patients. Pathological findings on cytological degeneration showed grade 0, one; grade 1a,seven; grade 2, one; and grade 3, one, respectively. Axillary lymph node metastasis was revealed in 7 cases. This regimen would be an alternative to PSC on an outpatient basis while taking great care of myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome.",M2
16363709,"[Invasive bladder cancer recurrenced 5 years after complete response status by chemotherapy and radiotherapy: a case report]A 72-year-old man had undergone trasucethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) three times from 1990 to 1991 and he had been lost to follow with no recurrence from 1996, came to our hospital complaining of asymptomatic macrohematuria in May 1999. A bladder tumor existed around the right ureteral orifice with right hydronephrosis. MRI and TUR-Bt revealed that the cancer was transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) &gt; small cell carcinoma, G3, pT3b. Because the patient insisted on bladder preservation, intra arterial chemotherapy with cisplatinum (CDDP) and epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>-adr) followed by radiotherapy with CDDP was performed. The treatment resulted in a clinical complete response (CR), and the bladder was preserved. In January 2004, an invasive bladder cancer recurred at the left lateral wall. This time, neoadjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy with CDDP and EPI-adr, followed by radical cystectomy was performed. Histologically, the recurrent bladder cancer was TCC, G3, pT3b.",M2
16361156,"[Therapeutic effect of TAX combined with Herceptin or epirubicin against breast cancer positive for Her-2/neu]OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of biochemotherapy regimen with Herceptin plus taxol (TAX) and the chemotherapy regimen with epirubicin plus TAX against Her-2/neu-positive breast cancer and observe the changes in serum tumor markers in patients receiving biochemotherapy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with advanced breast cancer positive for Her-2/neu as revealed by immunohistochemistry were divided into the study group (n=32) to receive treatment with the regimen of Herceptin plus TAX and control group (n=41) with the regimen of epirubicin(<e>EPI</e>) plus TAX. The therapeutic effects of the regimens were observed and in the study group, the relationship of the therapeutic effect with Her-2/neu positivity and changes in serum tumor markers were examined. RESULTS: The objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate were obviously higher in the study group than in the control group. In the study group, the clinical response rate of patients with positive immunostaining for Her-2/neu of grades 1+, 2+ and 3+ were 0%, 44.4% and 63.6%, respectively, as compared with those in the control group of 8.3%, 36.4%, and 38.9%, respectively, and the treatment resulted in lowered levels of serum tumor markers without significant changes in CA153, tps and CEA (P&lt;0.05) after treatment, but CA125 showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced breast cancer with positive immunostaining for Her-2/neu of grade 3+, the regimen of Herceptin plus TAX can be more effective than the chemotherapeutic regimen of EPI plus TAX. Patients with Her-2/neu (+++) benefit more from the treatment than those with Her-2/neu (++). Serum CEA, CA153 and TPS levels also possess some value in evaluating the therapeutic effects of the regimens.",M2
16351809,"[Impact of preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy on relapse and metastasis of breast cancer and its mechanism]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Although it is reported that lymphatic chemotherapy could raise drug concentrations in local lymph nodes and prolong survival time of patients with gastrointestinal tumors, its effect on breast cancer has not been explored. This study was to explore the impact of lymphatic chemotherapy on relapse and metastasis of breast cancer, and to investigate the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stage II-III were randomized into 2 groups: 40 patients in <e>Epi</e>-CH (carbon activated absorbing epirubicin) group were injected with 10 mg of Epi-CH in the tissue around primary tumor 72 h before modified radical resection; 20 patients in control group were injected with 10 mg of aqueous epirubicin in the same region. The stained nodes full of tumor cells in Epi-CH group and non-stained nodes in control group were selected. The apoptotic index (AI) of cancer cells in metastatic axillary lymph node was calculated by TUNEL method; the expression of Fas/Fas-L proteins was examined by SP immunohistochemistry; the relapse and metastatic rate was compared. RESULTS: The AI of cancer cells in metastatic axillary lymph node was significantly higher in Epi-CH group than in control group [(9.5+/-2.7)% vs. (3.8+/-1.4)%, P&lt;0.01]. The expression of Fas protein was significantly higher in Epi-CH group than in control group (P&lt;0.05), but the expression of Fas-L protein had no difference between the 2 groups (P&gt;0.05). No chemotherapy-related local and whole body reaction occurred in both groups. The relapse and metastatic rate was significantly lower in Epi-CH group than in control group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Preoperative Epi-CH lymphatic chemotherapy could suppress relapse and metastasis of breast cancer, which might through up-regulating expression of Fas protein and inducing apoptosis of axillary metastasis cells.",M2
16315941,"[A case of breast cancer detected by MRI mammography after Hollywood syndrome]A-64-year-old woman, who had been treated with augmentation mammaplasty 40 years ago, came to our hospital complaining of left breast pain. The mass was ill-defined, located in the upper outer quadrant area of her breast, and was 2 cm in diameter. MRI examination showed that the tumor had a spiculation and an irregular edge. There were no regional lymph nodes in her axilla and supra-subscapular. The diagnosis was Class IV by the fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology. We diagnosed the left breast cancer being in T2N0M0, Stage IIA, then we carried out Bt (Auchincloss method) and Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). There were metastatic cancer cells in the sentinel lymph node. So, we added level II lymph nodes dissection. The histological diagnosis was papillotubular carcinoma, f+, n+ (8/11). The endocrine receptor status of the tumor was ER+, PgR+ and the HER2/neu score was 0. There was paraffinoma in the non-cancer area. We dosed 6 cycles of FEC chemotherapy (CPA 800 mg, <e>EPI</e> 80 mg, 5-FU 750 mg/body x 1 cycle). We recognized no side effects of the chemotherapy for the patient.",M2
16109560,"[Effect of preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy on Bcl-2 and Bax expression in axillary metastasis of breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and cell apoptosis induced by preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy with epirubicin-activated carbon suspension (<e>Epi</e>-CH) in the cells of axillary metastatic lymph node of breast cancer and investigate the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stages II-III were randomly divided into two groups. Forty patients in Epi-CH group were injected with 10 mg Epi-CH in the tissue around the primary tumor or biopsy excision 72 h before operation. Twenty patients in the control group were injected with 10 mg epirubicin solution in the same region. The stained lymph nodes full of tumor cells in Epi-CH group and the non-stained nodes in the control group were selected for apoptotic detection by TUNEL method. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were examined by SP immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The apoptotic index of the metastatic cancer cells in Epi-CH group was increased remarkably in comparison with that in the control group [(9.5+/-2.7) % vs (3.8+/-1.4) %, P&lt;0.01). Compared with the control group, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were up-regulated significantly in Epi-CH group (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01, respectively), resulting in decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. CONCLUSION: Lymphatic chemotherapy can promote cell apotosis in axillary metastasis of breast cancer, which may result from decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.",M2
16005435,"Modulation of epirubicin cytotoxicity by tamoxifen in human breast cancer cell lines.The present study was designed to investigate the modulatory effect of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen (Tam) on epirubicin (<e>Epi</e>) cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines; MCF-7 and NCI-adr. Using sulphorhodamine-B assay, NCI-adr cell line was found to be five-folds more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of Epi as compared to MCF-7 cell line. Pretreatment of cells with Tam was observed to enhance Epi cytotoxicity by 4.3- and 6.5-folds in MCF-7 and NCI-adr cells, respectively. Tam-Epi interaction was found to be additive in MCF-7 cells and synergistic in NCI-adr cells. Flowcytometric DNA ploidy analysis revealed that, Epi induced cell arrest at G2/M phase. Tam pretreatment enhanced the blocking activity of low dose of Epi in MCF-7 and induced nearly two-fold increase in the percentage of S phase in NCI-adr cells. Determination of cellular Epi level revealed that Tam induced a significant increase in intracellular Epi accumulation only in NCI-adr cells after 48 h. However, analysis of P-gp function revealed that Tam failed to modulate P-gp function in both cell lines. Also, assessment of topoisomerae IIalpha gene expression showed that neither Epi nor Tam managed to change its expression level. In conclusion, Tam potentiates Epi cytotoxicity in sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell lines. This potentiation can be explained by an enhancement of cell accumulation in S and G2/M phase, at which the cells are most sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of Epi as well as an increase in the intracellular level of Epi in resistant cell line.",M2
15947110,"Cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity of the single agent epirubicin versus epirubicin plus tamoxifen as primary chemotherapy in human breast cancer: a single-institution phase III trial.This study was designed to address whether simultaneous primary chemo-hormonal therapy provides additional activity compared with chemotherapy alone in breast cancer patients with operable or locally advanced disease. Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2-4, N0-1, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (<e>EPI</e>) or epirubicin plus tamoxifen (EPI-TAM). Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of &gt;50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI-TAM arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER-) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P&lt;0.01). Both EPI and EPI-TAM treatments resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI-TAM arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post-operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER- status were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",M2
15685929,"Combined effect of epirubicin and lymphokine-activated killer cells on the resistant human breast cancer cells.Accumulating evidence suggests the concept that epirubicin and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells cytotoxicity may be mediated by free radicals generation and P-glycoprotein-positive (Pg-p+) cancer cells are more sensitive for LAK cells than their drug-sensitive parental lines. We tested this hypothesis further by exposing drug-sensitive (WT) and epirubicin-resistant MCF-7 human breast tumor cells to epirubicin and LAK cells. Subsequently, we monitored cell proliferation as a measure of cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of epirubicin, LAK, and LAK + epirubicin (1/10 of IC50) was evaluated in 400-fold epirubicin resistant MCF-7 <e>EPI</e>(R) (P-glycoprotein overexpressing) and drug-sensitive MCF-7 WT cells. IC50 values were measured using the MTT cytotoxicity test. The MCF-7 EPI(R) cells exhibited an increased susceptibility to LAK cells than did the MCF-7 WT cells. P-gp+ MCF-7 EPI(R) cells were lysed by human LAK cells to a greater extend than were their drug-sensitive counterparts. LAK + epirubicin combined treatment increased susceptibility of MCF-7 WT and MCF-7 EPI(R) cells to LAK cells cytotoxicity. For both cell lines, cytotoxicity was dependent upon the concentration of the epirubicin and effector cell/target cell (E/T) ratio. The resistance of MCF-7 EPI(R) cells to epirubicin appears to be associated with a developed tolerance to superoxide, most likely because of a tree-fold increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and 13-fold augmented selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Acting in concert, these two enzymes would decrease the formation of hydroxyl radical from reduced molecular oxygen intermediates. The addition of SOD decreased cytotoxicity of epirubicin and LAK cells. Taken together, these observations support the role of oxygen radicals in the cytotoxicity mechanism of epirubicin and suggest further that the development of resistance to this drug by the MCF-7 EPI(R) tumor cells may have a component linked to oxygen free radicals. It is proposed that production of reactive oxygen species by the treatment of epirubicin and LAK cells can cause cytotoxicity of MCF-7 WT and MCF-7 EPI(R) cells. SOD, catalase, GSH-Px, GST (glutathione S-transferase), and GSH (reduced glutathione) must be considered as part of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism of MCF-7 WT and MCF-7 EPI(R) cells against reactive oxygen species.",M2
15650840,"Stability of the HER2 gene after primary chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.We investigated whether alterations of the Her2 gene could be detected in breast cancer samples following primary chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. The prospective study involved 23 patients with stage-II, -III or -IV breast cancer. All patients were treated with two to six cycles of fluorouracil-epirubicin and/or cyclophosphamid/<e>epi</e>-docetaxel. The Her2 protein and gene were assessed both on core needle biopsies prior to and on surgical specimens after completing chemotherapy using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) were also determined on both samples using IHC. Her2 status was modified in eight patients using IHC (35%) and in three patients using FISH (13%). Changes in ER/PR expression were detected in seven patients (30%). Our data suggest that alterations of the Her2 gene can occur, although not usually after primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, changes in ER/PR status seem to be a more common event; thus, both can lead to different therapeutic options. Intratumoral heterogeneity as well as sampling variations can contribute to modification of the Her2 status after primary chemotherapy.",M2
15630804,"Evaluation of cisplatin + 5-FU, carboplatin + 5-FU, and ifosfamide + epirubicine regimens using the micronuclei test and nuclear abnormalities in the buccal mucosa.In the present work, the micronuclei (MN) test was performed in buccal mucosal samples from patients with cancer, with (pre- and post-treatment) and without genotoxic chemotherapy (GC), identified micronucleated cells (MNC) and nuclear abnormalities (binucleated cells (BN), pycnosis (PN),  broken-egg  (BE), condensed chromatin (CC), karyorrhexis (KR), and karyolysis (KL). The objective was to evaluate the genotoxicity of cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), carboplatin (CBP) + 5-Fluorouracil, and ifosfamide (IFO) + epirubicine (<e>EPI</e>) regimens. The ifosfamide + epirubicine regimen described here produced a micronucleogenic effect, whereas the regimens using platinum compounds were cytotoxic for buccal mucosal cells, which probably explain the absence of increase of micronucleated cells in these samples compared with basal levels. In patients with cancer (with and without genotoxic chemotherapy), the numbers of MNC, PN, KR, total nuclear abnormalities and KL increased, together with a decrease in BN cells and CC. On the other hand, as consequence of the cytotoxicity of the drugs, the number of binucleated cells decreased and the number of karyolytic cells increased. These results could be used as a cytotoxicity marker in the future studies for different drugs.",M2

Although the results revealed leucopenia and neutropenia of more than grade 3 in 4/5 patients, no other adverse events were observed. The use of G-CSF was necessary to maintain this regimen, and the patients could be treated on an outpatient basis. Breast conserving therapy was performed in two patients. Pathological findings revealed Grade 2 and 3 cytological degeneration in two and one patients, respectively, and parasternal lymph node metastasis in one, but no axillary lymph node metastasis. These findings suggested satisfactory effects of this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients were randomly assigned after surgery to receive TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (TAM, n = 164), or EPI 30 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for six cycles plus TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (EPI-TAM, n = 174). In both arms, patients received radiotherapy, delivered after chemotherapy (CT) in the EPI-TAM group. RESULTS: The 6-year DFS rates were 69.3% with TAM and 72.6% with EPI-TAM (P = .14). The multivariate analysis shows a relative risk of relapse of 1.93 (95% CI, 1.70 to 2.17) with TAM compared with EPI-TAM (P = .005). The 6-year OS, related to disease progression, was 79.1% and 79.8%, respectively (P = .41). Compliance with CT was good: 96.9% of patients received six cycles. The acute toxicity per patient was mild: grade 2 neutropenia in 5.9%, grade 2 anemia in 2.0%, grade 3 nausea or vomiting in 4.6%, and grade 3 alopecia in 7.2%. Five cases (in five patients) of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after CT: three after adjuvant CT, and two after anthracycline-based CT for relapse. One patient died as a result of dysrhythmia related to carcinomatous lymphangitis. No secondary leukemia occurred. CONCLUSION: This study conducted in node-positive elderly patients demonstrates a significant contribution of a weekly EPI regimen in terms of DFS.

15355645,"[Experimental study of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents for human endometrial carcinoma cell line]OBJECTIVE: To screen the sensitive chemotherapeutic agents to human endometrial carcinoma cell line-1 (HECCL-1) and study its mechanism. METHODS: MTT method was used to examine the relative inhibition ratios (RIRs) of various concentrations of 18 chemotherapeutic agents to HECCL-1. Cell cycle, apoptosis and expression of MDR1 protein were detected by FCM. RESULTS: Nine of the chemotherapeutic agents studied obviously inhibited the proliferative activity of HECCL-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The order of sensitivity was as follows: adriamycin (ADM), oxaliplatin (L-OHP), carboplatin (CBP), cisplatin (DDP), taxol (TAL), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), mitoxantrone (MIT), dactomycin (ACTD) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). FCM showed these agents could significantly reduce the proportion of cells in G0-G1 phase, and increase the proportion of cells in S and G2-M phase (P &lt; 0.05). Cell apoptosis was observed in 11 chemotherapeutic agents at their peak concentration. MDR expression was induced after using EPI, 5-Fu, hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and MIT. CONCLUSION: HECCL-1 is sensitive to a number of the chemotherapeutic agents studied. Induced apoptosis may be the major mechanism of drug sensitivity, and acquired drug-resistance may be the critical reason against continued administration.",M2

METHODS: The stop-flow technique was realized by using percutaneous double-balloon arterial-venous catheters that selectively isolate the pelvic vascular section and a perfusion provided by an extracorporeal pump for 20 min. Ten patients (pts) with unresectable pelvic recurrence from colon-rectal cancer were treated with a combination of Mitomycin C (MMC, 20 mg/sqm) plus doxorubicin (DOXO, 75 mg/sqm; 8pts) or epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>, 75 mg/sqm; 2pts) infused into the isolated pelvic compartment. Blood samples were collected from the extracorporeal vascular flow and from peripheral plasma, and analysed for drug quantitation. RESULTS: During the procedure, there were no technical or hemodynamic complications, and no deaths occurred during surgery or in the postoperative period. MMC and DOXO peak levels measured in the extracorporeal system which irrotates the tumor area, were on average 21.6 (range: 4.3-44.3, MMC) and 17.2 (range: 1.8-48.4, DOXO) times higher than those observed in the peripheral blood. Similarly; the area under concentration (AUC) versus time curves measured in the pelvic compartment during stop-flow perfusion were 19.9 (range: 3.8-45.0, MMC) and 13.4 (range: 1.2-26.6, DOXO) times higher than the corresponding value in peripheral circulation. The drug percentage eliminated in the ultra filtrate was only 7.7% (MMC) and 0.9% (DOXO), and the plasmatic AUC(0-24) were similar to those observed with iv bolus of equivalent drug doses. Minimal systemic and local toxicities were observed. One complete pathological and 2 partial responses were observed; pain remission in 8/10 patients. median survival was 12 months (8-31). CONCLUSION: The endo-arterial administration into the local vasculature produces high pelvic-systemic concentration gradients during the stop-flow perfusion with limited local and systemic toxicity. The encouraging clinical results suggest further evaluation.",M2

The major exclusion criteria were Tis or G3 tumours. Group A received 17 doses of EPI 20mg/40ml over a period of 12 months for a total dose of 340mg. In contrast, Group B received 12 doses of EPI 30mg/40ml over a period of 7 months, while Group C received 9 doses of EPI 40mg/40ml over a period of 4 months, both for a total dose of 360mg. This study enrolled a total of 622 patients diagnosed as having primary superficial bladder cancer during the period from June 1994 through November 1996 at the 118 institutions. Follow-up of the patients was conducted through October 1999. RESULTS: The relationship between the EPI concentration and the recurrence-free rate was evaluated by Tarone's test, and it was found that the recurrence-free rate became significantly higher as the drug concentration increased (p=0.0375). In the safety evaluation, with regard to adverse drug reactions, pollakiuria and pain on urination occurred at significantly higher incidences as the concentration of the EPI solution increased. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest effect of intravesical instillation of EPI after TUR-BT was shown by the regimen using the highest concentration of the drug solution which was administered during a short period of time.",M2
15014358,"Combination with liposome-entrapped, ends-modified raf antisense oligonucleotide (LErafAON) improves the anti-tumor efficacies of cisplatin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, docetaxel and gemcitabine.Raf-1 protein serine/threonine kinase plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell survival. We have previously described a novel cationic liposome-entrapped formulation of raf antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (LErafAON) and its use as a radiosensitizer. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of combination of LErafAON and a chemotherapeutic agent on growth of human prostate (PC-3) and pancreatic tumor xenografts in athymic mice (Aspc-1 and Colo 357). In PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, administration of a combination of LErafAON (i.v., 25 mg/kg/dose, x10/16) and cisplatin (i.v., 11.0 mg/kg/dose, x3), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) (i.v., 9.0 mg/kg/dose, x3) or mitoxantrone (MTO) (i.v., 2.5 mg/kg/dose, x3) led to enhanced tumor growth inhibition as compared with single agents (LErafAON+cisplatin versus cisplatin, p&lt;0.0002, n=8; LErafAON+EPI versus EPI, p&lt;0.0001, n=6; LErafAON+MTO versus MTO, p&lt;0.05, n=5). In prostate or pancreatic tumor-bearing mice, combination of LErafAON (i.v., 25 mg/kg/dose, x10/13) with docetaxel (Taxotere) (i.v., 5, 7.5 or 10 mg/kg/dose, x2/4) led to tumor regression or enhanced growth inhibition as compared with single agents (PC-3: LErafAON+Taxotere versus Taxotere, p&lt;0.02, n=7; Aspc-1: LErafAON+Taxotere versus Taxotere, p&lt;0.03, n=5; Colo 357: LErafAON+Taxotere versus Taxotere, p&lt;0.04, n=7). Combination of LErafAON (i.v., 25 mg/kg/dose, x10/13) with gemcitabine (i.v., 75 mg/kg/dose, x4/6) also caused a significant tumor growth inhibition in the two pancreatic carcinoma models studied (Aspc-1: LErafAON+gemcitabine versus gemcitabine, p&lt;0.0001, n=7; Colo 357: LErafAON+gemcitabine versus gemcitabine, p&lt;0.002, n =5). LErafAON treatment (i.v., 25 mg/kg/dose, x10) caused inhibition of Raf-1 protein expression in these tumor tissues (around 25-60%, n=4-7). Interestingly, Taxotere treatment per se also led to decreased steady state level of Raf-1 protein in PC-3 and Aspc-1 tumor tissues (i.v., 10 mg/kg/dose, x1 or 7.5 mg/kg/dose, x2; around 25-80%, n=2/6). Present studies demonstrate enhanced tumor growth inhibition or regression in response to a combination of a chemotherapeutic drug and LErafAON. These data provide a proof-of-principle for the clinical use of LErafAON in combination with chemotherapy for cancer treatment.",M2
15009365,"Sensitization of human renal cell carcinoma cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by anthracyclines.BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family. The present study investigated whether anthracyclines enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured using the microtiter assay. Apoptosis was monitored using DNA ladder analysis. Caspase activity was determined using a quantitative colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Treatment of ACHN and Caki-1 human RCC lines with TRAIL, in combination with subtoxic concentrations of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) or pirarubicin (THP), enhanced induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Sequential treatment with EPI followed by TRAIL induced significantly more cytotoxicity than the inverse treatment. The combined cytotoxicity of TRAIL and EPI was significantly inhibited by the TRAIL-neutralizing fusion protein DR5:Fc, although EPI did not affect the mRNA expression of DR4, DR5, DcR1 or DcR2. The combination treatment with TRAIL and EPI activated caspase-6 and -3, which were downstream molecules of the death receptor. Furthermore, the combined cytotoxicity of TRAIL and EPI was almost completely inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK, and partly inhibited by Ac-DMQD-CHO. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that anthracyclines sensitize RCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity through activation of caspases, suggesting that TRAIL, in combination with anthracyclines, has a therapeutic potential in the treatment of RCC.",M2
14977854,"Schedule-dependent cytotoxic interaction between epidoxorubicin and gemcitabine in human bladder cancer cells in vitro.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of epidoxorubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and gemcitabine (GEM) and to define the most effective schedule in human bladder cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study was performed on HT1376 and MCR cell lines. Cells were exposed for 1 and 24 h to drugs used in different schemes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated by the sulforhodamine B assay, potential clinical activity was estimated by relative antitumor activity, and the type of drug interaction was assessed using the method of Chou and Talalay. Cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry; BAX, BCL-2, and P53 expression was evaluated by Western blot; and DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline Comet assay. RESULTS: EPI and GEM produced a cytotoxic effect in both cell lines, with 50% inhibitory concentration and relative antitumor activity values suggestive of a high clinical activity. Simultaneous treatment with EPI and GEM and the sequence GEM--&gt;EPI caused an antagonistic interaction (combination index &gt; 1) after both 1- and 24-h treatments. Conversely, the inverse sequence, EPI--&gt;GEM, produced a synergistic interaction that was more pronounced in MCR cells than in HT1376 cells. The increase in DNA-damaged cells from 10% to 20% after single-drug exposure to 40-60% at the end of EPI--&gt;GEM treatment may explain the synergistic interaction produced by the anthracycline-antimetabolite sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the efficacy of the EPI and GEM combination is highly schedule dependent and indicate that the most active scheme is EPI followed by GEM, which is currently being validated in an ongoing intravesical Phase I-II clinical protocol.",M2
14656277,"The role of anthracyclines in second-line therapy of ovarian cancer.Anthracyclines (ANTs) have been in clinical practice since the 1960s and represent one of the most commonly used classes of anticancer drugs. In the 1990s, meta-analyses showed a favorable impact of doxorubicin (DOX/A) on the survival of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, when it was combined with cyclophosphamide and cisplatin (CAP) and compared to CP alone. With the acceptance of paclitaxel-carboplatin (TCb) as the new reference arm for first-line treatment, testing the addition of ANTs to TCb seems a logic next step. Trials presently testing this, make use of either epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD: Doxil(R)/Caelyx(R)). These are the two most favorable ANTs, based on data obtained with various ANTs in ovarian cancer failing platinum-based chemotherapy. EPI has not been evaluated in direct comparison with other antineoplastic agents. PLD has been compared with both paclitaxel and topotecan. No difference in efficacy parameters could be observed, but the toxicity profile of PLD scored favorably against those of the comparator in both trials, despite the fact that palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia can be troublesome, and sometimes lead to treatment discontinuation. Data from four randomized trials evaluating the role of ANT combinations in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer suggest that the addition of EPI or DOX to paclitaxel does not lead to better outcomes in patients with platinum- refractory or resistant disease. In platinum-sensitive disease, any benefit of EPI-platinum or DOX-platinum combinations over platinum alone is uncertain. There are no randomized trials with PLD combinations in the second-line setting. It is concluded that both EPI and PLD can be recommended as a reasonable single-agent treatment option for relapsed patients, with a preference for PLD taking into account its more favorable toxicity profile.",M2
14555529,"Changes in tumor vascularization after irradiation, anthracyclin, or antiangiogenic treatment in nitrosomethyl ureas-induced rat mammary tumors.PURPOSE: Changes in tumor vascularization may be involved in tumor regression after anticancer treatments. We therefore studied the relationship between tumor vascularization and tumor response according to treatment by irradiation (RT), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), or antiangiogenic agent TNP-470 in a nitrosomethyl-ureas-induced rat mammary tumor model by measuring the changes in tumor blood flow using high-frequency Power-Doppler sonography. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mammary tumors were induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by a single s.c. injection of nitrosomethyl-ureas. After tumor areas reached 2 cm(2), the animals received four weekly injections of epirubicin (EPI group), or a single fraction of 18 Gy (RT group), or six injections of TNP-470 within 12 days (TNP group), or both (RT combined with TNP-470, RT+TNP group). Power-Doppler sonography quantification of tumor vascularization (PDI) was performed before and 12 days after initiation of treatment. Tumor shrinkage was later evaluated and compared with the early changes in PDI values. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, EPI induced an arrest in tumor growth. A similar effect was obtained with TNP-470. There was a decrease in tumor area after RT, but administration of TNP-470 combined with RT did not further enhance this effect. Changes in tumor area paralleled changes in PDI in the EPI group. Furthermore, changes in PDI 7 days after RT were associated with further tumor change in the RT groups, whereas they were independent of the antitumor effect of TNP-470. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in functional tumor vascularization evolution appeared to be closely associated with tumor regression after anticancer treatment.",M2
14503796,"The differential effects of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil on apoptotic marker (CPP-32), pro-apoptotic protein (p21(WAF-1)) and anti-apoptotic protein (bcl-2) in breast cancer cells.Cyclophosphamide (CYC), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) are commonly used cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. The efficacy of these drugs in the induction of caspases (CPP-32), pro-apoptotic (p21(WAF-1)) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) proteins is tested in vitro on breast cancer cells lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The cell proliferation rate and the levels of CPP-32, p21(WAF-1) and bcl-2 are measured at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. For MDA-MB-231 all three drugs caused significant inhibition in cell growth. CYC produces significant induction of CPP-32 at 3-6 h for MCF-7 only. For MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, respectively, EPI induces CPP-32 at significant levels at 12-24 h and 6-12 h while 5FU creates induction for MDA-MB-231 at 3 h and for MCF-7 at 3-12 h. The levels of expression of p21(WAF-1) and bcl-2 for all test groups were significantly different from their respective control groups. In the case of MDA-MB-231, regression analysis reveals that changes in CPP-32 levels and p21(WAF-1) levels have a significant positive relationship. In all likelihood, other mechanisms of cell death are implicated in the antitumor effect of these drugs, beyond the activation of CPP-32 and p21(WAF-1) as described in this paper.",M2
12948826,"Evaluation of cisplatin + 5-FU, carboplatin + 5-FU, and ifosfamide + epirubicine regimens using the micronuclei test and nuclear abnormalities in the buccal mucosa.In the present work, the micronuclei (MN) test was performed in buccal mucosal samples from patients with cancer, with (pre- and post-treatment) and without genotoxic chemotherapy (GC), identified micronucleated cells (MNC) and nuclear abnormalities (binucleated cells (BN), pycnosis (PN),  broken-egg  (BE), condensed chromatin (CC), karyorrhexis (KR), and karyolysis (KL)). The objective was to evaluate the genotoxicity of cisplatin+5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), carboplatin (CBP)+5-Fluorouracil, and ifosfamide (IFO)+epirubicine (<e>EPI</e>) regimens. The ifosfamide+epirubicine regimen described here produced a micronucleogenic effect, whereas the regimens using platinum compounds were cytotoxic for buccal mucosal cells, which probably explains the absence of increase of micronucleated cells in these samples compared with basal levels. In patients with cancer (with and without genotoxic chemotherapy), the numbers of micronucleated cells, pycnosis and karyolysis increased, together with a decrease in binucleated cells and chromatin-condensed. On the other hand, as consequence of the cytotoxicity of the drugs, the number of binucleated cells decreased and the number of karyolytic cells increased. These results could be used as a cytotoxicity marker in future studies for different drugs.",M2
12948825,"Doxorubicin and two of its analogues are preferential inducers of homologous recombination compared with mutational events in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster.The genotoxic effects of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) and two of its analogues, epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and pirarubicin (THP) were studied using the wing Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. These compounds are classified as topoisomerase II (topo II) poisons, acting by stabilizing a topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complex. Using the standard version of the SMART test it was possible to estimate the quantitative and qualitative genotoxic effects of these compounds, comparing the wing spot frequencies in marker- and balancer-heterozygous flies. The results obtained indicate that all three compounds induce a high frequency of spots related to homologous recombination (HR), which is the major event responsible for their genetic toxicity. Pirarubicin was the most genotoxic anthracycline, inducing approximately 21 times more genetic lesions than doxorubicin, probably due to the presence of a second sugar ring in the amino sugar moiety in its chemical structure. Although the only difference between epirubicin and doxorubicin is the steric position of the amino sugar 4'-OH in the molecule, epirubicin is approximately 1.6 times as genotoxic as doxorubicin.",M2
12929575,"The effects of epirubicin hydrochloride (<e>EPI</e>) plus pretreatment of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on FM3A breast cancer cells transplanted in female C3H/He mice.BACKGROUND: Little is known about how breast cancer cells are affected by the different regimens of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) hormone therapy in combination with epirubicin (EPI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of EPI with and without MPA pretreatment was compared when used on FM3A mouse breast cancer (FM3A) cells transplanted in female C3H/He mice. The effects of these regimens on angiogenesis induced by FM3A tumor were evaluated. RESULTS: A significant enhancement of the effects of EPI on the growth of FM3A cells by continuous MPA treatment was observed. The continuous treatment of MPA with EPI was most effective in the inhibition of angiogenesis in the tumors in all regimens tested. CONCLUSION: The combination of MPA pretreatment with EPI may be more effective than the simultaneous treatment of MPA with EPI for breast cancer. In addition, the results suggest that the anti-angiogenic effects of MPA combined with EPI on FM3A cells are parallel with the anti-tumor effects.",M2
12845646,"Influence of drug-induced apoptotic death on processing and presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells.Here we have studied the effects of apoptotic cell death induced by chemotherapic agents on tumor phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DC) and presentation of the relevant antigen to T lymphocytes. Annexin-V-FITC (Ann-V) and propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to assess early apoptotic (Ann-V(+)/PI(-)) vs. late apoptotic/secondary necrotic (Ann-V(+)/PI(+)) death after a 24 hr observation of untreated and drug-treated gastric carcinoma cells. After treatments, the HLA-A*0201(+) tumor cell line KATO III was exposed for 24 hr to allogeneic, HLA-related GM-CSF, IL-4-driven immature (i) DC. Tumor-loaded iDC were tested for IL-12 release in an ELISA assay, incubated with the DC-maturating factor TNF-alpha and used as stimulators for autologous T lymphocytes. Generation of antitumor T response against KATO cells was evaluated in an anti-MHC class I MAb-blocked Interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay. After treatment with Cis-platin (cis), all dying cells were in early apoptosis, whereas secondary necrosis was the prevalent death pattern observed after epirubicin (<e>epi</e>) and doxorubicin (doxo). Doxo and epi increased tumor expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and uptake of tumor cell components by DC, whereas cis treatment had no effect on hsp70 and was associated with poor tumor uptake by DC. Significant upmodulation of IL-12 was observed by DC that had taken up the doxo- and epi-treated tumors (p&lt; 0.005 and p&lt; 0.01, respectively). Increased IFN-gamma release was also observed after stimulation of T lymphocytes with DC loaded with doxo- and epi-treated (p&lt; 0.02 and p&lt; 0.005, respectively) but not with cis-treated DC. These data show that the products of early apoptosis cannot efficiently cross-activate MHC class I-restricted anti-tumor lymphocytes even in the presence of DC maturating factors, whereas secondary necrosis is associated with robust T cell response.",M2
12782942,"Escalating doses of paclitaxel and epirubicin in combination with cisplatin in advanced ovarian epithelial carcinoma: a phase I-II study.Our objective was to identify a new active three-drug combination regimen consisting of paclitaxel (PTX), epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and cisplatin as first-line line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma. A phase I study was carried out to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of PXT and EPI in combination with a fixed dose of cisplatin every 4 weeks. Side-effects were recorded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Patients were treated in cohorts of three with fixed-dose cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and EPI 80--&gt;100 mg/m2 and PXT 100--&gt;160 mg/m2 until DLT was reached. Once MTD was identified, a single-step phase II study was therefore carried out to test the clinical activity and panel of toxicity of such regimen. Objective responses were recorded according to the WHO criteria. Time to progression and overall survival (OS) were secondary endpoints. The DLT was myelosuppression and, in more detail, febrile neutropenia, which occurred at the fifth dose level (PTX 140 mg/m2, EPI 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin 80 mg/m2) in two out of three patients. Other side-effects were grade 3 mucositis in two out of three patients and grade 3 anemia in one case. The combination of cisplatin 80 mg/m2 plus EPI 80 mg/m2 and PCT 140 mg/m2 every 4 weeks was considered as the MTD. In the phase II study a complete response was observed in six patients (33%) and a partial response in nine cases (50%) for an overall response rate of 83% [95% confidence limits (CL) 59-96%]. Median time to progression of patients with measurable disease was 16.4 months. Median OS was not reached after a follow-up of 42 months. This study demonstrated that PTX and EPI can be safely administered in combination with cisplatin to fit patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The three-drug regimen of cisplatin 80 mg/m2, EPI 80 mg/m2 and PTX 140 mg/m2 every 4 weeks is very active, at least in terms of objective response rate. This level of activity overlaps with the 95% CL of the activity of cisplatin alone; however, it does encourage future trials of the combination.",M2
12648586,"Epirubicin and paclitaxel (<e>EPI</e>-TAX regimen) for advanced ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing regimens.BACKGROUND: The place of anthracyclines in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer remains a matter of debate. We have assessed the feasibility and evaluated the tolerance of epirubicin (EPI) combined with paclitaxel (TAX) in heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: Between March 1996 and March 1998, 34 patients with ovarian cancer in relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy received EPI (75 mg/m(2)/day, iv) and TAX (175 mg/m(2)/day, 3-h infusion). Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. This treatment was second-line for 10 patients and third/fourth-line for 24. RESULTS: Of the 34 assessable patients, 15 (44%) (95% confidence interval 27-60%) achieved objective response (3 complete and 12 partial responses). The number of previous lines of chemotherapy or previous anthracycline treatments did not influence response rates. Responders to previous paclitaxel-based regimens had a significantly higher response rate to EPI-TAX combination (57%) than nonresponders (11%) (P = 0.05). Median response duration was 40 weeks (range 12-94). Median survival from inclusion was 10.7 months (range 1-40). Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 31 patients (91%), febrile neutropenia episodes in 17%, and grade 3/4 anemia and thrombopenia in 27 and 24%, respectively. The main nonhematological toxicities included alopecia and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (12%). Cardiac dysfunction was observed in one patient after the fourth treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity of the EPI-TAX regimen was acceptable in this population of heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients. The regimen was effective and it is considered an option for patients previously responding to paclitaxel-based therapy.",M2
12557709,"[Early effect of intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with degradable starch microspheres for malignant hepatic tumors]The hepatic artery-embolizing effect of degradable starch microspheres (DSM) was assessed by dynamic CT scanning soon after embolization in patients with malignant hepatic tumors. Using the Seldinger method, DSM with a mixture of contrast medium, MMC, ADM or <e>Epi</e>-ADM was manually injected. The subjects were 32 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the liver (62 treatments) and 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(19 treatments) (47 patients received 81 treatments in all). Dynamic CT scanning was performed within 2 weeks of each embolization procedure, and the percent reduction in the area visualized (necrotic effect) was calculated to assess the efficacy of embolization. The necrotic effect of embolization was classified as CR, PR, NC, and PD after 9, 41, 10, and 2 treatments, respectively, in the patients with metastatic carcinoma of the liver and after 4, 6, 6, and 3 treatments, respectively, in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Although there was no patient in whom the tumor showed 50% or more reduction, the contrast enhanced area showed 50% or more decrease in 60 out of 81 treatments. Therefore, blocking of blood flow seemed to contribute more to the response than enhancement of the efficacy of the anticancer agents. Adverse reactions were all transient and controllable. Based on our results, intra-arterial chemotherapy plus DSM embolization seems to be useful for treating malignant hepatic tumors.",M2
12530029,"Gemcitabine plus <e>Epi</e>-doxorubicin as first-line chemotherapy for bladder cancer in advanced or metastatic stage: a phase II.Combination chemotherapy with newer, more active drugs in patients with advanced and/or metastatic bladder cancer might show improved response rate and survival. Gemcitabine (GEM) and Epidoxorubicin (EPI) have demonstrated activity in this disease. In addition, experimental studies in vitro have shown that the two agents have additive-synergistic effects when used in combination. Our prior phase I dose-finding study in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer defined recommended doses for further trials of GEM 1000 mg/m2 and EPI 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days. A phase II trial at this dose level was initiated in previously untreated patients to assess efficacy and toxicity. Eligible patients had measurable disease; Karnofsky performance status (PS) of &gt; 40; no prior chemotherapy; and adequate bone marrow reserve, cardiac, hepatic and renal function. Thirty- one patients (22 males, 9 females) with median age of 64 (range 44-75) and median PS of 80 were accrued, and all were eligible. Twelve patients had T4N1-2 M0, 8 had lymph node only metastases, while 11 had visceral metastases (liver, bone, lung). A total of 181 cycles was administered (range 3-7 per patient). Major toxicities (WHO grade &gt; or = 3) were: neutropenia in 5 patients, thrombocytopenia in 2 patients, and anemia in 2 patients. Three patients had febrile neutropenic episodes and only 3 patients required dose reduction. Grade 1-2 non-hematological toxicities included nausea/vomiting, stomatitis and alopecia. No cardiac toxicity was observed. Of the 30 response evaluable patients, 17 (57%) demonstrated a major response (3 complete and 14 partial) (95% CI: 39%-75%), 7 had stable disease (23%) and 6 progressed (20%). These preliminary results confirm the phase I observation that the combination of GEM--EPI is highly active in the treatment of advanced and metastatic bladder cancer with a favourable toxicity profile.",M2
12515634,"[Evaluation of two different regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of two different regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with stage II, III breast cancer as proved by cytology biopsy, were treated with either 5-Fu, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) or epirubicin, paclitaxel (ET) regimens for 2 cycles every 3 - 4 weeks. Clinical responses in the breast and lymph nodes were assessed after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in FEC arm received combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) 500 mg/m(2) by 4-hour continuous infusion on D1 and D8, epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) 50 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1, and cyclophosphamide (CTX) 500 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1 and D8. Patients assigned to the ET arm received EPI 60 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1, paclitaxel (TAX) 150 mg/m(2) by 3-hour continuous infusion on D2. All patients were treated by operation 2 weeks later and radiotherapy was added to some. RESULTS: For primary tumor in the breast, the overall response rate (RR) was 50.0% (12/24) in FEC arm and 79.2% (19/24) in ET arm. One patient showed clinical complete response (cCR), 11 partial response (PR), 12 no change (NC) after the FEC therapy, while 1 patient showed CR, 18 PR, 5 NC after ET therapy. There was no pathologic complete response or progressive disease, though a higher proportion of RR was observed in stage II than stage III patients in these two groups. Clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes which had been found in all 48 patients before 2 cycles of treatment, 50.0% (12/24) in the FEC patients and 66.7% (16/24) in the ET patients became in-palpable. The major toxicity, including leukopenia, gastroenteric reactions, were similar in both groups, but alopecia was more severe and arthralgia, myalgia, neurotoxicity and flushing of face were the unique features of the ET regimen. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two different regimens were effective to the primary tumor and axillary metastatic lymph nodes of breast cancer, and the side effects were tolerable. Higher efficacy and more side effects are observed in ET than in FEC regimen.",M2
12512965,"High-dose epirubicin and cisplatin in locally advanced undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.AIM: Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (UNPC) is a chemosensitive tumour; a randomized study evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin/epidoxorubicin/cisplatin (BEC) in addition to conventional radiotherapy has resulted in a better disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm. The bleomycin infusion in the BEC regimen has necessitated hospitalization for the infusion, and resulted in serious pulmonary toxicity. This study has aimed to omit the bleomycin, and test the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin (C) and a higher dose of epidoxorubicin (<e>EPI</e>) in patients with locally advanced UNPC. METHODS: Seventy-one patients with locally advanced UNPC were treated with three cycles of C 100 mg/m2 day 1, and EPI 100 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks followed by conventional radiotherapy of 70 Gy. RESULTS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was well tolerated. There was only 1-week delay in 14.3% of the patients and no dose modification. Grade III-IV neutropenia occurred in 18.9% of the cycles: none of the patients developed neutropenic fever. No patient progressed during chemotherapy, the complete response rate was 26.8% (95% CI = 16.9-38.6) and the partial response rate was 59.1% (95% CI = 46.8-70.7) for an objective response rate of 85.9% (95% CI = 75.6-93.0) at the end of the three cycles of chemotherapy. After the completion of radiotherapy, the complete response rate increased to 81.7% (95% CI = 70.7-89.9) and the objective response increased to 91.5% (95% CI = 82.5-96.8). The median disease-free interval and the median survival have not been reached. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates are 53.0% (95% CI = 43.7-62.0) and 57.2% (95% CI = 48.3-65.2), respectively. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant C and EPI, easily administered in the outpatient setting, is an effective and well-tolerated regimen in the treatment of locally advanced UNPC.",M2
12447951,"Randomized study comparing 4'-<e>epi</e>-doxorubicin (epirubicin) versus doxorubicin as a part of induction treatment in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Doxorubicin or daunorubicin are routinely used to induce remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Efficacy of epirubicin (an analog of doxorubicin), however, has not been adequately evaluated in ALL management. This randomized study was undertaken to compare the relative efficacy of epirubicin vs. doxorubicin as part of induction chemotherapy in adult ALL. Between January 1990 and June 1998, 79 previously untreated adult ALL patients (age 11-55 years, median 20 years) were randomized to receive either doxorubicin (Group A, n = 39) or epirubicin (Group B, n = 40) as a part of induction therapy. Vincristine and prednisolone were common in each group. The induction treatment was followed by identical consolidation and maintenance therapy. The two groups were compared as regards pretherapy clinical and laboratory parameters, dose intensity of therapy, therapeutic efficacy, myelotoxicity, and survival. Epirubicin was as effective as doxorubicin in terms of complete remission rate (80% vs. 78.3%; P = 0.87) and relapse rate (57.1% vs. 51.7%; P = 0.68). Five-year overall survival (30% vs. 30%, P = 0.98) and disease-free survival (40% vs. 39%, P = 0.92) at median follow-up of 68 months was also similar in the two groups. The incidence of Grade 4 myelotoxicity was comparable in the two groups. Patients 20 years of age or less had better CR rates (90% vs. 65%; P = 0.011) and median overall survival (39 vs. 11 months; P = 0.008) compared to those who were older. From this study epirubicin appears as effective as doxorubicin as part of induction therapy for adult ALL. However, the results need to be validated on the basis of immunophenotype and cytogenetic prognostic characterization.",M2
12377958,"Time to progression in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin is not improved by the addition of either cisplatin or lonidamine: final results of a phase III study with a factorial design.PURPOSE: To investigate the value of the addition of either cisplatin (CDDP) or lonidamine (LND) to epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) in the first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy-one metastatic breast cancer patients with no prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomized to receive either EPI alone (60 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 every 21 days), EPI and CDDP (30 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 every 21 days), EPI and LND (450 mg orally daily, given continuously), or EPI, CDDP, and LND. Time to progression, response rates, side effects, and survival were compared according to the 2 x 2 factorial design of this study. RESULTS: The groups were well balanced with respect to prognostic factors. Time to progression did not differ in the comparison between CDDP arms and non-CDDP arms (median, 10.9 months v 9.4 months, respectively; P =.10) or between that of LND arms and non-LND arms (median, 10.8 months v 9.9 months, respectively; P =.47), nor did overall survival. The response rate did not significantly differ in the comparison between LND arms and non-LND arms (62.9% v 54.0%, P =.08). No difference in treatment activity was observed between CDDP arms and non-CDDP arms. Toxicity was significantly higher in the CDDP arms, leading to CDDP dose adjustment in 40% of cases. The most frequent side effects were of a hematologic and gastrointestinal nature. The addition of LND produced more myalgias and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Neither CDDP nor LND was able to significantly improve the time to progression obtained by EPI. CDDP, however, significantly worsened the drug's tolerability.",M2
12357299,"Intravesical adjuvant chemotherapy for superficial transitional cell bladder carcinoma: results of a randomized trial with epirubicin comparing short-term versus long-term maintenance treatment.PURPOSE: Intravesical instillation of epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) is one of the most effective adjuvant therapies for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer after transurethral resection. We evaluated the optimal duration of EPI instillation in a multi-institution prospective randomized clinical study. METHODS: Between June 1995 and May 1998, a total of 125 patients with superficial bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma grade 1 or 2) were enrolled in this study, and 102 patients were fully evaluated for recurrence. Two protocols for intravesical therapy (arm A - 30 mg EPI/30 ml saline 19 times over 1 year; arm B - 30 mg EPI/30 ml 12 times over 5 months) were established. Instillations were given every week for 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks for 4 months in arm B. After 5 months of treatment, maintenance was performed with seven further instillations (one every month for 7 months) in arm A. The analyzed background factors were the therapeutic method, gender, history (primary or recurrent tumor), stage (T classification), grade, number of tumors, and tumor size. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the analyzed background factors between the two arms, and there were no serious side effects in the study. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the overall 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 48.5% in arm A and 55.1% in arm B. The difference between the two groups was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicated that extended prophylactic maintenance instillation of EPI was not significantly effective in reducing bladder cancer recurrence.",M2
12297475,"Effect of dosage of anticancer agents during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization on T cell subsets in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the dosage of anticancer agents during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the T cell subsets in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with unresectable HCC were randomly divided into 2 groups to receive superselective TACE. Patients in group A (n=18) received low-dose (2-4 mg) mitomycin C (MMC) as the anticancer drug when the tumor was less than 5 cm in diameter; when the tumor ranged from 5 and 8 cm in diameter, 4-6 mg MMC along with 10 mg epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) was given, and in cases of even larger tumors, 6-8 mg MMC, 10 mg EPI and 100 mg CBP were prescribed. Conventional chemotherapy regimen constituted by 10 mg MMC, 40 mg PI and 300 mg CBP was adopted in group B (n=18). The peripheral blood T cell subsets including CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), NK, CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, CD4(+)CD45(+), CD4(+)CD29(+), CD8(+)CD28(+) and CD8(+)CD28- were measured by flow cytometry in both groups before and one week after treatment. RESULTS: The T cell subsets were comparable in the 2 groups before the treatment. After TACE, no significant changes occurred in CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), NK, CD4(+)/CD8(+), CD4(+)CD29(+) or CD8(+)CD28- cells in group A, while significant decrease in CD4(+)CD45(+) and increase in CD8(+)CD28(+) cells were observed (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In group B, CD4(+) and CD4(+)CD29(+) levels, together with CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, were significantly lower than those before treatment (P&lt;0.05), but CD8(+) and CD8(+)CD28- subsets were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The cellular immune function of HCC patients is significantly impaired by anticancer drugs for TACE at conventional dose, while low-dose of the drugs may enhance the cellular immune function.",M2
11810778,"[Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To study the value and indications of a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancers. METHODS: Forty-three breast cancer patients were given the NF neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (Navelbine 25 mg/m2 and 5-Fu 500 mg/m2) for 3 cycles before the operation. Epirubicin (<e>EPI</e> 40 mg/m2) was added in patients with locally advanced lesions. G-CSF 75 micrograms subcutaneous injection was used to increase the white count as needed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 95.0%. Pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy showed CR in 3 patients (7.5%) and PR in 35 patients (87.5%) even though 2 patients (5.0%) were refractory. The follow-up ranged from 4 to 37 months (median 20 months). All patients are alive though 4 have developed recurrence or metastasis. CONCLUSION: The pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may preferably be given in 3 cycles from which those who benefit most are the breast cancer patients with inoperable lesions and who are planned to undergo breast-preserving surgery.",M2

METHODS: Forty-two cases of advanced NSCLC patients (squamous-cell carcinoma, 28; adenocarcinoma, 12; undifferentiated cancer, 2) were treated with 2 cycles of VED. Serum sAPO-1/Fas level was determined by ELISA method, and NO level by enzymatic method before and after treatment. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 47.6% (20/42). Serum sAPO-1/Fas level in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma who responded to treatment was significantly lower than that before treatment. The post-chemotherapy serum NO level was significantly higher than that before chemotherapy in responsive patients with squamous-cell cancer as well as in adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Combination chemotherapy with VM-26, EPI and DDP can be useful in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Serum sAPO-1/Fas and NO levels could be used to monitor treatment effect.",M2

11695811,"Primary chemotherapy in stage IV ovarian cancer. A prospective phase II study.BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Non-curative surgical cytoreduction of advanced tumors is associated with increased proliferation of the remaining tumor cells. Thus, appropriate preoperative chemotherapy should prevent both cell proliferation and the increase of resistant cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of primary chemotherapy (P-CT) in previously untreated patients with stage IV ovarian cancer (OC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with stage IV OC were treated from January 1993 to April 2000 with P-CT. Eligibility criteria included: histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable stage IV OC and performance status &lt; or = 3. P-CT consisted of four courses of carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and epirubicin until October 1996, and paclitaxel, carboplatin thereafter. Surgery followed P-CT. After the operation patients received two further courses of chemotherapy that were tailored according to their individual response. Median (M) age was 61 years, range 32-73; median performance status was 2. A total number of 197 courses of CT were administered, median 5.7 per patient. RESULTS: Complete or partial response (CR, PR) was observed in 28 patients (response rate 82%, 95% CI: 65.4% to 93.2%), disease stability and progression (SD, PD) was observed in three and three patients, respectively. Median time to progression was 16.45 months (range 4.8-90.4+), median survival time was 28 months (range 4.5 - 90.4+): 1-year survival rate was 94%. Toxicity according to WHO: nausea and vomiting grade (G) 2, 30% of patients; gastrointestinal G 2-3, 20% of patients; alopecia G 3, 88% of patients; hematological G 3-4, 73% of patients; neurologic G 2, 12% of patients. Nine pathological CRs were observed. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant treatment with CBDCA with either CTX and <e>EPI</e> or Taxol is feasible and shows activity in OC.",M2
11694773,"Ifosfamide and epirubicin combination in untreated sarcomas: two treatment schedules.BACKGROUND: The Epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and ifosfamide (IFO) combination has been widely tested in soft tissue sarcomas, even though the optimal schedule of drug administration has still to be defined. In this article, we reviewed the activity and the toxicity of two EPI- and IFO-based schedules in newly diagnosed sarcomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 22 patients (group A) received a 'concurrent' schedule of short-infusion IFO at total dose of 7.5-9 g/m(2) over 5 days plus iv bolus EPI at 90-120 mg/m(2)/cycle, repeated every 3 weeks. The other 22 patients (group B) received a 'sequential' schedule of dose-intense, continuous infusion IFO at a total dose of 14-18 g/m(2) for 2 cycles followed by bimonthly EPI at 120-160 mg/m(2)/cycle. Application of growth factors was planned for each course of treatment. RESULTS: Since 1994, 44 consecutive patients have been treated. The overall response rate was 35% with no significant differences between the two treatment groups in terms of response rate (group A: 33%, group B: 37%), time to progression (group A: 7 months, group B: 8 months), and overall survival (group A: 12 months, group B: 15 months). General tolerance to treatment was better in group A. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred significantly more often with the sequential regimen. Severe hematologic toxicity was common but no toxic deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this limited experience, a concurrent schedule of EPI and IFO seems to be an appropriate management strategy in the front-line therapy of advanced sarcomas. Nevertheless, a randomized trial is warranted to define the optimal dosages to be used for further clinical trials.",M2
11561768,"Drug interactions and cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin, epirubicin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples.The purpose of this study was to analyze the drug interactions of paclitaxel (PTX) with epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>), carboplatin (CBDCA), gemcitabine (GEM) and vinorelbine (VIN) in human breast cancer cells and compare the cytotoxic activity of each drug combination in primary breast cancer samples. These experiments were intended to identify the most active agents in combination with PTX, and to provide a preclinical rational for future clinical investigations in breast cancer. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was applied to combinations of PTX with either CBDCA, EPI, GEM or VIN in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell lines. Drug concentrations were limited to the ranges achievable in humans in vivo, and the drugs were applied simultaneously at fixed molar ratios for each drug combination. Interactions were assessed at multiple effect levels (IC10-IC90). Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of these combinations was assessed in tumor samples of 50 primary breast cancer patients, utilizing the ATP-tumorchemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA). Drug interactions were shown to be strongly dose-related in the human breast cancer cell lines investigated. At clinically relevant concentrations, CBDCA/PTX demonstrated synergistic (MCF-7) or additive (MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3) interactions, and EPI/PTX showed additive (SK-BR-3, MCF-7) and antagonistic (MDA-MB-231) interactions. GEM/PTX and VIN/PTX, however, demonstrated antagonism over multiple dose effect levels at clinically relevant drug concentrations in all three cell lines tested. At plasma peak concentrations, EPI/PTX, CBDCA/PTX, GEM/PTX and VIN/PTX achieved &gt; or = 90% tumor growth inhibition in 93, 86, 63 and 50%, respectively, of primary breast cancer samples investigated with the ATP-TCA. Cumulative dose-response plots of primary breast cancer tumor cells responding in vitro with &gt; or = 90% growth inhibition showed a strong dose dependence for both EPI/PTX and CBDCA/PTX. In conclusion, the current data indicate favorable drug interactions for CBDCA/PTX at clinically relevant drug concentrations in breast cancer cells, and demonstrate superior in vitro cytotoxicity of EPI/PTX and CBDCA/PTX compared to GEM/PTX and VIN/PTX in primary breast cancer cultures.",M2
11320663,"A phase II study of dose-intense ifosfamide plus epirubicin with hematopoietic growth factors for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas; a novel sequential schedule.PURPOSE: The efficacy and feasibility of a novel sequential schedule of high-dose ifosfamide (HD-IFO) and full-dose epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was evaluated in adult patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). METHODS: Since November 1995, 22 chemotherapy-naive patients have been treated. HD-IFO was given as a continuous infusion at a total dose of 14-18 g/m2 per cycle, with mesna, over 6 to 8 days, q 3 weeks, twice. EPI was administered subsequently as an i.v. bolus at a total dose of 120-160 mg/m2, on days 1-2, q 2 weeks, twice. G-CSF was planned for each course of treatment as a daily subcutaneous injection for 7 days, starting 24 h after the end of the treatment. After the first four cycles, patients were evaluated for surgery and patients with locally inoperable or metastatic disease received further chemotherapy up to a maximum of eight cycles. RESULTS: The response of 19 patients could be assessed. One complete response (CR) and six partial responses (PRs) were achieved for an overall response rate of 37% (95% confidence interval, 15-59%). Noteworthy is that two of the six leiomyosarcoma patients responded to the HD-IFO treatment. The median survival period was 15 months. Most common toxicities included myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, and stomatitis. Six patients were hospitalized for complicated nadir fever. No severe renal and CNS toxicities were seen. Transient gross hematuria occurred in six patients and affected treatment in only one case. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: By the protraction of continuous infusion of HD-IFO over 6 to 8 days, ifosfamide-induced acute renal toxicity is avoided, while G-CSF support allows the delivery of the planned dose intensity in most of the patients. Although manageable in an oncology setting, the hematologic toxicity of such a regimen remains substantial. Moreover, in terms of efficacy and median survival, this regimen showed no benefits over a conventional-dose anthracycline-ifosfamide schema. Further evaluations of this novel ifosfamide-epirubicin schedule are not warranted, even if the HD-IFO regimen could be taken forward specifically for leiomyosarcomas in a phase II trial.",M2
11304775,"Clinical and pharmacologic study of the epirubicin and paclitaxel combination in women with metastatic breast cancer.PURPOSE: A pharmacokinetic interaction may cause increased cardiotoxicity of paclitaxel (PTX) and high cumulative dose of doxorubicin. We tested antitumor activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the lesser cardiotoxic epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and PTX (ET combination). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven women with untreated metastatic breast cancer, median age of 56 years, and prominent visceral involvement (74%) were studied. Three-weekly EPI (90 mg/m(2)) and PTX (200 mg/m(2) over 3 hours) were given for a maximum nine cycles. EPI was administered 24 hours before PTX (E --&gt; T) in cycle 1, and 15 minutes before PTX (ET) thereafter. EPI, epirubicinol (EOL), EPI-glucuronide (EPI-glu), EOL-glucuronide (EOL-glu), PTX, and 6alpha-OH-PTX were measured in plasma and urine in 14 women. RESULTS: Patients received 205 cycles of ET and a median EPI dose of 720 mg/m(2). Grade 4 neutropenia (49% of cycles) was the most frequent toxicity. Cardiac contractility was decreased in five patients. Mild congestive heart failure occurred in two (7.4%). Response rate was 76% (28% complete). Median overall survival was 29 months. On the basis of intrapatient comparison in the first 24 hours of E --&gt; T and ET cycles, PTX did not affect EPI disposition, but significantly increased plasma exposure to EOL (by 137%), EPI-glu (threefold) and EOL-glu (twofold). Urinary excretion of EPI dose went from 8.2% in E --&gt; T to 11.8% in ET cycles. Clearance of PTX was 30% slower in ET than E --&gt; T. ET cycles caused lower neutrophil nadir than E --&gt; T (644 +/- 327 v 195 +/- 91, P &lt;.05) CONCLUSION: ET is feasible, devoid of excessive cardiac toxicity, and active. A reciprocal pharmacokinetic interference between the two drugs has pharmacodynamic consequences, and suggests a direct effect of PTX on EPI metabolism requiring ad hoc investigation.",M2
11296618,"Dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin and paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity and toxicity profile of dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin (<e>EPI</e>) and paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer (ABC). From January to September 1997, 41 patients with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer were enrolled in the study. Their median age was 57 (range, 33-77) years and median performance status 0 (range, 0-2). Twenty patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of 4 cycles of EPI 110 mg/m2 every 2 weeks followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel, 225 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 2 weeks. G-CSF was administered prophylactically on days 2-10 of each cycle. 34 (83.0%) patients completed all 8 cycles of chemotherapy. A total of 304 cycles were administered, 259 (85.0%) of them at full dose. Thirty (10.0%) cycles were delivered with a delay. The relative median dose intensities of EPI and paclitaxel were 0.95. Most common grade 3-4 side effects were anemia (15.0%) neutropenia (12.0%), thrombocytopenia (5.0%), nausea/vomiting (10.0%), febrile neutropenia (7.5%), and alopecia (90.0%). Overall, 8 (19.5%) patients achieved a complete and 15 (36.5%) a partial response. Median duration of response was 8.4 (range, 3.1-15.5+) months. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, median time to progression was 8.7 (range, 0.5-21+) months; median survival has not been reached yet. Dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with EPI and paclitaxel shows promising activity as first-line treatment in ABC.

Clinical benefit and response rate were the main efficacy end-points. From December 1997 to October 1999, 30 consecutive patients with measurable advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled. Gemcitabine was administered intravenously in 30 min at a dose of 800 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 followed by i.v. injection of epirubicin 25 mg/m(2); treatment was repeated every 28 days. With regard to clinical benefit response, 8/21 patients (38%) experienced significant palliation of tumor-related symptoms; the median symptom control time was 25 weeks. No complete responses were recorded while 6 patients achieved a partial remission, for an overall response rate of 20%; 10 patients (30%) had a stable disease and 14 (46%) had progressive disease. The median time to progression was 14 weeks. Median survival was 26 weeks, with 6 patients (20%) having long-term survival at 46 weeks. In general, chemotherapy was well tolerated; 9 patients (30%) suffered from WHO grade 3-4 haematological toxicity and 5 patients (16.6%) suffered from grade 3 non-haematological toxicity. In conclusion, the GEM plus EPI regimen represent a feasible approach for improvement of clinical benefit in advanced pancreatic cancer patients, but confirmatory investigations are required.",M2
11346706,"Kinetics of PBPC mobilization by cyclophosphamide, as compared with that by epirubicin/paclitaxel followed by G-CSF support: implications for optimal timing of PBPC harvest.BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the mobilization kinetics of autologous PBPCs after induction with various chemotherapy regimens. With PBPC mobilization in patients with breast cancer used as a model for chemotherapy-induced PBPC recruitment, the kinetics of progenitor cells mobilized either with cyclophosphamide (CY) or epirubicin/paclitaxel (<e>EPI</e>-TAX) followed by the administration of G-CSF was compared. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included a total of 86 patients with breast cancer (stage II-IV) receiving either CY (n = 39) or EPI-TAX (n = 47), both followed by G-CSF support. The progenitor cell content in peripheral blood and apheresis components was monitored by flow cytometric enumeration of CD34+ cells. PBPC collection was started when the threshold of &gt;20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per L of peripheral blood was reached. RESULTS: The PBPC collection was begun a median of 9 days after the administration of EPI-TAX followed by G-CSF support, as compared to a median of 13 days after mobilization with CY plus G-CSF. After treatment with CY, the total numbers of PBPCs peaked on Day 1 of apheresis, and they rapidly declined thereafter. In contrast, treatment with EPI-TAX followed by G-CSF administration led to a steady mobilization of CD34+ cells during leukapheresis. The difference in the mobilization patterns with CY and EPI-TAX resulted in a greater yield of CD34+ cells per L of processed blood volume. Compared to EPI-TAX, mobilization with CY required the overall processing of 30 percent less whole-blood volume to reach the target yield of &gt; or = 10 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg of body weight. After a median of three apheresis procedures, however, both CY+G-CSF and EPI-TAX+G-CSF were equally effective in obtaining this target yield. CONCLUSION: These results imply that specific PBPC mobilization as part of a given chemotherapy regimen should be taken into consideration before the planning of a PBPC harvest.",M2
