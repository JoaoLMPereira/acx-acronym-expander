19793355,"Accuracy of spirometry in diagnosing pulmonary restriction in elderly people.OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy of a diagnosis of pulmonary restriction made using forced vital capacity (FVC) less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) with the criterion standard diagnosis made using total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) less than the LLN in an elderly population. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred sixty-four ambulatory and acute care hospital patients aged 65 to 96 underwent complete pulmonary function evaluation. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of diagnosis of pulmonary restriction defined as FVC less than the LLN were calculated in the overall sample and after stratification according to bronchial obstruction. Expected PPV and NPV at different background prevalence of true pulmonary restriction (5% and 15%) were calculated using the Bayes theorem. RESULTS: Low sensitivity (0.32) and high specificity (0.95) were found, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89. In participants without bronchial obstruction, specificity was even higher, although sensitivity decreased to 0.28 (AUC=0.92). The PPV was good (0.81), whereas with a low to moderate a priori probability (prevalence from 5% to 15%) the NPV was fair (&gt; or =0.89). CONCLUSION: A reduction in FVC below LLN cannot reliably identify true pulmonary restriction in elderly people, confirming previous findings in the adult population. Normal FVC, instead, can effectively exclude pulmonary restriction regardless of the presence of bronchial obstruction when the a priori probability is low or moderately high.",M1
19664729,"Marked pericardial inhomogeneity of specific ventilation at total lung capacity and beyond.We measured regional ventilation at 1l above functional residual capacity (FRC+1L) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) in three normal subjects and four elite breath-hold divers, and above TLC after glossopharyngeal insufflation (TLC+GI) in the divers. Hyperpolarized (3)He MRI was used to map the local ventilation per unit volume over the entire lung. At TLC and above, there was markedly increased regional ventilation of the lungs in the pericardial region compared with the relatively uniform ventilation throughout the rest of the lung. The distribution of fractional ventilation regionally was relatively uniform at FRC+1L, with a small non-gravitational cephalocaudal gradient of specific ventilation in the supine posture. Our observations at high lung volumes are consistent with the effect of high pleural tension in the concave pericardial region, which promotes expansion of the subjacent lung, leading to a higher local effective compliance and a higher specific ventilation.",M1
19664351,"Airway function and respiratory resistance in Taiwanese coal workers with simple pneumoconiosis.BACKGROUND: Occupational exposure to coalmine dust consisting of coal particles and free silica eventually results in massive lung fibrosis. However, clinical observations of patients with coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) suggest that airway dysfunction may be a predominant feature in the initial development of the disease. METHODS: Forced expirogram, plethysmographic determination of lung volumes, and measurement of respiratory resistance (Rrs) by the forced oscillation technique at 3, 9, and 18 Hz were conducted in a sample of 71 coal miners with simple pneumoconiosis and 36 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The forced vital capacity (FVC) was well-preserved even in miners with category 2 and 3 CWP. There were no differences in the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values between healthy subjects and miners with category 1 disease. However, the level of airflow limitation in these miners increased with the transition from category 1 to category 2 and 3. The FEV1/FVC ratio fell below 70% in miners with category 2 and 3 disease, in both smokers and non-smokers. A consistent increase in the ratio of the residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/<e>TLC</e>) in the miners compared with that of the control workers was found. An abnormally high Rrs at 3 Hz (Rrs3) and frequency dependence in the flow resistance were also demonstrated in these subjects. There was an upward trend in the values of Rrs3 in the higher radiological categories. The correlation between respiratory conductance at this frequency (Grs3) and the RV/TLC ratio was good (r = - 0.763, p&lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Simple CWP is not associated with a clinically apparent reduction in lung volume. The Rrs3 appears to be a sensitive parameter for detecting airway obstruction in patients with simple CWP associated or not with a reduced FEV1.",M1
19639626,"FRC measurements using body plethysmography in young children.BACKGROUND: Measurement of FRC in whole body plethysmography (FRCpleth) is not performed in young children (aged 3-5 years) because it involves sitting alone in a closed box and breathing attempts against occlusion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of measuring FRCpleth in young children. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-one of 102 children (age range 3.3-6.9 years) performed spirometry and FRCpleth measurements. Twenty-six children had controlled asthma (Group-A); 26 children were tested during asthma exacerbation had uncontrolled asthma (Group-UA), and 19 children were tested after receiving chemotherapy treatment (Group-C). Tests according to adult recommendations were first taught outside the plethysmograph and then performed with minor technical adaptations. Each test included two consecutive FRC measurements obtained during 2-3 sec of occlusion. Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and residual volume (RV) were calculated. Values were compared to FRC measured by Helium-dilution (FRC-He) in healthy preschool children and to extrapolated FRCpleth values of school children, and between the groups. RESULTS: Group-A showed normal spirometry and normal TLC values, with mildly elevated FRCpleth and RV values (125 +/- 20 and 153 +/- 33 %predicted, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for both values). Group-UA showed obstructed flows combined with high FRCpleth and RV (146 +/- 26 and 189 +/- 38 %predicted; P &lt; 0.0001) and normal TLC. Group-C showed a restrictive spirometry pattern combined with lower than normal TLC (86 +/- 15 %predicted; P &lt; 0.0251). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring absolute lung volumes by plethysmography in young children is feasible and can detect abnormal lung volumes. It is essential to study a larger group of healthy children for reference values and to allow for standardization of the procedure.",M1
19630079,"Quantitative MRI measurement of lung density must account for the change in T(2) (*) with lung inflation.PURPOSE: To evaluate lung water density at three different levels of lung inflation in normal lungs using a fast gradient echo sequence developed for rapid imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were imaged with a fast gradient echo sequence that collects 12 images alternating between two closely spaced echoes in a single 9-s breathhold. Data were fit to a single exponential to determine lung water density and T(2) (*). Data were evaluated in a single imaging slice at total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV). Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to statistically evaluate changes in T(2) (*) and lung water density across lung volumes, imaging plane, and spatial locations in the lung. RESULTS: In normal subjects (n = 10), T(2) (*) (and [lung density/water density]) was 1.2 +/- 0.1 msec (0.10 +/- 0.02), 1.8 +/- 0.2 ms (0.25 +/- 0.04), and 2.0 +/- 0.2 msec (0.27 +/- 0.03) at TLC, FRC, and RV, respectively. Results also show that there is a considerable intersubject variability in the values of T(2) (*). CONCLUSION: Data show that T(2) (*) in the lung is very short, and varies considerably with lung volume. Thus, if quantitative assessment of lung density within a breathhold is to be measured accurately, then it is necessary to also determine T(2) (*).",M1
19481169,"A pilot comparison of helium dilution and plethysmographic lung volumes to assess the impact of a long-acting bronchodilator on lung hyperinflation in COPD.BACKGROUND: Currently, two methods for measuring <e>TLC</e>, RV, and FRC are used in clinical pulmonary function laboratories: body plethysmography and helium dilution. However, these methods are not interchangeable. In moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction, dilution method tends to underestimate and body plethysmography tends to overestimate RV. PURPOSE: In 21 patients suffering from COPD (basal FEV(1): 56.69+/-13.64), we investigated whether the two methods of measuring FRC and RV could respond differently to a 2-week treatment with tiotropium 18 microg/day. MAIN RESULTS: Tiotropium induced a significant increase in FEV(1) and FVC but not in IC. At baseline, FRC(pleth), RV(pleth) and TLC(pleth) were higher than FRC(He), RV(He) and TLC(He). At the end of the study FRC(pleth), RV(pleth) and TLC(pleth) decreased and FRC(He), RV(He) and TLC(He) increased but only changes in FRC(pleth) and RV(pleth) were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The use of body plethysmography seems to be more appropriate in clinical trials aimed at assessing the impact of a therapeutic procedure in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation.",M1
19476603,"Electrical impedance tomography is able to track changes in respiratory function in endotoxin-challenged rodents.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In order to assess and optimize the effect of new therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) in rodent models, a monitoring technique that continuously assesses the functional state of the lung is mandatory. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been suggested as a technique for quantifying lung inflammation in ALI. However, EIT has not been evaluated in a rodent model of ALI. METHODS: EIT measurements were compared in ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 14), randomly subjected to intratracheal administration of endotoxin (LPS) or saline (control). Lung mechanics, lung weight wet/dry ratio and inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also evaluated. RESULTS: LPS caused a significant decrease in lung compliance and <e>TLC</e> as compared with control (-42.0%, P = 0.04, and -27.9%, P = 0.02, respectively). These changes were paralleled by differences in mean impedance changes as detected by EIT (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: rho = 0.66 and 0.73, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). LPS increased the lung weight wet/dry ratio (6.35 +/- 0.42 vs 5.15 +/- 0.07, P = 0.003), and the bronchoalveolar lavage total WCC (8.96 +/- 1.87 vs 1.16 +/- 0.10 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.002) as compared with control. The lung weight wet/dry ratio was inversely related to the mean impedance change (rho = -0.76, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated for the first time that eight-electrode EIT readily tracks the inflammatory response of lung tissue in a rodent model of ALI. EIT may thus provide a promising, non-invasive technique for monitoring the time-course of ALI in rodent models, and for testing novel pharmacological strategies to counter it.",M1
19419494,"Plethysmographic lung volumes in children with sighing dyspnea.BACKGROUND: This study compared the plethysmographic lung volumes of children with sighing dyspnea with healthy children and tested the hypothesis that sighing children suffer from hyperinflation or gas trapping as a cause of dyspnea. METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2006, pediatric patients with sighing dyspnea presenting to the pulmonary clinic of a tertiary children's hospital who had no apparent cardiopulmonary diseases were prospectively enrolled; normal healthy children were invited to participate for comparison. Baseline pre-bronchodilator spirometry and post-inhaled bronchodilator spirometry were measured for the determination of bronchodilator response. Plethysmographic lung volumes were determined solely for total lung capacity, residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC) without the use of inhaled bronchodilator according to standard procedure. RESULTS: Eighteen sighing children (10 boys) and 10 healthy subjects (six boys) were included in the present study. They had a median age of 13 years (range, 8-15 years) and 13 years (range, 8-17 years), respectively. The mean baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) of subjects with dyspnea was 79.4 +/- 16.7% of predicted, while that of the normal control children was 88.4 +/- 6.7%, which was not statistically significantly different. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/FVC % of predicted were within normal limits and indicated no bronchodilator response. RV and RV/total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were elevated in children with sighing dyspnea that were not measured by spirometry, but TLC and FRC measured on plethysmography (FRC(pleth)) were not increased. CONCLUSIONS: RV and RV/TLC were higher in children with sighing dyspnea that were not measured by spirometry, but TLC and FRC(pleth) were not increased. The causal link between dysfunctional breathing patterns and changes in static lung volumes was not able to be determined in the present study. The possibility of heterogeneity of patients with sighing dyspnea obscures the significance of lung volume discrepancy in this population; further subdivision of children with sighing dyspnea in a larger cohort of patients is required.",M1
19398372,"The influence of air pollution during intrauterine development and early childhood on respiratory functions at later age.AIM: The aim of this study is to estimate the influence of high levels of air pollution during intrauterine development and early childhood on the respiratory functions at a later stage in life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects were children from Dimitrovgrad - one of the most industrialized areas in Bulgaria. The transition to market economy (after 1989) was accompanied by a great drop in industrial production and levels of air pollutants respectively. A complete functional respiratory test of 122 clinically healthy ten-year-old children (48 boys and 74 girls) from Dimitrovgrad was carried out (MasterScreen Diffusion, Jaeger, Wuerzburg, Germany). The participants were distributed in 3 groups: First group (I), n=60 - born and lived to their fifth year of age under conditions of heavy air pollution, and whose mothers had their pregnancies in the same environment; Second group (II), n=39 - born and lived after the abrupt production drop, under considerably lower level of pollution, but whose mothers had their pregnancies prior to that; Third group (III), n=23 - born after the abrupt production drop, lived in conditions of considerably lower level of pollution, and whose mothers had their pregnancies in this more favorable environment. RESULTS: The lowest functional indicators of external breathing in the children from the first group were found. FEV(1%pred) - 100.41+/-12.05 (I), 107.38+/-12.55 (II), 111.56+/-11.08 (III), P(IvsII)=0.017, P(IvsIII)=0.001, P(IIvsIII)=0.57; <e>TLC</e>(%pred) - 89.85+/-8.54 (I), 102.76+/-11.57 (II), 102.83+/-11.47 (III), P(IvsII)&lt;0.0001, P(IvsIII)&lt;0.0001, P(IIvsIII)=1. CONCLUSION: The research makes an attempt to provide evidence for the negative influence of high levels of air pollution during the intrauterine development and during early childhood, manifested by respiratory limitations at a later stage of childhood. It is known that the influence of air pollution with TSPM and SO(2) during the first 5 years of life is more important than that in intrauterine development for the respiratory functions. Data is lacking with concern to intrauterine programing of respiratory function. Further research is necessary for a detailed elucidation of the problem.",M1
19394744,"[Relation between atherosclerotic calcifications detected in chest computed tomography and lung function]BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A few recent epidemiological findings indicate a link between atherosclerosis and some lung functions. We studied further the relation between calcified chest atherosclerosis as seen in computed tomography (CT) and several lung functional parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Male construction workers originally screened for occupational lung cancer with CT had their chest atherosclerosis (aorta, the origins of its cervical branches, the coronary arteries and heart valves) visually classified. The relation between the atherosclerotic calcification scores and lung function (total lung capacity [<e>TLC</e>], forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1%], forced vital capacity [FVC%], maximal expiratory flow when 50% of FVC remains to be exhaled, total and specific diffusing capacities; all above expressed as percent of predicted value, and the FEV1/FVC% ratio) were studied with the general linear model adjusted for smoking, exposure years for asbestos, and body mass index (n=432). RESULTS: All lung functions except TLC showed significant negative associations with calcifications in aorta and in its branches. TLC showed such association only with atherosclerosis in the ascending aorta. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic atherosclerosis seems to be related with poor lung function. This may be due to deteriorated bronchial circulation, but other mechanisms can also be involved. Lung function poorer than would be expected due to pulmonary reasons may indicate aortic atherosclerosis.",M1
19266260,"HRCT and scleroderma: semiquantitative evaluation of lung damage and functional abnormalities.PURPOSE: This study sought to validate the Warrick score in the assessment of lung involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and correlate the results with functional abnormalities. In addition, we propose the use of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) indices of alveolitis and fibrosis to discriminate between different stages of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with SSc (16 with the diffuse form and 15 with the limited form) underwent functional and HRCT evaluations of the lung. The semiquantitative evaluation of radiological involvement, as proposed by Warrick, provides a score for each lesion based on the severity and the extent of the pulmonary damage. In addition to the total score, indices for alveolitis and fibrosis were created. The association between each score and functional abnormalities was tested. RESULTS: The total Warrick score was 16+/-7.7 [mean+/-standard deviation (SD)]. The total score correlated inversely with total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) (percentage of predicted TLC) (r=-0.38; p=0.04), diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (percentage of predicted DLCO) (r=-0.43; p=0.02) and with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (percentage of predicted FEV1) (r=-0.36; p=0.05). The alveolitis and fibrosis indices were 1.9+/-1.1 and 14.2+/-7.4, respectively. The alveolitis index correlated significantly with percentage of predicted DLCO (r=-0.46; p=0.01) but not with percentage of predicted TLC (r=-0.28; p=0.13). The fibrosis index correlated both with percentage of predicted DLCO (r=-0.38; p=0.04) and with percentage of predicted TLC (r=-0.35; p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the diagnostic role of HRCT in assessing the extent of lung damage in SSc. Furthermore, the two indices (alveolitis and fibrosis) provide new tools for evaluating the relationship between pulmonary involvement and systemic impairment in SSc.",M1
19129282,"Characterisation of severe obliterative bronchiolitis in rheumatoid arthritis.The characteristics of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who develop obliterative bronchiolitis characterised by severe airflow obstruction have been hitherto poorly investigated. A retrospective study of 25 patients with RA and functional evidence of obliterative bronchiolitis (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;50% and/or residual volume (RV)/total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) &gt;140% predicted) was conducted. Patients (mean+/-SD age 64+/-11 yrs) included 17 never-smokers and eight ex-smokers (10.5+/-5.4 pack-yrs). The diagnosis of RA preceded respiratory symptoms in 88% of cases. Dyspnoea on exertion was present in all patients and bronchorrhea in 44%. High-resolution computed tomography findings included: bronchial wall thickening (96%), bronchiectasis (40%), mosaic pattern (40%), centrilobular emphysema (56%), and reticular and/or ground-glass opacities (32%). Pulmonary function tests showed: FEV(1) 41+/-12% pred, FEV(1)/FVC 49+/-14%, FVC 70+/-20% pred, RV 148+/-68% pred and RV/TLC 142+/-34% pred. Lung biopsy, available in nine patients, demonstrated constrictive, follicular and mixed bronchiolitis. Patients were followed for 48.2+/-49 months. Treatment was poorly effective. Chronic respiratory failure occurred in 40% of patients, and four patients died. Obliterative bronchiolitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis is a severe and under-recognised condition leading to respiratory failure and death in a high proportion of patients.",M1
19011195,"The effect of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis on the reliability of CT signs of pulmonary hypertension.PURPOSE: To determine whether pulmonary artery (PA) dilatation is a reliable indicator of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had institutional review board approval. Patient consent was not required. Seventy-seven patients (39 men, 38 women) who underwent right heart catheterization were studied. The study population was divided into 30 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (group A), and 47 without (group B). The main PA diameter (dPA) and ascending aorta diameter (dAA) were measured by using computed tomography (CT), and the extent of fibrosis was recorded in group A. The dPA and the dPA/dAA ratio were correlated (Spearman rank) with mean PA pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi). The relationship between dPA and pulmonary fibrosis extent and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) was examined by using multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: There were strong correlations between dPA and both mPAP (r = 0.67, P &lt; .0001) and PVRi (r = 0.78, P &lt; .0001) in group B. In contrast, there were no significant correlations in group A (r = 0.23, P = .22 for mPAP and r = 0.23, P = .28 for PVRi). The dPA/dAA ratio had similar relationships to dPA alone in group B (r = 0.72, P &lt; .0001 for mPAP and r = 0.71, P &lt; .0001 for PVRi), but significantly strengthened the correlations in group A (r = 0.54, P &lt; .005 for mPAP and r = 0.48, P = .04 for PVRi). PA dilatation occurred in group A in the absence of significant PH, and was unrelated to CT fibrosis score or TLC. CONCLUSION: PA dilatation occurs in the absence of PH in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and is therefore an unreliable sign of PH in these patients.",M1
19002147,"Glossopharyngeal pistoning for lung insufflation in patients with cervical spinal cord injury.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES:To evaluate whether patients with cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) are able to learn the technique of glossopharyngeal pistoning (breathing) for lung insufflation (GI) and if learned, to evaluate the effects of GI on pulmonary function and chest expansion after 8 weeks. SETTING: Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with CSCI (21 men, four women) with a mean age of 46 years (21-70), from the Stockholm area, were used in this study. The participants performed 10 cycles of GI four times a week, for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function tests made before and after the GI training included vital capacity (VC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), functional residual capacity (FRC; measured with nitrogen washout), residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). Chest expansion was measured before and after training. RESULTS: Five of the twenty-five participants had difficulty in performing GI and were excluded in further analysis. Performing a GI maneuvre increased participants' VC on average by 0.88+/-0.5 l. After 8 weeks of training, the participants had significantly increased their VC 0.23 l, (P&lt;0.001), ERV 0.16 l, (P&lt;0.01), FRC 0.86 l, (P&lt;0.001), RV 0.70 l, (P&lt;0.001) and TLC 0.93 l, (P&lt;0.001). Chest expansion increased at the level of the xiphoid process by 1.2 cm (P&lt;0.001) and at the level of the fourth costae by 0.7 cm (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After using GI for a period of 8 weeks, the participants with CSCI who could perform GI were able to improve pulmonary function and chest expansion.",M1
18798848,"Association of findings in flow-volume spirometry with high-resolution computed tomography signs in asbestos-exposed male workers.INTRODUCTION: Disorders of pulmonary tissue and pleura are visualized by findings in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and the impairment caused by these findings is assessed by pulmonary function tests. Our aim was to determine how some commonly used spirometric variables are related to certain HRCT signs, in order to find out which HRCT signs are associated with restrictive and which with obstructive ventilatory impairment. METHODS: Altogether 590 asbestos-exposed workers, 95% of whom were smokers or ex-smokers, were studied with HRCT; 19 pathological signs were scored. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow at 50% of FVC (MEF50) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were measured, and their relationship with HRCT signs was examined with bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: FVC and TLC were negatively correlated with fibrosis score, parenchymal bands, extent of pleural thickenings and positively with widened retrosternal space. FEV1/FVC ratio was negatively correlated with emphysema types and widened retrosternal space and positively with parenchymal bands and subpleural nodules. Thickened bronchial walls did not separate between restrictive and obstructive ventilatory function. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT signs showed distinctive patterns in restrictive and obstructive ventilatory impairment. These results can be used to help to analyse the lung function of patients simultaneously exposed to asbestos and smoking, when this relationship requires elucidation. In addition, the results may be helpful in explaining some radiological findings.",M1
18760576,"Impulse oscillometry in COPD: identification of measurements related to airway obstruction, airway conductance and lung volumes.BACKGROUND: Impulse oscillometry system (IOS) assesses pulmonary resistance and reactance. We set out to investigate which IOS measurements are related to airflow obstruction, airway conductance and lung volumes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Ninety-four COPD patients were recruited and 58 agreed to follow up after 1 year. IOS measurements (R5, R20, X5 &amp; Fres), body plethysmography (sGaw, FRC, <e>TLC</e>, RV &amp; IC) and spirometry (FEV(1)) were performed. Pearson or Spearman correlation determined the relationships between IOS and other measurements. RESULTS: R5, X5 and Fres were all significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with FEV(1), sGaw, TLC, RV and IC. However, R20 was not related to any of these measurements except for RV. The strongest associations were observed between FEV(1) and the reactance measurements X5 (r=0.48) and Fres (r=-0.44), and sGaw with X5 (r=0.47) and Fres (r=0.51). The r values for the associations with TLC and IC were all &lt;0.25. There was no statistically significant change in the FEV(1), R5, X5 or Fres after 1 year, but R20 significantly increased over the year. The changes in R5 and R20 did not significantly correlate with the changes in FEV(1). In contrast, X5 changes were significantly related to FEV(1) changes over 1 year (r=-0.27, p=0.05), while for Fres changes there was a trend to statistical significance (p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: IOS reactance measurements are more closely related than resistance measurements to other pulmonary function measurements in COPD patients. The IOS reactance measurements appear to be indicative of changes in pulmonary compliance caused by airflow obstruction.",M1
18689595,"Clinical predictors and histologic appearance of acute exacerbations in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations (AEs) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are critical factors for its clinical course and prognosis. We have seen AEs and poor prognosis consequent to AE in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), as has been seen in patients with IPF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of the patients with AE in those with chronic HP. METHODS: We reviewed 100 consecutive patients with chronic bird fancier lung (BFL) from 1993 to 2006, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, including history, and laboratory and immunologic, imaging, BAL, and histologic findings. RESULTS: AE developed in 14 patients during this observation period (AE group), whereas 86 patients remained stable (non-AE [NAE] group). The 2-year frequency of AE among patients with chronic BFL having usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like lesions seen on surgical lung specimens was 11.5%. Patients with AE were more likely to be smokers (p = 0.003). In pulmonary function test results, the mean total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) were lower in patients with AEs (TLC: AE patients, 63.0 +/- 16.8%; NAE patients, 81.6 +/- 20.0%; Dlco: AE patients, 41.9 +/- 19.0%; NAE patients, 60.0 +/- 19.4%). The mean number of lymphocytes in BAL fluid were lower (AE patients, 13.7 +/- 7.5 lymphocytes; NAE patients, 37.2 +/- 29.7 lymphocytes), while the number of neutrophils were greater in AE patients (AE patients, 10.7 +/- 17.6 neutrophils; NAE patients, 3.6 +/- 4.4 neutrophils). Histologic and/or radiologic findings revealed that all AE patients had UIP-like lesions. Diffuse alveolar damage was observed in six cases, whereas organizing pneumonia superimposed on preexistent fibrotic lesions was observed in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed several predictive factors for AE at the time of diagnosis. Low TLC and Dlco, low lymphocyte levels in BAL fluid, and a UIP-like pattern in histology at the time of diagnosis may be the risk factors for AE.",M1
18674986,"Determinants of lung volumes in chronic spinal cord injury.OBJECTIVE: To characterize determinants of lung volumes in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: VA Boston Healthcare System. PARTICIPANTS: White men (N=330) with chronic SCI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire responses and measurements of lung volumes. RESULTS: Adjusted for SCI severity and stature, greater body mass index (BMI) was associated (all P&lt;.05) with lower total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) (-38.7 mL x kg(-1) x m(-2)), functional residual capacity (FRC) (-73.9 mL x kg(-1) x m(-2)), residual volume (RV) (-40.4 mL x kg(-1) x m(-2)), and expiratory reserve volume (ERV) (-32.2 mL x kg(-1) x m(-2)). The effect of BMI on RV was most pronounced in quadriplegia (-72 mL x kg(-1) x m(-2)). Lifetime smoking was associated with a greater FRC (5.3 mL/pack-year) and RV (3.1 mL/pack-years). The effects of lifetime smoking were also greatest in quadriplegia (11 mL/pack-year for FRC; 7.8 mL/pack-year for RV). Time since injury, independent of age, was associated with a decrease in TLC, FRC, ERV, and RV (P&lt;.05). Age was not a predictor of TLC once time since injury was considered. CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of FRC, TLC, ERV, and RV in chronic SCI include factors related and unrelated to SCI. The mechanisms remain to be determined but likely involve the elastic properties and muscle function of the respiratory system and perhaps the effects of systemic inflammation related to adiposity. Addressing modifiable factors such as obesity, muscle stiffness, and smoking may improve respiratory morbidity and mortality in SCI by improving pulmonary function.",M1
18488442,"Impact of laughter on air trapping in severe chronic obstructive lung disease.Static and dynamic hyperinflation is an important factor of exertional dyspnea in patients with severe COPD. This proof-of-concept intervention trial sought to study whether laughter can reduce hyperinflation through repetitive expiratory efforts in patients with severe COPD. For small groups of patients with severe COPD (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 10) Pello the clown performed a humor intervention triggering regular laughter. Plethysmography was done before and up to 24 hours after intervention. Laughing and smiling were quantified with video-analysis. Real-time breathing pattern was assessed with the LifeShirt, and the psychological impact of the intervention was monitored with self-administered questionnaires. The intervention led to a reduction of <e>TLC</e> in COPD (p = 0.04), but not in controls (p = 0.9). TLC reduction was due to a decline of the residual volume. Four (22 [CI 95% 7 to 46] %) patients were &gt; or = 10% responders. The frequency of smiling and TLC at baseline were independent predictors of TLC response. The humor intervention improved cheerfulness, but not seriousness nor bad mood. In conclusion, smiling induced by a humor intervention was able to reduce hyperinflation in patients with severe COPD. A smiling-derived breathing technique might complement pursed-lips breathing in patients with symptomatic obstruction.",M1
18481230,"Bronchodilator response in residual volume in irreversible airway obstruction.BACKGROUND: Although airway obstruction, as defined by improvement of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and/or forced vital capacity (FVC), is irreversible in patients with COPD, they clearly seem to benefit from treatment with inhaled bronchodilators. AIMS: To assess the response pattern of residual volume (RV) compared to FEV1 after bronchodilation in patients with reversible and irreversible airway obstruction. METHODS: Changes in static lung volumes were compared with improvement in dynamic lung volumes in 396 consecutive patients undergoing reversibility testing with repeat bodyplethysmography. Reversibility was defined as improvement of FEV1 &gt;200 ml and &gt;12% after inhalation of fenoterol hydrobromide. RESULTS: Irreversibility was found in 297 out of 396 patients with airway obstruction. Except for total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), all parameters (residual volume [RV], vital capacity [VC], forced inspiratory vital capacity [IVC], forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and the FEV1/VC ratio) showed statistically significant changes after bronchodilation in 396 patients. The multiple linear regression model adjusted for age, sex and BMI showed a non-linear relationship between DeltaFEV1 or DeltaVC compared to DeltaRV after bronchodilation. If the increase in DeltaFEV1 is lower than 0.1 L, DeltaRV remains constant. However, if the increase in DeltaFEV1 is more than 0.1 L, DeltaRV decreases too. The same is found at an increase in VC of 0.3 L. CONCLUSION: In summary, in patients with irreversible airway obstruction DeltaRV cannot be predicted by DeltaFEV1 or DeltaVC after bronchodilation. Therefore, spirometric assessment should be complemented by bodyplethysmography.",M1
18441687,"[Gas exchange function of the lungs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus]AIM: To investigate diffuse capacity and static pulmonary volumes in type 1 diabetics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated 141 young (66 females) patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (mean age 26.2, 6.2 years, mean duration of endocrinopathy 12.6, 7.3 years) in comparison to 36 age-, sex-, weight- and height-matched healthy controls (C). The diabetic patients were divided into 4 groups: 1) 46 diabetic patients without microvascular complications (DP1), 2) 48 diabetic patients with debut late complication (DP2), 3) 34 diabetic patients with severe late complications (DP3), 4) 13 diabetic patients with end-stage renal failure (nephropathy stage 5) who were not yet on dialysis (DP4). Spirometry measurements before and after bronchodilator administration were performed, TL(CO) was measured in sitting position by the single-breath (TL(COsb)) and steady-state (TL(COss) methods, TL(COsb) corrected by alveolar volume (KCO = TL(COsb)/VA), single breath helium dilution lung volumes were done. RESULTS: There was no difference in gas exchange and lung volumes between DP1 and C. We found a significant reduction of TL(COsb), TL(COss), KCO parameters as compared with controls in diabetic patients with initial late complications (DP2). Severe diabetic microangiopath (DP3, DP4) associated with significantly decreased TL(CO) and reduction total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). Typical features of restrictive pulmonary defects, namely a reduction of TLC and TL(CO) were observed predominantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy of stage IV-V. There was no evidence of air flow limitation in any of diabetics studied. CONCLUSION: Diabetic process caused decreased pulmonary gas exchange and reduction of lung volumes. These gasometric and spirometric changes indicated some coexistence with late diabetic complications.",M1
18398589,"Characteristics of the respiratory mechanical and muscle function of competitive breath-hold divers.Competitive breath-hold divers (BHD) employ glossopharyngeal insufflation (GI) to increase intrapulmonary oxygen stores and prevent the lungs from dangerous compressions at great depths. Glossopharyngeal insufflation is associated with inflation of the lungs beyond total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). It is currently unknown whether GI transiently over-distends the lungs or adversely affects lung elastic properties in the long-term. Resting lung function, ventilatory drive, muscle strength, and lung compliance were measured in eight BHD who performed GI since 5.5 (range 2-6) years on average, eight scuba divers, and eight control subjects. In five BHD subsequent measures of static lung compliance (Cstat) were obtained after 1 and 3 min following GI. Breath-hold divers had higher than predicted ventilatory flows and volumes and did not differ from control groups with regard to gas transfer, inspiratory muscle strength, and lung compliance. A blunted response to CO2 was obtained in BHD as compared to control groups. Upon GI there was an increase in mean vital capacity (VCGI) by 1.75 +/- 0.85 (SD) L compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.001). In five BHD Cstat raised from 3.7 (range 2.9-6.8) L/kPa at baseline to 8.1 (range 3.4-21.2) L/kPa after maximal GI and thereafter gradually decreased to 5.6 (range 3.3-8.1) L/kPa after 1 min and 4.2 (range 2.7-6.6) L/kPa after 3 min (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that in experienced BHD there is a transient alteration in lung elastic recoil. Resting lung function did not reveal a pattern indicative of altered lung ventilatory or muscle function.",M1
18292419,"The effect of lung expansion and positive end-expiratory pressure on respiratory mechanics in anesthetized children.BACKGROUND: Imaging studies have shown that general anesthesia in children results in atelectasis. Lung recruitment total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) maneuvers plus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are effective in preventing atelectasis. However, physiological changes in children during general anesthesia have not been elucidated. METHODS: In eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated children (median age: 3.5 years; range: 2.3-6.5), we measured static respiratory system elastance (E(st)), flow resistance (R(int)), and elastance and resistance components resulting from tissue viscoelasticity (deltaE and deltaR, respectively) using the constant inflow, end-inspiratory occlusion method preceded by TLC maneuvers, both with zero PEEP (ZEEP) and PEEP (5 cm H2O) for comparison. RESULTS: With constant inspiratory flow V(I) and ZEEP, increases in end-inspiratory lung volume above relaxation volume (tidal volume, V(T)) from 8 to 20 mL x kg(-1) resulted in decreases in E(st) from 1.06 to 0.82 cm H2O x mL(-1) x kg, deltaE from 0.16 to 0.09, and R(int) from 0.13 to 0.11 cm H2O x mL(-1) x s x kg, whereas deltaR increased from 0.08 to 0.12 (P &lt; 0.05). Similar relationships were found with PEEP. Increases in V(I) (8 to 26 mL x s(-1) x kg) with constant V(T) and ZEEP resulted in decreases in E(st) from 1.09 to 0.9 and deltaR from 0.17 to 0.06 (P &lt; 0.01), whereas deltaE and R(int) did not change. There was a similar flow and volume dependence of elastance and resistance with PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: The observed steady decreases in E(st) with increasing V(T) (up to 16 mL/kg with PEEP) indicate marked reductions in end-expiratory relaxation volume (functional residual capacity) even with PEEP. Similarity in results with ZEEP and PEEP suggests that TLC-maneuvers and O2-N2 ventilation prevented airway closure throughout the study.",M1
18280726,"During exercise non-invasive ventilation in chronic restrictive respiratory failure.BACKGROUND: Exercise intolerance limits chronic restrictive respiratory failure (CRF) patients from participating in daily activities. The specific modalities that could improve exercise tolerance in these patients remain to be established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate exercise endurance and associated physiological responses with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise in restrictive CRF patients. METHODS: Eighteen patients (63+/-11 years, total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>)=59+/-16% of predicted value) performed maximal exercise in spontaneous breathing conditions (MWLE) and during two constant workload exercise (CWLE) tests at 75% Pmax, with or without NIV in random order.  NIV Responders  were defined by an increase in CWLE duration of more than 50% when using NIV. RESULTS: For the whole group, CWLE duration when using NIV increased from 5.6+/-4.6 to 9.6+/-8.1 min. Increase in CWLE duration correlated with reduction in heart rate and oxygen desaturation, and dyspnea relief during exercise. NIV responders (n=9) showed more severe lung restriction (TLC: 2.6+/-0.7 versus 3.5+/-1.1L; forced vital capacity: 1.0+/-0.16 versus 1.46+/-0.38 L). At the end of MWLE, responders had a lower Vt (0.60+/-0.09 versus 0.89+/-0.34 L), a higher dead-space ratio (0.51+/-0.06 versus 0.38+/-0.12) and lower oxygen pulse (4.5+/-1.2 versus 7.4+/-3.9 ml/beat). CONCLUSION: In severely restrictive patients, NIV during exercise significantly improved exercise duration and tolerance and increased alveolar ventilation.

18274210,"Differences between Finnish and European reference values for pulmonary diffusing capacity.OBJECTIVES: To compare European (ECSC) and Finnish reference values for single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)). STUDY DESIGN: Finnish reference values for DL(CO), specific diffusing capacity (DL(CO)/VA) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were compared with ECSC reference values calculated for different age, height and weight groups. In addition, 10 healthy subjects performed the test with both the Finnish method (inhaled volume 90% of vital capacity, VC) and the ECSC method (inhaled volume 100% of VC). METHODS: Percentual differences between the ECSC and Finnish reference values for DL(CO), TLC and DL(CO)/VA were calculated. The results of measurements of DL(CO) and TLC by using inhaled volume of 100% of VC and 90% of VC in 10 healthy subjects were compared. RESULTS: The Finnish DL(CO) reference value for men was 3-12% and for women 8-20% smaller than the ECSC reference value. TLC calculated according to Finnish equations was 2-14% greater than that based on ECSC equations. The ECSC reference value for DL(CO)/VA was about 20% greater than the Finnish reference value in men and 30% greater than that in women. The 10 healthy subjects had significantly higher DL(CO) when measured according to the ECSC method as compared with the Finnish one (p &lt; 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The Finnish reference values for DL(CO) were about 10% smaller, but TLC 10% and DL(CO)/VA 20-30% greater than ECSC reference values in subjects of the same age, height, weight and gender. The difference in DL(CO) is explained by the different inhaled lung volumes used in the two methods, the difference in lung volumes probably arising from ethnic differences in thoracic cavity.",M1
18236226,"Airway geometry models of children's lungs for use in dosimetry modeling.Single-path whole-lung and lobar models of the lungs of 11 children between 3 mo and 21 yr of age were developed based on a combination of cast data and published information on distal airway dimensions. The cast data used to generate these models were taken from one of the largest databases of actual measurements in children. The methods used to develop the children's models were based on techniques that have been used to develop adult single-path airway geometry models. Model dimensions for the conducting airways, as well as the estimated dead space, for all children fell within the range of the limited published information. Thus, the method for estimating airway dimensions in adults may be successfully applied to develop estimates of airway dimensions in children. The predicted total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) for the older children (aged 8 to 21 yr) fell within or near the range arising from published scaling equations. The assumptions used to generate the gas exchange region for children 8 yr and older produced results that were reasonably consistent with available physiological data. However, these assumptions do not result in a physiologically consistent gas exchange region for children 3 yr of age and younger; also, to maintain physiologically reasonable relationships between dead space and alveolar volume, the models for children 3 yr of age and younger resulted in predicted TLCs well below those predicted using published scaling equations. These discrepancies may be reflective of dysanaptic growth, in which the alveolar region is growing more rapidly than the airways. The results for children 3 yr of age and under suggest the need for a greater understanding of lung development during this critical period. This is particularly important considering the increasing evidence that exposure to pollutants and other toxicants and allergens during the first 2 yr of life may have long-term consequences on respiratory disease outcomes. Our results suggest that the geometry model airway dimensions for all ages are appropriate for use with dosimetry models, but dosimetry modelers need to assess carefully the reasonableness of TLC and functional residual capacity volumes to which airway dimensions are scaled for children 3 yr of age and under.",M1
18208602,"Maximal respiratory static pressures in patients with different stages of COPD severity.BACKGROUND: In this study, we analyzed maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) values in a stable COPD population compared with normal subjects. We evaluated the possible correlation between functional maximal respiratory static pressures and functional and anthropometric parameters at different stages of COPD. Furthermore, we considered the possible correlation between airway obstruction and MIP and MEP values. SUBJECT AND METHODS: 110 patients with stable COPD and 21 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Patients were subdivided according to GOLD guidelines: 31 mild, 39 moderate and 28 severe. RESULTS: Both MIP and MEP were lower in patients with severe airway impairment than in normal subjects. Moreover, we found a correlation between respiratory muscle function and some functional and anthropometric parameters: FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), FVC (forced vital capacity), PEF (peak expiratory flow), <e>TLC</e> (total lung capacity) and height. MIP and MEP values were lower in patients with severe impairment than in patients with a slight reduction of FEV1. CONCLUSION: The measurement of MIP and MEP indicates the state of respiratory muscles, thus providing clinicians with a further and helpful tool in monitoring the evolution of COPD.",M1
18187616,"Postnatal lung function in the developing rat.Little is known about lung function during early stages of postnatal maturation, although the complex structural changes associated with developing rat lung are well studied. We therefore analyzed corresponding functional (lung volume, respiratory mechanics, intrapulmonary gas mixing, and gas exchange) and structural (alveolar surface area, mean linear intercept length, and alveolar septal thickness) changes of the developing rat lung at 7-90 days. Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) increased from 1.54 +/- 0.07 to 16.7 +/- 2.46 (SD) ml in proportion to body weight, but an increase in body weight exceeded an increase in lung volume by almost twofold. Series dead space volume increased from 0.21 +/- 0.03 to 1.38 +/- 0.08 ml but decreased relative to TLC from 14% to 8%, indicating that parenchymal growth exceeded growth of conducting airways. Diffusing capacity of CO (D(CO)) increased from 8.1 +/- 0.8 to 214.1 +/- 23.5 micromol min(-1) hPa(-1), corresponding to a substantial increase in surface area from 744 +/- 20 to 6,536 +/- 488 cm(2). D(CO) per unit of lung volume is considerably lower in the immature lung, inasmuch as D(CO)/TLC in 7-day-old rats was only 42% of that in adult (90 day-old) rats. In humans, however, infants and adults show comparable specific D(CO). Our functional and structural analysis shows that gas exchange is limited in the immature rat lung. The pivotal step for improvement of gas exchange occurs with the transition from bulk alveolarization to the phase of expansion of air spaces with septal reconstruction and microvascular maturation.",M1
18162388,"The Medical Research Council chronic dyspnea score predicts the survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.BACKGROUND: The Medical Research Council (MRC) chronic dyspnea scale (6-point) is used in different clinical conditions to grade breathlessness on daily activities. We have previously shown that in patients with histologically documented usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF), the MRC dyspnea scale is useful in estimating disease severity. The aim of this study was to further investigate the usefulness of the MRC scale in IPF as a marker of survival. METHODS: The records of 25 patients with histologically documented UIP/IPF were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical parameters, pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gases at the time of diagnosis, as well as survival time were retrieved and recorded for each patient. The impact of the different variables determined at diagnosis on survival was examined using the Kaplan-Meier and uni- and multi-variate Cox-regression analyses. RESULTS: Among the baseline clinical and physiologic parameters determined at the time of IPF diagnosis, the MRC score, the Tiffeneau index, and the total lung capacity were the only significant and independent predictors of survival. In specific, a high MRC score, a high Tiffeneau index, and a low total lung capacity at presentation were associated with shorter survival. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the previous work, our results indicate that the Tiffeneau index and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) are the important determinants of survival in patients with IPF. In addition, we show that the simple MRC chronic dyspnea score estimated at the time of diagnosis is equally predictive of survival and may aid clinicians in assessing the prognosis of new cases of IPF.",M1
18060560,"Mechanisms behind inter-individual differences in lung diffusing capacity.We measured diffusing capacity (DLCO), alveolar membrane properties (D (m)), capillary lung volume (V (c)), and alveolar volume (V (A) ) in 20 healthy subjects (12 males; age 32.4 +/- 13 (SD); BMI 21.7 +/- 3; non smokers) at total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and at approximately 80, 60, and 40% TLC. In all subjects, D (m) increased with lung volume, the increase being significantly greater for higher values of D (m)(TLC): the inter-individual differences can be interpreted by a greater number of alveolar units coupled to a lower thickness of the air-blood barrier (thus a higher alveolar surface to thickness ratio S (A)/tau). On the average, the volume-dependent increase of D (m) from approximately 40 to 100% TLC is less than expected based on geometrical increase of S (A) /tau. In fact, up to approximately 80% TLC, the increase in D (m) closely reflects only the increase of S (A), suggesting  unfolding  of the septa with no appreciable decrease in tau. Conversely, above 80% TLC, the decrease in tau due to parenchymal stretching becomes the main factor affecting D (m). In all subjects, V (c) decreased with increasing lung volume, in line with an increase in parenchymal stretching; the decrease was significantly larger for higher values of V (c) (40% TLC). Possibly reflecting differences in alveolar capillary density. No correlation was found between D (m)(TLC) and V (c)(40%TLC). The individual specificity in the lung volume dependence of V (c) and D (m) can be reasonably described by evaluating the V (c)/D (m) ratio at TLC and at approximately 40%TLC.",M1
17928313,"Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in six seconds as predictors of reduced total lung capacity.The present study aims to derive guidelines that identify patients for whom spirometry can reliably predict a reduced total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). A total of 12,693 lung function tests were analysed on Caucasian subjects, aged 18-70 yrs. Restriction was defined as a reduced TLC. Lower limits of normal (LLN) for TLC were obtained from the European Respiratory Society recommended reference equations. Reference equations from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III were used for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in six seconds (FEV(6)). The performance of FVC and FEV(6) to predict the presence of restriction was studied as follows: 1) using two-by-two (2x2) tables; and 2) by logistic regression analysis. Both analyses were performed in obstructive (defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))/FVC or FEV(1)/FEV(6) &lt;LLN) and nonobstructive subgroups, and separately for males and females. The 2x2 tables showed generally low positive and high negative predictive values for FVC or FEV(6) below their LLN in predicting a reduced TLC. Logistic regression analysis showed that in nonobstructive subjects, restriction can be positively predicted if FVC or FEV(6) is &lt;55% predicted (males) or &lt;40% pred (females). Restriction can be ruled out if FVC or FEV in six seconds is &gt;100% pred (males) or &gt;85% pred (females). In obstructive patients, spirometry cannot reliably diagnose a concomitant restrictive defect, but it can rule out restriction for patients with forced vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in six seconds &gt;85% pred (males) or &gt;70% pred (females).",M1
17806022,"Pulmonary function following completion of Minimally Invasive Repair for Pectus Excavatum (MIRPE).Pulmonary function testing remains part of the routine preoperative investigations in patients with pectus excavatum, although there is evidence that reduced exercise capacity is predominantly due to impaired cardiovascular performance rather than ventilatory limitation. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the change of pulmonary function in patients after completion (metal bar removal) of minimally invasive repair for pectus excavatum compared to the preoperative functional results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent minimally invasive repair for pectus excavatum (MIRPE) between February 2000 and June 2006 and subsequently had their metal bars removed were examined. Pulmonary function tests were performed as part of the routine pre- and postoperative protocol. Vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), residual volume (RV) and maximal expiratory flow rate at 25 % (MEF25) were evaluated. In addition, comparisons were made between patients with a low (&lt;or= 6) and those with a high (&gt; 6) pectus severity index (PSI) to establish the relative pre- to postoperative change of the above-mentioned lung function parameters. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the study (14 males, 1 female). The median age at surgery was 15.9 years. The metal bar(s) were removed after a median of 37 months following the initial operation. Lung function tests were performed at a median of 32 days preoperatively and 129 days after completion of the procedure. Preoperative lung function values lay below population averages. The majority of patients had either a restrictive, obstructive or combined pulmonary disorder. Improvement was observed in all lung function parameters after metal bar removal compared to preoperative values and was significant for VC, FEV1 and the RV/TLC ratios. With regard to the severity of the deformity, although not statistically significant, patients with a higher PSI (&gt; 6) appeared to benefit particularly from the operation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that pulmonary function improves in patients after completion of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. However, a review of the literature suggests that, in all probability, following surgery, patients benefit more with regard to enhanced cardiovascular performance than from improved pulmonary limitations. The value of routine testing of pre- and postoperative lung function in patients with pectus excavatum is questionable.",M1
17767822,"[Changes in pulmonary function in SARS patients during the three-year convalescent period]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the patterns of pulmonary function in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients during three-year convalescent period, and to investigate the changes and the medium and long term effects on pulmonary function of SARS patients. METHODS: Pulmonary function tests were conducted for four times in 37 SARS patients during three-year convalescent period. They were discharged from hospital within one month, three months, one year and three years respectively. At the same time, pulmonary function of 15 healthy persons was examined as controls to be used for comparison. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, there were significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), 25%-75% forced expiratory flow (25%-75%FEF) of SARS patients within three years after their discharge from hospital (all P&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Abnormality rate of DLCO in the SARS patients within three years after discharge was significantly decreased (32.4% vs. 5.4%,P&lt;0.05), but no significant differences in FVC, VC, 25%-75%FEF among SARS patients discharged one month and three years from the hospital (all P&gt;0.05). Ten SARS patients showed lower FVC (mild degree in 9 cases, severe degree in 1 case) three years later, 2 patients showed mildly lowered DLCO. CONCLUSION: The lung diffusion function of the SARS patients had recovered after they were discharged from hospital within three years, but in 20%-30% patients there is still mild or moderate restrictive ventilation function abnormality and small airway function impairment. The lung functions of most patients have recovered gradually, but in a minority of patients they may be impaired.",M1
17762296,"Predictors of change in postoperative pulmonary function in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a prospective study of 254 patients.STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter study of prospectively collected pulmonary function testing and radiographic measures in patients surgically treated for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were 1) to identify the factors that determine pulmonary function more than 2 years after surgery for AIS; and 2) to determine what factors, if any, can predict an increase or decrease in the percent predicted 2-year pulmonary function. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thoracic spinal deformity can lead to significant pulmonary impairment. Studies have shown that patients with AIS experienced a significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function at 2 years after surgery when treated with a posterior approach compared to an anterior approach. METHODS: Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and radiographic examination of 254 patients with AIS were completed prospectively. Demographic data, associations between radiographic measurements of spinal deformity, and the results of spirometry underwent correlation analysis and subsequent step-wise multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The variables found to be significant predictors of 2-year pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, <e>TLC</e>) include: preop PFT (R = 0.20-0.39), having an open thoracotomy (as opposed to thoracoscopic or posterior) (R = 0.07-0.09), surgical time (R = 0.03-0.07), and thoracoplasty (R = 0.02-0.04). These models explain 40 to 51% of the variance in 2-year PFT. For patients undergoing open thoracotomy with a thoracoplasty, approximately 54% had a 15% decrease, or more, in percent predicted PFT. This compared with 11% and 15%, respectively of patients who either had posterior or thoracoscopic procedures with no thoracoplasty that had a 15% decrease or more in percent predicted PFT. CONCLUSION: Aside from preoperative PFT values, open anterior approaches predict the largest percent of variance in 2-year PFT. Additionally, a clinically significant reduction in the predicted 2-year pulmonary function is more likely when performing a thoracoplasty. The magnitude of the effects for both these variables, however, is modest. This may facilitate the decision-making process as regards to operative intervention.",M1
17711915,"Lung function made easy: assessing lung size.Spirometry is available in most GP surgeries and provides an invaluable tool for assessing respiratory function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Spirometry alone may not provide the clinician with an accurate assessment of lung disease as it misses two important measurements of lung volume. By measuring Residual Volume (RV) and Total Lung Capacity (<e>TLC</e>) it is possible to determine true restrictive or hyperinflated disease processes. Helium dilution, body plethysmography and nitrogen washout are three different methods which may be used to measure lung volume. These tests are normally only provided in the acute setting. Comparing values of RV and TLC to predicted values makes it possible to grade the severity of disease far more accurately than spirometry. Four case studies of asthma, obesity, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis clearly demonstrate anomalies that may arise when interpreting lung disease from spirometry compared to the interpretation made with additional lung volume data.",M1
17690147,"The effect of lung volume on the co-ordinated recruitment of scalene and sternomastoid muscles in humans.The human scalenes are obligatory inspiratory muscles that have a greater mechanical advantage than sternomastoid, an accessory muscle. This study determined scalene and sternomastoid recruitment during voluntary inspiratory tasks, and whether this activity varied with lung volume, when feedback from the lungs and inspiratory muscles would differ. If afferent feedback has a major role in determining the recruitment of the scalenes and sternomastoid, then at each lung volume, activity would be altered. Intramuscular EMG from scalene and sternomastoid muscles, and oesophageal pressure were recorded while subjects (n = 7) performed inspiratory isovolumetric ramps to maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and dynamic inspirations from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). The static inspiratory ramps were repeated at three lung volumes: FRC, FRC + tidal volume, and TLC. To determine the profile of inspiratory activation, i.e. the initial and ongoing recruitment of the muscles, the root mean square of the EMG was measured throughout the tasks. Scalene was recruited early, and EMG increased with pressure, reaching a plateau at 80% MIP. In contrast, sternomastoid activity began later, but then increased with pressure from 20 to 100% MIP. Similar profiles of activation occurred at all three lung volumes (n.s.). The ratio of sternomastoid to scalene EMG was also the same irrespective of the initial lung volume (n.s.). In dynamic inspirations, scalene and sternomastoid activation had similar stereotypical profiles to the static tasks, but scalene EMG was 15-40% greater (P &lt; 0.05). Sternomastoid activation was the same in both tasks (n.s.). These results suggest that in voluntary tasks, scalene and sternomastoid are recruited in the order of their mechanical advantages, and that alterations in feedback related to changes in lung volume failed to alter their activation. Thus, in humans, the mechanism responsible for the differential activation of these two inspiratory muscles has an element that is preset.",M1

Emphysema was induced by exposure to aerosolized papain. At 11 or 12 weeks post-papain exposure, dogs received oral RA (2 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks, and were followed for an additional 4 weeks after stopping RA treatment. In all dogs, lung injury increased in the first 11-12 weeks following papain exposure, as evidenced by increasing trends of inspiratory capacity IC, TLC, EAD, and AD, and a decreasing trend of FEV0.5/FVC. These parameters of lung injury partially and transiently reversed their trends between 2 and 6 weeks following the initiation of RA treatment. A sham RA-treated group was not studied. However, similar reversals of lung injury were not seen in a previous study of dogs treated with papain but not RA, suggesting that RA altered emphysema progression in the current study. The limited reversal of lung injury in this study contrasts with more pronounced treatment effects seen in previous studies with rats. This paper discusses possible reasons for differences in these studies, as well as suggestions for improved experimental investigations of emphysema therapies.",M1
17474634,"[A twenty-year research on the pathogenesis of functional disorders of the respiratory tract in children and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis]The aim of this study was to assess functional efficiency of the respiratory tract in relation to the progression of idiopathic scoliosis. Within twenty years examinations were carried out in a group of 300 children aged 10-19 years with idiopathic scoliosis grade I according to Cobb (spinal curvature up to 30 degrees) and in the group of 100 children aged 12-19 years with progressive scoliosis grades II, III, IV (from 50 to 100 degrees according to Cobb). All the children were the patients of the Orthopaedic and Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinic. The control group were healthy children at the same age as the studied group without ailments of the respiratory tract as well as the osseous--muscular and nervous system. The children with scoliosis grade I according to Cobb were first assessed psychologically and then subjected to anthropometric examination. All the children were participants of Scout Healthcare Camps. Before and after a four-week rehabilitation camp and after paediatric examination spirometric measurements were done using Vitalograph and the following indexes were determined FVC, FVC%N, FEF1, FEF1%N, FEV1%FVC, MMEF, MMEF%N and PEF, PEF%N. During the stay at the camp the children did intensive physical and pulmonary exercises. On the basis of 5-year observations and spirometric examinations disorders in somatic development were shown in children in the initial stage of idiopathic scoliosis. In the studied group of children in the initial stage of scoliosis no disturbances in basic spirometric indexes were found. Vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one sec. (FEV1) were within the norm. Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is the first index indicating the dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract in children with scoliosis grade I. Intensive exercise and daily pulmonary rehabilitation improved ventilatory lung indexes FVC, FEV1. However, changes in the peripheral respiratory tracts defined by MMEF did not improve despite intensive pulmonary rehabilitation. Apart from this, in children with progressive scoliosis pletysmographic measurements were performed using Body-Master-Laab, Jaeger. The following indexes were defined: residual volume-RV, Intrathoracic gas volume-ITGV and total lung capacity-<e>TLC</e>. Total resistance of the bronchial tree was measured. In children with idiopathic scoliosis grades II, III (mean 63 degrees according to Cobb) statistically significantly decreased values of lung capacity and volume were determined: TLC, ITGV, FVC and FEV1, PEF. The reduced values of all measured indexes of flow volume curve MEF75%VC, MEF50%VC, MEF25%VC were shown. Maximum expiratory flows in relation to total lung capacity TLC and vital capacity FVC, determined as so called compensatory indexes, were calculated.",M1
17469148,"Lung tissue mechanics predict lung hypoplasia in a rabbit model for congenital diaphragmatic hernia.Several animal models have been proposed to study the pathophysiology of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Surgical induction of CDH in fetal rabbits during the pseudoglandular phase has been shown to induce severe pulmonary hypoplasia, but functional studies in this model are scarce. We aimed to measure neonatal pulmonary impedance and related it to the severity of lung hypoplasia. CDH was surgically created in rabbits at 23 days of gestation. Following cesarean delivery at term (31 days) pups were subjected to measurement of total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), lung to body weight ratio (LBWR) and lung impedance by forced oscillation technique (FOT). Airway resistance (R(aw)), tissue elastance (H(L)), tissue damping (G(L)), and hysteresivity (eta) (G(L)/H(L)) were calculated from impedance data. Twelve CDH fetuses and 15 controls were available for final analysis. LBWR and TLC were significantly lower in the CDH group compared to gestational and age matched controls (P&lt;0.001). R(aw), H(L), and G(L) were significantly increased in CCDH fetuses. eta and H(L) best reflected lung hypoplasia (LBWR) (r(2) = 0.42 and 0.43; P=0.001), indicating a dominant contribution of lung tissue mechanics to CDH-induced lung hypoplasia. We successfully introduced lung impedance measurement by FOT in neonatal rabbits. Following surgical induction of CDH in the pseudoglandular phase, they have, next to morphological evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia, changes in lung mechanics. Our results for lung tissue mechanics support the concept of delayed pulmonary tissue modeling. We propose to employ functional studies in future experiments when evaluating prenatal interventions aimed at reversing pulmonary hypoplasia.",M1
17419042,"Reference values for dynamic and static pulmonary compliance in men.The aim of the present study was to determine new reference values and predictive variables for dynamic and static pulmonary compliance in men. The investigation was conducted as a prospective study in healthy, non-smoking men with normal pulmonary function parameters including spirometry, bodyplethysmography and CO diffusing capacity. The esophageal pressure method was used to measure dynamic compliance (Cdyn), specific dynamic compliance (Cdyn/ITGV), static compliance (Cstat) and specific static compliance (Cstat/ITGV). Lung recoil pressures were recorded at different levels of total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). A total of 208 men aged 20-69 years were included in the study. The mean values for the compliance parameters were: Cdyn: 2.91+/-1.08 L/kPa; Cdyn/ITGV: 0.71 +/- 0.30 kPa (-1); Cstat: 3.34 +/- 1.04 L/kPa; Cstat/ITGV: 0.82 +/- 0.31 kPa (-1). Cdyn, Cdyn/ITGV and Cstat/ITGV were significantly correlated with age and Cstat was related to height, but in multiple regression analyses the predictability for compliance parameters was very low. Lung recoil pressures at all TLC levels significantly decreased with ageing. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the contribution of anthropometric variables to the regression equations of pulmonary compliance was low. With ageing the static pressure-volume curve of the lung shifted to the left without substantial alteration of the slope.",M1
17356081,"Tiotropium and simplified detection of dynamic hyperinflation.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To detect dynamic hyperinflation (DH) by evaluating reduction in inspiratory capacity (IC) during metronome-paced hyperventilation (MPH) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, studied before and after treatment with tiotropium. METHODS: IC and FEV(1) were measured before and immediately after MPH at two times resting the respiratory rate for 20 s in 60 COPD patients (28 men; mean age, 66 +/- 10 years [+/- SD]) before and after 30 days of treatment with tiotropium bromide, 18 mug. Patients were encouraged to maintain a constant tidal volume during MPH. RESULTS: At baseline, mean FEV(1) was 1.5 +/- 0.1 L (+/- SE) [57 +/- 1.6% of predicted], mean FVC was 2.6 +/- 0.1L (77 +/- 1.8% of predicted), and mean FEV(1)/FVC was 56 +/- 1%. After 180 mug of aerosolized albuterol sulfate, mean FEV(1) was 1.7 +/- 0.1 L (63 +/- 1.5% of predicted) [p &lt; 0.001] and mean FEV(1)/FVC was 58 +/- 1%. Compared to baseline, after 30 days and 1.5 h after tiotropium there was an increase in IC of 0.18 +/- 0.04L (p &lt; 0.0001); FEV(1) of 0.13 +/- 0.03 L (5.6 +/- 0.8% of predicted; p = 0.0002); FVC of 0.22 +/- 0.05 L (6.5 +/- 1.3% of predicted; p &lt; 0.001); and decrease in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV)/total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) of - 3.1 +/- 0.6% (p = 0.0001); a decrease in end-inspiratory lung volume (EILV)/TLC of - 2.9 +/- 1.3% (p = 0.03); and no change in TLC (- 0.06 +/- 0.05 L). Results following MPH-induced DH at baseline and after 30 days of tiotropium were similar, with decreases in IC (- 0.35 +/- 0.03 L; p &lt; 0.001); FEV(1) (- 0.05 +/- 0.04 L; p = 0.2); and FVC (- 0.22 +/- 0.03 L; p &lt; 0.0001); no change in TLC; and increases in EELV/TLC (11.8 +/- 1.0% of predicted; p &lt; 0.0001) and EILV/TLC (4.0 +/- 1.3% of predicted, p &lt; 0.003). CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, tiotropium did not reduce MPH-induced DH and reduction in IC, compared to baseline. However, because tiotropium induced bronchodilation and increased baseline IC, lower operational lung volumes may blunt the effect of MPH-induced DH. The noninvasive simplicity of MPH-induced DH provides a clinically useful screening surrogate to monitor changes in IC following treatment with tiotropium.",M1
17304137,"Thoracoscopic scoliosis surgery affects pulmonary function less than thoracotomy at 2 years postsurgery.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of pulmonary function before and 2 years after surgery following anterior scoliosis instrumentation. OBJECTIVES: To determine if thoracoscopic anterior scoliosis correction with instrumentation affected pulmonary function less than open thoracotomy approaches at 2 years follow-up. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The thoracoscopic approach has been shown to have a smaller reduction in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) compared with an open thoracotomy approach following anterior thoracic instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the immediate postoperative period; however, it is unclear if a difference remains 2 years following the procedure. METHODS: A total of 107 patients in a multicenter adolescent idiopathic scoliosis database underwent an anterior instrumented fusion for thoracic scoliosis. PFTs assessing forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were obtained prospectively before and 2 years after surgery. The patients were grouped as follows: Group I, thoracoscopic instrumented fusion (n = 36); Group II, open (thoracotomy) instrumented fusion without thoracoplasty (n = 28); and Group III, open instrumented fusion with thoracoplasty (n = 43). RESULTS: Thoracoscopic instrumentation affected pulmonary function 2 years after surgery minimally, and on an average showed improvements in all parameters except the percent-predicted FVC, which decreased by 1% +/- 11%, and percent predicted FEV, which decreased by 2% +/- 9%. Improvements were noted in absolute FVC, FEV1, TLC, and percent-predicted TLC. This is in contrast to the patients treated with a thoracotomy, who had a greater persistent reduction in PFTs at follow-up. An added thoracoplasty to the thoracotomy approach, however, resulted in even greater residual reduction in PFTs at follow-up, with declines in percent-predicted FVC of 15%, percent-predicted FEV1 of 14%, and percent-predicted TLC of 8%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a clear advantage to the minimally invasive thoracoscopic approach with regards to pulmonary function when compared with the open thoracotomy approaches.",M1
17301929,"Comparison between total lung capacity and residual volume values obtained by pletysmography and single breath methods with methane.We analyzed pulmonary function tests of twenty asthmatic patients from Gaffrée e Guinle University Hospital, classified according to Brazilian Guidelines for Asthma (2002), similar to GINA, into mild persistent or moderate (9) or severe (11) asthma. We obtained parameters from spirometry, plethysmograph (PL) and single breath technique for diffusion capacity (SB), with methane. Total lung capacity and residual volume were called <e>TLC</e>(PL) and RV(PL) when measured by pletysmography and TLC(SB) and RV(SB) when determined by single breath test. There were 13 women and 7 men with mean age of 47.6 years. The pulmonary dysfunction degree to FEV1/FVC was 58.8% with CI95=53.9 to 63.6. The mean values in litres for TLC(PL) (5.94) and RV(PL) (2.55) were significantly higher than for TLC(SB) (4.73) and RV(SB) (1.66). Multiple regression equations were determined for TLC(PL) e RV(PL) using only single breath values, TLC(SB) or RV(SB), and spirographic para- meters, with significant regression coefficients. However, the inclusion of spirometric parameters, except for FVC, did not improve the predicted capacity for the equations. Considering only the TLC(SB), r(2)=0.79, the equation is: TLC(PL)=(TLC(SB) *1.025)+1.088, with EPE=0.64. The regression for RV(PL), r(2) =0.23, is: RV(PL)=(RV(SB) *0.9268)+1.012. The results obtained after bronchodilation with 400 mcg of salbutamol did not improve the regression. We concluded that the SB technique did not obtain the same results as pletysmography for TLC and RV, but for TLC this difference can be predicted.",M1
17298466,"Total lung capacity: single breath methane dilution versus plethysmography in normals.OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Methane is an inert tracer gas used to obtain <e>TLC</e> estimates during single breath diffusion capacity (DL(CO)) measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of methane dilution TLC in normal subjects undergoing single breath diffusion capacity measurements using plethysmography as the gold standard comparison method. METHODS: Fifty non-smoking adults underwent lung function testing. Total lung volume was obtained by both plethysmography and methane dilution during a single breath DL(CO) measurement. Deming regression and the concordance correlation coefficient, r(ccc), were used to determine agreement between methods for TLC. Bias was the mean difference between methods and limits of agreement were the mean difference between methods +/- 1.96 (SD). All values are mean +/- SD unless otherwise stated. RESULTS: Plethysmography and methane dilution TLC values were not significantly different. The r(ccc) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.92). Deming regression revealed a slope of 0.93 (P = 0.17, H(o): beta = 1.0; 95% CI 0.84-1.03) and a y-intercept of 0.20 (P = 0.39, H(o): alpha = 0; 95% CI -0.27-0.70). The bias was 0.11 L favouring plethysmography. Limits of agreement varied as 0.11 +/- 0.92 L. CONCLUSIONS: There is statistical agreement between methods suggesting the average TLC by methane could substitute for plethysmography in normals at the population level. At the individual level, a normal methane dilution value indicates a normal TLC whereas values below the normal range should be validated using plethysmography.",M1
17063994,"Respiratory evaluation of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis prior to renal transplantation.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) are important in predicting preoperative pulmonary complications and mortality rate in potentially renal transplant recipients. There is no adequate clinical research aimed at learning the effect of empty and full status of the peritoneal cavity on PFTs and CPET for estimating decide PFTs and CPET timing in preoperative evaluation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PFT and CPET results are altered in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) according to the presence of dialysis solution in the abdomen. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 22 subjects were included (12 male, 10 female, mean age 29.64 +/- 8.29 years, CAPD duration, 37.35 +/- 7.15 months). Data were collected from each patient when the peritoneal cavity was filled with solution (full status) and again when the cavity had been drained (empty status). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), and residual volume (RV) were calculated. Peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) and exercise duration were determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RESULTS: When the peritoneal cavity was empty, mean (+/- SD) values for the parameters tested were % predicted FEV1: 85 +/- 17%, %FEV1/FVC: 84 +/- 8%, % predicted TLC: 98 +/- 17%, % predicted RV: 108 +/- 25%, % predicted DLCO: 90 +/- 14%, peak VO2: 43 +/- 11 ml/kg/min, test duration: 6.8 +/- 1.6 min. When the peritoneal cavity was full, mean (+/- SD) values were % predicted FEV1: 86 +/- 17%, %FEV1/FVC: 83 +/- 7%, % predicted TLC: 91 +/- 14%, % predicted RV: 95 +/- 22%, % predicted DLCO: 87 +/- 16%, peak VO2: 42 +/- 8 ml/kg/min, test duration 6.5 +/- 1.7 min. % predicted FEV1, %FEV1/FVC, % predicted DLCO and peak VO2 were not statistically significant between the mean values at empty status versus those at full status (p &lt; 0.05 for all). There were significant decreases between the mean values for % predicted TLC and % predicted RV at full status versus empty status (p &lt; 0.002 for TLC, p &lt; 0.001 for RV). No statistically significant correlation was found between PFTs and % change ratio of dialysate. CONCLUSION: FEV1, %FEV1/FVC, % predicted DLCO and CPET test results do not differ according to abdomen status in CAPD patients suggesting that the timing of PFT maneuver does not affect preoperative transplantation evaluation. Therefore, when evaluating the results of these tests prior to transplantation period, the presence of dialysis solution in the abdomen may be ignored.",M1
17049439,"Inter-session reproducibility of peak expiratory flow with standardized expiratory maneuvers.BACKGROUND: In adults performing forceful expiratory maneuvers, the length of post-inspiratory pause prior to forced expiration may influence the subsequently measured peak expiratory flow (PEF) and increase its variability. We investigated the effects of two different lengths of breath-hold at total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) on the short-term reproducibility of PEF in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Forty-six healthy volunteers (age 34.6+/-8.5; 23 men) performed a series of maximal forceful expirations in two different test sessions, separated by approximately 2 weeks. In each test-session, PEF was measured with two different types of maneuvers. One maneuver (P) included a brief (&lt;2s) post-inspiratory pause at TLC prior to forced expiration, whereas the second maneuver (NP) included no pause at TLC. The speed of inspiration to TLC was fast and similar for both maneuvers. In a given test session, all volunteers performed four efforts for each type of maneuver. The highest PEF for each maneuver was used for analysis. The Bland-Altman statistical analysis was used to determine inter-session reproducibility of PEF. RESULTS: Within-maneuver analysis of the between-test session reproducibility of PEF showed that neither maneuver systematically biased the measured PEF (mean difference 0.02L/s for the P and 0.17L/s for the NP maneuver). Inter-maneuver between-test session analysis similarly showed that neither maneuver introduced a systematic bias in the maximal PEF (mean difference ranged from -0.15 to -0.01L/s). The limits of agreement were comparable in all maneuver-pair analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Forceful expiratory maneuvers with or without a brief (&lt;2s) pause at TLC produce comparable PEF values in test-retest sessions.",M1
17045933,"Medical and psychologic outcome of living lobar lung transplant donors.BACKGROUND: Living donor lobar lung transplantation is a viable therapy for carefully selected patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Its success is largely dependent upon donor outcome, including both physical and emotional factors. To date, there has been little focus on psychosocial outcomes of lobar lung donors. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 15 of 20 living lobar lung transplant donors was performed. Donors underwent evaluation of pulmonary function after recovery from donor lobectomy. Participants completed two self-report questionnaires, the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as an open-ended psychiatric interview. RESULTS: After lobar donation, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) decreased by 21 +/- 2%, forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased by 16 +/- 3%, total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) decreased by 15 +/- 3%, and single-breath diffusing capacity (DLCO) decreased by 14 +/- 4%. All subjects scored higher than the national average on both the physical and mental health components of the SF-36. The BDI scores showed no evidence of clinical depression. However, the subjective interviews elicited two common complaints: (1) a decline in exercise performance, not accounted for by resting lung function measurements; and (2) a dissatisfaction with the degree of acknowledgment of their donation. CONCLUSIONS: Living lobar lung transplant donors enjoy generally satisfactory physical and emotional health. Donors report positive feelings about donation, but wish to be recognized and valued by the transplant team and by the recipient. Despite preservation of lung function within the normal range, some donors also experience a subjective decline in exercise tolerance. Long-term medical and psychologic follow-up appears warranted to monitor symptoms of exercise impairment and to enhance the donor experience.",M1
17023857,"Recovery of pulmonary function following endoscopic anterior scoliosis correction: evaluation at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.STUDY DESIGN: A series of patients with scoliosis undergoing endoscopic anterior instrumentation and fusion undertaking repeated pulmonary function assessments. OBJECTIVE: To assess recovery of pulmonary function in the 2 years following endoscopic anterior scoliosis correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent studies have found that pulmonary function returns to preoperative levels 12-24 months following endoscopic anterior scoliosis correction, and a small improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) has also been reported. METHODS: A series of 44 patients with endoscopic anterior scoliosis correction had pulmonary function tests before surgery, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were measured. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used to investigate changes in pulmonary function between successive assessments. RESULTS: Pulmonary function decreased by approximately 10% at 3 months after surgery. At 24 months after surgery, FVC and FEV1 recovered to 5% to 8% higher than preoperative levels, while TLC returned to preoperative levels. Statistically significant improvements in most pulmonary function values occurred between 3 and 6, and 6-12 months. Improvements in mean FVC, FEV1, and TLC continue between 12 and 24 months, although only the increase in absolute FVC for this time is statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic anterior scoliosis surgery has no lasting negative effect on pulmonary function, and with prolonged follow-up, pulmonary capacity improves beyond preoperative levels.",M1
16948350,"Functional assessment of allergic asthmatic children while asymptomatic.The aim of this study was to detect the best test lung function to identify abnormalities in asthmatic children while asymptomatic. We studied 200 asthmatic children. Patients were evaluated by questionnaire to evaluate the presence of symptoms and drug consumption in the previous 3 months. Allergological evaluation by skin-prick tests and seric-specific IgE determination for relevant local inhalant allergens was made. Lung function was studied evaluating expiratory flows and measuring lung volumes by nitrogen washout technique. One hundred twenty-seven of 200 (63%) children showed functional abnormalities: 21 (10.5%) children had flow reductions, 56 (28%) children had volume modifications, and 50 (25%) children had either flow and lung volume alterations, respectively. We observed increased total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), residual volume (RV), and ratio RV/TLC values more often in patients with mild and moderate persistent asthma than in patients with intermittent asthma. No significant difference was detected considering expiratory flows. Measurements of lung volumes are an important tool to evaluate  air trapping  in asthmatic patients and this could be related to disease severity. According to the literature, our data suggest that an increase of RV, functional residual capacity RV/TLC could be the only functional airway dysfunction present in asthmatic children during asymptomatic period.",M1
16804290,"Relationship between exhaled breath condensate volume and measurements of lung volumes.BACKGROUND: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is proving to be a technique which can sample markers of lung inflammation; however, many factors affect the collection process. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesised that lung volumes--tidal volume, minute volume and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>)--would dictate the volume of the EBC sample that could be collected. METHODS: First, the volume of EBC collected was measured while measuring the tidal volume and minute volume in normal, asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects. Second, the volume of EBC was compared between breathing at tidal volumes and breathing at vital capacity in normal subjects. TLC was measured by plethysmography. RESULTS: The mean EBC volume was 5.55 +/- 0.50 microl/breath in normal subjects (n = 23), 3.56 +/- 0.33 microl/breath in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients (n = 25) and 5.77 +/- 0.50 microl/breath in asthmatic subjects (n = 17). EBC volume was significantly correlated with both tidal volume (Pearson's r = 0.775, p &lt; 0.0005) and minute volume (Pearson's r = 0.425, p &lt; 0.0005), but importantly, EBC volume was not significantly affected by age, gender or disease status. There was a significant difference in EBC volume when tidal breathing was compared with breathing at vital capacity (5.55 +/- 0.50 vs. 20.59 +/- 1.72 microl; p &lt; 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between EBC volume and TLC (21 normal subjects). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that tidal and minute volume can predict the amount of EBC that can be expected to be collected. No significant differences in the volume of EBC were seen between normal subjects and those with airway diseases.",M1
16797172,"Restrictive impairment in patients with asthma.BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma have intermittent or persistent airflow obstruction, most often manifested spirometrically by reduced forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) and FEV(1)/vital capacity (VC) ratio. In some patients, the VC may be reduced by air trapping, with an increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) (pseudorestriction). We have reported 12 asthmatic patients with reduced VC and no increase in RV, i.e., a true restrictive impairment [Gill et al. True restrictive impairment in bronchial asthma. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999:159:A652]. OBJECTIVES: To confirm previous observations of true restrictive impairment (not attributable to air trapping) in patients with asthma, and to estimate its frequency in an asthmatic population. METHODS: Review of pulmonary function tests and clinical records of all post-pubertal patients diagnosed as asthma between January 2000 and September 2003 in a 184 bed inner city teaching hospital in Jamaica, Queens, New York. The clinical diagnosis of asthma was accepted when one or more of the following pulmonary function criteria were met: Positive bronchodilator response (BD), positive methacholine, repeated variability in spirometric values. Restriction was defined as decrease in total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) or decrease in VC with no increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) plus normal or high FEV(1)/FVC ratio. Patients with any clinical finding consistent with restriction, including a decreased diffusing capacity (DL) or obesity (BMI &gt;30) were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 100 of 413 (24%) patients with asthma had restriction; 21 of these met all exclusions (including DL and BMI) and 11 (of 46) patients with an increased BMI and normal DL normalized their FVC on BD therapy, demonstrating that their pre-BD restrictive impairment could not be attributed to obesity. Plethysmographic FRC was measured in 81 of the 100 patients with restriction and was increased in only seven. CONCLUSION: True restrictive impairment was noted in at least 32 of 413 asthmatics (8%), consistent with previous observations in asthma and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. This finding is not widely recognized and should not preclude the diagnosis of asthma, BD testing or appropriate therapy for asthma.",M1
16769715,"Association between markers of emphysema and more severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.BACKGROUND: The predominant emphysema phenotype is associated with more severe airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study was undertaken to investigate whether COPD patients, with or without emphysema quantitatively confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), have different COPD severity as assessed by the BODE index (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise performance) and inspiratory capacity to total lung capacity ratio (IC/<e>TLC</e>), and by different biological markers of lung parenchymal destruction. METHODS: Twenty six outpatients with COPD and eight healthy non-smokers were examined. Each subject underwent HRCT scanning, pulmonary function tests, cell counts, and measurements of neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in induced sputum, as well as measurement of desmosine, a marker of elastin degradation in urine, plasma and sputum. RESULTS: Patients with HRCT confirmed emphysema had a higher BODE index and lower IC/TLC ratio than subjects without HRCT confirmed emphysema and controls. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/forced vital capacity ratio, and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient were lower, whereas the number of eosinophils, MMP-9, and the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in sputum were higher in patients with emphysema. In COPD patients the number of sputum eosinophils was the biological variable that correlated positively with the HRCT score of emphysema (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that COPD associated with HRCT confirmed emphysema is characterised by more severe lung function impairment, more intense airway inflammation and, possibly, more serious systemic dysfunction than COPD not associated with HRCT confirmed emphysema.",M1
16690794,"Features of glossopharyngeal breathing in breath-hold divers.One technique employed by competitive breath-hold divers to increase diving depth is to hyperinflate the lungs with glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB). Our aim was to assess the relationship between measured volume and pressure changes due to GPB. Seven healthy male breath-hold divers, age 33 (8) [mean (SD)] years were recruited. Subjects performed baseline body plethysmography (<e>TLC</e>(PRE)). Plethysmography and mouth relaxation pressure were recorded immediately following a maximal GPB maneuver at total lung capacity (TLC) (TLC(GPB)) and within 5 min after the final GPB maneuver (TLC(POST)). Mean TLC increased from TLC(PRE) to TLC(GPB) by 1.95 (0.66) liters and vital capacity (VC) by 1.92 (0.56) liters (P &lt; 0.0001), with no change in residual volume. There was an increase in TLC(POST) compared with TLC(PRE) of 0.16 liters (0.14) (P &lt; 0.02). Mean mouth relaxation pressure at TLC(GPB) was 65 (19) cmH(2)O and was highly correlated with the percent increase in TLC (R = 0.96). Breath-hold divers achieve substantial increases in measured lung volumes using GPB primarily from increasing VC. Approximately one-third of the additional air was accommodated by air compression.",M1
16542200,"Plethysmography and impulse oscillometry assessment of tiotropium and ipratropium bromide; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in healthy subjects.AIMS: Spirometry, plethysmography and impulse oscillometry (IOS) measure different aspects of lung function. These methods have not been compared for their ability to assess long- and short-acting anticholinergic agents. We therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over study in 30 healthy subjects. METHODS: Single doses of tiotropium bromide (Tio) 54 and 18 mcg, ipratropium bromide (IB) 40 mcg and placebo were administered. Specific conductance (sGaw), total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), inspiratory capacity (IC) and residual volume (RV) were measured using plethysmography, while IOS measured resistance (R5-25) and reactance (RF and X5). Pulmonary function was measured for 26 h post dose. RESULTS: Tio caused significant improvements in sGaw, forced expiratory voume in 1 s (FEV(1)), maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) and R5-R25 at time points up to 26 h, with no clear differences between doses. IB improved the same parameters, but only up to 8 h. The weighted mean change (0-24 h) caused by Tio 54 mcg compared with placebo for FEV(1) was 240 ml (95% confidence interval 180, 300), while for sGaw the ratio of geometric means (Tio compared with placebo) was 1.35 (1.28, 1.41). Neither drug caused consistent statistically significant changes in RF, forced vital capacity, TLC or IC over 26 h. RV was significantly improved from 8 to 24 h by Tio 54 mcg only. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to spirometry, IOS resistance measurements and sGaw can distinguish between the effects of long- and shortacting anticholinergic effects in healthy subjects.",M1
16469934,"The structural basis of airways hyperresponsiveness in asthma.We hypothesized that structural airway remodeling contributes to airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. Small, medium, and large airways were analyzed by computed tomography in 21 asthmatic volunteers under baseline conditions (FEV1 = 64% predicted) and after maximum response to albuterol (FEV1 = 76% predicted). The difference in pulmonary function between baseline and albuterol was an estimate of AHR to the baseline smooth muscle tone (BSMT). BSMT caused an increase in residual volume (RV) that was threefold greater than the decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) because of a simultaneous increase in total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). The decrease in FVC with BSMT was the major determinant of the baseline FEV1 (P &lt; 0.0001). The increase in RV correlated inversely with the relaxed luminal diameter of the medium airways (P = 0.009) and directly with the wall thickness of the large airways (P = 0.001). The effect of BSMT on functional residual capacity (FRC) controlled the change in TLC relative to the change in RV. When the FRC increased with RV, TLC increased and FVC was preserved. When the relaxed large airways were critically narrowed, FRC and TLC did not increase and FVC fell. With critical large airways narrowing, the FRC was already elevated from dynamic hyperinflation before BSMT and did not increase further with BSMT. FEV1/FVC in the absence of BSMT correlated directly with large airway luminal diameter and inversely with the fall in FVC with BSMT. These findings suggest that dynamic hyperinflation caused by narrowing of large airways is a major determinant of AHR in asthma.",M1
16456732,"[Evaluation of dynamic hyperinflation parameters and exercise capacity at maximal exercise in patients with COPD]Hyperinflation is an important limiting factor for exercise performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hyperinflation can be determined by measuring residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) at rest, and by measuring inspiratory capacity (IC) and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) at maximal exercise. This study aimed to evaluate changes in hyperinflation parameters on maximal exercise in subjects with COPD. Patients with clinically stable COPD (n= 43) and healthy controls (n= 14) were included. Subjects performed pulmonary function tests and an incremental exercise test on cycle ergometry. Statistically significant differences (p&lt; 0.05) were found regarding exercise test parameters including exercise duration, maximum oxygen uptake, breathing reserve, maximum minute ventilation, and breathing pattern between groups. There was significant increase in EELV (p&lt; 0.05) and decrease in IC (p&lt; 0.05) at maximum exercise when hyperinflation parameters were compared at baseline and maximum exercise. Our results showed that hyperinflation was evident at maximal exercise, although there were no hyperinflation findings at rest in subjects with COPD. We believe that in patients with COPD, it is better to evaluate hyperinflation at maximal exercise than at rest.",M1
16364856,"Donor total lung capacity predicts recipient total lung capacity after size-reduced lung transplantation.BACKGROUND: Size-reduced lung transplantation has only recently undergone widespread use, especially in highly urgent cases. However, it is still not considered standard procedure at most centers. It has the potential to alleviate the donor organ shortage by allowing the use of oversized grafts for small and pediatric recipients. Limited data exist on pre-operative parameters predicting functional outcome after lung transplantation in general, especially after size-reduced lung transplantation. METHODS: All 98 patients undergoing primary lung transplantation during a 2-year period, including 27 size-reduced lung transplantations, were analyzed retrospectively. Pre-operative functional parameters were-after correction of estimated values according to the amount of size reduction-correlated with post-operative functional assessment. Actual and predicted total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) of transplant recipients and predicted TLC of donors was compared with the best post-operative TLC achieved within 12 months after transplantation. RESULTS: Size-reduced lung transplantation was performed in 27 cases. Downsizing was achieved by lobar transplantation (n = 9), split-lung transplantation (n = 2) or peripheral segmental resection (n = 16). There was a statistically highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) correlation between donor TLC and best recipient TLC achieved after transplantation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.675). No statistically significant correlation was seen between pre-operative recipient actual TLC and best post-operative TLC (p = 0.87; Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.415). In standard lung transplant recipients post-operative TLC was correlated with both donor predicted TLC (p &lt; 0.01; Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.509) and actual pre-operative recipient TLC (p &lt; 0.01; Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.667). CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative recipient TLC in size-reduced lung transplantation can be predicted by donor TLC rather than pre-operative recipient TLC.",M1
16364161,"Nitrogen washout slope in poorly controlled asthma.Short-term control of asthma is often lacking even though forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) remains above normal value. Small airways are a potential key site of persistent inflammation and structural modification. Noninvasive assessment of small airways was found to be difficult, but the computerized single breath nitrogen washout test (SBNT) has been recently successfully reintroduced with this aim. Twenty-four asthmatics (13 females) of various severity but with normal FEV1 were compared with 24 healthy volunteers (13 females) and studied at steady-state after bronchodilatation (400 microg salbutamol). Spirometric values, plethysmographic data, phase III (slope of phase III of the SBNT, dN2) and IV [closing volume (CV), with closing capacity (CC) = CV + residual volume (RV)] of the SBNT were checked. Asthma severity, recent control, exacerbation rate, and therapy requirements were assessed on the basis of validated questionnaires (ACQ) and international guidelines. Patients were prospectively pooled into two equal groups according to their exacerbation rate. The reproducibility of the measurements obtained on 2 following days was assessed. All plethysmographic values, except total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), differentiated asthmatic patients from controls. The CC/TLC [124 (117-148) vs 117 (112-123), P = 0.04] and dN2 [110 (99-190) vs 94 (75-111), P = 0.02] were increased in asthma. The dN2 was significantly increased in patients with frequent exacerbations [100 (83-105) vs 195 (141-212), P = 0.0005]. A correlation was obtained between dN2 and recent asthma control (rho: 0.62; P = 0.003), number of exacerbations (rho: 0.71, P = 0.0008), and RV/TLC (rho: 0.49, P = 0.026). This study demonstrated that ventilation inequalities assessed by dN2 represent an important indicator of poor asthma control and high exacerbation rate in high symptom perceivers. New therapies focused on small airways should now be developed.",M1
16357074,"Growth of the small airways and alveoli from childhood to the adult lung measured by aerosol-derived airway morphometry.Understanding the human development of pulmonary air spaces is important for calculating the dose from exposure to inhaled materials as a function of age. We have measured, in vivo, the air space caliber of the small airways and alveoli at their natural full distension [total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>)] by aerosol-derived airway morphometry in 53 children of age 6-22 yr and 59 adults of age 23-80 yr. Aerosol-derived airway morphometry utilizes the gravitational settling time of inhaled inert particles to infer the vertical distance necessary to produce the observed loss of particles to the airway surfaces at sequential depths into the lung. Previously, we identified anatomical features of the lung: the caliber of the transitional bronchioles [transitional effective air space dimension (EADtrans)]; the mean linear dimension of the alveoli (EADmin); and a measure of conducting airway volume [volumetric lung depth (VLDtrans)]. In the present study, we found that EADmin increased with age, from 184 microm at age 6 to 231 microm at age 22, generally accounting for the increase in TLC observed over this age range. EADtrans did not increase with TLC, averaging 572 microm, but increased with subject age and height when the entire age range of 6-80 yr is included {EADtrans (microm)=0.012[height (cm)]x[age (yr)]+508; P=0.007}. VLDtrans scaled linearly with lung volume, but VLDtrans relative to TLC did not change with age, averaging 7.04+/-1.55% of TLC. The data indicate that from childhood (age of 6 yr) to adulthood a constant number of respiratory units is maintained while both the smallest bronchioles and alveoli expand in size to produce the increased lung volume with increased age and height.",M1
16140541,"Changes in pulmonary function test and cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity in COPD patients after lobar pulmonary resection.OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) and Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing (C-PET) are useful to evaluate operability in functionally compromised patients. Although modifications of PFT and C-PET after lung surgery have been widely explored, little information exists as to modifications of exercise capacity in COPD patients undergoing lung resection. We prospectively analyzed the changes in PFT and C-PET in patients with COPD after a pulmonary lobar resection. METHODS: From January 2003 to March 2004 all patients scheduled for lung resection were considered for participation in the study protocol. Those patients with a preoperative diagnosis of COPD on PFT were explored through a C-PET. Only patients who had undergone a lobar pulmonary resection were subsequently considered; these patients had a new complete cardio-respiratory evaluation 3 months after surgery. The pre- and postoperative values compared were those of FEV1, <e>TLC</e>, DLCO, VO2max, and VE/VCO2. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). Statistic evaluation was made using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: During this period 11 patients completed the study protocol. Ten patients underwent surgery for NSCLC and one for a pulmonary aspergilloma. Nine lobectomies and two bilobectomies were performed. In the study population, the preoperative mean value of FEV1 resulted as being 53% (SD+/-20) of the predicted mean value, that of TLC 120% (SD+/-35) and that of DLCO 65% (SD+/-27). The preoperative mean value of VO2max resulted as being 17.8 ml/Kg/min (SD+/-3.25) and mean VE/VCO2 resulted as being 35.7 (SD+/-4). Three months after surgery the measured mean value of FEV1 was 53% (SD+/-18), that of TLC was 99% (SD+/-24) and that of DLCO 52% (SD+/-18). The mean value of VO2max resulted as being 14.1 ml/Kg/min (SD+/-3.04) and that of VE/VCO2 was 42.5 (SD+/-12.8). Statistical analysis of PFT values showed that FEV1 and DLCO were not significantly modified (P &gt; 0.05); in contrast, TLC had significantly decreased (P = 0.008). VO2max had significantly decreased (P = 0.004) and VE/VCO2 had significantly increased (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Three months after a lobar pulmonary resection, patients with COPD were found to have a significant decrease in exercise tolerance. PFT alone can underestimate the postoperative loss of exercise capacity through exercise.",M1
16134729,"Pulmonary function and high-resolution CT findings five years after disease onset in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.OBJECTIVE: Although pulmonary involvement is common in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), little is known about the pulmonary outcome. We evaluated the relationship between clinical disease characteristics and pulmonary function and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings after disease duration of 5 years. METHODS: A pulmonary function test (PFT) and pulmonary HRCT were performed in 41 patients from a population-based register of WG. Clinical predictors for abnormal PFT and HRCT were tested by logistic regression. RESULTS: Previous WG-related lung involvement (PLI) had occurred in 80% of patients, but only 24% of patients still reported pulmonary symptoms at the research visit. One-third of patients had abnormal PFT findings, with reduced alveolar diffusion by KCO (transfer coefficient) being most common (24%). The number of PLI episodes was associated with reduced KCO and reduced FEV1% (forced expiratory volume in 1 s as a percentage of forced vital capacity) (overall presence 10%). Reduced KCO was also associated with disease duration. Reduced total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) (overall presence 8%) was only related to prior WG-related lung nodules. Pulmonary HRCT was abnormal in 80%, but with more severe abnormalities in only 30%. Pleural thickening and parenchymal bands were associated with PLI. None of the treatment variables was associated with the PFT or HRCT findings. CONCLUSION: Five years after disease onset a quarter of the WG patients reported pulmonary symptoms, had severe abnormalities on HRCT, and abnormal PFT. The correlation between these abnormalities was poor, but the number of pulmonary involvements was a risk factor for reduced gas diffusion, obstructive lung disease, parenchymal bands, and pleural thickening. Treatment variables had no discernible negative pulmonary effects.",M1
16079599,"Morphometric deformations of small airways and alveoli under quasi-static inflation process.Localized morphometric deformations of small airways and alveoli during respiration have many biomedical and physiological implications. We developed fast synchrotron radiation CT system to visualize the small airways and alveoli of an intact mouse lung without fixation and dehydration, and analyzed their localized morphometric deformations between functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). In the diameter behavior, the averaged and range values were significantly larger for smaller airways (68.8%, range: 0.36-0.89) than larger airways (45.2%, range: 0.40-0.57). These results indicated that the airway did not deformed in same manner and that these morphological differences characterized the heterogeneous lung function.",M1
16009600,"Effect of lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema on diaphragm function.Preoperative prediction of a successful outcome following lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) for emphysema is imperfect. One mechanism could be improvement in respiratory muscle function yet controversy exists regarding the magnitude and mechanism of such an improvement. Therefore, we measured diaphragm strength in 18 patients before and after LVRS. Mean (S.D.) FRC fell from 6.53 to 5.40 l (p = 0.0001). Mean sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure increased from 76 to 87 cm H2O (14%, p &lt; 0.03) and mean twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Tw Pdi) increased by 2.5 cm H2O at 3 months (12%, p = 0.03). There was a highly significant increase in twitch esophageal pressure (Tw Pes) (60%, p &lt; 0.0001), which was maintained at 12 months (46% increase, p = 0.0004). No change was observed in quadriceps twitch tension in nine subjects in whom it was measured. After LVRS the ratio Tw Pes:Tw Pdi increased from 0.24 to 0.37 at 3 months (p = 0.0003) and 0.36 at 12 months (p = 008). Low values of Sn Pdi, Sn Pes, Tw Pes and a high RV/<e>TLC</e> ratio were the preoperative variables most predictive of improvement in shuttle walking distance. We conclude that LVRS improves diaphragm function primarily by alteration of lung volume. Patients with poor diaphragm function and high RV/TLC ratio preoperatively are most likely to benefit from the procedure.",M1
15990001,"Differences in pulmonary function before vs. 1 year after hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for small peripheral lung tumors.PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term pulmonary toxicity of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) performed before and after SRT for small peripheral lung tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 17 lesions in 15 patients with small peripheral lung tumors, who underwent SRT between February 2000 and April 2003, were included in this study. Twelve patients had primary lung cancer, and 3 patients had metastatic lung cancer. Primary lung cancer was T1-2N0M0 in all cases. Smoking history was assessed by the Brinkman index (number of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by number of years of smoking). Prescribed radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 40-60 Gy in 5-8 fractions. PFTs were performed immediately before SRT and 1 year after SRT. Test parameters included total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). PFT changes were evaluated in relation to patient- and treatment-related factors, including age, the Brinkman index, internal target volume, the percentages of lung volume irradiated with &gt;15, 20, 25, and 30 Gy (V15, V20, V25, and V30, respectively), and mean lung dose. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in TLC, VC, or FEV1.0 before vs. after SRT. The mean percent change from baseline in DLCO was significantly increased by 128.2%. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a correlation between DLCO and the Brinkman index. CONCLUSIONS: One year after SRT as compared with before SRT, there were no declines in TLC, VC, and FEV1.0. DLCO improved in patients who had been heavy smokers before SRT, suggesting a correlation between DLCO and smoking cessation. SRT seems to be tolerable in view of long-term lung function.",M1
15970093,"[Changes in pulmonary function in severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during convalescent period]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes and pattern of pulmonary function in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients during convalescent period. METHODS: Pulmonary function tests were performed in 26 SARS convalescent patients regularly every 3 months after their discharge from hospital. The significance of changes in pulmonary function indexes was analyzed. RESULTS: Restrictive pulmonary ventilation function and diffusing dysfunction of the lung were found in one third of the patients during third to sixth month from onset. There was a little improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV(1.0)), functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) as convalescent period was prolonged, but no difference was found between different stages (3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months, 12-15 months and 15-17 months). Meanwhile, the FEV(1.0)/FVC showed no significant change. However, there was an obvious improvement in total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with the elapse of time, and also a significant difference was found between the later stage and the earlier stage. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary dysfunction is found among some SARS patients after convalescence presenting mainly as restrictive ventilatory function and diffusing capacity abnormality. These dysfunctions would improve gradually with the elapse of time.",M1
15946833,"Pattern of diffusion disturbance related to clinical diagnosis: The K(CO) has no diagnostic value next to the DL(CO).AIM OF THE STUDY: The diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) is an important tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pulmonary diseases. In case of a decreased DL(CO) the K(CO), defined as DL(CO)/V(A) (V(A) is alveolar volume), can differentiate between normal alveolocapillary membrane (normal K(CO)) and abnormal alveolocapillary membrane (low K(CO)). The latter category consists of decreased surface of the membrane, increased thickness or decreased perfusion of ventilated alveoli. The V(A)/<e>TLC</e> (TLC is total lung capacity determined by whole body plethysmography) can partially differentiate between these categories. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of the specific diffusion disturbances, which can be constructed by combining the DL(CO), K(CO) and V(A)/TLC. METHODS: In 460 patients the diagnosis made by clinicians were fitted into five diagnostic categories: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), treatment effects of haematologic malignancies, heart failure and diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). These categories were linked to the pattern of diffusion disturbance. RESULTS: Almost all patients with asthma have a normal DL(CO), most patients in the other groups do not have the expected pattern of diffusion disturbance, especially in the group with DPLD a bad match is observed. CONCLUSION: In this study the pattern of diffusion disturbance is of limited use in establishing a diagnosis. The use of the K(CO) next to the DL(CO) has no additional diagnostic value. Regional ventilation-perfusion inequality probably forms an important underlying mechanism of decreased DL(CO).",M1
15926160,"Pulmonary function abnormalities in children treated with whole lung irradiation.BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the prevalence of abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in a cohort of children who had received whole lung irradiation (WLI) for treatment of metastatic disease. PROCEDURE: This was a retrospective (1988-2003) chart review that included all children treated at our institution with WLI who had undergone PFT. Data abstracted included oncologic diagnosis, radiation dose and fractionation, spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25%-75%), plethysmography (<e>TLC</e>, FRC, RV, RV/TLC), diffusing capacity (DLCO), and respiratory muscle strength (MIP, MEP). PFTs were normalized according to standard deviation (Z) scores. RESULTS: Thirty patients were identified who had one or more PFT. The incidence of mild, moderate, or severe reductions in FEV1 was 30%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, with 50% having normal FEV1. Seventeen percent of patients had mild reduction in total lung capacity (TLC), while 13% and 30% had moderate or severe reductions. Thirty-eight percent had mild reductions in diffusing capacity, while 29% and 14% had moderate or severe reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function abnormalities were common in this cohort of children treated with WLI, and may be progressive in nature. Further studies are warranted to identify patients at highest risk.",M1
15766905,"Measurement of neural respiratory drive in patients with COPD.Assessment of neural respiratory drive may be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for diverse clinical and academic reasons. We hypothesised that the oesophageal diaphragm EMG during CO2 rebreathing and treadmill exercise could be used for this purpose. The oesophageal catheter consisted of nine consecutive recording electrode coils, which formed five pairs of electrodes with an inter-electrode distance 3.2 cm within a recording pair. Each coil was 1cm in length and the gap between adjacent coils was 0.5 mm. Maximal isometric contractions at functional residual capacity (FRC) and maximal voluntary inspirations from FRC to total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were performed. All subjects performed CO2 rebreathing until end-tidal CO2 was approximately 9% or they became intolerably breathless. There was a good linear relationship between peak of root mean square (RMS) of the diaphragm EMG and end-tidal CO2 (r = 0.92 +/- 0.06) during CO2 rebreathing. The method was also shown to be feasible during exercise. It is concluded that the diaphragm EMG recorded from an oesophageal electrode is a useful technique to assess neural respiratory drive in patients with COPD.",M1
15704183,"Long-term pulmonary morbidity in survivors of congenital diaphragmatic hernia.Our objective was to study long-term respiratory outcomes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) treated in the perinatal period. This was a cohort study with 26 adolescent survivors and age- and gender-matched controls. Medical histories were retrieved from hospital charts and questionnaires. Pulmonary function testing included measurement of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIPS and MEPS) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). Unpaired two-tailed t-test and nonlinear regression were used for statistical analysis. Significant differences were found in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) (79% +/- 16% vs. 94% +/- 10%, P &lt; 0.001), FEF(25-75) (62% +/- 24% vs. 84% +/- 15%, P &lt; 0.001), FRC (114% +/- 20% vs. 95% +/- 13%, P &lt; 0.001), RV/<e>TLC</e> (31% +/- 10% vs. 22% +/- 6%, P &lt; 0.001), MVV (74% +/- 16% vs. 90% +/- 13%, P &lt; 0.001), and MIPS (69% +/- 19% vs. 84% +/- 16%, P &lt; 0.01), with numbers indicating percent predicted of reference values +/- SD. Reduction of MVV was not independent from FEV1 (r = 0.83). Forty-eight percent of patients vs. 4% of controls showed significant improvement of FEV1 after bronchodilators (86% +/- 15 vs. 98% +/- 10, P &lt; 0.01). Forty-six percent of patients had abnormalities of the chest wall or spinal column such as pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, and scoliosis, mostly mild or moderate. In conclusion, long-term respiratory outcome in adolescent CDH is associated with mild to moderate airway obstruction, a high prevalence of response to bronchodilators, and decreased inspiratory muscle strength. This should guide follow-up scheduling and should be taken into account for perioperative and critical care management.",M1
15659083,"Assessment of lung volumes in children and adolescents: comparison of two plethysmographic techniques.Thoracic gas volume (Vtg) can be measured with body plethysmography by either repetitive panting or one single inspiratory effort against a shutter occluding the airways. The panting technique is preferred, but may be demanding. We aimed to assess the precision of these two methods and the degree of agreement between them. Vtg and functional residual capacity (FRC) were measured in 155 subjects with a standard, commercially available plethysmograph, acting as a variable-pressure, constant-volume device when Vtg is determined. Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and residual lung volume (RV) were calculated subsequent to a full vital capacity manoeuvre. For non-asthmatic healthy subjects, the standard deviations (SD) of the differences between two replicate measurements of FRC, TLC and RV were respectively 0.16, 0.13 and 0.14 litres with the panting technique, and 0.18, 0.18 and 0.23 litres with the single inspiratory effort technique. In percentage of the respective lung volumes, the corresponding 1.96 SDs were 20%, 8% and 40% with the panting technique and 23%, 12% and 67% with the single inspiratory effort technique. Between the two techniques, 95% limits of agreement were 21% for FRC, 11% for TLC and 58% for RV. The variability of Vtg and FRC accounted for most of the variability of TLC and RV. In conclusion, the panting and the single inspiratory effort technique produced results that were comparable in magnitude, however with a better precision with the panting technique. The single inspiratory effort technique can be used as an alternative if the panting technique fails.",M1
15640366,"Lung development and susceptibility to ventilator-induced lung injury.RATIONALE: Ventilator-induced lung injury has been predominantly studied in adults. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of age and lung development on susceptibility to such injury. METHODS: Ex vivo isolated nonperfused rat lungs (infant, juvenile, and adult) were mechanically ventilated where VT was based on milliliters per kilogram of body weight or as a percentage of the measured total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). In vivo anesthetized rats (infant, adult) were mechanically ventilated with pressure-limited VTs. Allocation to ventilation strategy was randomized. MEASUREMENTS: Ex vivo injury was assessed by pressure-volume analysis, reduction in TLC, and histology, and in vivo injury by lung compliance, cytokine production, and wet- to dry-weight ratio. MAIN RESULTS: Ex vivo ventilation (VT 30 ml.kg(-1)) resulted in a significant reduction (36.0 +/- 10.1%, p &lt; 0.05) in TLC in adult but not in infant lungs. Ex vivo ventilation (VT 50% TLC) resulted in a significant reduction in TLC in both adult (27.8 +/- 2.8%) and infant (10.6 +/- 7.0%) lungs, but more so in the adult lungs (p &lt; 0.05); these changes were paralleled by histology and pressure-volume characteristics. After high stretch in vivo ventilation, adult but not infant rats developed lung injury (total lung compliance, wet/dry ratio, tumor necrosis factor alpha). Surface video microscopy demonstrated greater heterogeneity of alveolar distension in ex vivo adult versus infant lungs. CONCLUSION: These data provide ex vivo and in vivo evidence that comparable ventilator settings are significantly more injurious in the adult than infant rat lung, probably reflecting differences in intrinsic susceptibility or inflation pattern.",M1
15596685,"Validity of the American Thoracic Society and other spirometric algorithms using FVC and forced expiratory volume at 6 s for predicting a reduced total lung capacity.OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare the performance of three spirometric algorithms developed to predict whether the total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) is reduced vs normal or increased, (2) to determine if forced expiratory volume at 6 s (FEV(6)) can be substituted for FVC in these algorithms, and (3) to determine if ascertainment bias was present in patients referred for the measurement of spirometry and TLC compared to patients referred for spirometry only. METHODS: We analyzed the results of 219 consenting consecutive patients referred to a New Zealand tertiary hospital respiratory laboratory for spirometry and TLC measurements. Spirometry results from 370 patients referred for spirometry but not lung volumes were used to test for potential ascertainment bias. Spirometry results were analyzed using the lower limit of normal (LLN) values from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Study reference equations. The equations of Goldman and Becklake, and Crapo were used to classify TLC as normal or abnormal. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to produce an algorithm using the LLN for FVC and FEV(6). The performances of previous algorithms and our own algorithms were analyzed for predicting a reduced lung volume against the  gold standard,  plethysmographic TLC. RESULTS: All three algorithms predicted a reduced TLC with an accuracy of approximately 50%. In contrast, all algorithms predicted TLC was either normal or increased with an accuracy of &gt; or = 99% regardless of the reference set used. The algorithms based on FEV(6) performed equally as well as the FVC algorithms. No ascertainment bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that spirometry-based algorithms can accurately predict when TLC is either normal or increased, and can also increase the a priori probability that TLC is reduced to approximately 50%. FEV(6) is equivalent to FVC in these predictions.",M1
15591470,"Inspiratory-to-total lung capacity ratio predicts mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Static lung hyperinflation has important clinical consequences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We analyzed the power of lung hyperinflation as measured by the inspiratory capacity-to-total lung capacity ratio (IC/<e>TLC</e>) to predict mortality in a cohort of 689 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (95% males; FEV(1), 1.17 L) with a mean follow-up of 34 months. We also compared the predictive value of IC/TLC with that of the BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, exercise performance) Index. Subjects who died (183; 27%) were older; had lower body mass index, FEV(1), and IC/TLC ratio; walked less in the 6-minute walking distance; and had more dyspnea, a higher BODE Index, and comorbidity (p &lt; 0.001). On the basis of logistic regression analysis, IC/TLC was found to be a good and independent predictor of all-cause and respiratory mortality. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic Type II curves, IC/TLC compared favorably with FEV(1) and predicted mortality independently of the BODE Index. We conclude that IC/TLC is an independent risk factor for mortality in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We propose that this ratio be considered in the assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",M1
15486375,"Risk factors for near-fatal asthma.BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of lung function data in patients, both before and after episodes of near-fatal asthma (NFA), requiring transient endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Lung function was initially measured in 43 asthmatic patients (age range, 16 to 49 years), who were observed and treated in a tertiary referral asthma clinic and were clinically stable at the time of study. Subsequently, clinical and physiologic follow-up studies were obtained over &gt; 5 years. The primary outcomes were to determine (1) the integrity of lung elastic recoil and (2) the severity of expiratory airflow limitation, and (3) to correlate these outcomes with adverse clinical complications. RESULTS: Fourteen of 26 asthmatic patients (54%) [age range, 30 to 49 years] had significantly reduced lung elastic recoil pressures at all lung volumes compared to 3 of 17 asthmatic patients (18%); p = 0.02 [chi(2) test and Fisher exact test] [age range, 16 to 26 years]. In asthmatic patients between the ages of 30 and 49 years, significant loss of lung elastic recoil was noted in 4 of 10 patients with mild reduction in FEV(1) (FEV(1), &gt; 79% predicted), 6 of 12 patients with moderate reduction in FEV(1) (FEV(1), 61 to 79% predicted), and all 4 patients with severe reduction in FEV(1) (FEV(1), &lt; 61% predicted). In asthmatic patients between the ages of 16 and 26 years, significant loss of lung elastic recoil was noted in 0 of 11 patients with mild reduction in FEV(1), 2 of 5 patients with moderate reduction in FEV(1), and 1 of 1 patient with severe reduction in FEV(1). A subgroup of 10 asthmatic patients (7 men) [mean (+/- SD) age, 37 +/- 11 years] were studied when clinically stable, both before and after an episode of NFA in 8 cases and only after an episode of NFA in 2 additional cases. In 1 of 10 cases, the FEV(1) was mildly reduced, in 4 cases it was moderately reduced, and in 5 cases it was severely reduced, both before and after an episode of NFA. The sensitivity was 90%, the specificity was 61%, the positive predictive value was 41%, and the negative predictive value was 95% for NFA with an FEV(1) &lt; or = 79% predicted or FEV(1)/FVC ratio of &lt; 75%. Prior to an episode of NFA, all 8 asthmatic patients had significant loss of lung elastic recoil pressure, and afterward all 10 had significant loss of lung elastic recoil pressure (ie, less than the predicted normal mean minus 1.64 SD at a total lung capacity [<e>TLC</e>] of 100 to 70% predicted). The sensitivity was 100%, the specificity was 79%, the positive predictive value was 59%, and the negative predictive value was 100% for NFA with the loss of lung elastic recoil. The mean TLC measured with a plethysmograph in 10 patients with NFA was 7.2 +/- 1.41 (124 +/- 16% predicted). The sensitivity for TLC of &gt; 115% predicted was 70%, the specificity was 70%, the positive predictive value was 88%, and the negative predictive value was 41% for NFA. CONCLUSION: A persistent reduction in FEV(1) of &lt; or = 79% predicted or an FEV(1)/FVC ratio of &lt; 75%, and, especially, the loss of lung elastic recoil and hyperinflation at TLC are risk factors for NFA. The loss of lung elastic recoil in asthmatic patients was associated with increased age, duration of disease, and progressive expiratory airflow limitation.",M1
15382842,"A comparison of two methods for measuring airway distensibility: nitrogen washout and the forced oscillation technique.The measurement of airway stiffness is an important tool for studying airway remodelling in asthma. The relationship between airway calibre and lung volume (airway distensibility) was measured by forced oscillation technique (FOT) and compared with that measured by single-breath nitrogen washout (SBNW). In four non-asthmatic healthy subjects and three asthmatics, anatomical dead space (VDF) was measured by SBNW and respiratory system conductance (Grs) was measured by FOT at 6 Hz. During SBNW testing, 0.51 oxygen boluses were inhaled from three different lung volumes: functional residual capacity (FRC), 11 above FRC and near total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). Following inhalation of the oxygen bolus subjects exhaled to residual volume and then inhaled to TLC. During FOT, subjects breathed 0.5-1.01 tidal volumes but with gradually increasing end-expiratory lung volume until close to TLC, then returned to normal breathing before inhaling to TLC. This was also repeated but with reducing lung volume from TLC. Absolute lung volumes were measured by body plethysmography and related to volumes during FOT and SBNW by reference to TLC obtained at the end of each SBNW or FOT test manoeuvre. Distensibility was calculated as the linear regression slopes of VDF or Grs versus lung volume. Distensibility measured by VDF ranged 16-37 ml 1(-1) lung volume and by Grs it ranged 0.06-0.19 1 s(-1) cmH2O(-1) 1(-1) lung volume. Both distensibility measurements were correlated (Pearson's R2 = 0.91, p = 0.001). The SBNW and FOT are comparable methods for measuring airway distensibility and may have similar clinical usefulness. However, further studies are required to make any specific inferences about the relationship between airway distensibility by FOT and airway remodelling.",M1
15316211,"Value of spirometry in detecting volume restriction in interstitial lung disease patients. Spirometry in interstitial lung diseases.BACKGROUND: Restriction is a typical functional abnormality in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, but is not always present, especially in the early stage of the disease. The greater reduction of vital capacity (VC; %pred.) than total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>; %pred.) is regarded as a typical pattern of lung function disturbances in ILD patients. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To explore the diagnostic value of spirometry in a detection restrictive pattern the relative volume loss assessed by TLC and VC in large series of patients with a diagnosis of ILD referred for lung function tests was evaluated. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of pulmonary function data was done. The sampleconsisted of 1,173 patients with the diagnosis of different interstitial lung diseases investigated during a period of 5 years. Only patients without airway obstruction (normal FEV1%VC) were included. In all cases spirometry and whole body plethysmography were performed by experienced staff using MasterLab - 'Jaeger' equipment according to ERS standards. Reference values according to ERS guidelines were applied. RESULTS: The mean value of TLC expressed as %pred. was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower than VC in all patients (93.7 +/- 18.6 vs. 98.0 +/- 21.4%pred.). The frequency of abnormal (lowered) TLC results was also higher than lowered VC (22.8 vs. 17.8%). Sensitivity of VC reached 69.3% and the positive predictive value was 88.5% in detecting volume restriction as compared to TLC measurement. CONCLUSION: The relative loss of TLC was greater than VC in our large group of patients. Measurement of TLC should be part of functional assessment of ILD patients, irrespective of whether they present or do not present a restrictive pattern in spirometry.",M1
15302725,"Inspiratory muscle training improves lung function and exercise capacity in adults with cystic fibrosis.STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on inspiratory muscle function (IMF), diaphragm thickness, lung function, physical work capacity (PWC), and psychosocial status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Twenty-nine adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to three groups. Two groups were required to complete an 8-week program of IMT in which the training intensity was set at either 80% of maximal effort (group 1; 9 patients) or 20% of maximal effort (group 2; 10 patients). A third group of patients did not participate in any form of training and acted as a control group (group 3; 10 patients). INTERVENTIONS: In all patients, baseline and postintervention measures of IMF were determined by maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax), and sustained Pimax (SPimax); pulmonary function, body composition, and physical activity status were also determined. In addition, diaphragm thickness was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) [TDIcont], and the diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) was calculated (TR = thickness during Pimax at FRC/mean thickness at FRC). Subjects also completed an incremental cycle ergometer test to exhaustion and two symptom-related questionnaires, prior to and following training. RESULTS: Following training, significant increases in Pimax and SPimax (p &lt; 0.05), TDIcont (p &lt; 0.05), TR (p &lt; 0.05), vital capacity (p &lt; 0.05), TLC (p &lt; 0.05), and PWC (p &lt; 0.05) were identified, and decreases in anxiety scores (p &lt; 0.05) and depression scores (p &lt; 0.01) were noted in group 1 patients compared to group 3 patients. Group 2 patients significantly improved Pimax and SPimax (both p &lt; 0.05) only with respect to group 3 patients. No significant differences were observed in group 3 patients. CONCLUSION: An 8-week program of high-intensity IMT resulted in significant benefits for CF patients, which included increased IMF and thickness of the diaphragm (during contraction), improved lung volumes, increased PWC, and improved psychosocial status.",M1
15058163,"Peak expiratory flow in children and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.Spirometric and plethysmographic examinations were performed in two groups of children with idiopathic scoliosis and healthy children. Group I, 23--children with scoliosis 1 degree by Cobb, spinal curvature 17.2 degree, 12 girls and 11 boys at the age 8-15 years (the mean age was 11.4 +/- 2.4 yr). In Group II were 35 children, 28 girls and 7 boys at the age 12-19 years (the mean age was 14.67 +/- 1.47 yr) with mean angle of curvature 63.35 degree, which is grade II and III scoliosis according to Cobb. The Control Group were 20 children, 13 girls and 7 boys at the age of 8-16 years (the mean age was 13.77 +/- 1.72 yr). The measurements were done using Body--plethysmography with pneumotachograph Jaeger. All subjects had respiratory function examination performed, which included: total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1), residual volume (RV) and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV). At the same time peak expiratory flow--PEF were determined. In children with scoliosis at initial stage, Group I, were found slightly decreased total lung capacity--TLC and statistically significantly decreased intrathoracic gas volume--ITGV as well as residual volume--RV in comparison to the control group. Forced vital capacity--FVC and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec.--FEV1 were normal. But statistically significantly decreased PEF values were found in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). It means that restrictive and obstructive disturbances of lungs progressing in grade II and III scoliosis were shown manifested by reduced values of TLC, FVC, ITGV and RV. A statistically significant decrease of peak expiratory flow together with the growth of spinal curvature angle was shown in grade II and III scoliosis in comparison with both the control group and the studied Group I (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05).",M1
15008764,"Respiratory function in pregnancy at sea level and at high altitude.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of pregnancy on respiratory function in a non-Caucasian group and determine whether there was an interaction between pregnancy and altitude of residence. DESIGN: Prospective cross sectional study. SETTING: Antenatal clinics in Peru, at sea level in Lima and at high altitude in Cerro de Pasco. SAMPLE: Peruvian women with singleton pregnancies; 122 living at sea level and 192 living at 4300 m altitude in the Peruvian Andes. At each location, 19 non-pregnant women were also studied. METHODS: Respiratory function was measured in pregnant and non-pregnant women living at sea level and at 4300 m. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), expiratory residual volume (ERV) and functional residual capacity (FRC). RESULTS: At sea level, RV and TLC were higher in the third compared with the first trimester (P &lt; 0.05). At high altitude, FEV1 (P &lt; 0.01), ERV (P &lt; 0.01) and FRC (P &lt; 0.01) were lower in the third compared with the first trimester. Pregnant and non-pregnant women at high altitude were 4 cm shorter (P &lt; 0.0001) and had larger lung volumes (P &lt; 0.01); their total lung capacities were approximately 1 L greater than women living at sea level (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the effect of pregnancy on the respiratory function of healthy women is influenced by altitude of residence.",M1
14769748,"Lung volume reduction surgery in canine model of predominantly upper lobe emphysema: advantages of new surgical system.OBJECTIVE: Lung volume reduction surgery has been shown to be an effective treatment for selected patients with advanced emphysema. Nevertheless, prolonged air leaks are a significant complication that limits the utility of this procedure. This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a novel surgical system designed to minimize this complication. METHODS: In 14 dogs, severe upper lobe emphysema was produced by repeated bronchial instillations of papain administered over an approximate 6-month interval. Pulmonary function testing that included lung volumes and flows was performed at baseline, after emphysema, and at 1 month and 6 months after resection in the surgical group, while at comparable intervals in the nonsurgical group. Seven animals were randomly assigned to a surgical group to test a vacuum-assisted surgical system (VALR Surgical System; Spiration; Redmond, WA) that deploys a compression silicone sleeve over portions of the diseased tissue. The other seven dogs comprised the nonsurgical group. RESULTS: In both groups, emphysema increased total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) approximately 125% as compared to baseline. In the surgical group, no air leaks were observed after resection, and TLC significantly decreased at the 1-month and 6-month periods as compared with postemphysema measurements. At necropsy, histologic examination revealed fibrosis of the compressed lung contained within the sleeve and fibrotic encapsulation of the device. Two animals had evidence of localized infection. CONCLUSION: We successfully created a model of predominantly upper lobe emphysema. The vacuum-assisted surgical system provided safe and effective lung reduction without air leak complications and with sustained improvement in pulmonary function over 6 months.",M1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Academic Children's Hospital. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients with a diagnosis of empyema between 1992-2000. RESULTS: A total of 45 pulmonary function tests were carried out in 36 study participants. Within 3 months of hospital discharge, 91% of pulmonary function tests demonstrated a restrictive pattern with a mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 69.2 +/- 4% and a mean total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) of 74.9 +/- 4% of predicted. The incidence of restriction in pulmonary function significantly decreased over time and for patients tested &gt; 1 year from hospital discharge the mean FVC was 87.1 +/- 2% and the mean TLC 95.0 +/- 2% of predicted. However, 19% of the patients tested &gt; 1 year from discharge demonstrated a mild restrictive pattern and 16% demonstrated a mild obstructive changes. Patients with abnormal lung function &gt; 1 year from hospital discharge did not demonstrate any signs or symptoms of respiratory insufficiency . CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of restrictive patterns in lung function for children tested within 3 months from hospital discharge for empyema. The incidence of restrictive patterns decreased significantly over time and most patients tested &gt;1 year from hospital discharge demonstrated normal lung function.",M1

The results of a four-year prospective study undertaken in two tertiary hospitals in Kuwait are presented. The mean age at diagnosis of the 52 patients studied was 55.40 +/- 11.87 years. Thirty-two (61.5%) patients were male and 22 (42.3%) were smokers. The mean duration of symptoms at diagnosis was 2.1 +/- 0.92 years. Digital clubbing was found in 34 (65%) patients. The mean FVC, <e>TLC</e> and TLCO were 57%, 64.4% and 55% of predicted normal, respectively. The FVC value showed a significant difference between smokers and non-smokers (p &lt; 0.05). HRCT findings were abnormal in all patients. Typical histological and high-resolution computed tomography findings of usual interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonia were observed.

The response to treatment was not encouraging, especially in the usual interstitial pneumonia subtype.",M1
14679484,"Lung function in children with diabetes mellitus.A cross-sectional study design was undertaken to assess pulmonary function in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and to establish if there is any relationship with diabetic factors and complications. Thirty-eight children (10 +/- 1.8 years) with IDDM and without clinical or radiological evidence of lung involvement, and 41 healthy age-matched reference subjects, underwent a pulmonary function study. Thirteen (34%) of 38 subjects with IDDM were studied at the onset of their disease. Adjusted values expressed as SD score of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)), and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) were found to be significantly lower than in controls (-0.54 +/- 0.87 vs. 0.40 +/- 1.10, P = 0.0008; -0.11 +/- 0.96 vs. 0.52 +/- 1.07, P = 0.01; -1.60 +/- 1.07 vs. -0.57 +/- 1.28, P = 0.001, respectively). These differences also existed in the group investigated at onset of diabetes. Residual volume (RV) and RV/total lung capacity ratio (RV/<e>TLC</e>) were significantly higher in the whole group of patients with IDDM than in controls (-0.20 +/- 0.83 vs. -0.80 +/- 0.88, P = 0.003; and 26 +/- 6.2 vs. 21 +/- 5.0, P = 0.0002, respectively). Seventeen patients (45%) had abnormal pulmonary function (SD score, less than -1.64): 16 subjects had reduced TLCO, 4 had reduced FVC, and in 3 of the 17, both functional indices were abnormal. There was no significant relationship between pulmonary function indices and diabetic factors or complications. The only significant association was between abnormal TLCO and females (P = 0.03), suggesting that sex may be a predisposing factor for the development of pulmonary complications. This study supports the view that the lung is functionally involved in children with IDDM early on in the course of the disease.",M1

METHODS: During June 1985 to October 2000, 42 patients with malignant tumor of ovarian germ cells received chemotherapy containing bleomycin in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Twenty three patients (54.76%) among them had &gt;or= 2 courses of chemotherapy with bleomycin and performed &gt;or= 2 measurements of lung function. These 23 patients were included in the study. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) and D(LCO) were measured and recorded as % of predicted. The D(LCO) was corrected by hemoglobin concentration [D(LCO) corrected = D(LCO) measured x (9.38 + Hb) divided by (1.76 x Hb)]. All the data were divided into 4 groups according to the cumulative dose of bleomycin (pre-treatment group, &lt; 100 mg group, 101 - 200 mg group and &gt; 201 mg group). The relationship between D(LCO) and bleomycin cumulative dose was examined by linear regression analysis and t-test. RESULTS: The values of FEV(1%)predicted in the 4 groups were 99.83 +/- 16.41 (14), 101.43 +/- 12.32 (42), 99.41 +/- 10.22 (23), and 90.96 +/- 13.63 (12), respectively. The FVC%predicted were 97.74 +/- 18.23 (14), 101.11 +/- 13.95 (42), 96.49 +/- 12.04 (23) and 89.63 +/- 18.20 (12), respectively.

14605031,"Advantages of the intrabreath technique as a measure of lung function before and after heart transplantation.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary function testing is an integral part of evaluating patients who are being considered for cardiac transplantation. The accurate measurement of diffusing capacity (DLCO) and alveolar volume (VA) is dependent on a 10-s breath-holding maneuver that may be difficult for patients with congestive heart failure to perform. The intrabreath (IB) technique is not dependent on a breath-holding maneuver and may provide more accurate pulmonary function testing results in chronically debilitated patients. METHODS: Seventy-five patients performed maneuvers with IB and single-breath (SB) techniques during evaluation for heart transplantation and at 3 and 12 months following transplantation. The DLCO, VA, and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) were compared using Pearson correlation coefficients, a Student t test, and intercorrelation coefficients. RESULTS: The DLCO and VA, when determined with the IB technique, had excellent correlations to the SB technique over all ranges of DLCO values. VA values that were determined by the IB technique were greater than those determined by the SB technique and more closely approximated the TLC values. The satisfactory correlation between the two techniques was maintained when DLCO was corrected for VA. However, due to the lower values for VA as determined by the SB method, the corrected measurements were consistently higher for the SB technique. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function can be measured accurately in a population of patients with long-standing congestive heart failure, both before and after cardiac transplantation, using the IB technique. Furthermore, the IB technique may provide a more accurate measurement of VA.",M1
14571697,"Postoperative changes on pulmonary function after laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy.BACKGROUND/AIMS: We examined 28 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for acute or chronic cholecystitis and/or cholelithiasis in order to evaluate the effect of surgical technique on respiratory functional parameters. METHODOLOGY: We compared lung volume, flow parameters and blood gas indices in two groups of patients, eighteen of which underwent laparoscopic and ten of which open cholecystectomy, specifically on the 2nd and 8th postoperative day lung function indices were compared to preoperative values. The same anesthetic protocol was administered for all patients. No underlying illness other than the cholecystitis and/or cholelithiasis was present. RESULTS: From the results of lung volume parameters, ERV (%pred) data indicate a better expiratory ability for the Open Cholecystectomy [preop.: 93.10 (38.80), 8th day: 116.90 (63.69) compared to the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy group (preop.: 105.39 (31.51), 8th day: 98.72 (35.80). For IC (%pred.) parameter, in the Open Cholecystectomy group a marked but not statistically significant decrease remained into the 8th day (preop.: 86.70 (16.40). 8th day: 68.40 (16.98)] whereas for the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy group, IC %pred value reflected a better respiratory performance [preop.: 92.83 (17.87), 8th day: 82.50 (18.82)]. For RV and RV/<e>TLC</e> parameter measurements a marked increase in the %pred value was observed for the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy group on the 8th postoperative day as compared to preoperative data [RV: 122.94 (42.80), 109.22 (33.23) respectively, RV/TLC: 122.68 (31.10), 109.14 (21.56) respectively]. From the analysis of the flow parameters, a distinct difference was evident for PEF between the preoperative and 8th postoperative day data with the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy group showing statistically significant better flow rates [preop.: 93.72 (15.91), 8th day: 84.33 (20.67)] as compared to the Open Cholecystectomy group [preop.: 82.30 (22.98), 8th day: 59.10 (15.23)]. CONCLUSIONS: Having compared the 8th postoperative day with preoperative data for the two surgical methods, open cholecystectomy presented a better expiratory performance as compared to the laparoscopic method. However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy resulted in an overall better postoperative respiratory function.",M1
14512671,"Effects of training on the tolerance to high-intensity exercise in patients with severe COPD.BACKGROUND: There has been no systemic investigation of the effects of training on endurance at different high-intensity work rates in patients with COPD to date. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine the effects of intense endurance training on tolerance to several high-intensity work rates and to establish the relationship between power (WR) and its tolerable duration (t) (t = W'/(WR - CP), being W', the curvature constant, thought to be reflective of anaerobic energy availability and/or tolerance to the uncomfortable sensations associated with the high-intensity exercise, and CP the critical power. METHODS: We studied 27 patients: age 62 +/- 5 years; FEV(1) 1.2 +/- 0.2 liters. Before and after the intervention, the subjects randomly underwent 4 high-intensity constant WR exercise tests. The endurance times of the highest 3 tests were used. RESULTS: Ventilation reached approximately the same level in each of the tests. In response to the training, the average peak increased by 9 +/- 5% (p &lt; 0.0001), CP by 14 +/- 12% (p &lt; 0.0001) and W' 18 +/- 22% (p = 0.002). In 67% of the patients, CP increased, accompanied by changes in other related physiological variables of aerobic capacity. In the remaining 33%, W' increased but not CP. Smaller or no changes in the other variables of aerobic capacity were found in those subjects. This latter group was significantly older and had more hyperinflation (i.e. higher RV/<e>TLC</e>%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neither an incremental nor a single endurance test at constant WR provides an adequate characterisation of exercise tolerance at other WRs. CP and W' appear to be important parameters characterizing exercise tolerance over a range high-intensity work rates and identifying two distinct types of response to training.",M1
12911832,"A novel approach for quality control of total lung capacity in the clinical pulmonary function laboratory: a study in a veteran population.OBJECTIVE: Quality control in the clinical pulmonary function laboratory has been well developed for spirometry and diffusing capacity but not for the measurement of <e>TLC</e>. The purpose of the present study was to test two approaches to this problem. First, we compared TLC by body plethysmography (TLCb) with a value predicted from TLC measured by multibreath helium dilution (TLCm). Concordance between the measured and predicted values would imply the validity of the measurements. Second, we measured the test-retest variability of TLCb, TLCm and TLC measured by single breath helium dilution (TLCs) to assess the consistency of the measurements. METHODOLOGY: We performed a prospective study of 815 veterans. RESULTS: The prediction of TLCb from TLCm improved (r2 increased from 0.44 to 0.64) when FEV1/FVC and the difference between TLCm and TLCs were added to the model. The coefficient of variation for test-retest of TLCs, TLCm and TLCb were 8.9, 7.1 and 5.4%, respectively. Of all tests, 5.9% were inconsistent based on pathophysiology or measurement error and attributed mostly to TLCm. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of TLCb from TLCm was not sufficiently accurate as to be useful for quality control. Comparison of TLCs, TLCm and TLCb may be useful for determining the internal data validity.",M1
12777404,"Tracking of airway and tissue mechanics during <e>TLC</e> maneuvers in mice.A tracking impedance estimation technique was developed to follow the changes in total respiratory impedance (Zrs) during slow total lung capacity maneuvers in six anesthetized and mechanically ventilated BALB/c mice. Zrs was measured with the wave-tube technique and pseudorandom forced oscillations at nine frequencies between 4 and 38 Hz during inflation from a transrespiratory pressure of 0-20 cmH2O and subsequent deflation, each lasting for approximately 20 s. Zrs was averaged for 0.125 s and fitted by a model featuring airway resistance (Raw) and inertance, and tissue damping and elastance (H). Lower airway conductance (Glaw) was linearly related to volume above functional residual capacity (V) between 0 and 75-95% maximum V, with a mean slope of dGlaw/dV = 13.6 +/- 4.6 cmH2O-1. s-1. The interdependence of Raw and H was characterized by two distinct and closely linear relationships for the low- and high-volume regions, separated at approximately 40% maximum V. Comparison of Raw with the highest-frequency resistance of the total respiratory system revealed a marked volume-dependent contribution of tissue resistance to total respiratory system resistance, resulting in the overestimation of Raw by 19 +/- 8 and 163 +/- 40% at functional residual capacity and total lung capacity, respectively, whereas the lowest frequency reactance was proportional to H; these findings indicate that single-frequency resistance values may become inappropriate as surrogates of Raw when tissue impedance is changing.",M1
12765312,"Duration of deep inspiration and subsequent airway constriction in vivo.The effects of a deep inspiration (DI) in asthmatics differ from those observed in healthy subjects. When considering the effects of a DI, an implicit assumption is that all the airways are distending at the same rate as the lung parenchyma. However, with such rapid lung inflation, the ability of contracted airways to dynamically follow the lung parenchyma was recently shown to significantly lag the lung inflation. Another potentially important variable in the response of the individual airways to a DI that has not been well studied is the duration of the DI maneuver. The current study examines the effects of increasing duration at <e>TLC</e> during a DI on subsequent airway caliber. In five anesthetized and ventilated mongrel dogs, after DIs of increasing duration, changes in airway size were measured over the subsequent 5-minute period using high-resolution computed tomography. Results show that the duration of the maneuver is extremely important, leading to a qualitative change in the airway response. A long DI (&gt; or = 30 seconds) caused subsequent airway dilation, while a shorter DI (&lt; 30 seconds) caused bronchoconstriction. The precise mechanism underlying these observations is uncertain but seems to be related to intrinsic properties within the contracted airway smooth muscle.",M1
12764637,"On visual determination of full inspiration on CT images.The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of experienced thoracic radiologists to assess full inspiration based on two CT slices, one above and one below the carina, in normal subjects. Ten healthy volunteers were studied. Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) was measured with a body plethysmograph. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in two slices at TLC and at various expired volumes. Mean Hounsfield values (HU) were calculated. Unidentifiable images, stored on a web server, were analysed visually by experienced thoracic radiologists. The results show that the mean lung density at TLC varied by approximately 40 HU between individuals. Within an individual this may correspond to a decrease in lung volume of approximately 25% of TLC. On visual determination of images taken at 65-74% of TLC, more than one-third of the images were assessed as taken at full inspiration; of the images taken at 75-84% of TLC, approximately 50% were assessed as taken at full inspiration. We conclude that visual determination of full inspiration on CT images in normal subjects is highly inaccurate. If quantitative density measurements are to be used in the diagnosis or follow-up of lung disease, thorough control of full inspiration is recommended.",M1
12694829,"Effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on lung function in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of chemoradiation on objective tests of pulmonary function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred lung cancer patients treated in five protocols between 1992 and 2000 with combinations of thoracic radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy were evaluated with pre- and post-RT pulmonary function tests. The pulmonary function tests were analyzed for changes in measures of obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 s per unit of vital capacity [FEV(1)/VC]), restriction (total lung capacity [<e>TLC</e>]), and diffusing capacity (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]). The use and timing of chemotherapy and RT, as well as patient, tumor, and treatment factors, were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: No treatment or patient factors were significantly associated with changes in FEV(1)/VC. Chemotherapy with RT, compared with RT alone, was associated with a lower post-RT TLC (92% vs. 107%, p = 0.002). Nodal status (N2-N3 vs. N1), tumor location (central vs. peripheral), use of &gt;/=6 treatment fields, and tumor volume &gt;/=100 cm(3) were also associated with a significantly lower post-RT TLC. On univariate analysis, the use of any chemotherapy (p = 0.029) and the use of concurrent vs. sequential chemotherapy (p = 0.028) were predictive of a lower post-RT DLCO. Patient age &gt;/=60 years, nodal status (N2-N3 vs. N0-N1), tumor volume &gt;/=100 cm(3), tumor location (central vs. peripheral), and use of &gt;/=6 treatment fields were also associated with a significantly lower post-RT DLCO. The fractional volume of irradiated normal lung correlated with the decrease in DLCO (p &lt;0.001), with a 1.3% DLCO decline for each 1% of total lung volume that received &gt;20 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of chemotherapy to RT significantly exacerbates the post-RT decrease in TLC and DLCO. The greatest decrease in DLCO occurs in patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation.",M1
12627308,"Maximal dynamic expiratory pressures with fast and slow inspirations.Maximal dynamic expiratory pressures are higher when forced expiration is preceded by a fast inspiration to total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) than when preceded by a slow inspiration and a few seconds pause at TLC. We hypothesized that these pressure differences are due to the stretch-shorten cycle (SSC), which refers to enhancement of muscle force when a concentric muscle contraction is immediately preceded by an eccentric contraction. Seven volunteers [36 (2) years; mean (SEM)] performed maximal forced expirations against minimal resistance with fast (F) or slow (S) maneuvers. F maneuvers consisted of a fast inspiration to TLC followed immediately by a fast expiration, whereas S consisted of a slow inspiration to TLC and a 4- to 5-s pause at TLC prior to forced expiration. We measured esophageal pressure ( P(es)), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and the EMG activity of the transversus abdominis (Tr) by means of intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. The subjects performed several runs of each maneuver in a random order, and runs with the greatest expiratory P(es) were analyzed. In comparison with S, F yielded greater P(es) [182 (15) versus 167 (15) cm H(2)O; P=0.003)] but similar PEFR [9.8 (0.7) versus 9.6 (0.7) l/s, P&gt;0.05] and EMG activity of the Tr during forced expiration [221 (31) versus 208 (34) a.u., P&gt;0.05]. Further analysis revealed significant EMG activity of Tr during end-inspiration (eccentric contraction) with F maneuvers only [73 (22) versus 32 (17) a.u., P&lt;0.05]. We conclude that the ability of expiratory muscles to generate greater P(es) with F maneuvers is related to the sequence of an eccentric contraction, which is followed immediately by concentric contraction in a manner analogous to SSC described in skeletal muscles.",M1
12529942,"[Hypodynamic respiratory insufficiency. Diagnostic investigation]Patients with restrictive lung disease, owing to respiratory muscle dysfunction, have no parenchymal involvement. Their vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) are reduced to less than 50% and can lead to pneumonia and nocturnal hypercapnia and hypoxia. Their diffusion capacity is normal. With maximal static mouth pressure (Pimax) &lt; 80 cm H2O and/or Pemax &lt; 100 cm H2O, patients are referred to the national centres. Here, inspiratory muscular insufficiency is confirmed by sniff nasal inspiratory pressure and oesophageal pressure &lt; 70 cm H2O. Expiratory muscular insufficiency is confirmed by a cough peak flow &lt; 3-4 L/sec. and cough gastric pressure &lt; 100 cm H2O. Sleep studies reveal nocturnal hypoventilation. Phrenic nerve stimulation is to be introduced in the diagnostic approach. Twitch mouth or oesophageal pressure &lt; 10 cm H2O and twitch gastric pressure &lt; 7 cm H2O are pathognomonic for neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency.",M1
12503698,"Size matching in lung transplantation using predicted total lung capacity.Height is used in allocation of donor lungs as an indirect estimate of thoracic size. Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>), determined by both height and sex, could be a more accurate functional estimation of thoracic size. Size-matching criteria based on height versus predicted TLC was retrospectively evaluated, and, furthermore, whether a TLC mismatch was related to clinical and functional complications. The ratio of donor and recipient height, as well as the ratio of predicted TLC in donors and recipients, were calculated in 80 patients after bilateral lung transplantation. Complications evaluated included persistent atelectasis, persistent pneumothorax and increased number of days in intensive care, occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and limitation of exercise capacity. Median height donor/recipient ratio was 1.01 (0.93-1.12). Median predicted TLC donor/recipient ratio was 1.01 (with a clearly broader range 0.72-1.41). Neither sex mismatch nor TLC mismatch were related to clinical or functional complications. Allocation of donor lungs based upon height alone leads to a substantial mismatch in total lung capacity caused by sex mismatch. The absence of complications suggests that a greater height donor/recipient discrepancy can be accepted for allocation than previously assumed.",M1
12453203,"Does lung growth occur when mature lobes are transplanted into children?Lung volume increases after living donor lobar lung transplantation (LD) in children. The mechanism responsible for this increase may be alveolarization (lung growth) or alveolar dilation. The diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide adjusted for lung volume (DLco/VA) should decrease if alveolar dilation occurs, but not if lung growth occurs. Pulmonary function tests were measured 1-12 months after transplant in 20 children receiving LD transplants and in 11 children receiving cadaveric whole lung transplantation (CL). One month after transplant there were no differences between LD and CL recipients in age, gender, or height. Compared to the first month after transplant, height increased at 6-12 months after LD (p &lt; 0.05), and only at 12 months after CL (p = 0.02). Total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>) showed an 11-22% increase at 3-12 months after LD, and an 11-14% increase at 6-12 months after CL. DLco/VA showed an 11-17% decrease at 3-12 months after LD. However, in recipients of CL, DLco/VA showed a transient decrease of 10% at 3-6 months post-transplant, but was not significantly lower at 9-12 months. LD recipients had lower DLco/VA values than CL recipients at 6-12 months after transplant (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that following LD, lung volume increases, but DLco/VA decreases. We speculate that alveolar dilation, rather than alveolarization, is the primary mechanism of increased lung volume in children following LD.",M1
12391064,"Physiological characterization of variability in response to lung volume reduction surgery.This paper examines potential physiological mechanisms responsible for improvement after lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). In 25 patients (63 +/- 9 yr; 11 men, 14 women), spirometry [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC)], lung volumes [residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>)], small airway resistance, recoil pressures, and respiratory muscle contractility (RMC) were measured before and 4-6 mo after LVRS. Data were interpreted to assess how changes in each component of lung mechanics affect overall function. Among responders (DeltaFEV(1) &gt; or = 12%; 150 ml), improvement was primarily due to an increase in FVC, not to FEV(1)-to-FVC ratio. Among nonresponders, FEV(1), FVC, and RV/TLC did not change after surgery, although recoil pressure increased in both groups. Both groups experienced a reduction in RMC after LVRS. In conclusion, LVRS improves function in emphysema by resizing the lung relative to the chest wall by reducing RV. LVRS does not change airway resistance but decreases RMC, which attenuates the potential benefits of LVRS that are generated by reducing RV/TLC. Among nonresponders, recoil pressure increased out of proportion to reduced volume, such that no increase in vital capacity or improvement in FEV(1) occurred.",M1
12377866,"Grading the severity of obstruction in the presence of a restrictive ventilatory defect.STUDY OBJECTIVES: No recommendation currently exists for grading the severity of airway obstruction in the presence of additional restriction. The grading of airway obstruction is currently based on the FEV(1) (American Thoracic Society [ATS] recommendations), while prior recommendations by the Intermountain Thoracic Society (ITS) graded the severity of obstruction based on the FEV(1)/FVC ratio. The objective was to compare the grading of airway obstruction using the percent predicted FEV(1) (ATS) with a confidence interval-based system (ITS), with particular focus on pulmonary functions in patients having both airway obstructions and restrictions. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: A retrospective analysis of 21,499 patient pulmonary function tests (PFTs) was performed. The predicted values of Crapo and coworkers were used. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The distribution of the severity of the obstruction was compared using the ATS and ITS methods for PFTs with normal, increased, or decreased total lung capacity (<e>TLC</e>). Analysis was performed using the chi(2) method. Of the 21,499 PFTs that were analyzed, TLC was measured in 28% (5,962 PFTs). In this cohort, 44% (2,619 PFTs) gave evidence of obstruction. Of these, 147 PFTs demonstrated additional restriction. While the ATS criteria graded 133 of these PFTs (90%) as being severe, the ITS criteria graded only 4 PFTs (3%) as severe (the severity distribution between the methods was significantly different [p &lt; 0.01]). CONCLUSIONS: In view of the possible overestimation of the severity of obstruction in PFTs with concurrent restriction using the percentage of predicted FEV(1) values, consideration should be given to grading the severity of obstruction on the basis of the FEV(1)/FVC ratio in this specific subset of PFTs.",M1
20499628,"Hypoglycaemic and amylase inhibitory activities of leaves of Spondias mombin Linn.Suppressing the production of glucose by inhibiting a-amylase / a-glucosidase activity is one of the therapeutic approaches for decreasing postprandial hyperglycaemia and a strategy for evaluating antidiabetic activity. We investigated leaves of Spondias mombin because our previous ethnobotanical survey showed that it is used by traditional healers to manage diabetes in South West Nigeria. We report a bioactivity-guided study of S. mombin using glucose loading (1 g/kg) alloxan-induced diabetic rats and inhibition of a-amylase as basis for isolation of active constituents. Hyperglycaemia was induced in albino rats and blood glucose levels monitored for 180 mins using a glucometer. Powdered leaves were macerated with 80% Methanol. The active extract was fractionated on column chromatography packed with silica gel G6OA eluting with gradient mixtures of pet. ether and ethylacetate. The most active a-amylase inhibiting fraction was purified on thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) and pure compound identified by spectroscopy. Peak decrease in blood glucose of 41.4% (p &lt; 0.05) was recorded after 60 mins. This activity-guided study produced an active TLC band (69.8% amylase inhibition, p &lt; 0.05) from which a-sitosterol was characterized as the main inhibitor. This is first report of hypoglycaemic and amylase inhibitory activities of S. mombin. The role of phytosterols in control of diabetes mellitus is discussed. This study justifies the ethnopharmacological use of this species in recipes for management of diabetes mellitus.",M2
20480903,"Detection of methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine in spiked plasma by HPLC and <e>TLC</e>.HPLC and TLC methods were developed for separation and detection of some amphetamine analogs: methamphetamine (MA); 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,  ecstasy ); and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA) in spiked plasma samples. The methods are based on purple chromogens formed by displacement reaction of these secondary aliphatic amine-bearing drugs with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane at 80 degrees C for 25 min. For HPLC, both normal phase (silica gel) and RP (C18) columns were used. With the former, good detection limits in plasma were obtained with a 6 min run: 70, 100, and 500 ng/mL for MDMA, MA, and MDEA, respectively. For TLC, hexane-chloroform (1 + 9) and benzene-diethyl ether-petroleum ether (40-60 degrees)-acetonitrile-ethyl methyl ketone (2 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) were used as mobile phases for silica gel 60 TLC and cyano-bonded silica gel HPTLC plates, respectively. The former offered more sensitive results than the latter. Influence of evaporation steps on recovery and interferences for the HPLC and TLC methods were investigated. The developed methods are selective, simple, and easily applicable.",M2
20480894,"Quantification of glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza glabra extract by validated HPTLC densitometry.Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn (Family-Fabaceae) is active as an anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, mild laxative, antistress, antidepressive, antiulcer, liver protective, estrogenic, emmenagogue, and antidiabetic substance, and is widely used in the Indian system of medicine. The major bioactive constituent is glycyrrhizin. A simple HPTLC method has been developed to control the quality of raw as well as finished glycyrrhiza using glycyrrhizin as the bioactive marker. The solvent system was optimized to chloroform-methanol-water (65 + 36 + 7.5, v/v/v). Extract and standard were dissolved in 70% methanol and applied on a precoated <e>TLC</e> plate. After development, the plate was scanned at 254 nm to create a chromatogram, then the quantity of glycyrrhizin was determined in the extract. The method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision, LOD, and LOQ. Linearity range was found to be 0.96-4.80 microg per spot. The linearity relationship was described by the equation: Y = 612.706 + 1.091X (with r = 0.99904 and SD = 2.52%), where Y is the area under curve and X is the amount of glycyrrhizin (ng). The amount of glycyrrhizin found in the extract was 9.1%. Thus, the method provides a rapid and cost-effective quality measure for Glycyrrhiza glabra hydroalcoholic extract.",M2
20439409,"Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay.When a transient or stable transfection assay is developed for a promoter, a primary objective is to quantify promoter strength. Because transfection efficiency in such assays can be low, promoters are commonly fused to heterologous reporter genes that encode enzymes that can be quantified using highly sensitive assays. The reporter protein's activity or fluorescence within a transfected cell population is approximately proportional to the steady-state mRNA level. In this protocol, cells transfected with an Escherichia coli transposon chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid are lysed by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing and cellular debris is removed by centrifugation. The lysate is incubated with [(14)C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-coenzyme A; CAT catalyzes the acetylation of chloramphenicol. The acetylated products and the unmodified reactants are separated from the aqueous solution by organic extraction with ethyl acetate. Acetylation is monitored by autoradiography following thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) to separate the acetylated from the unacetylated forms. The percent conversion of [(14)C]chloramphenicol to acetyl-[(14)C]chloramphenicol can be measured by PhosphorImager analysis of the TLC plate, by excising the radioactive spots from the TLC plate and counting in a scintillation counter, or by densitometry analysis of an autoradiograph. The acetylated (14)C-labeled product can also be quantified without TLC by organic extraction and scintillation counting using reagent-grade chemicals.",M2
20392153,"Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis by novel antifungal compounds targeting C-14 reductase.The limited number of clinically available antifungal drugs for life-threatening fungal infections has produced an increased demand for new agents. In the course of our screening for novel antifungals, we identified aminopiperidine derivatives which exhibit antifungal activities against the major pathogenic yeasts. Thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) analysis of the extracted non-saponifiable lipids from Candida albicans showed that these compounds inhibited the ergosterol production in the late step of the synthesis pathway. The results of an LC/Q-Tof MS analysis showed that abnormal sterols including predicted ignosterol, which is known to be accumulated in C. albicans ERG24 deleted mutant, were accumulated in C. albicans treated with one of these derivatives (Compound 1b). Furthermore, the partial disruption of the cell membrane of C. albicans treated with compound 1b was observed by electron microscopy analysis, suggesting its inhibition of ergosterol synthesis. Additionally, a genetic approach demonstrated that ERG24 gene would be responsible for the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae against Compound 1b, strongly indicating that the enzyme targeted by Compound 1b is Erg24p. From all these data, we concluded that these aminopiperidine derivatives are novel antifungal compounds inhibiting C-14 reduction in the ergosterol synthesis pathway.",M2
20391602,"Direct analysis of Salvia divinorum leaves for salvinorin A by thin layer chromatography and desorption electrospray ionization multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry.Salvia divinorum is widely cultivated in the US, Mexico, Central and South America and Europe and is consumed for its ability to produce hallucinogenic effects similar to those of other scheduled hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD. Salvinorin A (SA), a kappa opiod receptor agonist and psychoactive constituent, is found primarily in the leaves and to a lesser extent in the stems of the plant. Herein, the analysis of intact S. divinorum leaves for SA and of acetone extracts separated using thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) is demonstrated using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry. The detection of SA using DESI in the positive ion mode is characterized by several ions associated with the compound - [M+H](+), [M+NH(4)](+), [M+Na](+), [2M+NH(4)](+), and [2M+Na](+). Confirmation of the identity of these ions is provided through exact mass measurements using a time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometer. The presence of SA in the leaves was confirmed by multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (MS(n)) of the [M+H](+) ion using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Direct analysis of the leaves revealed several species of salvinorin in addition to SA as confirmed by MS(n), including salvinorin B, C, D/E, and divinatorin B. Further, the results from DESI imaging of a TLC separation of a commercial leaf extract and an acetone extract of S. divinorum leaves were in concordance with the TLC/DESI-MS results of an authentic salvinorin A standard. The present study provides an example of both the direct analysis of intact plant materials for screening illicit substances and the coupling of TLC and DESI-MS as a simple method for the examination of natural products.",M2
20355211,"Validated stability-indicating <e>TLC</e> method for the determination of noscapine.A sensitive, selective, precise and stability-indicating thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) method was developed and validated for the analysis of noscapine, both as a bulk drug and in its formulation. The method employed TLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60F-254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consisted of chloroform-methanol (10:0.5 v/v). Densitometric analysis of noscapine and its degradation products was carried out in the absorbance mode at 254 nm. This system was found to give compact symmetrical spots for noscapine (R(f) value 0.85 +/- 0.04). Noscapine was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation and photo degradation. The drug undergoes photo degradation and also degrades under acidic and basic conditions. The prepared degradation products were identified and verified through infrared (IR) and mass spectral analyses. The degraded products were also well resolved from the pure drug with significantly different R(f) values and they were quantitatively determined. The method was validated for linearity, precision, robustness, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), specificity and accuracy. Linearity was found to be in the 1.0-10.0 microg, 0.4-3.2 microg, 1.0-9.0 microg and 0.5-5.0 microg/band ranges for noscapine, cotarnine, meconine and opionic acid, respectively. The polynomial regression analysis for the calibration plots showed a good polynomial relationship with r(2) of 0.9998, 9989, 9996 and 0.9997 for noscapine and its three degradation products, cotarnine, meconine and opionic acid, respectively. Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable and specific for the estimation of noscapine. As this approach could effectively separate the drug from its degradation products it can be employed as a stability-indicating method in Quality Control laboratories.",M2
20333764,"Vertical sandwich-type continuous/evaporative <e>TLC</e> with fixed mobile phase volume for separating sugars of clinical relevance in paper-borne urine and blood samples in newborn screening.We describe the history and current implementation of an inexpensive thin layer chromatography (TLC) method, vertical sandwich-type continuous/evaporative TLC with fixed mobile phase volume, that is convenient for detecting and identifying reducing sugars of clinical relevance in the paper-borne blood and urine samples collected in neonatal screening programmes. This method facilitates screening by providing a considerable degree of standardization of chromatographic results. Among some 555,000 newborns to which it has been applied, it has detected 10 cases of classical galactosaemia, 7 cases of galactokinase deficiency, 2 cases of glucosuria, and 3 cases of transitory neonatal diabetes mellitus; the only false negatives we are aware of were two cases of galacto-4-epimerase deficiency detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Screening for sugars in urine has allowed the detection of galactosaemia when the accompanying blood sample was invalid because of transfusion or parenteral feeding. The conclusion is that this inexpensive procedure is very useful for the detection of relevant metabolopathies in circumstances where others fail.",M2

Theses oils have shown commercial importance as cocoa-butter substitutes because of their high symmetrical triglycerides content. The conventional thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>), gas chromatography (GC) &amp; gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) techniques were used to characterize the components and the high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique was used to quantify the each group of components. The experimental data showed that the all the three oils are rich in sterol content and among all the sterols, beta-sitosterol occupies the highest amount. Sal oil contains appreciable amount of cardenolides, gitoxigenin. Tocopherol is present only in mahua oil and oleyl alcohol is present in mango kernel oil. Hydrocarbon, squalene, is present in all the three oils. The characterization of these minor components will help to detect the presence of the particular oil in specific formulations and to assess its stability as well as nutritional quality of the specific oil.",M2
20213676,"Application of thin-layer chromatography/infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry to structural analysis of bacteria-binding glycosphingolipids selected by affinity detection.Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play key roles in the manifestation of infectious diseases as attachment sites for pathogens. The thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) overlay assay represents one of the most powerful approaches for the detection of GSL receptors of microorganisms. Here we report on the direct structural characterization of microbial GSL receptors by employment of the TLC overlay assay combined with infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS). The procedure includes TLC separation of GSL mixtures, overlay of the chromatogram with GSL-specific bacteria, detection of bound microbes with primary antibodies against bacterial surface proteins and appropriate alkaline phosphatase labeled secondary antibodies, and in situ MS analysis of bacteria-specific GSL receptors. The combined method works on microgram scale of GSL mixtures and is advantageous in that it omits laborious and time-consuming GSL extraction from the silica gel layer. This technique was successfully applied to the compositional analysis of globo-series neutral GSLs recognized by P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteria, which were used as model microorganisms for infection of the human urinary tract. Thus, direct TLC/IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS adds a novel facet to this fast and sensitive method offering a wide range of applications for the investigation of carbohydrate-specific pathogens involved in human infectious diseases.",M2

20190686,"Global DNA methylation changes in blood of patients with essential hypertension.BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common disease of the cardiovascular system and one of the main causes of mortality in the world. Its etiopathogenesis and molecular mechanisms are unknown. Epigenetic changes may play a role in its development. Therefore the level of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a well-known epigenetic marker, was analyzed in DNA from the blood of essential hypertension patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: <e>TLC</e> chromatographic analysis of the DNA nucleotide composition was used to determine 5mC levels in blood DNA samples from 60 patients suffering from essential hypertension (30 with stage 1 and 30 with stage 2 hypertension) and 30 control subjects. RESULTS: The mean levels of 5mC were 1.80 + or - 0.69 in the healthy subjects, 1.14 + or - 0.48 in all the patients with essential hypertension, 1.29 + or - 0.50 in those with stage 1, and 0.99 + or - 0.42 in those with stage 2 of hypertension. Statistically significant differences in 5mC amount in DNA were observed between the control group and the whole patient group, the control group and each subgroup of patients, and the groups of patients with stage 1 and stage 2 of hypertension. The level of 5mC in the DNA of the essential hypertension patients was independent of clinical and biochemical factors. CONCLUSIONS: The level of 5mC in the DNA of patients suffering from essential hypertension is lower than in healthy people and depends of the progression of hypertension.",M2
20162410,"Simultaneous HPLC analysis of ceramide and dihydroceramide in human hairs.Ceramide, a major class of hair lipid, can help determine the physicochemical properties of human hairs such as the chemical diffusion barrier and water retention. In this study, we developed a quantitation method for ceramide and dihydroceramide, a saturated form of ceramide, in human hairs. Lipids were extracted with ethanol from human hairs spiked with N-oleoyl-D-erythro-C(17) sphingosine, an internal standard. Ceramide and dihydroceramide were resolved by <e>TLC</e> and deacylated by sphingolipid-ceramide deacylase to release sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine, respectively. The hair content of ceramide was measured by HPLC following derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde. The limits of detection and quantification for ceramide extracted from hair fibers were 0.1 and 1 pmol, respectively. The linear range of hair weight for determining ceramide and dihydroceramide contents was 1 to 50 mg, with R(2) values of 0.9695 and 0.9898, respectively. The recoveries of ceramide and dihydroceramide from intra-day and interday assays were 99.55% to 98.53%, respectively. Concentrations of dihydroceramide from the hair roots to distal tip ends ranged from 10.42 +/- 2.19 to 1.20 +/- 0.11 nmol/g hair, while those of ceramide ranged from 2.27 +/- 0.22 to 1.47 +/- 0.15 nmol/g hair. The present analytical method provides a simultaneous and reproducible quantification of ceramide and dihydroceramide, and may be used as a potential biomarker for lipid abnormality-related diseases.",M2
20149188,"Structural characterization of alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout pig heart and kidney glycolipids and their reactivity with human and baboon antibodies.BACKGROUND: alpha1,3-galactosyltranferase knockout (GalT-KO) pigs have been established to avoid hyperacute rejection in GalT-KO pig-to-human xenotransplantation. GalT-KO pig heart and kidney glycolipids were studied focusing on elimination of Gal-antigens and whether novel antigens would appear. Non-human primates are used as pre-clinical transplantation experimental models. Therefore, sera from baboons transplanted with GalT-KO hearts were compared with human serum regarding reactivity with pig glycolipids. METHODS: Neutral and acidic glycolipids were isolated from GalT-KO and WT pig hearts and kidneys. Glycolipid immune reactivity was tested on <e>TLC</e> plates using human affinity-purified anti-Gal Ig, anti-blood group monoclonal antibodies, lectins, and human serum as well as baboon serum collected before and after GalT-KO pig heart transplantations. Selected glycolipid fractions, isolated by HPLC, were structurally characterized by mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: GalT-KO heart and kidney lacked alpha3Gal-terminated glycolipids completely. Levels of uncapped N-acetyllactosamine precursor compounds, blood group H type 2 core chain compounds, the P1 antigen and the x(2) antigen were increased. Human serum antibodies reacted with Gal-antigens and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) in WT organs of which only the NeuGc reactivity remained in the GalT-KO tissues. A clear difference in reactivity between baboon and human antibodies with pig glycolipids was found. This was most pronounced for acidic, not yet identified, compounds in GalT-KO organs which were less abundant or lacking in the corresponding WT tissues. CONCLUSIONS: GalT-KO pig heart and kidney completely lacked Gal glycolipid antigens whilst glycolipids synthesized by competing pathways were increased. Baboon and human serum antibodies showed a different reactivity pattern to pig glycolipid antigens indicating that non-human primates have limitations as a human pre-clinical model for immune rejection studies.",M2
20120015,"32P-postlabeling analysis of DNA adducts formed by leukotriene A4 (LTA4).Leukotriene A(4) (LTA(4)), a reactive electrophilic intermediate formed during the biosynthesis of inflammation-related lipid mediators, has been found to bind covalently to DNA. The major DNA adducts formed by LTA(4) in vitro and human cells have been identified by mass spectrometry on the nucleoside level. Here we investigated whether the thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) (32)P-postlabeling method is suitable for the detection of LTA(4)-DNA adducts. The reaction of individual deoxynucleoside 3'-monophosphates with LTA(4) in aqueous basic solution yielded numerous adduct spots when analyzed by the two enrichment procedures of the (32)P-postlabeling method-nuclease P1 digestion and butanol extraction. Highest LTA(4)-adduct levels were found with deoxyguanosine 3'-phosphate (around one adduct per 10(4) normal nucleotides). Under similar reaction conditions LTA(4) (25-320 microM) was incubated with calf thymus DNA, then DNA adduct patterns and levels were determined with the TLC (32)P-postlabeling method using both enrichment versions. The same DNA adduct pattern consisting of up to seven spots was observed with both enrichment versions. DNA adduct formation by LTA(4) was concentration-dependent with major adducts being derived from deoxyguanosine. When a human monocytic cell line (Mono Mac 6) was stimulated with arachidonic acid and calcium ionophore LTA(4)-DNA adducts were detected by (32)P-postlabeling. However, the level of these endogenously formed DNA adducts was close to the detection limit (3 +/- 2 adducts per 10(8) normal nucleotides). In summary, the TLC (32)P-postlabeling method is suitable for studying DNA adduct formation by LTA(4) and can be used for further investigations on the link between inflammation and cancer.",M2
20118373,"Alkaloid cluster gene ccsA of the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea encodes chanoclavine I synthase, a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing oxidoreductase mediating the transformation of N-methyl-dimethylallyltryptophan to chanoclavine I.Ergot alkaloids are indole-derived secondary metabolites synthesized by the phytopathogenic ascomycete Claviceps purpurea. In wild-type strains, they are exclusively produced in the sclerotium, a hibernation structure; for biotechnological applications, submerse production strains have been generated by mutagenesis. It was shown previously that the enzymes specific for alkaloid biosynthesis are encoded by a gene cluster of 68.5 kb. This ergot alkaloid cluster consists of 14 genes coregulated and expressed under alkaloid-producing conditions. Although the role of some of the cluster genes in alkaloid biosynthesis could be confirmed by a targeted knockout approach, further functional analyses are needed, especially concerning the early pathway-specific steps up to the production of clavine alkaloids. Therefore, the gene ccsA, originally named easE and preliminarily annotated as coding for a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing oxidoreductase, was deleted in the C. purpurea strain P1, which is able to synthesize ergot alkaloids in axenic culture. Five independent knockout mutants were analyzed with regard to alkaloid-producing capability. Thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>), ultrapressure liquid chromatography (UPLC), and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses revealed accumulation of N-methyl-dimethylallyltryptophan (Me-DMAT) and traces of dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT), the first pathway-specific intermediate. Since other alkaloid intermediates could not be detected, we conclude that deletion of ccsA led to a block in alkaloid biosynthesis beyond Me-DMAT formation. Complementation with a ccsA/gfp fusion construct restored alkaloid biosynthesis. These data indicate that ccsA encodes the chanoclavine I synthase or a component thereof catalyzing the conversion of N-methyl-dimethylallyltryptophan to chanoclavine I.",M2
20097155,"Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chlorophyll a with hydrogen peroxide: characterization of the products and mechanism of the reaction.Horseradish peroxidase was verified to catalyze, without any phenol, the hydrogen peroxide oxidation of chlorophyll a (Chl a), solubilized with Triton X-100. The 13(2)(S) and 13(2)(R) diastereomers of 13(2)-hydroxyChl a were characterized as major oxidation products (ca. 60%) by <e>TLC</e> on sucrose, UV-vis, (1)H, and (13)C NMR spectra, as well as fast-atom bombardment MS. A minor amount of the 15(2)-methyl, 17(3)-phytyl ester of Mg-unstable chlorin was identified on the basis of its UV-vis spectrum and reactivity with diazomethane, which converted it to the 13(1),15(2)-dimethyl, 17(3)-phytyl ester of Mg-purpurin 7. The side products (ca. 10%) were suggested to include the 17(3)-phytyl ester of Mg-purpurin 18, which is known to form easily from the Mg-unstable chlorin. The side products also included two red components with UV-vis spectral features resembling those of pure Chl a enolate anion. Hence, the two red components were assigned to the enolate anions of Chl a and pheophytin a or, alternatively, two different complexes of the Chl a enolate ion with Triton X-100. All the above products characterized by us are included in our published free-radical allomerization mechanism of Chl a, i.e. oxidation by ground-state dioxygen. The HRP clearly accelerated the allomerization process, but it did not produce bilins, that is, open-chain tetrapyrroles, the formation of which would require oxygenolysis of the chlorin macrocycle. In this regard, our results are in discrepancy with the claim by several researchers that 'bilirubin-like compounds' are formed in the HRP-catalyzed oxidation of Chl a. Inspection of the likely reactions that occurred on the distal side of the heme in the active centre of HRP provided a reasonable explanation for the observed catalytic effect of the HRP on the allomerization of Chl. In the active centre of HRP, the imidazole nitrogen of His-42 was considered to play a crucial role in the C-13(2) deprotonation of Chl a, which resulted in the Chl a enolate ion resonance hybrid. The Chl enolate was then oxidized to the Chl 13(2)-radical while the HRP Compound I was reduced to Compound II. The same reactive Chl derivatives, i.e. the Chl enolate anion and the Chl 13(2)-radical, which are produced twice in the HRP reaction cycle, happen to be the crucial intermediates in the initial stages of the Chl allomerization mechanism.",M2
20075636,"Inhibitory effect of aged-petroleum hydrocarbons on the survival of inoculated microorganism in a crude-oil contaminated site.We studied the effects of aged total petroleum hydrocarbons (aged TPH) on the survival of allochthonous diesel-degrading Rhodococcus sp. strain YS-7 in both laboratory and field investigations. The aged TPH extracted from a crude oil-contaminated site were fractionized by thin-layer chromatography/flame ionization detection (<e>TLC</e>/FID). The three fractions identified were saturated aliphatic (SA), aromatic hydrocarbon (AH), and asphaltene-resin (AR). The ratio and composition of the separated fractions in the aged TPH were quite different from the crude-oil fractions. In the aged TPH, the SA and AH fractions were reduced and the AR fraction was dramatically increased compared to crude oil. The SA and AH fractions (2 mg/L each) of the aged TPH inhibited the growth of strain YS-7. Unexpectedly, the AR fraction had no effect on the survival of strain YS-7. However, crude oil (1,000 mg/L) did not inhibit the growth of strain YS-7. When strain YS-7 was inoculated into an aged crude oil-contaminated field and its presence was monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we discovered that it had disappeared on 36 days after the inoculation. For the first time, this study has demonstrated that the SA and AH fractions in aged TPH are more toxic to an allochthonous diesel-degrading strain than the AR fraction.",M2
20074739,"Different approaches of impregnation for resolution of enantiomers of atenolol, propranolol and salbutamol using Cu(II)-L-amino acid complexes for ligand exchange on commercial thin layer chromatographic plates.Atenolol and propranolol (the beta-blocking agents) and salbutamol (broncho- and vasodilator) were resolved into their enantiomers by adopting different modes of loading/impregnating the Cu(II) complexes of L-proline (L-Pro), L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), L-histidine (L-His), N,N-dimethyl-L-phenylalanine (N,N-Me(2)-L-Phe), and L-tryptophan (L-Trp) on commercial precoated normal phase plates. The three different approaches were (A) using the Cu(II)-L-amino acid complex as chiral mobile phase additive, (B) ascending development of plain commercial plates in the solutions of Cu complex, and (C) using a solution of Cu(II) acetate as mobile phase additive for the commercial <e>TLC</e> plates impregnated with ascending development of plates in the solutions of amino acid. Spots were located using iodine vapour.

20072930,"Antioxidant activity of biotransformed sex hormones facilitated by Bacillus stearothermophilus.Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from Kuwaiti desert, when incubated with exogenous progesterone for 10 days at 65 degrees C produced two monohydroxylated, two dihydroxy isomers of progesterone and a B-Seco compound. These metabolites were purified by <e>TLC</e> and HPLC followed by their identification through (1)H, (13)C NMR and other spectroscopic data. Microbial hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol resulted in the production of estrone. The effect of some inducers resulted in the production of two metabolites from 17beta-estradiol one of which was identified as 3,6beta,17beta-trihydroxyestra-1,3,5,14(10)-tetrene and the other metabolite remained unidentified. The transformation products were identified through their spectral data and comparison with reference to compounds. Antioxidant activities of progesterone transformed mixture and purified metabolites of 17beta-estradiol were studied by linoleic acid/beta-carotene assay.

20065619,"[Study on processed senna found in health teas]Sennoside A and B were detected in 21 commercial health tea products surveyed in 2000-2007, but there were 8 products in which the leaves could not be identified as senna because the leaves had become discolored. The results of assay of sennoside levels and <e>TLC</e> chromatograms suggested that processed senna had been used in these products. Next, with reference to tea and health tea manufacturing methods, pharmaceutical senna was roasted or wet-processed experimentally. The results indicated that the discolored leaves contained in commercial health tea were most likely derived from senna leaves. Moreover, sennosides in medicinal doses were detected in some processed senna samples, and were determined to have a cathartic action in mice. Based on morphological confirmation and the results of component analysis, including sennoside, the discolored leaves found in commercial health teas were therefore determined to be senna leaves. There may be possible health risks, including diarrhea.",M2
20061243,"Co-occurrence of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, and zearalenone in cereals and feed, determined by competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thin-layer chromatography.Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium species frequently contaminate crops. For this reason mycotoxins such as aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), fumonisins (FBs), and zearalenone (ZEA) are found in food and feed in a wide range of concentrations, depending on environmental and storage conditions. Consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated food and feed has been associated with acute and chronic poisoning and carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and co-occurrence of AFs (B1+B2+G1+G2), OTA, FBs (B1+B2+B3), and ZEA in 37 samples of cereals and feed randomly collected in 2007 from households of an endemic nephropathy (EN) area in Croatia. The mycotoxins were determined using the competitive direct ELISA test (CD-ELISA) in combination with thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>). The most frequent mycotoxin was ZEA (92%, mean 318.3 microg kg-1), followed by FBs (27%, 3690 microg kg-1), AFs (24.3%, 4.6 microg kg-1), and OTA (16.2%, 9.8 microg kg-1). Levels of AFs, ZEA, and FBs detected by CD-ELISA significantly correlated with the TLC results. However, only one OTA-positive sample was confirmed by TLC due to its high limit of detection. The levels of these mycotoxins were below the permissible limit for animal feed. Twenty-nine percent of cereals were contaminated with FBs, OTA, or ZEA in mass fractions above the permissible limit for humans. Co-occurrence of two toxins varied between 4.2% and 54% and of three between 4.2% and 7.6%. Prolonged co-exposure to AFs, OTA, FBs, and ZEA might increase the risk of various chronic diseases.",M2

20047512,"Quantitative determination of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine by thin-layer chromatography in ecstasy illicit pills in Tehran.3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is the major ingredient of ecstasy illicit pills. It is a hallucinogen, central nervous system stimulant, and serotonergic neurotoxin that strongly releases serotonin from serotonergic nerves terminals. Moreover, it releases norepinephrine and dopamine from nerves terminal, but to a lesser extent than serotonin. Poisoning and even death from abusing MDMA-containing ecstasy illicit pills among abusers is usual. Thus, quantitative determination of MDMA content of ecstasy illicit pills in illicit drug bazaar must be done regularly to find the most high dose ecstasy illicit pills and removing them from illicit drug bazaar. In the present study, MDMA contents of 13 most abundant ecstasy illicit pills were determined by quantitative thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>). Two procedures for quantitative determination of MDMA contents of ecstasy illicit pills by TLC were used: densitometric and so-called 'scraping off' methods. The former was done in a reflection mode at 285 nm and the latter was done by absorbance measurement of eluted scraped off spots. Limit of detection (LOD), considering signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 2, and limit of quantification (LOQ), regarding S/N of 10, of densitometric and scraping off methods were 0.40 microg, 1.20 microg, and 6.87 mug, 20.63 microg, respectively. Repeatabilities (within-laboratory error) of densitometric and scraping off methods were 0.5% and 3.6%, respectively.

Crude oil samples were fractionated and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection (<e>TLC</e>-FID). Relative standard deviation (RSD) values for retention time, peak height and half peak width were less than 5.2% for all classes of compounds, based on nine independent replicates. The crude oil light fraction was further analyzed by GC-MS and the majority of identified compounds were methyl- or hydro-derivatives of long-chain hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds. The external standard method used in the present study can lower detection limits of petroleum hydrocarbon compound classes to 20.0 mg L(-1), and the crude oil concentration in the range of 30 and 35,000 mg L(-1) has a high linear correlation (r(2)&gt;0.97, P&lt;0.05) with peak area.

In the present study, the anti-neoplastic activities of different B. lycium root extracts and the major constituting alkaloids, berberine and palmatine were investigated in p53-deficient HL-60 cells. The strongest growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects were found in the n-butanol (BuOH) extract followed by the ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-, and the water (H(2)O) extract. The chemical composition of the BuOH extract was analyzed by <e>TLC</e> and quantified by HPLC. 11.1 microg BuOH extract (that was gained from 1mg dried root) contained 2.0 microg berberine and 0.3 microg/ml palmatine. 1.2 microg/ml berberine inhibited cell proliferation significantly, while 0.5 microg/ml palmatine had no effect. Berberine and the BuOH extract caused accumulation of HL-60 cells in S-phase. This was preceded by a strong activation of Chk2, phosphorylation and degradation of Cdc25A, and the subsequent inactivation of Cdc2 (CDK1). Furthermore, berberine and the extract inhibited the expression of the proto-oncogene cyclin D1. Berberine and the BuOH extract induced the acetylation of alpha-tubulin and this correlated with the induction of apoptosis. The data demonstrate that berberine is a potent anti-neoplastic compound that acts via anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic mechanisms independent of genotoxicity.",M2
19908908,"Structural profiling of individual glycosphingolipids in a single thin-layer chromatogram by multiple sequential immunodetection matched with Direct IR-MALDI-o-TOF mass spectrometry.The thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) immunoenzyme overlay assay is a widely used tool for antibody-mediated identification of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in mixtures. However, because the majority of GSLs is left unexamined in a chromatogram of a single assay, we developed a novel method that permits detection of various GSLs by sequential multiple immunostaining combined with individual coloring of GSLs in the same chromatogram. Specific staining was achieved by means of primary anti-GSL antibodies, directed against lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, and globotetraosylceramide, in conjunction with alkaline phosphatase (AP)- or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies together with the appropriate chromogenic substrates. Triple coloring with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)-AP, Fast Red-AP, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)-HRP resulted in blue, red, and black precipitates, respectively, following three sequential immunostaining rounds. Structures of antibody-detected GSLs were determined by direct coupling of TLC with infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This combinatorial technique was used to demonstrate structural GSL profiling of crude lipid extracts from human hepatocellular cancer. This powerful technology allows efficient structural characterization of GSLs in small tissue samples and marks a further step forward in the emerging field of glycosphingolipidomics.",M2
19908904,"Thin-layer chromatography/laser-induced acoustic desorption/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.The combination of laser-induced acoustic desorption and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LIAD/ESI/MS) can be used to rapidly characterize chemical compounds separated on a thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) plate. We performed LIAD analysis by irradiating the rear side of an aluminum-based TLC plate with a pulsed infrared (IR) laser. To efficiently generate and transfer acoustic and shock waves to ablate the analyte-containing TLC gels, a glass slide was attached to the rear of the TLC plate and the gap between the glass slide and the TLC plate was filled with a viscous solution (glycerol). Although the diameter of the laser spot created on the rear of the TLC plate was approximately 0.35 mm, the ablated areas on the front sides of the silica gel bed and the C(18) reverse-phase gel bed had diameters of approximately 1.3 and 3 mm, respectively. The ablated analyte molecules were ionized in an ESI plume and then detected by an ion trap mass analyzer. This TLC/LIAD/ESI/MS approach allowed the components in mixtures of dye standards, drug standards, and rosemary essential oil to be separated and rapidly characterized.",M2
19899183,"Matrix-free thin-layer chromatography/laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for facile separation and identification of medicinal alkaloids.Quaternary protoberberine alkaloids belong to a pharmaceutically important class of isoquinoline alkaloids associated with bactericidal, fungicidal, insecticidal and antiviral activities. As traditional medicine gains wider acceptance, quick and robust analytical methods for the screening and analysis of plants containing these compounds attract considerable interest. Thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a powerful technique but suffers from dilution of the TLC bands resulting in decreased sensitivity and masking of signals in the low-mass region both due to addition of matrix. This study integrates for the first time conventional silica gel TLC and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) thus eliminating the need for any external matrix. Successful separation of berberine (R(f) = 0.56) and palmatine (R(f) = 0.46) from Berberis barandana including their identification by MS are demonstrated. Furthermore, a robust electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS method utilizing residual sample from TLC for quantification of berberine applying selected reaction monitoring and standard addition method is presented. The amount of berberine in the plant root prepared for the study was determined to be 0.70% (w/w).",M2
19896461,"Arginase activity in mitochondria--An interfering factor in nitric oxide synthase activity assays.Previously, in tightly controlled studies, using three independent, yet complementary techniques, we refuted the claim that a mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) isoform exists within pure, rat liver mitochondria (MT). Of those techniques, the NOS-catalyzed [(14)C]-L-arginine to [(14)C]-L-citrulline conversion assay (NOS assay) with MT samples indicated a weak, radioactive signal that was NOS-independent. Aliquots of samples from the NOS assays were then extracted with acetone, separated by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and exposed to autoradiography. Results obtained from these samples showed no radioactive band for L-citrulline. However, a fast-migrating, diffuse, radioactive band was observed in the <e>TLC</e> lanes loaded with MT samples. In this manuscript, we identify and confirm that this radioactive signal in MT samples is due to the arginase-catalyzed conversion of [(14)C]-L-arginine to [(14)C]-urea. The current results, in addition to reconfirming the absence of NOS activity in rat liver MT, also show the need to include arginase inhibitors in studies using MT samples in order to avoid confounding results when using NOS activity assays.",M2
19894641,"Determination of risperidone in tablets in the presence of its degradation products and placebo-derived constituents.New chromatographic-densitometric assay was developed for identification and determination of risperidone in pharmaceutical formulations. Thin-layer chromatographic plates (<e>TLC</e>-F254) as a stationary phase and n-butanol-acetic acid-water (12:3:5 v/v/v) as a mobile phase were used for separation. Densitometric measurements were done for all constituents at lambda = 280 nm. A decrease in stability of risperidone was observed in acidic, basic and antioxidant solutions. Degradation of active pharmaceutical ingredient was consistent with first-order kinetics and unrelated to the solution. This assay is specific for risperidone. No interference of tablet origin adjuvants and degradation products were observed. Moreover, high sensitivity, limit of detection (0.22 microg/spot), limit of quantitation (0.67 microg/spot), recovery (98.2-100.82%), broad linear range (0.09 microg/spot to 1.40 microg/spot) and accuracy (1.87% RSD) are characteristic traits of the chromatographic-densitometric assay.",M2
19893743,"A novel lipidomic strategy reveals plasma phospholipid signatures associated with respiratory disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients.The aim of this study was to search for lipid signatures in blood plasma from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients using a novel MALDI-TOF-ClinProTools strategy, initially developed for protein analysis, and thin layer chromatography coupled to MALDI-TOF (<e>TLC</e>-MALDI). Samples from 33 CF patients and 18 healthy children were subjected to organic extraction and column chromatography separation of lipid classes. Extracts were analyzed by MALDI-TOF, ion signatures were compared by the ClinProTools software and by parallel statistical analyses. Relevant peaks were identified by LC-MSn. The ensemble of analyses provided 11 and 4 peaks differentially displayed in CF vs healthy and in mild vs severe patients respectively. Ten ions were significantly decreased in all patients, corresponding to 4 lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0, 18:2, 20:3, and 20:5) and 6 phosphatidylcholine (36:5, O-38:0, 38:4, 38:5, 38:6, and P-40:1) species. One sphingolipid, SM(d18:0), was significantly increased in all patients. Four PC forms (36:3, 36:5, 38:5, and 38:6) were consistently downregulated in severe vs mild patients. These observations were confirmed by TLC-MALDI. These results suggest that plasma phospholipid signatures may be able to discriminate mild and severe forms of CF, and show for the first time MALDI-TOF-ClinProTools as a suitable methodology for the search of lipid markers in CF.",M2
19876858,"Delayed onset of seizures and toxicity associated with recreational use of Bromo-dragonFLY.INTRODUCTION: Many countries have specific legislation, such as the Controlled Substances Act (1970) in the United States and the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) in the United Kingdom to control recreational drugs. There is a growing market and supply of  novel  recreational drugs, which include the misuse of pharmaceutical compounds and research chemicals. These are often not covered under current legislation, despite the fact that they often have both similar chemical structures and/or clinical effects to controlled recreational drugs. CASE REPORT: A male patient presented to an emergency department with delayed onset of severe agitation, hallucinations, and tonic-clonic seizures following the use of Bromo-dragonFLY and an unknown white powder. He settled following IV benzodiazepines and supportive care, and was discharged with no evidence of long-term sequelae. Analysis of the white powder by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry (UV/VIS) and thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) showed the presence of Bromo-dragonFLY (1-(8-bromobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']difuran-4-yl)-2-aminopropane); serum analysis by GC/MS and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) confirmed that a combination of Bromo-dragonFLY (0.95 ng/mL), ketamine (20 ng/mL) and cannabis had been used by the patient. No other recreational drugs were detected in an extensive toxicological screen of serum and urine samples. DISCUSSION: This is the first confirmed case to be reported of toxicity with delayed onset of severe agitation, hallucinations and tonic-clonic seizures associated with recreational use of Bromo-dragonFLY (1-(8-bromobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']difuran-4-yl)-2-aminopropane) in combination with ketamine and cannabis. In our view, this case provides further support for the need for a systematic approach to toxicological screening of patients with recreational drug toxicity, to identify emerging drugs and provide evidence for legislative authorities to assist in revising the legal status of emerging recreational drugs.",M2

19822973,"Radiostability of florfenicol in the solid state.The effect of ionizing radiation on florfenicol (FF), an antibiotic with wide antibacterial properties was investigated to determine whether it can be sterilized using high-energy radiation. FF was irradiated by E-beam radiation to doses of 25-800 kGy, and then changes in the physico-chemical properties were examined using chromatographic methods (<e>TLC</e> and HPLC), spectroscopic methods (NMR and MS) and hyphenated methods (HPLC-MS). It was found that a standard sterilizing dose of 25 kGy led to the formation of two new products of radiolysis as well as lowering the content of FF by 0.95%. With higher doses of radiation, the content of FF further decreased (by 12.27% with a dose of 800 kGy), and new products of radiolysis appeared (up to five with a dose of 800 kGy). However, there were no differences between the NMR and MS spectra of irradiated and non-irradiated samples of FF. A linear dependence was found between the dose of radiation and the FF content (correlation coefficient of 0.9951) as well as between the melting point and the sum of products of radiolysis (correlation coefficient of 0.9975). It was found that a radiodegradation of FF took place by the breaking of an amide bond, leading to the formation of an aliphatic amine, which was subsequently oxidized to 4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid. The radiolytic yield for the radiodegradation of FF was calculated to be 10.24 molecules/100 eV for a dose of 25 kGy. As a result of our investigation, we can conclude that FF shows a reasonably good radiostability in the range of doses used for sterilization, i.e. 25 kGy and below, and therefore it can be sterilized using high-energy radiation without changing its physicochemical, properties and hence its therapeutic efficacy.",M2
19810737,"How the substituent at O-3 of N-acetylglucosamine impacts glycosylation at O-4: a comparative study.An assessment of the relative reactivities of the 4-OH of N-acetylglucosamine acceptors bearing simple protecting groups, beta-linked or alpha-linked D or L sugars at O-3 is presented, using a per-O-acetylated alpha-D-glucosyl trichloroacetimidate donor under activation by BF(3) x OEt(2). The presence of either an acyl or carbonate protecting group at O-3 did not impact the reactivity at O-4 with all glycosylations proceeding successfully. On the other hand, the presence of peracetylated sugars at O-3 of N-acetylglucosamine acceptors did impact the reactivity of the 4-OH. The acceptors with an alpha-D-Man, beta-D-Gal, or beta-D-Glc at O-3 reacted promptly. In comparison, the acceptors bearing a beta-L-Fuc, alpha-L-Fuc, or alpha-L-Rha underwent glucosylation slowly, and unreacted acceptor was recovered from the reaction mixtures. Systematic searches carried out on the disaccharide acceptors and trisaccharide products carrying either a peracetylated beta-D-Gal or beta-L-Fuc at O-3 of the glucosamine residue suggest that, for these two acceptors, a conformational reorientation necessary around the fucosidic linkage contributes to the lower reactivity of the beta-fucosylated acceptor. The acceptors bearing a beta-linked D-Gal, D-Glc, or L-Fuc residue at O-3 each gave trisaccharide products that were mostly stable in the reaction conditions. In contrast, the alpha-linked residues at O-3 were rather unstable in these reaction conditions and the degradation of either the acceptors or trisaccharide products led to low glycosylation yields. In these later reactions, it was impossible to clearly assess which of the acceptor or product underwent degradation as comigration and detection issues prevented us from following these glycosylations by <e>TLC</e> or RP-HPLC. In contrast, the glycosylation of an acceptor carrying an alpha-linked perbenzylated L-Fuc residue at O-3 could be easily monitored by RP-HPLC. The data obtained when monitoring this glycosylation showed that the acceptor underwent prompt glycosylation but a decrease in the absorbance peak corresponding to the trisaccharide along with the appearance of a peak corresponding to a perbenzylated fucose hemiacetal indicated that the trisaccharide product was unstable in the reaction conditions.",M2
19796182,"An epidemic of furniture-related dermatitis: searching for a cause.Background Sitting in new chairs or sofas has elicited dermatitis in numerous patients in Finland and in the U.K. since autumn 2006. The cause of the dermatitis seemed to be an allergen in the furniture materials. Objectives To determine the cause of the dermatitis in patients with furniture-related dermatitis. Methods Altogether 42 patients with furniture-related dermatitis were studied. First, 14 Finnish patients were patch tested with the standardized series and with the chair textile material. A thin-layer chromatogram (<e>TLC</e>) strip and an extract made from the same textile material were tested in seven Finnish patients. The test positive spot of the TLC and the content of a sachet found inside a sofa in the U.K. were analysed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All chemicals analysed were patch tested in 37 patients. Results A positive patch test reaction to the chair textile and to its extract was seen in all patients tested, one-third of whom had concurrent reactions to acrylates. Positive reactions to the same spot of the TLC strip were seen in five of seven patients and dimethyl fumarate was analysed from the spot as well as from the sachet contents. Dimethyl fumarate (0.01%) elicited positive reactions in all the patients. The other chemicals analysed did not elicit positive reactions, but one patient in the U.K. had a positive reaction to tributyl phosphate. Conclusions Sensitization to dimethyl fumarate was seen in all the patients with furniture-related dermatitis. Concurrent sensitization or cross-reactions were common among the sensitized patients.",M2
19784581,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitive activity-guided isolation of two new alkaloids from seeds of Peganum nigellastrum Bunge by an in vitro <e>TLC</e>- bioautographic assay.Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) currently form the basis of the newest drugs available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. For the aim of screening effective AChEIs, the methanol extracts of the seeds of genus Peganum were found to show significant inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) using an in vitro TLC-bioautographic assay. In further studies to seed of P. nigellastrum Bunge, activity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of two new alkaloids nigellastrine I (9) and nigellastrine II (10), and along with eight known alkaloids, vasicinone (1), vasicine (2), harmine (3), deoxyvasicinone (4), deoxyvasicine (5), harmaline (6), harmol (7), harman (8), in which harmol and harman were first isolated from species P. nigellastrum Bunge. As active constituents, all compounds showed good inhibitory activities against AChE. The results of in vitro semi-quality TLC-bioautographic assay showed that harmine, harmaline and harmol displayed a similar AChE inhibitive activities comparing to galanthamine. These results indicated that these alkaloids in P. nigellastrum Bunge could be a potent class of AChEIs.",M2
19774543,"A <e>TLC</e> bioautographic method for the detection of alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitors in plant extracts.INTRODUCTION: Bioautographic assays using TLC play an important role in the search for active compounds from plants. A TLC assay has previously been established for the detection of beta-glucosidase inhibitors but not for alpha-glucosidase. Nonetheless, alpha-glucosidase inhibition is an important target for therapeutic agents against of type 2 diabetes and anti-viral infections. OBJECTIVE: To develop a TLC bioautographic method to detect alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitors in plant extracts. METHODOLOGY: The enzymes alpha- and beta-d-glucosidase were dissolved in sodium acetate buffer. After migration of the samples, the TLC plate was sprayed with enzyme solution and incubated at room temperature for 60 min in the case of alpha-d-glucosidase, and 37 degrees C for 20 min in the case of beta-d-glucosidase. For detection of the active enzyme, solutions of 2-naphthyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside or 2-naphthyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and Fast Blue Salt were mixed at a ratio of 1 : 1 (for alpha-d-glucosidase) or 1 : 4 (for beta-d-glucosidase) and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple background colouration after 2-5 min. RESULTS: Enzyme inhibitors were visualised as white spots on the TLC plates. Conduritol B epoxide inhibited alpha-d-glucosidase and beta-d-glucosidase down to 0.1 microg. Methanol extracts of Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica after migration on TLC gave enzymatic inhibition when applied in amounts of 100 microg for alpha-glucosidase and 50 microg for beta-glucosidase. CONCLUSION: The screening test was able to detect inhibition of alpha- and beta-glucosidases by pure reference substances and by compounds present in complex matrices, such as plant extracts.",M2
19768977,"Antiproliferative activities of five Chinese medicinal herbs and active compounds in Elephantopus scaber.Extracts and fractions prepared from five medicinal herbs used to treat cancer in Chinese folk medicine were tested for their antiproliferative activities on five cancer cell lines using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MTT results revealed that the ethanolic extracts possessed stronger antiproliferative activities than the corresponding aqueous ones. The bioactive fractions of the ethanolic extracts were mostly found in n-hexane and/or ethyl acetate fractions, which by <e>TLC</e> analysis were shown to contain terpenes and/or phenolic compounds. The ethyl acetate fraction from the ethanolic extract of Elephantopus scaber showed the highest effect with IC50 values of less than 25 microg/mL on three susceptible cell lines, namely, PC-3 (human prostate carcinoma cell), CNE (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma epithelial cell) and HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell). Further isolation and analysis of this fraction led to the identification of three sesquiterpene lactones, two flavonoids and five triterpenes. MTT results showed that the sesquiterpene lactones were the most effective group with IC50 values ranging from 0.9 to 7.5 microM while the flavonoids possessed moderate to strong effect with IC50 values ranging from 17.3 to 42.6 microM. However, the triterpenes displayed weak effect with IC50 values larger than 50 microM. Among the active compounds, deoxyelephantopin, a sesquiterpene lactone, exhibited the strongest effect on the PC-3, CNE and HL-60 cells, with IC50 values of 4.6, 2.6 and 0.9 microM, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis showed that treatment with deoxyelephantopin caused subG-1 population augmentation in PC-3, CNE and HL-60 cells, suggesting apoptosis was induced in these cells.",M2
19763990,"Review of the use of phytosterols as a detection tool for adulteration of olive oil with hazelnut oil.Adulteration of virgin olive oil with less expensive oils such as hazelnut oil is a serious problem for quality control of olive oil. Detection of the presence of hazelnut oil in olive oil at low percentages (&lt;20%) is limited with current official standard methods. In this review, various classes of phytosterols in these two oils are assessed as possible markers to detect adulterated olive oil. The composition of 4-desmethyl- and 4-monomethylsterols is similar in both oils, but the 4,4'-dimethylsterols differ. Lupeol and an unknown (lupane skeleton) compound from 4,4'-dimethylsterols are exclusively present in hazelnut oil and can be used as markers via GC-MS monitoring to detect adulteration at levels as low as 2%.

19762032,"Development and validation of a normal-phase high-performance thin layer chromatographic method for the analysis of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in co-trimoxazole tablets.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is often the ultimate mortal cause for immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV/AIDS patients. Currently, the most effective medicine for treatment and prophylaxis is co-trimoxazole, a synergistic combination of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP). In order to ensure a continued availability of high quality co-trimoxazole tablets within resource-limited countries, Medicines Regulatory Authorities must perform quality control of these products. However, most pharmacopoeial methods are based on high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods. Because of the lack of equipment, the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) laboratory decided to develop and validate an alternative method of analysis based on the <e>TLC</e> technique with densitometric detection, for the routine quality control of co-trimoxazole tablets. SMX and TMP were separated on glass-backed silica gel 60 F(254) plates in a high-performance thin layer chromatograph (HPTLC). The mobile phase was comprised of toluene, ethylacetate and methanol (50:28.5:21.5, v:v:v). Detection wavelength was 254 nm. The R(f) values were 0.30 and 0.61 for TMP and SMX, respectively. This method was validated for linearity, precision, trueness, specificity and robustness. Cochran's criterion test indicated homoscedasticity of variances for the calibration data. The F-tests for lack-of-fit indicated that straight lines were adequate to describe the relationship between spot areas and concentrations for each compound. The percentage relative standard deviations for repeatability and time-different precisions were 0.98 and 1.32, and 0.83 and 1.64 for SMX and TMP, respectively. Percentage recovery values were 99.00%+/-1.83 and 99.66%+/-1.21 for SMX and TMP, respectively. The method was found to be robust and was then successfully applied to analyze co-trimoxazole tablet samples.",M2
19745577,"Optimization of enzymatic synthesis of palm-based kojic acid ester using response surface methodology.Kojic acid monooleate is a fatty acid derivative of kojic acid which can be widely used as a skin whitening agent in a cosmetic applications. In avoiding any possible harmful effects from chemically synthesized product, the enzymatic synthesis appears to be the best way to satisfy the consumer demand nowadays. The ability of immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor meihei (lipozyme RMIM) to catalyze the direct esterification of kojic acid and oleic acid was investigated. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and 5-level-4-factor central composite rotatable were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters such as enzyme amount (0.1-0.4 g), temperature (30-60 degrees C), substrate molar ratio (1-4 mmol, kojic acid:oleic acid) and reaction time (24-48 h) on percentage molar conversion to kojic acid monooleate. Analysis of the product using <e>TLC</e>, GC and FTIR showed the presence of kojic acid monooleate. The optimal conditions for the enzymatic reaction were obtained after analysis with backward elimination using 0.17 g of enzyme and 4 mmol of substrate at 52.50 degrees C for 42 h. Under these conditions the esterification percentage was 37.21%. The results demonstrated that response surface methodology can be applied effectively to optimize the lipase-catalysed synthesis of kojic acid monooleate. The optimum conditions can be used to scale up the process.",M2
19740471,"A critical look at the definition of multidimensional separations.Multidimensional (MD) separations, especially comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) separations such as comprehensive 2D LC (LCxLC), and comprehensive 2D GC (GCxGC), are potentially powerful separation techniques. It is important to have a clear definition of MD techniques to better understand the scope and boundaries of the subject. Widely accepted definitions of MD Separations have their roots in the definition proposed by Giddings. Giddings also added several comments that clarified the scope of his definition. However, some researchers extend Giddings' definitions beyond their intended scope. Doing so disqualifies such comprehensive 2D techniques as LCxLC, GCxGC and 2D <e>TLC</e> from being considered as 2D techniques. In other instances, extended treatment of Giddings' definition is used as a basis to justify design-parameters of comprehensive 2D separations despite the fact that these parameters lead to sub-optimal implementations. We believe that the shortcomings in the definition and its popular interpretations are serious enough to warrant attention, especially by those interested in designing optimal instrumentation for MD separations like comprehensive 2D GC. After discussion of the weaknesses in the currently used definitions, we propose to define n-dimensional analysis as one that generates n-dimensional displacement information. We believe that this definition captures the spirit of Giddings' definition while avoiding the problems associated with its popular interpretations.",M2
19740470,"A new lipidomics approach by thin-layer chromatography-blot-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry for analyzing detailed patterns of phospholipid molecular species.Thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) is a highly established convenient technique for lipid separation and partial characterization of neutral and acidic glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and phospholipids, in mixtures. Meanwhile, imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a promising tool for lipidomics. However, some lipid classes are detected more sensitively than others, which can lead to suppression effects when complex mixtures are analyzed. Therefore to analyze complex lipid mixtures, a precise separation into the individual lipid classes is necessary. Here we present our highly sensitive and convenient analytical technology that combines TLC and IMS, namely the TLC-Blot-MALDI-IMS method, to visualize whole lipids and individual molecular species with high sensitivity compared with common staining methods. This method allows for easy visualization of all lipids with a linear range of approximately one order of magnitude and precision &lt;16% RSD, making it useful for differential display analysis of lipids.",M2
19733868,"An experimental approach to study the biosynthesis of brominated metabolites by the red algal genus Laurencia.The production of labeled brominated metabolites with radioactive (82)Br in Laurencia species was investigated as part of a study of the biosynthesis of halogenated metabolites from species belonging to the red algal genus Laurencia (Rhodomelaceae, Ceramiales). Radiobromide [(82)Br], thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>), and TLC-autoradioluminography (ARLG) were used. When cultured in artificial seawater medium (ASP(12)NTA including Na(82)Br) under 16:8 h light:dark (LD) illumination cycles for 24 h, each of the strains of Laurencia, Laurencia japonensis Abe et Masuda, Laurencia nipponica Yamada (laurencin-producing race and laureatin-producing race), and Laurencia okamurae Yamada, produced species- (or race-) specific (82)Br-containing metabolites. In the case of the laurencin-producing race of L. nipponica, laurencin and deacetyllaurencin were found to be produced in approximately 1:1 ratio, though laurencin is the major metabolite in the wild sample. Furthermore, when cultured in the dark, the production rates of brominated metabolites in Laurencia spp. were found to be diminished. The present study strongly indicates that the use of radiobromine [(82)Br] in combination with the TLC-ARLG method is an effective approach for investigating the biosynthesis of brominated metabolites in Laurencia.",M2

Recently, the two well-studied quorum sensing (QS) systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LasR/LasI and RhlR/RhlI, have also been identified in this strain. However, in this study, through the use of lacZ translational fusion expression analysis and acyl-homoserine lactone thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) bioassays, we clearly display a more complex and distinctive hierarchy of the las and rhl QS systems in strain M18. In this QS cascade, expression of rhlI was negatively controlled by the LasR/LasI QS system. In contrast with lasI, which negatively regulated the rhlR induction, lasR exerted a positive influence on rhlR expression during the log-phase. This interrelationship indicated that the response regulators (LasR and RhlR) of the QS system are expressed independently of their cognate synthases (LasI and RhlI). Furthermore, the las system also modulated the timing and magnitude of the rhlI and rhlR maximal expression. In addition, our data imply that the lasR gene exerts its negative control on PCA production through modulation of rhlI expression. Thus, interactions between the two QS systems are strain specific.",M2
19714974,"Simultaneous identification and quantitative determination of selected aminoglycoside antibiotics by thin-layer chromatography and densitometry.A <e>TLC</e>-densitometric method has been developed for simultaneous identification and quantitative determination of amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, and tobramycin. This separation of antibiotics was achieved on silica gel TLC plates without a fluorescent indicator and with methanol-25% ammonia-chloroform (3 + 2 + 1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. The densitometric measurements were made at 500 nm after detection with a 0.2% ninhydrin solution in ethanol. Under these conditions, good separation of the chosen aminoglycosides was obtained. The method is distinguished by high sensitivity, with the LOD from 0.25 microg for amikacin to 1.00 microg for gentamicin and the LOQ from 0.5 microg for amikacin to 1.65 microg for gentamicin, and a wide linearity range 0.75-6.25 microg/spot for amikacin and netilmicin and 1.5-12.50 microg/spot for other antibiotics. The precision of the determination was very good; RSD varied in the range 0.3-0.6%.",M2
19714967,"Estimation of catechin in Ayurvedic oil formulations containing Acacia catechu.A sensitive, simple, rapid, and efficient HPTLC method was developed and validated for the analysis of catechin in marketed Ayurvedic oil formulations containing Acacia catechu. Chromatography of methanolic-0.1% formic acid (7:3, v/v) extracts of these formulations was performed on silica gel 60 F254 aluminum-backed <e>TLC</e> plates of 0.2 mm layer thickness. The plate was developed up to 85 mm with the ternary-mobile phase chloroform-acetone-0.1% formic acid (7.7 + 1.5 + 0.8%, v/v/v) at 22 +/- 2 degrees C with 20 min of chamber saturation. The system produced compact spots of catechin at an Rf value of 0.36. The marker, catechin, was quantified at its maximum absorbance of 296 nm. The limit of detection and quantitation values were 6 and 20 ng/spot, respectively. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plot showed a good linear relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.9993 in the concentration range of 200-1200 ng/spot for catechin with respect to peak area. Repeatability of the method was 0.88% RSD. Recovery values from 97 to 102% indicate excellent accuracy of the method. The developed HPTLC method is accurate, precise, and cost-effective, and it can be successfully applied for the determination of catechin in marketed Ayurvedic oil formulations containing Acacia catechu.",M2
19697313,"Modified <e>TLC</e> bioautographic method for screening acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from plant extracts.The present work describes modifications to an existing TLC bioautographic method for detecting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from plant extracts. The basic principle of the method is that the enzyme converts 1-naphthyl acetate into naphthol which reacts with Fast Blue B salt to make a purple-colored background on the TLC plates. Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases produced white spots on the background. Our modifications involve changes in the concentration of the enzyme, the reagents, and the time of the reaction. With these changes, the consumption of the enzyme was reduced by 85% and the detection limits were decreased remarkably.",M2
19697311,"Simultaneous densitometric determination of shikonin, acetylshikonin, and beta-acetoxyisovaleryl-shikonin in ultrasonic-assisted extracts of four Arnebia species using reversed-phase thin layer chromatography.A simple, precise, and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method for the simultaneous quantification of pharmacologically important naphthoquinone shikonin (1) together with its derivatives acetylshikonin (2), and beta-acetoxyisovalerylshikonin (3) in four species of genus Arnebia (A. euchroma, A. guttata, A. benthamii, and A. hispidissima) from the Indian subcontinent has been developed. In addition, the effect of solvents with varying polarity (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol) for the extraction of these compounds was studied. HPTLC was performed on precoated RP-18 F(254S )<e>TLC</e> plates. For achieving good separation, mobile phase consisting of ACN/methanol/5% formic acid in water (40:02:08 v/v/v) was used. The densitometric determination of shikonin derivatives was carried out at 520 nm in reflection/absorption mode. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, and specificity. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 100-600 ng for shikonin and acetylshikonin, and 100-1800 ng for beta-acetoxyisovalerylshikonin. Lower LOD obtained for compounds 1-3 were 18, 15, and 12 ng, respectively, while the LOQ obtained were 60, 45, and 40 ng, respectively.",M2
19695573,"Separation and identification of some common isomeric plant triterpenoids by thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.Chromatographic separation of 10 triterpenoids (alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, delta-amyrin, lupeol, lupenon, lupeol acetate, cycloartenol, cycloartenol acetate, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid) and 2 sterols (stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol) was studied. The chromatographic techniques included silica gel and reversed-phase (C18 RP) thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) and C18 RP high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using UV and mass spectrometric (MS) detection with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The TLC separation of the isomeric triterpenols lupeol, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin and cycloartenol was achieved for the first time using C18 RP-HPTLC plates. Cycloartenol could be separated from related compounds only on C18 RP-TLC but not on the C18 RP-HPLC. delta-Amyrin isolated from the tomato fruit surface extract could be separated from other amyrins only by HPLC. Tandem mass spectrometry allowed discrimination between the isomers lupeol, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, delta-amyrin, cycloartenol and between lupeol acetate and cycloartenol acetate. The combination of 3 TLC methods and 2 HPLC methods enables qualitative determination of all 12 compounds and proves to be useful for the analysis of plant extracts. It is recommended that TLC screening on silica gel and C18 RP be performed before HPLC analysis.",M2
19690837,"Phosphatidylcholines and -ethanolamines can be easily mistaken in phospholipid mixtures: a negative ion MALDI-TOF MS study with 9-aminoacridine as matrix and egg yolk as selected example.Phospholipids (PL) are increasingly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). As in the case of polar molecules, however, the careful selection of the matrix is crucial for optimum results. 9-Aminoacridine (9-AA) was recently suggested as the matrix of choice to analyze PL mixtures because of (a) the improved sensitivity and (b) the reduction of suppression effects compared to other matrices. However, the distinction of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the negative ion mode is obscured as PC is also detectable as -CH3+ ion if 9-AA is used as matrix. This may result in the erroneous assignment of PC as a PE species. Using an organic extract from hen egg yolk as example it will be shown that the contribution of PC must be taken into consideration if the negative ion mass spectra are used to evaluate the fatty acyl compositions of PE mixtures. 9-AA can as well be used in hyphenated thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>)-MALDI-TOF MS where PC and PE are chromatographically well separated for unequivocal assignments.",M2
19680947,"Quantitative analysis of patulin in apple juice by thin-layer chromatography using a charge coupled device detector.A method was developed and validated in-house for the detection and quantification of patulin in apple juice concentrate using a charge coupled device (CCD) on thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) plates. Samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and then cleaned-up by extraction with a sodium carbonate solution. The method showed a mean recovery of 95%. The quantification and detection limit were 14 microg l(-1) and 0.005 microg per spot, respectively. The CCD camera is sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in spot fluorescence intensity caused by small differences in mycotoxin concentration under homogeneous illumination from a UV light source. The results of validation confirmed the efficiency of the method, which is sensitive enough to be used to quantify patulin in apple juice by producers or for government monitoring/survey programs. The method was applied to the analysis of 16 apple juice concentrate samples and patulin levels ranged from 15 to 46 microg l(-1). This study demonstrated the applicability of the TLC-CCD technique as a tool for monitoring patulin in apple juice.",M2
19673106,"Urinary oligosaccharides: a peripheral marker for Sida carpinifolia exposure or poisoning.Poisoning by Sida carpinifolia belongs to a group of plant-induced phenotype which resembles lysosomal storage diseases. Saanen goats were fed aerial parts of green S. carpinifolia for up to 3 months. Concentrates complemented the nutritional requirements. Urine and blood samples were collected for oligosaccharide study (by thin layer chromatography-<e>TLC</e>) and hemogram analysis, respectively. Abnormal excretion of oligosaccharides was observed from the 2nd day of S. carpinifolia ingestion until one day after withdrawal of the plant from the diet. There were no changes in hemogram. Clinical signs were typical of poisoning caused by plants of this group and were seen from the 37th day on S. carpinifolia diet until seven days after withdrawal of the plant, when signs gradually became scarce and less evident. Results presented here suggest that detection of urinary oligosaccharides by TLC may be an useful method to assess swainsonine-containing plants exposure or an early diagnostic tool for poisoning by these plants.",M2
19671473,"Validation of lipolysis product extraction from aqueous/biological samples, separation and quantification by thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection analysis using O-cholesteryl ethylene glycol as a new internal standard.A general and easily accessible method for the extraction followed by the simultaneous separation and quantitative determination of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids has been improved and optimized based on existing protocols using liquid-phase extraction and thin-layer chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection (<e>TLC</e>/FID Iatroscan). After lipid extraction in the presence of a suitable new synthetic internal standard, namely CholE1, a single elution step using n-heptane/diethyl ether/formic acid (55:45:1, v/v/v) was applied. This method was validated in line with international bioanalytical method validation guidelines using two different matrix systems: purified water and human gastro-intestinal fluid. Overall, the assay was found to have high levels of precision with coefficients of variation ranging from 1.48% to 11.0% and accuracy ranging from -13.3% to +5.79% RE. The confidence limits of the lipid mean recovery rates varied between 89.9% and 104%. This method is therefore highly suitable for quantifying the lipolysis products generated in vitro during the hydrolysis of various fats and oils by digestive lipases, as well as those collected from the gastro-intestinal tract in the course of human clinical studies on lipid digestion.",M2
19648067,"HPLC and <e>TLC</e> characterisation of ecdysteroid alkyl ethers.Semi-synthetic ecdysteroid alkyl ethers have increased potential over natural ecdysteroids as actuators of ligand-inducible gene-expression systems based on the ecdysteroid receptor for in vivo applications. However, a scalable synthesis of these compounds has yet to be developed. We report a set of reversed-phase (RP; C(18) and C(6)) and normal-phase (NP; diol) HPLC systems which can be used to analyse and separate ecdysteroid ethers with single or multiple O-methyl substitutions at the 2alpha-, 3beta-, 14alpha-, 22- and 25-positions. The elution order of methyl ether analogues of the prototypical ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) was 3-methyl&lt;2-methyl&lt;14-methyl&lt;25-methyl&lt;22-methyl with both C(18)- and C(6)-RP-HPLC, when eluted with methanol/water mixtures. Further, the elution order of 20E 22-O-alkyl ethers was methyl&lt;ethyl&lt;allyl&lt;n-propyl&lt;benzyl&lt;n-butyl with both C(18)- and C(6)-RP-HPLC. Moreover, the ecdysteroid alkyl ethers can also be adequately resolved by NP-HPLC and silica HPTLC. On the latter, detection of ecdysteroid O-alkyl ethers with the p-anisaldehyde/sulphuric acid reagent distinguishes 22-O-alkyl ethers from non-22-O-alkyl ether analogues by the colour of the resulting spot.",M2
19647073,"Quantification of F2-isoprostanes as a reliable index of oxidative stress in vivo using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method.Free radical-induced lipid peroxidation has been implicated in a number of human diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. F(2)-Isoprostanes (IsoPs) are isomers of prostaglandin PGF(2alpha) that are generated in vivo from the free radical-initiated peroxidation of arachidonic acid independent of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Since the discovery of the IsoPs in the early 1990s, a large body of evidence has been accumulated to indicate that quantification of these F(2)-IsoPs represents the most reliable biomarker to assess oxidative stress in vivo. A variety of analytical approaches have been developed for the quantification of these novel compounds; these methods include mass spectrometry (MS) detection coupled to gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) separation, and detection using immunological approaches. This article summarizes our current methodology to quantify F(2)-IsoPs in biological fluids and tissues using GC-MS. This method includes solid-phase extraction (SPE), thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) purification, chemical derivatization, and MS detection using negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) coupled with GC.

19641220,"High-throughput, cell-free, liposome-based approach for assessing in vitro activity of lipid kinases.Lipid kinases are central players in lipid signaling pathways involved in inflammation, tumorigenesis, and metabolic syndrome. A number of these kinase targets have proven difficult to investigate in higher throughput cell-free assay systems. This challenge is partially due to specific substrate interaction requirements for several of the lipid kinase family members and the resulting incompatibility of these substrates with most established, homogeneous assay formats. Traditional, cell-free in vitro investigational methods for members of the lipid kinase family typically involve substrate incorporation of [gamma-32P] and resolution of signal by thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) and autoradiograph densitometry. This approach, although highly sensitive, does not lend itself to high-throughput testing of large numbers of small molecules (100 s to 1 MM+). The authors present the development and implementation of a fully synthetic, liposome-based assay for assessing in vitro activity of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-kinase isoforms (PIP4KIIbeta and alpha) in 2 commonly used homogeneous technologies. They have validated these assays through compound testing in both traditional TLC and radioactive filterplate approaches as well as binding validation using isothermic calorimetry. A directed library representing known kinase pharmacophores was screened against type IIbeta phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase (PIPK) to identify small-molecule inhibitors. This assay system can be applied to other types and isoforms of PIPKs as well as a variety of other lipid kinase targets.",M2
19631740,"Compatibility studies of acyclovir and lactose in physical mixtures and commercial tablets.This study documents drug-excipient incompatibility studies of acyclovir in physical mixtures with lactose and in different tablet brands. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was initially used to assess compatibility of mixtures. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was also compared with the spectra of pure drug and excipient. Although DSC results indicated incompatibility with lactose, FTIR spectra were mostly unmodified due to overlapping peaks. Samples of isothermally stressed physical mixture were stored at 95 degrees C for 24 h. The residual drug was monitored using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay and data fitting to solid-state kinetic models was performed. The drug loss kinetics followed a diffusion model. The aqueous mixture of drug and excipient was heated in order to prepare an adduct mixture. HPLC analysis revealed one extra peak that was fractionated and subsequently injected into the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. The MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) chromatograms characterized the peak with molecular mass corresponding to an acyclovir-lactose Maillard reaction product. The presence of lactose in commercial tablets was checked using a new <e>TLC</e> method. Overall, the incompatibility of acyclovir with lactose was successfully evaluated using a combination of thermal methods and LC-MS/MS.",M2

The analysis of formulations containing analgesic (paracetamol), decongestant (ephedrine), opiate (codeine) and stimulant (caffeine) active pharmaceutical ingredients is described, with and without chromatographic development to separate the active ingredients from the excipient formulation. Selectivity was enhanced by combining ion mobility and mass spectrometry to characterise the desorbed gas-phase analyte ions on the basis of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and gas-phase ion mobility (drift time). The solvent composition of the DESI spray using a step gradient was varied to optimise the desorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients from the RP-TLC plates. The combined RP-TLC/DESI-IM-MS approach has potential as a rapid and selective technique for pharmaceutical analysis by orthogonal gas-phase electrophoretic and mass-to-charge separation.",M2

19609886,"Advances on the compositional analysis of glycosphingolipids combining thin-layer chromatography with mass spectrometry.Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), composed of a hydrophilic carbohydrate chain and a lipophilic ceramide anchor, play pivotal roles in countless biological processes, including infectious diseases and the development of cancer. Knowledge of the number and sequence of monosaccharides and their anomeric configuration and linkage type, which make up the principal items of the glyco code of biologically active carbohydrate chains, is essential for exploring the function of GSLs. As part of the investigation of the vertebrate glycome, GSL analysis is undergoing rapid expansion owing to the application of novel biochemical and biophysical technologies. Mass spectrometry (MS) takes part in the network of collaborations to further unravel structural and functional aspects within the fascinating world of GSLs with the ultimate aim to better define their role in human health and disease. However, a single-method analytical MS technique without supporting tools is limited yielding only partial structural information. Because of its superior resolving power, robustness, and easy handling, high-performance thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) is widely used as an invaluable tool in GSL analysis. The intention of this review is to give an insight into current advances obtained by coupling supplementary techniques such as TLC and mass spectrometry. A retrospective view of the development of this concept and the recent improvements by merging (1) TLC separation of GSLs, (2) their detection with oligosaccharide-specific proteins, and (3) in situ MS analysis of protein-detected GSLs directly on the TLC plate, are provided. The procedure works on a nanogram scale and was successfully applied to the identification of cancer-associated GSLs in several types of human tumors. The combination of these two supplementary techniques opens new doors by delivering specific structural information of trace quantities of GSLs with only limited investment in sample preparation.",M2
19609885,"Identification of a naturally-occurring 8-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]daidzein from cultivated kudzu root.INTRODUCTION: Kudzu root (Radix puerariae) is a rich source of isoflavones that are effective in preventing osteoporosis, heart disease and symptoms associated with menopause. The major isoflavonoids in kudzu root extracts were reported as puerarin, daidzin and daidzein. Recently, an unknown isoflavonoid (compound 1) was detected from one-year-old kudzu root cultivated in Vietnam. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel compound 1 in kudzu root extract and determine the structure of the compound by ESI(+) TOF MS-MS, (1)H-, (13)C-NMR and enzymatic hydrolysis. METHODOLOGY: Samples were prepared by extraction of one-year-old kudzu root with 50% ethanol and the isoflavonoids were purified using recycling preparative HPLC. Unknown compound 1 was detected using UV-light at 254 nm in <e>TLC</e> and HPLC analyses. The molecular weight of 1 was determined using a TOF mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. The structure of 1 was determined from the (13)C and (1)H NMR spectra recorded at 100.40 and 400.0 MHz, respectively. RESULTS: ESI(+) TOF MS-MS analysis shows that 1 is a puerarin diglycoside. The interglycosidic linkage of diglycoside determined by (1)H-, (13)C-NMR, and enzymatic hydrolysis suggests that 1 has a glucosyl residue linked to puerarin by an alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond. This compound is the first naturally-occurring 8-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]daidzein in kudzu root. The concentration of glucosyl-alpha-1,6-puerarin in kudzu root was 2.3 mg/g as determined by HPLC. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that puerarin diglycoside is one of the major isoflavonoids in kudzu root and has a significant impact on the preparation of highly water-soluble glycosylated puerarin.",M2
19609036,"Optimization of a solid-phase extraction protocol for fractionation of selected steroids using retention data from micro thin-layer chromatography.In this paper a simple protocol is described for estimating of solid-phase extraction (SPE) elution volumes of steroids based on retention data generated from micro-planar chromatography. Particularly, the retention of selected steroids, including estrogens and progestagens, was studied on wettable with water octadecylsilica HPTLC plates and mobile phases composed of methanol:water mixtures ranging from 20 to 100% (v/v). It was found that <e>TLC</e> retention data can be linearized by plotting R(M) values of steroids against a reciprocal form of the organic modifier molar fraction (1/X(s)). Using such a mathematical approach, the retention parameter of steroids investigated could be easily back-calculated for a wide range of mobile-phase compositions, using few initial experimental data points. The hold-up time of SPE cartridges filled with 0.5 g of C-18 adsorbent was determined experimentally, and appropriate retention factor values (k(SPE)) for components of interest studied were calculated. Using an appropriate slope and intercept coefficients of the linear-regression equation formed as log k(SPE) = aR(M) + b, the steroids SPE elution volumes were predicted beyond the experimental data range that was available for a solid-phase extraction experiment, particularly for mobile phases that contained a high level of water.",M2

From liquid culture a mixture of polypeptide antibiotics (peptaibols) belonging to the paracelsin family was isolated and characterized. This peptide mixture was purified by column chromatography and preparative <e>TLC</e> on silica gel, and separated by analytical HPLC. It was analysed by MALDI-TOF MS and nano-ESI-QTOF MS. Tandem mass experiments were performed to determine the amino acid sequences based on the fragmentation pattern of selected parent ions. The mixture comprised 20-residue peptides with C-terminal phenylalaninol and N-terminal acetylation. Twenty-eight amino acid sequences were identified, and amino acid exchanges were located in positions 6, 9, 12 and 17. Among them, seven sequences are new as compared to those reported in the database specifically for peptaibols and in the literature. In addition, we obtained experimental evidence suggesting the existence of non-covalent dimeric forms (homo- and hetero-) of the various peptaibol species. The peptide mixture showed strong antifungal activity toward seven important forest tree pathogens, and it was highly toxic in an Artemia salina (brine shrimp) bioassay. These results emphasize the cryptic role of endophytic fungi as a source of novel bioactive natural products and biocontrol agents.",M2

19533593,"Direct analysis of curcumin in turmeric by DART-MS.INTRODUCTION: The new ion source technique, direct analysis in real time (DART) atmospheric pressure ionisation, allows high resolution mass measurements of gas, liquid and solid samples. As DART-MS produces [M + H](+) molecular ions of most compounds, relatively simple and clear mass spectra are obtained even of multi-component samples. In order to take advantage of the capacity of DART-MS for the real time analysis of individual compounds in natural raw materials, a pilot study was performed using the well-known antioxidant botanical drug, turmeric. OBJECTIVE: To establish the analysis methods of curcumin and its derivatives from various types of samples with DART-MS and compare the efficiency of the method with traditional HPLC method. RESULTS: Different curcuminoids were successfully detected directly from the raw particles of Curcuma longa. When a turmeric extract was separated on a <e>TLC</e> plate, each band produced molecular ion peaks corresponding to curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Molecular ions of curcuminoids in turmeric-containing beverages and curry powder were also efficiently detected. In addition to high efficiency of qualitative analysis, the evaluation of its linearity showed that DART-MS can be applied for semi-quantitative determinations of curcumin over a large range (5-100 microg/mL). CONCLUSION: A simple chemical profiling and semi-quantitative method for natural products using DART-MS might be applied to diverse field related quality control of medicinal plants or food ingredients.",M2
19523224,"Isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from Mentha longifolia L. leaves grown wild in Iraq.BACKGROUND: Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. METHODS: The compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: <e>TLC</e>, FTIR spectra and HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0). CONCLUSION: The isolation of an antimicrobial compound from M. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.",M2

19505552,"Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and mutagenic investigation of the South African tree aloe (Aloe barberae).ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: In recent times, many products ranging from aloe drinks to aloe gels, powders, capsules, and creams have appeared on the commercial market prepared from different aloe species including Aloe barberae. These products are used in ethnomedicine to treat various conditions including gastrointestinal disorders, insect bites, skin burns and other skin injuries by traditional communities. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed at evaluating the antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities as well as genotoxic effects of different extracts of Aloe barberae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organic and water extracts of the upper stem, young bark, mature bark, leaves and roots of the South African tree aloe (Aloe barberae) were evaluated for their antimicrobial [gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria as well as the fungus Candida albicans], anti-inflammatory (COX-1 and COX-2) and mutagenic properties (Ames test). Thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) was used to compare the phytochemical profiles of different extracts of Aloe barberae. RESULTS: The petroleum ether (PE) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of the mature bark, leaves and roots exhibited good activity against all the bacteria and fungus Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.195 to 1.56 mg/ml. All the PE extracts evaluated showed a high activity (&gt;70%) in both COX-1 and COX-2 assays. Apart from the organic extracts of the root with consistently good activity (&gt;70%), all the remaining extracts showed moderate activity (40-69%) in COX-1 assay. The PE extracts also showed a dose dependent increase in activity. Ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the leaves and root EtOH extracts indicated the presence of compounds that could absorb UV light (wavelength: 190-820 nm). None of the extracts had a mutagenic effect in the Salmonella/microsome assay against a tester strain, TA98. CONCLUSION: Activity observed in the bark, leaves and roots of Aloe barberae validates its use in commercial herbal products, ethnobotany and ethnoveterinary medicine by South African communities and small scale farmers to treat various conditions.",M2

19485199,"Development of chromatographic methods for determination of agrimoniin and related polyphenols in pharmaceutical products.Thin-layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) and liquid chromatography (LC) methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative determination of agrimoniin, pedunculagin, ellagic acid, gallic acid, and catechin in selected herbal medicinal products from Rosaceae: Anserinae herba, Tormentillae rhizoma, Alchemillae herba, Agrimoniae herba, and Fragariae folium. Unmodified silica gel (TLC Si60, HPTLC LiChrospher Si60) and silica gel chemically modified with octadecyl or aminopropyl groups (HPTLC RP18W and HPTLC NH2) were used for TLC. The best resolution and selectivity were achieved with the following mobile phases: diisopropyl ether-acetone-formic acid-water (40 + 30 + 20 + 10, v/v/v/v), tetrahydrofuran-acetonitrile-water (30 + 10 + 60, v/v/v), and acetone-formic acid (60 + 40, v/v). Concentrations of the studied herbal drugs were determined by using a Chromolith Performance RP-18e column with acetonitrile-water-formic acid as the mobile phase. Determinations of linearity, range, detection and quantitation limits, accuracy, precision, and robustness showed that the HPLC method was sufficiently precise for estimation of the tannins and related polyphenols mentioned above. Investigations of suitable solvent selection, sample extraction procedure, and short-time stability of analytes at storage temperatures of 4 and 20 degrees C were also performed. The percentage of agrimoniin in pharmaceutical products was between 0.57 and 3.23%.",M2
19485196,"Application of a stability-indicating thin-layer chromatographic method to the determination of tenatoprazole in pharmaceutical dosage forms.A sensitive, selective, precise, and stability-indicating thin-layer chromatographic (<e>TLC</e>) method was developed and validated for the determination of tenatoprazole both as a bulk drug and in formulation. The method uses TLC aluminum plates precoated with Silica Gel 60F-254 as the stationary phase and the solvent system toluene-ethyl acetate-methanol (6 + 4 + 1, v/v/v). This system gave compact spots for tenatoprazole (Rf value of 0.34 +/- 0.02). Tenatoprazole was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, and photodegradation. The peaks of the degradation products were well-resolved from that of the pure drug and had significantly different Rf values. Densitometric analysis of tenatoprazole was performed in the absorbance mode at 306 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship over the concentration range of 100-1500 ng/spot. The mean values of the correlation coefficient, slope, and intercept were 0.9989 +/- 1.42, 10.27 +/- 0.965, and 4894.2 +/- 1.24, respectively. The method was validated for precision, robustness, and recovery. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 50 and 100 ng/spot, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the method is repeatable and selective for estimation of tenatoprazole. Because the method can separate the drug from its degradation products, it can be used to monitor stability.",M2

19468794,"Visualizing a plant defense and insect counterploy: alkaloid distribution in Lobelia leaves trenched by a plusiine caterpillar.Insects that feed on plants protected by latex canals often sever leaf veins or cut trenches across leaves before feeding distal to the cuts. The insects thereby depressurize the canals and reduce latex exudation at their prospective feeding site. How the cuts affect the distribution and concentration of latex chemicals was not known. We modified a microwave-assisted extraction technique to analyze the spatial distribution of alkaloids in leaves of Lobelia cardinalis (Campanulaceae) that have been trenched by a plusiine caterpillar, Enigmogramma basigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We produced sharp two dimensional maps of alkaloid distribution by microwaving leaves to transfer alkaloids to <e>TLC</e> plates that were then sprayed with Dragendorff's reagent to visualize the alkaloids. The leaf prints were photographed and analyzed with image processing software for quantifying alkaloid levels. A comparison of control and trenched leaves documented that trenching reduces alkaloid levels by approximately 50% both distal and proximal to the trench. The trench becomes greatly enriched in alkaloids due to latex draining from surrounding areas. Measurements of exudation from trenched leaves demonstrate that latex pressures are rapidly restored proximal, but not distal to the trench. Thus, the trench serves not only to drain latex with alkaloids from the caterpillar's prospective feeding site, but also to isolate this section, thereby preventing an influx of latex from an extensive area that likely extends beyond the leaf. Microwave-assisted extraction of leaves has potential for diverse applications that include visualizing the impact of pathogens, leaf miners, sap-sucking insects, and other herbivores on the distribution and abundance of alkaloids and other important defensive compounds.",M2
19450228,"Product development studies of amino acid conjugate of Aceclofenac.The prodrugs designed by classical approach increase lipophilicity of the drug, which decreases the water solubility thus decreasing the concentration gradient, which controls drug absorption. To overcome the limitations of traditional prodrug approach, water soluble prodrugs can be designed by adding selected amino acid to the drug moiety that are the substrates for the enzyme located at the intestinal brush border thus overcoming pharmaceutical problem without compromising bioavailability. ACaa (Amino acid conjugate of Aceclofenac) was synthesized by conjugation with l-phenylalanine by conventional coupling method using N, N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and ACaa was characterized by melting point, <e>TLC</e>, photomicrograph, UV, FT-IR, FT-NMR, MS-FAB, XRD and DSC. As a part of product development study ACaa was subjected to studies like In-vivo in albino rats and in-vitro like ACaa reversion to AC (Aceclofenac) in aqueous buffers of pH 1.21, 2.38. 3.10, 6.22 and 7.41, at a constant concentration (0.05M), ionic strength (micro = 0.5) and at a temperature of 37 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C, ACaa showed negligible reversion (2.15 %) up to 24 hrs study at acidic pH thus suggesting stability in acidic environment of stomach, the rate of reversion increased as pH of medium increased. pH- partition profile, pH- solubility profile and micromeritic studies were also carried out in comparison to pure drug. The solubility and lipophilicity of ACaa exhibited higher values at all pH range when compared to AC. The micromeritic properties also evaluated in terms of particle shape and size, IQCS and kurtosis. Resulting IQCS value approached zero thus suggesting reducing in the degree of skewness.",M2
19447891,"Discovery and characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine synthase.N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are lipids involved in several physiological processes in animal and plant cells. In brain, NAEs are ligands of endocannabinoid receptors, which modulate various signaling pathways. In plant, NAEs regulate seed germination and root development, and they are involved in plant defense against pathogen attack. This signaling activity is started by an enzyme called N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) synthase. This catalyzes the N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form NAPE, which is most likely hydrolyzed by phospholipase D beta/gamma isoforms to generate NAE. This compound is further catabolized by fatty amide hydrolase. The genes encoding the enzymes involved in NAE metabolism are well characterized except for the NAPE synthase gene(s). By heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and overexpression in plants, we characterized an acyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (At1g78690p) catalyzing the synthesis of lipids identified as NAPEs (two-dimensional <e>TLC</e>, phospholipase D hydrolysis assay, and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses). The ability of free fatty acid and acyl-CoA to be used as acyl donor was compared in vitro with E. coli membranes and purified enzyme (obtained by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography). In both cases, NAPE was synthesized only in the presence of acyl-CoA. beta-Glucuronidase promoter experiments revealed a strong expression in roots and young tissues of plants. Using yellow fluorescent protein fusion, we showed that the NAPE synthase is located in the plasmalemma of plant cells.",M2
19446824,"New method for the quantification of dequalinium cations in pharmaceutical samples by absorption and fluorescence diode array thin-layer chromatography.A diode array HPTLC method for dequalinium chloride in pharmaceutical preparations is presented. For separation a Nano <e>TLC</e> silica gel plate (Merck) is used with the mobile phase methanol-7.8% aqueous NH(4)(+)CH(3)COO(-) (17:3, v/v) over a distance of 6 cm. Dequalinium chloride shows an R(F) value of 0.58. Pure dequalinium chloride is measured in the wavelength range from 200 to 500 nm and shows several by-products, contour plot visualized in absorption, fluorescence and using the Kubelka-Munk transformation. Scanning of a single track in absorption and fluorescence measuring 600 spectra in the range from 200 to 1100 nm takes 30s. As a sample pre-treatment of an ointment it is simply dissolved in methanol and can be quantified in absorption from 315 to 340 nm. The same separation can also be quantified using fluorescence spectrometry in the range from 355 to 370 nm. A new staining method for dequalinium chloride, using sodium tetraphenyl borate/HCl in water allows a fluorescence quantification in the range from 445 to 485 nm. The linearity range of absorption and fluorescence measurements is from 10 to 2000 ng. Sugar-containing preparations like liquids or lozenges with a reduced sample pre-treatment can be reliably quantified only in fluorescence.

Among those tested, only three basidiomycete crude extracts exhibited significant inhibition on pathogen sporulation, zoospore release and zoospore motility. In vitro, the chloroform extract of Ganoderma appalantum (3 mg mL(-1)) recorded a maximum sporangial inhibition of 52.5 and 82.0% zoospore release and 92.5% motility. Crude extracts of three different basidiomycete fungi were treated to pearl millet seeds and assessed for seed germination, seedling vigour and effectiveness against downy mildew disease under greenhouse conditions. None of the solvent extracts were found to be phytotoxic. Chloroform and petroleum ether extracts of G. appalantum (3 mg mL(-1)) proved to be the best by offering disease protection of 55.6 and 43.7%, respectively, followed by chloroform and petroleum ether extracts of Polyphorus spp., with 42.5 and 39.1% disease protection. The thin layer chromatography (<e>TLC</e>) spots that developed were eluted and tested for inhibition of S. graminicola zoosporangia. The partially purified compound from TLC chloroform extract of G. appalantum consistently showed good inhibitory effect against S. graminicola, which exhibited inhibition of sporangia (42.3%), zoospore release (76.7%) and zoospore motility (86.7%), compared to the chloroform control which offered only 1.9, 2.9 and 1.7% inhibition of sporangia, zoospore release and zoospore motility, respectively. The partially purified compound from petroleum ether extract of G. appalantum resulted in 38.0, 63.0 and 81.6% inhibition of sporangia, zoospore release and motility, respectively, compared to petroleum ether control.

19389917,"Transglycosylation-based fluorescent labeling of 6-gala series glycolipids by endogalactosylceramidase.Although 6-gala series glycosphingolipids possessing R-Gal (alpha/beta) 1-6Gal beta 1-1'Cer have been found in some mollusks, pathogenic parasites, and fungi, their physiological functions and metabolic pathway are not fully understood. We described a novel method of detecting 6-gala series glyco- sphingolipids utilizing the specificity of endogalactosylceramidase (EGALC), which is capable of hydrolyzing 6-gala series glycosphingolipids to produce intact oligosaccharides and ceramides. EGALC catalyzes not only hydrolysis but also a transglycosylation reaction. In the latter reaction, EGALC transfers oligosaccharides from the glycosphingolipids to acceptors such as fluorescent 1-alkanols. Based on the transglycosylation reaction of EGALC, a specific, easy, fast, sensitive, and reproducible method of detecting 6-gala series glycosphingolipids was developed using NBD-pentanol as an acceptor. The fluorescent products, NBD-pentanol-conjugated 6-gala oligosaccharides, were separated and detected by <e>TLC</e> or HPLC with a fluorescent detector. Moreover, it was revealed that as well as glycosphingolipids, a glycoglycerolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, was utilized by EGALC as a donor substrate. This method was successfully applied to detect 6-gala series glycosphingolipids in a fungus, Rhizopus oryzae, and a parasite, Taenia crassiceps. The method would be useful for studying glycosphingolipids and galactosyl glycerolipids which share the Gal (alpha/beta) 1-6Gal structure.",M2
