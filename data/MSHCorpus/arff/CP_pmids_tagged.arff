20434617,"Test-retest reliability of discrete gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy.OBJECTIVES: To examine the test-retest reliability of discrete gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I, II, and III; to calculate the measurement error between testing sessions of these parameters in the total sample and within GMFCS subgroups using the standard error of measurement; and to evaluate the minimal detectable change (MDC) to identify discrete gait parameters that are most sensitive to change in children with CP. DESIGN: Test-retest reliability study. SETTING: Rehabilitation facility with human movement laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory children with CP (N=28). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurement, and MDC of discrete gait parameters. RESULTS: Parameters measured in the sagittal plane and temporal-spatial parameters were highly reliable across all GMFCS levels (ICC range, .84-.97), while test-retest reliability in the frontal and transverse planes varied from poor to excellent (ICC range, .46-.91). Using MDC as a guide, hip and pelvis parameters in the transverse and frontal planes were least responsive for GMFCS levels I and III (MDC ranges, 8.3 degrees -18.0 degrees and 2.7 degrees -23.4 degrees , respectively), whereas ankle kinematics were the least responsive for level II (MDC range, 8.2 degrees -11.9 degrees ). Reliability was dependent on mobility level, with children in GMFCS level III exhibiting greater test-retest variability overall. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that select discrete gait parameters measured using computerized gait analysis are reliable and potentially responsive measures of performance and can be used as outcome measures in intervention studies.",M1
20425296,"Psychiatric complications in cerebral palsy.Cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is a disorder of motor and posture impairment resulting from brain injury prior to completion of cerebral development. It affects 2 to 3 per 1000 individuals. CP is also associated with sensory, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional sequelae. Few systematic studies of psychiatric comorbidities in children and adolescents with CP have been conducted, as the main focus of concern has been on the physical disabilities. This has diverted attention from treatable psychiatric syndromes. Proper psychiatric evaluation of children with CP is an important task, as appropriate interventions can help them reach their full potential and enhance the quality of their lives and those of their families. We report the case of an individual with CP with behavioral and emotional symptoms to illustrate the diagnostic complexity involved. The case highlights the importance of engaging in a comprehensive diagnostic psychiatric evaluation process to assess and suggest treatment options for accompanying comorbid psychiatric conditions.",M1
20415771,"Socio-economic inequalities in cerebral palsy prevalence in the United Kingdom: a register-based study.Evidence is unclear as to whether there is a socio-economic gradient in cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) prevalence beyond what would be expected from the socio-economic gradient for low birthweight, a strong risk factor for CP. We conducted a population-based study in five regions of the UK with CP registers, to investigate the relationship between CP prevalence and socio-economic deprivation, and how it varies by region, by birthweight and by severity and type of CP. The total study population was 1 657 569 livebirths, born between 1984 and 1997. Wards of residence were classified into five quintiles according to a census-based deprivation index, from Q1 (least deprived) to Q5 (most deprived). Socio-economic gradients were modelled by Poisson regression, and region-specific estimates combined by meta-analysis. The prevalence of postneonatally acquired CP was 0.14 per 1000 livebirths overall. The mean deprivation gradient, expressed as the relative risk in the most deprived vs. the least deprived quintile, was 1.86 (95% confidence interval [95% CI 1.19, 2.88]). The prevalence of non-acquired CP was 2.22 per 1000 livebirths. For non-acquired CP the gradient was 1.16 [95% CI 1.00, 1.35]. Evidence for a socio-economic gradient was strongest for spastic bilateral cases (1.32 [95% CI 1.09, 1.59]) and cases with severe intellectual impairment (1.59 [95% CI 1.06, 2.39]). There was evidence for differences in gradient between regions. The gradient of risk of CP among normal birthweight births was not statistically significant overall (1.21 [95% CI 0.95, 1.54]), but was significant in two regions. There was non-significant evidence of a reduction in gradients over time. The reduction of the higher rates of postneonatally acquired CP in the more socioeconomically deprived areas is a clear goal for prevention. While we found evidence for a socio-economic gradient for non-acquired CP of antenatal or perinatal origin, the picture was not consistent across regions, and there was some evidence of a decline in inequalities over time. The steeper gradients in some regions for normal birthweight cases and cases with severe intellectual impairment require further investigation.",M1
20412253,"Determinants of responsiveness to botulinum toxin, casting, and bracing in the treatment of spastic equinus in children with cerebral palsy.AIM: The objective was to determine whether specific intrinsic (age, pattern of cerebral palsy [<e>CP</e>], child's motivation) and extrinsic (number of treatments, parenting stress) characteristics were associated with responsiveness to botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injections in children with CP 3 months after injection into the gastrocnemius muscle. METHOD: Children with hemiplegia or diplegia recruited from a BoNT-A programme were evaluated before and 3 months following injection of BoNT-A into the gastrocnemius. Outcome measures included muscle tone, range of motion, gait pattern, level of ambulation, gross motor function, and functional independence. Determinants of responsiveness to BoNT-A considered were age, number of treatments, distribution of CP, parenting stress, and motivation. RESULTS: Thirty-one children were recruited (17 males, 14 females)--22 with hemiplegia and nine with diplegia. Twenty-eight were classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I and three at level III. The mean age was 6 years 4 months (SD 2y 11mo). Younger age (p=0.015) and fewer number (p=0.024) of BoNT-A treatments were associated with greater change in gross motor function. Child's motivation and parenting stress were significantly associated with improvements in muscle tone (p=0.006-0.017), passive range of motion (p=0.008-0.033), gait pattern (p=0.005-0.042), level of ambulation (p=0.001-0.043), and functional independence (p=0.004-0.027). INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that child, family, and treatment characteristics influence the degree of responsiveness to BoNT-A treatment. The contribution of contextual factors (personal and environmental) on responsiveness may be underappreciated in children with CP.",M1
20398394,"Study of the therapeutic effects of an advanced hippotherapy simulator in children with cerebral palsy: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although hippotherapy treatment has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects on children with cerebral palsy, the samples used in research studies have been very small. In the case of hippotherapy simulators, there are no studies that either recommend or advise against their use in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy. The aim of this randomised clinical study is to analyse the therapeutic effects or the contraindications of the use of a commercial hippotherapy simulator on several important factors relating to children with cerebral palsy such as their motor development, balance control in the sitting posture, hip abduction range of motion and electromyographic activity of adductor musculature. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled trial. It will be carried out with a sample of 37 children with cerebral palsy divided into two treatment groups. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive either (a) Treatment Group with hippotherapy simulator, maintaining sitting posture, with legs in abduction and rhythmic movement of the simulator or (b) Treatment Group maintaining sitting posture, with legs in abduction and without rhythmic movement of the simulator. Data collection and analysis: all measurements will be carried out by a specially trained blind assessor. To ensure standardization quality of the assessors, an inter-examiner agreement will be worked out at the start of the study. The trial is funded by the Department of Research, Innovation and Development of the Regional Government of Aragon (Official Bulletin of Aragon 23 July 2007), project number PM059/2007. DISCUSSION: Interest in this project is due to the following factors: Clinical originality (there are no previous studies analysing the effect of simulators on the population group of children with <e>CP</e>, nor any studies using as many variables as this project); Clinical impact (infantile cerebral palsy is a chronic multisystemic condition that affects not only the patient but also the patient's family and their close circle of friends); Practical benefits (the development of an effective treatment is very important for introducing this element into the rehabilitation of these children).

20382296,"Evaluation of the catch in spasticity assessment in children with cerebral palsy.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the catch in clinical spasticity assessment in cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is the consequence of a sudden velocity-dependent increase in muscle activity, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex in spasticity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A special school for children with physical disabilities. PARTICIPANTS: Children with CP (N=20; age range, 5-14y; mean weight +/- SD, 35+/-14kg; mean length +/- SD, 139+/-19cm). INTERVENTIONS: Spasticity assessment tests (using slow and fast passive stretch) were performed in the medial hamstrings, soleus, and medial gastrocnemius muscles of the children by 2 experienced examiners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded and joint motion was simultaneously measured using 2 inertial sensors. The encounter of a catch by the examiner was compared with the presence of a sudden increase in muscle activity ( burst ). The average rectified value (ARV) of the EMG signal was calculated for each test. RESULTS: The study shows a sudden increase in muscle activity in fast passive stretch, followed by a catch (hamstrings 100%, soleus 95%, gastrocnemius 84%). The ARV in slow passive stretch was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that in children with CP, an increase in muscle activity is primarily responsible for a catch in fast passive muscle stretch.",M1
20367519,"Changes in trunk and head stability in children with cerebral palsy after hippotherapy: a pilot study.Hippotherapy (HPOT) is a therapy that uses horse movement. This pilot investigation objectively evaluated the efficacy of HPOT in improving head/trunk stability in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). The participants were six children with spastic diplegia and six children without disability. Head and trunk stability was challenged by using a motorized barrel and measured by a video motion capture system before and after a 12-week intervention of 45 min of HPOT a week. The variables measured were anterior-posterior (AP) translation of the head, and spine at five points and average AP head angles. At pre-testing, children with CP demonstrated significant differences in AP translation and AP head rotation compared with children without disability. Following HPOT, children with CP demonstrated significant reductions in head rotation and AP translation at C7, eye, and vertex. At post-testing, translation at C7 did not differ significantly between children with CP and children without disability. After HPOT intervention, children with CP reduced their AP head rotation and translation, suggesting that they had increased stability of the head and trunk in response to perturbations at the pelvis. The findings suggest that HPOT might improve head and trunk stability in children with CP.",M1
20367518,"Reliability of the functional mobility scale for children with cerebral palsy.This study examined inter-rater reliability of the Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) for children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and the presence of rater bias. A consecutive sample of 118 children with CP, 2-18 years old (mean 10.3 years, SD 3.6), was recruited from a hospital setting. Children were classified using the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) with 13 in Level I, 49 in Level II, 44 in Level III, and 12 in Level IV. Each child was independently scored on the FMS by two raters. Raters were randomly assigned from a sample of 44 orthopaedic surgeons, hospital-based physiotherapists, and community-based physiotherapists. Quadratic weighted kappa coefficients for mobility ratings varied from 0.86 to 0.92 for the three distances, indicating substantial chance corrected agreement. Levels of agreement were similar when administering the scale in person and by telephone, suggesting that the FMS can be administered by either method. There was a tendency for surgeons to rate mobility higher than physiotherapists, however, only one of the comparisons was statistically significant. The FMS is a reliable tool that can be used by clinicians to assess mobility in children with CP.",M1
20357589,"Development of calcaneal gait without prior triceps surae lengthening: an examination of predictive factors.BACKGROUND: Although equinus is more common in cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), the prevalence of calcaneal gait (CG) has been reported at more than 30% among patients with CP, even in the absence of prior surgical intervention. The goal of this study was to identify patient characteristics predictive of the development of CG in patients without prior triceps surae lengthening. METHODS: Gait data were reviewed for 58 participants with bilateral involvement owing to CP (116 limbs) who had 2 gait analysis tests with no triceps surae lengthening between tests. None of the patients exhibited CG at the initial gait study. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they exhibited CG patterns at the second test. Factors potentially predictive of calcaneal gait patterns were compared statistically between groups. RESULTS: CG was shown by 24/116 extremities (21%) at the second study. The CG group experienced greater increase in body weight and body mass index between tests (P=0.006 and 0.03 respectively). Passive dorsiflexion range with the knee flexed was significantly greater in the CG group (P=0.008). The CG group also showed a tendency toward greater plantarflexor weakness, although this only approached statistical significance (P=0.08) likely owing to small sample size. Age, CP subtype, time to follow-up, hamstring range, selective motor control, and gross motor functional level were not predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo (or have potential to undergo) significant weight gain, and have tendencies toward excessive passive dorsiflexion with the knee flexed may be at risk for development of CG over time. In such patients, treatment regimens should include therapy to maintain or improve plantarflexor strength, and methods to prevent overstretching the plantarflexors. Nonsurgical treatments for triceps surae contractures, such as serial casting, may be preferable, to avoid hastening development of calcaneal crouch gait over time. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study---Level III (case-control).",M1
20350360,"Intracranial transplant of olfactory ensheathing cells in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled clinical trial.Successful repair of damage in cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) needs effective clinical interventions other than simply symptomatic treatments. To elucidate the feasibility of using olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) to treat CP in children and adolescents, we conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) on 33 patients. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups (treatment group, n = 18; control group, n = 15), and OECs derived from aborted fetal tissue were injected into the bilateral corona radiata in the frontal lobes (a key point for neural network restoration, KPNNR). The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and the Caregiver Questionnaire Scale were used to evaluate the patients' neurological function and overall health status. Among the 14 patients who completed the 6-month study, six received the cell transplantation and the other eight served as controls. In OEC treatment group, GMFM-66 scores were 26.67 +/- 25.33 compared with 19.00 +/- 20.00 for the control group. Concurrently, the Caregiver Questionnaire Scale score decreased to 77.83 +/- 15.99 in the treatment group in comparison to 138.66 +/- 64.06 of the control group. This trial, albeit small in sample size, indicates OEC KPNNR transplantation is effective for functional improvement in children and adolescents with CP, yet without obvious side effects. This small-scale study suggests that the procedure may be a plausible alternative method to treat this not yet curable disorder, and we urge further evaluation with a large-scale RCT.",M1
20345960,"Risk factors for emergence and progression of scoliosis in children with severe cerebral palsy: a systematic review.AIM: Scoliosis is a frequently occurring and serious complication of severe cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). This systematic review aims to the assess the risk factors associated with the emergence and progression of scoliosis in children with CP functioning at level IV or V of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). METHOD: Relevant studies conducted from 1966 to March 2009 were identified in Embase, Medline, and Scopus. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and relations between risk factors and scoliosis were documented systematically. RESULTS: Ten studies were included. They had a low level of evidence and heterogeneous methodological quality. No systematic associations were found between type of CP and scoliosis or between age, type, and location of scoliotic curve and progression of scoliosis. Weak evidence was present for an association between the severity of CP, hip dislocation, and pelvic obliquity and scoliosis. INTERPRETATION: The low level of evidence precludes the drawing of firm conclusions on risk factors for the emergence and progression of scoliosis in children with severe CP. However, given the high prevalence of the disorder and its serious consequences for daily life, more research in this area is urgently needed.",M1
20338763,"Variability and symmetry of gait in early walkers with and without bilateral cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: Investigating gait characteristics during the early stages of walking in <e>CP</e> may contribute to the understanding of the development of impaired gait. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the variability and symmetry of spatiotemporal gait characteristics during the early years of walking in children with bilateral spastic CP compared to children with similar amounts of walking experience and typical development (TD). METHODS: The spatiotemporal gait parameters of 31 children (15 with spastic CP, 16 with TD) who had an average of 28.5 (18.1 SD) months of walking experience were collected using an instrumented walkway. RESULTS: All primary spatiotemporal parameters were reduced in the CP group, who also demonstrated greater stride-to-stride variability, compared to the TD group. There were no statistically significant differences in side-to-side symmetry between groups. IMPLICATIONS: Clinical trials investigating gait interventions during the early years of walking in children with CP should be conducted to determine if treatment can reduce the functional limitations that are present during the emergence of walking skills. Further investigation should examine variability and symmetry in the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity patterns of early walkers with CP, and the effect of treatment on the variability and symmetry of walking characteristics.",M1
20335916,"Cerebral palsy: classification, diagnosis and challenges of care.This article aims to build capacity between nursing and allied healthcare practitioner staff in highlighting the unique challenges that caring for people with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) brings. It gives an insight into how CP is classified and diagnosed, and briefly outlines issues of political correctness in labelling people with this condition. It covers the complexities of brain development in people with CP, with consideration of the key aetiological contributors to the incidence of the condition. A straightforward approach to unravelling the classification of movement disorders in CP is adopted. It concludes that a multidisciplinary approach to the management of CP, with the nurse at the centre of this holistic approach to patient care, is pivotal to future healthcare provision.",M1
20306774,"Physical activity and health among adolescents with cerebral palsy in Sweden.Cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is the most common disorder of movement and posture in children. The disorder results from a non-progressive brain lesion occurring in the fetal or infant brain. Children with CP have challenges with movement, posture, and mobility that last a life time. Few studies describe physical activity and health among adolescents with CP. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe self-related health, physical activity, and body complaints among adolescents with CP in Sweden. METHODS: A questionnaire was answered by 64 adolescents with CP, with 143 adolescents without disabilities serving as controls. RESULTS: Adolescents with CP reported their general health to be better than adolescents without disabilities (p = .001). Adolescents with CP participated less than adolescents without disabilities in sport during recreation time (p = .009). About 19% of adolescents with CP were never or seldom physically active, compared with 8% in the control group (p = .025). A total of 50% of adolescents with CP reported musculoskeletal complaints during the last three months, compared with 69.5% in the control group. There was a correlation between musculoskeletal complaints and self-related health in adolescents with CP (p = .015) but not in the controls. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with CP reported their general health to be good. Adolescents with CP were less physically active than adolescents without disabilities. There was a correlation between musculoskeletal complaints and self-related health among adolescents with CP. Further research is needed to determine the cause of the low physical activity among adolescents with CP and also to determine the relationship between musculoskeletal complaints and physical activity.",M1
20302440,"Pain prevalence and its impact on the quality of life in a sample of Turkish children with cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: To investigate the measurement properties of the Pain Evaluation Scale (PES), to estimate the prevalence of pain based on the PES data, and to evaluate the impact of pain on the quality of life (QoL) in a sample of Turkish children with <e>CP</e>. METHOD: A total of 346 children with CP participated in a cross-sectional study. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), PES, Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF50) were used as the assessment tools. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.90 for the PES. The PES score was moderately correlated with the bodily pain subscale score, and very weekly with the mental health subscale score of the CHQ-PF50. For the threshold value of 2 on the PES, sensitivity and specificity were 91.1% and 100%, respectively. Overall, apparent prevalence and true prevalence of pain were 69.1% and 75.9%, respectively. There was a significant negative effect of pain on the QoL of subjects. The pain also negatively affected parent's personal time and caused limitations in family activities. CONCLUSIONS: The PES is valid and reliable pain assessment tool for children with CP. Pain is a frequent health problem and has severe consequences both on the cerebral palsied children's QoL and their family.",M1
20300011,"The relation of triceps surae surgical lengthening and crouch gait in patients with cerebral palsy.To investigate the effect of earlier triceps surae (TS) surgical lengthening at knee kinematics in the stance phase in patients with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). One thousand and thirty-nine participants from an eligible total of 1750 children with CP were referred to gait analysis laboratory from January 2000 to April 2007. Inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of diparetic spastic CP levels I to III (GMFCS) and complete kinematics documentation. Patients with an asymmetrical knee pattern at kinematics and with different types of TS management among sides were excluded. The patients were divided into two groups according to the mean minimum knee flexion (MMKF) in stance phase: group A (n=253) MMKF &gt; or =30 degrees and group B (n=786) MMKF less than 30 degrees . For each group, the occurrence of following procedures for TS in the past: (i) earlier surgery, (ii) gastrocnemius lengthening (zone I), (iii) gastrocnemius and soleus lengthening (zone II), and (iv) calcaneous tendon lengthening (zone III), was investigated. A chi test was applied to check if the number of procedures performed was different between groups. The level of significance was defined as P value of less than 0.05. The number of patients with no earlier surgeries at TS was higher in group B (51.8%) than in group A (39.1%), and this difference was significant (P&lt;0.01). In addition, the number of procedures at the calcaneous tendon was more elevated in group A (36.8%) than in group B (27%), and this finding was statistically significant as well (P&lt;0.02). The percentage of surgical lengthening at zones I and II was very similar between the groups A and B. This study has shown that patients without earlier surgical procedures at TS are more susceptible to reach better extension of the knees in the stance phase. Patients in a crouch gait had a higher number of calcaneous tendon lengthening performed in the past than patients with a more normal knee extension in the stance phase.",M1
20298838,"Relationship between age and spasticity in children with diplegic cerebral palsy.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between passive torque, reflex activity, co-contraction, and age during the assessment of spasticity of knee flexors and extensors in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Pediatric orthopedic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Children (N=36) with spastic diplegic CP. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spasticity of the knee flexors and knee extensors (as measured by peak passive torque, mean passive torque, reflex activity of the medial hamstrings, reflex activity of vastus lateralis, and co-contraction) was assessed during passive movements completed using an isokinetic dynamometer with concurrent electromyography. RESULTS: A significant positive relationship was found between age and mean knee flexor passive torque (P&lt;.05), while a significant negative relationship was found between age and mean percentage of the range of motion with co-contraction (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that passive stiffness may play a larger role in spasticity than reflex activity as children with spastic diplegic CP age. Additional research is needed to determine whether subject age could influence the effectiveness of interventions, such as serial casting or botulinum toxin, for spasticity in children with spastic diplegic CP.",M1
20298834,"Reliability of the Tardieu Scale for assessing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.OBJECTIVE: To measure the Tardieu Scale's reliability in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) when used by raters with and without experience in using the scale, before and after training. DESIGN: Single-center, intrarater and interrater reliability study. SETTING: Institutional ambulatory care. PARTICIPANTS: Referred children with CP in the pretraining phase (n=5), during training (n=3), and in the posttraining phase (n=15). INTERVENTIONS: The Tardieu Scale involves performing passive muscle stretch at 2 velocities, slow and fast. The rater derives 2 parameters; the Spasticity Angle X is the difference between the angles of arrest at slow speed and of catch-and-release or clonus at fast speed; the Spasticity Grade Y is an ordinal variable that grades the intensity (gain) of the muscle reaction to fast stretch. In phase 1, experienced raters without formalized training in the scale graded elbow, knee, and ankle plantar flexors bilaterally, without and with a goniometer. In phase 2, after training, the experienced and nonexperienced raters graded the same muscles unilaterally. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intrarater and interrater reliability of the Tardieu Scale. RESULTS: After training, nonexperienced raters had mean +/- SD intrarater and interrater agreement rates across all joints and parameters of 80%+/-14% and 74%+/-16%, respectively. For experienced raters, intrarater and interrater agreement rates before training were 77%+/-13% and 66%+/-15%, respectively, versus 90%+/-8% and 81%+/-13%, respectively, after training (P&lt;.001 for both). Specific angle measurements at the knee were less reliable for the angles of catch measured at fast speed. Across all joints, agreement rates were similar using visual or goniometric measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Both parameters of the Tardieu Scale have excellent intrarater and interrater reliability when assessed at the elbow and ankle joints of children with CP, with no difference noted between visual and goniometric measurements. Angle measurements were less reliable at the knee joints. Training was associated with a highly significant improvement in reliability.",M1
20298820,"Efficacy of partial body weight-supported treadmill training compared with overground walking practice for children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of 9 weeks of twice-weekly partial body weight-supported treadmill training (PBWSTT) for children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and moderate to severe walking difficulty compared with overground walking. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Metropolitan Specialist School for children with moderate to severe physical and/or intellectual disabilities. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four children classified level III or IV by the Gross Motor Function Classification System were recruited and randomly allocated to experimental or control groups. Of these, 26 (15 girls, 11 boys; mean age 10 y, 10 mo +/- 3 y, 11 mo [range, 5-18 y]) completed training and testing. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups completed 9 weeks of twice-weekly walking training. The experimental group completed PBWSTT, and the control group completed overground walking practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ten-meter walk test (self-selected walking speed), 10-minute walk (walking endurance), School Function Assessment. RESULTS: The overground walking group showed a trend for an increase in the distance walked over 10 minutes (F=3.004, P=.097). There was no statistically significant difference in self-selected walking speed over 10 meters or in walking function in the school environment as measured by the School Function Assessment. CONCLUSIONS: PBWSTT is safe and feasible to implement in a special school setting; however, it may be no more effective than overground walking for improving walking speed and endurance for children with CP. Continued emphasis on progressive reduction of body weight support along with adding concurrent overground walking practice to a treadmill training protocol may increase the intensity of training and assist with carryover of improvements to overground walking. Treadmill training programs that include concurrent overground walking as an additional key feature of the training protocol need to be rigorously evaluated for children with CP.",M1
20226675,"Further evidence of validity of the Gait Deviation Index.In this paper, the relationship of the Gait Deviation Index (GDI) to gross motor function and its ability to distinguish between different Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels was determined. A representative sample of 184 ambulant children with <e>CP</e> in GMFCS levels I (n=57), II (n=91), III (n=22) and IV (n=14) were recruited as part of a population-based study. Representative gait cycles were selected following a 3D gait analysis and gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). GDI scores were calculated in Matlab. Valid 3D kinematic data were obtained for 173 participants and both kinematic and GMFM data were obtained for 150 participants. A substantial relationship between mean GDI and GMFM-66 scores was demonstrated (r=0.70; p&lt;0.001) with significant differences in mean GDI scores between GMFCS levels (p&lt;0.001) indicating increasing levels of gait deviation in subjects less functionally able. The relationship between the GDI, GMFM and GMFCS in a representative sample of ambulators, lends further weight to the validity of the GDI scoring system. Furthermore it suggests that the subtleties of gait may not be wholly accounted for by gross motor function evaluation alone. Gait specific tools such as the GDI more likely capture both the functional and aesthetic components of walking.",M1
20222773,"Virtual reality as a therapeutic modality for children with cerebral palsy.OBJECTIVE: The evidence for using virtual reality (VR) with children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) was examined. METHODS: A search of 13 electronic databases identified all types of studies examining VR as an intervention for children with CP. The most recent article included was published in October 2008. For each study, the quality of the methods was assessed using the appropriate scale. A total of 19 articles were retrieved. Thirteen studies from 11 articles were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Outcomes documented brain reorganization/plasticity, motor capacity, visual-perceptual skills, social participation and personal factors. Two studies were randomized controlled trials. These reported conflicting results regarding motor outcomes. Twelve of the 13 studies presented positive outcomes in at least one domain. CONCLUSIONS: VR has potential benefits for children with CP. However, the current level of evidence is poor and empirical data is lacking. Future methodologically rigorous studies are required.",M1
20222768,"Ambulant children with spastic cerebral palsy and their parents' perceptions and expectations prior to multilevel surgery.PURPOSE: This study explores the pre-operative situation of children accepted for multilevel surgery for cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and their parents. METHODS: Eight ambulatory children with varied severity of spastic CP and their parents were included. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were carried out separately with the children and parents. RESULTS: Everyday life of the children and their parents was vulnerable. The degree to which children strived for social acceptance and normality increased their pain. Deteriorating physical capacity resulted in pain and fatigue and was the parents' and children's main motivation for the operation. Although the parents were ambivalent to the operation they mediated hope and cautious optimism about a better life for their children. CONCLUSION: Parents' and children's experiences imply the need for improvements to ensure facilitation for disabled children in schools and all levels of the health service, equality of communication and awareness-raising in the pre-operative phase of multilevel surgery.",M1
20203376,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of hip adductors improves gait parameters of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Reduction of spasticity in hip adductor muscles is one of the essential factors to improve standing, gait, and personal hygiene of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). Surgical and medical methods have been commonly used for such purposes. These methods are expensive, required special skill and have side effects. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of conventional TENS on spasticity in hip adductors and gait parameters of children with spastic diplegic CP. Subject: An experimental group of twenty seven ambulant children with spastic diplegic CP and control group of fifteen healthy children were voluntary participants in the study. METHODS: The experimental group received two different TENS management programs. The 1st TENS program was a one-time trial management program that included an ongoing application of conventional TENS on bilateral hip adductors during passive hip abduction, and during walking for a pre-determined distance. The 2nd TENS program was a one-week trial management program that included 15 minutes of ongoing application of conventional TENS on bilateral hip adductors during walking, three sessions a day for a week. The effects of the TENS program was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale, the balance master system and visual observations of knee positions. RESULTS: A significant improvement was recorded in spasticity of hip adductors, gait parameters and knees position of the experimental group. CONCLUSION: Functional application of TENS to hip adductors of children with spastic diplegic CP can reduce spasticity and improve gait pattern.",M1
20187888,"Importance of peers and dating in the development of romantic relationships and sexual activity of young adults with cerebral palsy.AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the peer group activities, romantic relationships, and sexual activity and their interrelations of young adults with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed in 87 participants (51 males, 36 females; mean age 20 y 4 mo, SD 1 y 3 mo range age 18-22 y) without cognitive disabilities. Ninety-four per cent had spastic CP and 49% unilateral CP, while 78% were classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System level I and 84% at Manual Ability Classification System level I. Peer group activities, dating, romantic relationships, and sexual activity were assessed with an interview and questionnaire. Associations were analysed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The study cohort reported having friends and participating in activities with peers; 71% had experience of dating, 23% had a current romantic relationship, and 38% had experience of intercourse. Young adults with CP had less experience in romantic and sexual relationships than an age-appropriate Dutch reference population. Peer group activities and dating favoured development of romantic relationships and sexual activity. Older age was associated with greater sexual activity. Motor functioning, education level, and gender did not correlate with romantic relationships or sexual activity. INTERPRETATION: Being involved in peer group activities and creating a context to arrange dates seems relevant for young adults with CP to develop romantic relationships and sexual activity.",M1
20187880,"Correlates of decline in gross motor capacity in adolescents with cerebral palsy in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III to V: an exploratory study.AIM: To explore associations between clinical variables and decline in motor capacity in adolescents with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHOD: Participants included 76 males and 59 females, whose mean age at the beginning of the study was 14 years 6 months (SD 2.4, range 11.6-17.9); 51 at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level III, 47 at level IV, and 37 at level V. Ninety-six participants had tetraplegia, 32 had diplegia, and one had hemiplegia. Types of motor disorder were spastic n=98; mixed, n=11; dystonic, n=9; hypotonic, n=7; and ataxic n=3 (seven participants were not classified). Reliable raters collected data annually for 4 years on anthropometric characteristics, the Spinal Alignment and Range of Motion Measure, as well as the Gross Motor Function Measure, 66 items (GMFM-66); participants or their parents reported on health status (using the Health Utilities Questionnaire), pain, and exercise participation (using measures developed for this study). The predicted drop in GMFM-66 scores after childhood was calculated using data on the same children from an earlier study. Correlations were calculated between the drop in GMFM-66 scores and the average and change scores of the clinical variables (the alpha level for statistical significance of this exploratory study was 0.10). RESULTS: The drop in GMFM-66 score was significantly correlated with limitations in range of motion (r=0.42) and spinal alignment (r=0.28), and pain (r=0.16). Increases in triceps skinfold (r=-0.19), mid-arm circumference (r=-0.23), and the ratio of mid-arm circumference to knee height (r=-0.23) were associated with less decline. INTERPRETATION: Preventing range-of-motion limitations and pain experiences and optimizing nutrition might contribute to less decline in the gross motor capacity of adolescents with CP. Further investigation is required to clarify the role other factors that contribute to maintained function over time.",M1
20187878,"Reliability of kinematic measures of functional reaching in children with cerebral palsy.AIM: The determination of rehabilitation effectiveness in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) depends on the metric properties of the outcome measure. We evaluated the reliability of kinematic measures of functional upper limb reaching movements in children with CP. METHOD: Thirteen children (ten females, three males) with spastic hemiplegic, diplegic, or quadriplegic CP affecting at least one arm (mean age 9y, SD 1.6y; range 6-11y; Manual Ability Classification System [MACS] levels II-IV) were evaluated three times over 5 weeks. The kinematics of the more affected arm reaching to grasp a 2cm(3) block placed at three distances from the body midline were analysed. The reliability (test-retest) of six kinematic variables (endpoint trajectory straightness and smoothness, trunk displacement, elbow extension, shoulder horizontal adduction, and shoulder flexion] was tested and expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, model 2,K) and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Trajectory smoothness, trunk displacement, elbow extension, and shoulder flexion (far target) had the highest ICCs (0.82-0.95). Other kinematic variables had moderate (0.50&lt; or =ICC&lt; or =0.81) or low (0.17-0.38) reliability. Test-retest reliability was task dependent, as reaches required different degrees of trunk displacement and joint excursion. INTERPRETATION: Kinematic variables can be used as outcomes in clinical trials to test upper limb intervention effectiveness on motor performance and movement quality. As kinematic variables are task specific, reliability should be interpreted in the context of task requirements.",M1
20179566,"Static and dynamic gait parameters before and after multilevel soft tissue surgery in ambulating children with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have questioned the efficacy of releasing hip flexion contractures and the resulting ankle position after tendoachilles lengthening in ambulating children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: Twenty-three ambulatory children with CP underwent 96 soft tissue-lengthening procedures without bony surgery. Preoperative and postoperative clinical and computerized gait data were reviewed. RESULTS: Static contractures improved reliably, with improvements in all areas measured, including hip flexion contracture (14 degree improvement), hip abduction (19 degree improvement), popliteal angle (26 degree improvement), and ankle dorsiflexion (11 degree improvement). The changes in computerized gait data were less uniform. The knees showed significant benefits, as evidenced by improved maximal knee extension in stance phase (37.3 degree preop and 19.9 degree postop) and at initial contact (51.6 degree preop and 34.8 degree postop). At the hip, a statistically significant improvement was only seen in maximum hip extension in stance phase (minimum hip flexion), and the magnitude of this change was only 4.6 degree (15.3 to 10.7 degree). There were no significant changes at the pelvis. At the ankle, the tendency was toward calcaneal gait after Achilles tendon lengthening, with excessive dorsiflexion seen both in stance (17.3 degree) and at toe off (-6.9 degree). Tempero-spatial parameters showed improved stride length, but no significant changes in gait velocity or cadence. DISCUSSION: The persistence of crouch postoperatively, though improved, likely limited the potential changes in hip kinematics. As this study excluded patients undergoing osseous surgery, it is possible that lever arm dysfunction may have contributed to the ongoing crouch. The results of this study suggest that static contractures and knee kinematics improve reliably after soft tissue surgery in children with CP, but that caution must be exercised when considering heel cord lengthening in these children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level II. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",M1
20178997,"Ageing with cerebral palsy: psychosocial issues.BACKGROUND: although much has been written about biomedical concerns in adults ageing with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), few studies or reviews have addressed psychosocial aspects. OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this narrative review is to critically examine studies that have addressed needs for social support, as well as issues affecting morale, self-efficacy, health attitudes, employment and sense of coherence (SOC) in adults ageing with CP. DESIGN: a systematic and detailed search of the literature was conducted. METHODS: searches of CINAHL (1982-present), ERIC, PubMed (1950-present), MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science databases, as well as the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine website, were conducted. Key search terms included 'cerebral palsy and ageing', 'adults with cerebral palsy', 'secondary conditions', 'functional loss', 'health' and 'psychosocial'. Nine studies were recovered that described psychosocial consequences of living with a lifespan disability. We used McMaster University's Guidelines for Critical Review Form--Quantitative and Qualitative Studies to evaluate the studies. RESULTS: psychosocial issues of concern to adults ageing with CP include the need for social support, self-acceptance and acceptance by others; the need for accommodations in the workplace and the environment; and SOC of adults ageing with CP. CONCLUSIONS: several studies concluded that adults with CP need greater knowledge and understanding to enhance decision-making processes about their health. The studies reviewed also provide knowledge for healthcare and social service providers who care for adults with CP to better understand how psychosocial health can be preserved during the ageing process.",M1
20163435,"Thickened saliva after effective management of drooling with botulinum toxin A.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheological properties of saliva after submandibular botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections. METHOD: We enrolled 15 children (11 males and six females; age range 3-17 y, mean age 9 y 10 mo) diagnosed with spastic (n=9) or dyskinetic (n=6) quadriplegic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>); Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV or V; and two children with intellectual disability (IQ&lt;70) who experienced moderate to severe drooling. Salivary flow rate and drooling quotient were measured at baseline and at different times after BoNT-A injections up to 24 weeks. The mucin concentration of saliva was analysed before and after BoNT-A treatment. RESULTS: Both submandibular salivary flow rate (baseline 0.38 mL/min; 24 wks after injection 0.26 mL/min) and drooling quotient (baseline 42.5%; 24 wks 28.80%) were substantially reduced, with a concomitant increase in mucin concentration within 8 weeks after BoNT-A injection (from 0.612 to 1.830 U/mL). The parents of nine children observed thickened saliva. Swallowing and chewing were problematic in seven children. Two of these children needed treatment with mucolytics because of pooling of thickened saliva in the throat. INTERPRETATION: When making decisions about the use of BoNT-A, the risk of problems with masticatory and swallowing functions as a result of thickening of saliva after BoNT-A treatment should be taken into account.",M1
20163431,"Predictors of cerebral palsy in very preterm infants: the EPIPAGE prospective population-based cohort study.AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the independent role of cerebral lesions on ultrasound scan, and several other neonatal and obstetric factors, as potential predictors of cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) in a large population-based cohort of very preterm infants. METHOD: As part of EPIPAGE, a population-based prospective cohort study, perinatal data and outcome at 5 years of age were recorded for 1812 infants born before 33 weeks of gestation in nine regions of France in 1997. RESULTS: The study group comprised 942 males (52%) and 870 females with a mean gestational age of 30 weeks (SD 2 wks; range 24-32 wks) and a mean birthweight of 1367 g (SD 393 g; range 450-2645 g). CP was diagnosed at 5 years of age in 159 infants (prevalence 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7-10%), 97 males and 62 females, with a mean gestational age of 29 weeks (SD 2 wks; range 24-32 wks) and a mean birthweight of 1305 g (SD 386 g; range 500-2480 g). Among this group, 67% walked without aid, 14% walked with aid, and 19% were unable to walk. Spastic, ataxic, and dyskinetic CP accounted for 89%, 7%, and 4% of cases respectively. The prevalence of CP was 61% among infants with cystic periventricular leukomalacia, 50% in infants with intraparenchymal haemorrhage, 8% in infants with grade I intraventricular haemorrhage, and 4% in infants without a detectable cerebral lesion. After controlling for cerebral lesions and obstetric and neonatal factors, only male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.03-2.25) and preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labour (OR 1.72; 95% CI 0.95-3.14) were predictors of the development of CP in very preterm infants. INTERPRETATION: Cerebral lesions were the most important predictor of CP in very preterm infants. In addition, infant sex and preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labour were also independent predictors of CP.",M1
20163429,"Walking ability and predictors of performance on the 6-minute walk test in adults with spastic cerebral palsy.AIM: To describe walking ability and identify factors predicting walking capacity in adults with spastic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) assessed with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). METHOD: A cross-sectional clinical study as part of the recruitment process for a randomized controlled trial on the effects of botulinum toxin A. Data analysed were the 6MWT, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Borg Scale, spasticity, muscle strength, popliteal angle, pain, fatigue, type of CP, foot deformity, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels, Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) scores, a gait questionnaire, interview, and demographic data. RESULTS: In total, 126 persons were included (53 males, 73 females; mean age 39 y [SD 12 y]; 59 with unilateral and 67 with bilateral spastic CP; GMFCS level I, n=12; level II, n=94; level III, n=20). Mean distance on the 6MWT was 485 m (SD 95 m) with FMS scores reflecting independent walking performance in daily life. Multiple regression analysis identified sex, type of CP, popliteal angle, pain, and TUG values as significant predictors, with TUG values as the strongest predictor (standardized regression coefficient=-0.57, p&lt;0.001). INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that 39% of the participants had declined one GMFCS level from adolescence to their present age, and that the TUG was the strongest predictor for the 6MWT. This implicates the importance of focusing specifically on the different elements of functional mobility in further studies.",M1
20163428,"Precision and content range of a parent-reported item bank assessing lower extremity and mobility skills in children with cerebral palsy.AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties, content range, and measurement precision of a lower extremity physical functioning and mobility skills item bank (LE85) in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHOD: Lower extremity functioning and mobility skill items were administered to 308 parents of children (169 males, 139 females; mean age 10y 8mo, SD 4y) with spastic CP (145 diplegia, 73 hemiplegia, 89 quadriplegia; [for one person type of CP was unknown]) classified using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (75 level I, 91 level II, 79 level III, 37 level IV, 26 level V). Additional legacy measures were administered to assess concurrent validity. Psychometric characteristics, differential item functioning, content range, and score precision were examined. RESULTS: The LE85 had acceptable psychometric properties. Content range matched the ability range of the sample population and exceeded legacy measures with minimal differential item functioning. The LE85 had good correlation with the Paediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, Functional Independence Measure for Children, Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire, and Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory-CP module (range r=0.63-0.86). Precision of the LE85 and 10-item simulated computer adaptive test scores outperformed legacy measures. INTERPRETATION: The LE85 appears to be suitable to administer as a computer adaptive test to measure lower extremity physical functioning and mobility in children with CP.",M1
20159426,"<e>CP</e> or not CP? A review of diagnoses in a cerebral palsy register.The purpose of this study was to document the inaccuracy rate of diagnosis of cerebral palsy recorded on the South Australian Cerebral Palsy Register. A total of 402 children born in South Australia from 1993 to 2002 and notified to the Register as having cerebral palsy were identified through the Register database, and 21 children (5.2%) were later identified to have a noncerebral palsy diagnosis. Of these, 5 had either a metabolic or a neurodegenerative disorder and 2 had a syndromic disorder (1 Joubert syndrome and 1 Sotos syndrome); the remaining 14 children had one of the following final diagnoses: developmental delay, gross motor delay, perinatal myositis, spinal subdural and subarachnoid arteriovenous malformation, and Erb's palsy. In 16 of 21 children (76%), the diagnosis was changed at 5 years of age or older. Studies based on population registers may need to take into account the possibility of misclassification, estimated to be at least 5.2% in this study. A complete clinical assessment at the time of diagnosis followed by regular reassessment would enable the clinician to exclude children with alternative diagnoses, which has important implications for clinical management and research based on cerebral palsy registers.",M1
20149562,"Heart rate variability in infants with central coordination disturbance.Despite a remarkable medical progress in the field of Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, early identification of infants at risk for permanent motor disabilities still presents challenge for both clinicians and researchers. As an indicator of cardiac autonomic control, it was shown that heart rate variability (HRV) might reflect not only sympathetic or parasympathetic activity but also functional integrity of the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore a pattern of HRV was demonstrated to correlate with motor developmental outcome in high risk infants. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical usefulness as well as predictive value of time-domain HRV parameters in infants with central coordination disturbance. The study included 35 infants with central coordination disturbance and 37 healthy age and sex-matched controls. Time-domain HRV indices were analyzed from 24-h electrocardiography recordings. We found significantly lower values of SDNN, SDANN and RMSSD parameters in infants with central coordination disturbance compared to controls. Additionally, logistic regression analyses demonstrated independent predictive value of parameters SDNN and SDANN in infants who subsequently developed cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). By performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the optimal cut-off value of SDNN&lt;=48ms predicted CP with a sensitivity of 68.7% (95% CI 41.4-88.9) and specificity of 84.2% (95 CI 60.4-96.4) while the optimal cut-off value of SDANN&lt;=41ms predicted CP with a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI 61.6-98.1) and specificity of 57.9% (95 CI 33.5-79.7). We are in opinion that time domain HRV analysis could be helpful clinically as well as a prognostic tool in infants with central coordination disturbance.",M1
20142710,"Pain in children with cerebral palsy: implications for pediatric physical therapy.PURPOSE: This literature review explores pain assessment tools and psychosocial pain management methods that are pertinent to physical therapy (PT) for children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Children with CP experience considerable pain that affects quality of life and cooperation during healthcare procedures. Physical therapist-led research on interventions to address pain in this population is limited, despite evidence for the prevalence of pain during PT interventions, and the preponderance of research supporting the use of psychosocial pain management during other healthcare-related pain-inducing procedures. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE: Research completed primarily by non-physical therapist healthcare professionals delineate assessment tools and psychosocial pain management techniques that hold promise for evaluating and reducing pain that occurs during PT procedures for children with CP.",M1
20142707,"Treadmill responses and physical activity levels of infants at risk for neuromotor delay.PURPOSE: This study described developmental changes in treadmill (TM) stepping and physical activity (PA) of infants at risk for neuromotor delay (ND) and explored these changes by diagnosis of cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). Relationships of stepping and PA with walking onset were examined. METHOD: Fifteen infants at risk for ND (9.9 +/- 2.4 months) were tested every 2 months on a TM until walking onset or 24 months of corrected age. We recorded PA profiles using an activity monitor. Throughout the study, 6 of the 15 infants received a CP diagnosis. RESULTS: Infants increased alternating steps (AltStp), decreased toe contacts, and increased high-level PA. Infants with CP showed less AltStp, more toe contacts, and less high-level PA than those without CP. Infants' AltStp and high-level PA revealed a positive correlation to earlier onset of walking. CONCLUSION: Future studies should examine whether a TM intervention could improve mobility in infants at risk for ND.",M1
20141494,"The combined effect of Dynamic splinting and Neuromuscular electrical stimulation in reducing wrist and elbow contractures in six children with Cerebral palsy.The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of applying the combination of Dynamic splinting (DS) and Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in order to improve wrist and elbow function, and range of motion, in children with upper limb contractures due to Cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). Six children aged seven to 16, with contractures at the wrist or elbow, were recruited. Following a 12-week baseline period all participants underwent a 12-week treatment period where DS was used for one hour per day and combined with NMES for the second half of the 1-h treatment. A 12-week follow-up period then ensued. Upper limb function was assessed with the Melbourne assessment, physical disability with the Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Index and the Activity Scale for Kids, and quality of life with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale. Passive and active range of motion at the wrist and elbow were measured using manual and electrical goniometers. The technique of using combined NMES and DS was demonstrated to be feasible and compliance with the intervention was good. There was an increase in passive elbow extension in two participants treated for elbow contractures, although no accompanying change in upper limb function was demonstrated. Wrist range of movement improved in one participant treated for wrist contracture.",M1
20136471,"Evaluation of single event multilevel surgery and rehabilitation in children and youth with cerebral palsy--A 2-year follow-up study.PURPOSE: This study evaluated multilevel surgery and rehabilitation with functional measures and health related quality of life (HRQOL) of children and youth with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). In addition this study evaluated parent's satisfaction with care. METHOD: A prospective single-subject study with AB design and 2-year follow-up, included 11 children between 8 and 18 years old with CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System I-III. Visual analyses were used to present physical function with Physical Cost Index (PCI). Descriptive statistics were used to present number of children with a clinically important change in Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), self-reported walking ability, and HRQOL with child health questionnaire (CHQ). RESULTS: PCI showed a trend of lower energy cost during gait in six children and GMFM was unchanged for 10 children and improved for one child. Walking ability was improved in 10 children. Gait distance increased in all 11. Both physical and psychosocial dimensions of CHQ improved in six of nine (two missing data). Expectations of outcomes were fulfilled in seven and partly fulfilled in four. Satisfaction with care was fulfilled in 10 of 11. CONCLUSION: Self-reported walking ability improved after multilevel surgery and intensive rehabilitation. This result was partly supported by lower energy cost and improved HRQOL. Expectations and satisfaction were fulfilled for the majority of children.",M1
20132143,"Rating scales for dystonia in cerebral palsy: reliability and validity.AIM: This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (BADS), the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Movement Scale (BFMMS), and the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS) in patients with bilateral dystonic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHOD: Three raters independently scored videotapes of 10 patients (five males, five females; mean age 13 y 3 mo, SD 5 y 2 mo, range 5-22 y). One patient each was classified at levels I-IV in the Gross Motor Function Classification System and six patients were classified at level V. Reliability was measured by (1) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for interrater reliability, (2) standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable difference (SDD), and (3) Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Validity was assessed by Pearson's correlations among the three scales used and by content analysis. RESULTS: Moderate to good interrater reliability was found for total scores of the three scales (ICC: BADS=0.87; BFMMS=0.86; UDRS=0.79). However, many subitems showed low reliability, in particular for the UDRS. SEM and SDD were respectively 6.36% and 17.72% for the BADS, 9.88% and 27.39% for the BFMMS, and 8.89% and 24.63% for the UDRS. High internal consistency was found. Pearson's correlations were high. Content validity showed insufficient accordance with the new CP definition and classification. INTERPRETATION: Our results support the internal consistency and concurrent validity of the scales; however, taking into consideration the limitations in reliability, including the large SDD values and the content validity, further research on methods of assessment of dystonia is warranted.",M1
20132139,"Mechanical properties of the plantarflexor musculotendinous unit during passive dorsiflexion in children with cerebral palsy compared with typically developing children.AIM: To examine the passive length-tension relations in the myotendinous components of the plantarflexor muscles of children with and without cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) under conditions excluding reflex muscle contraction. METHOD: A cross-sectional, non-interventional study was conducted in a hospital outpatient clinic. Passive torque-angle characteristics of the ankle were quantified from full plantarflexion to full available dorsiflexion in 26 independently ambulant children with CP (11 females, 15 males; mean age: 6 y 11 mo, range 4 y 7 mo-9 y 7 mo) and 26 age-matched typically developing children (18 females, 8 males; mean age 7 y 2 mo, range 4 y 1 mo-10 y 4 mo). In the children with CP, the affected (hemiplegia; n=21) or more affected (diplegia; n=5) leg was tested; in typically developing children, the leg tested was randomly selected. Gross Motor Function Classification System levels were I (n=15) and II (n=11). Care was taken to eliminate active or reflex muscle contribution to the movement, confirmed by the absence of electromyographic activity. RESULTS: There were small but significant differences between the two groups for maximum ankle dorsiflexion (p=0.003), but large and significant differences in the torques required to produce the same displacement (p&lt;0.001). Further, the hysteresis of the average loading cycle in the children with CP was over three times that of the typically developing children (p&lt;0.001). INTERPRETATION: We believe that the plantarflexor muscles of children with CP are stiffer and intrinsically more resistant to stretch, even though they retain near normal excursion. This increased stiffness is a non-neurally-mediated feature demonstrated by these children. The extent to which it influences function and predisposes the children to development of soft tissue contracture is unknown.",M1
20132137,"Characterization of spasticity in cerebral palsy: dependence of catch angle on velocity.AIM: To evaluate spasticity under controlled velocities and torques in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) using a manual spasticity evaluator. METHOD: The study involved 10 children with spastic CP (six males, four females; mean age 10 y 1 mo, SD 2 y 9 mo, range 7-16 y; one with quadriplegia, six with right hemiplegia, three with left hemiplegia; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I [n=2], II [n=3], III [n=2], IV [n=2], and V [n=1]; Manual Ability Classification System levels II [n=5], III [n=4], and V [n=1]) and 10 typically developing participants (four males, six females; mean age 10 y 3 mo, SD 2 y 7 mo, range 7-15 y). Spasticity and catch angle were evaluated using joint position, resistance torque, and torque rate at velocities of 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees per second, controlled using real-time audio-visual feedback. Biomechanically, elbow range of motion (ROM), stiffness, and energy loss were determined during slow movement (30 degrees/s) and under controlled terminal torque. RESULTS: Compared with typically developing children, children with CP showed higher reflex-mediated torque (p&lt;0.001) and the torque increased more rapidly with increasing velocity (p&lt;0.001). Catch angle was dependent on velocity and occurred later with increasing velocity (p=0.005). Children with CP showed smaller ROM (p&lt;0.05), greater stiffness (p&lt;0.001), and more energy loss (p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: Spasticity with velocity dependence may also be position-dependent. The delayed catch angle at higher velocities indicates that the greater resistance felt by the examiner at higher velocities was also due to position change, because the joint was moved further to a stiffer position at higher velocities.",M1
20132136,"Effectiveness of functional progressive resistance exercise strength training on muscle strength and mobility in children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of functional progressive resistance exercise (PRE) strength training on muscle strength and mobility in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHOD: Fifty-one children with spastic uni- and bilateral CP; (29 males, 22 females; mean age 10 y 5 mo, SD 1 y 10 mo, range 6 y 0 mo-13 y 10 mo; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I-III) were randomized to the intervention group (n=26) or the control group (n=25, receiving usual care). The intervention group trained for 12 weeks, three times a week, on a five-exercise circuit, which included a leg-press and functional exercises. The training load progressively increased based on the child's maximum level of strength, determined by the eight-repetition maximum. Muscle strength (measured with hand-held dynamometry and a six-repetition maximum leg-press test), mobility (measured with the Gross Motor Function Measure, two functional tests, and a mobility questionnaire), and spasticity (measured by the appearance of a catch) were evaluated before, during, directly after, and 6 weeks after the end of training by two blinded research assistants. RESULTS: Directly after training, there was a statistically significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on muscle strength (knee extensors +12% [0.56 N/kg; 95% confidence interval {CI} 0.13-0.99]; hip abductors +11% [0.27 N/kg; 95% CI 0.00-0.54]; total +8% [1.30 N/kg; 95% CI 0.56-2.54]; six-repetition maximum +14% [14%; 95% CI 1.99-26.35]), but not on mobility or spasticity. A detraining effect was seen after 6 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Twelve weeks of functional PRE strength training increases muscle strength up to 14%. This strength gain did not lead to improved mobility.",M1
20129516,"Robotic gait training in an adult with cerebral palsy: a case report.Improved treatments and rehabilitation for cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) have led to an increased number of children with CP surviving into adulthood. Adults with CP show an increased prevalence of pain, fatigue, and musculoskeletal dysfunction, leading to a decrease in ambulatory function. Recent work has demonstrated the potential benefits of intensive task-specific gait training, including the use of robotic-driven gait orthoses, on motor recovery in children with CP. In contrast, reports of interventions aimed at improving motor function in adults with CP are lacking. This case study reports on the outcomes of a 6-week intervention of robotic-assisted gait training administered to a 52-year-old woman with right hemiplegia attributable to CP. Improvements were noted in balance, walking speed, and time to negotiate stairs at posttraining and follow-up. Gait analysis showed an increase in step length and a reduction in the period of double support. In conclusion, robotic-assisted gait training may be beneficial in enhancing locomotor function in adults with CP.",M1
20123765,"Systematic review of interventions for low bone mineral density in children with cerebral palsy.AIM: To systematically review the efficacy of interventions to improve low bone mineral density (LBMD) in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: We performed a systematic search for published randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of children with CP (aged 0-20 years, all Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] levels) who received various medical and physical interventions for LBMD compared with no intervention or standard care. Study validity was evaluated by using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated when data were sufficient. RESULTS: Eight of 2034 articles met the inclusion criteria (6 RCTs, 2 CCTs). There were 3 trials of bisphosphonates, one of which (Henderson RC, Lark RK, Kecskemethy HH, Miller F, Harcke HT, Bachrach SJ. J Pediatr. 2002;141[5]:644-651) revealed a large and significant effect on BMD in 1 of 3 sites in the distal femur (SMD: 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52-3.24]). There were 3 trials of weight-bearing through varying approaches, one of which (Caulton JM, Ward KA, Alsop CW, Dunn G, Adams JE, Mughal MZ. Arch Dis Child. 2004;89[2]:131-135) showed a large and significant effect on the lumbar spine when increasing static standing time (SMD: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.21-1.85]). The administration of vitamin D and calcium produced a large, nonsignificant effect on BMD in the lumbar spine (Jekovec-Vrhovsek M, Kocijancic A, Prezelj J. Dev Med Child Neurol. 2000;42[6]:403-405) (SMD: 0.88 [95% CI: -0.07 to 1.84). Growth hormone combined with vitamin D and/or calcium resulted in effects comparable with vitamin D and/or calcium on BMD in the lumbar spine (Ali O, Shim M, Fowler E, et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2007;92[3]:932-937) (SMD 0 [95% CI: -1.24 to 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: Important effects on LBMD have been observed in small and diverse cohorts of children with CP. It is unclear whether small sample sizes or variable treatment responses account for nonsignificant findings. Additional large RCTs are needed of both physical and medical approaches.",M1
20120414,"Risk factors associated with cerebral palsy in newborns.The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors associated with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). For this purpose, a total of 55 newborns were investigated in the case control design study, with a total of 55 additional newborns that were matched to the cases. All patients were recruited in University Clinical Hospital Mostar and other institutions in the region between 1997-2005. The comparison of the Apgar score did not seem to show significant differences between cases and controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.36-3.69). Hypoxia was more common in the CP group (36.3% vs. 5.4% in the control group; p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, cases were more frequently exposed to the infections (p &lt; 0.001), intracranial hemorrhage (p = 0.002), premature delivery, before the 28th gestation week ( p = 0.027), as well as the premature delivery during the 28-34 gestation week ( p = 0.001), and 34-38 gestation week ( p = 0.018). Accordingly, small birth weight was associated with cases more often than controls (p = 0.003). Bleeding during pregnancy was also more common in cases than controls (p = 0.032), while the breech presentation, emergency cesarean section, hydrocephalus, placenta disorders and pre-eclampsia were not associated with CP. The results suggest that CP cases were more commonly exposed to numerous risks, which all seem to contribute to the increased chances of PF. Traditional indicator, poor Apgar score was not found to be significantly associated with the CP.",M1
20120401,"Cerebral palsy: early diagnosis, intervention and risk factors.Early diagnosis and intervention intensity were suggested to be crucial factor in cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) treatment. Herein we observed 347 children diagnosed for CP in Clinical Hospital Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and studied the relationship between (a) intervention start point and the final motor outcome, (b) intensity of treatment and final outcome, and (c) relationship between documented risk factors and early diagnosis of the CP. Our study suggests that it is possible to relatively accurately diagnose the CP in the first trimester. Previous miscarriages, sepsis and intracerebral haemorrhage were significantly related to early diagnosis, while delivery outcome, RDS, premature birth, intracerebral haemorrhage, sepsis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and convulsions were found as significantly related to final motor CP outcome. We have found no significant influence of the intervention intensity and final diagnosis. Our results support the idea that the intervention start point has to be considered as one of the most important factors for the effective intervention program. In future studies dealing with the CP interventions and risk factors, special attention should be paid to homogeneity and size of the sample, as well as necessity of including the non-treated controls in the investigation.",M1
20107180,"Profile of refractive errors in cerebral palsy: impact of severity of motor impairment (GMFCS) and <e>CP</e> subtype on refractive outcome.PURPOSE: To describe refractive status in children and young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and relate refractive error to standardized measures of type and severity of CP impairment and to ocular dimensions. METHODS: A population-based sample of 118 participants aged 4 to 23 years with CP (mean 11.64 +/- 4.06) and an age-appropriate control group (n = 128; age, 4-16 years; mean, 9.33 +/- 3.52) were recruited. Motor impairment was described with the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS), and subtype was allocated with the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE). Measures of refractive error were obtained from all participants and ocular biometry from a subgroup with CP. RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence and magnitude of refractive error was found in the CP group compared to the control group. Axial length and spherical refractive error were strongly related. This relation did not improve with inclusion of corneal data. There was no relation between the presence or magnitude of spherical refractive errors in CP and the level of motor impairment, intellectual impairment, or the presence of communication difficulties. Higher spherical refractive errors were significantly associated with the nonspastic CP subtype. The presence and magnitude of astigmatism were greater when intellectual impairment was more severe, and astigmatic errors were explained by corneal dimensions. Conclusions. High refractive errors are common in CP, pointing to impairment of the emmetropization process. Biometric data support this CONCLUSION: In contrast to other functional vision measures, spherical refractive error is unrelated to CP severity, but those with nonspastic CP tend to demonstrate the most extreme errors in refraction.",M1
20104161,"Outcomes of gastrocnemius-soleus complex lengthening for isolated equinus contracture in children with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: The goal of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex (GSC) lengthenings in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is to achieve a plantigrade foot and normalize kinematics during gait. The study purpose was to evaluate the results of GSC lengthening for isolated equinus contracture in individuals with CP. It was hypothesized that GSC lengthenings would normalize passive ankle range of motion, kinematic, kinetic, and temporal spatial parameters. METHODS: Gait data from 15 able-bodied participants from the laboratory normal database and passive range of motion, kinematic, kinetic, and temporal spatial gait parameters, and oxygen cost were collected and analyzed for 27 individuals with CP (36 limbs) with isolated equinus contracture who received GSC lengthenings. Data were compared between preoperative and postoperative assessments. RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 11.4 years (+/-3.2 y). Mean time between surgery and postoperative gait analysis was 1.3 years (+/-0.3 y). Passive range of motion measurements were obtained. Kinematic and kinetic data for the hip, knee and ankle, and temporal spatial parameters were obtained from a representative gait trial preoperatively and postoperatively. Paired t tests (P&lt;0.05) determined whether preoperative data differed from postoperative data or from able-bodied data. The passive range of motion at the ankle was improved and normalized postoperatively. Ankle kinematics normalized without compensatory changes occurring at the knee or hip kinematics. Ankle moments and powers become more normal but did not completely normalize. Kinematics and kinetics of the hip and knee were not adversely affected. No changes in the temporal spatial data or oxygen cost occurred postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the finding that with appropriate patient selection isolated GSC lengthening does not result in overcorrection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective comparative study; level 3.",M1
20103409,"The health and quality of life outcomes among youth and young adults with cerebral palsy.Young NL, Rochon TG, McCormick A, Law M, Wedge JH, Fehlings D. The health and quality of life outcomes among youth and young adults with cerebral palsy. OBJECTIVES: To describe the health and quality of life (QoL) of youth and young adults who have cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), and to assess the impact of 3 key factors (severity, age, and sex) on these outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Participants were identified from 6 children's treatment centers in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: The sample of participants (N=199) included youth (n=129; age, 13-17y) and adults (n=70; age, 23-33y) with a broad range of severity: 35% mild, 19% moderate, and 47% severe. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health Utilities Index (HUI(3)), Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL), and Self-Rated Health (SRH). RESULTS: SRH was reported to be excellent or very good by 57% of youth and 46% of adults. Mean HUI(3) scores were .30 for youth and .31 for adults. Mean AQoL scores were .28 for youth and adults. Severity of CP in childhood predicted 55% of the variance in HUI(3) scores and 45% of the variance in AQoL scores. Age and sex were not significant predictors of health or QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The observed health and QoL scores were much lower than those previously reported in the literature. This is likely a result of the inclusion of those with severe CP. The scores for youth were similar to those for adults and suggest that health and QoL outcomes were relatively stable across the transition to adulthood. Youth and adults with CP have limited health status and will require health care support throughout their lives to help them optimize their well being. Longitudinal follow-up studies are essential to understand better the patterns of health in this population over time.",M1

20093327,"Pediatric endurance and limb strengthening (PEDALS) for children with cerebral palsy using stationary cycling: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Effective interventions to improve and maintain strength (force-generating capacity) and endurance are needed for children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to examine the effects of a stationary cycling intervention on muscle strength, locomotor endurance, preferred walking speed, and gross motor function in children with spastic diplegic CP. DESIGN: This was a phase I randomized controlled trial with single blinding. SETTING: The interventions were performed in community-based outpatient physical therapy clinics. Outcome assessments were performed in university laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two ambulatory children aged 7 to 18 years with spastic diplegic CP and Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I to III participated in this study. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants were randomly assigned to cycling or control (no-intervention) groups. Thirty intervention sessions occurred over 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were peak knee extensor and flexor moments, the 600-Yard Walk-Run Test, the Thirty-Second Walk Test, and the Gross Motor Function Measure sections D and E (GMFM-66). RESULTS: Significant baseline-postintervention improvements were found for the 600-Yard Walk-Run Test, the GMFM-66, peak knee extensor moments at 120 degrees /s, and peak knee flexor moments at 30 degrees /s for the cycling group. Improved peak knee flexor moments at 120 degrees/s were found for the control group only, although not all participants could complete this speed of testing. Significant differences between the cycling and control groups based on change scores were not found for any outcomes. Limitations Heterogeneity of the patient population and intrasubject variability were limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements in locomotor endurance, gross motor function, and some measures of strength were found for the cycling group but not the control group, providing preliminary support for this intervention. As statistical differences were not found in baseline-postintervention change scores between the 2 groups; the results did not demonstrate that stationary cycling was more effective than no intervention. The results of this phase I study provide guidance for future research.",M1
20091546,"Botulinum toxin A as an adjunct to treatment in the management of the upper limb in children with spastic cerebral palsy (UPDATE).BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is  a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation(s) that are attributed to non-progressive disturbance that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain  (Rosenbaum 2007, p.9). The spastic motor type is the most common form of CP. Therapeutic management may include splinting/casting, passive stretching, facilitation of posture/movement, spasticity-reducing medication and surgery. Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) is now used as an adjunct to these techniques in an attempt to reduce spasticity, improve range of movement and function. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of injections of BoNT-A or BoNT-A and occupational therapy in the treatment of the upper limb in children with CP. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register/CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August Week 1 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 28) and CINAHL (1982 to August Week 1 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BoNT-A injection or BoNT-A injection and occupational therapy in the upper limb(s) with other types of treatment (including no treatment or placebo) in children with CP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors using standardised forms extracted the data independently. Each trial was assessed for internal validity and rated for quality using the PEDro scale. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan 5.0.15. MAIN RESULTS: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. PEDro quality ratings ranged from 6/10 to 10/10. Concentration of BoNT-A ranged from 50U/1.0ml to 200U/1.0ml saline with doses of 0.5U to 16U/kg body weight and total doses of 220 to 410 Units (Botox(R)).A combination of BoNT-A and occupational therapy is more effective than occupational therapy alone in reducing impairment, improving activity level outcomes and goal achievement, but not for improving quality of life or perceived self-competence. When compared with placebo or no treatment, there is moderate evidence that BoNT-A alone is not effective. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found high level evidence supporting the use of BoNT-A as an adjunct to managing the upper limb in children with spastic CP. BoNT-A should not be used in isolation but should be accompanied by planned occupational therapy.Further research is essential to identify children most likely to respond to BoNT-A injections, monitor longitudinal outcomes, determine timing and effect of repeated injections and the most effective dosage, dilution and volume schedules. The most effective adjunct therapies including frequency and intensity of delivery also requires investigation.",M1
20067354,"Description of a multifaceted rehabilitation program including overground gait training for a child with cerebral palsy: A case report.This case describes the outcomes of a multifaceted rehabilitation program including body weight-supported overground gait training (BWSOGT) in a nonambulatory child with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and the impact of this treatment on the child's functional mobility. The patient is a nonambulatory 10-year-old female with CP who during an inpatient rehabilitation stay participated in direct, physical therapy 6 days per week for 5 weeks. Physical therapy interventions included stretching of her bilateral lower extremities, transfer training, bed mobility training, balance training, kinesiotaping, supported standing in a prone stander, two trials of partial weight-supported treadmill training, and for 4 weeks, three to five times per week, engaged in 30 minutes of BWSOGT using the Up n' go gait trainer, Lite Gait Walkable, and Rifton Pacer gait trainer. Following the multifaceted rehabilitation program, the patient demonstrated increased step initiation, increased weight bearing through bilateral lower extremities, improved bed mobility, and increased participation in transfers. The child's Gross Motor Functional Measure (GMFM) scores increased across four dimensions and her Physical Abilities and Mobility Scale (PAMS) increased significantly. This case report illustrates that a multifaceted rehabilitation program including BWSOGT was an effective intervention strategy to improve functional mobility in this nonambulatory child with CP.",M1
20067351,"Occurrence of gross motor behaviors and attainment of motor objectives in children with cerebral palsy participating in conductive education.This exploratory study investigated the frequency of occurrence of gross motor behaviors by nine children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) participating in an 11-month conductive education (CE) program and the attainment of their gross motor objectives. The intervention team determined gross motor objectives for each child. Activities to achieve those objectives were fully integrated into the child's daily routines. Interval by interval recording was used to observe eight stability, seven mobility, and six transfer behaviors during four school days for each child. The interrater reliability using a kappa statistic was 0.73-0.93 for the observed behaviors. An independent evaluator determined that the children achieved 83% of their gross motor objectives for the first term and 89% for the second term of the year. Of the objectives initially not achieved, three related to stair climbing, an activity not observed being practiced. Stability behaviors, mainly sitting, occurred at substantially higher rates than all mobility and transfer behaviors. All stability and transfer objectives that were practiced were achieved. The children spent the majority of their day in sitting. While the children achieved the majority of their motor objectives, the limited active mobility seen in this and other preschools warrants further investigation.",M1
20067345,"Distribution of contractures and spinal malalignments in adolescents with cerebral palsy: observations and influences of function, gender and age.OBJECTIVE: To describe distributions of contracture and spinal malalignment in adolescents with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and determine associations with age, gender and function. METHODS: Data were collected using the Spinal Alignment and Range of Motion Measure (SAROMM), the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Activity Scale for Kids (ASK). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five adolescents (122 males; mean age 14 years 8 months; SD 1 year 8 months) participated. SAROMM scores by GMFCS levels and item scores in various body regions are presented. Correlations between indices of function and SAROMM total score were &gt;0.70 (p&lt;0.001). Males in GMFCS levels I/V obtained higher total SAROMM scores than females. Age was significantly associated with SAROMM scores for GMFCS levels IV/V participants. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide benchmarks for evaluating impairments in adolescents with CP and support the role of function in contracture development and possibly prevention. Gender and age were factors that modified outcomes.",M1
20064275,"INCITE: A randomised trial comparing constraint induced movement therapy and bimanual training in children with congenital hemiplegia.BACKGROUND: Congenital hemiplegia is the most common form of cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) accounting for 1 in 1300 live births. These children have limitations in capacity to use the impaired upper limb and bimanual coordination deficits which impact on daily activities and participation in home, school and community life. There are currently two diverse intensive therapy approaches. Traditional therapy has adopted a bimanual approach (BIM training) and recently, constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has emerged as a promising unimanual approach. Uncertainty remains about the efficacy of these interventions and characteristics of best responders. This study aims to compare the efficacy of CIMT to BIM training to improve outcomes across the ICF for school children with congenital hemiplegia. METHODS/DESIGN: A matched pairs randomised comparison design will be used with children matched by age, gender, side of hemiplegia and level of upper limb function. Based on power calculations a sample size of 52 children (26 matched pairs) will be recruited. Children will be randomised within pairs to receive either CIMT or BIM training. Both interventions will use an intensive activity based day camp model, with groups receiving the same dosage of intervention delivered in the same environment (total 60 hours over 10 days). A novel circus theme will be used to enhance motivation. Groups will be compared at baseline, then at 3, 26 and 52 weeks following intervention. Severity of congenital hemiplegia will be classified according to brain structure (MRI and white matter fibre tracking), cortical excitability using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), functional use of the hand in everyday tasks (Manual Ability Classification System) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Outcomes will address neurovascular changes (functional MRI, functional connectivity), and brain (re)organisation (TMS), body structure and function (range of motion, spasticity, strength and sensation), activity limitations (upper limb unimanual capacity and bimanual motor coordination), participation restrictions (in home, school and recreation), environmental (barriers and facilitators to participation) and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This paper outlines the theoretical basis, study hypotheses and outcome measures for a matched pairs randomised trial comparing CIMT and BIM training to improve outcomes across the ICF.

20059508,"Enabling self-directed computer use for individuals with cerebral palsy: a systematic review of assistive devices and technologies.AIM: The purpose of this study was to systematically review published evidence on the development, use, and effectiveness of devices and technologies that enable or enhance self-directed computer access by individuals with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: Nine electronic databases were searched using keywords 'computer', 'software', 'spastic', 'athetoid', and 'cerebral palsy'; the reference lists of articles thus identified were also searched. Thirty articles were selected for review, with 23 reports of development and usability testing of devices and seven evaluations of algorithms to increase computer recognition of input and cursor movements. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies had fewer than 10 participants with CP, with a wide age range of 5 to 77 years. Computer task performance was usually tested, but only three groups sought participant feedback on ease and comfort of use. International standards exist to evaluate effectiveness of non-keyboard devices, but only one group undertook this testing. None of the study designs were higher than American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine level IV. INTERPRETATION: Access solutions for individuals with CP are in the early stages of development. Future work should include assessment of end-user comfort, effort, and performance as well as design features. Engaging users and therapists when designing and evaluating technologies to enhance computer access may increase acceptance and improve performance.",M1
20056377,"Cognitive modifiability of children with developmental disabilities: a multicentre study using Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment--Basic program.The study aimed at exploring the effectiveness of cognitive intervention with the new  Instrumental Enrichment Basic  program (IE-basic), based on Feuerstein's theory of structural cognitive modifiability that contends that a child's cognitive functioning can be significantly modified through mediated learning intervention. The IE-basic progam is aimed at enhancing domain-general cognitive functioning in a number of areas (systematic perception, self-regulation abilities, conceptual vocabulary, planning, decoding emotions and social relations) as well as transferring learnt principles to daily life domains. Participants were children with DCD, <e>CP</e>, intellectual impairment of genetic origin, autistic spectrum disorder, ADHD or other learning disorders, with a mental age of 5-7 years, from Canada, Chile, Belgium, Italy and Israel. Children in the experimental groups (N=104) received 27-90 h of the program during 30-45 weeks; the comparison groups (N=72) received general occupational and sensory-motor therapy. Analysis of the pre- to post-test gain scores demonstrated significant (p&lt;0.05) advantage of experimental over comparison groups in three WISC-R subtests ( Similarities ,  Picture Completion ,  Picture Arrangement ) and Raven Coloured Matrices. Effect sizes ranged from 0.3 to 0.52. Results suggest that it is possible to improve cognitive functioning of children with developmental disability. No advantage was found for children with specific aetiology. Greater cognitive gains were demonstrated by children who received the program in an educational context where all teachers were committed to the principles of mediated learning.",M1
20055573,"Course of health-related quality of life in 9-16-year-old children with cerebral palsy: associations with gross motor abilities and mental health.PURPOSE: To chart the 3-year course of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 9--13-year-old children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), and to determine its relationship with gross motor abilities and mental health. METHODS: Children (n = 91; 58 boys, mean age 11 years, age ranging from 8 years and 6 months to 13 years and 8 months) and parents were assessed annually with the TNO-AZL questionnaires for children's health-related quality of life as a dependent variable, and the gross motor function measure for children with CP and the child behaviour check list as independent variables. Results: The children reported lower HRQoL compared with children in the general population, but reported a higher HRQoL than their parents. The HRQoL remained fairly stable over the 3 years, except for an increase in the autonomy domain. The HRQOL was moderately associated with gross motor abilities, and negatively associated with internalising mental health problems. Externalising problems were only negatively associated with parent-reported HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CP are more resilient and positive about their HRQoL than their parents think they are. In general, mental health in children with CP appeared to be important in understanding their perceived QoL, in addition to the severity of the CP itself.",M1
20042475,"Effects of magnesium sulphate on intraoperative neuromuscular blocking agent requirements and postoperative analgesia in children with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effects of magnesium sulphate on neuromuscular blocking agent requirements and analgesia in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: We randomly divided 61 children with CP undergoing orthopaedic surgery into two groups. The magnesium group (Group M) received magnesium sulphate 50 mg kg(-1) i.v. as a bolus and 15 mg kg(-1) h(-1) by continuous infusion during the operation. The control group (Group S) received the same amount of isotonic saline. Rocuronium was administered 0.6 mg kg(-1) before intubation and 0.1 mg kg(-1) additionally when train-of-four counts were 2 or more. I.V. fentanyl and ketorolac were used to control postoperative pain. Total infused analgesic volumes and pain scores were evaluated at postoperative 30 min, and at 6, 24, and 48 h. RESULTS: The rocuronium requirement of Group M was significantly less than that of Group S [0.29 (0.12) vs 0.42 (0.16) mg kg(-1) h(-1), P&lt;0.05]. Cumulative analgesic consumption in Group M was significantly less after operation at 24 and 48 h (P&lt;0.05), and pain scores in Group M were lower than in Group S during the entire postoperative period (P&lt;0.05). Serum magnesium concentrations in Group M were higher until 24 h after operation (P&lt;0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and rescue drug injections was similar in the two groups. No shivering or adverse effects related to hypermagnesaemia were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: I.V. magnesium sulphate reduces rocuronium requirements and postoperative analgesic consumption in children with CP.",M1

In hopes that this understanding can lead to a standardized and effective physical therapy treatment of CP STS movements. DESIGN: The subjects were 50 children with CP, aged from three years and two months to twelve years and four months, mean age nine years and eleven months. The control group consisted of ten healthy children, aged from four years and five months to eleven years and ten months, mean age seven years and two months. In the analysis, firstly, pictures of the subjects' (CP and control group) STS movements were taken from the side with one digital video camera. Next, these STS movements were classified into two phases (first phase, sitting position to hip off the seat; second phase, hip off the seat to standing position), and the state of the subjects' extremities was evaluated by 15 items. Based on these 15 items, characteristics of STS movements were identified and recorded as YES or NO. Finally, using SPSS (version13), cluster analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The subjects' STS movements were classified into five aggregate groups. CONCLUSION: From these findings, it was possible to distinguish the characteristics and differences of STS movements in healthy children and CP subjects. Moreover, the CP subjects were also able to be classified into four groups based on their shared characteristics of STS movements.",M1
20035642,"Follow-up of developmental profiles in children with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in the developmental profiles of children with spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). Additionally, the relationship of developmental functions between the initial and final stages was determined. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled forty-six children with SQ CP between 2-6 years old and assessed their developmental profiles using the Chinese Child Developmental Inventory on the initial and final assessments. The interval between two assessments was 1.0 +/- 0.3 years. Eight developmental domains, including gross motor, fine motor, expressive language, concept comprehension, situation comprehension, self help, personal social and general development, were evaluated and qualified by the development quotient (DQ). The DQ change index (%) was calculated to evaluate the differences in each domain between the two assessments. The paired t test was used to compare differences in each domain between the two assessments. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship of each domain between the final and initial assessments. RESULTS: Children with SQ CP had lower DQs than normal children in all developmental functions on both assessments (23 - 66%). The DQ distributions were lowest in the gross motor and self help domains, higher in the fine motor, situation comprehension, and personal social domains, and highest in the expressive language, concept comprehension, and general development domains. Except for the fine motor and concept comprehension domains, the DQs of the developmental functions were significantly decreased on the final assessment (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest preschool children with SQ CP had impairments in the full spectrum of developmental profiles. The course of developmental profiles evolves with age.

The Shriners Hospitals for Children CP-CAT battery includes upper-extremity skills, lower-extremity and mobility skills, activity, and global physical health. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 91 children with CP who were tested cross-sectionally and 27 children with CP who were administered the CP-CAT programs twice within approximately a 1-month interval. We examined the concurrent validity of the 4 Shriners Hospitals for Children CP-CAT programs by Pearson correlations with comparative parent-report instruments. The scale reliability was tested by developing estimates of marginal reliability; test-retest reliability was assessed by intraclass correlations. RESULTS: Pearson correlations were moderate to high in matching content domains of the CATs with the comparison measures. Marginal reliability estimates were always better for the CAT program than the comparative instruments. Average test-retest reliability using Intraclass correlations across the 4 CATs was ICC3,1=0.91 with a range of 0.88 to 0.94. CONCLUSIONS: We found the CAT scores to be related to expected domains from external instruments, to have good scale reliability, and to have stable scores as determined by test-retest reliability. These results support the use of parent-report CATs in the assessment of physical functioning in children with CP.",M1
20022999,"Can strength training predictably improve gait kinematics? A pilot study on the effects of hip and knee extensor strengthening on lower-extremity alignment in cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Computer simulations have demonstrated that excessive hip and knee flexion during gait, as frequently seen in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), can reduce the ability of muscles to provide antigravity support and increase the tendency of hip muscles to internally rotate the thigh. These findings suggest that therapies for improving upright posture during gait also may reduce excessive internal rotation. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether strength training can diminish the degree of crouched, internally rotated gait in children with spastic diplegic CP. DESIGN: This was a pilot prospective clinical trial. METHODS: Eight children with CP participated in an 8-week progressive resistance exercise program, with 3-dimensional gait analysis and isokinetic testing performed before and after the program. Secondary measures included passive range of motion, the Ashworth Scale, and the PedsQL CP Module. To identify factors that may have influenced outcome, individual and subgroup data were examined for patterns of change within and across variables. RESULTS: Strength (force-generating capacity) increased significantly in the left hip extensors, with smaller, nonsignificant mean increases in the other 3 extensor muscle groups, yet kinematic and functional outcomes were inconsistent. The first reported subject-specific computer simulations of crouch gait were created for one child who showed substantial benefit to examine the factors that may have contributed to this outcome. LIMITATIONS: The sample was small, with wide variability in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Strength training may improve walking function and alignment in some patients for whom weakness is a major contributor to their gait deficits. However, in other patients, it may produce no change or even undesired outcomes. Given the variability of outcomes in this and other strengthening studies in CP, analytical approaches to determine the sources of variability are needed to better identify those individuals who are most likely to benefit from strengthening.",M1
20015495,"Joint moment contributions to swing knee extension acceleration during gait in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy.Inadequate peak knee extension during the swing phase of gait is a major deficit in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). The biomechanical mechanisms responsible for knee extension have not been thoroughly examined in CP. The purpose of this study was to assess the contributions of joint moments and gravity to knee extension acceleration during swing in children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Six children with spastic hemiplegic CP were recruited (age=13.4+/-4.8 years). Gait data were collected using an eight-camera system. Induced acceleration analysis was performed for each limb during swing. Average joint moment and gravity contributions to swing knee extension acceleration were calculated. Total swing and stance joint moment contributions were compared between the hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic limbs using paired t-tests (p&lt;0.05). Swing limb joint moment contributions from the hemiplegic limb decelerated swing knee extension significantly more than those of the non-hemiplegic limb and resulted in significantly reduced knee extension acceleration. Total stance limb joint moment contributions were not statistically different. Swing limb joint moment contributions that decelerated knee extension appeared to be the primary cause of inadequate knee extension acceleration during swing. Stance limb muscle strength did not appear to be the limiting factor in achieving adequate knee extension in children with CP. Recent research has shown that the ability to extend the knee during swing is dependent on the selective voluntary motor control of the limb. Data from individual participants support this concept.",M1
20015250,"Cerebral palsy and assisted reproductive technologies: a case-control study.AIM: To determine whether assisted reproductive technologies (ART) were more likely to be the method of conception in singletons with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) than in those without CP. METHOD: Singletons with CP born between 1991 and 2004 were selected from the Victorian Cerebral Palsy Register and matched for birth year to two singletons randomly selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection Unit. Data from both sources were linked to records from three ART centres. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between CP and aspects of conception using ART. Multivariate models were adjusted for parity, previous miscarriages, sex, gestational age, birthweight, and weight for gestational age. RESULTS: We identified 1241 singletons with CP (males n=721 [58%], females n=420 [42/100]; motor type: spastic [87%; unilateral 37%; bilateral 63%], ataxic n=60 [5/100], dyskinetic n=46 [4/100], hypotonic n=29 [2/100], unknown n=25 [2/100]. Gross Motor Function Classification System levels were I n=363 [29/100], II n=297 [24/100], III n=137 [11/100], IV n=160 [13/100], V n=192 [15/100], and unknown n=92 [7/100]). Sixteen (1.3/100) of the children with CP and 25 (1.0/100) of 2482 children without CP were conceived using ART. There was no significant increase in the odds of children with CP being conceived using ART (adjusted odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 2.24) nor in the odds of them being conceived by a subfertile couple without ART (adjusted odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 0.87, 8.36). INTERPRETATION: Singleton conception using ART is not strongly associated with an increased risk of CP.",M1
20003101,"Pain in children with cerebral palsy: a cross-sectional multicentre European study.AIM: To determine the prevalence and associations of self-reported and parent-reported pain in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) of all severities. METHOD: Cross-sectional design using a questionnaire; analysis using ordinal regression. Children aged 8-12 years were randomly selected from population-based registers of children with CP in eight European regions; a further region recruited 75 children from multiple sources. Outcome measures were pain in the previous week among children who could self-report and parents' perception of their child's pain in the previous 4 weeks. RESULTS: Data on pain were available from 490 children who could self-report and parents of 806 children (those who could and could not self-report). The estimated population prevalence of self-reported pain in the previous week was 60% (95% CI: 54-65%) and that of parent-reported pain in the previous 4 weeks was 73% (95% CI: 69-76%). In self-reporting children, older children reported more pain but pain was not significantly associated with severity of impairment. In parent reports, severity of child impairment, seizures and parental unemployment were associated with more frequent and severe pain. CONCLUSION: Pain in children with CP is common. Clinicians should enquire about pain and consider appropriate physical, therapeutic or psychological management.",M1
20002130,"Apolipoprotein E genotype and cerebral palsy.AIM: Apolipoprotein E (APOE, protein; [ApoE, gene]) is a lipid transport protein abundantly present in brain cells. We investigated whether the APOE genotype is associated with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and whether patients with CP with comorbid conditions and more severe neurological deficits are likely to have a particular genotype. METHOD: In a cross-sectional study, 243 individuals with spastic CP (135 males, 108 females; mean age at data collection 11 year ([SD 6y 7mo], 34% with hemiplegia, 37% with diplegia, 29% with triplegia/tetraplegia; 44% with mild motor involvement), 31% with moderate motor involvement, 25% with severe motor involvement, were compared with healthy individuals matched by age, race, and sex to analyse the association between APOE genotype and the incidence of CP. Associations between the APOE genotype and the incidence of comorbidities and neurological deficits were studied in the group with CP. RESULTS: The APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype was significantly more prevalent in the group with CP (11%) than the comparison group (5%) (odds ratio [OR] 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-7.66). The presence of the epsilon2 allele raised the probability of having CP (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.27-8.27). The presence of ApoE epsilon4 was not significantly different among groups. No relation was found between APOE genotype and severity of neurological deficit or distribution of motor involvement. Four patients with CP presented the epsilon4epsilon4 genotype, and all exhibited epilepsy and microcephaly. Eleven of 12 individuals with CP and macrocephaly carried the epsilon3epsilon3 genotype. INTERPRETATION: A higher prevalence of the APOE epsilon2 genotype was found among those with CP. The association of microcephaly and epilepsy with the epsilon4epsilon4 genotype and the association of macrocephaly with epsilon3 demand further investigation.",M1
20002127,"Leisure activity preferences for 6- to 12-year-old children with cerebral palsy.AIM: The objective was to describe leisure activity preferences of children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and their relationship to participation. Factors associated with greater interest in leisure activities were identified. METHOD: Fifty-five school-aged children (36 males, 19 females; mean age 9 y 11 mo; range 6 y 1 mo-12 y 11 mo) with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS]) level I 62%, level II 22%, level III-IV 16%; 33.3% hemiplegia, 29.6% diplegia, 25.9% quadriplegia, 11.2% other) who could complete the Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) were recruited. RESULTS: Social and recreational activities were most preferred, and self-improvement activities were least preferred. Younger age, higher motivation, and IQ predicted interest in active-physical activities (r(2)=0.39). Negative reaction to failure was associated with less preference for social activities (r(2)=0.16), whereas increased prosocial behaviours were related to greater preference for recreational (r(2)=0.13) and self-improvement activities; the latter is also predicted by older age (r(2)=0.24). Interest in skill-based activities was greater in females and in children who were highly motivated, younger, and had greater motor limitations (r(2)=0.51). The findings suggest that personal factors and functional abilities influence leisure activity preferences. High preference for certain activities was not always associated with involvement in these activities. INTERPRETATION: Determination of preferences is inherent to child-centred practice and should, therefore, be part of the evaluation process. Rehabilitation strategies can minimize barriers to leisure participation, such as fear of failure, low motivation, or environmental obstacles.",M1
20002117,"Attentional and executive impairments in children with spastic cerebral palsy.AIM: Children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) are reported to have learning and social problems. The aim of the present study was to examine whether children with CP have impairments in attention or executive function. METHOD: We examined attention and executive function with standardized neuropsychological measures in a group of children with unilateral (n=15) or bilateral (n=18) spastic CP (14 females, 19 males, mean age 11y 4mo, SD 1y 1mo, range 9y 1mo-13y 7mo; Gross Motor Function Classification System level I n=22, II n=3, III n=6, and IV n=2). Performance was compared with test norms. RESULTS: Verbal cognitive functioning fell within the normal range, whereas sustained (p=0.001) and divided attention (p&lt;0.001) were found to be impaired. Greater impairment was observed in executive function in general (p&lt;0.001) and in inhibition (p=0.038) and shifting (p&lt;0.001) in particular. No significant difference was found between types of CP (unilateral and bilateral). Performance of all timed tasks was slower than the test norm (p&lt;0.00). INTERPRETATION: The finding of slower performances across tasks may indicate a general impairment in efficiency of information processing in relation to white-matter lesions. Impairments in attention and executive functions are present in children with CP and may help to explain why these children have increased social and learning problems.",M1
19969173,"Measuring what matters in cerebral palsy: a breadth of important domains and outcome measures.Vargus-Adams JN, Martin LK. Measuring what matters in cerebral palsy: a breadth of important domains and outcome measures. OBJECTIVE: To establish domains of importance for evaluating therapeutic effects in childhood cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and the best means of evaluating those domains. DESIGN: Delphi iterative survey. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital with assessments conducted via mail or Internet. PARTICIPANTS: Youth with CP (n=21), parents of children with CP (n=23), and medical professionals (n=39). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of  the things you find most important to consider when you evaluate the effects of an intervention for yourself/your child/your patient with cerebral palsy  as domains of concern, followed by the best outcome measures to assess each of the domains, including preference rankings of those measures. RESULTS: Eight domains of importance were identified: impairment, general health, gross motor skills, self-care/fine motor skills, speech/communication, integration/participation, quality of life, and caregiver issues. All domains were viewed as important with no clear demarcation to allow reduction in number. Only quality of life emerged as being most important. Medical professionals suggested 10 to 27 different outcome measures for assessing each domain. Few of these measures, including the Gross Motor Function Measure and the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire, were broadly endorsed by the medical professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, youth, and medical professionals identify a wide range of arenas that they would like to see impacted by interventions for CP. These arenas can be consolidated into 8 domains. Although many outcome measures are available to evaluate these domains, few of the measures are widely preferred. Further work may determine optimal assessment strategies and provide guidance for therapeutic decisions.",M1
19963887,"Assessing the feasibility of classifying toe-walking severity in children with cerebral palsy using a sensorized shoe.The clinical management of children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) relies on monitoring changes in the severity of gait abnormalities and on planning appropriate clinical interventions. Currently available technology does not make it possible to perform clinical gait evaluations as often as it would be desirable from a clinical standpoint. The use of wearable technology (e.g. a sensorized shoe) could provide an effective means to monitor changes in the severity of gait abnormalities in children with CP. In this paper, we studied a group of children with CP who showed an equinus (i.e. toe-walking) gait pattern, a gait abnormality often observed in children with CP. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of relying upon a sensorized shoe to assess changes in the severity of toe-walking. We demonstrated that it is possible to use features extracted from the center of pressure trajectory and ankle kinematics to predict the severity of toe-walking. Our results motivate the development and clinical testing of a sensorized shoe to assess changes in gait patterns that accompany the development, and the response to clinical interventions, of children with CP.",M1
19963340,"Outpatient assessment of neurovisual functions in children with Cerebral Palsy.This study examined the feasibility of the Atkinson Battery for Child Development for Examining Functional Vision (Atkinson, Anker, Rae, et al., 2002) to evaluate neurovisual functions of children with neurodevelopmental disorders in outpatient setting. A total of 90 patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Among these, a group of 33 children with Cerebral Palsy (<e>CP</e>), mean age 6 years, with different types of CP (26% diplegic, 37% hemiplegic and 37% tetraplegic) were selected to constitute the cohort of the study. Visual sensory measures as well as higher level visual functions were considered. Overall, 73% patients had impairments at the assessment protocol, the majority of which presenting difficulties on both visuoperceptual and visuospatial tasks (79%). Subgroups of participants presented similar profiles of impairments with spared basic visuocognitive abilities and limitations in visuoperceptual and visuospatial domains. The Atkinson's battery proved to be valuable for evaluation in outpatient setting and follow-up testing. Some limitations emerged. For the definition of personalized and detailed rehabilitation programs a breakdown of the different components of vision and subsequent in-depth evaluation are needed.",M1
19961501,"Family needs of parents of children and youth with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Understanding the needs of families of children and youth with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) is important for family-centred services. The aims of this study were to identify: (1) differences in the number and types of family needs expressed by parents based on the age and gross motor function level of their children with CP; (2) the most frequent family needs; and (3) needs that differ on gross motor function level. METHODS: A total of 501 parents (77.6% mothers) of children and youth with CP completed a modified version of a Family Needs Survey and a demographic questionnaire. Children's gross motor function level was classified using the Gross Motor Function Classification System. RESULTS: Total number of family needs differed based on gross motor function level (P &lt; 0.001) but not age. Parents of children/youth who use wheeled mobility expressed the highest number of family needs, while parents of children/youth who walk without restrictions expressed the fewest needs. Family needs for Information (P= 0.001), Support (P= 0.001), Community Services (P &lt; 0.001) and Finances (P &lt; 0.001) differed based on children's gross motor function level. Over 50% of parents expressed family needs for information on current and future services, planning for the future, help in locating community activities and more personal time. Parents of children and youth who use wheeled mobility were more likely to express the need for help in paying for home modifications, equipment, services and locating sitters, respite care providers and community activities. CONCLUSIONS: The gross motor function of children/youth with CP has implications for collaboration with families to identify needs and co-ordinate services. Health professionals have a role to assist families with information needs and locating community services and leisure activities. Family needs for future planning suggest that health professionals should assist families to prepare for key periods in the lives of their children with CP.",M1
19961295,"Effects of dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses on children with cerebral palsy.This phase 1 exploratory study aimed to establish proof of concept of the effects of dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFOs) on the gait of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Replicated single case experiments employing an ABA methodology were carried out on eight subjects (median age 5.5 years, range 3-13 years; 4 girls/boys) utilizing quantitative/qualitative data collection. Outcome measures were: Ten metre walking test (10MWT); physiological cost index (PCI); visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring of perceived gait changes; functional mobility changes using Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS); subject/carer perceptions recorded in daily diaries. Results identified following analysis of quantitative data indicated a treatment effect from the orthoses which could be corroborated by participant subjective impressions and comments. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) intervention-related improvements in gait velocity and gait consistency were identified respectively in 5/8 and 4/8 subjects. Power calculations support the feasibility of a larger controlled study to further investigate this orthotic intervention. This study indicates that DEFO leggings can confer beneficial effects on the gait of some children with spastic diplegia resulting from <e>CP</e>. These findings have implications for orthotic intervention with this subject group.",M1
19939255,"Validity and reliability of the VOAA-DDD to assess spontaneous hand use with a video observation tool in children with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: In 2003 new computer software, the VOAA (Video Observations Aarts and Aarts), was designed to score and evaluate two important aspects of spontaneous upper limb use, i.e. overall duration and frequency of specific behaviours. The aim of this study was to investigate the test-retest, interrater and intrarater reliability and the construct validity of a new module, the VOAA-DDD, to determine developmental disregard in children with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: A test-retest design with three raters for reliability and a two-group design for construct validity were used. Subjects were a total of 20 children with spastic unilateral CP equally divided in two age groups (2.5-5 and 5-8 years), and 56 healthy children of the same age groups. Overall duration and frequency of specific behaviours of the affected arm and hand were assessed during a task demanding ('stringing beads') and a task stimulating ('decorating a muffin') the use of both hands. Reliability was estimated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Construct validity was assessed by comparing children with CP to healthy children. RESULTS: All ICCs exceeded 0.87. In contrast with healthy children, children with CP used their affected hand less during the 'muffin' task compared to the 'beads' task. Of the children with CP, 90% in the age group of 2.5-5 years and 50% in the age group of 5-8 years showed values exceeding the extreme values of healthy controls, respectively, indicating developmental disregard. CONCLUSION: The VOAA-DDD is a reliable and valid instrument to assess spontaneous use of the affected arm and hand in order to determine developmental disregard in children with spastic unilateral CP.",M1
19938160,"Interleukin-6 genotype and risk for cerebral palsy in term and near-term infants.OBJECTIVE: Chorioamnionitis is associated with increased risk for cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) in term infants. A functional polymorphism in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene has been implicated in newborn brain injury. We studied whether the IL-6 -174 G/C polymorphism confers increased risk for CP in term infants. METHODS: This population-based case-control study included 334,333 live-born infants born at &gt;or=36 weeks gestation within Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program from 1991 to 2002. Case patients (n = 250) were identified from electronic records and confirmed by chart review, and comprised all infants with spastic or dyskinetic CP not caused by developmental abnormalities who had a neonatal blood specimen available for study. Control patients (n = 305) were randomly selected from the study population. RESULTS: Compared with genotype GG, the less common CC genotype was associated with increased risk for overall CP (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.6), quadriparetic CP (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-9.3), and hemiparetic CP (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.7), after controlling for race. The C allele conferred increased risk for CP in both recessive and additive genetic models. In multivariate analysis controlling for race, independent risk factors for CP included CC genotype compared with GG (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4), clinical chorioamnionitis (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.1-10.4), maternal age &gt;or= 35 (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6-4.1), and male sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4).

19934797,"The correction of pelvic obliquity in patients with cerebral palsy and neuromuscular scoliosis: is there a benefit of anterior release prior to posterior spinal arthrodesis?STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 61 patients with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and neuromuscular scoliosis treated by either a combined anterior-posterior spinal arthrodesis or a posterior-only arthrodesis with the unit rod. OBJECTIVES: Compare coronal and sagittal plane radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing either a combined anterior-posterior spinal fusion (PSF) or a posterior-only fusion with the unit rod for neuromuscular scoliosis in patients with CP. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although an anterior release before posterior spinal arthrodesis is commonly done for larger and stiffer neuromuscular curves, it is unclear whether or not an all-posterior construct produces similar correction in pelvic obliquity as that seen with an anterior-posterior spinal fusion. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive children with CP and scoliosis were treated at a single institution between 1991 and 2003 with PSF using the unit rod with an anterior release (group A: 19 patients; average = 14.4 years) or without an anterior release (group B: 42 patients; average = 13.7 years). Side-bending, AP, and lateral radiographs were used to assess various sagittal and coronal plane parameters at baseline, after surgery, and at 2 years. RESULTS.: Before surgery, group A had larger major curves (91 degrees A vs. 72 degrees B; P = 0.001), less flexible major curves (21% A vs. 40% B; P = 0.01), with greater pelvic obliquity (26 degrees A vs. 19 degrees B, P = 0.02) than group B. In the subset of patients with a more severe preoperative pelvic obliquity (&gt;20 degrees ), percent correction in pelvic obliquity was equivalent between groups A (71%) and B (74%, P = 0.91). With respect to coronal and sagittal plane radiographic outcomes, there were no significant group differences in major curve correction (58% A vs. 60% B), but group A trended toward greater % correction from preop bending films. At most recent follow-up, there were no differences with respect to loss of curve correction (7.6 A vs. 8.1 degrees B, P = 0.80). The rate of major complications was 26% for both groups, but group A patients had significantly longer operative times. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that excellent correction in severe pelvic obliquity can be achieved in smaller, more flexible curves using an all-posterior PSF, and in larger, less flexible curves using an anterior release with PSF.",M1
19934707,"A prospective cohort study of the effects of lower extremity orthopaedic surgery on outcome measures in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Lower-extremity musculotendinous surgery is standard treatment for ambulatory children with deformities such as joint contractures and bony torsions resulting from cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). However, evidence of efficacy is limited to retrospective, uncontrolled studies with small sample sizes focusing on gait variables and clinical examination measures. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine whether lower-extremity musculotendinous surgery in ambulatory children with CP improves impairments and function measured by gait and clinical outcome tools beyond changes found in a concurrent matched control group. METHODS: Seventy-five children with spastic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I to III, age 4 to 18 y) that underwent surgery to improve gait were individually matched on the basis of sex, Gross Motor Function Classification System level, and CP subtype to a nonsurgical cohort, minimizing differences in age and Gross Motor Function Measure Dimension E. At baseline and at least 12 months after baseline or surgery, participants completed gait analysis and Gross Motor Function Measure, and parents completed outcome questionnaires. Mean changes at follow-up were compared using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline differences. RESULTS: Surgery ranged from single-level soft tissue release to multilevel bony and/or soft tissue procedures. At follow-up, after correcting for baseline differences, Gillette Gait Index, Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument Expectations, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Physical Functioning improved significantly for the surgical group compared with the nonsurgical group, which showed minimal change. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a matched concurrent data set, there was significant improvement in function after 1 year for a surgical group compared with a nonsurgical group as measured by the Gillette Gait Index, with few significant changes noted in outcome measures. Changes over 1 year are minimal in the nonsurgical group, supporting the possibility of ethically performing a randomized controlled trial using nonsurgical controls.

19934706,"Morphometric analysis of acetabular dysplasia in cerebral palsy: three-dimensional CT study.BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) eliminates the positioning errors and allows the clinician to more accurately assess the radiographic parameters present. To elucidate the 3D geometry of the acetabulum and the extent of hip subluxation/dislocation in patients with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), quantitative morphometric analysis was performed using 3D-CT data. METHODS: We evaluated 150 hips in 75 patients with bilateral spastic CP. The mean age of the patients was 5.4 years (range: 2.7 to 6.9 y). The fitting plane of the ilium was projected onto the coronal plane and then onto the sagittal plane, and then the angle formed with a horizontal line was defined as CTalpha (the lateral opening angle) and CTbeta (the sagittal inclination angle), respectively. The center of the acetabulum and the femoral head were defined, and the distance between these centers was divided by the femoral head diameter, defined as CT migration percentage (CTMP, %). RESULTS: In 123 (82%) of the 150 hips, the femoral head center was located posteriorly, superiorly, and laterally relative to the acetabular center. Large CTalpha cases tended to show large CTMP. CTalpha and CTMP were significantly larger in the cases with Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) level IV/V and spastic quadriplegia, than in the cases with GMFCS level II/III and spastic diplegia. CTbeta showed significant correlation with the acetabular defect on the lateral 3D reconstructed images. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional acetabular geometry and migration percentage in CP patients can be analyzed quantitatively using 3D-CT regardless of the abnormal spastic posture. The extent of acetabular dysplasia and subluxation is more severe in patients with GMFCS level IV/V and spastic quadriplesia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.",M1
19924492,"Long-term followup of total hip arthroplasty in patients with cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Patients with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) are at risk for hip arthrosis secondary to the loss of joint congruity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether THA relieved pain, improved function, and provided durable improvements. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 56 patients (59 hips) with CP who had THAs for painful hips. Chart review determined the preoperative, postoperative, and current functional levels. All patients or caregivers completed a questionnaire, including a modified Gross Motor Function Classification System mobility scale and qualitative reports of pain and satisfaction. Pain levels were measured on a visual analog scale at three times: preoperative, postoperative, and current. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 30.6 years. Minimum followup was 2 years (average, 9.7 years; range, 2-28 years). RESULTS: Pain relief was obtained in all patients. All patients returned to preoperative function (59) and 52 patients returned to prepain functional status (88%). Seven patients underwent acetabular component revisions, and two patients had a femoral stem component revision. The 2-year implant survival was 95%, and 10-year survivorship was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: THA can provide durable relief and improved function in patients with CP with severe coxarthrosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

19923972,"Repeatability of net mechanical efficiency during stair climbing in children with cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: To determine the smallest significant change in mechanical efficiency (MEnet) measured by a stair-climbing test. METHODS: Duplicate stair-climbing tests (T1 and T2), with more than a 30-minute rest between, were performed by 51 children with diplegic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) at levels II and III of Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and 9 children with typical development, aged 5.5 to 13.0 years. RESULTS: The T2 versus T1 slope values of MEnet for CP and typical development did not significantly differ from 1.00. MEnet was significantly higher for GMFCS level II (7.0%) than level III (1.2%). The mean percentage of difference was 7.8% (T2 &gt; T1) for the children with CP, with a 95% confidence interval of -39% to +54%. The 95% confidence interval for MEnet scores computed from the standard error of the mean (SEM) of the percentage of differences was 4.0 to 4.5 for CP. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of &gt;13.4% in MEnet score (eg, mean increase from 4.0% to 4.5%) can indicate improved motor status resulting from interventions.",M1
19923970,"Effects of intensive locomotor treadmill training on young children with cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: To examine whether an intensive, short-term locomotor treadmill training program helps children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) younger than 4 years of age improve their gross motor skills related to ambulation, walking speed, and endurance. METHODS: Six children with cerebral palsy, ages 2.5 to 3.9 years, participated in treadmill training 3 times per week for 1-hour sessions consisting of 2 individualized treadmill walks, for 4 weeks, and were tested before and after the intervention and at a 1-month follow-up. The outcome measures included the Gross Motor Function Measure-66, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, a timed 10-m walk test, and a 6-minute walk test. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 Dimensions D and E, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Mobility Scales, over-ground walking speed, and walking distance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that children with CP younger than 4 years of age can improve their gross motor function, walking speed, and walking endurance after intensive locomotor treadmill training.",M1
19917124,"The New Jersey Institute of Technology Robot-Assisted Virtual Rehabilitation (NJIT-RAVR) system for children with cerebral palsy: a feasibility study.BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that the integration of virtual reality (VR) with robot assisted rehabilitation could be successful if applied to children with hemiparetic <e>CP</e>. The combined benefits of increased attention provided by VR and the larger training stimulus afforded by adaptive robotics may increase the beneficial effects of these two approaches synergistically. This paper will describe the NJIT-RAVR system, which combines adaptive robotics with complex VR simulations for the rehabilitation of upper extremity impairments and function in children with CP and examine the feasibility of this system in the context of a two subject training study. METHODS: The NJIT-RAVR system consists of the Haptic Master, a 6 degrees of freedom, admittance controlled robot and a suite of rehabilitation simulations that provide adaptive algorithms for the Haptic Master, allowing the user to interact with rich virtual environments. Two children, a ten year old boy and a seven year old girl, both with spastic hemiplegia secondary to Cerebral Palsy were recruited from the outpatient center of a comprehensive pediatric rehabilitation facility. Subjects performed a battery of clinical testing and kinematic measurements of reaching collected by the NJIT-RAVR system. Subjects trained with the NJIT-RAVR System for one hour, 3 days a week for three weeks. The subjects played a combination of four or five simulations depending on their therapeutic goals, tolerances and preferences. Games were modified to increase difficulty in order to challenge the subjects as their performance improved. The testing battery was repeated following the training period. RESULTS: Both participants completed 9 hours of training in 3 weeks. No untoward events occurred and no adverse responses to treatment or complaints of cyber sickness were reported. One participant showed improvements in overall performance on the functional aspects of the testing battery. The second subject made improvements in upper extremity active range of motion and in kinematic measures of reaching movements. CONCLUSION: We feel that this study establishes the feasibility of integrating robotics and rich virtual environments to address functional limitations and decreased motor performance in children with mild to moderate cerebral palsy.",M1

A problem-orientated approach was used focussing on both published and practice-based evidence. In part I of the consensus the authors have tabulated the supporting evidence to produce a concise but comprehensive information base, pooling data and experience from 36 institutions in 9 European countries which involves more than 10,000 patients and over 45,000 treatment sessions during a period of more than 280 treatment years. In part II of the consensus the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) based Motor Development Curves have been expanded to provide a graphical framework on how to treat the motor disorders in children with CP. This graph is named  CP(Graph) Treatment Modalities - Gross Motor Function  and is intended to facilitate communication between parents, therapists and medical doctors concerning (1) achievable motor function, (2) realistic goal-setting and (3) treatment perspectives for children with CP. The updated European consensus 2009 summarises the current understanding regarding an integrated, multidisciplinary treatment approach using Botulinum toxin for the treatment of children with CP.",M1
19901618,"The use of standing frames for contracture management for nonmobile children with cerebral palsy.The objective of this study was to determine whether static weight-bearing in a standing frame affected hamstring length and ease of activities of daily living (ADLs) in nonambulant children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). A convenient sample of nonambulant children with CP was recruited for this one-group quasi-experimental study. Participants stood in a standing frame for 1 h, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of not using a standing frame; each phase was repeated. Popliteal angle measurements were made at baseline and weekly throughout the study period. Carers provided written feedback regarding ease of ADLs at the end of each standing and nonstanding phase. Five children were recruited (age range 6-9 years, mean age 7 years 2 months, SD 1 year 4 months). High compliance with the standing regime was achieved (85% of intended sessions completed). Repeated-measures analysis of variance and t-tests showed hamstrings significantly lengthened during standing phases (mean improvement 18.1 degrees , SD 5.5, P&lt;0.01 for first standing phase; mean improvement 12.1 degrees , SD 7.7, P=0.03 for second standing phase). A trend for hamstrings to shorten during nonstanding phases was observed (mean change -14.0 degrees , SD 4.2, P=0.02 for first nonstanding phase; mean change -7.3 degrees , SD 6.5, P=0.20 for second nonstanding phase). Feedback from carers suggested that transfers and ADLs became slightly easier after phases of standing frame use. Preliminary evidence that 6 weeks of standing frame use leads to significant improvements in hamstring length in nonambulant children with CP, and may increase ease of performance of ADLs was found.",M1
19887214,"Experienced problems of young adults with cerebral palsy: targets for rehabilitation care.OBJECTIVE: To determine the problems experienced by young adults with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and the relationship between those problems and personal and CP-related characteristics. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Rehabilitation centers in the southwest Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Young adults (N=87; aged 18-22y) with CP and normal intelligence (roughly corresponding to an intelligence quotient &gt;70, excluding participants who attended schools for those with learning disabilities). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure in a semistructured interview to assess participants for experienced problems. We further categorized experienced problems according to the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and assessed the relationship between those problems and personal and CP-related characteristics (eg, age, sex, level of gross motor functioning, manual ability, level of education) using appropriate correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of participants experienced problems in daily life, addressing the areas of self-care (59%), productivity (52%), and leisure activities (37%). More specifically, problems were most prevalent in recreation and leisure (30%), preparing meals (29%), housework (14%), and dressing (14%). Problems in functional mobility, paid or unpaid work, and socialization were considered as most important (represented by the highest mean importance score). Mobility problems were associated with lower levels of gross motor functioning (Spearman rho=.39), and problems with self-care were associated with lower levels of manual ability (Spearman rho=.40). CONCLUSIONS: Although frequently addressed during pediatric rehabilitation care, problems with mobility and self-care still prevail in young adults with CP. In addition, during the transition into adulthood, young adults with CP may experience problems regarding domestic life and work, which they consider important.",M1
19880137,"Neurobehavioral assessment predicts motor outcome in preterm infants.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavior Scales (NNNS) at 44 weeks predict motor outcome at 2 years in preterm infants from the Maternal Lifestyles Study (MLS). STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected on all preterm infants (&lt;36 weeks) in the MLS who underwent an NNNS at 44 weeks (n = 395) and neurologic examination at 12 to 36 months or Bayley Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) at 24 months (n = 270). Logistic regression analyzed NNNS summary scores associated with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) or PDI &lt;70, while controlling for birth weight &lt;/=1250 g. RESULTS: Eighteen of 395 infants (5%) had CP; 24 of 270 infants (9%) had PDI &lt;70. CP was associated with low quality of movement (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.24-3.06; P = .004) and high lethargy (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.01-2.76; P = .045). The model contributed 19% of the variance in CP diagnosis at 12 to 36 months (R(2) = .19, P &lt; .001). Low PDI was associated with low handling (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-2.99; P = .017), low quality of movement (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.38-3.38; P = .001), and hypotonia (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.14-2.32; P = .007). The model contributed 26% of the variance in PDI &lt;70 at 24 months (R(2) = 0.26, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: The neurobehavioral profile of under-arousal in 44-week-old preterm infants may predict poor motor outcome.",M1
19875467,"Anatomic localization of dyskinesia in children with  profound  perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <e>CP</e> is a common feature of perinatal HIBD in the context of  acute profound  injury, and in this article, we have studied the possible anatomic substrates of dyskinesia. We have reviewed the extent of brain injury in children with dyskinetic and spastic CP due to acute profound hypoxia to identify sites of injury that explain why only some children develop movement disorders. It is known that the STN has a role in the development of movement disorders; therefore, we have specifically studied it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR imaging of 40 consecutive children referred to our center with CP confirmed to be due to acute profound hypoxic-ischemic injury. All children received the same high-resolution MR imaging protocol with the same 1.5T scanner. Two pediatric neuroradiologists reviewed the imaging. Logistic regression was applied to identify multivariable predictors that differentiate dyskinetic and spastic CP. RESULTS: Twenty children had dyskinetic CP and 20 had spastic CP. Children with dyskinetic CP had more frequent injury to the STN, as manifest by increased T2 signal intensity. Children with spastic CP had more severe damage to white matter in the vicinity of the paracentral lobule. Injuries to the putamen, caudate, and globus pallidus were not significant predictors of dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown an association between hypoxic-ischemic injury to the STN at birth and the emergence of dyskinesia later in life.",M1
19874075,"A systematic review of the effectiveness of treadmill training for children with cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: The development of efficient and independent walking is an important therapeutic goal for many children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). Consequently, there has been growing interest in determining the effects of treadmill training programs for these children. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of treadmill training for children with CP. Relevant trials were identified by searching electronic databases and by citation tracking. RESULTS: Of 125 papers initially identified, five met the criteria for review. Results showed that treadmill training is safe and feasible for children with CP across a wide range of ages and functional abilities. Children with more severely affected walking ability significantly increased their walking speed (d = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.49-2.40) and gross motor performance (d = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.50-2.50) after training. However, the results also suggested that treadmill speed and length of training sessions might need to be set to specifically match desired intervention goals such as increasing walking speed or endurance. CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that treadmill training is safe and feasible for children with CP and indicates that there may be some positive benefits in walking speed over short distances and in general gross motor skills. The provision of PBWS may be particularly beneficial for children with more severe walking disability (GMFCS III and IV). Further research is necessary before it can be concluded that treadmill training is beneficial for children with CP.",M1
19864110,"Effects of frequency of feedback on the learning of motor skill in individuals with cerebral palsy.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frequency of knowledge of results (KR) on the learning of dart in individuals with cerebral palsy type I. Twenty-four individuals with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) between the ages of 5 and 17 were chosen for this study. They were put into 3 homogenous groups according to their records after 20 throws and practiced for 8 sessions. The first group (0% KR) received no KR for any trials, the second group (50% KR) received KR for half of their trials (50%), and the third group (100% KR) received KR for all their trials (100%). The acquisition test was run immediately after the last session and the retention test was run 3 days later. Paired sample t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data from the acquisition and retention tests. According to the results of this study, those with cerebral palsy have the ability of acquiring and retaining a new motor skill under the condition of feedback provision. Interestingly it was found that too much feedback interferes with learning of tasks in individuals with CP as in the average population. This finding shows that rules regarding feedback also apply to people afflicted with CP.",M1
19863779,"Development of lower limb range of motion from early childhood to adolescence in cerebral palsy: a population-based study.BACKGROUND: The decreasing range of joint motion caused by insufficient muscle length is a common problem in children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>), often worsening with age. In 1994 a CP register and health care programme for children with CP was initiated in southern Sweden. The aim of this study was to analyse the development of the passive range of motion (ROM) in the lower limbs during all the growth periods in relation to gross motor function and CP subtype in the total population of children with CP. METHODS: In total, 359 children with CP born during 1990-1999, living in the southernmost part of Sweden in the year during which they reached their third birthday and still living in the area in the year of their seventh birthday were analysed. The programme includes a continuous standardized follow-up with goniometric measurements of ROM in the lower limbs. The assessments are made by each child's local physiotherapist twice a year until 6 years of age, then once a year. In total, 5075 assessments from the CPUP database from 1994 to 1 January 2007 were analysed. RESULTS: The study showed a decreasing mean range of motion over the period 2-14 years of age in all joints or muscles measured. The development of ROM varied according to GMFCS level and CP subtype. CONCLUSION: We found a decreasing ROM in children with CP from 2-14 years of age. This information is important for both the treatment and follow-up planning of the individual child as well as for the planning of health care programmes for all children with CP.",M1
19854058,"Age and electromyographic frequency alterations during walking in children with cerebral palsy.The use of surface electromyography (sEMG) recorded during ambulation has provided valuable insight into motor development and changes with age in the pediatric population. However, no studies have reported sEMG differences with age in the children with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>). In this study, data from 50 children were divided retrospectively into four groups, representing either an older (above the age of seven years) or younger (below the age of seven years) age group with either typical development (TD) or CP. Data were analyzed from 16 children in the younger age group with TD, and eight in the older age group with TD. Data were also available from 14 in the younger age group with CP, and 12 in the older age group with CP. SEMG signals from the rectus femoris (RF) and medial hamstring (MH) were analyzed using wavelet techniques to examine time-frequency content. RF muscle activity was statistically different between all groups (p&lt;0.001), with an elevated instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) in the older TD group than the younger TD group, an elevated IMNF in the younger CP group than the older CP group, and elevated IMNF in both CP groups compared to both TD groups. Activity for the MH muscle followed the same pattern except for the CP young and old group comparison, which indicated no difference. The results indicate that differences in neuromuscular activation exist between younger and older groups of children with both TD and CP, and may provide new insight into muscle activity pattern changes during the development of walking.",M1
19852713,"Goal-directed functional therapy: a longitudinal study on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy.PURPOSE: To investigate gross motor function and goal attainment in children with cerebral palsy before, during and after goal-directed functional therapy (GDT), to evaluate body functions, and explore relationships. METHOD: Prospective longitudinal intervention study. Twenty-two children, uni- or bilateral <e>CP</e>, 1-6 years (mean: 46 months SD: 16 months), classified in GMFCS and MACS level I-IV participated. Outcome measures were Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66), performed at seven occasions, Goal Attainment Scale, assessments of passive range of motion, spasticity and selective motor control (SMC). Baseline, the GDT-intervention and the follow-up period were 12 weeks each. RESULTS: Improvements were demonstrated in GMFM-66 during the intervention (mean difference: 5.07, CI: 3.8-6.4, p &lt; 0.001). The baseline and follow-up assessments were stable. Evaluations of ankle dorsiflexion displayed small improvement (mean difference: 9 degrees , CI: 5-13, p &lt; 0.001). Estimations of spasticity and SMC did not demonstrate significant changes. Goal attainment to the expected level or higher was achieved in 93/110 goals and further improved at the long-term follow-up (103/110). CONCLUSION: Gross motor function improved during GDT, and was maintained 12 weeks later. The goals were reached to a high extent, and the children gradually progressed towards their goals after the end of the intervention. The therapy did not induce any deterioration of body functions.",M1
19851759,"Influence of accuracy constraints on bimanual coordination during a goal-directed task in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.Previously we found that children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) have impaired bimanual coordination compared to typically developing children during a functional drawer-opening task. However, performance of the task under time constraints (fast-as-possible) facilitated better bimanual coordination for these children. Accuracy is another important task constraint that could influence the coordination of the two hands during such tasks. The effect of accuracy constraints on bimanual coordination in children with hemiplegic CP is not well understood. In the present study, children were asked to reach forward and open a drawer with one hand and then activate a light switch inside the drawer with the contralateral hand. Task accuracy constraints (different handles and switch sizes) were manipulated in order to determine their effect on upper extremity coordination. Eleven children with hemiplegic CP (age 8-16 years) and eleven age-matched typically developing children participated in this study. The results show that higher accuracy constraints prolong the total movement completion time for both groups of children. However, children with hemiplegic CP demonstrated less sequential movement with a higher accuracy constraint (a smaller knob handle) than a lower accuracy constraint (a larger loop handle). Nevertheless, presentation of both higher accuracy constraints (handle and switch) at the same time was detrimental to their performance. These influences of task constraints were similar regardless of which hand was used to open the drawer. The results suggest that performance may not be linearly related to the constraints, and in some cases  more is not better .",M1
19851607,"[Oral health conditions diagnostic in cerebral palsy individuals of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil]Cerebral Palsy (<e>CP</e>) is an encephalic static lesion defined as a non-progressive disorder of movements and posture. It is usually associated with epilepsy, speaking, hearing and sight disorders and also mental retardation. Even though, people who have CP need special care for the prevention of factors linked to oral problems, in the odontological context, the literary information is contradictory when it comes to the incidence of oral diseases on patients who have cerebral palsy. In order to determine the oral health and associated factors conditions, an epidemiological research has been made in 41 children who have cerebral palsy. The variables taken into account were: social-economical aspects, risk factors for the development of oral diseases, access to odontological care, caries index, periodontal disease, malocclusion and dental fluorose. Children who were examined showed a higher level of gingivitis and caries experience, mainly on the primary dentition, and also severe malocclusions, factors that indicate the need of early intervention, whether with educational programs or healing assistance. The study has shown that, in addition to the quantitative necessity of care, it is also necessary to improve the quality of these patients' consultations.",M1
19846389,"Changes in neurodevelopmental outcome at age eight in geographic cohorts of children born at 22-27 weeks' gestational age during the 1990s.BACKGROUND: The survival rate for children born with gestational ages 22-27 weeks is increasing, and this may be associated with higher rates of disability. The aims of this study were to determine the outcomes at age eight for a regional cohort of children born at 22-27 weeks during 1997, and to compare their rates of disability with a cohort of the same gestational age born in 1991-1992. METHODS: Consecutive children with gestational ages in the range 22-27 weeks born in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 1997 and matched term controls were assessed at 8 years. Outcomes included blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) and intellectual impairment and disabilities caused by these impairments. These outcomes were compared with a cohort of 22-27-week and term children born in 1991-1992 in the same region. RESULTS: Follow-up rates for the 1997 cohort at 8 years of age were 95% (144/151) for 22-27 weeks survivors and 89% (173/195) for controls. Rates of disability were substantially higher in the preterm cohort than the controls. The 1997 and 1991-1992 preterm cohorts had similar rates of moderate or severe disability (19%), however the rate of mild impairment was greater in 1997 (40% vs 24%). Rates of disability were almost identical in control groups. Intellectual impairment and CP were the major reasons for the higher rates of disability. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in children born at 22-27 weeks compared with term controls at school age persists, and may even be increasing over time.",M1
19840287,"Children with cerebral palsy: severity and trends over time.Increasingly, more very-low-birthweight infants in the developed world are now expected to survive the neonatal period than was previously the case. There are concerns that there may be a related increase in the number of infants developing severe sensorimotor impairments. Pooled data from five registers contributing to the UK Network of Cerebral Palsy Registers, Surveys and Databases were used to identify patterns of motor impairment in relation to additional impairments and to birthweight, and to assess whether prevalence of cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) by birthweight and by severity of motor impairment had changed over time. Low-birthweight infants are at greater risk of developing CP than larger-birthweight babies. The CP rate amongst children with birthweights &lt;2500 g was significantly higher at 16 per 1000 livebirths [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.9, 16.2] than 1.2 per 1000 livebirths [95% CI 11, 1.2] for normal-birthweight children. Despite being at greater risk of developing CP, smaller-birthweight babies are proportionately less likely to develop the most severe forms of motor impairment. Of those born weighing &gt; or = 2500 g, 23% compared with 15% weighing &lt;1000 g (P &lt; 0.001) were in the most severely motor impaired group. Severe motor impairment is associated with higher levels of additional impairments. CP rates for each motor impairment group in the 1990s were similar to those in the late 1970s. Rates of CP among infants born below normal birthweight are high but have decreased over time. The CP rate for infants weighing 1000-1499 g at birth decreased from around 180 per 1000 livebirths in 1979 to around 50 per 1000 livebirths from the early 1990s onwards.",M1
19815646,"Social and community participation of children and youth with cerebral palsy is associated with age and gross motor function classification.BACKGROUND: Through social and community participation, children and youth with cerebral palsy (<e>CP</e>) form friendships, gain knowledge, learn skills, express creativity, and determine meaning and purpose in life. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine whether social and community participation of children and youth with CP differ based on age, sex, and gross motor function, and (2) to identify the types of activities in which social and community participation are highest. DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional analytic design was used. The participants were a sample of convenience of 291 children (6-12 years of age) and 209 youth (13-21 years of age) with CP (55.4% males, 44.6% females) receiving services from 7 children's hospitals. Participants completed the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) by structured interview. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level was determined by the researchers. RESULTS: Youth did a higher percentage of activities with friends and others and outside the home than children. Children and youth in level I did a higher percentage of activities with friends and others compared with children and youth in levels II and III and in levels IV and V. Children and youth in level I and in levels IV and V did a higher percentage of activities outside the home than children and youth in levels II and III. Differences were not found between females and males. The percentage of activities done with friends and others and outside the home was highest for physical and skill-based activities. LIMITATIONS: Findings cannot be attributed only to GMFCS level. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to walk without restrictions is desirable for social and community participation. For children and youth with CP who have limitations in mobility, physical therapists have roles as consultants for accessibility, activity accommodations, and assistive technology and as advocates for inclusive environments.",M1
17673148,"Non-cell Corynebacterium parvum generated by nanotechnology: a promising immunomodulator with less side effects.Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), a kind of immunomodulator, has been well documented in immunotherapy to tumor. However, severe side effects, such as intrahepatic granulomas and scleromas in injected areas, restrict its clinical application. To minimize side effects of CP, a non-cell Corynebacterium parvum product (NCPP) was prepared by disposing CP with Nanotechnology. In present study, we compared effect of NCPP with that of CP and found: (1) NCPP with non-formaldehyde residue was easy to be absorbed without swelling and scleroma in local injected areas; (2) NCPP caused no obvious liver injury in murine and macaques; (3) NCPP maintained powerful anti-tumor activity, increased splenic index, elevated macrophage number, phagocytosis and production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and nitric oxide (NO); (4) Importantly, unparallel CP, NCPP could stimulate macrophages to produce low level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) but high level of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), an inhibitor to fibrosis. Our study has led to the view that NCPP will evolve into a new valuable immunomodulator for clinical application.",M2
16595952,"Protective effects of a neutral polysaccharide isolated from the mycelium of Antrodia cinnamomea on Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide induced hepatic injury in mice.Mycelia of Antrodia cinnamomea were extracted with chloroform and hot water. A neutral polysaccharide named ACN2a separated from the water extract was purified using 10% CCl3COOH, and repeated column chromatography on HW-65 and DE-52 cellulose. Its structure was determined by chemical and spectroscopic analyses. ACN2a was composed of Gal, Glc, Fuc, Man and GalN (in the ratio 1:0.24:0.07:0.026:faint), in which an alpha-D-(1--&gt;6)-Gal linkage accounted for 73% of all linkages. The ratio of branch points was about 16% of the total residual numbers, and branches were attached to C-2 of galactosyl residues of the main chain. ACN2a had an average molecular weight of 12.9x10(5) Daltons, [alpha]D25=+115 degrees (c=0.44, H2O); [eta]=0.0417dl.g-1, <e>Cp</e>=0.2663 cal/(g. degrees C). The hepatoprotective effect of ACN2a was evaluated using a mouse model of hepatic injury that was induced by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

16243995,"Nitric oxide is not a mediator of inflammation-induced resistance to atracurium.Resistance to atracurium as a result of increased drug binding to alpha1-acid glycoprotein is associated with increased inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and increased nitric oxide levels in plasma. We investigated if the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppression of nitric oxide can reverse the resistance to atracurium. As a model of alpha1-acid glycoprotein and nitric oxide increase, 84 male Sprague-Dawley rats received an IV injection of either 60 mg/kg Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) or saline (control). The 2 groups (CP/Control) were further divided into subgroups, receiving the selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-Iminolysine, via drinking water at different concentrations. On day 4 post-CP injection, the pharmacodynamics of atracurium were determined. Plasma concentrations of nitric oxide, atracurium, and alpha1-acid glycoprotein were measured and acetylcholine receptor numbers were quantified. In the CP groups, N-Iminolysine suppressed nitric oxide levels in a dose-dependent manner. Resistance to atracurium persisted. alpha1-acid glycoprotein serum levels remained increased in all CP groups with no differences in acetylcholine receptor expression. Our results suggest that the mechanism leading to increased expression of alpha1-acid glycoprotein and consecutive increased protein binding of atracurium is not mediated by inducible nitric oxide synthase induction and nitric oxide expression.",M2

Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent mastectomy and axillary dissection under general anaesthesia. Following surgery, the rats were treated in 1 of 3 ways. In the prevention group, 1 cm3 (0.35 mg) CP solution was injected beneath the skin flap just before closure of the incision after mastectomy. In the treatment group, animals in which a seroma was formed, the fluid was aspirated, and 1 cm3 CP solution was injected beneath the flap. In the control group, animals in which seromas formed, aspiration only was performed. The frequency of seroma formation decreased when CP solution was injected immediately after the operation (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, seroma formation was effectively treated by CP injection when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). CP was effective as a prophylactic agent in the prevention group and as a therapeutic agent in the treatment group in this experimental model. CP injection may be useful for the management of this problem in a clinical setting.",M2
11309066,"Activation of clindamycin phosphate by human skin.AIMS: To investigate the relative antimicrobial activity of clindamycin phosphate (<e>CP</e>) and clindamycin (Cly) and to examine the effect of skin homogenates on the activity of CP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against dermally relevant organisms and bactericidal activity was studied using time-kill methodology. The effect of skin homogenates on the antimicrobial activity of CP was studied by well-diffusion assay. The MIC of Cly was substantially lower than that of CP in all susceptible organisms. Clindamycin also showed greater bactericidal activity (rate of kill) than CP. Phosphatases in skin homogenates activated CP at pH 4-8 with a maximal activation at pH 4. CONCLUSION: Phosphatases within the skin have been shown to convert CP to the more potent form Cly. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Conversion to Cly is a major determinant of antimicrobial activity in the skin layers following topical application of CP.",M2
11124644,"Comparison of the effectiveness of some pleural sclerosing agents used for control of effusions in malignant pleural mesothelioma: a review of 117 cases.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Management of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has been an important clinical issue regardless of the treatment modality employed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of oxytetracycline (OT), Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), and nitrogen mustard (NM) in the management of pleural effusion associated with MPM. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients who had stage-2 MPM or over according to the Butchart staging system and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion took part in the study. The patients received either OT (35 mg/kg), CP (7 mg), or NM (0.4 mg/kg) through a chest tube for pleurodesis. The association between several clinical parameters and patient survival was also investigated. RESULTS: OT was applied to 59, CP to 29 and NM to 29 cases. A statistical analysis of the results obtained by these agents have demonstrated that OT (30 days, 81%; 90 days, 76.2%) and CP (30 days, 86.2%; 90 days, 79.3%) led to a significantly higher rate of successful pleurodesis as compared to NM (30 days, 48.2%; 90 days, 41.3%; p &lt;0.05). Although the procedure was generally well tolerated by the patients, the NM-treated group experienced significantly more nausea-vomiting (46.1%) and hypotension (35.8%) compared to patients who received OT (nausea-vomiting and hypotension 4.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and CP (nausea-vomiting and hypotension 5.1%; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we found that thrombocytosis, chest pain and weight loss were significantly associated with poor prognosis, whereas epithelial type had a positive effect on survival. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OT and CP may be used as effective sclerosing agents for pleurodesis in the control of pleural effusions associated with MPM, without major side effects.",M2
9432522,"Porphyrin sensitization and intracellular calcium changes in the prokaryote Propionibacterium acnes.Photosensitization induces intracellular free calcium changes ([Ca2+]i) in some eukaryotic cell systems which either contribute to or protect against cell inactivation. We have investigated whether or not similar changes can be induced in prokaryotes. The skin bacterium Propionibacterium acnes was sensitized using protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Exogenous ALA resulted in either a preferential accumulation of protoporphyrin (ALA-PP) or of coproporphyrin and/or uroporphyrin (ALA-<e>CP</e>/UP) in P. acnes. For PP IX or ALA-PP sensitization, exposure to broad-band red light resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i. For ALA-PP sensitization, this increase was transient and [Ca2+]i returned to basal levels within 5-10 min after irradiation. However, the elevated [Ca2+]i levels obtained after PP IX sensitization were maintained for at least 1 h after irradiation. In both cases, the reduction in the external calcium concentration led to an enhancement in the cell survival, indicating that induced [Ca2+]i changes may participate in photoinactivation. Sensitization by hydrophilic coproporphyrin and/or uroporphyrin (ALA-CP/UP) did not affect the [Ca2+]i levels, but higher levels of cell inactivation were obtained. It therefore appears that damage to membrane-associated components is at least partly responsible for [Ca2+]i alterations after photosensitization.",M2
8630544,"Heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum enhances endotoxin lung injury with increased TNF production in guinea pigs.Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) is known to increase susceptibility to endotoxin, which is associated with increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We investigated the effect of CP-priming on the pathogenesis of acute lung injury caused by intratracheal Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). Guinea pigs were divided into four groups: (1) control (n=6), (2) CP-alone (n=6), (3) LPS-alone (n=6) and (4) CP + LPS (n=6). A CP dose of 4 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally 7 d before the study. Animals were observed for 4 h after intratracheal administration of 0.02 mg/kg of LPS. The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D), [125I] albumin concentration ratio of lung tissue to plasma (T/P) and of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid to plasma (B/P) and differential cell count in BAL fluid were examined. In the LPS-alone group, neither excess lung water nor increased albumin leakage was observed. The CP + LPS group showed increased lung water and albumin leakage as compared with the other three groups (p&lt;0.05). We also observed increased cell counts in BAL fluid (p&lt;0.05), in the CP + LPS group. The spleen weight was increased in guinea pigs pretreated with CP, indicating reticuloendothelial system (RES) activation. In the CP + LPS group, the TNF level was increased in both plasma and BAL fluid. We conclude that pretreatment with CP enhances LPS-induced acute lung injury in parallel with increasing TNF production, which suggests that the activation of mononuclear phagocytes contributes to increased susceptibility to intratracheal endotoxin in guinea pigs.",M2
7604530,"Effective immune protection of pigs against cysticercosis.A scolex protein antigen (SPA) was prepared from cysticerci of Taenia solium obtained from naturally infected pigs. Yorkshire pigs were vaccinated with SPA plus incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) or with SPA plus Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). Controls were given IFA plus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or CP plus PBS. All animals were given three subcutaneous injections at 20-day intervals. Ten days after the third injection, the pigs were fed with 10(4) viable eggs of T. solium. All pigs developed a delayed type hypersensitivity, and a transient eosinophilia after the first dose of vaccine. High titers of specific antibodies were detected in the sera of vaccinated animals and in infected controls. A protection level of 71.43% was recorded in animals vaccinated with SPA plus IFA and of 75.00% in those vaccinated with SPA plus CP.",M2
7974494,"Kupffer cell stimulation with Corynebacterium parvum reduces some cytochrome P450-dependent activities and diminishes acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in the rat.Chemical activation of Kupffer cells in vivo by vitamin A or latex beads is associated with a worsening of hepatic injury induced by the P450-dependent hepatotoxins acetaminophen (ACET) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and by the P450-independent toxin galactosamine (GLN). Immunostimulants such as Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) also activate Kupffer cells, but do so while prompting release of soluble mediators which depress microsomal oxidative activities in cultured hepatocytes. Therefore, we sought to characterize the effects of CP on hepatic injury in vivo due to ACET and CCl4 while employing GLN as a control. Hepatic microsomal oxidative activity and glutathione (GSH) disposition were examined since each influences susceptibility to injury from ACET or CCl4. Rats were given CP 28 mg/kg i.v. 5 days before challenge with hepatotoxicant. Hepatic injury was assessed 24 hr after hepatotoxicant administration by measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and review of histological sections. Livers from parallel groups of rats were used to prepare microsomal and cytosolic fractions, to measure tissue GSH, or for perfusion to assess GSH efflux. Significant reductions in injury due to ACET or CCl4 were observed while injury due to GLN was potentiated. Serum ALT levels after ACET were 3000 +/- 620 in controls vs 170 +/- 45 IU/liter in the CP-treated group and ALT levels after CCl4 were 3100 +/- 500 in controls vs 1700 + 450 IU/liter in the CP-treated group. In contrast, serum ALT levels after GLN were 920 +/- 230 in controls vs 1700 +/- 370 in the CP-treated group. Patterns of hepatic injury observed on histological sections were those characteristic for each toxin and the severity of injury correlated well with alterations in serum ALT levels for each agent. Hepatic microsomal fractions from rats pretreated with CP showed significantly diminished total cytochrome P450 content as well as reduced activity for two P450IIE1 substrates, p-nitrophenol and 7-ethoxycoumarin. While sinusoidal efflux of GSH increased by 40% in rats pretreated with CP and cytosolic glutathione-S-transferase activity fell slightly, tissue GSH levels were unaffected. These data demonstrate that CP decreases microsomal cytochrome P450 content, reduces biotransformation of two P450IIE1 substrates, and diminishes ACET- and CCl4-induced hepatic injury. In contrast, hepatic injury due to the P450-independent toxin GLN was enhanced. Thus, chemical and immune stimulation of Kupffer cells may result in divergent effects on susceptibility to injury from individual hepatotoxins.",M2
7830526,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 replication and IL-1 beta gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages activated in vivo by an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium vaccine or Corynebacterium parvum.Activated macrophages (M phi) from mice given Salmonella typhimurium or Corynebacterium parvum were compared with resident peritoneal macrophages at the molecular level for permissiveness for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication and for expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from mice injected 7 days previously with live, avirulent S. typhimurium (Sal-PM phi) or heat-killed C. parvum (<e>CP</e>-PM phi) and infected with HSV-1 in vitro. Both Sal-PM phi and CP-PM phi were activated as evidenced by characteristic changes in an ectoenzyme, by increased permissiveness for infectious virus production and viral cytopathic effect, and by induction of IL-1 beta mRNA. Analysis at the molecular level revealed that both types of activated M phi demonstrated increased patterns of HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression and viral DNA replication as compared with resident cells. A novel finding was that viral infection reduced IL-1 beta mRNA in both types of activated M beta. This observation has implications for the efficacy of Salmonella vaccines given in proximity to HSV-1 infection and for potential deleterious effects of HSV-1 infection in immunosuppressed patients receiving immunotherapy.",M2
8206513,"Induced hyporesponsiveness in rat Kupffer cells is not specific for lipopolysaccharide.The phenomenon of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyporesponsiveness has been reported to occur in macrophage cell lines and primary cells. Hyporesponsiveness was evidenced by a diminution or lack of production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after sequential doses of LPS. In order to characterize the hyporesponsive state in Kupffer cells, the production of TNF-alpha was quantified after varying the concentration of a primary low dose of LPS prior to a challenge with a high, normally stimulatory dose of LPS. The kinetics of establishment of the hyporesponsive state and the effect of varying the bacterial serotype and genus of the challenge dose were determined. The specificity of the hyporesponsive state for LPS was examined. Our results demonstrate that complete hyporesponsiveness with no detectable production of TNF-alpha (&lt; 30 pg/ml) was achieved after a primary dose &gt; or = 10 ng/ml. Establishment of the hyporesponsive state took place within 6 hr. Induction of hyporesponsiveness was not dependent upon the serotype or genus of the challenge dose of LPS and was not specific for LPS. Complete hyporesponsiveness was induced after a primary dose (10 micrograms/ml) of the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) and was evident upon challenge with 100 micrograms/ml Cp. The data indicate that the mechanisms by which LPS and Cp induce hyporesponsiveness are not identical in that a primary dose of LPS (10 ng/ml) induced only partial hyporesponsiveness upon challenge with Cp (100 micrograms/ml). These studies improve our understanding of Kupffer cell function.",M2
1623214,"Effects of intravesical Corynebacterium parvum on recurrences of superficial tumors of the urinary bladder.We studied 96 patients with superficial tumors of the urinary bladder treated by transurethral resection in order to investigate the value of intravesical Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) to prevent recurrences. In 52 cases, two vials (2 ml, 4 mg CP) diluted in 60 ml buffer saline were intravesically administered weekly 12 times and then monthly for a period of 2 years. All patients were studied in a 3 year follow-up by cytology, histology and endoscopy. Recurrences were observed in 21.1% of cases in the CP treated group and in 54.5% of cases in the untreated group. CP immunostimulation is less effective in preventing recurrences in patients with malignant cells as indicated by urine smears in the post-operative period. Morphological changes of the bladder wall due to CP administration in patients without recurrences are described. Chronic lymphocyte infiltrate appears to be an essential event for the action of CP as an adjuvant therapy in urinary bladder cancer.",M2
1582732,"Influence of Corynebacterium parvum-PER on disease progression in the NZB/W model of systemic lupus erythematosus.Murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit some, but not all, of the characteristics of human disease. Disease progression in the animal models is regulated by autoantibodies, genetics and inflammatory processes. In the present study, the influence of the pyridine extract residue of Corynebacterium parvum Type I (<e>CP</e>-PER) on disease progression in the NZB/W model of SLE was investigated. CP-PER is known to activate the reticuloendothelial (RE) system of mice and can alter a number of host responses. Injection of NZB/W females with CP-PER at 10 weeks of age, prior to the onset of overt disease, led to a transient activation of the RE system which then appeared to return to levels observed in untreated animals. Sera from treated and untreated animals were analyzed for anti-nuclear antibodies, and anti-ssDNA antibodies. The most prominant change in the treated animals was an increase in the titer of anti-ssDNA. On average, animals in the early treatment group also lived somewhat longer than those in the untreated control group. Treatment of animals with CP-PER at 6 months of age, when the disease was evident, again led to transient RES activation and an altered autoantibody profile. Animals treated with CP-PER at 6 months of age exhibited a slightly accelerated death rate when compared with the untreated controls. These results indicate that bacterial response modifiers such as C. parvum-PER, which contains primarily the RES activating activity of C. parvum, can alter disease progression in the NZB/W model.",M2
1937965,"Modulation of tumoricidal activity, induced in bone-marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes by interferon gamma or Corynebacterium parvum, by interferon beta, tumor necrosis factor, prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor beta.Among a series of agents, including various interleukins and growth factors, only interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) organisms were able to elicit, within 24 hr, tumoricidal activity in bone-marrow-derived mononuclear (BMM) phagocytes. In subsequent experiments, the abilities of interferon beta (IFN beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and transforming growth factor beta (TFG beta), alone or in combinations of 2, to modulate tumoricidal activity triggered in BMM phagocytes by IFN gamma or CP, were compared. In concentrations secreted by macrophages under physiological conditions, these agents proved potent in modulating induction and/or expression of tumoricidal activity. However, their ability to interfere with tumoricidal activity varied considerably, depending on the extent of macrophage differentiation and/or functional responsiveness, the pathway of macrophage activation, the type, concentration and combination of the macrophage secretory molecules, and on whether the agents were present during induction and expression or only during expression of tumoricidal activity. In showing that IFN beta and TNF alpha were mostly enhancing and TGF beta mostly suppressive, whereas PGE2 suppressed induction but enhanced expression of tumoricidal activity, our findings provide further support for the concept that these macrophage-derived molecules have a key role in autocrine regulation of macrophage functional activities.",M2
1723083,"Inhibition of NK cell generation by Corynebacterium parvum.Treatment of mice with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) resulted in a substantial decrease of splenic NK activity associated with a reduced number of LGL. Cp also inhibited in vitro augmentation of NK cytotoxicity by IFN or IL-2 as well as generation of LAK activity. Localization experiments by using radiolabelled LGL indicated that the lower number of LGL in the spleen was not attributable to a Cp-induced alteration of LGL homing. Finally Cp was found to affect the ability of bone marrow cells to reconstitute NK activity in lethally irradiated mice, indicating that it can interfere with development of NK cells from bone marrow progenitors.",M2
2120139,"Resistance to a non-immunogenic tumor, induced by Corynebacterium parvum or Listeria monocytogenes, is abrogated by anti-interferon gamma.The complex processes that determine the outcome of the interaction of tumor and host were explored in the operationally simple and reproducible rat D-12 ascites tumor model. Animals exhibit weak spontaneous resistance against this tumor that is not augmented by repeated inoculation, by various routes, of irradiated syngeneic D-12 tumor cells, but considerably enhanced after local administration of heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) or Listeria monocytogenes (LM) organisms. Inoculation of conventional or monoclonal anti-rat IFN gamma antibodies into the same compartment did not affect spontaneous tumor resistance, but largely abrogated the tumor-protective effect triggered by CP or LM. Our findings support the concept that IFN gamma, produced by T cells in the course of the specific immune response raised against immunogenic micro-organisms, is able to enhance and to maintain local tumor resistance and thus to strengthen the capacity of the host to cope with a non-immunogenic tumor.",M2
2120138,"Mechanisms of macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing: a comparative analysis of the roles of reactive nitrogen intermediates and tumor necrosis factor.The roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) as effectors of macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing were investigated in a variety of tumor cell lines. Three TNF alpha-sensitive tumor targets were also susceptible to resting bone-marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes (BMMP). This macrophage lytic activity was markedly diminished or even abolished by anti-TNF alpha, indicating that TNF alpha is the major effector of macrophage-mediated killing of these targets. The other 21 tumor cell lines examined were resistant to TNF alpha but, in their large majority, were more or less susceptible to killing by interferon gamma (IFN gamma)- and Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>)-activated BMMP. Among the various analogues of L-arginine used to assess the role of L-arginine-derived RNI as mediators of macrophage tumoricidal activity, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA) was most efficient in suppressing RNI secretion by activated macrophages. In some macrophage tumor-cell combinations, NMMA inhibited both the generation of RNI and the expression of tumoricidal activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a central role for RNI as effectors. In other combinations, NMMA in concentrations that abolished secretion of RNI either affected tumor-cell killing only after its induction by IFN gamma, or not at all. The findings not only support the thesis that macrophages posses various means of coping with tumor cells but also suggest that the mechanism becoming operative is determined predominantly by the pathway of macrophage activation and the properties of the tumor-cell type.",M2

The effects on the growth and metastases of Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BL/6 mice were observed. Experimental results indicated that CP had significant inhibitory effect on the tumor growth and lung metastases. The cytotoxic effects of activated peritoneal macrophages in mice on target tumor cells (L5178Y) in vitro were studied with the technique of 3H-TdR assay. The proliferation of tumor cells was markedly inhibited by the activated peritoneal macrophages of CP. Experiments showed that the antitumor mechanism of CP was the mediation via activated cytotoxic macrophages. These results indicated that CP is an effective immunostimulant. These findings will provide a scientific basis for the clinical treatment of the primary and metastatic lung carcinoma.",M2
2196108,"Evaluation of the worth of corynebacterium parvum in conjunction with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for primary breast cancer. Eight-year results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-10.During the 1970s, information obtained from animal tumor models and from patients with a spectrum of solid tumors indicated the worth of a variety of immunostimulating agents. These findings provided a biological and clinical rationale for conducting randomized trials to evaluate the worth of those agents. Consequently, in May 1977 the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) implemented a randomized trial to determine whether Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum, <e>CP</e>) plus chemotherapy would be more effective than chemotherapy alone in prolonging the disease-free survival (DFS) and survival (S) of patients with primary operable breast cancer and positive axillary nodes. The results of that trial through 8 years of follow-up fail to indicate that treatment with CP used in conjunction with l-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) results in a better DFS and S than that observed after chemotherapy alone. Use of the immunomodulator has instead resulted in a poorer, but not statistically significant, outcome. Despite adjustments made to account for any imbalance in distribution of prognostic factors between the two treatment groups and despite considering treatment compliance as a factor, the unfavorable outcome persisted. A high incidence of fever and chills was associated with the administration of CP. The administration of hydrocortisone before each CP treatment reduced the frequency of those and other systemic effects. The failure to demonstrate a benefit from CP is in keeping with the failure of other nonspecific stimulating agents to contribute to the creation of a new paradigm for the treatment of breast cancer.",M2

The fatal type of interaction developed regularly as a result of the concurrent i.v. administration of the X-ray contrast substance adipiodone with the endotoxin of Shigella dys.

2148342,"Characterization of Corynebacterium parvum-induced suppressor cells of mouse NK and ADCC activity.Treatment of mice with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) resulted in a substantial decrease in natural killer activity in the spleen at 10 days. The decrease in cytotoxicity was associated with the presence of splenic nonadherent (NA) suppressor cells, capable of inhibiting natural as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The nonadherent suppressor cells appeared to be null cells, lacking detectable expression of Thy 1, L3T4 (CD4), Lyt 2 (CD8), or asialo-GM1 and could be physically separated from cells with NK activity by centrifugation on Percoll discontinuous density gradients. Our results indicate that Cp can negatively modulate cytolytic functions of NK cells by inhibiting the effector phase of cytotoxicity.",M2
2506137,"Discrepancy in the abilities of lymphokines and bacteria to mediate tumor protection in vivo and/or tumoricidal activity by macrophages in vitro.In the present study, the ability of lymphokines (MAF and IFN gamma) and microbial agents (<e>CP</e> and LM) to induce and maintain tumoricidal activity in BMMP in vitro and to enhance local resistance to the DA rat D-12 ascites tumor in vivo was assessed comparatively. Under standard conditions in vitro, i.e., when present during the 24-hr induction and the 36-hr effector phase, both lymphokines and microbes were similarly potent for eliciting tumoricidal activity in BMMP. When the activating agents were present only during the induction phase, and effector cells were interacted with tumor targets after a 24-hr interval, clear differences were observed: BMMP which had been incubated with lymphokines had largely if not completely lost their tumoricidal activity; in contrast, BMMP which had been incubated with microbes still manifested considerable tumoricidal activity. Experiments performed to assess the in vivo significance of the discrepancy established in vitro have shown that resistance to the D-12 ascites tumor was markedly enhanced after local inoculation of microbes but was affected very little or not at all by soluble lymphokines. The causes responsible for the discrepancy in the antitumor potential of lymphokines vs. microbes are probably manifold. Extensive attempts to improve the efficacy of lymphokines by repeated administration or by incorporation into liposomes were not successful.",M2

Under similar conditions, CP and LPS were shown to enhance J774-mediated tumor cell lysis.

2919485,"Modulation of hematoporphyrin derivative-sensitized phototherapy with corynebacterium parvum in murine transitional cell carcinoma.The interaction of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) and immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) was studied in a murine transitional cell carcinoma (MBT-2) model. C3H/He mice were transplanted subcutaneously in the hind limb with 2.5 X 10(5) tumor cells. One day after transplantation, mice were randomized into groups to receive saline (control), PDT, CP 25 micrograms, CP 250 micrograms, CP 25 micrograms + PDT, and CP 250 micrograms + PDT. PDT was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Hpd (12.5 micrograms/g body weight), followed twenty-four hours later by photoirradiation. CP was given intralesionally at the same time as IP injection of Hpd (24 hours before photoirradiation). A low dose of CP (25 micrograms) was shown to enhance the effect of PDT while PDT reduced the benefit obtained with high dose of CP (250 micrograms). In a second series of experiments, CP (250 micrograms) treatment after photoirradiation was shown to give significantly greater benefit than CP treatment before photoirradiation. The study thus indicates that the effectiveness of combined immunophototherapy is dependent on the sequence of the combination and its intricate relationship with the dosage of CP. The enhancement of PDT by low dose of CP in this model suggests the usefulness of this combined immunophototherapy in enhancing tumor control and in lessening deleterious side effects.",M2

A mixture of 2 X 10(6) Meth A cells and 0.1 mg CP-PER was subcutaneously inoculated into the back of donor BALB/c mice, with the result that their spleen cells showed an antitumor effect 10 to 13 days after the inoculation. These cells were used as immune cells. Recipient mice were inoculated with 1 X 10(6) Meth A cells, and 2 days later were administered cyclophosphamide. On the following day, 1 X 10(8) immune cells were adoptively transferred into the recipient mice. As a result, the tumor began to regress 7 to 12 days after the adoptive transfer. An immuno-histochemical study of the donors' spleens and the recipients' regressing tumors revealed that the ratio of L3T4+ T cells to Lyt-2+ T cells in the donors' spleens was increased and that the infiltrating cells in the recipients' tumors were mainly composed of L3T4+ T cells. This confirmed that the transfer of L3T4+ T cells led to the infiltration of L3T4+ T cells into the recipients' tumors, causing their eradication.",M2

C3H/He mice were transplanted subcutaneously in the hind limb with 5 x 10(5) tumor cells. Ten to 14 days later when the tumor reached a diameter of five to seven mm., it was surgically removed. Mice were then randomized into four groups to receive a total of three treatments on days 1, 3 and 5 after surgery: 1) saline (control group); 2) CP, 250 micrograms. into the surgical site; 3) CDDP, 5 micrograms./gm. body weight intraperitoneally; and 4) combined CP and CDDP. Recurrence of tumor occurred in 70%, 52%, 55% and 28% of mice receiving surgery only, CP, CDDP, and combined CP and CDDP respectively. In the second part of the experiment, phagocytic activity using chemiluminescence assay and natural killer (NK) activity using chromium-51 release assay were determined with cells from the peritoneum, spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. CP or CDDP alone enhanced the phagocytic and NK activity. The most significant enhancement was obtained with cells from the inguinal lymph nodes of mice receiving combined CP and CDDP, the group with the lowest tumor recurrence. These results suggest that combination of CP and CDDP may be useful in control of postsurgical recurrence of bladder cancer.",M2

Of the 53 effusions, 24 were metastases from lung cancer and 29 from breast cancer. Complete response (CR) was assessed as total resolution of pleural effusion after explorative thoracentesis. The results were as follows: 15 CR after two injections of CP, 30 CR after three, and 5 CR after the fourth administration. Three of 53 cases could not be evaluated because of early death. Of the 30 clearly haemorragic effusions, 25 turned into serofibrinosis after the first intrapleural injection of CP and the other five after the second. These findings indicate that intracavitary CP is the most adequate treatment for the control of neoplastic pleural effusion because it induces a significant clinical improvement with milder side effects with respect to other drugs and/or physical agents commonly used.",M2
2835568,"Bone marrow derived macrophages have polyamine and ectoenzyme phenotypes distinct from resident macrophages.Several prototype macrophage (MO) populations were compared for differences in ectoenzyme phenotype and polyamine content. Resident peritoneal MO and Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>)-activated peritoneal MO expressed unique ectoenzyme phenotypes, while bone marrow derived MO (BMDMO), obtained from stem cells after 7 days in culture with colony stimulating factor, and thioglycollate (TG)-elicited peritoneal MO exhibited a similar ectoenzyme phenotype. All of the MO populations, however, differed in polyamine accumulation patterns. These results suggest that ectoenzyme phenotypes do not serve as completely selective markers of MO differentiation. Moreover, BMDMO do not resemble steady state tissue peritoneal MO but appear to resemble inflammatory MO in several respects. Therefore activated BMDMO do not appear to provide an accurate model system for their continued use in studies to characterize the development of resident tissue MO.",M2
2887687,"Mechanism of decline of natural killer cell activity in Corynebacterium parvum-treated mice: inhibition by erythroblasts and Thy 1.2+ lymphocytes.Injection of (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 mice with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), iv, resulted in a depression of splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity 7-17 days after treatment. This decline in reactivity was accompanied by an increase in splenic tumor-binding cells and a decrease in cytotoxic tumor-binding cells as evaluated in a single-cell assay. Morphologic analysis indicated that the increased tumor-binding cells following CP injection were due to erythroblasts binding to YAC-1 tumor cells. With the use of a double-fluorescent binding technique, nonlytic tumor-binding cells of CP-treated mice inhibited NK cytotoxicity of normal syngeneic mice by competing with effectors for binding to tumor cells. Removal of erythroblasts by hypotonic shock treatment eliminated this competition and significantly improved the lytic capacity of CP-treated mice, thus indicating that erythroblasts contributed to the suppression of NK activity in these mice. The presence of a second inhibitory mechanism in CP-treated mice was found following asialo GM1 treatment or Percoll density gradient separation of erythroblast-depleted CP splenocytes; this inhibitory population was identified as Thy 1.2+ lymphocytes. Further analysis of the mechanism of suppression indicated that it was mediated by a soluble factor. In addition to the presence of suppressor cells, CP-treated mice displayed a decrease in splenic large granular lymphocyte content, which may also contribute to their NK deficiency.",M2
3118558,"Incomplete surgery, local immunostimulation, and recurrence of some tumour types in dogs and cats.Histologically confirmed inadequate treatment resulted in a lower than expected recurrence percentage in dogs with haemangiopericytoma (38%) and mastocytoma (30%). Clinical suspicion of inadequate tumour treatment did not always correlate with the histologically assessed inadequacy, nor with the appearance of local recurrence. Local recurrence did not seem to be correlated with histological grade of malignancy and tumour size. Local injection of C. parvum vaccine did not result in a lower percentage of local recurrence or longer recurrence-free intervals in any of the three tumour groups (canine haemangiopericytoma, canine mastocytoma, feline mammary carcinoma). Nor was palliative local adjuvant injection of <e>Cp</e> successful in dogs and cats with soft tissue sarcomas or in dogs with gingival melanoma. Re-operation of locally recurrent tumour was successful in some dogs with haemangiopericytoma, in a few with mastocytoma, but not in cats with mammary carcinoma. A trend toward histological progression of recurrences and metastases, when compared with the primary tumours, was not evident. The possible reasons for the relatively low recurrence rate of some tumour types and for the failure of Cp-treatment are discussed.",M2
3553610,"Immunomodulators and wound healing.The synthetic immunomodulators muramyl dipeptide (MDP), thymopoietin pentapeptide (TP5), and <e>CP</e>-46,665 were examined for their effects on wound healing in mice. We found no differences in wound disruption strength between immunomodulator-treated animals and saline controls on days 11, 14, and 21. The only exception was with high-dose CP-46,665, which produced weakened wounds on day 14 (p less than 0.05) and 21 (p less than 0.01). CP-46,665 was further studied by injecting high and low doses 48 hours before or after wounding. No differences were seen for these groups compared to controls at 11 and 21 days. Finally, to simulate a common clinical situation, mice were subjected to a 10% total body surface area (TBSA) burn to the right paraspinal region. Twenty-four hours later, a left paraspinal incision was performed with simultaneous injection of saline, Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum), or low-dose TP-5, MDP, or CP-46,665. At 11 days, no detriment in wound healing was found for burned control or any of the immunomodulator-treated animals except in the C. parvum-treated mice, with significantly weakened skin strips (p less than 0.001). While C. parvum may be detrimental to wound healing, the synthetic modulators tested appear to have little effect on wound healing.",M2
3494802,"Tumor-specific T-lymphocyte cytotoxicity enhanced by low dose of C. parvum.Three routes of immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) on an ascitic Friend virus-induced leukemia were evaluated. Only the intraperitoneal route, which provided optimal contact between CP and tumor cells, showed prolonged mean survival time. Greatest effectiveness was obtained with multiple injections of CP at weekly intervals and with small initial tumor load. Of particular interest was that lower dosages of CP (5 and 25 micrograms) gave longer protection than dosages of 50 and 250 micrograms. Using in vitro 125I-iododeoxyuridine release assay, these lower dosages were shown to selectively enhance the cytotoxicity associated with T lymphocytes, whereas higher dosages appeared to primarily augment the activity of phagocytes. Moderate natural killer cell activity was observed with both the lower and higher dosages of CP. Data from this study indicate that route of administration, dosage of CP, and size of tumor burden are crucial variables determining optimal response to immunotherapy.",M2

Female C3H/He mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Two X 10(5) MBT-2 cells were delivered into the bladder transurethrally using a small catheter, immediately after the posterior wall of the bladder had been electrocauterized. Bladder tumor became palpable or demonstrable microscopically in two weeks. Immunotherapy with BCG (2 X 10(6) CFU), CP (250 micrograms), KLH (50 micrograms), or AS (25 mg) was administered directly into the bladder via urethral catheter on day 1, day 6, or days 1 and 6. On day 21 the bladders and spleens were excised and weighed, and the bladders were examined macroscopically and microscopically for evidence of tumor. The results of the study showed that two treatments given one and six days after tumor transplant yielded the lowest tumor incidence and that CP and AS appeared equally effective or even slightly more effective than BCG in this model. These results suggest that clinical evaluation of CP or AS may be worthwhile.",M2
3583504,"Suppression of basal and Corynebacterium parvum-augmented NK activity during chemically induced tumor development.C3H mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with a tumorigenic dose (150 micrograms/mouse) of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), followed by a 24-h injection and subsequent weekly injections of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) i.p. for a total of 100 days. Basal and CP-augmented NK cell activities were measured in controls and treatment groups during pre-tumor and tumor development stages. Basal NK activity in spleen, peripheral blood and lung tissue was enhanced by CP, but was suppressed by MC. A resulting transient MC induced suppression of splenic NK activity at 10 days was partially restored and sustained by CP treatment and immunosuppression was again observed in tumor-bearing compared to control mice. Mice treated with MC alone showed a higher tumor incidence than animals treated with MC + CP at 45-60 days, while there was no difference in tumor incidence in these two treatment groups at 100 days post injection. The mechanism of the observed transient immunosuppression induced by MC appears to be related to an early toxic effect on large granular lymphocytes (LGL) which was decreased at 10 days and again at 100 days in tumor-bearing mice. Although MC did not appear to exert an effect on effector:target cell conjugate formation, an early suppression in the lytic activity of LGL, may have predisposed the animal to malignant transformation of susceptible cells at the site of MC injection.",M2
3102062,"In vitro and in vivo release of cytostatic factors from Lactobacillus casei-elicited peritoneal macrophages after stimulation with tumor cells and immunostimulants.The effect of tumor cells and immunostimulants on the release of cytostatic factors (CF) from Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC)-, Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>)- or peptone-elicited peritoneal macrophages (PM) was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Significant release of CF into the culture medium from PM elicited with LC was induced by seven of eight mitomycin C-pretreated tumor cell lines and not by normal spleen cells, while no CF was released extracellularly from peptone-elicited PM given the same stimulus. CF were released from LC-elicited PM (LCEPM) after stimulation with LC, bacille Calmette-Guérin, streptococcal preparation OK-432, fucoidan or lipopolysaccharide, and LC but not CP induced CF production in the peritoneal cavities of LC- or CP-primed mice. The release of CF from LCEPM after stimulation with mitomycin C-pretreated 3T12-3 cells was inhibited by D-mannose and not by L-fucose. L-Rhamnose and mannose 6-phosphate, but not D-mannose or L-fucose, caused the release of CF from the PM. It was suggested that the release of CF from activated PM is caused by stimulation by some tumor cells, sugars, or bacterial immunostimulants, D-Mannose and L-rhamnose on the surface of tumor cells or bacteria, respectively, may plan an important role in the release of CF from activated macrophages.",M2
3020680,"The role of superoxide anion and lysosomal enzymes in anti-listerial activity of elicited peritoneal macrophages.The in vitro effect of superoxide anion and lysosomal enzyme activity on the killing of Listeria monocytogenes EGD (listeria) by peritoneal macrophages (PM) was investigated. Generation of superoxide anion by PM stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was significantly increased by intraperitoneal injection of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018) or Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), but not by injection of peptone. However, superoxide anion generation by LC9018-elicited PM stimulated with listeria was not increased any more than that by peptone-elicited PM, and generation of superoxide anion by the PM was affected by the difference in stimuli. The killing of listeria by LC9018- or CP-elicited PM in vitro was significantly less than that by peptone-elicited PM or resident PM. Significant correlation was observed between the anti-listerial activity of PM and the intracellular killing of listeria by PM. On the other hand, beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activities of LC9018-elicited, CP-elicited, or resident PM were significantly weaker than those of peptone-elicited PM, and no significant correlation was observed between the increase in beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activities and the increase in anti-listerial activity. These results suggest that increase in the activity of lysosomal enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase is not correlated with the anti-listerial activity of PM, and that superoxide anion has very little effect on the anti-listerial activity of PM in vitro.",M2
3735559,"Superiority of intralesional immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum and Allium sativum in control of murine transitional cell carcinoma.Immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and an extract of Allium sativum (AS) was studied in a transitional cell carcinoma (MBT-2) in mice. Comparison was made between intraperitoneal (IP) versus intralesional (IL) administration of these agents. C3H/He mice were transplanted subcutaneously in the hind limb with 5 X 10(4) tumor cells. After transplantation, mice were randomized into groups to receive either IP or IL treatments with BCG (2 X 10(6) CFU), CP (250 micrograms.), KLH (50 micrograms.) or AS (25 mg.). At weekly intervals the tumor volume was determined. To assess the local cellular events following these treatments, histopathological studies were performed 10 days after tumor transplant with tissues removed from the injected sites. IL route was much more effective than IP route in inhibiting tumor growth. CP and AS exhibited more significant therapeutic effect than BCG or KLH. No tumor developed in mice which received five IL treatments of CP or AS. The data indicate that CP or AS may serve as effective biological response modifiers in controlling transitional cell carcinoma. The study further emphasizes that route and frequency of administration are crucial variables determining efficacy of immunotherapy.",M2
2426209,"Aspartate-assisted immune stimulation: its importance in antitumor and antiviral protection.Immune stimulators such as Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) are useful for antitumoral and antiviral therapy. However, the immune trigger cannot be reactivated without adversely affecting the disease. We have tried to amplify the results yielded by a single injection of CP by using either interleukin-2 (IL2) or aspartate salts (ASP). In the present report, we show that IL2 has no detectable clinical effect. In contrast, the addition of an ASP salt increases the antiviral and antitumoral protection afforded by the CP-induced trigger. Moreover, treatment using only ASP slightly protects against tumor development and significantly increases antiviral resistance during experimental encephalomyocarditis (EMC) infection. This ASP-assisted CP immune stimulation improves antitumoral resistance even when ascitic tumors have already developed. In the latter case, tumor regression can even be detected. Since ASP increases T-cell cytotoxicity in vitro and aggravates spontaneous T-cell lymphomas in AKR mice, the involvement of T-cell-mediated immunity may explain antitumoral and antiviral effects. We propose the use of this therapeutic model for human cancer therapy, and possibly for treating AIDS.",M2
3490910,"Incidence and growth of methylcholanthrene-induced tumors in mice with altered immunological status.BALB/c mice were treated s.c. with 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), and tumor incidence and growth were followed for 9 months. Immunological status of mice was altered by various treatments. Thymectomized, lethally irradiated, bone marrow reconstituted mice served as T-cell deficient recipients. In order to suppress natural killer (NK)-cell/macrophage functions some mice were injected with silica particles; to enhance these functions some mice were given Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). Silica and CP were given simultaneously with MCA to test their influence on the presumed function of surveillance of tumor incidence, and also 2 months after MCA to test their influence on the growth of greater numbers of transformed host cells. Almost all mice developed tumors at the inoculation site and at the end of the observation period there was no difference in tumor incidence among 9 experimental groups. However, in T-cell deficient mice we observed shorter tumor duration and earlier death than in normal mice. Silica particles appeared to enhance tumor growth but the differences compared to normal controls were not significant. A single injection of CP simultaneously with MCA caused earlier tumor appearance but also slowed its growth. In contrast, CP given 2 months after MCA significantly delayed the appearance of the tumors. In regard to the tumor growth immunosuppression had stronger effects in males than in females; the opposite was true for immunostimulation treatments. We concluded that immunological status does not influence long-term tumor incidence, but that both T-cell and NK-cell/macrophage compartments strongly influence the parameters of growth of chemically induced tumors, i.e., the immune and natural resistance mechanisms do not influence the frequency of de novo arising tumors but both can slow down tumor growth.",M2
2935247,"Suppression of murine NK activity induced by Corynebacterium parvum: further characterization and abrogation of suppressor cells.Formalin-killed Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), given at a dose of 0.4-0.7 mg/mouse IV or IP, induced suppressor cells for NK activity in B6C3F1 mice. The suppressor cells belong to at least two different populations, plastic adherent and nonadherent, and were not depleted by antibodies specific for Thy-1.2, Iak, or NK-1.2 surface markers. Administration of p-I:C, an interferon-inducer, to animals 18 h before the assay did not affect the suppressor activity. Hypotonic shock treatment of splenocytes abrogated the in vitro suppressive activity, and subsequent reconstitution of the shock-treated cells with RBC failed to restore the suppressive activity. SJL/J mice, which have low NK activity, exhibited suppressor activity comparable to B6C3F1 mice following CP treatment, whereas CP-treated BALB/c athymic and euthymic mice showed a lower ability to generate suppressors for NK as compared to B6C3F1 mice.",M2
4067308,"The effect of hemopoietic microenvironment on splenic suppressor macrophages in congenitally anemic mice of genotype Sl/Sld.Mechanisms underlying mononuclear phagocyte specialization are being probed by studying suppressor macrophages (M phi) as a reference population in mouse models with impaired blood monocyte formation. Splenic suppressor M phi, defined by PGE-mediated inhibition of Con A-induced T lymphocyte proliferation are induced by the i.p. administration of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). Mice severely depleted of bone marrow and blood monocytes by treatment with 89Sr fail to show this suppressor M phi response to CP, although M phi-forming stem cells, assessed as splenic M-CFC in vitro, are increased 20-fold. These observations suggest that radiosensitive bone marrow stem cells are necessary for the generation of both suppressor M phi and monocytes and that one such stem cell may be common to both types of mononuclear phagocytes. This notion was explored further by employing congenitally anemic mice of the genotype S1/S1d in which the hemopoietic microenvironment is genetically defective and thus unable to support the proliferation, differentiation, and function of stem cells. The congenital defect was found to be additionally expressed in the S1/S1d mouse by a monocytopenia of less than 10% of the values in normal congenic littermate controls and by the failure of splenic M-CFC to increase in response to CP. PGE-producing suppressor M phi expressing Fc gamma 2b receptors, however, were induced by CP in S1/S1d mice with no significant diminution of suppressor activity. These data establish the fact that significant impairment of the formation of monocytes is part of the overall hemopoietic defect in S1/S1d mice. PGE-producing suppressor M phi, however, were inducible at normal functional levels in the presence of a profound monocytopenia, and therefore appear to be independent of the mechanisms that regulate blood monocyte formation. Ablation of the bone marrow with 89Sr resulted in failure of CP to induce suppressor M phi in the spleens of the S1/S1d mice as in the littermate controls. Other observations in the present study, when taken with data from the 89Sr model, show the additional independence of these suppressor M phi from splenic M-CFC. In aggregate, these findings delineate three functionally definable populations of mononuclear phagocytes that appear to be independently regulated.",M2
2933455,"The effect of bone marrow depletion on prostaglandin E-producing suppressor macrophages in mouse spleen.The i.p. injection of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) into CBA/J mice effected increases in macrophage colony-forming cells (M-CFC) when spleen cells were cultured with L cell culture filtrate as a source of colony-stimulating factor. Significant increases in phagocytic macrophages (M phi) with Fc receptors for IgG2a and IgG2b immune complexes were additionally noted among the spleen cells in these mice. These M phi effectively inhibited Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation, probably reflecting a 10-fold increase above normal controls in prostaglandin E to 47 ng/3 X 10(6) spleen cells/ml. To determine whether the suppressor M phi are immediate derivatives of splenic M-CFC, we tried to induce suppressor M phi by the injection of CP into mice depleted of bone marrow M-CFC by the earlier administration of the bone-seeking isotope, 89Sr. This procedure reduced M-CFC in the bone marrow to less than 1% of normal for more than 30 days. Monocytes in the blood fell to 5% of normal by day 10 and were 30% on day 30. Levels of resident peritoneal M phi showed relatively little change in this period. By contrast, splenic M-CFC increased to 20-fold higher than the  cold  88Sr controls. CP-induced suppressor M phi activity, however, was sharply reduced in 89Sr marrow-depleted mice on day 10, despite the striking increase in M-CFC. There was a threefold increase in the number of phagocytic M phi binding IgG2a immune complexes, with no significant increase in IgG2b binding M phi. The kinetics of recovery of suppressor M phi activity showed that on days 20, 30, and 50 after 89Sr injection the activities reached 20%, 30%, and 70% of the  cold  control, respectively, and correlated with the recovery of significant levels of M-CFC in the bone marrow. Taken together, these observations suggest that splenic M-CFC are not an immediate source of PGE-suppressor M phi in vivo. It appears more likely that the CP-inducible suppressor M phi, in particular, originate from radiosensitive bone marrow cells or require for differentiation a microenvironment provided by bone marrow cells. The data also suggest that the expression of the Fc gamma 2b receptor and of suppressor activity by CP-induced splenic M phi are related phenomena.",M2
3841363,"A sustained increase of microsomal heme oxygenase activity following treatment of rats with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and Corynebacterium parvum: its possible relation to the decrease of cytochrome P-450 content.The alterations of various enzymes responsible for drug metabolism and heme metabolism were examined in the liver of female rats treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). Hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme activities and microsomal cytochrome P-450 and b5 content were significantly decreased for up to 15 and 10 d by a single i.v. administration of BCG and CP, respectively. In contrast, microsomal heme oxygenase activity was markedly increased after BCG and CP treatment and the increased enzyme activity was sustained in parallel with the decrease of drug metabolizing enzymes. Both BCG and CP also caused a significant decrease of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity shortly after their administrations. The decreased enzyme activity returned to normal levels by 12 h after the treatment of rats with BCG and CP. In addition, hepatosplenomegaly was observed in BCG and CP treated rats. Dose related changes of these microsomal enzymes were seen following the administration of BCG and CP. Additionally, there were sex differences in the effects of BCG and CP on the alteration of microsomal enzymes, female rats being more sensitive than male rats. These results suggest that the decrease of cytochrome P-450 and b5 content and drug metabolizing enzyme activities by BCG and CP could be related, at least in part, to the prolonged increase of heme oxygenase activity, that may lead to the increased breakdown of heme available for the synthesis of these hemoproteins.",M2
3930066,"Cytotoxic factor production by Kupffer cells elicited with Lactobacillus casei and Corynebacterium parvum.The ability of Kupffer cells, spleen macrophages, pulmonary macrophages, and peritoneal macrophages (PM) to produce cytotoxic factor (CTF) was investigated in vitro.

In addition, oxygen radical (OR) production by Kupffer cells or PM was measured. The production of OR by Kupffer cells or PM was significantly augmented by i.v. or i.p. injection of LC9018 or CP. No significant correlation was observed between the increase in OR production by Kupffer cells or PM and CTF production by Kupffer cells or PM elicited with either organism. It was suggested that activated Kupffer cells may be one important source of CTF production in serum and that the CTF-producing macrophages may be different from the OR-producing macrophages.",M2

A dose related increase in NK could be demonstrated with peaks in NK at day 1 with full <e>Cp</e> dosage and at day 14 with 50% doses. This increase was attributable to the Cp vaccine since normal donors receiving tetanus toxoid or pneumococcal polysaccharide and AML patients randomized not to receive Cp did not show similar NK boosting. The increase was probably due to interferon induction in vivo and could be demonstrated with purified T- and non-T-lymphocyte subsets. However, longitudinal measurements showed that the ability of Cp to boost NK was gradually lost over 4-6 months. ADCC studies showed that while lymphocyte-ADCC was not consistently affected by Cp, monocyte-ADCC was enhanced with maximal cytotoxicity at day 14.",M2
3847288,"Evaluation of in vivo and in vitro effectivity of immune defense against a spontaneously arising, nonlymphoid rat tumor. I. Analysis of natural immune defense.Possible mechanisms of natural defense against a nonimmunogenic, nonlymphoid rat tumor were evaluated in vitro and examined for effectivity in vivo, using BSp6S, the subcutaneously grown transplantation line of a spontaneously arising fibrosarcoma in the BDX rat strain, which is highly susceptible to natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages (Mø). The role of nonspecific immune defense in vivo was demonstrated by eliminating NK cells by irradiation and Mø by silica treatment. Especially after depletion of NK cells a significant acceleration of tumor growth and a reduction in the number of cells required for tumor takes was observed. Activation of Mø by Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) did lead to retardation of tumor growth; prevention of tumor growth was only achieved after inoculation of a marginal dose of tumor cells. Activation of NK cells was of minor influence.

We investigated the potential benefit of immune stimulation for preventing infection in such conditions in an animal model by evaluating three drugs: Corynebacterium parvum, thymopentin (TP-5), and <e>CP</e>-46,665. One-hundred eighty female guinea pigs were rendered immunodeficient by first inflicting a 30% total body surface burn and then placing the animals on diets with calories inadequate to maintain body weight. One half of the animals were then given one of the three immunomodulators on the first, third, and fifth days after burn injury, to try to reverse immunodeficiency. The remaining animals received saline solution injections. Animal responses were evaluated by inserting a clot containing Escherichia coli and Bacillus fragilis into their peritoneal cavity 6 days after burn injury. The animals were followed for 21 days after burn injury. Autopsies on those that died revealed peritonitis and/or pneumonia; autopsies on these that survived showed no pneumonia and there was consistent resolution of peritonitis. TP-5 and CP-46,665, but not C. parvum, significantly improved survival rates and mean survival time in those animals receiving 100 kcal/kg/day.

6235074,"Paradoxical presence of T cell anergy during successful T cell-dependent tumour immunotherapy: characterization of a state of T cell 'amnaesia' following systemic administration of C. parvum.Systemic administration of Corynebacterium parvum causes T cell-dependent regression of an established methylcholanthrene-induced murine fibrosarcoma beginning 10 days after <e>Cp</e> injection. At this time, tumour specific effector T cell responses measured by reactivity in a T helper cell assay or in a Winn assay disappear only to return later. We refer to this temporary lapse in T cell reactivity as immunological 'amnaesia'. Antigen specific T cell responses within all lymphoid organs appear to be affected. The 'amnaesic' state is characterised by the presence of primed T cells but the absence of T effector cells and suppressor cells. The differentiation of the primed T cells is blocked probably as a result on the non-delivery of a differentiation signal. There are several possible mechanisms which could account for this; the one we prefer is that cells are prevented from entering T cell-dependent cell interaction areas within lymphoid organs. This state of T cell 'amnaesia' may underlie anergy in some inflammatory, infectious and neoplastic diseases. The apparent paradox of T cell-dependent tumour regression occurring in mice with depressed T cell responses is discussed.",M2

All patients were treated once a month with six cycles of VAC- (vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy, followed by FMC (5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide) until progression was documented. By random assignment, the patients received immunostimulation with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) by one of four methods: subcutaneous (SC) on either day 1 or day 14, intravenous (IV) on either day 1 or day 14. The 214 evaluable patients were equally distributed to the four arms. The rates of complete or partial response to VAC/FMC plus CP did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Of our patients, 22-33% were definite treatment failures. The Kaplan-Meier curves of duration of remission (medians 14 vs. 9 vs. 13 vs. 11 months) did not differ significantly. Only small differences in survival were noted among the four study groups (medians 15.4 vs. 17.5 vs. 17.2 vs. 13.0 months). However, complete and partial responders lived significantly longer (Log rank test P = 0.008), when CP was given on day 14 by the SC rather than IV route (29+ vs. 14.3 months). Patients in the four study groups were treated with virtually identical doses of VAC/FMC chemotherapy. Patients receiving CP intravenously on day 14 experienced significantly lower mean leukocyte counts than patients in the other groups.

During and after the 12-week BNU exposure the spontaneous NK cell activity against YAC-1 cells and that arising 4 days after stimulation with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) were measured, as were the mitogen responses of splenic T and B cells. In addition to BNU, groups of mice received multiple injections of the interferon inducer CP during or after the BNU exposure period. The results show a slight impairment of the NK cell activity by BNU and also after the injections of CP depending heavily on the treatment protocol. After the multiple injections of CP, either into BNU-treated mice or into controls, no further stimulation by CP was possible. The mitogen responses, reduced after BNU, were further reduced after the additional treatment. Both effects can be explained by the known induction of suppressor cells by CP. Although these treatments had pronounced effects on the parameters tested in vitro there was no significant influence on the development of thymic lymphomas in vivo.",M2

Only saponin was found to be effective. Promotion did not correlate with the ability to promote a particular Ig isotype; however, saponin was unique in its ability to promote cell-mediate immunity against the 90K glycoprotein.",M2
6193071,"Effect of coordinated therapeutic assays using C. parvum, interferon and arginine butyrate on spontaneous disease and survival of AKR mice.AKR mice, known to develop spontaneous leukemia in almost 100% of cases, were studied throughout their life-span. Different treatments combining a potent immune stimulator, Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), with interferon (IFN) and arginine butyrate were initiated at the 15th week of life. In a preliminary series of experiments, CP (200 micrograms), IFN (20,000 units) and butyrate 50 mM) were employed in a well-defined chronological order. In controls, the mean survival time (MST) was 35.17 +/- 1.67 weeks and the final survival rates was 0/50 mice for all experiments. Only CP associated with arginine butyrate significantly augmented the MST (42.5 +/- 3.66 weeks) and final survival rate (9/35 mice). In an adjusted set of experiments, reducing the IFN concentration to 10,000 and 5,000 units and that of butyrate to 6 mM greatly improved the results. The MST was substantially increased with the combinations of CP + IFN + butyrate (41.4 +/- 1.86 weeks), CP + IFN (42.73 +/- 3.29 weeks) and butyrate + IFN (41 +/- 2.34 weeks), as well as the final survival rates (8/15, 10/15 and 6/15 mice respectively). An important finding was that when CP and IFN were used separately, they were ineffective.",M2
6624533,"Effects of the removal of the primary tumor and immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum on metastatic tumor proliferation.The effects of surgical intervention by removal of the primary focus, and the effectiveness of an immunomodulator, Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>), on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue were investigated by following the postoperative changes in the 3H-thymidine labelling rate of metastatic tissue in an experimental model of metastasis in mice. In addition, the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (DTH) was studied to investigate the immune capacity of the host. The labelling rate of mice that had the primary focus removed remained high with little variation, while that of the mice not operated on decreased gradually. On the other hand, in mice undergoing a sham operation, the rate was the same as that of the mice with the primary focus removed for a short while, but then gradually decreased. When Cp was administered, especially before removal of the primary focus, the rate was lower than that of the tumor bearing control group and decreased steadily. The number of pulmonary metastatic nodules was increased by removal of the primary focus, but this increase was inhibited by the administration of Cp which prolonged life. The depression in the DTH was less in the group given Cp preoperativeLy than in either the group of mice having the primary focus removed or those not having it removed.",M2
6676630,"[The effects of surgical intervention and removal of the primary tumor, and the effectiveness of Corynebacterium parvum on metastatic tumor proliferation]The effects of surgical intervention and removal of the primary tumor, and the effectiveness of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue were investigated by using autoradiography to follow post-operative changes in the 3H-thymidine labelling rate of metastatic tissue in an experimental model of metastasis in mice. In addition, the delayed hypersensitivity reaction and the cytotoxicity (ADCC, NK) of lung cells were studied, to investigate the immune capacity of the host. The effect of surgical intervention on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue was only transitory, while removal of the primary tumor caused the continuous proliferation of remnant foci. This indicated that the primary tumor controlled the metastatic proliferation. C. parvum is an effective immunomodulator ; hence, when given before removal of the primary focus, it inhibited the formation and the continuing proliferation of remnant metastatic foci, and maintained the immune capacity of the host.",M2
6603412,"Solid tumor-derived target cell susceptibility to macrophages and natural killer/natural cytotoxic cells in the rat.Cytotoxic capacity of rat macrophages (M phi) and natural killer (NK)/natural cytotoxic cells (NC) against adherent growing, solid tumor-derived target cells was evaluated, modulating the activation status of effector cells and growth conditions of target cells. Testing a panel of target cells, cytotoxicity of NK/NC and M phi was strikingly correlated so that besides of target-cell binding structures basic lysability seems to be of influence with respect to cytotoxicity rates. Varying the in vivo growth conditions of target cells altered their lysability by M phi and NK/NC cells in the sense that ascitic versus subcutaneously (sc) grown tumors were more resistant to lysis. On the other hand, in vitro culturing did not influence susceptibility for M phi, but with some tumor lines increased lysis by NK/NC cells was observed. In the rat, the activation status of M phi and NC was not age-dependent, and NK cell activity only declined slowly with age. But cytotoxic potential of M phi obviously presents a strain characteristic, different from NK/NC cell activity, only the latter two correlating in different rat strains. Experiments to augment natural cytotoxic capacity revealed that application of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) activated M phi and NK/NC cells, while sc tumor implantation only resulted in increased NK/NC cell cytotoxicity, leaving M phi unaltered.",M2
6219754,"Role of Corynebacterium parvum in the activation of peritoneal macrophages. II. Identification of distinguishable anti-tumor activities by macrophage subpopulations.Two different mechanisms of murine macrophage (MP) antitumor activity are described in this report. C. parvum-activated peritoneal MPs were tested for cytotoxic and cytostatic activity 4 days after ip immunization. Cytotoxic activity could be distinguished from cytostatic activity using two different assay protocols. When MPs were separated by 1g velocity sedimentation, cytotoxic MPs were confined to high velocity fractions. In contrast, cytostatic MPs were found in cell fractions with velocities as low as 5.2 mm/hr. These two MP activities were also distinguishable by culturing at 37 degrees C for 24 hr. Cytotoxicity was abrogated when MPs were incubated in MEM, or MEM supplemented with lymphokine (LK) or indomethacin. In contrast, cytostasis remained at high levels when the cells were incubated with LK or indomethacin. Cytotoxicity was not retained after overnight culture even if LPS was present, or if various spleen or non-adherent peritoneal exudate cells were cocultured with the cytotoxic effector cells. Assays done to determine the presence of suppressor cells failed to find any inhibitory cell type. The phagocytic index, acid phosphatase activity, and H2O2 secretion were also measured before and after overnight culture. Acid phosphatase and phagocytic activities did not decline whereas H2O2 secretion declined significantly. These data indicate that in response to C. parvum, at least two different effector cell types with distinct antitumor activities are generated. Cytotoxicity, like the ability of cells to secrete H2O2, is found to be a short-lived function of <e>CP</e> stimulated MPs. In contrast, cytostasis is a function retained longer by MPs in culture.",M2

The number of patients was insufficient to provide a decisive result, but analysis 6 years after the last patient was admitted shows that the adjuvant therapy certainly did not shorten, and may well have prolonged, survival. Of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma who were alive 1 year after operation all except one in the C. parvum-treated group were alive 4 years later, whereas five in the control group died during this interval. Judgement concerning the value of IV administration of <e>CP</e> as adjuvant therapy in patients with operable lung cancer should be deferred until further evidence is available.",M2

The depressed levels of NK activity noted in this study depended on time of CP administration and were associated with the induction of suppressor cell activity. Neonatally thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice had unimpaired ability to generate suppressor cells following CP treatment. Depletion of adherent/phagocytic cells by carbonyl iron plus magnetism, Sephadex G-10 filtration, or both neither enriched NK activity nor removed suppressor activity from the spleens of CP-treated mice. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against lymphoma targets was also depressed in CP-treated mice, accompanied by a concomitant appearance of suppressor cells that interfere with ADCC at the effector level.",M2
6299190,"Effect of cyclosporin A on the production of interferon by human peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro.Cyclosporin A (CsA) was assessed for its effect on the production of antiviral activity by human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). CsA markedly reduced the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to stimulation with lectin mitogens, bacterial products, alloantigens, or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). CsA-mediated suppression of IFN-gamma secretion was dose-dependent and did not result from a shift of kinetics of the production of antiviral activity. The production of IFN-alpha in response to stimulation with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), viruses, and synthetic polynucleotides was not affected by the addition of CsA. These findings confirm earlier observations that CsA predominantly acts on T lymphocyte function. CsA may prove a valuable agent to study the role of IFN-gamma in the pathogenesis of virus-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disease.",M2
7150473,"Morphology of draining lymph nodes after local immune stimulation with C. parvum: comparison of pelvic nodes in carcinoma of cervix and popliteal and inguinal nodes of guinea-pig.Morphological changes are described in pelvic lymph nodes excised 10 days after C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) treatment of patients with cervical carcinoma. Guinea-pig popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were investigated from Days 1 to 10 after an injection of 70 micrograms CP into the footpad. Eosinophils were detected from the first few hours after stimulation, initially in the marginal sinus, then in the medullary sinuses and subsequently in the efferent lymphatics. From Day 2 to Day 6, histiocyte accumulations with the appearance of epithelioid cells were found mainly in subcapsular and interfollicular areas, and small granulomas were also seen in the paracortex. The granuloma formation in the lymph node was considered as an indication of the activation of histiocytes. Besides small granulomas in the paracortex, activated interdigitating cells, surrounded by scattered lymphoblasts and eosinophils, were also present. We considered this lymphoblastic response and eosinophilic accumulation as likely to be due to blastogenic factor and eosinophil stimulation promotor. Eight to 10 days after CP stimulation, the macrophage lymphoblast eosinophil response was replaced by a B-cell reaction: germinal-centre activation and medullary plasma cells. Such a B-cell reaction was also found in the human pelvic nodes removed at operation, but this reaction could not be attributed to CP treatment alone, since cervical-carcinoma patients not treated with CP also showed such reactions. In contrast, pelvic lymph nodes removed at necropsy from females killed in traffic accidents showed no predominance of either B- or T-cell stimulation.",M2

All patients were treated monthly with vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC) six times, followed by 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide (FMC) until progression was documented. By random assignment, the patients received 5 mg/m2 Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) subcutaneously on day 1, in addition to VAC/FMC. Of the 150 evaluable patients, 33 of 76 (45%) and 36 of 74 (49%) had complete or partial response to VAC/FMC plus CP, respectively. The Kaplan-Maier curves of duration of remission and survival were almost identical (medians 14.5 vs 12.1 months and 22.2 vs 21.1 months, respectively). The hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were also similar in the two study groups. However, 19 of 74 (26%) patients developed skin ulcers after repeated injections of CP. These patients showed prolonged survival (P = 0.002, log rank test). These results suggest that adding nonspecific immunostimulation with CP to currently available chemotherapy on day 1 is of no benefit to most patients with metastatic breast cancer, but may select an  immunoreactive subgroup with increased local toxicity and survival.",M2
6282455,"Chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy with levamisole or Corynebacterium parvum in advanced lung cancer.A total of 109 patients with advanced lung cancer, all cell types, were randomized between MACC chemotherapy only, consisting of methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), cyclophosphamide, and lomustine (CCNU); MACC plus levamisole (LMS) orally; and MACC plus Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) sc. Of these patients, 101 were evaluable, with no differences among the three treatment groups for overall response rate and survival time. Objective response rates and median survival times were 41% and 230 days for patients given MACC only, 39% and 257 days for those given MACC plus LMS, and 44% and 223 days for those given MACC plus CP, respectively. There was a significant increase in survival for patients with large cell anaplastic carcinoma receiving CP or LMS, particularly in the good-performance-status category. Pretreatment delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to recall antigens in 50 patients had prognostic significance, but repeat tests after 2 months of treatment in 30 patients did not show different patterns of conversion among the three groups. There was no difference in hematologic toxicity among the three groups. With the possible exception of large cell anaplastic carcinoma, immunotherapy with LMS or CP as given in this trial does not appear to be therapeutically advantageous in advanced lung cancer.",M2

The former 2 BMDMP populations expressed: (a) an increased level of acid phosphatase activity; (b) an increased degree of zymosan-induced chemiluminescence reaction; (c) a lower sensitivity of the proliferative capacity to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as compared to the BMDMP population from normal mice.

7073950,"Inhibition by the Landschütz ascites carcinoma of the granulomatous inflammatory response to C. parvum.I.p. or i.v. administration of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) to MF1 mice induces a generalized inflammatory response, associated with marked hepatosplenomegaly and accompanied by a pronounced granulomatous response in the liver. Injection of the Landschütz ascites carcinoma (LAC) 24 h after CP substantially reduced the intensity of the inflammatory response, and decreased both the frequency and size of the hepatic granulomas, as revealed by morphometric analysis of histological sections. The difference in cellular composition of the granulomas between the experimental groups, as revealed by light microscopy, was further emphasized and characterized by ultrastructural studies. These revealed the predominance of macrophages within the granulomas in tumour-bearing mice, in contrast to the predominance of epithelioid cells in the lesions which developed in mice given CP alone. Our experimental findings show that the inhibitory effect of the growing LAC on granuloma formation in response to CP cannot be ascribed to (a) sequestration of the microorganism within the growing tumour, (b) a nonspecific inflammatory stimulus, (c) diversion and seqestration of mononuclear phagocytes in the growing tumour or (d) the presence of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus in either the host or tumour cells. The inhibition of liver granuloma formation is consistent with an effect mediated by soluble, heat-stable tumour-associated factor(s).",M2

It is in this group of patients, with a high risk of recurrence from small residues of cancer left by the surgeon, that immunotherapy should have its optimum chance of success. A total of 92 patients were included in a randomized controlled study. The two groups were comparable in terms of tumour stage at presentation, operation performed and mean age of patients, but the control group had a preponderance of male patients.

7326194,"Lower relapse rates after neighbourhood injection of Corynebacterium parvum in operable cervix carcinoma.The effect of adjuvant immunotherapy with a single neighbourhood injection of 2 mg C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) was investigated in a randomized study involving 43 patients with carcinoma of the cervix uteri, all of whom were treated by radical surgery. All patients had carcinoma confined to the cervix, the upper part of the vagina or the parametrial region. When the malignancy had spread to the parametrial region, additional postoperative radiotherapy was given. 22 patients received immunotherapy 10 days before surgery, whereas the remaining 21 control patients received no immune stimulation. Only minor side effects of CP were encountered. Follow-up shows a relapse rate of 5% in the CP treated group and of 29% in the controls (P less than 0.05). A further 15 patients with more advanced malignancies were added to our studies. In these, CP stimulation had no effect on relapse rates, but the relapse-free intervals were longer after immune stimulation: control 3.5 months (mean) +/- 1.5 (s.d.), CP 13.0 months +/- 7.0 (P less than 0.05). The number of peripheral T cells and the ability to become sensitized to DNCB were increased after CP stimulation. A decrease was found in the number of blood monocytes and the number of monocytes capable of transforming into active macrophages, indicating a possible sequestration of these cells in the tissues.",M2
7326193,"Differential sensitivity of two murine leukaemia sublines to cytolysis by Corynebacterium parvum-activated macrophages.We observed the growth of 2 sublines of leukaemia L1210 in histocompatible DBA2 mice given 10(3) cells i.p. and studied the protective effect of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). The growth of subline L1210-M was unaffected by pretreatment with CP or admixture with 10(5) peritoneal cells (PC) from CP-treated mice. In contrast, the growth of subline L1210-C was inhibited; CP pretreatment increased the proportion of long-term survivors (70% vs 20%) and admixture with CP-PC prolonged the survival time (59 days vs 49 days; P less than 0.05). In vitro experiments indicated that Sublines M and C were equally sensitive to cytostasis by CP-PC, as measured in a terminal labelling assay (greater than 90% inhibition of proliferation). However, subline C was much more sensitive to cytolysis (18h 125IUDR-release assay) by CP-PC; percentage specific release from L1210-C was at least 90%, whilst from L1210-M it was generally less than 25%. The differential susceptibility of the 2 sublines to cytolytic PC was maintained through 75 passages in culture. The effector cells were considered to be macrophages, because they were adherent, phagocytic, and sensitive to silica. Cytolysis was unrelated to endotoxin contamination, because it was not inhibited by polymyxin B, and was inhibited by pre-incubating PC in culture medium for 24 or 48 h before adding target cells. Thus the relevance of nonspecific macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro to tumour resistance in vivo may depend on the strength of the cytotoxic reaction.",M2
6975256,"Combined chemotherapy--radiotherapy on spleen hypertrophy after C. parvum: combined treatment with 5-FU cyclophosphamide and radiation.C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) acts as a powerful stimulant for cell proliferation in the normal spleen. CP, in combination with radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, interfered with their effect to a lesser or greater degree depending upon the sequence in which CP and the cytotoxic therapy was applied. In these experiments, cyclophosphamide (CY), 5-FU and radiation were studied singly or in combination during the resting or after CP-stimulation, and the effects of the different combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy determined. Interestingly, CY acted both as a stimulant and suppressant for the spleen growth response when combined with CP. This may contribute to the reported effectiveness of the combination used for therapy in certain antigenic tumour systems. Radiation had a strongly suppressive effect on spleen response to CP in any sequence studied.",M2

The first effector cell was non-adherent to nylon wool and glass and non-phagocytic. These cells were selectively cytotoxic to the NK-sensitive target cell line K562, and present in the peritoneal cavity of mice 2 days after treatment with 700 micrograms of CP. The second cytotoxic effector cell was adherent to nylon wool and glass, and killed EL4 lymphoma cells derived from in vivo tumour transplants; these target cells are susceptible to phagocytic cell killing, but not NK-cell cytotoxicity in short-term (4h) assays. The adherent cytotoxic population of effector cells was present 4 days after inoculation of CP. In vivo studies showed that CP injected i.p. induced resistance to i.p. challenge with lymphoma EL4 cells, but no resistance was evident when the challenge dose was administered s.c. Adoptive-transfer studies showed that the effector cell type responsible for inhibiting tumour growth was nylon-wool adherent, probably CP-activated macrophages.",M2
7016302,"Surgical adjuvant therapy of malignant melanoma with corynebacterium parvum.The authors' previous surgical adjuvant trial in patients with malignant melanoma at high risk of recurrence has shown no difference in disease-free interval or survival between patients randomized to surgery + BCG or surgery alone. Reported here is a subsequent nonrandomized trial in 30 similar patients who received surgery + Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) 4 mg I.V. daily x 5, followed by 4 mg S.C. weekly for up to three years. After I.V. C. parvum, chills, fever, headache, and hypertension were common. After S.C. C. parvum, varying degrees of local induration, erythema, and pain were experienced. Dose reduction was necessary for 14 patients during I.V. treatment and for six patients during S.C. treatment. A marked decrease in absolute lymphocyte count and a decreased proliferative response of lymphocytes to common antigens in vitro was observed after 2-3 days of I.V. C. parvum. Lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens decreased, particularly with Con A. Marked increase in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes was seen in 20 patients. Although changes in delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to recall antigens followed no consistent pattern, reactivity to DNCB increased in 18 patients. In addition, median time to recurrence was 33 weeks, significantly shorter than in the previous trial, but the survival distribution was no different from before. It can be concluded, therefore, that the administration of C. parvum in this dose and schedule had essentially no effect on the outcome of these patients.",M2
7238649,"Augmentation of natural killer cell activity in spleens of infant, aged, and low responder strain mice by Corynebacterium parvum.Murine natural killer (NK) cell activity is both age- and strain-dependent.

Activity peaks at approximately 10 weeks, decreasing thereafter with mice over one year old showing significantly reduced levels. Mice showing low or no NK activity because of age (aged and infant mice, respectively) can be stimulated to show significant levels of NK lysis by i.p. injection of formalin killed Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>). In addition, CP treatment is also capable of increasing NK activity in mice from the normally low responding AKR strain. The NK activity induced or stimulated by CP appears to be like normal NK reactivity in that it is not decreased by removal of T-cells or adherent cells. Thus, in addition to increasing NK activity in normally responsive mice, CP is capable of augmenting NK activity in mice which normally show low or no levels of NK lysis.",M2
7471057,"Comparative effects of different strains of Corynebacterium parvum on natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Because there are conflicting reports regarding the effects of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) on natural killer (NK) cell activity, several different strains of CP were compared. In replicate experiments, age- and sex-matched mice received 0.25-mg i.p. injections of one of four types of CP; formalin-killed strain 6134; heat-killed strain 6134; formalin-killed strain 5888 (actually Corynebacterium granulosum); or formalin-killed CP from the Pasteur Institute. At various days thereafter, two to three mice from each group were sacrificed to determine spleen weight, cellularity, and NK cell activity versus YAC-1 lymphoma cells. The CP from the Pasteur Institute augmented NK cell activity 3 days following injections; however, the activity returned to normal by Day 7 and remained at that level. On the other hand, strain 5888 did not cause as great an increase in lytic activity as did the Pasteur Institute CP at Day 3; but by Day 10 after injection, NK cell levels were above control, and they remained elevated through Day 21. Both the heat-killed and formalin-killed preparations of strain 6134 stimulated NK cell activity initially but resulted in a loss of activity at the later times tested. Experiments done with different doses and routes of injection yielded similar results. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that different types of CP have different effects on NK cell activity in mice and that the general kinetics of these effects were independent of dose or route of administration.",M2

Both preparations were active against each tumor. In most comparisons the potency of the two materials was not different, but in a few cases the CP-BW was effective at a lower dose than was the CP-IM. These results demonstrate the versatility of C. parvum for use in a variety of immunotherapy procedures and show that the potencies of the two major types of C. parvum are very similar.",M2

Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) induced increased methyl-3H-thymidine (methyl-3H-TdR) incorporation in EC cultures, but the response was lower than that usually found with autologous or allogeneic normal human blood lymphocytes. Experiments with highly purified effusion lymphocytes indicated that the response to CP was influenced by the presence of adherent cells, probably macrophages. Normal human monocytes incubated in vitro with supernatants of unstimulated EC cultures expressed slightly increased ability to suppress methyl-3H-TdR-incorporation in a human tumour cell line. Supernatants of Cp-stimulated EC induced a further increase in monocyte-mediated cytostatic activity. Cell-free effusion fluid from 8 patients were largely inactive when tested for induction of monocyte-mediated cytostatic activity in the same system, and the effusion fluid reduced monocyte methyl-3H-TdR-incorporation in vitro. Thus, Cp seems to be able to induce DNA-synthesis and release of mononuclear phagocyte-activating lymphokines in human effusion lymphocytes.",M2
7446129,"Structure and function of human effusion macrophages from patients with malignant and benign disease. 2. In vitro cytostatic and cytolytic effect on human tumour cell lines.Human effusion macrophages isolated from the pleural or ascitic effusions of 14 patients with malignant or benign disease usually inhibited methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation in an adherent human tumour cell line (NHIK 3025) when the macrophages were challenged with target cells immediately after isolation. The cytostatic activity disappeared when the macrophages were cultured for 18 hours in vitro before target cell challenge. The presence of endotoxin (LPS) or Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) during the macrophage-target cell interaction induced a small enhancement of the macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity. Preincubation of macrophages with Cp or Cp-induced lymphokine supernatants for 2-18 hours before target cell challenge induced increased cytostatic activity in the macrophage cultures. Adherent (NHIK 3025) or non-adherent (K-562) human tumour cells prelabelled with methyl-3H-thymidine, when added to freshly isolated macrophages, were lysed in a slowly progressive manner. The cytolytic activity to K-562 cells was enhanced by increasing macrophage density in the cultures, and by incubating the macrophages for 2 hours with lymphokine supernatants before target cell challenge. Morphological observations indicated that K-562 cells adhered to macrophage membranes, with lysis proceeding extracellularily.",M2
6448615,"Immune-complex disease in mice and humans given C. parvum.The present studies in mice and cancer-bearing patients, treated with C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) immunotherapy, were to determine the effects of CP on the production of immune complexes (IC) and associated disease. Using the Clq-binding assay, circulating immune complexes were detected in mice given a single high dose of CP (466 microgram) and repeated human-equivalent doses (70 microgram). All mice treated with CP developed proliferative glomerulonephritis, the severity of which was dose-related. The histological and immunofluorescent patterns of the nephritis were those attributed to immune-complex disease. The mice had haematuria but were not in renal failure. Fifty patients with inoperable lung cancer were studied. All received radiotherapy. Twenty-two had no other treatment (controls) and 28 were treated with infusions of CP. Using 2 immune-complex assays (Clq binding and monoclonal rheumatoid-factor binding) IC were found in 10/22 control patients but these did not develop haematuria or proteinuria. Twenty-four of the 28 patients treated with CP developed transient haematuria and/or proteinuria with red-cell and hyaline casts, the changes resolving over 5 days. Immune complexes were detected in 5 of these 28 patients before CP treatment. Although 16/28 had IC at the time of haematuria and proteinuria, these findings were difficult to interpret because IC may occur in response to the tumour, the radiotherapy, or the CP. Although no patient developed renal failure, we believe that those treated with CP should have regular assessment of their renal function.",M2
6157543,"Human peripheral null lymphocytes. II. Producers of type-1 interferon upon stimulation with tumor cells, Herpes simplex virus and Corynebacterium parvum.Human blood lymphocytes, exposed for 6 to 24 h in vitro to tumor cells (K 562, IGR3, L1210), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) or Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>), produced high levels of anti-viral activity which was identified as type-1 interferon (IF). In mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures (MLTC), the generated type-1 IF was definitely shown to originate from the lymphocytes and not from the tumor cells. Supplementation of leukocyte cultures with 10% fetal calf serum instead 10% human AB serum had little influence on tumor cell-induced IF production, but strongly reduced CP-induced IF production. Lymphocyte fractionation procedures involving iron/plastic treatment, nylon wool columns, Ig-anti-Ig columns and rosette (E, EA) separation led to the identification of null cells as highly efficient producers of type-1 IF. T cells obtained by different ways (E-rosette sedimentation, passage through 1 nylon and 2 Ig-anti-Ig columns, or thoracic duct lymphocytes) were poor IF producers in response to tumor cells, HSV and CP, but secreted anti-viral activity when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. In MLTC, the level of generated type-1 IF roughly stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. In MLTC, the level of generated type-1 IF  roughly paralleled nautral killer (NK) cell activity. Evidence is presented that type-1 IF can be produced by an Fc receptor-negative null cell subset, whereas NK activity requires Fc receptor-positive cells. It is suggested that production of type-1 IF represents one of the earliest functions in the differentiation process of mononuclear phagocytes and is likely to develop before the appearance of Fc receptors, diffuse esterase staining and latex phagocytosis.",M2
7426303,"Effect of intravenous corynebacterium parvum on peripheral-blood effector cells of cancer patients.The i.v. administration of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) to patients who had recently undergone resection of colorectal tumours was found to have the following effects: 1. Polymorphonuclear leucocyte counts were raised 24 h after CP administration, while both lymphocyte and monocyte counts fell during this period. Polymorph and lymphocyte counts had returned to pre-infusion levels at one week, but monocyte counts were significantly increased at this time. 2. The lymphocyte mitotic response to PHA was reduced during the 24 h after CP infusion. 3 The spontaneous, antibody-induced, and PHA-induced lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against a nucleated target cell fell significantly 3 h after CP infusion, but these functions recovered by 7 days. 4. A rise in serum lysozyme was found 3 and 24 h after CP administration. However, these increased levels were not maintained beyond 24 h.",M2
7387830,"Single versus multiple human-equivalent doses of C. parvum in mice: neutralization of the anti-metastatic effect.The murine dose of i.v. C. parvum (466 microgram) was compared with a single, low, human-equivalent dose of 70 microgram and with repeated weekly low doses. All treatments increased the antibody titre against C. parvum (<e>CP</e>). However, repeated doses stimulated a much higher titre than single doses. In all treated animals spleen weight peaked at 2 weeks and then fell. A single low dose caused a 3-fold increase, a single high dose or multiple low doses a 6-fold increase. Liver weight changes followed a similar pattern. Hepatosplenomegaly was prolonged by multiple doses. The effects of these treatments on Lewis tumour metastases were studied. A single high dose and a single low dose on the day of tumour implantation (Day 0) were equally effective at inhibiting pulmonary metastases. Repeated low doses starting on Day 0 were no more effective than a single dose. The effect of CP on survival after primary-tumour excision on Day 10 was observed. Low dose CP on Day 7 doubled the harmonic mean of survival time. Repeated doses were no more effective than a single dose. Low-dose prophylaxis up to 2 weeks before tumour significantly inhibited metastases. However, when repeated low-dose prophylaxis was combined with a single low dose on Day 0, the anti-metastatic effect was abrogated. This neutralization of the anti-metastatic effect of CP given on Day 0 was found to persist after a 13-week treatment-free interval. Possible mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed.",M2
7362773,"Mechanisms of C. Parvum-induced coagulopathy in mice.I.v. injection of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) into C57BL and BALB/c mice caused profound coagulation changes, featuring thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, increased fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and a concomitant microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. These changes were greatest on the 9th day after CP, with recovery by Day 21. I.p. injection caused similar effects but s.c. injection was ineffective. Radiolabelled-platelet kinetics and distribution after i.v. CP indicated disseminated intravascular coagulation with rapid fibrinolysis; EACA treatment exacerbated the thrombosis. The coagulopathy correlated with hepatosplenomegaly, and both were dose dependent. Splenectomy did not effect the coagulopathy, but indomethacin totally abrogated the changes, suggesting that prostaglandin biosynthesis is involved in the pathogenesis.",M2
386712,"Direct effects of Corynebacterium parvum and BCG on human monocyte-mediated tumour cell cytostasis in vitro.Four strains of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) and BCG induced low levels of cytostatic ability to a human tumour cell line in human monocytes when added directly to conventional monocyte cultures. The cytostatic ability induced by mediators from autologous lymphocytes stimulated with the same agents was greater than that produced by direct addition to monocytes. BCG was more efficient in stimulating lymphocyte DNA-synthesis and lymphokine release than any of the Cp strains tested. In order to test the influence of contaminating adherent lymphocytes on the direct induction of cytostasis, monocyte cultures of greater than 99.9% purity were prepared by adherence purification. Cp induced low levels of cytostatic ability in such highly purified monocytes when added directly to the monocytes. Addition of BCG and Candida albicans had an adverse effect on the cytostatic ability of purified monocytes. A morphological study of Cp interaction with purified monocytes was performed. Cp, but not BCG, would seem to be able to induce low levels of cytostatic ability in human monocytes without lympohcyte cooperation. Human monocyte activation by the more effective lymphokine pathway is more efficiently triggered in vitro by BCG than by Cp.",M2

Peripheral blood T lymphocyte percentage, K cell activity, mitogen responsiveness, and monocyte and polymorph leucotaxis were measured at intervals over a period of 1 to 2 years. The only consistent difference between the CP-treatment patients and the controls was a slightly higher level of K cell activity in the former, who, however, fared rather worse than the controls in terms of survival.",M2
94306,"Studies of the producer cell of interferon in human lymphocyte cultures.The producer cells of interferon were studied in human leucocyte cultures stimulated by a variety of stimulants, including phytohemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). When the cells were fractionated by the use of neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells (SRBC), the T cell population responded with interferon production to PHA and PWM but not to CP or HSV. However, the non-T population showed a vigorous response to the latter two stimuli. In contrast, nylon column eluate cells enriched for T cells responded well to CP and HSV with production of interferon. To resolve these contradictory data, we have used combinations of techniques. Nylon column eluate cells were further separated by SRBC and it was found that the nylon non-adherent rosetting cell did not produce interferon in response to HSV or CP whereas the nylon-nonadherent non-rosetting cell did. In additional experiments more elaborate techniques were used. Leucocytes were treated by plastic adherence and iron filings, passed over a nylon column and subsequently over an Ig-anti-Ig column, and then rosetted with SRBC. Again only the non-rosetting population produced interferon. In parallel experiments the capacity of the different cell populations to lyse three types of target cells in a chromium release assay as a test for  natural killer  (NK) cell activity was investigated. There was some correlation between interferon production and NK cell activity. Thus, our data indicate that interferon is produced by non-T, non-B cells, possibly by cells related to NK cells.",M2
484237,"Activation of human monocytes by mediators from lymphocytes stimulated with Corynebacterium parvum.Human monocytes activated in vitro by lymphokine-containing supernatants of autologous or allogeneic lymphocytes stimulated in vitro by Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) expressed increased ability to suppress DNA-synthesis in a human tumour cell line. Monocyte activation was not dependent on in vitro differentiation of monocytes, enhanced cytostatic ability being observed at all stages of in vitro differentiation. The lymphokine-induced cytostatic ability was not affected by intensive washing and trypsin treatment of the activated monocytes, but disappeared during 48 hours of in vitro culture of the activated cells. The increased cytostatic ability of lymphokine-activated monocytes did not seem to be due to stable supernatant factors released from monocytes. CP stimulated DNA-synthesis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 28 normal donors, thus confirming the mitogenic effect of CP on human lymphocytes. Lymphokine production in response to CP correlated with the magnitude of DNA-synthesis, but appeared before DNA-synthesis could be detected in the lymphocytes.",M2
421172,"Further observations on the inhibition of tumor growth by C. parvum with cyclophosphamide. VII. Effect of treatment prior to primary tumor removal on the growth of distant tumor.The present investigations were directed toward determining whether primary tumor manipulation prior to its removal is advantageous for the control of metastases and survival. Studies were carried out to ascertain whether 1) there is justification for delaying surgical removal of a primary tumor to permit preoperative administration of cyclophosphamide (CY) and/or C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) and 2) there is an advantage to administering the immunotherapy directly into a primary tumor. After operation, in all investigations, systemic CP and CY was used. Despite the putative similarity of animals, tumors and treatment regimens there was marked variation in response of tumors to therapy. No benefit was derived from administering preoperative immunotherapy alone. When operation was delayed to employ systemic immuno-chemotherapy, a slight improvement in the control of distant tumor was noted. The employment of preoperative intratumor immunotherapy led to a greater prolongation of survival and more inhibition of distant tumor growth than did immediate primary tumor removal or the use of preoperative systemic immunotherapy. The results suggest that there may be an advantage to delaying removal of a primary tumor so that it may be employed in therapeutic strategies directed toward control of metastatic disease.",M2
547729,"Activation of pleural macrophages by intrapleural application of Corynebacterium parvum.A single ipl injection of 0.25 mg <e>CP</e> into CBA mice led to accumulation of macrophages in the pleural cavity, but it did not influence RES as an injection given iv ipl CP caused a three-to-five-fold increase in the number of nucleated cells in the pleural cavity which persisted at least 14 days. Of these cells 86% were macrophages as shown by their esterase activity. Less than 30% of cells from the pleural cavity of normal mice were esterase positive. Macrophages from the pleural cavity of CP-treated mice were capable of destroying in vitro cultures of a syngeneic mammary carcinoma, while normal pleural macrophages exerted no effect; the former were not cytotoxic for either syngeneic or allogeneic embryo fibroblasts. Ipl CP protected mice against iv injected mammary carcinoma cells; given to mice 7 days after iv inoculation of tumor cells it significantly reduced the number of tumor nodules in their lungs.",M2
728912,"Comparative effects of Corynebacterium parvum, Brucella abortus extract, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, glucan, levamisole, and tilorone with or without cyclophosphamide on tumor growth, macrophage production, and macrophage cytotoxicity in a murine mammary tumor model.In this laboratory, it has been repeatedly demonstrated (using a murine mammary tumor model) that the combination of cyclophosphamide (CY) and Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) is more effective than either agent alone in the control of tumor growth. This paper presents information obtained in our model comparing findings on the effects of CP with a Brucella abortus extract (Bru-Pel; BP) and glucan (GL) on tumor growth. In addition, the influence of those agents as well as bacillus Calmette-Guérin, tilorone, and levamisole on bone marrow macrophage colony production and cytotoxicity is presented. None of the nonspecific stimulating agents (NSSAs) inhibited tumor growth when administered systemically without CY, confirming our previous contention that such immunotherapy alone is likely to be an ineffectual form of treatment. Whereas tumor regression was observed following intratumor CP, neither GL nor BP had such an effect. When used with CY, neither BP nor GL administered ip or intratumorally inhibited tumor growth as effectively as did CP and CY. Inhibition of the growth of a distant tumor as well as the treated tumor occurred following intratumor CP and CY but not following intratumor BP and CY. All of the microbial NSSAs increased macrophage colony production to varying degrees in both normal and tumor-bearing mice. In the latter mice, CP had the most prolonged effect. Levamisole and tilorone failed to increase colony production in normal mice while in tumor-bearing mice the effect was inversely proportional to the amount of agent administered. To some extent, the stimulation of colony production by the NSSAs paralled the degree of tumor inhibition observed when those agents were combined with CY. The cytotoxicity of cultured macrophages could not be related to tumor growth inhibition.",M2
897175,"Combined radiotherapy and Corynebacterium parvum treatment of a murine fibrosarcoma.A single dose of Corynebacterium parvum (<e>Cp</e>) at 70 microgram, 175 microgram or 350 microgram was effective in suppressing the growth of a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma and occasionally in inducing complete regression and in prolonging the survival time of C3H/HeJ tumor-bearing mice. A single exposure of x rays at 2,000 rads induced some complete regression, but a higher number of complete regressions was induced by combined x-ray and Cp treatment. In the combined x-ray and Cp treatment, Cp given on the same day immediately after x irradiation was best. When 70 microgram of Cp was given a few days before x rays, the intravenous and intraperitoneal routes were better than the intratumor route of injection.",M2
863546,"An analysis of the factors allowing promotion (rather than inhibition) of tumour growth by Corynebacterium parvum.The following factors were found to determine whether C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) treatment promoted rather than inhibited the growth of methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma cells injected into CBA mice. (1) The dose of tumour cells. Promotion occurred only with low doses, around the TD50. (2) The route of injection of CP. Greater promotion was caused by intravenous (IV) than by subcutaneous (SC) administration. Addition of irradiated tumour cells to SC CP resulted in tumour inhibition. (3) The dose of CP. Promotion increased with increasing dose of either SC or IV CP. (4) The time of CP injection relative to tumour challenge. Promotion only occurred when CP was given before tumour cells, except when using IV CP and very few tumour cells. With increasing doses of tumour cells, first post-treatment with IV CP and then pre-treatment became inhibitory. The effect of CP on established immunity to tumour cells was also studied. Mice were immunized by tumour amputation. The resistance to tumour challenge thus generated could be abrogated by CP given before challenge, most effectively by a high dose IV. The data are interpreted according to the following hypothesis. (1) CP suppresses the expression of cell-mediated immunity to tumour antigens. (2) This is caused by trapping of anti-tumour effector cells at the site of CP deposition. (3) Promotion can only occur when CP is given before effector cells have reached the tumor site.",M2
323353,"Functional heterogeneity in macrophages activated by Corynebacterium parvum: characterization of subpopulations with different activities in promoting immune responses and suppressing tumor cell growth.Peritoneal cells (PEC) from mice injected i.p. with heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) showed enhanced immunostimulatory (accessor or A cell) activity as measured by their ability to restore the immune responsiveness of nonadherent spleen cells to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) and polymeric flagellin (POL) of Salmonella adelaide in vitro. This was true whether the PEC and nonadherent spleen cells were in direct contact or separated by a cell-impermeable membrane which allowed the free passage of soluble mediators. CP-activated PEC also exhibited greatly increased cytostatic activity against the growth of syngeneic tumor cells in vitro. After fractionation of the PEC according to cell size by velocity sedimentation, a separation of A cell activity from anti-tumor activity was observed. Although both these functions were associated with phagocytic cells of the monocyte-macrophage series, the highest A cell activity was found in fractions containing small and medium-sized macrophages, whereas the anti-tumor activity increased with cell size to a maximum with the largest macrophages. Thus, there is a relative increase of suppressive activity over stimulatory activity with an increase in cell size. Cytochemical and morphologic evidence suggests that the A cell-rich fractions contained small and medium-sized macrophages which were derived from newly arrived monocytes, whereas the large tumor-suppressive macrophages were relatively more differentiated.",M2
608517,"Increased sensitivity of C. parvum treated mice to ionizing whole body irradiation.We have investigated whether C. parvum (<e>CP</e>)-induced stimulation of hematopoiesis affects the survival of mice exposed to the whole body irradiation (WBI). C3Hf/Bu mice treated with CP exhibit an increased hematopoietic colony forming activity in their spleens and blood, but not in their bone marrow, as determined by the exogenous spleen colony assay. Also, CP-treated C3Hf/Bu as well as CBA mice show an increase in their endogenous colonies. This increased hematopoietic activity caused by CP treatment did not protect mice from the consequences of the WBI ranging from 650 to 950 rads. In fact, more mice died if they had been treated with CP. A decrease in the number of erythrocytes was more pronounced in mice treated with CP and irradiation than in those given irradiation alone.",M2
608515,"Effects of C. parvum on radiation response of murine tumors.The effects of intravenous C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) on the efficacy of fractionated gamma-irradiation in treating a fairly immunogenic fibrosarcoma (FSa) and a weakly immunogenic mammary carcinoma (MDAH-MCa-4) were studied in C3Hf/Bu mice. Tumors were 8 mm in diameter at the start of irradiation. The FSa was exposed to 500 and the MDAH-MCa-4 to 750 rads daily for 3.6 or 10 days. The administration of 0.25 mg CP varied from 4 days before to 14 days after the start of irradiation. CP greatly augmented radiocurability of FSa, especially when applied before irradiation. The effect was evidenced by the increase in the cure rate, and, in mice not cured, by the tumor growth retardation, reduction of pulmonary metastasis incidence and prolongation in survival of mice. This effect of i.v. CP on FSa radiocurability was not further increased by intralesional CP, or by systemic injections of vitamin A or the hypoxic tumor cell radiosensitizer Ro-07-0582. CP was less effective in augmenting radiation response of the MDAH-MCa-4. Here, CP slowed the growth of irradiated tumors and prolonged the survival of mice.",M2
608514,"In vivo transfer of antitumor activity by peritoneal exudate cells from mice treated with C. parvum.We have investigated whether peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from C. parvum (<e>CP</e>) treated (C3Hf/Bu mice could transfer in vivo the resistance against a syngeneic fibrosarcoma (FSa). Inhibition of tumour development and prolongation of survival of recipients were observed when CP-activated PEC were admixed with FSa cells before their intraperitoneal (ip) or subcutaneous (sc) injections into normal mice. The antitumour activity increased with the increase of the ratio of effector to target cells. Heat killed CP-PEC were unable to transfer the resistance. Also, pretreatment of recipients with 600 rads whole body irradiation (WBI) substantially reduced the efficacy of CP-PEC. Reconstitution of WBI mice with mixed normal spleen and lymph node cells, or spleen cells alone, or bone marrow cells did not restore the antitumor activity of transferred CP-PEC. In fact, reconstituted mice showed a further reduction of transferred antitumor resistance. CP-PEC activity was also inhibited in sc transfer experiments when normal PEC, spleen cells, T-cells or even fetal fibroblasts were admixed with tumor cells and CP-PEC. Possible reasons for the failure of WBI recipients to be fully protected by transferred CP-PEC are discussed.",M2
837334,"Intravenous Corynebacterium parvum: an adjunct to chemotherapy for resistant advanced ovarian cancer.This is a prelimianry report of an effort to treat women with advanced (Stage III and IV) ovarian cancer who had progressive disease in spite of previous surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation by a program of reductive surgery, intensive immune stimulation and combination chemotherapy. An initial laparotomy was done where possible to reduce tumor burden, and then all patients were given intravenous corynebacterium parvum (C.P.) in escalating doses over a 10- to 14-day period. Cyclic chemotherapy with Cytoxan, adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) was started and repeated monthly. Maintenance subcutaneous C.P. was given weekly. All patients had frequent follow-up clinical and laboratory examination. Immune function was measured by skin tests and in vitro tests prior to treatment and periodically during therapy. Two-thirds of the patients had depressed DNCB and PHA stimulation responses prior to treatment, and almost all had severely depressed lymphocyte counts. Thirty-nine patients entered the program. Exploratory laparotomy was done in 16 patients and in eight, successful tumor reduction was accomplished. Eleven patients received intravenous C. Parvum and all expired before receiving chemotherapy. Four patients received C. Parvum and less than three cycles of CAF; all expired within 2 months. Twenty-four patients received C. Parvum and less than or equal to three cycles of CAF. Four patients had complete regression of measurable disease and were living free of disease 9-12 months after starting CAF. Eight patients had more than 50% regression for a minimum of 3 months, and five were living with disease (LWD) 5-11 months. Five patients had 25% to 50% regression and three were LWD 4-8 months. Seven patients had no regression and all expired within 4 months. Of eight patients who had successful reductive surgery prior to treatment, three were free of disease, median of 10 months, and five had partial responses and were living with disease, a median of 9 months. Although pre-treatment immune function was better in the patients who had a good response to <e>CP</e> and CAF (10 of 12 were DNCB+) vs that in patients with a poor response (4 of 12 were DNCB+) immune function was not significantly improved during therapy.

1277181,"The effect of Corynebacterium parvum in combination with 5-fluorouracil, L-phenylalanine mustard, or methotrexate on the inhibition of tumor growth.Previous reports from this laboratory have demonstrated conclusively that cyclophosphamide administered asynchronously with Corynebacterium parvum (<e>CP</e>) results in greater C3H mammary tumor inhibition than that observed with either agent alone. An analysis of this combination has revelaed that the chemotherapeutic component contributes more significantly to tumor inhibition than does the immunotherapeutic one. This study was conducted to investigate the inhibition of C3H mammary tumors by other chemotherapeutic agents when used with CP. The results have demonstrated that 60 mg of cyclophosphamide per kg, 90 mg of 5-fluorouracil per kg, and 10 mg of L-phenylalanine mustard per kg administrated weekly have similar tumor-inhibiting properties. The addition of CP enhanced the tumor-inhibiting properties of each agent but to differing degrees. The effect of the immunopotentiator when used in combination with alkylating agents was greater than that seen when it was used with the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil. The tumor inhibition observed when cyclophosphamide was administered asynchronously with CP was significantly greater than that observed when L-phenylalanine mustard was similarly used. Of particular interest was the finding that the addition of CP to a combination of chemotherapeutic agents resulted in no greater tumor growth inhibition than that which occurred when CP was used along with the most effective single agent in the combination. The data have indicated that, contrary to clinical impression, there is no evidence that CP through its toxicity-sparing effect permits the utilization of larger doses of chemotherapy. Consideration has been given to the mechanisms that might account for the differences in tumor growth inhibition encountered when CP was used with different chemotherapeutic agents.",M2

Only CP exerted a suppressive effect on T-cell-mediated immunological phenomena (skin allograft survival; antibody production to tetanus toxoid; expulsion of adult T. spiralis worms from intestine). Results of experiments with congenitally athymic (nu/nu) mice and their heterozygous thymus-bearing (+/nu) littermates indicated that CP can induce macrophage activation in the absence of functional T-cells, whereas BCG-induced stimulation is a T-cell-dependent phenomenon.",M2
20335565,"Dental anomalies in individuals with cleft lip and/or palate.Significant heterogeneity has previously been reported but with no consensus on the prevalence of dental anomalies in subjects with a cleft lip and palate (CLP), thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of various dental anomalies in the upper dental arch in different cleft groups. Diagnostic records, i.e., panoramic, occlusal and periapical films, dental casts, and intra-oral photographs, of 122 subjects (mean age: 14 +/- 5 years; 67 males and 55 females) were grouped as either unilateral left cleft lip and palate (ULCLP), unilateral right cleft lip and palate (URCLP), bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), or cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Prevalence rates of 15 different dental anomalies were calculated for each group. Wilcoxon's test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the number of missing teeth between the right and left sides, in each cleft group. Overall, 96.7 percent of patients were found to have at least one dental anomaly. The most prevalent was agenesis in the anterior region on the cleft side (70.8-97.1 percent). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of agenesis by cleft and non-cleft sides but only in the ULCLP group (P &lt; 0.001). Significantly higher rates of impaction were observed in the anterior and premolar regions in the CLP groups (2.9-29.2 percent), with the highest rates in the anterior region on the cleft sides. A very high proportion of subjects were found to have at least one dental anomaly. Thus, the management of dental anomalies should be central to the treatment planning process of individuals with a cleft.",M3

METHOD: All mature infants with nonsyndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate (NSUCLP) born between 2004 and 2007 were included. Information concerning growth was collected. Weight and length at birth, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age measurements and data regarding feeding were obtained. RESULTS: Weight and length at birth, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age were identical with reference curve values. Children with NSUCLP showed a normal growth at two years. The weight curves lie between 5th and the 50th percentile for girls and between 10th and higher than the 97th percentile for boys. The height curves lie between -1 Standard Deviation and +1 Standard Deviation for girls and 0 and +2 Standard Deviation for boys.

20158415,"Pharyngoplasty after primary repair of clefts of the secondary palate.Our aim was to identify factors associated with the incidence of pharyngoplasty in patients with clefts of the secondary palate (<e>CP</e>). We studied 351 children born between 1968 and 1999 with CP alone, who had their primary operation at the Department of Plastic Surgery, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Data were collected retrospectively from the archives of the Oslo Cleft Team. During the study period 1968-2007, 68 children (19%) had a pharyngoplasty to improve their speech. Mean follow up time from the primary operation was 16 years (range 2-37). The estimated incidence of pharyngoplasty at 5, 7, 10, and 15 years after the primary operation was 9%, 12%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. Thirty-one (46%) of the pharyngoplasties were done more than seven years after the primary palatal repair. Children with total clefts of the secondary palate had a pharyngoplasty more often than children with clefts of the soft palate alone (7 years incidence: 11 (42%) compared with 22 (10%), p&lt;0.001). Sex, age at time of primary operation, and surgeon's experience were not significantly associated with the necessity for pharyngoplasty. Our study suggested that the necessity for pharyngoplasty is related to the severity of clefts, and duration of observation.",M3
20083809,"Asymmetry of the craniofacial skeleton in the parents of children with a cleft lip, with or without a cleft palate, or an isolated cleft palate.The objective of this study was to evaluate asymmetry of the parental craniofacial skeleton of subjects with a cleft lip, with or without cleft palate [CL(P)], and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). The postero-anterior (PA) cephalograms of 52 parents of children with CL(P) and 40 parents of children with CP from a sample of 196 children with non-syndromic clefts in the west of Scotland were analysed. A conventional cephalometric asymmetry analysis was used to evaluate size-related right:left asymmetry comprising eight linear distances, nine angular, and three facial area measurements. Right:left ratios of the mean values identified the direction of the asymmetry and two-sample t-tests determined statistical significance. A shape-related asymmetry analysis was also undertaken. The configurations of landmarks were optimally superimposed and scaled using Procrustes algorithms. Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) was then compared and the shape of the left and the right landmark configurations were statistically tested using a non-parametric bootstrap technique. For the parents of CL(P) children, size-related asymmetry was identified and the area of the craniofacial polygon was statistically significantly larger on the right than on the left side. EDMA detected the presence of shape-related asymmetry (T statistic = 1.304; P = 0.003). For the parents of CP children, although size-related asymmetry was identified, EDMA did not identify shape-related asymmetry (T statistic = 1.281; P = 0.065). Size and shape directional asymmetries are characteristic features of the parental craniofacial skeleton in CL(P). Although directional size asymmetry is present in the parental craniofacial skeleton in CP, shape asymmetry is not a characteristic feature.",M3

RESULTS: The mRNA expression of OPN increased since 2nd week of consolidation and reached the peak at 4th week (7.59 +/- 0.37). The mRNA expression of OC was up-regulated since 4th week, and reach the peak at 6th week (7.94 +/- 0.31). Then they decreased to about the level in sham group at 24th week (P &gt; 0.05). The OPN and OC were highly expressed during 4 to 6 weeks of consolidation. During 8 to 12 weeks, they decreased like their mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: The intramembraneous new bone formation after DO can reconstruct the bone defect of CP. The new formed bone can be remodeled to be quite normal bone tissue.",M3
20007998,"Prdm16 is required for normal palatogenesis in mice.Transcriptional cofactors are essential to the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily signaling and play critical and widespread roles during embryonic development, including craniofacial development. We describe the cleft secondary palate 1 (csp1) N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mouse model of non-syndromic cleft palate (NSCP) that is caused by an intronic Prdm16 splicing mutation. Prdm16 encodes a transcriptional cofactor that regulates TGFbeta signaling, and its expression pattern is consistent with a role in palate and craniofacial development. The cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) appears to be the result of micrognathia and failed palate shelf elevation due to physical obstruction by the tongue, resembling human Pierre Robin sequence (PRS)-like cleft secondary palate. PRDM16 should be considered a candidate for mutation in human clefting disorders, especially NSCP and PRS-like CP.",M3
20006274,"Urban-rural residence and the occurrence of cleft lip and cleft palate in Texas, 1999-2003.PURPOSE: The etiology of orofacial clefts is complex and relatively unknown. Variation in cleft lip with or without palate (CLP) and cleft palate alone (<e>CP</e>) was examined in Texas across urban-rural residence (1999 to 2003). METHODS: Cases came from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (1,949 CLP and 1,054 CP) and denominator data came from vital records (254 counties; 1,827,317 live births). Variation in maternal residence was measured using four classification schemes: Rural Urban Continuum Codes, Urban Influence Codes, percentage of county in cropland, and Rural Urban Commuting Areas. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios, adjusted for infant sex, plurality, gestational age, maternal parity, age, race/ethnicity, and education. RESULTS: Compared to the most urban referent category, living in more rural areas was associated with an increased adjusted risk of CLP. For example, the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes demonstrated elevated risks for CLP in  thinly populated areas  compared to  metropolitan-urban areas  (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.2-2.8); CP was not similarly associated. Percentage of county cropland was not consistently associated with any outcome. CONCLUSION: The association patterns between non-urban residence and risk of CLP, except for percentage of cropland, suggests a constellation of exposures that may differ across urban-rural residence.",M3
19937600,"Testing reported associations of genetic risk factors for oral clefts in a large Irish study population.BACKGROUND: Suggestive, but not conclusive, studies implicate many genetic variants in oral cleft etiology. We used a large, ethnically homogenous study population to test whether reported associations between nonsyndromic oral clefts and 12 genes (CLPTM1, CRISPLD2, FGFR2, GABRB3, GLI2, IRF6, PTCH1, RARA, RYK, SATB2, SUMO1, TGFA) could be confirmed. METHODS: Thirty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons, splice sites, and conserved non-coding regions were studied in 509 patients with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), 383 with cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>), 838 mothers and 719 fathers of patients with oral clefts, and 902 controls from Ireland. Case-control and family-based statistical tests were performed using isolated oral clefts for the main analyses. RESULTS: In case-control comparisons, the minor allele of PTCH1 A562A (rs2066836) was associated with reduced odds of CLP (odds ratios [OR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.64 for homozygotes), whereas the minor allele of PTCH1 L1315P (rs357564) was associated with increased odds of CLP (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.74 for heterozygotes; and OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.09-2.24 for homozygotes). The minor allele of one SUMO1 SNP, rs3769817 located in intron 2, was associated with increased odds of CP (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.99 for heterozygotes). Transmission disequilibrium was observed for the minor allele of TGFA V159V (rs2166975) which was over-transmitted to CP cases (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: For 10 of the 12 genes, this is the largest candidate gene study of nonsyndromic oral clefts to date. The findings provide further evidence that PTCH1, SUMO1, and TGFA contribute to nonsyndromic oral clefts.",M3
19929085,"Repaired cleft palate and ventilation tubes and their associations with cholesteatoma in children and adults.OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of ventilation tubes (VTs) on the formation of cholesteatoma and hearing in operated cleft palate patients with chronic ear problems. DESIGN: Retrospective 72-month follow-up of 116 operated cleft palate patients. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Demographic data, clinical examination, and hearing were evaluated. The patients were divided according to age and type of cleft and subdivided in a subgroup with (VT+) or without ventilation tube (VT-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The effect of ventilation tubes (VT) on the incidence of cholesteatoma formation and degree of hearing loss in operated cleft palate patients with chronic ear problems. RESULTS: The overall incidence of cholesteatoma was 15.5% (VT+, 14.0%; VT-, 16.7%; not significant). Bilateral hearing loss of &gt;20 dB remained in 14.0% of the VT+ patients and in 22.7% of the VT- patients (p &lt; .05). Submucous cleft palate (SM <e>CP</e>) adults (n = 15) developed high rates of cholesteatoma and hearing loss of &gt;20 dB (both 26.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Tube insertion had no influence on the development of cholesteatoma. Adults with submucous cleft palate especially require periodic otologic evaluation because they have Eustachian tube-related otologic disease and hearing loss at a higher rate than expected.",M3
19873719,"[Expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 and alkaline phosphatase in the reconstruction of cleft palate with distraction osteogenesis in rhesus]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the osteogenesis mechanism by analysis of the expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the reconstruction of cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) with distraction osteogenesis (DO) in rhesus. METHODS: The CP animal models were established surgically. 21 rhesus in experimental group underwent DO to close the soft and bony defect, followed by consolidations. Every 3 animals were killed and the specimen were taken out after consolidation of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 weeks. The mRNA of IGF-1 and ALP were detected with Real-time RT-PCR technique. The expression of IGF-1 and ALP was quantitatively analyzed by ELISA. The results were compared with those in control and sham groups (each of 2 animals), respectively. RESULTS: Since consolidation, the mRNA of IGF-1 and ALP increased significantly at one week and reached the peak at two weeks, but decrease to control level after 12 weeks of consolidation. The expression of IGF-1 also increased to peak level after two weeks of consolidation. The expression of ALT increased significantly since consolidation and reach the peak value after six weeks. They all decreased to nearly control level after 8-12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The palate cleft can be successfully closed with new formed bone after DO. The mechanism of bone consolidation is intramembranous bone formation.",M3
19860509,"Timeliness of primary cleft lip/palate surgery.OBJECTIVE: To examine the timeliness of primary cleft surgery, mean age at which surgery occurred, and factors associated with timely cleft surgery among children with orofacial clefts (OFCs). DESIGN: Retrospective study of children with OFC using North Carolina vital statistics, birth defects registry, and Medicaid files. PARTICIPANTS/PATIENTS: Medicaid-enrolled North Carolina resident children with OFC born from 1995 to 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of children who underwent primary cleft surgery within 18 months of life, mean age when surgery occurred, and factors associated with timely surgery. RESULTS: 406 children with OFC were continuously enrolled in Medicaid during the first 2 years of life. Overall, 78.1% of children had surgery within 18 months. About 90% of children with cleft lip (CL), 58.0% of children with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), and 89.6% of children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) received timely cleft surgery; the mean age at which surgery occurred was 5 months. Children whose mothers received maternity care coordination, received prenatal care at a local health department, or lived in the southeastern or northeastern region of the state were more likely to receive timely cleft surgery. CONCLUSION: Most children with OFC in North Carolina born during this time period received primary cleft surgery within 18 months of life, but this varied by maternal demographics and other factors.",M3
19779022,"FOXE1 association with both isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and isolated cleft palate.Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts are a common complex birth defect caused by genetic and environmental factors and/or their interactions. A previous genome-wide linkage scan discovered a novel locus for cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) at 9q22-q33. To identify the etiologic gene, we undertook an iterative and complementary fine mapping strategy using family-based CL/P samples from Colombia, USA and the Philippines. Candidate genes within 9q22-q33 were sequenced, revealing 32 new variants. Concurrently, 397 SNPs spanning the 9q22-q33 2-LOD-unit interval were tested for association. Significant SNP and haplotype association signals (P = 1.45E - 08) narrowed the interval to a 200 kb region containing: FOXE1, C9ORF156 and HEMGN. Association results were replicated in CL/P families of European descent and when all populations were combined the two most associated SNPs, rs3758249 (P = 5.01E - 13) and rs4460498 (P = 6.51E - 12), were located inside a 70 kb high linkage disequilibrium block containing FOXE1. Association signals for Caucasians and Asians clustered 5' and 3' of FOXE1, respectively. Isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) was also associated, indicating that FOXE1 plays a role in two phenotypes thought to be genetically distinct. Foxe1 expression was found in the epithelium undergoing fusion between the medial nasal and maxillary processes. Mutation screens of FOXE1 identified two family-specific missense mutations at highly conserved amino acids. These data indicate that FOXE1 is a major gene for CL/P and provides new insights for improved counseling and genetic interaction studies.",M3
19703238,"Periodontal disease progression in subjects with orofacial clefts over a 25-year follow-up period.AIMS: To assess rates of periodontal disease progression in subjects with cleft lip, alveolus and palate (CLAP) over a 25-year period without regular maintenance care in a specialist setting and to compare those with those of subjects without alveolar clefts, i.e. cleft lip (CL) or cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten subjects with CLAP and 10 subjects with CL/CP were examined in 1979, 1987, 1993 and 2004. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BoP) and plaque control record (PCR) scores were recorded in all 20 subjects. RESULTS: High plaque and BoP scores were recorded at all examinations in both groups. Over 25 years, a statistically significant loss of mean full-mouth CAL of 1.52 +/- 0.12 mm (SD) and 1.66 +/- 0.15 mm occurred in the CLAP and CL/CP group respectively (p&lt;0.05). A statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in mean full-mouth PPD of 0.35 +/- 0.12 mm was observed in the CL/CP group, whereas only a trend for a mean full-mouth increase in PPD of 0.09 +/- 0.11 mm was observed in the CLAP group. In subjects with CLAP, a statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in PPD of 0.92 +/- 1.13 mm at cleft sites was observed compared with that of 0.17 +/- 0.76 mm at control sites. With respect to CAL, the loss at the corresponding sites amounted to 2.71 +/- 1.46 and to 2.27 +/- 1.62 mm, respectively (p=0.36). CONCLUSIONS: When stringent and well-defined supportive periodontal therapy was not provided, subjects with orofacial clefts were at high risk for periodontal disease progression. Over 25 years, alveolar cleft sites tended to have more periodontal tissue destruction compared with control sites.",M3
19687392,"Otorrhea in infants with tympanostomy tubes before and after surgical repair of a cleft palate.OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of otorrhea in a group of infants with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) and tympanostomy tubes before and after surgical repair of the CP. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Otolaryngology clinic at a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-three infants with CP and middle ear effusions who underwent tympanostomy tube placement. Subjects were observed from the time of tube placement until 6 months after CP repair. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of otorrhea before and after CP repair. RESULTS: Subjects were observed a mean of 6.3 months before CP repair and 6 months after CP repair. Before CP repair, 11 of 33 infants (33%) had no episodes of otorrhea, compared with 22 of 33 (67%) after CP repair (P = .007). Fourteen infants (43%) had 2 or more episodes of otorrhea before CP repair compared with 2 (6%) after CP repair (P = .001). Before CP repair, significantly fewer tubes were patent at the time of the audiologic evaluation compared with after CP repair (39 of 62 [63%] vs 52 of 66 [79%]; P = .048). Average speech reception threshold for the infants with tympanostomy tubes before CP repair was 18.1 dB compared with 12.6 dB after CP repair (P = .01). CONCLUSION: The incidence of otorrhea after tympanostomy tube placement before CP repair is higher than the incidence after CP repair, although more than half of all infants (19 [58%]) had either 1 or no episodes of otorrhea before CP repair.",M3
19575106,"Cleft palate children: performance in auditory processing tests.Many children with auditory processing disorders have a high prevalence of otitis media, a middle ear alterations greatly prevalent in children with palatine and lip clefts. AIM: To check the performance of children with palate cleft alone (PC) in auditory processing tests. Prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty children (7 to 11 years) with <e>CP</e> were submitted to sound location tests (SL), memory for verbal sounds (MSSV) and non verbal sounds in sequence (MSSNV), Revised auditory fusion (AFT-R), Pediatric test of speech intelligibility/synthetic sentences (PSI/SSI), alternate disyllables (SSW) and digit dichotic (DD). The children performances in the tests were classified in bad and good. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between genders and ears. The average values obtained were 2.16, 2.42, 4.37, 60.50 ms; 40.71 to 67.33%; 96.25 to 99.38%; 73.55 to 73.88% and 58.38 to 65.47% respectively for the MSSNV, MSSV, LS, AFT-R, PSI/SSI tests with ipsilateral (PSI/SSIMCI) and contralateral (PSI/SSI/MCC) competitive message, DD and SSW tests.

The best performances happened in the sound location tests, verbal and non-verbal sounds for sequential memory and for PSI/SSIMCC tests.",M3
19523078,"Risk factors for oral clefts: a population-based case-control study in Shenyang, China.Shenyang in Northern China has one of the highest reported prevalence rates of oral clefts in the world. To explore the risk factors for oral clefts in Shenyang, we carried out a population-based case-control study. A total of 360 990 births in 2000 to 2007 were screened for oral clefts; the overall prevalence was 1.76 per 1000. The ratio of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL +/- P) : cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>) was 5.60:1. The overall male : female ratio was 2.02:1. CLP and CL were more common in males than in females with a sex ratio (SR) of 2.88:1 and 1.86:1 respectively, whereas CP was more common in females with an SR of 0.71:1. Using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model, 586 oral clefts cases were compared with 1172 control mothers. Maternal factors significantly associated with increased risk for oral clefts were history of a fever or cold (adjusted OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.06, 5.60); use of analgesic and antipyretic drugs (adjusted OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.41, 6.86); poor ventilation during heating (adjusted OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.10, 4.60); and consumption of pickled vegetables &gt;6 per week (adjusted OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.11, 13.47) during pregnancy. Factors which appeared to be protective were meat consumption &gt;or=4 times per week (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28, 0.67); and legume consumption &gt;6 times per week (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41, 0.89). Differences in risk were found between the two most common phenotypes, CL +/- P and CP only. Most of the environmental factors had stronger associations with risk for CL +/- P rather than CP, whereas history of oral clefts, as well as legume consumption, were more strongly associated with the risk for CP than for CL +/- P. The findings suggest that aetiological heterogeneity may exist between CL +/- P and CP.",M3
19521098,"Genome scan, fine-mapping, and candidate gene analysis of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate reveals phenotype-specific differences in linkage and association results.OBJECTIVES: Non-syndromic orofacial clefts, i.e. cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), are among the most common birth defects. The goal of this study was to identify genomic regions and genes for CL with or without CP (CL/P). METHODS: We performed linkage analyses of a 10 cM genome scan in 820 multiplex CL/P families (6,565 individuals). Significant linkage results were followed by association analyses of 1,476 SNPs in candidate genes and regions, utilizing a weighted false discovery rate (wFDR) approach to control for multiple testing and incorporate the genome scan results. RESULTS: Significant (multipoint HLOD &gt;or=3.2) or genome-wide-significant (HLOD &gt;or=4.02) linkage results were found for regions 1q32, 2p13, 3q27-28, 9q21, 12p11, 14q21-24 and 16q24. SNPs in IRF6 (1q32) and in or near FOXE1 (9q21) reached formal genome-wide wFDR-adjusted significance. Further, results were phenotype dependent in that the IRF6 region results were most significant for families in which affected individuals have CL alone, and the FOXE1 region results were most significant in families in which some or all of the affected individuals have CL with CP. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of careful phenotypic delineation in large samples of families for genetic analyses of complex, heterogeneous traits such as CL/P.",M3
19488469,"Oral clefts, consanguinity, parental tobacco and alcohol use: a case-control study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.This hospital-based, case-control study investigated the possible associations between family history of malformations, parental consanguinity, smoking and alcohol drinking and nonsyndromic orofacial cleft (OC, subdivided in 2 main groups: CL/P - cleft lip with or without cleft palate and <e>CP</e> - cleft palate alone). 274 cases were matched (age, sex and place of residence) to 548 controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) - adjusted for maternal age, schooling and smoking / alcohol use - were calculated by conditional logistic regression. The results demonstrated that the history of oral clefts either in the father's (CL/P: OR = 16.00, 5.64-69.23; CP: OR = 6.64, 1.48-33.75) or in the mother's family (CL/P: OR = 5.00, 2.31-10.99, CP: OR = 12.44, 1.33-294.87) was strongly associated with both types of clefts, but parental consanguinity was associated only with CL/P (OR = 3.8, 1.27-12.18). Prevalence of maternal smoking during the first trimester of pregnancy was higher among cases but the OR (1.13, 0.81-1.57) was not statistically significant. Maternal passive smoking (nonsmoking mothers) during pregnancy was associated with CL/P (1.39, 1.01-1.98) but not with CP. Maternal alcohol use during the 1st trimester increased odds for CL/P (OR = 2.08, 1.27-3.41) and CP (OR = 2.89, 1.25-8.30), and odds for OC tended to increase with dose. Neither smoking nor alcohol use by fathers increased risks for OC. This study provides further evidence of a possible role of maternal exposure to tobacco smoke and alcohol in the etiology of nonsyndromic oral clefts.",M3
19476092,"Cleft lip and palate: association with other congenital malformations.Orofacial clefts are frequently associated with other congenital malformations. Studies vary in incidence and types of anomalies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associated malformations in orofacial cleft patients at a major research hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Medical records of 1127 patients, in the Cleft Palate/Craniofacial Clinic, Boys Town National Research Hospital, from January 1980 through February 2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two categories: 1) cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>), and 2) cleft lip, with or without cleft palate (CL +/- P). Further categorization included location and type, if any, of other congenital malformations. RESULTS: 47.2% of patients had CP and 52.8% had CL +/- P. 32.2% of all cleft patients had associated congenital malformations. The orofacial region was the most common site, followed by cardiovascular central nervous, and skeletal systems. Congenital malformations were more common in CP (38.7%), than CL +/- P (26.4%). Of malformations diagnosed, 63.1% were chromosomal/syndromic anomalies while 36.9% were non-chromosomal/syndromic. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the spectrum of congenital malformations, associated with orofacial clefting, is essential for further diagnostic testing and in some cases genetic counseling.",M3
19467412,"Hoarseness in children with cleft palate.OBJECTIVE: Determine the rate of hoarseness in children with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Understand the relationship between velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and hoarseness in children with CP. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 185 patients with CP treated by a Children's Hospital Cleft Team and born between 1991 and 2001. RESULTS: Of total patients, 54.1 percent were male and 45.9 percent female. All types of CP were represented. The overall rate of hoarseness was 20.0 percent at age 3-4 and 18.4 percent at age 6-7. The presence of VPI did not correlate with the presence of hoarseness or dysphonia. VPI decreased when comparing age 3-4 (58.4%) with age 6-7 (30.2%, P &lt; 0.001), but the hoarseness rates did not change, 20.8 percent at age 3-4 and 19.5 percent at age 6-7 (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Patients with CP are thought to have increased risk of voice disturbances due to compensatory articulation mechanisms used when a patient has VPI. However, this study of 185 patients with CP showed no relationship between VPI and hoarseness. The overall rate of hoarseness of this population with CP was within the reported range for the normal population of children. These findings suggest that the theory that VPI causes hoarseness due to compensatory speech mechanisms may be incorrect.",M3
19441124,"Orofacial clefts in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997-2004.Orofacial clefts are among the most common types of birth defects, but their clinical presentation has not been well described in a geographically diverse US population. To describe the birth prevalence and phenotype of nonsyndromic clefts, we used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a multi-site, population-based, case-control study aimed at identifying genetic and environmental risk factors for birth defects. Included in the study were infants born during 1997-2004 with a cleft lip (CL), cleft lip with cleft palate (CLP), or cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Infants with clefts associated with recognized single-gene disorders, chromosome abnormalities, holoprosencephaly, or amniotic band sequence were excluded. A total of 3,344 infants with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts were identified, including 751 with CL, 1,399 with CLP, and 1,194 with CP, giving birth prevalence estimates of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.4/1,000 live births, respectively. Among infants with CLP where cleft laterality was specified, about twice as many had unilateral vs. bilateral involvement, while for CL there were over 10 times as many with unilateral versus bilateral involvement. Involvement was most often left-sided. About one-quarter of infants with CP had Pierre Robin sequence. Over 80% of infants had an isolated orofacial cleft. Among infants with CL or CLP, heart, limb, and other musculoskeletal defects were most commonly observed, while heart, limb, and central nervous system defects were most common among infants with CP. Better understanding of the birth prevalence and phenotype may help guide clinical care as well as contribute to an improved understanding of pathogenesis.",M3
19401770,"Genetic determinants of facial clefting: analysis of 357 candidate genes using two national cleft studies from Scandinavia.BACKGROUND: Facial clefts are common birth defects with a strong genetic component. To identify fetal genetic risk factors for clefting, 1536 SNPs in 357 candidate genes were genotyped in two population-based samples from Scandinavia (Norway: 562 case-parent and 592 control-parent triads; Denmark: 235 case-parent triads). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used two complementary statistical methods, TRIMM and HAPLIN, to look for associations across these two national samples. TRIMM tests for association in each gene by using multi-SNP genotypes from case-parent triads directly without the need to infer haplotypes. HAPLIN on the other hand estimates the full haplotype distribution over a set of SNPs and estimates relative risks associated with each haplotype. For isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (I-CL/P), TRIMM and HAPLIN both identified significant associations with IRF6 and ADH1C in both populations, but only HAPLIN found an association with FGF12. For isolated cleft palate (I-<e>CP</e>), TRIMM found associations with ALX3, MKX, and PDGFC in both populations, but only the association with PDGFC was identified by HAPLIN. In addition, HAPLIN identified an association with ETV5 that was not detected by TRIMM. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Strong associations with seven genes were replicated in the Scandinavian samples and our approach effectively replicated the strongest previously known association in clefting--with IRF6. Based on two national cleft cohorts of similar ancestry, two robust statistical methods and a large panel of SNPs in the most promising cleft candidate genes to date, this study identified a previously unknown association with clefting for ADH1C and provides additional candidates and analytic approaches to advance the field.",M3
19287188,"Expression analyses of human cleft palate tissue suggest a role for osteopontin and immune related factors in palatal development.Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is a common congenital malformation with a complex etiology which is not fully elucidated yet. Epidemiological studies point to different etiologies in the cleft lip and palate subgroups, isolated cleft lip (CL), isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) and combined cleft lip and palate (CLP). In order to understand the biological basis in these cleft lip and palate subgroups better we studied the expression profiles in human tissue from patients with CL/P. In each of the CL/P subgroups, samples were obtained from three patients and gene expression analysis was performed. Moreover, selected differentially expressed genes were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, and by immunohistochemical staining of craniofacial tissue from human embryos. Osteopontin (SPP1) and other immune related genes were significantly higher expressed in palate tissue from patients with CLP compared to CP and immunostaining in palatal shelves against SPP1, chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and serglycin (PRG1) in human embryonic craniofacial tissue were positive, supporting a role for these genes in palatal development. However, gene expression profiles are subject to variations during growth and therefore we recommend that future gene expression in CL/P studies should use tissue from the correct embryonic time and place if possible, to overcome the biases in the presented study.",M3
19211158,"Communicative abilities in toddlers and in early school age children with cleft palate.OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of improvement in communicative abilities in children with nonsyndromic cleft palate. METHODS: Longitudinal retrospective case history study. Out of 117 children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate born in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and enrolled in the cleft palate team of the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG), 63 children were included in the study; 29 (46%) boys and 34 (54%) girls. From these 63 Dutch speaking children communicative abilities were measured when toddlers and at early school age. Cleft types were cleft lip with or without cleft alveolus (CL+/-A; n=10, 5%), unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP; n=23, 37%), bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP; n=9, 14%) and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>; n=21, 33%). The percentage of problems in language comprehension, language production, articulation, hearing and hypernasality, present when toddlers, were compared with the percentage of problems found at early school age. The treatments executed were also analysed. RESULTS: Except for hearing problems, problems in all other communicative fields improved significantly. In the total group language comprehension problems decreased from 23% to 2% (p=0.00), language production problems from 21% to 6% (p=0.01), articulation problems from 57% to 25% (p=0.00) and hypernasality from 38% to 10% (p=0.04). Hearing problems appeared more difficult to treat effectively, they decreased from 42% to 31% (p=0.29). Children with BCLP appeared to have the most problems, followed by children with UCLP and then children with CP. Children with CL+/-A show the least problems. In the intervening period, often a combination of treatments was performed. Pharyngoplasty appeared to be very successful in treating hypernasality, with a success rate of 86%. CONCLUSIONS: At early school age, in children with clefts, speech and language problems were significantly improved following a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and resemble their peers without clefts. Hearing problems were more difficult to treat.",M3
19157891,"The 18q deletion syndrome and analysis of the critical region for orofacial cleft at 18q22.3.INTRODUCTION: The 18q deletion syndrome (18q-) is a multiple-anomaly disorder associated with mental retardation, white matter anomalies in the brain, growth hormone deficiency, congenital aural atresia, orofacial cleft (OFC), and palate abnormalities. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of different forms of OFC in 18q- individuals: cleft palate with or without cleft lip (<e>CP</e>/L), cleft lip (CL), and palate abnormalities. We also sought to map a potential critical region for OFC within chromosome 18q22.3 region. PATIENTS: The study presents an overview of selected 18q- individuals from 11 published reports and one presented poster. RESULTS: The frequency of CP/L and CL among 18q- individuals is about 25%; when high/arched palate cases are included, the frequency rises to about 43%. CONCLUSION: Orofacial abnormalities are characteristic features of 18q- syndrome patients and potential CP/L critical region could be assumed at 18q22.3 between markers D18S879 and D18S1141. In addition, gene deficient mouse models for Sall3 or Tshz1 genes, which are located at the 18q22.3 critical region, displayed palate abnormality phenotype.",M3
19067407,"Plasma zinc concentrations of mothers and the risk of oral clefts in their children in Utah.BACKGROUND: The role of maternal zinc nutrition in human oral clefts (OCs) is unclear. We measured plasma zinc concentrations (PZn) of case and control mothers to evaluate the associations between PZn and risk of OCs with and without other malformations. METHODS: Case mothers were ascertained by the Utah Birth Defects Network and control mothers were selected from Utah birth certificates by matching for child gender and delivery month and year. Maternal blood was collected &gt;1 year after the last pregnancy. PZn was available for 410 case mothers who were divided into four subgroups: isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P-I, n = 231), isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>-I, n = 74), CL/P with other malformations (CLP-M, n = 42), and CP with other malformations (CP-M, n = 63). PZn was available for 447 control mothers. The mean age of children at blood sampling was 3.7 years for all cases combined and 4.3 years for controls. RESULTS: Mean PZns of all groups were similar, and low PZn (&lt;11.0 micromol/L) was found in 59% of cases and 62% of controls. Risk of OCs did not vary significantly across PZn quartiles for the four subgroups individually and all OC groups combined. CONCLUSIONS: We previously reported that poor maternal zinc status was a risk factor for OCs in the Philippines, where OC prevalence is high and maternal PZn is low. In Utah, however, no such association was found, suggesting that poor maternal zinc status may become a risk factor only when zinc status is highly compromised.",M3
19041924,"Cleft palate caused by perfluorooctane sulfonate is caused mainly by extrinsic factors.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is found ubiquitously in the environment, and is known to cause developmental toxicity, including cleft plate (<e>CP</e>). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of CP associated with in utero exposure to PFOS in mice. We first examined whether the concentration of PFOS in fetal serum was related to susceptibility to CP. We compared palatogenesis following the administration of various concentrations of PFOS to dams. We conducted histological examination on gestational day (GD) 15 and 18, and alizarin red/alcian blue staining of fetal heads on GD18. Finally, we cultured palatal shelves (PSs) of GD14 fetuses, which had not yet made contact with each other, for 48h, to examine whether the shelves maintained the ability to fuse. The incidence of CP increased from 7.3% with a fetal serum concentration of PFOS of 110.7+/-13.4microg/ml (13mg/kg) to 78.3% with 138.6+/-0.9microg/ml (20mg/kg). PFOS at 50mg/kg on GD11-15 caused CP at a rate of 6.1%, meanwhile PFOS at 20mg/kg on GD1-17 caused a CP rate of 89.3%. Failure of palatal shelf elevation was observed with 20mg/kg PFOS. PFOS at 20mg/kg on GD1-17 and 50mg/kg on GD11-15 inhibited mandibular growth to the same extent, even though the rate of CP was different. Explants exposed to PFOS 20mg/kg and Tween 20 showed 94% (34/36) and 100% (31/31) fusion, respectively. We demonstrated that increasing the oral dose of PFOS from 13 to 20mg/kg resulted in a significant increase in CP even though there was only a small increase in serum concentration of PFOS. PFOS prevented elevation of the PSs above the tongue because their growth/fusion potential was maintained. Mandibular hypoplasia did not seem to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CP.",M3
18956930,"Transforming growth factor-alpha and nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without palate or cleft palate only in Kelantan, Malaysia.OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) Taq1 polymorphism in nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P) and cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>) in Kelantan, Malaysia. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Combined Cleft Clinic and at the Human Genome Centre in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia in Kelantan, Malaysia. DESIGN: We examined the C2/Taq1 variant of the TGFalpha gene in 46 patients with nonsyndromic CL+/-P or CP only and in 33 controls. The TGFalpha genotype frequencies in patients were compared with those in controls using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood. RESULTS: No association was found between TGFalphaTaq1 polymorphism and CL+/-P or CP in this case-control study. In addition, no homozygosity for the rare allele C2 was noted in CL+/-P, CP, or the controls. CONCLUSION: No evidence of TGFalphaTaq1 polymorphism was observed in association with CL+/-P and CP in this study.",M3
18956929,"Hospitalization, breast-milk feeding, and growth in infants with cleft palate and cleft lip and palate born in Denmark.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the duration of postpartum hospitalization, duration of breast-milk feeding, and growth during the first year of life in infants with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) are comparable to infants without facial clefts. DESIGN: Prospective data collection using a registration chart developed by the authors. SETTING: Special health care of infants with CLP/CP born in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All mature infants with CLP/CP born in 2003 and 2004 were included. Of 165 infants, 115 participated in the study. INTERVENTION: In Denmark, parents of children with CLP/CP receive counseling. This counseling is managed by specially trained health visitors/nurses and is initiated at birth. The counseling seeks to support parents' confidence in having an infant with CLP/CP and to initiate a relationship between the infant and the parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of postpartum hospitalization, duration of breast-milk feeding, and weight and length at birth, 5 months of age, and 12 months of age. RESULTS: Hospitalization was 4 days and comparable to that of infants without CLP/CP. The infants with CLP/CP received breast milk but for a shorter period compared with infants without CLP/CP. Weights at birth, 5 months of age, and 12 months of age were identical with Danish growth references. CONCLUSION: The authors find the results satisfactory and believe that the counseling provided by the health visitors/nurses plays a part in the results.",M3
18812870,"Anthropometry of the external ear in children with cleft lip and palate in comparison to age-matched controls.Comprehensive anthropometric measures in children with cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) have suggested that similar qualitative growth disturbances may be present in the auricle. We propose a study to evaluate and better understand auricular development in nonsyndromic children born with CL/CP. Our institution is a tertiary referral center for children with craniofacial anomalies. During a 4-year period, we randomly selected 50 nonsyndromic children, aged 5 to 18 years, with CL or CP. Fifty age-matched control children without craniofacial anomalies were selected as a control group. Anthropometric measurement analysis was conducted to compare auricular length (sa-sba), width (pra-pa), attachment to the cranium (obs-obi), and degree protrusion. Auricular index was also calculated for each group. Using a multivariate analysis of variance, statistical analysis with a P &lt; 0.001 demonstrates group differences when comparing ear length and ear protrusion in nonsyndromic children with CL/CP to age-matched controls. Ear length was greater in the control group, whereas ear protrusion (distance from the mastoid process to helical rim) was found to be decreased in the experimental group. Age and sex did not demonstrate significant differences in ear protrusion or length between the control and experimental groups. In nonsyndromic children with CL/CP, greater sensitivity should be given to the timing of auricular surgery. Comparisons of age-matched auricular measurements suggest that ear development may be altered in children with CL or CP. Further research is needed to investigate anthropological differences between nonsyndromic children with cleft and the normal population.",M3
18798320,"High prevalence of orofacial clefts in Shanxi Province in northern China, 2003-2004.Shanxi Province in northern China has been identified as an area with the highest prevalence of neural tube defects in the world; however, few reports exist on the prevalence of orofacial clefts (OFC). We examined the prevalence of OFC and their association with selected characteristics. Data came from a population-based birth defects surveillance system in four counties of Shanxi Province. The system captures information on all live births, stillbirths of at least 20 weeks gestation, and pregnancy terminations at any gestational age after prenatal diagnosis of a birth defect. Out of 25,355 births in 2003-2004, 83 cases with orofacial clefts were identified resulting in a birth prevalence of 3.27 per 1,000. Other major external birth defects were present in 12 (14.5%) OFC cases. Cleft lip with palate (CLP), cleft lip alone (CL) and cleft palate alone (<e>CP</e>) accounted for 62.0%, 29.6% and 8.4% of OFC cases without additional external defects, respectively. The male to female ratio was 1.04 (95%CI: 0.67-1.60) for all OFC, 1.46 (95%CI: 0.80-2.68) for CLP, 1.23 (95%CI: 0.52-2.91) for CL, 0.46 (95%CI: 0.08-2.51) for CP without additional major external defects, and 0.31(95%CI: 0.08-1.13) for OFC with additional external defects. The prevalence of OFC without additional external defects was increased with decreased maternal age (P &lt; 0.05) and increased maternal education (P &lt; 0.05). The birth prevalence of OFC in Shanxi Province of northern China is among the highest worldwide. Further studies are required to define the factors associated with excess risk of clefts.",M3
18788868,"Preferential associations between oral clefts and other major congenital anomalies.OBJECTIVES: To identify preferential associations between oral clefts (CL = cleft lip only, CLP = cleft lip with cleft palate, <e>CP</e> = cleft palate) and nonoral cleft anomalies, to interpret them on clinical grounds, and, based on the patterns of associated defects, to establish whether CL and CLP are different conditions. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Included were 1416 cleft cases (CL = 131, CLP = 565, CP = 720), among 8304 live- and stillborn infants with multiple congenital anomalies, from 6,559,028 births reported to the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research by 15 registries between 1994 and 2004. Rates of associated anomalies were established, and multinomial logistic regressions applied to identify significant associations. RESULTS: Positive associations with clefts were observed for only a few defects, among which anencephaly, encephaloceles, club feet, and ear anomalies were the most outstanding. Anomalies negatively associated with clefts included congenital heart defects, VATER complex (vertebral defects, imperforate anus, tracheoesophageal fistula, and radial and renal dysplasia), and spina bifida. CONCLUSION: The strong association between all types of clefts and anencephaly seems to be attributable to cases with disruptions; the association between CP and club feet seems to be attributable to conditions with fetal akinesia. Some negative associations may depend on methodologic factors, while others, such as clefts with VATER components or clefts with spina bifida, may depend on biological factors. The different patterns of defects associated with CL and CLP, indicating different underlying mechanisms, suggest that CL and CLP reflect more than just variable degrees of severity, and that distinct pathways might be involved.",M3
18616373,"Academic and clinical training in cleft palate for speech-language pathologists.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to obtain information about academic and clinical training of speech-language pathology students in cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: Representatives of 232 accredited graduate programs in speech-language pathology were invited via e-mail to complete a web-based 32-item questionnaire. Questions focused on the type and nature of courses offered related to CP, availability of clinical practica, and number of hours of clinical experience by students. An item-by-item analysis was conducted and descriptive statistics obtained. RESULTS: A total of 127 (54.7%) of the programs responded. Sixty-seven percent offered coursework exclusively devoted to CP, and for 53% of these it was a required course. For the programs that did not offer an exclusive course on CP, 35% indicated that CP was covered in other courses such as articulation, voice, or anatomy and physiology. Fifty-four percent of the programs offered clinical practica in CP. For these, a median of five students of a median graduate speech-language pathology class of 43 were enrolled in practica involving CP (range = 0-21), and students spent a median of 2 hours in practica involving CP (range = 0-100). CONCLUSIONS: Cleft palate is a complex disorder to which many students have limited exposure and for which more graduate training is unlikely since the 1993 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) certification changes. As a result, there is a need to look towards alternative methods to enhance the educational and clinical experiences of students and practitioners in cleft palate.",M3
18616362,"Folate and clefts of the lip and palate--a U.K.-based case-control study: Part II: Biochemical and genetic analysis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between nonsyndromic oral clefts and biochemical measures of folate status and the MTHFR C677T variant in the United Kingdom, where there has been no folic acid fortification program. METHOD: Dietary details were obtained from the mothers of 112 cases of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P), 78 cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>) cases, and 248 unaffected infants. Infant and parental MTHFR C677T genotype was determined. Red blood cell (RBC) and serum folate and homocysteine levels were assessed in 12-month postpartum blood samples from a subset of mothers. The data were analyzed by logistic and log-linear regression methods. RESULTS: There was an inverse association between CL+/-P and maternal MTHFR CT (odds ratio [OR] = 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.95) and TT (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.21-1.50) genotypes, with similar risk estimates for CP. There was no clear association with infant MTHFR genotype. Higher levels of maternal postpartum RBC and serum folate were associated with a lower risk for CL+/-P and an increased risk for CP. Higher levels of serum homocysteine were associated with a slightly increased risk for both CL+/-P and CP. CONCLUSION: While the inverse relation between the mother's having the MTHFR C677T variant and both CL+/-P and CP suggests perturbation of maternal folate metabolism is of etiological importance, contrasting relations between maternal postpartum levels of RBC and serum folate by type of cleft are difficult to explain.",M3
18616361,"Folate and clefts of the lip and palate--a U.K.-based case-control study: Part I: Dietary and supplemental folate.OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the associations between nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL-P) and cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>) and maternal intake of dietary folate and supplemental folic acid, in an area where the prevalence at birth of neural tube defects has been high and flour is not fortified with folic acid. METHODS: Interviews regarding periconceptional dietary intake and supplement use were completed with the mothers of 112 CL-P cases, 78 CP cases, and 248 unaffected infants. The data were analyzed by logistic regression methods. RESULTS: There was no overall association between CL-P and CP and either energy-adjusted total folate intake or supplemental folic acid use, irrespective of dosage. CONCLUSION: Overall, higher intakes of total folate do not appear to prevent oral clefts in this population.",M3
18587200,"Oral clefts: a retrospective study of prevalence and predisposal factors in the State of Mexico.The purpose of this study was to up-date the records concerning oral clefts (OCs) encountered at the Child Hospital of the Maternal Infantile Institute of the State of México, and to examine the association of predisposing factors. A retrospective study of the medical records of patients generated over a 5-year period was carried out. A total of 835 files were reviewed, representing 504 boys and 331 girls. The studied variables were the type of oral clefts and predisposing factors. Kendal correlations at P &lt; or = 0.05 and chi-squared at P &lt; or = 0.05 were used to find any associations between variables. The distribution of oral cleft was: cleft lip and palate (CLP) 70%, cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) 21%, cleft lip (CL) 8%, separate cleft lip and cleft palate 1%. The sex ratios were 1.7 for CLP, 1.7 for CL, and 1 for CP. Municipalities with ethnic groups as well as industrial, agricultural and pottery activities showed a high rate of prevalence. Although there was no significant association with birth weight, familial history of clefting, consanguinity, medication usage during pregnancy, or paternal occupational risk, the results suggested that the most severe clefts were proportionally related to these factors. A significant association with maternal and paternal age, abortion rate, and parity was found. Additionally, maternal agricultural activities suggested that pesticide exposure might be a factor.",M3
18536047,"Rethinking isolated cleft palate: evidence of occult lip defects in a subset of cases.Emerging research suggests that subepithelial defects of the upper lip musculature are part of the phenotypic spectrum of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) and may represent an occult, subclinical manifestation of the anomaly. The present study investigates whether similar occult lip defects are present in individuals affected with isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). To this end, upper lip ultrasounds of 33 CP cases (12 males, 21 females) were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of discontinuities (i.e., breaks) within the orbicularis oris muscle (OOM). In four CP cases (2 males, 2 females), distinct discontinuities of the OOM were identified. Of the remaining CP individuals, 23 demonstrated normal lip morphology on ultrasound (7 males, 16 females), while, in 6 cases (3 males, 3 females), a definitive evaluation was not possible. As CP and CL/P are traditionally thought to be etiologically distinct, these findings raise the possibility that some CP cases may be misclassified. Such diagnostic errors could have important implications for recurrence risk estimation and studies aimed at discovering etiology. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",M3
18481336,"Increasing accuracy of antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of cleft lip with or without cleft palate, in cases referred to the North Thames London Region.OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL +/- P) and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 256 surviving cases referred in 2002-2003 for treatment of CL +/- P. RESULTS: We had referrals from 36 maternity units, 27 of which were in our local catchment area. There were 154 cases of CL +/- P, of which five had microform CL. Of the remaining 149, 88 (59%) were diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound examination. Among these 88 cases there were minor reporting errors in 22 (25%). These errors were in describing the side and type of the lip cleft in 10 cases, predicting if there was a CP in 10 cases, and recognizing the anomaly in two cases. There were 102 cases referred with isolated CP, of which 92 had overt CP and 10 submucous CP. None of these was diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound imaging. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis between district hospitals and teaching/tertiary units. CONCLUSIONS: There is a good awareness and ability to detect CL +/- P by obstetric units from which referrals are received. Inaccuracies in antenatal ultrasound reports occur frequently when attempting to determine the type of CL and when predicting if there is a CP. We recommend that families should continue to be referred to specialist centers for counseling immediately after antenatal diagnosis, and comprehensive advice should always be given about clefts of the lip and palate.",M3
18381773,"Prenatal ultrasound detection of facial clefts: a prospective study of 49,314 deliveries in a non-selected population in Norway.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate prenatal detection of facial clefts by ultrasound examination in a large non-selected population, and to study trends in detection rates over 18 years, as well as the prevalence of isolated cases and those with associated anomalies. METHODS: This prospective follow-up study from January 1987 to December 2004 was divided into two 9-year periods. The study included all registered cases of prenatally or postnatally diagnosed facial clefts in a non-selected population in Norway. RESULTS: A total of 101 fetuses or newborns with facial clefts in a population of 49 314 deliveries were registered. The distribution of clefts was: 25 (25%) cleft lip, 52 (51%) cleft lip and palate, and 24 (24%) cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). No CP was detected prenatally. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL(P)) was detected prenatally in 35/77 (45%) cases, with a significant increase in the detection rate from 34% to 58% between the two 9-year periods (P = 0.03). Over the whole study period CL(P) was detected at a median of 19 + 2 gestational weeks, with no change over time; altogether 24/35 (69%) cases were detected at the routine second-trimester ultrasound examination. Thirty-three of 77 (43%) cases of CL(P) and 14/24 (58%) cases of CP had associated anomalies; 12/101 (12%) had chromosomal aberrations. In 18/101 (18%) the clefts were part of a syndrome or sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate for CL(P) improved significantly over time. Detection of CL(P) is important because nearly half the cases have associated anomalies.",M3
18325604,"Nasal mucus transportability in children with cleft palate.OBJECTIVES: Children with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) have a high prevalence of sinusitis. Considering that nasal mucus properties play a pivotal role in the upper airway defense mechanism, the aim of the study was to evaluate nasal mucus transportability and physical properties from children with CP. SETTING: Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo, Bauru, SP, Brazil and Laboratory of Experimental Air Pollution, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. METHODS: Nasal mucus samples were collected by nasal aspiration from children with CP and without CP (non-CP). Sneeze clearance (SC) was evaluated by the simulated sneeze machine. In vitro mucus transportability (MCT) by cilia was evaluated by the frog palate preparation. Mucus physical surface properties were assessed by measuring the contact angle (CA). Mucus rheology was determined by means of a magnetic rheometer, and the results were expressed as log G* (vectorial sum of viscosity and elasticity) and tan delta (relationship between viscosity and elasticity) measured at 1 and 100 rad/s. RESULTS: Mucus samples from children with CP had a higher SC than non-CP children (67+/-30 and 41+/-24 mm, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Mucus samples from children with CP had a lower CA (24+/-16 degrees and 35+/-11 degrees , p&lt;0.05) and a higher tan delta 100 (0.79+/-0.24 and 0.51+/-0.12, p&lt;0.05) than non-CP children. There were no significant differences in mucus MCT, log G* 1, tan delta 1 and log G* 100 obtained for CP and non-CP children. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal mucus physical properties from children with CP are associated with higher sneeze transportability. The high prevalence of sinusitis in children with CP cannot be explained by changes in mucus physical properties and transportability.",M3
18188776,"Speech results in adult Swedish patients born with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate.Sixty-one adult patients (34 men and 27 women) who were operated on for unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) were followed up from 1996-2001 by clinical investigation, perceptual speech analysis, and self-estimation of quality of speech. Thirty-four had had a von Langenbeck repair at the age of 8 months (L-8 group), and 27 a Wardill repair at the age of 18 months (W-18 group). Statistical comparisons were made by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. The L-8 group had a slightly better general outcome but at the expense of a greater incidence of velopharyngeal flaps. There was no significant difference in hypernasality, being 7/34 (21%) of the patients in the L-8 group, compared with 9/27 (33%) in the W-18 group. Compared with findings reported previously of patients with isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) who were treated and investigated under the same circumstances, the speech outcome in the group with UCLP was found to be significantly better.",M3
18181213,"Mouse genetic models of cleft lip with or without cleft palate.Nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP) is among the most common human birth defects. Transmission patterns suggest that the causes are  multifactorial  combinations of genetic and nongenetic factors, mostly distinct from those causing cleft secondary palate (<e>CP</e>). The major etiological factors are largely unknown, and the embryological mechanisms are not well understood. In contrast to CP or neural tube defects (NTD), CLP is uncommon in mouse mutants. Fourteen known mutants or strains express CLP, often as part of a severe syndrome, whereas nonsyndromic CLP is found in two conditional mutants and in two multifactorial models based on a hypomorphic variant with an epigenetic factor. This pattern suggests that human nonsyndromic CLP is likely caused by regulatory and hypomorphic gene variants, and may also involve epigenetics. The developmental pathogenic mechanism varies among mutants and includes deficiencies of growth of the medial, lateral or maxillary facial prominences, defects in the fusion process itself, and shifted midline position of the medial prominences. Several CLP mutants also have NTD, suggesting potential genetic overlap of the traits in humans. The mutants may reflect two interacting sets of genetic signaling pathways: Bmp4, Bmpr1a, Sp8, and Wnt9b may be in one set, and Tcfap2a and Sox11 may be in another. Combining the results of chromosomal linkage studies of unidentified human CLP genes with insights from the mouse models, the following previously unexamined genes are identified as strong candidate genes for causative roles in human nonsyndromic CLP: BMP4, BMPR1B, TFAP2A, SOX4, WNT9B, WNT3, and SP8.",M3
18060943,"Maternal corticosteroid use and orofacial clefts.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether maternal corticosteroid use during pregnancy is associated with delivering an infant with an orofacial cleft. STUDY DESIGN: This study included data on deliveries from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, which is a population-based case-control study. Exposures were assessed by telephone interviews for mothers of 1141 cases with cleft lip +/- cleft palate (CLP), 628 with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), and 4143 controls. RESULTS: Mothers of 33 infants with CLP (2.9%), mothers of 6 infants with CP (1.0%), and 72 control subjects (1.7%) reported corticosteroid use from 4 weeks before through 12 weeks after conception. The crude odds ratio for  any  vs  no  use was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.6) for CLP and 0.5 (0.2-1.3) for CP. When analyzed by route of administration and medication components, odds ratios for CLP tended to be elevated, and odds ratios for CP tended to be close to 1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a moderately increased risk of CLP among women who use corticosteroids during early pregnancy.",M3
18060257,"Prevalence of nonsyndromic oral clefts in a reference hospital in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, between 2000-2005.The aim of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of nonsyndromic oral clefts in children receiving treatment at the Center for the Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, José do Rosário Vellano University, Alfenas, MG, Brazil. All the data for the epidemiological study was retrieved from the files of 126 pediatric patients with oral clefts without any additional malformation, who came to the center for treatment between 2000 and 2005. A predominance of clefts was observed in Caucasians, and the ratio of male to female was 1.3. Males were 2.57 times more affected by cleft lip and palate (CLP) than females. CLP with a prevalence of 39.68% and isolated cleft lip (CL) with a prevalence of 38.09% were the most common anomalies, followed by isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>; 22.23%). Complete and unilateral CLP (26.19%) presented the highest prevalence, followed by incomplete and unilateral CL (23.81%). The present study presents the experience of a reference hospital in the state of Minas Gerais; however, the real prevalence of oral clefts in Brazil is still unknown. Our findings differ from those of a few previous Brazilian reports because they suggest similar prevalences of CLP and CL, and a higher prevalence of CLP in Caucasian males.",M3
17971350,"Implantation of tissue-engineered mucosal substitutes in the dog palate.Tissue shortage complicates the surgery of cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) anomalies. The healing of defects on the palate impairs growth of the dento-maxillary complex due to scar tissue formation. Implantation of grafts into the wound area might reduce this adverse effect of surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate a cultured autologous mucosal substitute, which can be used as a graft material. Two different types of cultured mucosal substitutes composed of skin-derived substrates (unprocessed dermis and AlloDerm) and autologous oral keratinocytes were implanted in palatal wounds in six beagle dogs (1-1.5 years of age). The cultured substitutes were compared with a sham and a control group. The animals were sacrificed in pairs 1, 3, and 12 weeks after surgery. Epithelial regeneration, inflammatory response (leucocyte protein L1), ingrowth of (myo-) fibroblasts, collagen type III, and formation of a basal membrane (JM 403) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that all cultured substitutes possessed a multilayered epithelium, closely resembling normal palatal epithelium. After implantation, however, the epithelium was lost and an inflammatory response was observed in the first week. After 3 and 12 weeks, the implanted substitutes had completely disappeared and epithelial migration occurred from the wound margins. It is possible to culture an autologous epithelium on a skin-derived substrate and implant it as an oral mucosal substitute in palatal wounds. However, these substitutes do not improve the healing of palatal wounds. It is suggested that the revascularization of the wound area is too slow to allow survival and integration of the substitutes.",M3
17868388,"TBX22 mutations are a frequent cause of non-syndromic cleft palate in the Thai population.Mutations in the TBX22 gene underlie an X-linked malformation syndrome with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) and ankyloglossia. Its mutations also result in non-syndromic CP in some populations. To investigate whether mutations in TBX22 play a part in the formation of non-syndromic CP in the Thai population, we performed mutation analysis covering all the coding regions of the TBX22 gene in 53 unrelated Thai patients with non-syndromic CP. We identified four potentially pathogenic mutations, 359G--&gt;A (R120Q), 452G--&gt;T (R151L), 1166C--&gt;A (P389Q), and 1252delG in four different patients. All mutations were not detected in at least 112 unaffected ethnic-matched control chromosomes and had never been previously reported. R120Q and R151L, found in two sporadic cases, were located in the DNA binding T-box domain. P389Q and 1252delG, found in two familial cases, were at the carboxy-terminal region, which has never been described. Our study indicates that TBX22 mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of Thai non-syndromic CP cases confirming its importance as a frequent cause of non-syndromic CP across different populations.",M3
17762986,"Dental arches in submucous cleft palate: comparison of six-year-old boys with unoperated submucous cleft palate, with operated cleft of the soft palate, and without a cleft.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dental arch dimensions in 6-year-old boys with unoperated submucous cleft palate (SMCP), and to compare their dental arch dimensions with those of boys without clefts and boys with clefts of the soft palate (<e>CP</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sizes of dental arches in 97 boys were compared retrospectively from dental casts taken at a mean age of 6.4 years (range 5.2-8.4). The material included 34 boys without clefts, 30 with unoperated SMCP, and 33 with CP. In children with CP, palatal closure had been done by the pushback technique at a mean age of 1.5 years. RESULTS: The dental arch dimensions of the boys with SMCP were similar to those of boys without clefts, except for a decreased maxillary arch length. There was no difference in maxillary arch length between the boys with SMCP and those with CP. The boys with CP had smaller maxillary and mandibular dental arch widths than the boys without clefts and with SMCP. There were no differences in the number of boys with permanent incisors between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Six-year-old boys with unoperated SMCP have similar dental arch dimensions as boys without clefts, except for a decreased maxillary arch length.",M3
17608554,"Distribution of orofacial clefts and frequent occurrence of an unusual cleft variant in the Rift Valley of Kenya.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pattern and distribution of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts among patients in the Rift Valley region of northwestern Kenya. METHODS: Subjects were categorized anatomically for occurrence of an atypical cleft lip variant (ACL), typical cleft lip (CL), cleft lip and palate (CLP), or cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), and family history of orofacial clefts. Tribal ethnicity data were obtained from both cleft and noncleft clinic attendees. RESULTS: There were 194 patients with CL (52.7%), 153 with CLP (41.6%), and 21 with CP (5.7%). CL constitutes a greater fraction of orofacial clefts in the Rift Valley region than reported elsewhere in Africa, principally due to frequent occurrence of ACL (52.5% of all CL). Among noncleft clinic attendees there was a lower fraction of Bantu and larger fraction of Nilotic-Paranilotic tribal ethnicity than in Kenya overall. In contrast, among patients with orofacial clefts there was significant underrepresentation of Bantu and overrepresentation of Nilotic-Paranilotic tribes, particularly Kalenjin. Patients of Kalenjin origin had a much higher rate of positive family history of orofacial clefts than Bantu patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is an unusual anatomic distribution of orofacial clefts in the Kenya Rift Valley, with frequent occurrence of an atypical CL variant. Our findings indicate that Bantu tribes have lower risk of orofacial clefts than Nilotic-Paranilotic tribes, possibly due to inherited genetic differences, perhaps accounting for the relatively low prevalence of orofacial clefts through much of Africa.",M3
17537400,"MMP gene polymorphisms as contributors for cleft lip/palate: association with MMP3 but not MMP1.OBJECTIVE: Orofacial clefts result from failures of developing embryonic facial and palatal processes to either completely merge or fuse. Normal development of the facial primordia requires remodelling of the extracellular matrix, which is mediated in part by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs can be considered a group of candidate proteins for the etiology of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) due to their role in craniofacial modelling. The purpose of this study was to determine if polymorphisms in MMP1 and MMP3 gene promoters were associated with CL/P. DESIGN: DNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells and genotypes were obtained from CL/P cases and controls through PCR with allele-specific primers (MMP3, n=333) and restriction-fragment length polymorphism techniques (MMP1, n=395). RESULTS: Significant differences between cases and controls were observed for MMP3 [5A/6A allele frequencies (p=0.00001) and genotype frequencies (p=0.00001)]; and between cleft types and controls (p=0.00001 for CL/P; p=0.04 for <e>CP</e>). No significant differences were found for MMP1 allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls or between cleft types and controls. CONCLUSIONS: An association between a polymorphism in MMP3 gene and CL/P has been observed. Although the extent to which this polymorphism may actually contribute to the affected cleft status is yet to be clarified, polymorphisms of MMP genes may be good candidates as genetic factors for their role in active ECM remodelling.",M3
17489001,"Assessment of arch constriction in patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate: a pilot study.The objective of this study was to test the use of the modified Huddart/Bodenham scoring system on patients with a bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) or an isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Study models of 5- and 10-year-old patients with BCLP (n = 19) and isolated CP (n = 55) from the Cleft Services in Scotland database were scored using the system by four examiners on two separate occasions to test inter- and intraexaminer reliability. The weighted kappa statistic was used to evaluate reliability. The interexaminer reliability ranged from 0.48 to 0.74 (moderate to good agreement) for the BCLP group and 0.77 to 0.86 (good to very good agreement) for the isolated CP group. The number of study models available for the BCLP group was small due to the low incidence of this cleft group, but the scoring system was shown to be reliable when used in cleft types other than unilateral cleft lip and palate. The modified Huddart/Bodenham scoring system provides a useful tool suitable for assessing arch constriction in all types of orofacial clefting, which is objective, sensitive, and versatile.",M3
17484178,"Physical characteristics of young men with cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, and cleft palate only.We report the weight, stature, body mass index (BMI), and muscular strength of men about 19 years old who have cleft lip, either with or without cleft palate (CLP), or cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>). Data were obtained from the Swedish National Service enrolment register for the years 1991 -97, and concerned 335 men with CLP and 88 with CP, who were compared with a control group of 272 879 men. The data showed that those with CLP and CP were significantly lighter than controls. Their stature in the CLP group was similar to that in controls, but those with CP significantly shorter. These findings imply that men with CLP had a significantly lower BMI whereas men with CP had a similar BMI compared with controls. Those with CLP did not differ as regards to muscular strength, but those with CP were significantly weaker than controls.",M3
17477747,"Sucking performance of babies with cleft conditions.OBJECTIVE: To describe the sucking performance of bottle-fed babies with cleft conditions. PARTICIPANTS: Forty 2-week-old-babies with cleft lip (CL; n = 8), cleft palate (<e>CP</e>; n = 22), and cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 10) were examined. METHODS: Suction, compression, and other sucking parameters were measured during bottle-feeding and compared to determine if they varied with cleft condition or feeding ability. RESULTS: All babies with CL and one with CLP demonstrated suction. Thirteen of 22 babies with CP demonstrated suction but only three maintained regular pressure changes over time. Between-group differences in the amplitude of suction and compression were associated with cleft condition. Cleft lip participants demonstrated the greatest amplitude of suction followed by those with CP and CLP. Cleft lip and CP participants generated similar amplitudes of compression. This was greater than their counterparts with CLP. Good feeders (n = 15) generated high levels of suction, while satisfactory (n = 15) and poor feeders (n = 10) did not generate any during bottle-feeding. CONCLUSION: Between-group differences in intra-oral pressures were confirmed when babies were examined by cleft condition. Babies with smaller clefts (i.e., CL or minor soft palate clefts) were more likely to generate normal levels of suction and compression compared to their counterparts with larger clefts. Since good feeders were more likely to have smaller clefts it was not surprising that they demonstrated higher suction pressures than babies with satisfactory or poor feeding ability. Compression values were not significantly different across the feeding ability groups. These data may inform feeding management strategies.",M3
17476195,"Analysis of family incidence of cleft lip and/or palate.BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze family incidence of clefts and to follow the relationship between the type of cleft in a child and in its parents as well as between the sex of the child and of the affected parent. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study comprised 540 children with cleft lip and/or palate with a positive family history of cleft. One hundred twenty-seven children were selected from this group whose mother or father had a cleft. In this group, the relationship between the type of cleft and the child's and affected parent's sex were analyzed. RESULTS: Two groups of genetic clefts were confirmed, each with different risks of repetition: group I with cleft lip and/or palate and group II with isolated cleft palate. It was demonstrated that the type of cleft in a child depends not only on the type of cleft observed in the parent, but that there is also a great risk of incidence of a cleft in sons of mothers with cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip and palate (CLP) or fathers with cleft lip (CL) and in daughters of mothers or fathers with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). CONCLUSIONS: 1. In 17% of children with cleft lip and/or palate, a positive family history was found. 2. The cleft type in a child depends not only on the type found in the mother or father, but also on the child's sex.",M3
17366853,"The middle ear of cleft palate patients in their early teens: a literature study and preliminary file study.OBJECTIVES: Middle ear disease is a frequent problem in young children with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Less is known about otological status in the adolescent CP population. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of current knowledge in the literature concerning the aetiology of middle ear disease in CP patients and the middle ear status of older children with CP, and to compare the situation in our centre to this background through an assessment of the otological status of patients in our CP population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted to summarise current knowledge about middle ear status in CP patients. A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical records of 20 CP patients between the ages of 10 and 15 who were treated and followed at the University Hospitals Leuven. The available otological data, otoscopic findings, information about hearing and surgery performed was collected for each patient when aged three and above ten years. RESULTS: Current knowledge indicates that middle ear function improves as CP patients get older. In our study, otoscopic appearance was acceptable in 63% of ears of children aged over ten years of age. Otitis media with effusion (OME) was far less frequent above this age than around the age of 3, with a decrease from 50% to 13% of all ears. Above the age of 10, tympanic perforations were present in 13% of ears and retraction of the tympanic membrane in 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a very high incidence of OME in young CP patients, the long-term otological prognosis is not necessarily sinister. A favourable natural evolution, diligent otological follow-up, early diagnosis and treatment of middle ear disease with the use of tympanostomy tubes are the likely contributors to the acceptable otological result in older CP patients.",M3
17349597,"Maxillary growth of adult patients with unoperated cleft: answers to the debates.Maxillary growth of adult patients with unoperated cleft has long been studied, but results varied between different studies. The objectives of this study were to determine the growth potential of adult patients with unoperated clefts compared to the normal population and to differentiate the growth potential among types of clefts. METHODS: Subjects were from the same ethnic group, were more than 16 years of age with non-syndromic cleft and no associated anomalies. The types of cleft included unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP), bilateral complete cleft lip and palate (BCLP), unilateral cleft lip (UCL) and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). The sella-nasion-A point (SNA) angle from the cephalometry was measured, and a dental cast study using a three-dimensional imaging system was performed. RESULTS: SNA measurements showed significant differences among different groups, the BCLP group having larger values and the CP group having smaller values when compared with normal values. Dental cast analysis measuring palatal surface area showed a significantly smaller area in patients with cleft as compared to normal controls, but no difference among the different types of cleft. From the linear measurement it was found that the interdental distance was significantly more narrow in the anterior part up to the first premolar region as compared to the control group, especially in the complete cleft groups (UCLP and BCLP). Dentoalveolar arch was also deeper and longer in these complete cleft groups. CONCLUSION: There is an intrinsic tissue deficiency in all groups of patients with cleft; however, the sagittal development is still comparable to that of a normal population. Tissue deficiency mostly occurs in the anterior part. There is no difference in terms of the deficiencies among the different groups of cleft.",M3
17326252,"MSX1 polymorphism associated with risk of oral cleft in Korea: evidence from case-parent trio and case-control studies.Orofacial clefts, including cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), are one of the most common congenital malformations in Asian populations, where the rate of incidence is higher than in European or other racial groups. A number of candidate genes have been identified for orofacial clefts, although no single candidate has been consistently identified in all studies. We performed case-parent trio and case- control studies on 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MSX1 gene using a sample of 52 CL/P and CP probands from Korea. In the case-control study, the allele frequencies of 6 MSX1 SNPs were compared between 52 oral cleft cases and 96 unmatched controls. For the case-parent trio study, single-marker and haplotype-based tests of transmission disequilibrium using allelic and genotypic tests revealed significant evidence of linkage in the presence of disequilibrium for 1170 G/A of exon 2. With the GG genotype as a reference group among GG, GA, and AA genotypes at 1170G/A, the disease risk decreased with the presence of the A allele (AA genotype: OR=0.26, 95% CI=0.10-0.99). These results are consistent with evidence from other studies in the US and Chile and confirm the importance of the MSX1 genotype in determining the risk of CL/P and CP in Koreans.",M3
17272867,"Few associations of candidate genes with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts in the population of Lithuania.Nonsyndromic orofacial clefting (NS-OFC) is a common complex multifactorial trait with a considerable genetic component and a number of candidate genes suggested by various approaches. Twenty biallelic and microsatellite DNA markers in the strong candidate loci TGFA, TGFB3, GABRB3, RARA, and BCL3 were analysed for allelic association with the NS-OFC phenotype in 112 nuclear families (proband + both parents) from Lithuania by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Associations were found between the TGFA gene marker rs2166975 and nonsyndromic cleft palate only (CPO) phenotype (p = 0.045, df 1) as well as between the D2S292 marker and the cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/<e>CP</e>) phenotype in allele-wise TDT (P = 0.005, df 9) and genotype-wise TDT (P = 0.021, df 24). A weak association (P = 0.085, df 3) of the BCL3 marker (BCL3 gene) with the risk of CPO was also found. Thus our initial results support the contribution of allelic variation in the TGFA locus to the aetiology of CL/CP in the population of Lithuania but they do not point to TGFA as a major causal gene. Different roles of the TGFA and BCL3 genes in the susceptibility to NS-OFC phenotypes are suggested.",M3
17219389,"Fetal and maternal MTHFR C677T genotype, maternal folate intake and the risk of nonsyndromic oral clefts.The association between maternal folate intake and risk of nonsyndromic oral clefts has been studied among many populations with conflicting results. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) plays a major role in folate metabolism, and several polymorphisms, including C677T, are common in European populations. Data from a French study (1998-2001) let us investigate the roles of maternal dietary folate intake and the MTHFR polymorphism and their interaction on the risk of cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>). We used both case-control (164 CL/P, 76 CP, 236 controls; 148, 59, 168 of whom, respectively, had an available genotype) and case-parent (143 CL/P and 56 CP families) study designs and distinguished the role of the child's genotype and maternally mediated effects on risks. This study observed a beneficial effect of mothers' dietary folate intake on their offspring's risk (odds ratio (OR)(&lt; or = 230 microg/day) = ref; for CL/P, OR([230-314 microg/day]) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9, OR(&gt;314 microg/day) = 0.64, 0.4-1.1; for CP, OR([230-314 microg/day]) = 1.15, 0.6-2.2, OR(&gt;314 microg/day) = 0.70, 0.3-1.4). We observed a reduced risk associated with the TT genotype of the child in the case-control analysis (OR(CC) = ref; for CL/P, OR(TT) = 0.54, 0.3-1.1; for CP, OR(TT) = 0.33, 0.1-1.0); this genotype, either fetal or maternal, was not statistically significant in the case-parent analysis. A frequency of TT genotype higher in our control group than previously reported in France can partly explain the risk reduction observed in case-control comparison. Interactions were not statistically significant. Stratified case-parent analysis showed, however, slight heterogeneity in the role of TT genotype according to folate intake. The modest sample size limits this study, which nonetheless provides new estimate of the possible impact of dietary folate intake and MTHFR polymorphism on oral clefts.",M3
17165598,"The lack of isolated palatal clefts in Czech Gypsies.Orofacial clefts are usually divided into three basic types: isolated cleft lip (CL), cleft lip and palate (CLP) and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). The incidence of specific cleft types in a population and their relative numbers show specific differences between ethnic groups and races. However, there are no available data about the incidence and relative numbers of orofacial cleft types (CL, CLP, CP) in the gypsy ethnic group. The aim of this study was to compare relative numbers of specific types of orofacial clefts between the Czech gypsy and non-gypsy populations. We conducted a retrospective epidemiological study using a set of all living patients with orofacial clefts born in the Czech Republic from 1964 until 2002. The cleft patients were subdivided into three groups: 5304 non-gypsy children, both parents of whom were non-gypsies (NN), 98 gypsy children, both parents of whom were gypsies (GG) and 18 children with one parent non-gypsy and one parent gypsy (NG). The relative number of isolated CP was 37.1% in NN children. However, the relative number of CP was significantly reduced to 5.1% (P &lt; 0.01) in the GG group. Conversely, the relative number of CLP was higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the GG group (62.2%) in comparison to the NN group (39.2%). The tendency to decrease in the relative number of CP and increase in the relative number of CLP was also apparent in the NG group, but not so well expressed. We hypothesize that the decrease in CP and increase in CLP and CL in gypsies might be caused by their genetic predis-position to CL. Since the CP originates later than CL during embryonic development, some CP arise in embryos with already existing CL giving rise to CLP. Consequently, the missing isolated CP might be hidden in the group of CLP patients postnatally.",M3
17211986,"Cell cycle proteins in normal and chemically induced abnormal secondary palate development: a review.Cell cycle progression and thus proper cell number is essential for normal development of organs and organisms. Craniofacial tissues including the secondary palate are vulnerable to disruption of cell cycle progression and proliferation by many chemicals including mycotoxin, secalonic acid D (SAD), glucocorticoids, retinoic acid and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin. Induction of cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) by SAD in mice occurs from a reduction in the size of developing palatal shelves. This is associated with an inhibition of proliferation of murine and human embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM and HEPM) cells as well as a G1/S block of cell cycle. In murine embryonic palates and HEPM cells, SAD inhibited G1/S-phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 activity, reduced the level of cyclin E and increased the level of the CDK2 inhibitor, p21. These results, together with those from other laboratories, suggest that common cell cycle protein targets (biomarkers), relevant to the pathogenesis of CP by multiple chemical exposures, that can form the basis for the diagnosis and the development of preventive strategies, are likely to exist.",M3
17133404,"Folic acid-containing supplement consumption during pregnancy and risk for oral clefts: a meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: There is equivocal evidence in the published literature that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy may protect against the common congenital anomalies cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) and cleft palate alone (<e>CP</e>). We undertook this meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that nonsyndromic oral cleft birth prevalences are different for those whose mothers took folic acid-containing supplements and for those whose mothers did not. METHODS: Human studies published in English were identified through MEDLINE, bibliography reviews, and contacting experts in the field. Within strata of prospective and case-control studies, CLP, CP, and all clefts, respectively, were analyzed using either a fixed or random effects model, as appropriate. We assessed for publication bias using Begg and Mazumdar's rank correlation and Egger's regression-based tests. RESULTS: Five prospective studies were analyzed, yielding combined relative risks of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.95) for CLP, 1.19 (95% CI: 0.43, 3.28) for CP, and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.95) for all clefts. Twelve case-control studies were assessed, which resulted in combined relative risks of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.90) for CLP, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.93) for CP, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.85) for all clefts. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our results support the hypothesis of a protective effect of folic acid-containing supplement intake during pregnancy on the risk for oral clefts, although this conclusion is tempered by the potential for bias and uncontrolled confounding.",M3
17152223,"Incidence of orofacial clefts in the Slovak Republic.Orofacial clefts (OC) are quite common congenital defects. Retrospective active survey collecting clinical data of children with OC examined and operated on in the three main specialized departments of plastic surgery in the Slovak Republic over 16 years (1985-2000) revealed total incidence of 1.61/10(3) live births (LB). 1,849 children suffering from OC were recognised out of 1,147,236 live births. Total incidence (TI) of OC per 1,000 live births was determined by types, gender, regions, districts and seasonal variation. The highest rate, 40.5% of clefts, affected the primary and secondary palate (CLP), more than 32% were of cleft palate type (<e>CP</e>), about 26% cleft lip (CL) and about 1% of associated malformations (AM). Clefts in males (1.71/10(3) LB) were significantly more common than in females (1.50/10(3) LB), sex ratio 1.14:1. Morbidity rates (TI) varies from 1.29/10(3) LB in the east Slovakia to the highest incidence of 1.93/10(3) LB in the middle Slovakia with wide range by district. Comparing data from the study and from the national register, 17% of children with OC were missed. Presented survey assessed risk of OC in Slovakia at the rate 1 newborn with OC per 620 LB compared with notified frequency of 1 OC per 745 LB.",M3
17097016,"Survey of the patients with cleft lip and palate in China who were funded for surgery by the Smile Train Program from 2000 to 2002.BACKGROUND: Cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) are two of the most frequent congenital malformations. Many epidemiologic studies on this deformity have been conducted worldwide, often producing inconsistent results. This study assessed epidemiology and some genetic aspects of cleft lip and palate in a Chinese sample from the Smile Train Program and to compare with other methodologically sound surveys. METHODS: The general information, family history, classification of cleft and associated malformations of 8000 CL and CP surgery patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 8000 cases, 7812 had complete data. The distribution of cleft types is 17.04% with CP, 23.39% with CL and 59.58% with cleft lip and palate (CLP). Unilateral clefts were more common than bilateral, with unilateral to bilateral ratios being 10.4:1 for CL, and 3.42:1 for CLP. The overall male:female ratio was 2.01:1. Left sided defects were more common than right sided regardless of sex, 1.90:1 for CL and 1.96:1 for CLP. CLP and CL were more common in males than in females with sex ratios (SR) of 2.88:1 and 1.85:1 respectively, whereas CP was more common in females with SR of 0.76:1. Associated malformations (2.89%), involved 29 CP cases, 41 CL and 156 CLP. The frequency of associated malformations in CLP (3.35%) was higher than CL (2.24%) and CP (2.22%) (P &lt; 0.05). Patients with CP or CLP were born less often in the winter than in the summer (P &lt; 0.05). A history of family members having clefts occurred in 6.84% of patients. The proportion of CLP cases (7.56%) was significantly higher than that of CL cases (5.64%) (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The different types of clefts appeared in the highest proportion in CLP and lowest proportion in CP. Males are more common with CL and CLP and less common with CP. These characteristics are the same as those of other Chinese surveys but different from some European reports.",M3
17113439,"Speech outcome after cranial-based pharyngeal flap in children born with total cleft, cleft palate, or primary velopharyngeal insufficiency.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a cranial-based pharyngeal flap on the speech of children born with a unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), or primary velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) without cleft. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 234 children born with clefts and 22 children born with primary VPI were evaluated. Children with associated abnormalities were excluded from this study. The Borel-Maisonny classification system was used to evaluate the velar insufficiency. The cranial-based pharyngeal flap was performed using the Sanvenero-Rosselli technique. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 2001, 74 children underwent pharyngeal flap for VPI. The mean follow-up period was 7 years. Borel-Maisonny scores after pharyngeal flap surgery were as follows: children with UCLP (n = 22), 59.1% type 1, 36.4% type 1/2, and 4.5% type 2; children with BCLP (n = 18), 44.4% type 1, 27.8% type 1/2, 16.7% type 2, and 11.1% type 2/3; children with CP (n = 17), 64.7% type 1, 23.5% type 1/2, and 11.8% type 2; children with primary VPI (n = 17), 29.4% type 1, 29.4% type 1/2, 29.4% type 2/3, and 11.8% type 3. There were significant differences in outcome among the 4 groups (P = .029; Fisher exact test). CONCLUSIONS: The positive effect on speech of a cranial-based pharyngeal flap is greater in children born with a UCLP or CP than in those born with a BCLP. In children born with primary VPI, this operation has only a slightly positive effect on speech that shows compensatory misarticulations; in such cases, alternative surgical choices or secondary procedures may be indicated. This information should be clearly conveyed to the parents in presurgical consultation so that they know what to expect from the procedure and postoperative adjuvant therapy.",M3
16953426,"Analysis of candidate genes on chromosome 2 in oral cleft case-parent trios from three populations.Isolated oral clefts, including cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), have a complex and heterogeneous etiology. Case-parent trios from three populations were used to study genes spanning chromosome 2, where single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers were analyzed individually and as haplotypes. Case-parent trios from three populations (74 from Maryland, 64 from Singapore and 95 from Taiwan) were genotyped for 962 SNPs in 104 genes on chromosome 2, including two well-recognized candidate genes: TGFA and SATB2. Individual SNPs and haplotypes (in sliding windows of 2-5 SNPs) were used to test for linkage and disequilibrium separately in CL/P and CP trios. A novel candidate gene (ZNF533) showed consistent evidence of linkage and disequilibrium in all three populations for both CL/P and CP. SNPs in key regions of ZNF533 showed considerable variability in estimated genotypic odds ratios and their significance, suggesting allelic heterogeneity. Haplotype frequencies for regions of ZNF533 were estimated and used to partition genetic variance into among-and within-population components. Wright's fixation index, a measure of genetic diversity, showed little difference between Singapore and Taiwan compared with Maryland. The tensin-1 gene (TNS1) also showed evidence of linkage and disequilibrium among both CL/P and CP trios in all three populations, albeit at a lower level of significance. Additional genes (VAX2, GLI2, ZHFX1B on 2p; WNT6-WNT10A and COL4A3-COL4A4 on 2q) showed consistent evidence of linkage and disequilibrium only among CL/P trios in all three populations, and TGFA showed significant evidence in two of three populations.",M3
17071392,"Videoendoscopic, speech and hearing in cleft palate children after levator-palatopharyngeus surgery according to Kriens.INTRODUCTION: The importance of the soft palate is greater than its dimension. Velopharyngeal muscles have diverse functions. The goal of this study was to clarify the efficacy of levator-palatopharyngeus surgery according to Kriens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective follow-up of 22 cleft patients operated at the Department of Oral and Maxillo-Facial and Plastic Surgery at the University of Greifswald between 1994 to 2001, within the context of primary closure of the palate. A questionnaire evaluated parents' opinion of postoperative results of treatment. Speech, videoendoscopics and hearing findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Parents assessed success of the treatment as adequate to very good. More than a half of the patients had perfect or very usable colloquial speech. Speech findings of patients with palatal clefts (<e>CP</e>) were significantly better than those of patients with clefts of lip, alveolus and palate (CLAP) (p = 0.043). Velopharyngeal closure pattern with highest prevalence was the coronal closure type. Subjects with CLAP were much more likely to have poor velopharyngeal closure (VPI &gt; 2 mm(2); 58%) than those with a CP (12%). More than 75% of the patients showed normal hearing results in the audiogram. CONCLUSION: Levator-palatopharyngeus surgery according to Kriens seems to be effective in exact reconstruction of velar muscle sling, improving velopharyngeal structure and function.",M3
16937594,"Nasal airway dimensions of adults with cleft lip and palate: differences among cleft types.OBJECTIVE: To determine the nasal airway dimensions in adults with repaired cleft lip and palate by rhinomanometry and to analyze the reduction associated with different types of clefts. MODEL: A prospective analysis comparing three types of previously repaired clefts: bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), and isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) at the 5% level of significance. SETTING: Laboratory of Physiology, Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of São Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-three subjects aged 18 to 35 years (17 BCLP, 16 UCLP, 20 CP) and a group of 20 individuals without cleft (N). VARIABLES: Minimum cross-sectional nasal area assessed by posterior (PR) and anterior (AR) rhinomanometry and nasopharyngeal area assessed by modified AR. RESULTS: Mean (+/- 1 SD) nasal areas obtained by PR were: 0.47 +/- 0.16 cm(2) (BCLP), 0.57 +/- 0.19 cm(2) (UCLP), 0.61 +/- 0.13 cm(2) (CP), and 0.60 +/- 0.10 cm(2) (N). The mean value for the BCLP group was significantly smaller than that for the N and CP groups. The remaining values did not differ from one another. The proportion of subjects with subnormal areas obtained by PR was 41%, 19%, and 0% for groups BCLP, UCLP, and CP, respectively. Similar results were obtained by AR. All subjects presented a nasopharyngeal area larger than 0.80 cm(2), denoting absence of obstruction in the nasopharynx. CONCLUSIONS: In adulthood BCLP is the type of cleft associated with a greater reduction of nasal airway, compared with UCLP and CP, suggesting that adults with BCLP are at a greater risk for nasal obstruction.",M3

Reducing risk of recurrence--a 25-year clinical experience]From 1980 to 2005, 71 female patients having non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP) or cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) themselves or in their family and desiring to have children underwent 88 times a cleft prevention protocol with high doses of Vitamin B Complex and Actovegin twice a week. The data about the outcome of the pregnancy were prospectively collected. Empiric data of the recurrence risks from the literature depending on the cleft type were used as comparative group. In 80 cases, a healthy child was born. In two cases microsymptoms of unilateral lip notches were observed. The observed risks with prophylaxis were 2.9% (only microsymptoms!) and 0% comparing with 4.9% and 2.4% respectively in the controls. The relative risk as reference value between expected and observed risk was 0.6 (microsymptoms) for CLP and 0 for CP.",M3
16846134,"[Reconstruction of velopharyngeal sphincter in secondary Cleft Palate: surgical alternative]There are numerous surgical procedures for the repair of Cleft Palate (<e>CP</e>). Since 1998, in children with CP we use a modified Wardill-Kilner technique, with a large section of the nasal mucous layer at the level of the muscular insertion on the hard palate and lateral nasopharingeal wall, obtaining a push-back and reorientation of the muscular fibres without dissection, diminishing this way the risks of haemorrhages and fibrosis, simplifying the intervention. It allows a lower operative time and a short internment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of this operative procedure specially in the development of the speech in 73 children operated on from 1998 until 2000 in our hospital. We verify a competence of the velopharingeal sphincter with ideal results in speech in 88,8% of the cases.",M3

The objective of our study is to describe the most common genetic syndromes and associated anomalies in patients with CL/<e>CP</e> in Latvia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study material was medical records obtained from Riga Cleft Lip and Palate Centre Registry in a time period of 1980 till 2005. There was analyzed information about patients with identified genetic syndromes and associated anomalies. RESULTS: In a time period from 1980 till 2005, the following genetic syndromes were identified: Van der Woude, Fetal alcohol syndrome, Holzgreve syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Myotonic dystrophy, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Patau syndrome, Potter sequence and Pierre Robin sequence. 16% of CL/CP patients have recognized genetic syndromes or associated anomalies, including profound, severe and moderate mental retardation. Number is lower than expected, but still correlates with date presented in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: Long term follow-up of multidisciplinary specialists which includes cardiologists, clinical-geneticists and paediatricians, is needed for CL/CP patients with associated anomalies in order to identify timely side diseases and complications.

16690250,"A new approach to repairing cleft palate and acquired palatal defects with distraction osteogenesis.Cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) is one of the most common human congenital deformities, and acquired palate defects after trauma or tumour resection are also common. In this study, distraction osteogenesis (DO) for CP and other palatal bone defects was evaluated. Twenty cats were assigned randomly to 3 groups of (1) 15, (2) 3 and (3) 2 cats. In groups 1 and 2, a rectangular ostectomy, in the posterior of the palatal bone shelf, was performed in the sagittal axis to establish the CP defect model. At the same time, a pure titanium intraoral distractor was fixed to molar teeth with brackets and to the palatal bone shelf across the defect with titanium miniscrews bilaterally. Four weeks later, a secondary transport disc (TD) osteotomy was performed, and gradual DO treatment started at 0.4mm twice a day, after 6 days of latency. DO was performed until the TD reached the opposite margin over the gap in 5-6 days. Three cats each of group 1 were killed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after completion of DO. In group 2, the bone and soft-tissue defects were untreated until death 6 weeks later. Group 3 cats (control) were killed after 6 weeks. The TD successfully recombined with the opposite palatal bone stump, and proportional expansion of the overlay mucoperiosteal flap was achieved. Intramembranous bone formation was revealed: parallel collagen bundles gradually deposited on new bone trabeculae while the proliferative osteoblasts produced bone matrix. The bone defect was finally reconstructed by de novo osteogenesis. The control group was observed to have no spontaneous repairing. These results suggest that the CP defect was reconstructed by osteogenesis in situ, and the soft tissues expanded simultaneously to achieve functional correction. The intraoral distractor provided both effective distraction and stability.",M3
16777429,"Nasolabial symmetry following Tennison-Randall lip repair: a three-dimensional approach in 10-year-old patients with unilateral clefts of lip, alveolus and palate.AIM: To assess the degree of facial symmetry in patients suffering from unilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate (UCLAP) by determining differences between the cleft and the non-cleft hemifaces from 3D surface data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In twenty-two 10-year-old UCLAP patients, who had the lip repaired using the Tennison-Randall technique and did not undergo further revisional surgery, differences were determined between landmarks, surface areas of the upper lip vermilion and nostrils and virtual volumes of midface, nose and upper lip for cleft and non-cleft sides, separately, after having established a plane of symmetry calculated from optical 3D facial surface data. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences could be found between cleft and non-cleft sides for the nasal landmarks G(lat), G(sup) and La(med), the nostril angle and the virtual volume of the nose (p(Glat)=0.011, p(Gsup)&lt;0.0005, p(Lamed)=0.002, p(nostril angle)=0.036 and p(nose volume)&lt;0.0005, resp.). CONCLUSION: Analysis of 3D data shows that complete nasal symmetry is difficult to achieve with Tennison-Randall's lip repair without revisional surgery. Further trials on larger populations of patients will allow a more comprehensive and consistent analysis of the consequence of different methods for <e>cp</e> repair in order to identify the techniques with the best outcome in terms of facial symmetry.",M3

METHODS: A review of the literature has been conducted using MedLine sources dated 1970-2005. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal has been searched manually. The reference lists of all previous publications were consulted to identify any publications, not already identified using the electronic search. RESULTS: 21 similar cephalometric studies investigating the parental craniofacial morphology in orofacial clefts were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The craniofacial morphology of the parents of children with cleft lip and/or palate CL(P) is different in comparison to the non- cleft population. There is a lack of consistency in study designs and results to accurately characterize the parents of children with CL(P). The craniofacial morphology of the parents of children with CL(P) differs from the parents of children with isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), there is insufficient information to precisely localize these differences.",M3
16687911,"Mutation analysis of the MSX1 gene exons and intron in patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.Cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate (CL/CLP/<e>CP</e>) is one of the most common malformations among newborns. The estimated prevalence in Latvia is 1/700. Nonsyndromic CL/CLP/CP is a complex trait determined by multiple, interacting genetic and environmental factors. MSX1 gene is one of the most important candidate-genes, which had been analyzed in relation with nonsyndromic CL/CLP/CP. The objective of our study was to examine the etiologic role of MSX1 gene mutations in the development of nonsyndromic CL/CLP/CP in Latvian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from venous blood of 53 patients with cleft lip with or without palate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed of selected segments of MSX1 gene. These were sequenced and analysed by comparison with reference sequence, accession Nr. AF426432 (NCBI). RESULTS: 16 DNA sequence variations were identified in 53 patient samples; 6 of them have not been previously described. Identified sequence variations localized in coding regions do not cause amino acid substitutions, therefore they are not considered as mutations with an etiological role in CL/CLP/CP development.

On the basis of history, regular otorhinolaryngological examinations and hearing tests, the prevalence of different pathologies was assessed in 80 CP children (35 boys and 45 girls) and 73 UCLP children (47 boys and 26 girls). Ear pathology was reported in 53.8 per cent of CP children and in 58.9 per cent of UCLP children. Nasal breathing was impaired in 14 CP (17.5 per cent) and 36 UCLP (49.3 per cent) children. Dysphonia was detected in 12.5 per cent of CP and 12.3 per cent of UCLP children. In 9.2 per cent of all cleft children, functional voice disorder caused a hoarse voice. Two-thirds of cleft children with functional dysphonia had protracted hearing loss. Therefore, ENT specialists must take an active role early in the treatment of children with clefts.",M3
16644895,"Occupational exposure to organic solvent mixtures during pregnancy and the risk of non-syndromic oral clefts.OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between maternal occupational exposure to mixtures of organic solvents during pregnancy and the risk of non-syndromic oral clefts. METHODS: A case-control study (164 cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), 76 cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), 236 controls) was conducted in France to investigate the role of maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents at the beginning of pregnancy in the risk of non-syndromic oral clefts. An expert chemist, guided by a detailed description of the women's occupational tasks, assessed exposure for each. Analysis of the findings used logistic regression. RESULTS: In the control group, 39% of the women who reported working during pregnancy were exposed to at least one type of organic solvent. The risk of oral clefts was associated with oxygenated (for CL/P: OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9; and for CP, OR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.7), chlorinated (OR = 9.4, 95% CI 2.5 to 35.3; OR = 3.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 20.7), and petroleum (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.8; OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.3 to 4.9) solvents. The risk of oral clefts increased linearly with level of exposure within the three subgroups of oxygenated solvents we considered (aliphatic alcohols, glycol ethers, and other oxygenated solvents, including esters, ketones, and aliphatic aldehydes). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents during pregnancy may play a role in the aetiology of oral clefts. The limited number of subjects and the problem of multiple exposures require that these results be interpreted cautiously.",M3
16425788,"[Low zinc and high copper levels in mothers of children with isolated cleft lip and palate]Changes in orofacial development have been reported in offspring of animals treated with copper injections or low zinc diet during pregnancy. The aim of our study was to determine serum levels of zinc and copper in mothers of children with non-syndromic orofacial clefts and in women who gave birth to healthy children. Ninety six healthy women participated in the study: 35 mothers of children with cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP), 30 mothers of children with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) and 31 control mothers of healthy children. Serum zinc and copper concentrations were determined by the use of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). RESULTS: Between CLP and controls there were significant differences in mean zinc levels (511 +/- 121 microg/L vs 572 +/- 76 microg/L, p = 0.012) and copper levels (991 +/- 388 microg/L vs 810 +/- 201 microg/L, p = 0.02). In CP mean serum zinc and copper levels were 540 +/- 130 microg/L and 846 +/- 291 microg/L. The ratio of serum zinc to copper levels was significantly lower in CLP comparing to CP and controls (0.57 +/- 0.19 vs 0.67 +/- 0.18 and 0.74 +/- 0.19, p = 0.003).

16570024,"Maternal nutrient intakes and risk of orofacial clefts.BACKGROUND: Information about nutritional factors as potential risks of orofacial clefts is limited. METHODS: In this population-based case-control study, we investigated whether periconceptional intakes of supplemental folic acid, dietary folate, and several other nutrients were associated with orofacial clefts. We included data on deliveries from 1997 through 2000 in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Orofacial cleft cases were infants or fetuses born with cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) or with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP). Infants without malformations were eligible as controls. Interview participation was 71% among case mothers and 68% among control mothers. Interviews were completed for 704 CLP cases, 404 CP cases, and 2594 controls. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for CLP associated with use of vitamin supplements containing folic acid was 0.88 (95% confidence interval = 0.73-1.07) and for CP was 1.09 (0.84-1.40). Adjusting for maternal race/ethnicity, age, and education produced an OR of 1.01 (0.82-1.24) for CLP and 1.02 (0.77-1.34) for CP. We found some evidence for decreased CLP risks (&gt;or=30% reduction in risk) with increasing intakes of total protein, choline, and methionine. Decreased CP risk was associated with increased intake of cysteine. Intakes of only 2 micronutrients, iron and riboflavin, were found to reduce CLP risk when adjusted for other nutrients. CONCLUSION: Our observations contribute to the limited body of evidence suggesting a woman's periconceptional diet may influence clefting risks in her offspring. Our finding of no reduction in clefting risk with periconceptional use of supplements containing folic acid is inconsistent with many previous observations but not all.",M3
16280236,"Influence of season on prevalence of cleft lip and palate.According to the multifactorial threshold (MFT) model, cleft lip and palate (CLP) result from the influence of exogenous and endogenous genetic factors.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of case-control cephalometric data. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies were selected if the unaffected parents of children with CL/P were included and were not combined with parents of children with isolated <e>CP</e>; quantitative data were obtained through cephalometry; the cephalometric variables used were not unique to a study; a case-control design was used; and the means and standard deviations for all variables were reported or could be calculated for both the experimental and the control group. OUTCOME MEASURE: Using raw data obtained from nine studies, mean weighted effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 28 cephalometric variables (mothers and fathers combined) or 18 variables (mothers and fathers separately). Heterogeneity statistics for the effect sizes were also calculated. RESULTS: In general, unaffected parents of children with CL/P possessed significantly wider interorbital, nasal cavity and upper facial dimensions, narrower cranial vaults, longer cranial bases, longer and more protrusive mandibles, shorter upper faces and longer lower faces compared with controls. Increased width of the nasal cavity was the most robust finding. Significant effect size heterogeneity was observed in roughly half of the variables examined. CONCLUSION: Unaffected parents of children with CL/P are characterized by a suite of consistent, yet subtle, craniofacial differences, which could indicate an underlying genetic liability.",M3
16243237,"Nasal airflow and olfactory function after the repair of cleft palate (with and without cleft lip).OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine nasal airflow and olfactory functions in patients with repaired cleft palate compared with matching normal controls. STUDY DESIGN: The all-cleft group consisted of 25 patients with hard palate cleft comprising 15 patients with unilateral cleft palate and lip (UCLP); 2 with <e>CP</e> but no cleft lip (UCLP subgroup) and 8 patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP subgroup). All had had surgical correction of the palate in infancy. The control group consisted of 20 nonaffected orthodontic patients. The median age of both groups was 14 years. The tests included the following: (1) nasal airflow measured by anterior rhinomanometry, (2) smell threshold for isoamyl-acetate determined using a 3-way forced choice method, (3) a self-administered questionnaire regarding the subjective perception of smell sense function, and (4) orthonasal and retronasal smell identification (correct/incorrect) and hedonics using visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The respective test results follow. (1) When compared with the control group, the total airflow in the UCLP subgroup was significantly lower especially on the affected side; while in the BCLP subgroup it was lower than in the control group bilaterally. No significant difference was found between the cleft side of UCLP and BCLP subgroups. (2) The smell threshold of the UCLP subgroup was significantly higher than that of the control group and BCLP subgroup. No significant differences were found between right and left nostrils within the BCLP patients and between them and the control group. (3) No difference was found between the groups regarding the subjective perception of smell. (4) No significant differences were found between the UCLP and BCLP subgroups and between the all-cleft group and the control group, except for one item, regarding orthonasal and retronasal smell identification and hedonics. CONCLUSION: Although nasal airflow is significantly lower and the smell threshold higher on the cleft side, the day-to-day function of the sense of smell of cleft patients is similar to that of normal controls.",M3

METHODS: A case-control study was conducted using 74 case mothers of children with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P, n=57) or cleft palate alone (<e>CP</e>, n=17), and 283 control mothers of unaffected children recruited in the Philippines in early 2003. Maternal zinc status was assessed by determining plasma zinc concentrations a mean of 5 years after delivery of the index child. Odds ratios (ORs) of estimates of the relative risk of oral clefts were calculated for quartiles of maternal plasma zinc concentrations. RESULTS: The mean plasma zinc concentration of CL/P case mothers (9.6+/-1.2, SD micromol/l) was significantly lower than that in control mothers (10.1+/-1.6 micromol/l; P&lt;0.05). Low plasma zinc concentrations (&lt;11.0 micromol/l) were found in 88% and 94% of CL/P and CP case mothers, respectively, and in 72% of controls (P&lt;0.05). The ORs for CL/P and CP combined, adjusted for potential confounding factors, decreased with increasing quartile of plasma zinc as follows: 1.0 (lowest quartile reference), 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.37-1.89), 0.70 (0.31-1.68), and 0.26 (0.10-0.70) (P trend=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma zinc concentrations were common in Filipino women of reproductive age, and higher plasma zinc concentrations were associated with a lower risk for oral clefts in their children.",M3
16106444,"Maternal diseases and isolated orofacial clefts in Hungary.BACKGROUND: Isolated orofacial clefts (OFCs) are likely to be caused by gene-environment interaction; therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the possible association between all maternal diseases during pregnancy and isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-<e>CP</e>) and posterior cleft palate (PCP) in the offspring. METHODS: The database of the large population-based Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities, 1980-1996, was evaluated. The database includes 1374 cases with isolated CL+/- CP and 601 with PCP, plus 38,151 matched population controls (without defects) and 20,868 patient controls with other defects. Data collection was based on prospective medical records, retrospective maternal data via a self-reported questionnaire, and home visits of nonresponding families. RESULTS: An increased risk for isolated CL+/- CP was found for children born to mothers with influenza, common cold, orofacial herpes, and gastroenteritis during pregnancy. Risk for isolated PCP was increased in children of mothers with influenza, sinusitis, and bronchitis. Among chronic maternal diseases, epilepsy and angina pectoris showed a higher prevalence in the mothers of children born with isolated OFCs (cases). CONCLUSIONS: Some maternal diseases are risk factors for the pathogenesis of isolated OFCs. It is worth considering the prevention of possible harmful effects of influenza by vaccination during the expected epidemic period.",M3

16054854,"Genetic variation in the proto-oncogene SKI and risk for orofacial clefting.BACKGROUND: SKI is a proto-oncogene that is required for development of the central nervous system and skeletal muscle, and is involved in specifying selected cranial neural-crest-derived craniofacial structures. To identify genetic variants within the SKI gene and investigate the potential association between SKI polymorphisms and risk for orofacial defects, we initially re-sequenced the gene. METHODS: DNA re-sequencing of all seven exons of the SKI gene was performed on 100 control samples. Subsequently, we genotyped 394 samples (148 CLP cases, 99 <e>CP</e> cases, and 147 control infants) for a novel SNP identified in the DNA re-sequencing effort using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: We identified one polymorphism in exon 1 of the SKI gene (257C&gt;G) from controls. This SNP resulted in an amino acid change from alanine to glycine (A62G, GenBank Accession No. NM_003036). Among all samples genotyped by the RFLP method, variants (CG, GG) were found in 10.5% of the cases, compared to a prevalence of 17.7% in the controls. The odds ratio was calculated to be 0.6, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.3-1.0. CONCLUSION: In a population of California infants with craniofacial defects, a novel polymorphism of the SKI gene was found to be associated with a decreased risk for orofacial defects. The function of this polymorphism and how it might confer protection to the embryo against craniofacial malformations is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",M3
15957537,"Protein kinase C and chemical-induced abnormal palate development.The protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins mediates the action of growth factors and other ligands by activating a network of transcription factors that bind to TRE sequences in the promoters of many genes that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix synthesis, apoptosis and others in a cell type-, isozyme- and context-specific manner. The critical role of PKC in embryonic development is indicated by early death of embryos in which one or more of these isozymes are inactivated. Our studies together with others show that palatal PKC signalling is functional and may be essential for normal palate development. Although single gene knockouts have failed to exhibit the cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) phenotype, owing to compensation by other kinases, many chemicals including the mycotoxin, secalonic acid D, disrupt palatal PKC signalling leading to altered palatal mesenchymal gene expression. The potential relevance of such effects to chemical-induced CP is discussed.",M3
16001924,"Cross-sectional study of the length of the nasal bone in cleft lip and palate subjects.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the human nasal bone length in newborns and male adults with cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (<e>CP</e>), and unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and to compare the results to previous findings in prenatal material. DESIGN: This study was a radiographic profile cephalometric cross-sectional analysis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Profile radiographs from 60 newborns with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 in each group (20 CL, 20 CP, and 20 UCLP) and 60 male adults (20 CL, 20 CP, and 20 UCLP) were randomly selected among radiographs, taken for optimizing the treatment planning. The nasal bone lengths (n-na) were measured with a digital caliper on the profile radiographs. To compare the nasal bone lengths in the different cleft groups, Student's t tests at a significant level at 5% were performed. RESULTS: Nasal bone length was significantly shorter in male adult patients with CL compared with patients with CP. Furthermore, the nasal bone length was significantly shorter in newborns with CL (2 months) compared to newborns with UCLP (2 months). A borderline significance was seen in the comparison of patients with CL and UCLP in male adults. There was no significant difference in the nasal bone length between the patients with CP and UCLP, in either the newborns or the male adults. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal bone length was significantly shorter in subjects with CL compared with subjects in whom the palate was clefted. The results show that the clefted lip in CL is associated with a subjacent skeletal deviation in the upper midface.",M3
15880679,"Secalonic acid D blocks embryonic palatal mesenchymal cell-cycle by altering the activity of CDK2 and the expression of p21 and cyclin E.BACKGROUND: The mycotoxin, secalonic acid D (SAD), a known animal and potential human cleft palate (<e>CP</e>)-inducing agent, is produced by Pencillium oxalicum in corn. SAD selectively inhibits proliferation of murine embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cells leading to a reduction in cell numbers. These effects can explain the reduction in shelf size and the resulting CP seen in the offspring of SAD-exposed mice. Ability of SAD to inhibit proliferation as well as to block the progression of cells from G1- to S-phase of the cell-cycle were also shown in the human embryonic palatal mesenchymal (HEPM) cells suggesting the potential CP-inducing effect of SAD in human beings METHODS: Gestation day (GD) 12 mouse embryos and HEPM cells were used to test the hypothesis that the cell-cycle block induced by SAD results from a disruption of stage-specific regulatory components both in vivo and in vitro. The effects of SAD on the activity of various cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and on the levels of various positive (cyclins and CDK) and negative (CDK inhibitors p15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 27, 57) cell-cycle regulators were assessed by performing kinase assays and immunoblots, respectively. RESULTS: In the murine embryonic palates, SAD specifically inhibited G1/S-phase-specific CDK2 activity, reduced the level of cyclin E and tended to increase the level of the CIP/kip CDK inhibitor, p21. In the HEPM cell cultures, exposure to IC50 of SAD significantly affected all of the above targets. In addition, a reduction in the levels/activity of CDK 4/6, a reduction in the levels of cyclins D1, D2, D3, E, A, and all INK4 family proteins, and an increase in the level of the CIP/kip CDK inhibitor, p57, were also seen. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the S-phase-specific cell-cycle proteins CDK2, cyclin E and possibly p21 are the common targets of SAD in murine palatal shelves in vivo and in human embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells in vitro and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of SAD-induced CP.",M3
15955575,"Hearing and speech assessment of cleft palate patients after palatal closure. Long-term results.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was the development of a clinical methodology to assess speech and hearing impairment 5 years after the primary surgical repair of the cleft and, further, to determine the relative importance and long-term consequences of each cleft type and age to the velopharyngeal and eustachian tube function in patients who did not undergo pharyngeal flap surgery following primary palatoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated with a certain assessment protocol hearing and speech abilities of 42 patients between 5 and 15 years of age: 9 with <e>CP</e> (cleft of the soft and hard palate), 19 with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), 14 with bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), surgically treated by a team of surgeons using two different surgical techniques between 18 and 24 months of age. ACCORDING TO OUR RESULTS WE WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE: (a) the impact of hearing impairment to the development of speech in these patients. (b) The relation of hypernasality with compansatory articulation. (c) The influence of cleft type, by means of extent of the cleft palatal musculature, to speech integrity. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of our patients presented with mild and moderate hearing loss. Hypernasality was observed in 40.5%, compensatory articulation in 28.5% of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated: (a) a simultaneous appearance of speech and hearing impairment at the same age for each cleft type post-surgically in our patients; (b) that the muscular and vomer complex rather than the anatomic extent of the cleft is a significant factor for speech outcome after surgical repair; and (c) that hypernasality is exacerbated by compensatory articulation.",M3
15826874,"Correlation of susceptibility to 6-aminonicotinamide and hydrocortisone-induced cleft palate.Our previous genome-wide Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping study using mouse A/J by C57BL/6J recombinant inbred (RI) lines suggested several chromosomal regions contain genes influencing susceptibility to phenytoin (PT)-induced cleft lip with or without cleft palate [CL(P)] and 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN)-induced isolated cleft palate (<e>CP</e>). Importantly, the same chromosomal regions but different RI parental strain alleles were sometimes implicated in susceptibility to these different kinds of orofacial clefting. Here we report the susceptibility to hydrocortisone (HC)-induced CP in these RI lines. We treated pregnant females with HC and studied the incidence of CP in day 17 fetuses. RI lines showed highly correlated responses to HC and 6-AN. The A/J parental line and five RI lines showed very high levels of clefting in response to both of these teratogens. The C57BL/6J parental line and five other RI lines exhibited low incidence of CP for these teratogens. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between incidence of PT-induced CL(P) and HC-induced CP.",M3
15806447,"Part 1. Understanding the embryology and genetics of cleft lip and palate.Craniofacial birth defects are the fourth most common congenital anomaly in newborns. Cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/<e>CP</e>) are the most common and immediately recognizable craniofacial anomalies. Some are diagnosed prenatally on ultrasound; more often, they are first noted in the delivery room. The infant may have a cleft that is unilateral, bilateral, complete, or incomplete, and it may involve the lip only, the palate only, or both. Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are often isolated nonsyndromic occurrences; however, when associated with other abnormal physical findings, a recognizable syndrome may be present. Part 1 of this 2-part article describes the incidence of CL/CP. The embryology of the face, lip, and palate are reviewed to enhance the understanding of the timing, complexity, and factors that may influence the development of this lesion. The emerging genetic links, environmental influences, and potential teratogens that may interact to contribute to CL/CP are discussed. Part 2 of this series will provide clinicians with tools to perform a focused risk assessment and obtain a detailed family and pregnancy history to evaluate for known associated risk factors for CL/CP. The article provides a guide for a systematic physical examination of infants with CL/CP. Careful assessment for other midline defects or physical findings consistent with associated syndromes is also discussed. Pictorial examples of a variety of forms of CL/CP are provided to enhance understanding of the spectrum of this defect. Treatment and long-term complications of CL/CP are reviewed with an emphasis on family support, identifying educational resources, and counseling.",M3
15804585,"An epidemiological study of orofacial clefts in Croatia 1988-1998.INTRODUCTION: The objective of this epidemiological study was to assess the incidence at birth of orofacial clefts in Croatia. AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyse the character and incidence of orofacial clefts in Croatia and to compare the data with reports from other countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the material for the epidemiological study was retrieved from the documented files from all the neonatal units and hospitals in Croatia providing surgical treatment. RESULTS: A total of 525,298 livebirths were documented during 11 years (1988-1998); 903 among them with orofacial clefts, 24 (2.7%) of them twins. Sixty (6.6%) infants died between birth and the age of 6 months. The incidence of orofacial clefts during the study period was 1.71 per thousand. When eliminating syndromic clefts, the incidence of non-syndromic clefts was 1.56 per thousand. Analysis of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P) and isolated cleft palate only (<e>CP</e>) revealed their incidence to be 1.05 and 0.66 per 1000, respectively. Of all types of clefting, CL and CLA was found in 17.2%, CL+/-P in 43.9%, CP in 38.2% and atypical facial clefts (AFC) in 0.8% of children. Left-sided clefts were most common (51%), followed by bilateral (30.5%) and right-sided (18.5%) clefts. The male to female ratio was 1.3. CL+/-P predominated in male and CP in female children. In 220 cases (24.4%) orofacial clefts were either associated with other anomalies or the clefts occurred as one feature of a syndrome. CONCLUSION: Data obtained from different sources yielded a cleft incidence of 1.71 per 1000 in Croatia. There were no differences in the incidences of orofacial clefts in comparison with similar data from other European countries.",M3
15799028,"Teratogenic effects of retinoic acid are modulated in mice lacking expression of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-alpha.BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in the embryo. The induction of cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) by all trans-retinoic acid (RA) was associated with altered expression of TGFalpha, EGF receptor, and binding of EGF. This study uses knockout (KO) mice to examine the roles of EGF and TGFalpha in teratogenic responses of embryos exposed to RA. METHODS: Pregnant wild-type (WT) mice of mixed genetic background, EGF KO, C57BL/6J, and TGFalpha KO mice were given a single oral dose of RA (100 mg/kg, 10 ml/kg) or corn oil on GD 10 at 12 PM, GD 11 at 12 PM or 4 PM, or GD 12 at 8 AM or 12 PM (plug day = GD 0). GD 18 fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal effects. RESULTS: After exposure to RA on GD 12, the incidence of CP in EGF KO was significantly reduced relative to WT. In TGFalpha KO fetuses, RA exposure on GD 10 increased the incidence of CP versus C57BL/6J. The incidence of skeletal defects in the limbs, vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs were also affected by lack of expression of EGF or TGFalpha with region-specific amelioration or exacerbation of the effects of RA. In TGFalpha KO fetuses, incidences of forelimb long bone and digit defects increased relative to C57BL/6J. In EGF KO fetuses, relative to WT, the incidence of hindlimb oligodactyly was increased. In EGF KO, but not WT, RA produced short, bent radius, humerus, and ulna. Both TGFalpha and EGF KO mice had increased incidences of dilation of the renal pelvis and this was reduced by RA. CONCLUSIONS: RA exposure produced skeletal and visceral defects in all genotypes; however, EGF or TGFalpha KO influenced the incidence and severity of defects. This study supports a role for EGF and TGFalpha in the response to RA.",M3
15733594,"Speech summer camp for treating articulation disorders in cleft palate patients.INTRODUCTION: Compensatory articulation disorder (CAD) severely affects speech intelligibility of cleft palate children. CAD must be treated with speech therapy. Children can manage articulation better when they use language in event contexts such as every day routines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to study and compare two modalities of speech intervention in cleft palate children with associated CAD. The first modality is a conventional approach providing speech therapy in 1-h sessions, twice a week. The second modality is a speech summer camp in which children received therapy 4h per day, 5 days a week for a period of 3 weeks. We were aimed to determine if a speech summer camp could significantly enhance articulation in <e>CP</e> children with CAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five children with repaired cleft palates who exhibited CAD were studied. A matched control group of 45 children with repaired cleft palate who also exhibited CAD were identified. The patients included in the first group attended a speech summer camp for 3 weeks. The matched control subjects included in the second group received speech therapy aimed to correct CAD twice per-week in 1-h sessions. RESULTS: At the onset of either the summer camp or the speech therapy period, the severity of CAD was evenly distributed with non-significant differences across both groups of patients (p &gt; 0.05). After the summer camp (3 weeks) or 12 months of speech therapy sessions at a frequency of twice per-week, both groups of patients showed a significant decrease in the severity of their CAD (p &lt; 0.05). However, when the distribution of the severity of CAD was compared at the end of the summer camp or the speech therapy period, non-significant differences were found between both groups of patients (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A speech summer camp is a valid and efficient method for providing speech therapy in cleft palate children with compensatory articulation disorder.",M3
15643916,"Oral clefts, maternal smoking, and TGFA: a meta-analysis of gene-environment interaction.OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was performed to examine the association among maternal cigarette smoking, infant genotype at the Taq1 site in the transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) locus, and risk of nonsyndromic oral clefts, both cleft palate (<e>CP</e>) and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). DESIGN: Five published case-control studies were included in the meta-analyis. Pooled Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Gene-environment interaction was also assessed by using the pooled data in a case-only analysis and polytomous logistic regression. RESULTS: Among nonsmoking mothers, there was no evidence of any increased risk for CP if the infant carried the TGFA Taq1 C2 allele. If the mother reported smoking, however, there was an overall increased risk for CP if the infant carried the C2 allele (ORsmokers = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.10). TGFA genotype did not increase risk to CL/P, regardless of maternal smoking status. Polytomous logistic regression revealed a significant overall smoking effect for CL/P (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.02) and CP (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.90). CONCLUSIONS: While maternal smoking was a consistent risk factor for both CL/P and CP across all studies, the suggestive evidence for gene-environment interaction between the infant's genotype at the Taq1 marker in TGFA and maternal smoking was limited to CP. Furthermore, evidence for such gene-environment interaction was strongest in a case-control study drawn from a birth defect registry where infants with non-cleft defects served as controls.",M3
15516165,"Descriptive epidemiology of oral clefts in a multiethnic population, Hawaii, 1986-2000.OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between oral clefts and demographic and clinical factors in Hawaii. METHODS: Data were obtained from a birth defects registry and included all infants and fetuses with oral clefts delivered during 1986 through 2000. Subjects were categorized as total, isolated, and nonisolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P) or cleft palate without cleft lip (<e>CP</e>). RESULTS: There were 352 total subjects of CL+/-P and 192 total subjects of CP with corresponding rates per 10,000 live births of 12.5 for CL+/-P and 6.8 for CP. Total, isolated, and nonisolated CL+/-P rates demonstrated no clear pattern by maternal age. The total and nonisolated CP rates tended to be higher among older maternal age groups. The total CL+/-P rate was higher among Far East Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos than among whites. The total CP rate was higher among Far East Asians and Pacific Islanders than among whites, whereas the rate for Filipinos was lower than for whites. The total CL+/-P rate was substantially lower among females (rate ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.77) and the total CP rate substantially higher among females (rate ratio 1.52, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.06). Both CL+/-P and CP were more common with lower birth weight and gestational age among the total, isolated, and nonisolated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cleft risk was associated with maternal race/ethnicity, sex, birth weight, and gestational age. Although some of the observed associations were consistent with the literature, others were not.",M3
15516164,"Predisposing factors to formation of cleft lip and palate: inherited craniofacial skeletal morphology.OBJECTIVE: To identify inherited craniofacial morphologic features in individuals at high risk for cleft of the lip, cleft palate, or both. SUBJECTS: Twins without cleft from 33 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for cleft lip, cleft palate, or both were studied. There were 17 males and 16 females of Caucasian origin, ranging from 3 to 18 years (15 with cleft lip and palate [CLP], 10 with cleft lip [CL], and 8 with cleft palate [<e>CP</e>]), collected from five craniofacial centers (United States and Canada). DESIGN: The twin without cleft (noncleft) from each set was compared with an age- and sex-matched control individual from the Burlington Growth Centre, Toronto, Ontario. Posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms were traced and digitized using a computer custom analysis. Descriptive statistics, Student's t tests, and analysis of variance were used to test 40 variables in a pilot study comparing the noncleft twin groups with the controls. Preliminary analysis permitted pooling of the CLP and CL groups (n = 25). To minimize false-positive significance, only 14 variables (from the maxillofacial area) were tested. RESULTS: Using the raw probabilities, eight variables showed significant differences between the pooled noncleft CLP and CL (CL[P]) twin group and the controls. However, when the level of significance was adjusted, only four (nasal width [p &lt; .01], cranial base length [p &lt; .05], cranial base width/length ratio [p &lt; .001], and maxillary width/length ratio [p &lt; .05]) were significantly different. No significant differences were confirmed between the noncleft CP twin group and the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The noncleft member of a discordant monozygotic pair has a number of facial characteristics that differ from the general population. These may predispose to the formation of a cleft lip or palate and may result from a deficiency or distortion of the mesenchyme that forms the craniofacial structures.",M3
15368494,"Significant association between nonsyndromic oral clefts and arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT).The etiology of nonsyndromic oral clefts (cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate) is still controversial, but is considered to involve both genetic and environmental factors. One of suspected environmental factors is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) found in tobacco, herbicides, contaminated soil, and food. TCDD administered during organogenesis in mice causes a high incidence of <e>CP</e> in fetuses. There is ample evidence that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) are involved in TCDD metabolism. We assessed whether there is any association in the Japanese population of nonsyndromic oral clefts with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHR, ARNT, and CYP1A1 genes using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and case-control study. We identified and investigated three SNPs in ARNT; 567G/C (V189V), IVS12-19T/G, and 2117C/T (P706L). Two amino acid substitutions, R554L in AHR and I462V in CYP1A1, were also investigated. In the TDT, the C allele of ARNT 567G/C was preferentially transmitted to patients (P = 0.033). When a haplotype consisting of 567G/C and IVS12-19T/G in ARNT was considered, the preferential transmission of the CT (567C-IVS12-19T) haplotype was observed (P = 0.0012). In a case-control study, a significant association of IVS12-19T/G in ARNT was observed (P = 0.021). The SNPs studied in AHR and CYP1A1 were not associated with the disease. Our results suggest that ARNT is involved in the development of nonsyndromic oral clefts in the Japanese population.",M3
