20336511,"The role of electron microscopy in the rapid diagnosis of viral infections--review.Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) allows fast visualization of viruses in a wide range of clinical specimens. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from various families look distinctly and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. The identification to the family level is often sufficient for the clinician or recognition of an unknown infectious agent. Diagnostic EM has two advantages over enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nucleic acid amplification tests. After a simple and fast negative staining, EM allows fast morphological identification and differential diagnosis of infectious agents contained in the specimen without the need for special considerations and/or reagents. Nevertheless, EM has the disadvantage of being unsuitable as a screening method.",M1
20303958,"Imaging of organelles by electron microscopy reveals protein-protein interactions in mitochondria and chloroplasts.Ongoing progress in electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) offers now an opening to visualize cells at the nanoscale by cryo-electron tomography (ET). Large protein complexes can be resolved at near-atomic resolution by single particle averaging. Some examples from mitochondria and chloroplasts illustrate the possibilities with an emphasis on the membrane organization. Cryo-ET performed on non-chemically fixed, unstained, ice-embedded material can visualize specific large membrane protein complexes. In combination with averaging methods, 3D structures were calculated of mitochondrial ATP synthase at 6 nm resolution and of chloroplast photosystem II at 3.5 nm.",M1
20165942,"Analysis of particulate contaminations of infusion solutions in a pediatric intensive care unit.PURPOSE: To examine the physical properties and chemical composition of particles captured by in-line microfilters in critically ill children, and to investigate the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of particles on endothelial cells (HUVEC) and macrophages in vitro. METHODS: Prospective, observational study of microfilters following their use in the pediatric intensive care unit. In vitro model utilizing cytokine assays to investigate the effects of particles on human endothelial cells and murine macrophages. RESULTS: Twenty filter membranes from nine patients and five controls were examined by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) and energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDX). The average number of particles found on the surface of the used membranes was 550 cm(2). EDX analysis confirmed silicon as a major particle constituent. Half of the filter membranes showed conglomerates containing an unaccountable number of smaller particles. In vitro, glass particles were used to mimic the high silicon content particles. HUVEC and murine macrophages were exposed to different contents of particles, and cytokine levels were assayed to assess their immune response. Levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: Particle contamination of infusion solutions exists despite a stringent infusion regiment. The number and composition of particles depends on the complexity of the applied admixtures. Beyond possible physical effects, the suppression of macrophage and endothelial cell cytokine secretion in vitro suggests that microparticle infusion in vivo may have immune-modulating effects. Further clinical trials are necessary to determine whether particle retention by in-line filtration has an influence on the outcome of intensive care patients.",M1
20118404,"Abnormal VWF modifies megakaryocytopoiesis: studies of platelets and megakaryocyte cultures from patients with von Willebrand disease type 2B.von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an essential mediator of platelet adhesion to the vessel wall, but little is known about its role in megakaryocytopoiesis. VWF and its platelet receptor, glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIbalpha), are both expressed during megakaryocyte (MK) maturation. This study was designed to evaluate whether the enhanced VWF-GPIbalpha interactions typical of patients with von Willebrand disease type 2B (VWD2B) modify platelet production. Platelets from 9 patients with VWD2B with 7 different gain-of-function mutations were examined by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) and immunofluorescence labeling. For the patients with VWD2B, EM characteristically showed variable numbers of structurally abnormal giant platelets, sometimes in agglutinates. Cultures of MKs from controls performed with or without purified VWF confirmed a positive influence of VWF on platelet production with specific inhibition by an antibody blocking VWF binding to GPIbalpha. VWD2B MK cultures examined by EM showed a disorganized demarcation membrane system and abnormal granule distribution. They produced platelets with structural abnormalities typical of VWD2B. Confocal examination of MK revealed limited extension of pseudopods with few large proplatelets. These results confirm that megakaryocytopoiesis is modified by the enhanced VWF-GPIbalpha interactions. These data obtained for controls and patients with VWD2B suggest a novel regulatory role of VWF-GPIbalpha interactions in platelet production.",M1
20062530,"Structure of the hDmc1-ssDNA filament reveals the principles of its architecture.In eukaryotes, meiotic recombination is a major source of genetic diversity, but its defects in humans lead to abnormalities such as Down's, Klinefelter's and other syndromes. Human Dmc1 (hDmc1), a RecA/Rad51 homologue, is a recombinase that plays a crucial role in faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis. The initial step of homologous recombination occurs when hDmc1 forms a filament on single-stranded (ss) DNA. However the structure of this presynaptic complex filament for hDmc1 remains unknown. To compare hDmc1-ssDNA complexes to those known for the RecA/Rad51 family we have obtained electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) structures of hDmc1-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments using single particle approach. The EM maps were analysed by docking crystal structures of Dmc1, Rad51, RadA, RecA and DNA. To fully characterise hDmc1-DNA complexes we have analysed their organisation in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, AMP-PNP, ssDNA and dsDNA. The 3D EM structures of the hDmc1-ssDNA filaments allowed us to elucidate the principles of their internal architecture. Similar to the RecA/Rad51 family, hDmc1 forms helical filaments on ssDNA in two states: extended (active) and compressed (inactive). However, in contrast to the RecA/Rad51 family, and the recently reported structure of hDmc1-double stranded (ds) DNA nucleoprotein filaments, the extended (active) state of the hDmc1 filament formed on ssDNA has nine protomers per helical turn, instead of the conventional six, resulting in one protomer covering two nucleotides instead of three. The control reconstruction of the hDmc1-dsDNA filament revealed 6.4 protein subunits per helical turn indicating that the filament organisation varies depending on the DNA templates. Our structural analysis has also revealed that the N-terminal domain of hDmc1 accomplishes its important role in complex formation through domain swapping between adjacent protomers, thus providing a mechanistic basis for coordinated action of hDmc1 protomers during meiotic recombination.",M1

20004160,"Averaging of electron subtomograms and random conical tilt reconstructions through likelihood optimization.The reference-free averaging of three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-<e>EM</e>) reconstructions with empty regions in Fourier space represents a pressing problem in electron tomography and single-particle analysis. We present a maximum likelihood algorithm for the simultaneous alignment and classification of subtomograms or random conical tilt (RCT) reconstructions, where the Fourier components in the missing data regions are treated as hidden variables. The behavior of this algorithm was explored using tests on simulated data, while application to experimental data was shown to yield unsupervised class averages for subtomograms of groEL/groES complexes and RCT reconstructions of p53. The latter application served to obtain a reliable de novo structure for p53 that may resolve uncertainties about its quaternary structure.",M1
19965615,"An optimized negative-staining protocol of electron microscopy for apoE4 POPC lipoprotein.Apolipoprotein E (apoE), one of the major protein components of lipoproteins in the peripheral and central nervous systems, regulates cholesterol metabolism through its interaction with members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. One key to understanding apoE function is determining the structure of lipid-bound forms of apoE. Negative-staining (NS) electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) is an easy and rapid approach for studying the structure and morphology of lipid-bound forms of apoE. However, an artifact of using the conventional NS protocol is that the apoE phospholipid particles form rouleaux. In this study, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to examine apoE4 palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) particles in a frozen-hydrated native state. By comparing the particle sizes and shapes produced by different NS protocols to those produced by cryo-EM, we propose an optimized protocol to examine apoE4 POPC particles. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the particle sizes differ by less than 5% between the optimized protocol and the cryo-EM method, with similar shapes. The high contrast and fine detail of particle images produced using this optimized protocol lend themselves to the structural study of lipid-bound forms of apoE.",M1
19935684,"Reconstitution of both steps of Saccharomyces cerevisiae splicing with purified spliceosomal components.The spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein machine that removes introns from pre-mRNA in a two-step reaction. To investigate the catalytic steps of splicing, we established an in vitro splicing complementation system. Spliceosomes stalled before step 1 of this process were purified to near-homogeneity from a temperature-sensitive mutant of the RNA helicase Prp2, compositionally defined, and shown to catalyze efficient step 1 when supplemented with recombinant Prp2, Spp2 and Cwc25, thereby demonstrating that Cwc25 has a previously unknown role in promoting step 1. Step 2 catalysis additionally required Prp16, Slu7, Prp18 and Prp22. Our data further suggest that Prp2 facilitates catalytic activation by remodeling the spliceosome, including destabilizing the SF3a and SF3b proteins, likely exposing the branch site before step 1. Remodeling by Prp2 was confirmed by negative stain <e>EM</e> and image processing. This system allows future mechanistic analyses of spliceosome activation and catalysis.",M1
19923921,"Investigating autophagy: quantitative morphometric analysis using electron microscopy.Autophagy is a compensatory pathway involving isolation and subsequent degradation of cytosolic material and organelles in eukaryotic cells.(1) The autophagic process can provide a  housekeeping  function by removing damaged proteins and organelles in a selective or nonselective fashion in order to exert a protective effect following stress.(2) Remarkably, after being discovered to be much more of a targeted process than a random one, the role of autophagy became implicated in many normal cellular and disease processes.(3) Several methodologies are routinely employed to monitor the entire autophagic process.(4) Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8, has been widely used as a specific marker to monitor autophagy in numerous cell types.(5) While monitoring autophagic flux is extremely important, it is also beneficial to perform a detailed analysis by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) to evaluate changes in various autophagic structures, quantify the areas involved, and determine if any particular organelle(s) or area of the cell cytoplasm is being targeted for degradation.(6) The following article describes methods to localize and quantify subcellular areas of autophagy using transmission EM. Also discussed are methods for subcellular localization of specific proteins by employing immunogold EM; this method becomes particularly useful in detecting early changes in cellular homeostasis that may occur before later signs of cellular insult can be observed morphologically.",M1
19922289,"Convolutional networks can learn to generate affinity graphs for image segmentation.Many image segmentation algorithms first generate an affinity graph and then partition it. We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize effectively to arbitrary image types.",M1
19910612,"Diagnostic testing of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia.RATIONALE: Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) of ciliated epithelium is widely used to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) has been used to screen samples to determine whether EM is indicated. Beat pattern analysis has been advocated as an additional diagnostic test. Neither has been subject to formal review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of CBF and beat pattern analysis to predict EM-diagnosed PCD. METHODS: CBF calculation and beat pattern analysis, using high-speed video microscopy, and EM were performed on nasal tissue from 371 patients consecutively referred to the Leicester Royal Infirmary for diagnostic assessment for PCD. With EM as the  gold standard,  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated for CBF less than 11 Hz, ciliary dyskinesia score equal to or exceeding 2, at least 90% of ciliated edges beating dyskinetically, and an immotility index equal to or exceeding 10%. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCD was excluded in 270 patients and confirmed in 70 by EM. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for CBF less than 11 Hz were 87.1, 77.2, 50.0, and 95.8%, respectively. These values were higher for ciliary dyskinesia scores equal to or exceeding 2 (92.5, 97.6, 91.2, and 98.0%) and when at least 90% of ciliated edges were dyskinetic (97.1, 95.3, 84.6, and 99.2%). ROCs confirmed that the ciliary dyskinesia score and percentage of dyskinetic edges were superior screening indices compared with CBF and the immotility index. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CBF alone to screen which biopsies should have EM will result in a significant number of missed diagnoses. Ciliary beat pattern analysis is a more sensitive and specific test for PCD with higher PPV and NPV.",M1
19910535,"A double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication.During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. During S phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC MCM2-7 is inactive. The organization of replicative DNA helicases before and after loading onto DNA has been studied in bacteria and viruses but not eukaryotes and is of major importance for understanding the MCM2-7 loading mechanism and replisome assembly. Lack of an efficient reconstituted pre-RC system has hindered the detailed mechanistic and structural analysis of MCM2-7 loading for a long time. We have reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-RC formation with purified proteins and showed efficient loading of MCM2-7 onto origin DNA in vitro. MCM2-7 loading was found to be dependent on the presence of all pre-RC proteins, origin DNA, and ATP hydrolysis. The quaternary structure of MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC formation. Using electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), we observed that loaded MCM2-7 encircles DNA. The loaded MCM2-7 complex can slide on DNA, and sliding is not directional. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks.",M1
19834227,"Scalable and interactive segmentation and visualization of neural processes in <e>EM</e> datasets.Recent advances in scanning technology provide high resolution EM (Electron Microscopy) datasets that allow neuro-scientists to reconstruct complex neural connections in a nervous system. However, due to the enormous size and complexity of the resulting data, segmentation and visualization of neural processes in EM data is usually a difficult and very time-consuming task. In this paper, we present NeuroTrace, a novel EM volume segmentation and visualization system that consists of two parts: a semi-automatic multiphase level set segmentation with 3D tracking for reconstruction of neural processes, and a specialized volume rendering approach for visualization of EM volumes. It employs view-dependent on-demand filtering and evaluation of a local histogram edge metric, as well as on-the-fly interpolation and ray-casting of implicit surfaces for segmented neural structures. Both methods are implemented on the GPU for interactive performance. NeuroTrace is designed to be scalable to large datasets and data-parallel hardware architectures. A comparison of NeuroTrace with a commonly used manual EM segmentation tool shows that our interactive workflow is faster and easier to use for the reconstruction of complex neural processes.",M1
19820710,"Structural insights into RNA processing by the human RISC-loading complex.Targeted gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) requires loading of a short guide RNA (small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA)) onto an Argonaute protein to form the functional center of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In humans, Argonaute2 (AGO2) assembles with the guide RNA-generating enzyme Dicer and the RNA-binding protein TRBP to form a RISC-loading complex (RLC), which is necessary for efficient transfer of nascent siRNAs and miRNAs from Dicer to AGO2. Here, using single-particle <e>EM</e> analysis, we show that human Dicer has an L-shaped structure. The RLC Dicer's N-terminal DExH/D domain, located in a short 'base branch', interacts with TRBP, whereas its C-terminal catalytic domains in the main body are proximal to AGO2. A model generated by docking the available atomic structures of Dicer and Argonaute homologs into the RLC reconstruction suggests a mechanism for siRNA transfer from Dicer to AGO2.",M1
19774668,"Subcellular distribution of low-voltage activated T-type Ca2+ channel subunits (Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.3) in reticular thalamic neurons of the cat.Low-voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) channels play a critical role in the generation of burst firing in the thalamus. Recently, three LVA Ca(2+) channel isoforms (Ca(v)3.1, Ca(v)3.2, Ca(v)3.3) have been identified in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RE). Previous electrophysiological and modelling studies have suggested that kinetically different T-type channels might be expressed in a compartmentalized manner in RE cells. However, their precise subcellular distribution has not been fully elucidated. Using light and electron microscopic (<e>EM</e>) immunocytochemistry, we investigated the subcellular expression pattern of Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.3 channel subunits in RE neurons of the cat. Fluorescent and peroxidase labelling demonstrated the presence of Ca(v)3.1 channel predominantly on the somata and proximal dendrites and Ca(v)3.3 channels on cell bodies. Quantitative immunogold localization disclosed that Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.3 isoforms showed 5.8- and 8.7-fold higher density, respectively, in the cytoplasm compared with somatic plasma membrane. Density of Ca(v)3.1 isoform in the somatic plasma membrane was 2.21-fold higher compared with Ca(v)3.3 subunit. In the dendritic plasma membrane, Ca(v)3.1 channel isoform was expressed throughout the entire dendritic tree. In contrast, Ca(v)3.3 isoform was absent from large-caliber, presumably proximal dendritic segments. Quantitative comparison showed that the relative density of immunogold particles compared with dendritic surface was 8.9- and 14.8-fold higher for Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.3, respectively, in small-diameter dendrites than in large proximal dendritic segments or somata. Our results demonstrate a higher density of low-threshold Ca(2+) channels in distal dendrites and provide further evidence of the role of RE neuron dendrites in the generation of prolonged, low-threshold spike bursts.",M1
19768431,"Imaging cytoskeleton components by electron microscopy.The cytoskeleton is a complex of detergent-insoluble components of the cytoplasm playing critical roles in cell motility, shape generation, and mechanical properties of a cell. Fibrillar polymers-actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments- are major constituents of the cytoskeleton, which constantly change their organization during cellular activities. The actin cytoskeleton is especially polymorphic, as actin filaments can form multiple higher order assemblies performing different functions. Structural information about cytoskeleton organization is critical for understanding its functions and mechanisms underlying various forms of cellular activity. Because of the nanometer-scale thickness of cytoskeletal fibers, electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) is a key tool to determine the structure of the cytoskeleton.This article describes application of rotary shadowing (or metal replica) EM for visualization of the cytoskeleton. The procedure is applicable to thin cultured cells growing on glass coverslips and consists of detergent extraction of cells to expose their cytoskeleton, chemical fixation to provide stability, ethanol dehydration and critical point drying to preserve three-dimensionality, rotary shadowing with platinum to create contrast, and carbon coating to stabilize replicas. This technique provides easily interpretable three-dimensional images, in which individual cytoskeletal fibers are clearly resolved, and individual proteins can be identified by immunogold labeling. More importantly, replica EM is easily compatible with live cell imaging, so that one can correlate the dynamics of a cell or its components, e.g., expressed fluorescent proteins, with high resolution structural organization of the cytoskeleton in the same cell.",M1
19754722,"A review of high-pressure freezing preparation techniques for correlative light and electron microscopy of the same cells and tissues.In this paper, we review some published studies using correlative light and electron microscopy methods. We further refined our criteria to include only those studies using live cells for light microscope and where high-pressure freezing was the method of specimen preparation for electron microscopy. High-pressure freezing is especially important for some difficult-to-fix samples, and for optimal preservation of ultrastructure in samples larger than a few micrometres. How the light microscope observations are done is completely sample dependent, but the choice of high-pressure freezer depends on the speed required to capture (freeze) the biological event of interest. For events requiring high time resolution (in the 4-5 s range) the Leica <e>EM</e> PACT2 with rapid transfer system works well. For correlative work on structures of interest that are either non-motile or moving slowly (minutes rather than seconds), any make of high-pressure freezer will work. We also report on some efforts to improve the capabilities of the Leica EM PACT2 rapid transfer system.",M1
19754720,"Rapid combined light and electron microscopy on large frozen biological samples.The use of large unfixed frozen tissue samples (10 x 10 x 5 mm(3)) for combined light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) is described. First, cryostat sections are applied for various LM histochemical approaches including in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and metabolic mapping (enzyme histochemistry). When EM inspection is needed, the tissue blocks that were used for cryostat sectioning and are stored at -80 degrees C, are then fixed at 4 degrees C with glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde and prepared for EM according to standard procedures. Ultrastructurally, most morphological aspects of normal and pathological tissue are retained whereas cryostat sectioning at -25 degrees C does not have serious damaging effects on the ultrastructure. This approach allows simple and rapid combined LM and EM of relatively large tissue specimens with acceptable ultrastructure. Its use is demonstrated with the elucidation of transdifferentiated mouse stromal elements in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma explants grown subcutaneously in nude mice. Combined LM and EM analysis revealed that these elements resemble cartilage showing enchondral mineralization and aberrant muscle fibres with characteristics of skeletal muscle cells.",M1
19723581,"Localization and orientation of the gamma-tubulin small complex components using protein tags as labels for single particle <e>EM</e>.Gamma-Tubulin Small Complex (gamma-TuSC) is the universally-conserved complex in eukaryotes that contains the microtubule (MT) nucleating protein: gamma-tubulin. gamma-TuSC is a heterotetramer with two copies of gamma-tubulin and one copy each of Spc98p and Spc97p. Previously, the structure of gamma-TuSC was determined by single particle electron microscopy (EM) at 25A resolution. gamma-TuSC is Y-shaped with a single flexible arm that could be the key to regulating MT nucleation. EM gold labeling revealed the locations of gamma-tubulin at the top of the Y. In vivo Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) suggested the relative orientations of Spc98p and Spc97p but did not distinguish which large subunit formed the flexible arm. Here, using fluorescent proteins as covalently attached tags, we used class averages and 3-D random conical tilt reconstructions to confirm the in vivo FRET results, clearly demonstrating that the Spc98p/97p C-termini interact directly with gamma-tubulin. Most significantly we have determined that the flexible arm belongs to Spc98p and our data also suggests that the N-termini of Spc98p and Spc97p are crossed. More generally, our results confirm that despite their small size, covalently-attached fluorescent proteins perform well as subunit labels in single particle EM.",M1
19706468,"Structure-neurotoxicity relationships of amyloid beta-protein oligomers.Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers may be the proximate neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Oligomer  is an ill-defined term because many kinds have been reported and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and higher-order assemblies. We report here results of studies in which specific oligomers have been stabilized structurally, fractionated in pure form, and then studied by using a combination of CD spectroscopy, Thioflavin T fluorescence, <e>EM</e>, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and neurotoxicity assays. Abeta monomers were largely unstructured, but oligomers exhibited order-dependent increases in beta-sheet content. EM and AFM data suggest that dimerization and subsequent monomer addition are processes in which significant and asymmetric monomer conformational changes occur. Oligomer secondary structure and order correlated directly with fibril nucleation activity. Neurotoxic activity increased disproportionately (order dependence &gt;1) with oligomer order. The structure-activity correlations reported here significantly extend our understanding of the conformational dynamics, structure, and relative toxicity of pure Abeta oligomers of specific order.",M1
19686663,"DNA deformations near charged surfaces: electron and atomic force microscopy views.DNA is a very important cell structural element, which determines the level of expression of genes by virtue of its interaction with regulatory proteins. We use electron (<e>EM</e>) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the flexibility of double-stranded DNA ( approximately 150-950 nm long) close to a charged surface. Automated procedures for the extraction of DNA contours ( approximately 10-120 nm for EM data and approximately 10-300 nm for AFM data) combined with new statistical chain descriptors indicate a uniquely two-dimensional equilibration of the molecules on the substrate surface regardless of the procedure of molecule mounting. However, in contrast to AFM, the EM mounting leads to a noticeable decrease in DNA persistence length together with decreased kurtosis. Analysis of local bending on short length scales (down to 6 nm in the EM study) shows that DNA flexibility behaves as predicted by the wormlike chain model. We therefore argue that adhesion of DNA to a charged surface may lead to additional static bending (kinking) of approximately 5 degrees per dinucleotide step without impairing the dynamic behavior of the DNA backbone. Implications of this finding are discussed.",M1
19685324,"Electron microscopic immunogold localization of recombination-related proteins in spreads of synaptonemal complexes from tomato microsporocytes.Many of the structures involved in meiotic synapsis and recombination such as synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and recombination nodules (RNs) can be resolved only by electron microscopy. Therefore, electron microscopic (<e>EM</e>) immunolocalization using gold-conjugated antibodies is the best way to verify whether certain proteins are components of SCs or RNs. Here, we describe (1) preparing tomato primary microsporocyte protoplasts in leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene stages; (2) hypotonically bursting the protoplasts on glow-discharged glass and plastic-coated slides to make spreads of SCs; (3) immunolabeling proteins in SCs and RNs with colloidal gold; (4) staining SC spreads for EM; and (5) transferring SC spreads on plastic films to grids for EM.",M1
19665524,"Subcellular distribution of L-type calcium channel subtypes in rat hippocampal neurons.L-type calcium channels play an essential role in synaptic activity-dependent gene expression and are implicated in long-term alterations in synaptic efficacy underlying learning and memory in the hippocampus. The two principal pore-forming subunits of L-type Ca2+ channels expressed in neurons are the Ca(v)1.2 (alpha(1C)) or Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) subtypes. Experimental evidence suggests that calcium entry through Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels occurs in close proximity to key signalling molecules responsible for triggering signalling pathways leading to transcriptional responses. Determining the subcellular distribution of Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-type channels in neurons is clearly important for unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term alterations in neuronal function. In this study, we used immunogold-labelling techniques and electron-microscopy (<e>EM</e>) to analyse the subcellular distribution and density of both Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in vivo. We confirm that both Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channel subtypes are predominantly but not exclusively located in postsynaptic dendritic processes and somata. Both Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 are distributed throughout the dendritic tree. However, the smallest (distal) dendritic processes and spines have proportionally more calcium channels inserted into their plasma membrane than located within cytoplasmic compartments indicating the potential targeting of calcium channels to microdomains within neurons. Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels are located at the postsynaptic density and also at extra-synaptic sites. The location of L-type Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channels in distal dendrites and spines would thus place them at appropriate sites where they could initiate synapse to nucleus signalling.",M1
19660566,"Studying intracellular transport using high-pressure freezing and Correlative Light Electron Microscopy.Correlative Light Electron Microscopy (CLEM) aims at combining the best of light and electron microscopy in one experiment. Light microscopy (LM) is especially suited for providing a general overview with data from lots of different cells and by using live cell imaging it can show the history or sequence of events between or inside cells. Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) on the other hand can provide a much higher resolution image of a particular event and provide additional spatial information, the so-called reference space. CLEM thus has certain strengths over the application of both LM and EM techniques separately. But combining both modalities however generally also means making compromises in one or both of the techniques. Most often the preservation of ultrastructure for the electron microscopy part is sacrificed. Ideally samples should be visualized in its most native state both in the light microscope as well as the electron microscope. For electron microscopy this currently means that the sample will have to be cryo-fixed instead of the standard chemical fixation. In this paper we will discuss the rationale for using cryofixation for CLEM experiments. In particular we will highlight a CLEM technique using high-pressure freezing in combination with live cell imaging. In addition we examine some of the EM analysis tools that may be useful in combination with CLEM techniques.",M1
19654103,"Advanced correlative light/electron microscopy: current methods and new developments using Tokuyasu cryosections.Microscopy is an essential tool for analysis of cellular structures and function. With the advent of new fluorescent probes and super-resolution light microscopy techniques, the study of dynamic processes in living cells has been greatly facilitated. Fluorescence light microscopy provides analytical, quantitative, and three-dimensional (3D) data with emphasis on analysis of live cells using fluorescent markers. Sample preparation is easy and relatively inexpensive, and the use of appropriate tags provides the ability to track specific proteins of interest. Of course, only electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) achieves the highest definition in terms of ultrastructure and protein labeling. To fill the gap between light microscopy and EM, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) strategies have been developed. In particular, hybrid techniques based upon immuno-EM provide sensitive protein detection combined with high-resolution information on cell structures and protein localization. By adding the third dimension to EM with electron tomography (ET) combined with rapid freezing, CLEM techniques now provide additional tools for quantitative 3D analysis. Here, we overview the major methods applied and highlight the latest advances in the field of CLEM. We then focus on two selected techniques that use cryosections as substrate for combined biomolecular imaging. Finally, we provide a perspective of future developments in the field.",M1

METHODS: The study was conducted at Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi over 12 years (1996-2008). All children (&lt;or=18 years) with INS in whom renal biopsy was performed were included. Renal biopsies were studied by LM, IF, and EM. RESULTS: Of 538 children, 347 (64.4%) were male and 191 (35.5%) were female. Mean age was 9.79 +/- 4.59 years. The histopathological lesions comprised: minimal change disease (MCD) and its variants, 43.8%; focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 38.14%; membranous glomerulonephritis (GN) (MGN), 7.96%; mesangioproliferative GN (MesPGN), 4.81%; mesangiocapillary GN (MPGN), 3.14%; IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 1.11%; and other rare lesions. CONCLUSION: MCD and its variants are the leading cause of overall INS in children, followed by FSGS, which is the predominant pathology in steroid-resistant and adolescent nephrotic syndrome (NS). Our data are in accordance with recent series from around the world with similar biopsy indications. The study defines the true pattern of glomerulopathies in childhood INS for the first time in Pakistan.",M1
19604479,"<e>EM</e>-fold: De novo folding of alpha-helical proteins guided by intermediate-resolution electron microscopy density maps.In medium-resolution (7-10 A) cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps, alpha helices can be identified as density rods whereas beta-strand or loop regions are not as easily discerned. We are proposing a computational protein structure prediction algorithm  EM-Fold  that resolves the density rod connectivity ambiguity by placing predicted alpha helices into the density rods and adding missing backbone coordinates in loop regions. In a benchmark of 11 mainly alpha-helical proteins of known structure a native-like model is identified in eight cases (rmsd 3.9-7.9 A). The three failures can be attributed to inaccuracies in the secondary structure prediction step that precedes EM-Fold. EM-Fold has been applied to the approximately 6 A resolution cryo-EM density map of protein IIIa from human adenovirus. We report the first topological model for the alpha-helical 400 residue N-terminal region of protein IIIa. EM-Fold also has the potential to interpret medium-resolution density maps in X-ray crystallography.",M1
19580754,"Characterization of antibiotic peptide pores using cryo-<e>EM</e> and comparison to neutron scattering.Magainin, a 23-residue antibiotic peptide, interacts directly with the lipid bilayer leading to cell lysis in a strongly concentration-dependent fashion. Utilizing cryo-electron microscopy, we have directly observed magainin interacting with synthetic DMPC/DMPG membranes. Visual examination shows that visibly unperturbed vesicles are often found adjacent to vesicles that are lysed or porous, demonstrating that magainin disruption is a highly stochastic process. Quantitatively, power spectra of large numbers of porous vesicles can be averaged together to produce the equivalent of an electron scattering curve, which can be related to theory, simulation, and published neutron scattering experiments. We demonstrate that magainin-induced pores in lipid vesicles have a mean diameter of approximately 80 A, compatible with earlier reported results in multilayer stacks. In addition to establishing a connection between experiments in multilayer stacks and vesicles, this also demonstrates that computed power spectra from windowed-out regions of cryo-EM images can be compared to neutron scattering data in a meaningful way, even though the pores of interest cannot yet be individually identified in images. Cryo-EM offers direct imaging of systems in configurations closely related to in vivo conditions, whereas neutron scattering has a greater variety of mechanisms for specific contrast variation via D2O and deuterated lipids. Combined, the two mechanisms support each other, and provide a clearer picture of such 'soft' systems than either could provide alone.",M1
19556969,"Unusual bipartite mode of interaction between the nonsense-mediated decay factors, UPF1 and UPF2.Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs carrying premature stop codons. In mammalian cells, NMD is triggered when UPF2 bound to UPF3 on a downstream exon junction complex interacts with UPF1 bound to a stalled ribosome. We report structural studies on the interaction between the C-terminal region of UPF2 and intact UPF1. Crystal structures, confirmed by <e>EM</e> and SAXS, show that the UPF1 CH-domain is docked onto its helicase domain in a fixed configuration. The C-terminal region of UPF2 is natively unfolded but binds through separated alpha-helical and beta-hairpin elements to the UPF1 CH-domain. The alpha-helical region binds sixfold more weakly than the beta-hairpin, whereas the combined elements bind 80-fold more tightly. Cellular assays show that NMD is severely affected by mutations disrupting the beta-hairpin binding, but not by those only affecting alpha-helix binding. We propose that the bipartite mode of UPF2 binding to UPF1 brings the ribosome and the EJC in close proximity by forming a tight complex after an initial weak encounter with either element.",M1
19507275,"Study on pretreatment of FPS-1 in rats with hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.This study was designed to determine whether FPS-1, the water-soluble polysaccharide isolated from fuzi, protected against hepatic damage in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and its mechanism. SD rats were subjected to 60 min of hepatic ischemia, followed by 120 min reperfusion. FPS-1 (160 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 5 days before ischemia-reperfusion injury in treatment group. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and albumin (ALB) were assayed to evaluate liver functions. Liver samples were taken for histological examination and determination of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), that catalase (CAT) in liver. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in mitochondria were measured with colorimetry method. Morphological changes were also investigated by using both light microscopy and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). In addition, apoptosis and oncosis were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI immunofluorescent flow cytometry analysis. Serum AST and ALT levels were elevated in groups exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (p &lt; 0.05). Ischemia-reperfusion caused a marked increase in MDA level, and significant decreases in hepatic SOD and CAT (p &lt; 0.05). Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase were reduced in ischemia-reperfusion groups compared to the sham group (p &lt; 0.05). Oncosis and apoptosis were also observed in ischemia-reperfusion groups. Pretreatment with FPS-1 reversed all these biochemical parameters as well as histological alterations, evidently by increased SOD, CAT, reduced MDA and histological scores compared to the model group (p &lt; 0.05). FPS-1 could attenuate the necrotic states by the detection of immunofluorescent flow cytometry analysis. Pretreatment with FPS-1 reduced hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury through its potent antioxidative effects and attenuation of necrotic states.",M1
19494830,"3D architecture of DNA Pol alpha reveals the functional core of multi-subunit replicative polymerases.Eukaryotic DNA replication requires the coordinated activity of the multi-subunit DNA polymerases: Pol alpha, Pol delta and Pol epsilon. The conserved catalytic and regulatory B subunits associate in a constitutive heterodimer that represents the functional core of all three replicative polymerases. Here, we combine X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) to describe subunit interaction and 3D architecture of heterodimeric yeast Pol alpha. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit bound to the B subunit illustrates a conserved mechanism of accessory factor recruitment by replicative polymerases. The EM reconstructions of Pol alpha reveal a bilobal shape with separate catalytic and regulatory modules. Docking of the B-CTD complex in the EM reconstruction shows that the B subunit is tethered to the polymerase domain through a structured but flexible linker. Our combined findings provide a structural template for the common functional architecture of the three major replicative DNA polymerases.",M1
19489732,"The advent of near-atomic resolution in single-particle electron microscopy.Single-particle electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) can provide structural information for a large variety of biological molecules, ranging from small proteins to large macromolecular assemblies, without the need to produce crystals. The year 2008 has become a landmark year for single-particle EM as for the first time density maps have been produced at a resolution that made it possible to trace protein backbones or even to build atomic models. In this review, we highlight some of the recent successes achieved by single-particle EM and describe the individual steps involved in producing a density map by this technique. We also discuss some of the remaining challenges and areas, in which further advances would have a great impact on the results that can be achieved by single-particle EM.",M1
19409513,"Conformational rearrangements upon Syk auto-phosphorylation.Syk is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is activated after recruitment to immune receptors, triggering the phopshorylation of downstream targets. The kinase activity of Syk is controlled by an auto-inhibited conformation consisting of a regulatory region that contains two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains inhibiting the catalytic activity of the kinase domain located at the C-terminus. The atomic structure of the related Zap-70 kinase and an electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) model of Syk have revealed the structural mechanism of this auto-inhibition based on the formation of a compact conformation sustained by interactions between the regulatory and catalytic domains. On the other hand, the structural basis of Syk activation is not fully understood due to the lack of a 3D structure of full-length Syk in an active conformation. Here, we have used single-particle electron microscopy to analyse the conformational changes taking place in an activated form of Syk induced by auto-phosphorylation. The conformation of phosphorylated Syk is reminiscent of the compact structure of the inhibited protein but significant conformational changes are observed in the regulatory region. These rearrangements could be sufficient to disrupt the inhibitory interactions, contributing to Syk activation. These results suggest that the regulation of the activation of Syk might be modulated by subtle changes in the positioning of the regulatory domains rather than a full opening mechanism as proposed for the Src kinases.",M1
19403600,"Revisiting synaptic vesicle pool localization in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.The synaptic vesicles are organized in distinct populations or 'pools': the readily releasable pool (the first vesicles released upon stimulation), the recycling pool (which maintains release under moderate stimulation) and the reserve pool (which is called into action only upon strong, often unphysiological stimulation). A major question in the field is whether the pools consist of biochemically different vesicles or whether the pool tag is a spatial one (with the recycling vesicles found next to the release sites, and the reserve ones farther away). A strong and stable spatial segregation has been proposed in the last decade in the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction--albeit based solely on light microscopy experiments. We have tested here this hypothesis using electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) photoconversion. We found the recycling and reserve pools to be thoroughly intermixed at the EM level, indicating that spatial location is irrelevant for the functional properties of the vesicle.",M1
19387067,"Stromal edema in klf4 conditional null mouse cornea is associated with altered collagen fibril organization and reduced proteoglycans.PURPOSE: Klf4, one of the highly expressed transcription factors in the mouse cornea, plays an important role in maturation and maintenance of the ocular surface. In this study, the structure and proteoglycan composition of the Klf4 conditional null (Klf4CN) corneal stroma was investigated, to further characterize the previously reported Klf4CN stromal edema. METHODS: Collagen fibril spacing and diameter were calculated from scattering intensity profiles from small angle synchrotron x-ray scattering patterns obtained across the cornea along a vertical meridian at 0.5-mm intervals. Collagen fibril organization and proteoglycans were visualized by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), with or without the cationic dye cuprolinic blue. Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans were further analyzed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) and immunoblot analysis. Q-RT-PCR was used to measure the transcript levels. RESULTS: In the central cornea, the average collagen interfibrillar Bragg spacing increased from 44.5 nm (SD +/-1.8) in wild-type to 66.5 nm (SD +/-2.3) in Klf4CN, as measured by x-ray scattering and confirmed by EM. Mean collagen fibril diameter increased from 32 nm (SD +/-0.4) in wild-type to 42.3 nm (SD +/-4.8) in Klf4CN corneal stroma. Downregulation of proteoglycans detected by EM in the Klf4CN stroma was confirmed by FACE and immunoblot analysis. Q-RT-PCR showed that, whereas the Klf4CN corneal proteoglycan transcript levels remained unchanged, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) transcript levels were significantly upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The Klf4CN corneal stromal edema is characterized by increased collagen interfibrillar spacing and increased diameter of individual fibrils. The stroma also exhibits reduced interfibrillar proteoglycans throughout, which is possibly caused by increased expression of MMPs.",M1
19376268,"Serial <e>EM</e> analysis of a copepod larval nervous system: Naupliar eye, optic circuitry, and prospects for full CNS reconstruction.The medial eye and optic center of the first nauplius of Dactylopusia (=Dactylopodia) tisboides, a harpacticoid copepod, were reconstructed from serial EM micrographs. Axons from the eye project to a set of matching cartridges defined by glial cells processes, and input is then processed in sequence through two synaptic fields. A single class of local relay neurons provides the main pathway between these, subject to modulatory input from a class of densely stained neurons with distinctive dense terminals. The importance of other outside sources of synaptic input to the second synaptic field indicates that the latter is a major site for integrating the optic input with signals originating elsewhere in the CNS. This accords with physiological data on the shadow response in barnacles, whose visual system is also derived from a naupliar eye. With a body length of ca. 80microns, copepod larvae like that of Dactylopusia are arguably among the smallest functional metazoans with a complex nervous system. Hence they are promising subjects for full reconstruction of neural circuitry at the EM level that could, in principle, reveal where key decision-making functions are localized.",M1
19362168,"Protection of bleomycin-induced fibrosis and inflammation by taurine.Taurine has been shown to protect against lung injury induced by various oxidants including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, amiodarone, and paraquat and to protect against bleomycin-induced lung injury in combination with niacin. In this study, Spraque-Dawley rats were treated with 5% taurine in the drinking water for 10 days prior to bleomycin instillation. Fibrosis in the rats pretreated with taurine (BT) was absent, along with fewer inflammatory infiltrates compared to the untreated rats (BW). A significant decrease in the number of PMNs and a decrease in hydroxyproline levels were found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the BT group compared to the BW group. By immunohistochemical staining, inducible nitric oxide synthase was evident in the lungs of bleomycin-treated rats, and minimal when rats were treated with taurine. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as measured by immunohistochemical staining, was present in lungs of both taurine-treated and untreated rats, but was more abundant in the BW group compared to the BT group. In addition, decreased ICAM presentation was detected by <e>EM</e> immunogold staining in the BT group compared to the BW group. These data demonstrate that rats pretreated with 5% taurine in their drinking water prior to bleomycin instillation are protected from fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, as well as nitric oxide and TNF-alpha production, which are hallmarks of bleomycin lung injury.",M1
19338777,"How calcium controls microtubule anisotropic phase formation in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins in vitro.Here we show a new effect of Ca2+ on microtubule morphology: Ca2+ can cause smooth curving of microtubules in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). In vitro, microtubules self-organize, forming complex dissipative structures. Such structures may be strongly affected by relatively weak external factors. A factor such as Ca2+ potentially influences spatiotemporal patterns of microtubule assembly, but the dynamics are unclear. We tested Ca2+ effects on microtubule formation. Using <e>EM</e>, microtubule length, curvature, and alignment and were measured in two systems: 2 mg/ml microtubule protein containing MAPs and 1 mM EGTA with and without 1 mM Ca2+. The two systems were then tested using light scattering. In low Ca2+, a birefringent microtubular pattern is seen, increasing with polymerization. When 1 mM Ca2+ is added to the solution, anisotropic phase is prevented without microtubule disruption. This demonstrates an additional mechanism by which Ca2+ can alter the dynamics and morphology of microtubules.",M1
19323808,"Of gastro and the gold standard: evaluation and policy implications of norovirus test performance for outbreak detection.BACKGROUND: The norovirus group (NVG) of caliciviruses are the etiological agents of most institutional outbreaks of gastroenteritis in North America and Europe. Identification of NVG is complicated by the non-culturable nature of this virus, and the absence of a diagnostic gold standard makes traditional evaluation of test characteristics problematic. METHODS: We evaluated 189 specimens derived from 440 acute gastroenteritis outbreaks investigated in Ontario in 2006-07. Parallel testing for NVG was performed with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT2-PCR), enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). Test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) were estimated using latent class models and composite reference standard methods. The practical implications of test characteristics were evaluated using binomial probability models. RESULTS: Latent class modelling estimated sensitivities of RT2-PCR, EIA, and EM as 100%, 86%, and 17% respectively; specificities were 84%, 92%, and 100%; estimates obtained using a composite reference standard were similar. If all specimens contained norovirus, RT2-PCR or EIA would be associated with &gt; 99.9% likelihood of at least one test being positive after three specimens tested. Testing of more than 5 true negative specimens with RT2-PCR would be associated with a greater than 50% likelihood of a false positive test. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the characterization of EM as lacking sensitivity for NVG outbreaks. The high sensitivity of RT2-PCR and EIA permit identification of NVG outbreaks with testing of limited numbers of clinical specimens. Given risks of false positive test results, it is reasonable to limit the number of specimens tested when RT2-PCR or EIA are available.",M1
19321153,"Analysis of dermal elastic fibers in the absence of fibulin-5 reveals potential roles for fibulin-5 in elastic fiber assembly.Fibulin-5 is a 66 kDa modular, extracellular matrix protein that localizes to elastic fibers. Although in vitro protein-protein binding studies have shown that fibulin-5 binds many proteins involved in elastic fiber formation, the specific role of fibulin-5 in elastogenesis remains unclear. To provide a more detailed analysis of elastic fiber assembly in the absence of fibulin-5, the dermis of wild-type and fibulin-5 gene knockout (Fbln5(-/-)) mice was examined with electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). Although light microscopy showed apparently normal elastic fibers near the hair follicles and the absence of elastic fibers in the intervening dermis of the Fbln5(-/-) mouse, EM revealed the presence of aberrantly assembled elastic fibers in both locales. Instead of the elastin being incorporated into the microfibrillar scaffold, the elastin appeared as globules juxtaposed to the microfibrils. Desmosine analysis showed significantly lower levels of mature cross-linked elastin in the Fbln5(-/-) dermis, however, gene expression levels for tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, the major elastic fiber components, were unaffected. Based on these results, the nature of tropoelastin cross-linking was investigated using domain specific antibodies to lysyl oxidase like-1 (LOXL-1). Immunolocalization with an antibody to the N-terminal pro-peptide, which is cleaved to generate the active enzyme, revealed abundant staining in the Fbln5(-/-) dermis and no staining in the wild-type dermis. Overall, these results suggest two previously unrecognized functions for fibulin-5 in elastogenesis; first, to limit the extent of aggregation of tropoelastin monomers and/or coacervates and aid in the incorporation of elastin into the microfibril bundles, and second, to potentially assist in the activation of LOXL-1.",M1
19287998,"A pilot study of vasculogenic mimicry immunohistochemical expression in intraocular melanoma model.Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) has been recognized as a new form of angiogenesis. However, some previous studies have demonstrated the absence of VM channel in a uveal melanoma xenograft mice model. This study investigated the pattern and distribution of microcirculation in an intraocular animal model. C57Bl/6 mice were randomly divided into 3 groups used for the blood supply models of malignant melanoma. The right eyes of the mice received subretinal injections with B16 melanoma cells and the left eyes were the control. One experimental group mice was randomly sacrificed at days 3, 7 and 14 to evaluate the tumor size and microcirculation by immunostaining with anti-CD34 antibodies, PAS staining and electronic microscopy (<e>EM</e>). Activated-carbon tracing was used to confirm whether the VM structure connected to the host blood circulation at day 14. We observed 3 types of microcirculation patterns in this model. The tracer was used to confirm whether VM structure connected to the host blood circulation. The distribution of VM and MV was not uniform and appeared in patches. As the area of tumor tissue expands, the number of endothelium increases and that of VM decreases. The number of endothelium-dependent vessels correlated with the tumor size (r=0.805, P=0.000), while the number of VM was inversely correlated (r=0.47, P=0.03). The EM results validated the presence of 3 patterns. In conclusion, VM along with endothelium-dependent vessels and MV sustained the blood supply. Tumor cells can obtain oxygen and nutriment through VM and MV besides endothelium-dependent vessels. VM may be a way to adapt to rapid tumor growth and invasiveness.",M1
19287128,"Cartilage collagen fibril network in newborn transgenic mice analyzed by electron microscopic stereology.The objective was to investigate by electron microscopic stereology the properties of the cartilage collagen fibril network in newborn transgenic mice. The mice harbored transgenes targeted to affect the structure or assembly of the collagen fibrils. The mouse lines investigated here harbored either (i) one or (ii) two human COL2A1 genes with Arg519Cys mutation in addition to one or (iii) no active allele(s) of the murine COL2A1 gene, (iv) two inactive alleles of the procollagen N-proteinase genes, or (v) a human COL2A1 gene with deleted exons 16-27. In all newborn mice carrying the COL2A1 transgene with Arg519Cys mutation, the growth plate collagen fibrils were thinner than in the wild-type (wt) mice and showed clearly reduced volume fraction of the fibril network. In mice with the inactive procollagen N-proteinase genes, the fibril thickness and the volume fraction of collagen did not differ from the wt mice. In mice harboring the transgene of human COL2A1 gene with internally deleted exons 16-27, the collagen fibril diameter remained the same, but the volume density of collagen network was reduced. Using the indirect stereology, the differences in the collagen fibril stereological estimates could be reliably detected in newborn mice harboring mutations that affect the structure and assembly of collagen fibrils. The <e>EM</e> stereology permitted early detection of altered phenotype of the collagen fibril network in newborn transgenic mice. It is recommended that the indirect model-based stereological technique is utilized instead of the direct design-based technique for the estimation of collagen volume, surface, and length densities.",M1
19265709,"Protofilament formation of ParM mutants.ParM, an actin homolog, forms left-handed two-start helical filaments that segregate DNA in bacteria prior to cell division. Our recent atomic model obtained from electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) reconstructions of negatively stained ParM filaments implied that two salt bridges (Glu35-Lys258 and Asp63-Arg262) may be key inter-filament contacts that stabilize the left-handed ParM helix. We made mutations of these amino acids and probed the inter-strand interface of our model experimentally by EM and X-ray fiber diffraction. We found that several mutations, such as ParM single mutants Asp258 and Asp262 and double mutant Asp258/Arg262, were incapable of forming straight filaments in aqueous buffers and appeared ragged and unstructured. However, in the presence of crowding agents, straight filaments or filament bundles formed, which allowed us to elucidate the structure of these mutant filaments. Centrifugation of filaments also resulted in a pellet of straightened filaments that could be oriented in glass capillaries and gave detailed X-ray diffraction patterns. Both EM and X-ray diffraction showed that filaments formed from these ParM mutants were not double-stranded helical filaments but single protofilaments, indicating that these residues are important for formation of the ParM helix. Our data also confirm a major prediction of crowding theory, namely that molecular crowding shifts the equilibrium of even severely impaired, unstructured cytoskeletal polymers toward their structured native and functional state. ParM is the first example of a helical actin homolog that can be induced to form protofilaments.",M1

19238134,"Microinjection of Xenopus laevis oocytes.Microinjection of Xenopus laevis oocytes followed by thin-sectioning electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) is an excellent system for studying nucleocytoplasmic transport. Because of its large nucleus and high density of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), nuclear transport can be easily visualized in the Xenopus oocyte. Much insight into the mechanisms of nuclear import and export has been gained through use of this system (reviewed by Panté, 2006). In addition, we have used microinjection of Xenopus oocytes to dissect the nuclear import pathways of several viruses that replicate in the host nucleus. Here we demonstrate the cytoplasmic microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with a nuclear import substrate. We also show preparation of the injected oocytes for visualization by thin-sectioning EM, including dissection, dehydration, and embedding of the oocytes into an epoxy embedding resin. Finally, we provide representative results for oocytes that have been microinjected with the capsid of the baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) or the parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), and discuss potential applications of the technique.",M1

Selection and accurate removal of introns is an essential step in gene expression that is performed by a large and highly dynamic macromolecular machine, called spliceosome. A major challenge for structural studies of the spliceosome is represented by its large size as well as its dynamic nature. Electron microscopy is an important technique to study the overall shape and architecture of spliceosomes and their components, and to locate subunits and RNA parts.

19187227,"Structure of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor extracellular domain in the unbound and hormone-bound states by single-particle electron microscopy.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plays a major role in blood pressure and volume regulation. ANP activities are mediated by a cell surface, single-span transmembrane receptor linked to its intrinsic guanylate cyclase activity. The crystal structures of the dimerized ANP receptor extracellular domain (ECD) with and without ANP have revealed a novel hormone-induced rotation mechanism occurring in the juxtamembrane region that appears to mediate signal transduction [Ogawa H, Qiu Y, Ogata CM &amp; Misono KS (2004) J Biol Chem 279, 28625-28631]. However, the ECD crystal packing contains two major intermolecular contacts that suggest two possible dimer pairs: 'head-to-head' (hh) and 'tail-to-tail' (tt) dimers associated via the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal subdomains, respectively. The existence of these two potential dimer forms challenges the proposed signaling mechanism. In this study, we performed single-particle electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) to determine the ECD dimer structures occurring in the absence of crystal contacts. EM reconstruction yielded the dimer structures with and without ANP in only the hh dimer forms. We further performed steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy of Trp residues, one of which (Trp74) occurs in the hh dimer interface and none of which occurs in the tt dimer interface. ANP binding caused a time-dependent decrease in Trp emission at 350 nm that was attributable to partially buried Trp74 in the unbound hh dimer interface becoming exposed to solvent water upon ANP binding. Thus, the results of single-particle EM and Trp fluorescence studies have provided direct evidence for hh dimer structures for unbound and ANP-bound receptor. The results also support the proposed rotation mechanism for transmembrane signaling by the ANP receptor.",M1

19175136,"An <e>EM</e> approach to MAP solution of segmenting tissue mixture percentages with application to CT-based virtual colonoscopy.Electronic colon cleansing (ECC) is an emerging technique developed to segment the colon lumen from a patient's abdominal computed tomography colonography (CTC) images. However, the residue stool and fluid tagged by contrast materials as well as mixed tissue distribution with partial volume (PV) effect impose several challenges for ECC, resulting in incomplete and overcomplete cleansings. To address the PV effect, this work investigated an improved maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) image segmentation algorithm which simultaneously estimates tissue mixture percentages within each image voxel and statistical model parameters for the tissue distribution. Given the segmented tissue mixture information beyond the image voxel level, not only the PV effect has been satisfactorily addressed as a particular case of tissue mixture problem, but incomplete and overcomplete ECC causes could also be maximally avoided. For clinical application to CTC that involves several issues transferring from theoretical analysis to practical validation, an innovative initialization procedure and refined estimation strategy were proposed to build an ECC pipeline based on the MAP-EM segmentation. The pipeline was evaluated based on 52 patient CTC studies, downloaded from the website of the Virtual Colonoscopy Screening Resource Center, by two radiologists. A noticeable improvement over the authors' previous ECC pipeline was documented. Several typical cases were also presented to show visually the improved performance of the presented ECC pipeline.",M1
19174371,"Congruence between NOTCH3 mutations and GOM in 131 CADASIL patients.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary subcortical vascular dementia. It is caused by mutations in NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a large transmembrane receptor Notch3. The key pathological finding is the accumulation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM), which contains extracellular domains of Notch3, on degenerating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). GOM has been considered specifically diagnostic for CADASIL, but the reports on the sensitivity of detecting GOM in patients' skin biopsy have been contradictory. To solve this contradiction, we performed a retrospective investigation of 131 Finnish, Swedish and French CADASIL patients, who had been adequately examined for both NOTCH3 mutation and presence of GOM. The patients were examined according to the diagnostic practice in each country. NOTCH3 mutations were assessed by restriction enzyme analysis of specific mutations or by sequence analysis. Presence of GOM was examined by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) in skin biopsies. Biopsies of 26 mutation-negative relatives from CADASIL families served as the controls. GOM was detected in all 131 mutation positive patients. Altogether our patients had 34 different pathogenic mutations which included three novel point mutations (p.Cys67Ser, p.Cys251Tyr and p.Tyr1069Cys) and a novel duplication (p.Glu434_Leu436dup). The detection of GOM by EM in skin biopsies was a highly reliable diagnostic method: in this cohort the congruence between NOTCH3 mutations and presence of GOM was 100%. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, exact figure for sensitivity cannot be determined, but it would require a prospective study to exclude possible selection bias. The identification of a pathogenic NOTCH3 mutation is an indisputable evidence for CADASIL, but demonstration of GOM provides a cost-effective guide for estimating how far one should proceed with the extensive search for a new or an uncommon mutations among the presently known over 170 different NOTCH3 gene defects. The diagnostic skin biopsy should include the border zone between deep dermis and upper subcutis, where small arterial vessels of correct size are located. Detection of GOM requires technically adequate biopsies and distinction of true GOM from fallacious deposits. If GOM is not found in the first vessel or biopsy, other vessels or additional biopsies should be examined.",M1
19160663,"Lipid quantification and structure determination of nuclear envelope precursor membranes in the sea urchin.Nuclear envelope assembly is a fundamental cellular process normally taking place once in every cell cycle in eukaryotes. The timing of fusion of nuclear membrane precursors to form the complete double membrane surrounding the chromosomes is tightly controlled, but much remains unclear concerning its regulation. Small amounts of material available and the high background of irrelevant cellular membranes have limited detailed analysis. We have employed several sensitive and high-resolution techniques to analyze the nuclear membrane structure, composition, and dynamics using purified membrane fractions and a cell-free system that results in nuclear envelope formation. We discuss the application of cholesterol and phospholipid colorimetric assays, fluorescent filipin labeling, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry coupled to HPLC (HPLC-ESI/MS/MS), electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Colorimetric assays determine the amounts of inorganic phosphates from phospholipids and cholesterol/ cholesteryl esters present in membrane-containing fractions. Filipin staining of natural membranes allows the localization and relative quantification of cholesterol. HPLC-ESI/MS/MS determines the quantitative composition of membrane phospholipid species from small amounts of membranes. Cryosectioning of cryoprotected sperm cells facilitates EM verification of membrane domains existing in vivo. Deuterium solid-state NMR provides information about membrane rigidity and lipid-phase behavior. The sensitivity, quantification, and structural determinations provided by these techniques should prove useful in studying membrane dynamics in a variety of systems exhibiting membrane fusion.",M1
19151726,"Conformational flexibility of metazoan fatty acid synthase enables catalysis.The metazoan cytosolic fatty acid synthase (FAS) contains all of the enzymes required for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis covalently linked around two reaction chambers. Although the three-dimensional architecture of FAS has been mostly defined, it is unclear how reaction intermediates can transfer between distant catalytic domains. Using single-particle <e>EM</e>, we have identified a near continuum of conformations consistent with a remarkable flexibility of FAS. The distribution of conformations was influenced by the presence of substrates and altered by different catalytic mutations, suggesting a direct correlation between conformation and specific enzymatic activities. We interpreted three-dimensional reconstructions by docking high-resolution structures of individual domains, and they show that the substrate-loading and condensation domains dramatically swing and swivel to access substrates within either reaction chamber. Concomitant rearrangement of the beta-carbon-processing domains synchronizes acyl chain reduction in one chamber with acyl chain elongation in the other.",M1
19144372,"Adeno-associated virus-2 and its primary cellular receptor--Cryo-<e>EM</e> structure of a heparin complex.Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV-2) is a leading candidate vector for gene therapy. Cell entry starts with attachment to a primary receptor, Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan (HSPG) before binding to a co-receptor. Here, cryo-electron microscopy provides direct visualization of the virus-HSPG interactions. Single particle analysis was performed on AAV-2 complexed with a 17 kDa heparin fragment at 8.3 A resolution. Heparin density covers the shoulder of spikes surrounding viral 3-fold symmetry axes. Previously implicated, positively charged residues R(448/585), R(451/588) and R(350/487) from another subunit cluster at the center of the heparin footprint. The footprint is much more extensive than apparent through mutagenesis, including R(347/484), K(395/532) and K(390/527) that are more conserved, but whose roles have been controversial. It also includes much of a region proposed as a co-receptor site, because prior studies had not revealed heparin interactions. Heparin density bridges over the viral 3-fold axes, indicating multi-valent attachment to symmetry-related binding sites.",M1
19132600,"From form to function: the ways to know a neuron.The shape of a neuron, its morphological signature, dictates the neuron's function by establishing its synaptic partnerships. Here, we review various anatomical methods used to reveal neuron shape and the contributions these have made to our current understanding of neural function in the Drosophila brain, especially the optic lobe. These methods, including Golgi impregnation, genetic reporters, and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), necessarily incorporate biases of various sorts that are easy to overlook, but that filter the morphological signatures we see. Nonetheless, the application of these methods to the optic lobe has led to reassuringly congruent findings on the number and shapes of neurons and their connection patterns, indicating that morphological classes are actually genetic classes. Genetic methods using, especially, GAL4 drivers and associated reporters have largely superceded classical Golgi methods for cellular analyses and, moreover, allow the manipulation of neuronal activity, thus enabling us to establish a bridge between morphological studies and functional ones. While serial-EM reconstruction remains the only reliable, albeit labor-intensive, method to determine actual synaptic connections, genetic approaches in combination with EM or high-resolution light microscopic techniques are promising methods for the rapid determination of synaptic circuit function.",M1
20409779,"Electron microscopic imaging and analysis of isolated dynein particles.Despite more than 40 years of investigation since the discovery of dynein [Gibbons, I. R. and Rowe, A. J. (1965). Science149, 424-426] our understanding of how this microtubule-based motor generates force and movement remains frustratingly incomplete at the atomic level. Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) has played a major role in establishing dynein's complex architecture and its nucleotide-dependent conformational changes. In this chapter we review recent structural studies and describe in detail negative stain EM and computational single-particle image processing techniques that have been used to investigate dynein. We describe studies of both Chlamydomonas flagellar inner arm dynein-c and recombinant cytoplasmic dynein from Dictyostelium. We also detail methods for locating green fluorescent protein (GFP) and blue fluorescent protein (BFP) tags inserted at specific locations within the dynein motor, which can be used to map subdomains and conformational changes.",M1
19111664,"Structure of a complete integrin ectodomain in a physiologic resting state and activation and deactivation by applied forces.The complete ectodomain of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) reveals a bent, closed, low-affinity conformation, the beta knee, and a mechanism for linking cytoskeleton attachment to high affinity for ligand. Ca and Mg ions in the recognition site, including the synergistic metal ion binding site (SyMBS), are loaded prior to ligand binding. Electrophilicity of the ligand-binding Mg ion is increased in the open conformation. The beta(3) knee passes between the beta(3)-PSI and alpha(IIb)-knob to bury the lower beta leg in a cleft, from which it is released for extension. Different integrin molecules in crystals and <e>EM</e> reveal breathing that appears on pathway to extension. Tensile force applied to the extended ligand-receptor complex stabilizes the closed, low-affinity conformation. By contrast, an additional lateral force applied to the beta subunit to mimic attachment to moving actin filaments stabilizes the open, high-affinity conformation. This mechanism propagates allostery over long distances and couples cytoskeleton attachment of integrins to their high-affinity state.",M1
19094971,"Effects of osmolality on PLP-null myelin structure: implications re axon damage.In order to test the adhesiveness of PLP-null compact myelin lamellae we soaked aldehyde-fixed CNS specimens from PLP-null and control mice overnight in distilled water, in Ringer's solution or in Ringer's solution with added 1 M sucrose. Subsequent examination of the tissue by <e>EM</e> showed that both PLP-null and control white matter soaked in Ringer remained largely compact. After the distilled water soak, control myelin was virtually unchanged, but PLP-null myelin showed some decompaction, i.e., separation of myelin lamellae from one another. After the sucrose/Ringer soak, normal myelin developed foci of decompaction, but the great majority of lamellae remained compact. In the PLP-null specimens, in contrast, many of the myelin sheaths became almost completely decompacted. Such sheaths became thicker overall and were comprised of lamellae widely separated from one another by irregular spaces. Thus, in normal animals, fixed CNS myelin lamellae are firmly adherent and resist separation; PLP-null myelin lamellae, in contrast, are poorly adherent and more readily separated. Mechanisms by which impaired adhesiveness of PLP-null myelin lamellae and fluctuations in osmolality in vivo might underlie slowing of conduction and axon damage are discussed.",M1
19043587,"Tubulin dimers oligomerize before their incorporation into microtubules.In the presence of GTP, purified dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin will interact longitudinally and laterally to self-assemble into microtubules (MTs). This property provides a powerful in vitro experimental system to describe MT dynamic behavior at the micrometer scale and to study effects and functioning of a large variety of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). Despite the plethora of such data produced, the molecular mechanisms of MT assembly remain disputed. Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) studies suggested that tubulin dimers interact longitudinally to form short oligomers which form a tube by lateral interaction and which contribute to MT elongation. This idea is however challenged: Based on estimated association constants it was proposed that single dimers represent the major fraction of free tubulin. This view was recently supported by measurements suggesting that MTs elongate by addition of single tubulin dimers. To solve this discrepancy, we performed a direct measurement of the longitudinal interaction energy for tubulin dimers. We quantified the size distribution of tubulin oligomers using EM and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). From the distribution we derived the longitudinal interaction energy in the presence of GDP and the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GMPCPP. Our data suggest that MT elongation and nucleation involves interactions of short tubulin oligomers rather than dimers. Our approach provides a solid experimental framework to better understand the role of MAPs in MT nucleation and growth.",M1
19002240,"Correlative and dynamic imaging of the hatching biology of Schistosoma japonicum from eggs prepared by high pressure freezing.BACKGROUND: Schistosome eggs must traverse tissues of the intestine or bladder to escape the human host and further the life cycle. Escape from host tissues is facilitated by secretion of immuno-reactive molecules by eggs and the formation of an intense strong granulomatous response by the host which acts to exclude the egg into gut or bladder lumens. Schistosome eggs hatch on contact with freshwater, but the mechanisms of activation and hatching are poorly understood. In view of the lack of knowledge of the behaviour of egg hatching in schistosomes, we undertook a detailed dynamic and correlative study of the hatching biology of Schistosoma japonicum. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hatching eggs of S. japonicum were studied using correlative light and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). The hatching behaviour was recorded by video microscopy. EM preparative methods incorporating high pressure freezing and cryo-substitution were used to investigate ultrastructural features of the miracidium and extra-embryonic envelopes in pre-activated and activated eggs, and immediately after eggshell rupture. Lectin cytochemistry was performed on egg tissues to investigate subcellular location of specific carbohydrate groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The hatching of S. japonicum eggs is a striking phenomenon, whereby the larva is liberated explosively while still encapsulated within its sub-shell envelopes. The major alterations that occur in the egg during activation are scission of the outer envelope-eggshell boundary, autolysis of the cellular inner envelope, and likely hydration of abundant complex and simple polysaccharides in the lacunal space between the miracidial larva and surrounding envelopes. These observations on hatching provide insight into the dynamic activity of the eggs and the biology of schistosomes within the host.",M1
18989044,"Computational approaches for automatic structural analysis of large biomolecular complexes.We present computational solutions to two problems of macromolecular structure interpretation from reconstructed three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-<e>EM</e>) maps of large bio-molecular complexes at intermediate resolution (5A-15 A). The two problems addressed are: 1) 3D structural alignment (matching) between identified and segmented 3D maps of structure units (e.g. trimeric configuration of proteins), and 2) the secondary structure identification of a segmented protein 3D map (i.e.locations of alpha-helices, beta-sheets). For problem 1, we present an efficient algorithm to correlate spatially (and structurally) two 3D maps of structure units. Besides providing a similarity score between structure units, the algorithm yields an effective technique for resolution refinement of repeated structure units, by 3D alignment and averaging. For problem 2, we present an efficient algorithm to compute eigenvalues and link eigenvectors of a Gaussian convoluted structure tensor derived from the protein 3D Map, thereby identifying and locating secondary structural motifs of proteins. The efficiency and performance of our approach is demonstrated on several experimentally reconstructed 3D maps of virus capsid shells from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), as well as computationally simulated protein structure density 3D maps generated from protein model entries in the Protein Data Bank.",M1
18953335,"Localization of Prp8, Brr2, Snu114 and U4/U6 proteins in the yeast tri-snRNP by electron microscopy.The U4/U6-U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is a major, evolutionarily highly conserved spliceosome subunit. Unwinding of its U4/U6 snRNA duplex is a central event of spliceosome activation that requires several components of the U5 portion of the tri-snRNP, including the RNA helicase Brr2, Prp8 and the GTPase Snu114. Here we report the <e>EM</e> projection structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tri-snRNP. It shows a modular organization comprising three extruding domains that contact one another in its central portion. We have visualized genetically tagged tri-snRNP proteins by EM and show here that U4/U6 snRNP forms a domain termed the arm. Conversely, a separate head domain adjacent to the arm harbors Brr2, whereas Prp8 and the GTPase Snu114 are located centrally. The head and arm adopt variable relative positions. This molecular organization and dynamics suggest possible scenarios for structural events during catalytic activation.",M1
18947334,"Astrocytes are more resistant to focal cerebral ischemia than neurons and die by a delayed necrosis.Several recent reports proposed that astrocyte death might precede neuronal demise after focal ischemia, contrary to the conventional view that astrocytes are more resistant to injury than neurons. Interestingly, there are findings supporting each of these opposing views. To clarify these controversies, we assessed astrocyte viability after 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. In contrast to neighboring neurons, astrocytes were alive and contained glycogen across the ischemic area 6 h after reperfusion, and at the expanding outer border of the infarct at later time points. These glycogen-positive astrocytes had intact plasma membranes. Astrocytes lost plasmalemma integrity much later than neurons: 19 +/- 22 (mean +/- standard deviation), 58 +/- 14 and 69 +/- 3% of astrocytes in the perifocal region became permeable to propidium iodide (PI) at 6, 24, 72 h after ischemia, respectively, in contrast to 81 +/- 2, 96 +/- 3, 97 +/- 2% of neurons. Although more astrocytes in the cortical and subcortical core regions were PI-positive, their numbers were considerably less than those of neurons. Lysosomal rupture (monitored by deoxyribonuclease II immunoreactivity) followed a similar time course. Cytochrome-c immunohistochemistry showed that astrocytes maintained mitochondrial integrity longer than neurons. <e>EM</e> confirmed that astrocyte ultrastructure including mitochondria and lysosomes disintegrated much later than that of neurons. We also found that astrocytes died by a delayed necrosis without significantly activating apoptotic mechanisms although they rapidly swelled at the onset of ischemia.",M1
18937496,"Location of subunit d in the peripheral stalk of the ATP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.ATP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an approximately 600 kDa membrane protein complex. The enzyme couples the proton motive force across the mitochondrial inner membrane to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The peripheral stalk subcomplex acts as a stator, preventing the rotation of the soluble F 1 region relative to the membrane-bound F O region during ATP synthesis. Component subunits of the peripheral stalk are Atp5p (OSCP), Atp4p (subunit b), Atp7p (subunit d), and Atp14p (subunit h). X-ray crystallography has defined the structure of a large fragment of the bovine peripheral stalk, including 75% of subunit d (residues 3-123). Docking the peripheral stalk structure into a cryo-<e>EM</e> map of intact yeast ATP synthase showed that residue 123 of subunit d lies close to the bottom edge of F 1. The 37 missing C-terminal residues are predicted to either fold back toward the apex of F 1 or extend toward the membrane. To locate the C terminus of subunit d within the peripheral stalk of ATP synthase from S. cerevisiae, a biotinylation signal was fused to the protein. The biotin acceptor domain became biotinylated in vivo and was subsequently labeled with avidin in vitro. Electron microscopy of the avidin-labeled complex showed the label tethered close to the membrane surface. We propose that the C-terminal region of subunit d spans the gap from F 1 to F O, reinforcing this section of the peripheral stalk.",M1
18928504,"Kinesin-3 is an organelle motor in the squid giant axon.Conventional kinesin (Kinesin-1), the founding member of the kinesin family, was discovered in the squid giant axon, where it is thought to move organelles on microtubules. In this study, we identify a second squid kinesin by searching an expressed sequence tag database derived from the ganglia that give rise to the axon. The full-length open reading frame encodes a 1753 amino acid sequence that classifies this protein as a Kinesin-3. Immunoblots demonstrate that this kinesin, unlike Kinesin-1, is highly enriched in chaotropically stripped axoplasmic organelles, and immunogold electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) demonstrates that Kinesin-3 is tightly bound to the surfaces of these organelles. Video microscopy shows that movements of purified organelles on microtubules are blocked, but organelles remain attached, in the presence Kinesin-3 antibody. Immunogold EM of axoplasmic spreads with antibody to Kinesin-3 decorates discrete sites on many, but not all, free organelles and localizes Kinesin-3 to organelle/microtubule interfaces. In contrast, label for Kinesin-1 decorates microtubules but not organelles. The presence of Kinesin-3 on purified organelles, the ability of an antibody to block their movements along microtubules, the tight association of Kinesin-3 with motile organelles and its distribution at the interface between native organelles and microtubules suggest that Kinesin-3 is a dominant motor in the axon for unidirectional movement of organelles along microtubules.",M1
18839064,"A case of systemic lupus erythematosus showing invagination of the podocyte into the glomerular basement membrane: an electron microscopic observation of a repeated-renal biopsy.A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showing invagination of glomerular epithelial cells into the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) has been reported. The patient was a 30-year-old woman who was diagnosed with SLE at the age of 25 and had been medicated with corticosteroid. At the age of 30, she was re-admitted into our hospital because of the relapse of lupus nephritis. Renal biopsy was performed twice: at the onset of SLE and the second admission. Morphologically, the results of the first and second renal biopsies were compatible with the classification of lupus nephritis class II. Immunofluorescent study revealed the mesangial deposition of IgG, IgA, C1q, C3 and membrane attack complex (MAC) in two renal biopsies. Especially, in the second renal biopsy, numerous vesicular structures composed of a unit membrane going into the epithelial site of the GBM were observed by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), but not in the first renal biopsy. Moreover, observations of serial sections of EM suggested that these vesicular structures were invaginated into the GBM and derived from a part of the podocytes.",M1
18831713,"Isolation at physiological temperature of detergent-resistant membranes with properties expected of lipid rafts: the influence of buffer composition.The failure of most non-ionic detergents to release patches of DRM (detergent-resistant membrane) at 37 degrees C undermines the claim that DRMs consist of lipid nanodomains that exist in an L(o) (liquid ordered) phase on the living cell surface. In the present study, we have shown that inclusion of cations (Mg(2+), K(+)) to mimic the intracellular environment stabilizes membranes during solubilization sufficiently to allow the isolation of DRMs at 37 degrees C, using either Triton X-100 or Brij 96. These DRMs are sensitive to chelation of cholesterol, maintain outside-out orientation of membrane glycoproteins, have prolonged (18 h) stability at 37 degrees C, and are vesicles or sheets up to 150-200 nm diameter. DRMs containing GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins PrP (prion protein) and Thy-1 can be separated by immunoaffinity isolation, in keeping with their separate organization and trafficking on the neuronal surface. Thy-1, but not PrP, DRMs are associated with actin. <e>EM</e> (electron microscopy) immunohistochemistry shows most PrP, and some Thy-1, to be clustered on DRMs, again maintaining their organization on the neuronal surface. For DRMs labelled for either protein, the bulk of the surface of the DRM is not labelled, indicating that the GPI-anchored protein is a minor component of its lipid domain. These 37 degrees C DRMs thus have properties expected of raft membrane, yet pose more questions about how proteins are organized within these nanodomains.",M1
18824234,"Single particle <e>EM</e> studies of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex and evidence for DNA wrapping.Hyperphosphorylation of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex (DmORC) by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) allows nucleotide binding but inhibits the ATPase activity of Orc1, and ablates the ATP-dependent interaction of ORC with DNA. Here we present single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies of ORC bound to nucleotide in both the dephosphorylated and hyper-phosphorylated states. 3D image reconstructions show that nucleotide binding gives rise to an analogous conformation independent of phosphorylation state. At the intermediate resolution achieved in our studies, ATP promotes changes along the toroidal core of the complex with negligible differences contributed by phosphorylation. Thus, hyperphosphorylation of DmORC does not induce meso-scale rearrangement of the ORC structure. To better understand ORC's role in origin remodeling, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies that show the contour length of a 688bp linear DNA fragment shortens by the equivalent of approximately 130bp upon ORC binding. This data, coupled with previous studies that showed a linking number change in circular DNA upon ORC binding, suggests that ORC may wrap the DNA in a manner akin to DnaA. Based on existing data and our structures, we propose a subunit arrangement for the AAA+ and winged helix domains, and in addition, speculate on a path of the 133bp of DNA around the ORC complex.",M1
18819103,"Structural heterogeneity and protein composition of exosome-like vesicles (prostasomes) in human semen.BACKGROUND: Human seminal fluid contains small exosome-like vesicles called prostasomes. Prostasomes have been reported previously to play an important role in the process of fertilization by boosting survivability and motility of spermatozoa, in addition to modulating acrosomal reactivity. Prostasomes have also been reported to present with sizes varying from 50 to 500 nm and to have multilayered lipid membranes; however, the fine morphology of prostasomes has never been studied in detail. METHODS: Sucrose gradient-purified prostasomes were visualized by cryo-electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). Protein composition was studied by trypsin in-gel digestion and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Here we report for the first time the detailed structure of seminal prostasomes by cryo-EM. There are at least three distinct dominant structural types of vesicles present. In parallel with the structural analysis, we have carried out a detailed proteomic analysis of prostasomes, which led to the identification of 440 proteins. This is nearly triple the number of proteins identified to date for these unique particles and a number of the proteins identified previously were cross-validated in our study. CONCLUSION: From the data reported herein, we hypothesize that the structural heterogeneity of the exosome-like particles in human semen reflects their functional diversity. Our detailed proteomic analysis provided a list of candidate proteins for future structural and functional studies.",M1
18807140,"Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic characterization of brush cells of the rat cecum.Brush cells (BCs) are relatively rare cells that are sparsely distributed throughout the mammalian digestive and respiratory systems. BCs have been identified in the rodent large intestine, but these cells have not been characterized by immunocytochemistry or electron microscopy. We previously demonstrated that rat bile duct BCs had strong immunoreactivity for six proteins that function in HCO(3)(-) secretion and thus assumed that BCs secrete NaHCO(3). It is well known that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secretes NaHCO(3), but it is not known whether BCs of the GI tract also express proteins related to HCO(3)(-) secretion. Thus, in the present study, using double immunostaining for cytokeratin 18, a specific marker for BCs, we investigated protein expression in BCs from the rodent GI tract. We show that BCs from the GI tract express six proteins related to HCO(3)(-) secretion: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger, Na(+)/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter, carbonic anhydrase II, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 1, and NHE3. These results suggest that BCs from the GI tract secrete NaHCO(3). In addition, we examined BCs from the rat cecum using electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). Transmission EM (TEM) showed that BCs have long microvilli, a well-developed tubulovesicular system, and an abundant cytoskeleton. Scanning EM revealed that BCs were scattered on the luminal surface of the cecum and had numerous long microvilli.",M1
18791208,"Cluster of cases of malignant schwannoma in cattle.Between 1998 and 2001, several cases of ataxia and paresis followed by recumbency and death were reported in cows from different farms in a restricted area of the Argentinian Patagonia. Five cases of this cluster were studied and a diagnosis of malignant schwannoma was established.

Attempts to isolate a viral agent from the tumours were unsuccessful but the epidemiological data and the em findings suggest a viral aetiology.",M1
18761725,"Identification of a novel, actin-rich structure, the actin nodule, in the early stages of platelet spreading.BACKGROUND: During platelet spreading, the actin cytoskeleton undergoes marked changes, forming filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibres. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel actin-rich structure, termed an actin nodule, which appears prior to lamellipodia and stress fibre formation. METHODS: Platelet spreading was monitored using human platelets and mouse GFP-actin platelets using real-time and end-point DIC, and fluorescent and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). RESULTS: We identified a small, novel actin structure, the actin nodule, in the early stages of adhesion and spreading, which we hypothesize to be a precursor of lamellipodia and stress fibres. Nodule formation shows an inverse correlation to Rho kinase and myosin-II activity, is independent of PI3-kinase, but dependent on Src kinase activity. Actin nodules contain multiple proteins, including Arp2/3, Fyn, Rac, and beta1- and beta3- integrins, but not Src. EM analysis revealed that actin filaments extend in all directions from the nodules. Actin nodules are present on multiple matrices, including fibrinogen, laminin and VWF + botrocetin. CONCLUSION: This work identifies a novel platelet actin structure, which we propose is a precursor to both lamellipodia and stress fibres and acts to drive platelet spreading.",M1
18753422,"Role of conformational change in the C-terminus of beta2-microglobulin in dialysis-related amyloidosis.BACKGROUND: Beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) has been identified as the precursor protein of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), which is a serious complication for haemodialysis (HD) patients. However, mechanisms underlying beta(2)m amyloid fibril formation remains to be elucidated. We previously demonstrated, in amyloid deposits from HD patients, a conformational isoform of beta(2)m with an unfolded C-terminus. However, no direct experiments have previously been performed to address whether unfolded beta(2)m in the C-terminus may be prone to form amyloid fibrils. METHODS: To evaluate roles of C-terminal amino acids in beta(2)m-induced amyloid formation, we generated six types of recombinant beta(2)m with amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal region. To investigate their conformational change and amyloidogenicity, we measured circular dichroism spectra, the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan and thioflavin-T (ThT) of the recombinant beta(2)m. To analyse morphological change of beta(2)m, we performed electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) on the samples with elevated ThT fluorescence intensity. We used ultrasonication to enhance beta(2)m destabilization of the protein. RESULTS: Beta(2)M Trp95Leu and Arg97Ala showed conformational changes and increased their amyloidgenicity compared with beta(2)m wild-type (WT). With ultrasonication, beta(2)m Trp95Leu and Arg97Ala generated more amyloid fibrils than did beta(2)m WT even in physiological solution. EM showed that beta(2)m formed amorphous debris containing typical amyloid fibrils at 24 hours, when ThT fluorescence intensity was three-fold lower than that at six hours. CONCLUSIONS: Conformational changes in the C-terminus of beta(2)m may play an important role in DRA and that ultrasonication is useful for analysis of beta(2)m amyloidogenesis.",M1

We have developed a toolbox for three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) in Amira, which is a commercial software package, used by many laboratories. Our toolbox integrates a number of established procedures specifically tailored for 3D EM. These include input-output, filtering, segmentation, visualization and ray-tracing functions, which can be accessed directly from a user-friendly pop-up menu. They allow performing denoising and segmentation tasks directly in Amira, without the need of other programs, and ultimately allow the visualization of the results at photo-realistic quality with ray-tracing. They also allow a direct interaction with the data, such that, e.g., sub-tomograms can be directly extracted, or segmentation areas can be interactively selected. The implemented functions are fast, reliable and intuitive, yielding a comprehensive package for visualization in EM.",M1
18685922,"Spectrum of glomerulonephritides in adults with nephrotic syndrome in Pakistan.BACKGROUND: There is currently little information in literature about the pattern of glomerulonephritides (GN) in adults with nephrotic syndrome in this part of the world, particularly that involving the use of immunofluorescence (IMF) and electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>). A few studies reported are based on light microscopic study alone and hence do not reflect the true pattern of GN underlying nephrotic syndrome. We carried out this study in the Department of Histopathology, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi, Pakistan to determine, for the first time, the true pattern of GN in adult nephrotic patients from Pakistan. SIUT is a tertiary care center for renal and urologic disease in Pakistan. The Histopathology Laboratory of SIUT is equipped with all the modalities, including EM, required for precise diagnosis of glomerular disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective clinicopathologic study involving retrieval of clinical and pathological data from a review of original renal biopsy reports of adult patients with nephrotic syndrome who presented at the adult nephrology clinic of SIUT from July 1996 till July 2006. Two cores of renal tissue were routinely obtained. One core was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for light microscopy; the other core was divided into two halves, for EM and the IMF study. RESULTS: A total of 316 adult patients were included. Of these, 201 (63.6%) were male and 115 (36.4%) were female. Mean age was 28.4 +/- 10.51 years with a range of 16-78 years. The spectrum of pathological lesions in the adult nephrotic population was wide and comprised focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (39.87%), followed by membranous GN (MGN) (26.58%), minimal change disease (MCD) (14.82%), mesangiocapillary GN (4.3%), mesangioproliferative GN (4.11%), post-infectious GN (2.84%), IgA nephropathy (2.53%), and other rare lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that FSGS is the single most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adult nephrotic patients, followed by MGN, and MCD. Our data are similar to those reported in recent series from the US. The study defines the pattern of glomerular disease in adult nephrotic patients for the first time in this region, because it is based on light microscopy, serology, IMF, and EM findings.",M1
18679614,"Preparation and quantification of pseudotyped retroviral vector.Retroviral vectors have been widely used for research and clinical trials in gene therapy because of their high transduction efficiency. Retroviruses interact with target cells through their surface molecules (i.e., envelope proteins) and cellular receptors, which limit the susceptibility of target cells to retroviral vectors. Murine leukemia retrovirus (MuLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) overcomes the species barrier and is more resistant to mechanical and biochemical inactivation. A cell line producing VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV vector can be established by transfecting 293T cells expressing Gag, Pol, and VSV-G (293 GPG cell line) with a retroviral vector plasmid. Transduction potency of the resulting VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV retroviral supernatant can be quantified by titration, electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>), and the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. These protocols provide methods to prepare and quantify a pseudotyped retroviral vector with high transduction rates for most types of target cells.",M1
18664125,"[Immunolocalization of ANP in mast cells of rat and human pericardium]It is known that many heart diseases are accompanied by a significant increase in the level of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis, in the pericardial fluid. Cellular sources of ANP in pericardial cavity remain uncertain. By <e>EM</e> immunocytochemistry, we have examined the presence and localization of ANP in rat and human pericardium. ANP-immunoreactive material was revealed in granules of mast cells (MCs) situated in connective tissue of the pericardium. MCs have an oval form and measure about 6.5 x 12.5 and 9.1 x 13.6 microm in the rat and human pericardium, respectively. Density of MC population makes up about 50 and 10 cells/mm2 in the rat and human pericardium, respectively. Our data suggest possible participation of the pericardial MCs in endocrine function of pericardium and in control of the ANP level in pericardial cavity.",M1
18661056,"Electron microscopic radioautographic study on mitochondrial DNA synthesis in adrenal cortical cells of developing and aging mice.In order to study the aging changes of intramitochondrial DNA synthesis of mouse adrenal cortical cells, eight groups of developing mice, each consisting of three individuals (total 24), from fetal day 19 to postnatal newborn at days 1, 3, 9, 14, to adult at months 1, 2, and 6, were injected with 3H-thymidine, sacrificed 1 h later, and the adrenal tissues were fixed and processed for electron microscopic (<e>EM</e>) radioautography. On EM radioautograms obtained from each animal, the number of mitochondria and the mitochondrial labeling index labeled with 3H-thymidine showing DNA synthesis in each adrenal cortical cell, in three zones, were counted and the results in respective developing groups were compared. From the results, it was demonstrated that the numbers of mitochondria in the three zones, the zona glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis, of mice at various ages increased from fetal day 19 to postnatal month 6 due to development and aging of animals, respectively, while the number of labeled mitochondria and the labeling index of intramitochondrial DNA syntheses incorporating 3H-thymidine increased from fetal day 19 to postnatal month 2, reaching the maxima, and decreased to month 6. It was shown that the activity of intramitochondrial DNA synthesis in the adrenal cortical cells in developing and aging mice changed due to aging.",M1
18655791,"The Affinity Grid: a pre-fabricated <e>EM</e> grid for monolayer purification.We have recently developed monolayer purification as a rapid and convenient technique to produce specimens of His-tagged proteins or macromolecular complexes for single-particle electron microscopy (EM) without biochemical purification. Here, we introduce the Affinity Grid, a pre-fabricated EM grid featuring a dried lipid monolayer that contains Ni-NTA lipids (lipids functionalized with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid group). The Affinity Grid, which can be stored for several months under ambient conditions, further simplifies and extends the use of monolayer purification. After characterizing the Affinity Grid, we used it to isolate, within minutes, ribosomal complexes from Escherichia coli cell extracts containing His-tagged rpl3, the human homolog of the E. coli 50 S subunit rplC. Ribosomal complexes with or without associated mRNA could be prepared depending on the way the sample was applied to the Affinity Grid . Vitrified Affinity Grid specimens could be used to calculate three-dimensional reconstructions of the 50 S ribosomal subunit as well as the 70 S ribosome and 30 S ribosomal subunit from images of the same sample. We established that Affinity Grids are stable for some time in the presence of glycerol and detergents, which allowed us to isolate His-tagged aquaporin-9 (AQP9) from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions of Sf9 insect cells. The Affinity Grid can thus be used to prepare single-particle EM specimens of soluble complexes and membrane proteins.",M1
18647841,"The architecture of the DNA replication origin recognition complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The origin recognition complex (ORC) is conserved in all eukaryotes. The six proteins of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC that form a stable complex bind to origins of DNA replication and recruit prereplicative complex (pre-RC) proteins, one of which is Cdc6. To further understand the function of ORC we recently determined by single-particle reconstruction of electron micrographs a low-resolution, 3D structure of S. cerevisiae ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex. In this article, the spatial arrangement of the ORC subunits within the ORC structure is described. In one approach, a maltose binding protein (MBP) was systematically fused to the N or the C termini of the five largest ORC subunits, one subunit at a time, generating 10 MBP-fused ORCs, and the MBP density was localized in the averaged, 2D <e>EM</e> images of the MBP-fused ORC particles. Determining the Orc1-5 structure and comparing it with the native ORC structure localized the Orc6 subunit near Orc2 and Orc3. Finally, subunit-subunit interactions were determined by immunoprecipitation of ORC subunits synthesized in vitro. Based on the derived ORC architecture and existing structures of archaeal Orc1-DNA structures, we propose a model for ORC and suggest how ORC interacts with origin DNA and Cdc6. The studies provide a basis for understanding the overall structure of the pre-RC.",M1
18638365,"Rift Valley fever virus structural proteins: expression, characterization and assembly of recombinant proteins.BACKGROUND: Studies on Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) infection process and morphogenesis have been hampered due to the biosafety conditions required to handle this virus, making alternative systems such as recombinant virus-like particles, that may facilitate understanding of these processes are highly desirable. In this report we present the expression and characterization of RVFV structural proteins N, Gn and Gc and demonstrate the efficient generation of RVFV virus-like particles (VLPs) using a baculovirus expression system. RESULTS: A recombinant baculovirus, expressing nucleocapsid (N) protein of RVFV at high level under the control of the polyhedrin promoter was generated. Gel filtration analysis indicated that expressed N protein could form complex multimers. Further, N protein complex when visualized by electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) exhibited particulate, nucleocapsid like-particles (NLPs). Subsequently, a single recombinant virus was generated that expressed the RVFV glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) together with the N protein using a dual baculovirus vector. Both the Gn and Gc glycoproteins were detected not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface of infected cells. Moreover, expression of the Gn/Gc in insect cells was able to induce cell-cell fusion after a low pH shift indicating the retention of their functional characteristics. In addition, assembly of these three structural proteins into VLPs was identified by purification of cells' supernatant through potassium tartrate-glycerol gradient centrifugation followed by EM analysis. The purified particles exhibited enveloped structures that were similar to the structures of the wild-type RVFV virion particle. In parallel, a second recombinant virus was constructed that expressed only Gc protein together with N protein. This dual recombinant virus also generated VLPs with clear spiky structures, but appeared to be more pleomorphic than the VLPs with both glycoproteins, suggesting that Gc and probably also Gn interacts with N protein complex independent of each other. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that baculovirus expression system has enormous potential to produce large amount of VLPs that may be used both for fundamental and applied research of RVFV.",M1
18630682,"[Morphological and functional characteristics of pancreatic islet beta cells in natural aging SD rats]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of aging on metabolic profile and the changes in morphology and secreting function of beta-cell. METHODS: SD rats with different ages (5-6, 11-12, 20-24 Mon.) were used in this experiment to detect fasting blood glucose, lipid profile and free fatty acids (FFA) as metabolic parameters. Islet population and beta-cell shape from different age groups were assessed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscope (<e>EM</e>), respectively. Moreover, isolated rat islets from different ages were purified and cultured with two culture medium containing 5. 6 mmol/L and 16.7 mmol/L glucose over 24 hours, respectively. The secreted levels of insulin at 2, 4, 6, 24 hours were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). RESULTS: (1) The significantly higher concentration of FFA was found in 11-12, 20-24 months groups (386.02+/-88.08; 349.43+/-93.47 vs. 263.93+/-68.77 mmol/L, respectively, P&lt;0.05), with no difference in WT, FBG, lipid profile among three groups; (2) Insulin secretion by glucose (5.5 mmol/L) stimulating old rats showed lower peak value than younger counterparts did [6.40+/-2.7 vs. 13.97+/-1.23 (6 Mon.) &amp; 12.08+/-0.76 (12 Mon.) mU/L x 30 islets] and so did another glucose (16.7 mmol/L) group [6.75+/-4.69 vs. 13.41+/-0.72 (6 Mon.) &amp; 13.56+/-0.60 (12 Mon.)]. (3) The ratio of beta-cell mass to islet was slightly larger in old rats than in younger rats (72.99+/-29.65% vs. 67.76+/-23.48% (12 Mon.) &amp; 61.69+/-30.12% (6 Mon.), P&gt;0.05); The expression of insulin measured by immunohistochemistry was dramatically decreased in old rat islet compared with 5-6, 11-12 month rats [242.71+/-95.37 (24 Mon.), 309+/-83.99 (12 Mon.) vs. 558+/-69.94 (6 Mon.), P&lt;0.05]. CONCLUSION: Older rats showed higher FFA and age-related impairment of insulin secretion with or without the glucose stimulation. These findings suggest that insulin therapy should be taken into account for elder earlier once type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.",M1
18617042,"Visualization of desmosomes in the electron microscope.Desmosomes are intercellular junctions found in epithelia and some other tissues. Their primary function is strong cell-cell adhesion. They also link the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeletons between cells and have roles in cell signaling, tissue morphogenesis, and wound repair. Because of their size (0.2-0.5 microm), details of their ultrastructure can only be resolved at the electron microscope (<e>EM</e>) level. Desmosomes have been visualized using a variety of ultrastructural techniques including lanthanum infiltration, freeze-fracture, electron tomography, cryo-electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. This chapter describes protocols for conventional transmission electron microscopy and for immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections. We also discuss the statistical analysis of immunogold particle distribution for low resolution molecular mapping.",M1
18617040,"Studying microtubules by electron microscopy.Microtubules are one of the three components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and play a central role in many aspects of cell function, including cell division and cell motility. Electron microscopy, of both isolated microtubules and of microtubules in their cellular context, is an essential tool in understanding their structure and function. These studies have been particularly important because the size and heterogeneity of microtubules mean that they are not readily studied by other structural methods. Electron microscopy at different levels of detail can bridge the gap between atomic resolution structures solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR, and the dynamic but relatively coarse information that is achieved in light microscopy experiments. This chapter provides an overview of current approaches to studying microtubules by electron microscopy. Negative stain studies can be relatively quick and easy, and provide a useful overview of microtubules and their interactions prior to undertaking more complicated experiments such as high resolution structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy or reconstruction of unique cellular entities by electron tomography. As more microtubule-associated proteins are uncovered, <e>EM</e> studies will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how these proteins influence microtubules and where in the cytoskeleton they act.",M1
18617029,"Combined video fluorescence and 3D electron microscopy.Three-dimensional structure of cells and organelles examined with the power of resolution of electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) including EM tomography represents the average view of cell processes. More precise and detailed analysis is limited by the significant variations in the structure of cells in temporal dynamics of cellular events. Therefore EM cannot identify rare and fast events that could be extremely important for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular processes. Observation of living cells under EM is still impossible. In contrast, observations of cellular dynamics with the help of laser scanning confocal microscopes or light digitalized microscopes became an indispensable tool of cell biology. However, the resolution of even confocal microscope is limited to the half of the light wave. Therefore, in studies of dynamic cellular processes, it would be ideal to be able to combine the capability of in vivo fluorescence video microscopy with the EM. This chapter describes this technique with details and useful tricks, including the way to localize the same cell after its transfection with a protein fused with a fluorescent tag, examination under the microscope in living condition, fixation, immunolabeling, embedding, serial sectioning from the first section, and observation under EM. We also illustrate here the kinds of questions that the CVLEM approach was designed to address, as well as the particular know-how that is important for the successful application of this technique.",M1
18586844,"Damped-dynamics flexible fitting.In fitting atomic structures into <e>EM</e> maps, it often happens that the map corresponds to a different conformation of the structure. We have developed a new methodology to handle these situations that preserves the covalent geometry of the structure and allows the modeling of large deformations. The first goal is achieved by working in generalized coordinates (positional and internal coordinates), and the second by avoiding harmonic potentials. Instead, we use dampers (shock absorbers) between every pair of atoms, combined with a force field that attracts the atomic structure toward incompletely occupied regions of the EM map. The trajectory obtained by integrating the resulting equations of motion converges to a conformation that, in our validation cases, was very close to the target atomic structure. Compared to current methods, our approach is more efficient and robust against wrong solutions and to overfitting, and does not require user intervention or subjective decisions. Applications to the computation of transition pathways between known conformers, homology and loop modeling, as well as protein docking, are also discussed.",M1
18581036,"Biophysical and ion channel functional characterization of the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in varying detergent-lipid environments.The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) of Torpedo electric rays has been extensively characterized over the last three decades. However, high-resolution structural studies have been hampered by the lack of mechanistic molecular models that describe how detergents influence membrane protein stability and function. Furthermore, elucidation of the dynamic detergent-lipid-protein interactions of solubilized membrane proteins is a largely unexplored research field. This study examines the effects of nine detergents on: (1) nAChR-lipid composition (gas chromatography with flame ionization; GC-FID and/or mass selective detectors; GC-MSD), (2) stability and aggregation state (analytical size exclusion chromatography; A-SEC and electron microscopy; <e>EM</e>) and (3) ion channel function (planar lipid bilayers). Detergent solubilization of nAChR-enriched membranes did not result in significant native lipid depletion or destabilization. Upon purification, native lipid depletion occurred in all detergents, with lipid-analogue detergents CHAPS {(3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate}, FC-12 (n-dodecylphosphocholine) and sodium cholate (3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic acid) maintaining stability and supporting ion channel function, and non-lipid-analogue detergents Cymal-6 (6-cyclohexyl-1-hexyl-beta-D-maltoside), DDM (n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside), LDAO (lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide) and OG (n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside) decreasing stability and significantly reducing or completely suppressing ion channel function. Anapoe-C(12)E(9 )(polyoxyethylene-[9]-dodecyl ether) and BigCHAP (N,N'-bis-[3-d-gluconamidopropyl] cholamide) retained residual amounts of native lipid, maintaining moderate stability and ion channel function compared to lipid-analogue detergents. Therefore, the nAChR can be stable and functional in lipid-analogue detergents or in detergents that retain moderate amounts of residual native lipids, but not in non-lipid-analogue detergents.",M1
18550837,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins: supramolecular organization of heterooligomers and the mechanism of filament assembly.Mitotic yeast cells express five septins (Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1/Sep7). Only Shs1 is nonessential. The four essential septins form a complex containing two copies of each, but their arrangement was not known. Single-particle analysis by <e>EM</e> confirmed that the heterooligomer is octameric and revealed that the subunits are arrayed in a linear rod. Identity of each subunit was determined by examining complexes lacking a given septin, by antibody decoration, and by fusion to marker proteins (GFP or maltose binding protein). The rod has the order Cdc11-Cdc12-Cdc3-Cdc10-Cdc10-Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11 and, hence, lacks polarity. At low ionic strength, rods assemble end-to-end to form filaments but not when Cdc11 is absent or its N terminus is altered. Filaments invariably pair into long parallel  railroad tracks.  Lateral association seems to be mediated by heterotetrameric coiled coils between the paired C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 projecting orthogonally from each filament. Shs1 may be able to replace Cdc11 at the end of the rod. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of cellular septin structures.",M1
18550658,"The envelope of intracellular African swine fever virus is composed of a single lipid bilayer.African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a member of a family of large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses that include poxviruses, iridoviruses, and phycodnaviruses. Previous ultrastructural studies of ASFV using chemical fixation and cryosectioning for electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) have produced uncertainty over whether the inner viral envelope is composed of a single or double lipid bilayer. In this study we prepared ASFV-infected cells for EM using chemical fixation, cryosectioning, and high-pressure freezing. The appearance of the intracellular viral envelope was determined and compared to that of mitochondrial membranes in each sample. The best resolution of membrane structure was obtained with samples prepared by high-pressure freezing, and images suggested that the envelope of ASFV consisted of a single lipid membrane. It was less easy to interpret virus structure in chemically fixed or cryosectioned material, and in the latter case the virus envelope could be interpreted as having two membranes. Comparison of membrane widths in all three preparations indicated that the intracellular viral envelope of ASFV was not significantly different from the outer mitochondrial membrane (P &lt; 0.05). The results support the hypothesis that the intracellular ASFV viral envelope is composed of a single lipid bilayer.",M1
18543127,"Baculovirus mediated production of infectious hepatitis C virus in human hepatoma cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase.Although much has been learned about Hepatitis C virus (HCV), research progress has been hindered by the lack of a suitable cell culture system supporting its replication. Recently, a unique HCV strain JFH1 has been found to replicate efficiently in cell culture with production of infectious HCV (HCVcc). Baculovirus vectors were found to be efficient delivery vehicles and a HBV recombinant baculovirus/HepG2 system efficiently delivered the HBV genome into HepG2 resulting in HBV replication. In this study, we developed a recombinant baculovirus expression system to generate infectious HCV particles in hepatoma cell line Huh7-lunetT7 by using cDNA from the HCV JFH1 genotype. Results show that HCV positive, negative RNA strands and proteins were produced in this system. Furthermore, HCV particles were produced and secreted into the culture medium. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the culture medium revealed co-localization of HCV RNA and structural proteins in the fraction with a density of 1.08-1.13 g/ml. Electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) showed viral particles approximately 55 nm in diameter, which could be recognized by anti-HCV E2 antibodies. Real-time RT-PCR detected that the level of HCV vRNA in the supernatant was 10(7) copies/ml at 72 h post-transduction (hpt). In addition, the JFH1 virus produced by the recombinant baculovirus was confirmed to be infectious in vitro. In summary, this system provides a novel tool not only for the analysis of the replication and pathogenesis of HCV but also to screen for potential therapeutic targets.",M1
18515145,"Three-dimensional electron microscopy analysis of ndc10-1 mutant reveals an aberrant organization of the mitotic spindle and spindle pole body defects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Kinetochore components play a major role in regulating the transmission of genetic information during cell division. Ndc10p, a kinetochore component of the essential CBF3 complex in budding yeast is required for chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle. ndc10-1 mutant was shown to display chromosome mis-segregation as well as an aberrant mitotic spindle (Goh and Kilmartin, 1993). In addition, Ndc10p localizes along the spindle microtubules (Muller-Reichert et al., 2003). To further understand the role of Ndc10p in the mitotic apparatus, we performed a three-dimensional electron microscopy (<e>EM</e>) reconstruction of mitotic spindles from serial sections of cryo-immobilized ndc10-1 mutant cells. This analysis reveals a dramatic reduction in the number of microtubules present in the half-spindle, which is connected to the newly formed spindle pole body (SPB) in ndc10-1 cells. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type (WT) cells, ndc10-1 cells showed a significantly lower signal intensity of the SPB components Spc42p and Spc110p fused with GFP, in mother cell bodies compared with buds. A subsequent EM analysis also showed clear defects in the newly formed SPB, which remains in the mother cell during anaphase. These results suggest that Ndc10p is required for maturation of the newly formed SPB. Intriguingly, mutations in other kinetochore components, ndc80-1 and spc24-1, showed kinetochore detachment from the spindle, similar to ndc10-1, but did not display defects in SPBs. This suggests that unattached kinetochores are not sufficient to cause SPB defects in ndc10-1 cells. We propose that Ndc10p, alongside its role in kinetochore-microtubule interaction, is also essential for SPB maturation and mitotic spindle integrity.",M1

18445162,"Moving <e>EM</e>: the Rapid Transfer System as a new tool for correlative light and electron microscopy and high throughput for high-pressure freezing.In this paper, the Rapid Transfer System (RTS), an attachment to the Leica EMPACT2 high-pressure freezer, is described as a new tool for special applications within the cryofixation field. The RTS is an automated system that allows for fast processing of samples (&lt;5 s) that make it possible for the first time to use high-pressure freezing in combination with high time resolution correlative light and electron microscopy. In addition, with a working cycle of 30 s this rapid turn over time allows one to acquire more samples of biopsy material before it deteriorates than with other HPF machines with longer cycle times. With the use of the RTS it was possible to obtain three samples each of four different tissues in 6 min. Together with the finding that 90% of samples of cells grown on sapphire discs were well frozen, the RTS was both fast and reliable. Most important, together with other newly developed accessories, the RTS made it possible to capture specific events occurring live in the cell as observed by light microscopy, to cryofix that sample/event within 4 s, and then to analyze that event at high resolution in the electron microscope with excellent preservation of ultra-structure. These developments should give us the tools to unravel intracellular processes that can be observed by live cell imaging but are too rare or fast to be picked up by routine EM methods or where the history of a structure is necessary to be able to discern its nature.",M1

METHODS: Report of a 67-year-old patient with medical history of recurrent iridocyclitis and arthritis presented with a bilateral, progressive, asymmetric crystalline keratopathy, which was particularly pronounced in the peripheral temporal superior cornea. After penetrating keratoplasty, crystalline keratopathy with stromal haziness recurred. Corneal regrafting was performed. The corneal specimen from the penetrating keratoplasty was examined by light and EM as well as by PCR. RESULTS: In the explanted corneal graft, as well as retrospectively in the corneal specimen from the first keratoplasty, spirochetelike bodies and fragments were detected by light and EM. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was demonstrated by broad-range (16S rDNA) PCR. A more precise identification as Borrelia garinii serotype 5 was possible by analyses of the flaB and ospA gene sequences. Borrelia-specific serological tests showed borderline titers in immunofluorescence and weak reaction in immunoblot, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that borreliae must be considered as a cause of crystalline keratopathy; Borrelia-specific serological tests can be false negative; explanted cornea specimens of etiologically unclear crystalline keratopathy should be analyzed by EM or PCR for detection of pathogens; and prolonged antibiotic treatment might be effective to prevent progression or recurrence of the disease.",M1
18433710,"Three-dimensional structure of respiratory complex I from Escherichia coli in ice in the presence of nucleotides.Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest protein complex of bacterial and mitochondrial respiratory chains. The first three-dimensional structure of bacterial complex I in vitrified ice was determined by electron cryo-microscopy and single particle analysis. The structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme incubated with either NAD(+) (as a reference) or NADH was calculated to 35 and 39 A resolution, respectively. The X-ray structure of the peripheral arm of Thermus thermophilus complex I was docked into the reference <e>EM</e> structure. The model obtained indicates that Fe-S cluster N2 is close to the membrane domain interface, allowing for effective electron transfer to membrane-embedded quinone. At the current resolution, the structures in the presence of NAD(+) or NADH are similar. Additionally, side-view class averages were calculated for the negatively stained bovine enzyme. The structures of bovine complex I in the presence of either NAD(+) or NADH also appeared to be similar. These observations indicate that conformational changes upon reduction with NADH, suggested to occur by a range of studies, are smaller than had been thought previously. The model of the entire bacterial complex I could be built from the crystal structures of subcomplexes using the EM envelope described here.",M1

The amount of specimen required is typically 10(2) to 10(3) times less than for X-ray crystallography or NMR. Electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated specimens portray native structures. Computer averaging yields enhanced images with reduced noise. Three-dimensional reconstructions may be computed from multiple views. Under favorable circumstances, resolutions of 7 to 10 A are achieved. Fitting atomic-resolution coordinates of components into three-dimensional density maps gives pseudo-atomic models of a complex's structure and interactions. Time-resolved experiments describe conformational changes. Electron tomography allows reconstruction of pleiomorphic complexes and sub-cellular structures. Electron crystallography has produced near-atomic resolution models of two-dimensional arrays, notably of membrane proteins.",M1

Furthermore, EM has been shown to potently inhibit the proliferation of different types of cancer cells in culture apparently by targeting microtubules; however, the antiproliferative mechanism of action of EM is not clear. In this work, we have shown that EM strongly suppressed the dynamic instability of individual microtubules in MCF-7 cells by reducing the rates of growing and shortening excursions and increasing the time microtubule spent in the pause state. At its half maximal proliferation inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), EM exerted strong suppressive effects on the dynamics of microtubules in MCF-7 cells without detectably affecting either the organization or the polymerized mass of microtubules. At relatively high concentrations (5 x IC(50)), EM significantly depolymerized microtubules in the cells. Furthermore, the microtubules were found highly acetylated, supporting the conclusion that they were stabilized by the drug. EM treatment induced spindle abnormalities in MCF-7 cells, and a major population of the arrested mitotic cells was multipolar. EM also perturbed the microtubule-kinetochore interaction, thereby activating the spindle assembly checkpoint and leading to apoptotic cell death.",M2
15869993,"Combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, estramustine and suramin for hormone refractory prostate cancer.PURPOSE: To investigate more effective chemotherapy against hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) with the combination of estramustine (<e>EM</e>), docetaxel, and suramin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients with symptomatic, progressive HRPC were included in this study. We evaluated the activity of the following schedule: EM 10 mg/kg orally daily on Days 1 to 21 every 28 days, docetaxel 70 mg/m(2) IV on Day 2 every 28 days and a total doses of 2150 mg of suramin in every cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23.4 months. A median of 8.8 consecutive cycles was administered per patient. In the 25 patients with lymphadenopathy, there were three (12%) complete and 18 (72%) partial responses for a measurable disease response rate of 84%. Levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) decreased by greater than 50% in 100% of patients and by greater than 90% in 76.2%. The median time to progression was 57 weeks and median overall survival was 132 weeks. A decline in PSA of &gt; or =50% lasting &gt; or =30 days was significantly associated with a prolonged median time to progression and median overall survival. Tumor volume reduction and/or antitumor treatment effects were observed in 88% of patients. A significant decrease in mean pain score from 7.8 (range, 6-10) to 2.2 (range, 0-4) (P &lt; 0.001) was achieved in 78%. Of patients with bone metastasis, 30.5% demonstrated a partial response. The mean Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score improved from 2.8 to 1.5 at the end of treatment period. There was no therapy-related death. The predominant toxicities were Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 33.3%, anemia in 21%, thrombocytopenia in 21.4%, cardiac ischemia in 4.7%, and rash in 4.7%. CONCLUSION: The combination of docetaxel, EM, and suramin is a highly effective regimen for HRPC. Although hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities were modest, these were easily managed medically.",M2
11445480,"Phase I trial of weekly paclitaxel plus oral estramustine phosphate in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.OBJECTIVES: To exploit the favorable dose intensity and safety profile of weekly paclitaxel, we conducted a Phase I trial of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion in combination with estramustine phosphate (<e>EM</e>) in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The antimicrotubule drug combination of paclitaxel by 96-hour infusion plus EM is active in HRPC. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with metastatic HRPC and progressive tumor after antiandrogen withdrawal were enrolled in this study. Oral EM was taken at a dose of 600 mg/m(2) daily for the initial 21 patients and on a reduced schedule of 280 mg twice daily for the final 3 patients. Paclitaxel was escalated from 60 to 118 mg/m(2). RESULTS: The major toxicities were gastrointestinal and thromboembolic complications related to daily oral dosing of EM. Of the first 21 patients, one third (n = 7) discontinued therapy within 4 weeks because of protracted nausea and/or thrombotic complications. Dose-limiting toxicities at 118 mg/m(2) paclitaxel were fatigue and hepatotoxicity. Of 13 patients with measurable soft-tissue lesions, 6 had objective partial regressions, and 9 (37.5%) of 24 patients (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 59.1%) with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels had a 50% or greater decline of at least 4 weeks' duration. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly paclitaxel at doses of 60 to 107 mg/m(2) were feasible in combination with oral EM, but daily oral EM produced unacceptable toxicity. On the basis of these results, a Phase II trial of weekly paclitaxel with the reduced dose and schedule of EM was initiated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group to assess further the benefits and risks of this treatment in men with metastatic HRPC.",M2
11331330,"Phase II study of docetaxel, estramustine, and low-dose hydrocortisone in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer: a final report of CALGB 9780. Cancer and Leukemia Group B.PURPOSE: To investigate the combination of docetaxel, estramustine (<e>EM</e>), and low-dose hydrocortisone in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Combinations of EM with other antimitotic agents such as docetaxel are synergistic in vitro and show significant clinical activity in patients with HRPC. We studied intravenous administration of docetaxel 70 mg/m(2), oral estramustine, and low-dose daily hydrocortisone in men with HRPC who demonstrated progression after initial hormone therapy. RESULTS: Of the 47 men enrolled onto this multicenter cooperative group study, 46 were assessable for response and/or toxicity. In the 24 patients with measurable disease, there were three complete and nine partial responses for a measurable disease response rate of 50% (12 of 24 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 73%). In the 44 patients in whom pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was elevated, 30 (68%) had a 50% or greater decrease, and 25 (57%) had a 75% or greater decrease in PSA. The combined measurable disease and biochemical response rate in all 46 assessable patients was 54% (three complete responses, 22 partial responses, 95% CI, 37% to 71%). The predominant toxicity was neutropenia, with 26% of patients having grade 3 and 30% having grade 4 granulocytopenia; there were no episodes of febrile neutropenia. Other common but mild adverse effects included malaise/fatigue, peripheral edema, and hyperglycemia. The incidence of thromboembolic events during therapy was 9%. With a median follow-up of 17 months, the median survival was 20 months. The median time to disease progression was 8 months for all patients, and 10 months for those with measurable disease. CONCLUSION: This therapy is efficacious and moderately well tolerated in HRPC and should be compared in a phase III trial with mitoxantrone and prednisone.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 201 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, progressive after hormonal therapy and antiandrogen withdrawal (if prior antiandrogen treatment), were randomized to receive vinblastine (V) 4 mg/m(2) by intravenous bolus weekly for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, either alone or together with estramustine phosphate (<e>EM</e>-V) 600 mg/m(2) PO days 1 through 42, repeated every 8 weeks. Of 193 eligible patients, 98 received V, and 95 received EM-V. RESULTS: Overall survival trended in favor of EM-V but was not significantly different as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P =.08). Median survival was 11.9 months for EM-V and 9.2 months for V. EM-V was superior to V for secondary end points of time to progression (P &lt;. 001, stratified log rank test; median 3.7 v 2.2 months, respectively) and for proportion of patients with &gt;/= 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline sustained for at least 3 monthly measurements (25.2% v 3.2%, respectively; P &lt;.0001). Granulocytopenia was significantly less for EM-V compared with V (grade 2, 3, and 4 = 7%, 7%, and 1% v 27%, 18% and 9%, respectively; P &lt;.0001); however, grade 2 or worse nausea (26% v 7%, respectively; P =.0002) and extremity edema (22% v 8%, respectively; P =.005) were more frequent for EM-V. CONCLUSION: Although overall survival was not significantly greater for the combination, EM-V was superior to V for time to progression and PSA improvement.

A two-color FISH was performed by using centromeric probes for chromosome 2 (FITC labeled) and the X chromosome (TRITC labeled) to measure chromosome loss and gain events in binucleated cells. GF induced mainly aneuploid binucleates involving the X chromosome, but this was not associated with preferential loss of one of the two chromosomes. EM preferentially induced aneuploidy of chromosome 2, and Na(3)VO(4) of the X chromosome. Our results indicate that chromosome malsegregation events (chromosome loss and/or gain) are probably not randomly induced, suggesting that different mechanisms leading to aneuploidy may be either chromosome-dependent or compound- and dose- related.",M2
10461848,"Estramustine resistance.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>), a conjugate of nornitrogen mustard and estradiol, is a antimicrotubule drug currently in use for the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. Experimental data are accumulating concerning the antitumor effect of EM in other malignancies, and clinical studies in other malignancies are ongoing. This review summarizes the information available to date concerning the effects of EM and the development of drug resistance. EM depolymerizes microtubules by binding to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) as well as tubulin. Because of the radiosensitizing effect of this drug there has been a recent increase in interest concerning estramustine and its clinical use. Recently, it was proposed that EM induces an apoptotic cell death in glioma cells in vitro and in a rat model. EM resistance is distinct from MDR phenotype; it has been used in combination with antimitotic agents which are part of the MDR phenotype. Observations made with estramustine-resistant cell lines show the acquisition of estramustine resistance is a function of multiple adaptation by changes at tubulin expression pattern, and is also associated with changes in tau expression and phosphorylation.",M2
10375110,"Induction of apoptosis and suppression of clonogenicity of ovarian carcinoma cells with estrogen mustard.BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate whether estramustine (estrogen mustard [<e>EM</e>]) is a promising alternative in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OVCA). EM is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) specific antimicrotubule agent with low toxicity. METHODS: The authors investigated the ability of EM to induce apoptosis and suppress colony formation of OVCA cells. Paclitaxel was used as a positive control. DNA electrophoresis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to detect internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Flow cytometry was used to identify apoptotic cells and disturbance of the cell cycle of EM-treated OVCA cells further. Quantitation of detached cultured cells also provided a relative estimate of the apoptotic response of OVCA cells to treatment with EM. The colony formation assay was used to evaluate the effects of EM on clonogenicity. RESULTS: The effects of EM on four OVCA cell lines in culture were highly similar to those of paclitaxel in causing apoptosis and inhibiting clonogenicity. DNA electrophoresis and TUNEL assays showed that EM induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in OVCA cells. Flow cytometry showed changes typical of apoptotic changes and cell cycle block and synchronization at the G2/M-phase. Counting of detached cells showed a log-dose response to EM treatment. The colony formation assay also showed a log-dose response suppression of OVCA cell clonogenicity after treatment with EM. CONCLUSIONS: EM may be a promising candidate in the clinical treatment of patients with OVCA. The lower toxicity and MAP specific action of EM is a novel chemotherapy for OVCA.",M2
9679768,"Estramustine resistance correlates with tau over-expression in human prostatic carcinoma cells.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) is an anti-microtubule drug used in the treatment of hormone-refractory advanced prostate cancer. Since microtubules are the targets for EM cytotoxicity, we investigated the effects of EM on the microtubule-associated protein tau to determine what role it may play in drug resistance. We have compared tau expression in human prostate cancer cells (DU145) and an EM-resistant derived cell line (E4). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction has established that tau is expressed in both cell lines but increased 1.9-fold in E4 compared with DU145 cells. This result was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. Tau is a phosphoprotein, most of its reported phosphorylation sites being serine or threonine residues. We have shown, however, that tau is also phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in DU145 cells and that the phosphotyrosine level of tau is significantly increased in E4 cells. Moreover, DU145 cells exposed to short term micromolar drug concentrations enter a phase of microtubule depolymerization, display an increased level of tau phosphorylation and follow a pattern similar to that observed in EM-resistant E4 cells. EM is therefore able to induce a very rapid change in the posttranslational state of tau. Our results show that the acquisition of EM resistance in E4 cells, which is accompanied by changes at the tubulin level, is also associated with important changes in tau expression and phosphorylation.",M2
9508362,"Induction of aneuploidy by the antineoplastic drug estramustine in human lymphocytes.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) is an antineoplastic drug used in the therapy of human prostatic carcinoma. The aim of our work was to evaluate the potential aneuploidogenic activity of estramustine, by analysing its cytogenetic effects induced in human lymphocytes. To estimate the ability of EM to induce mitotic spindle disturbances, two parameters were used: the presence of c-mitoses (according to the degree of chromatid spreading and contraction) and mitotic index evaluation (increase after exposure indicating the accumulation of mitoses). EM induced c-mitoses and mitotic index increases starting from the 4 microM dose: statistically significant increases were observed up to the highest dose (40 microM). A strong correlation between c-mitoses and mitotic index increase was found. The micronucleus (MN) assay combined with the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique with a pancentromeric DNA probe was also carried out. Compared to the control, EM induced significant MN increases in binucleated lymphocytes at two doses (8-16 microM). Moreover, we found that estramustine induced significant percentages of MN with positive hybridization signal at the same doses, confirming the presence of entire chromosomes in micronuclei. Additional experiments included induction of numerical and structural chromosome aberrations, and evaluation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and satellited (D- and G-group chromosomes) chromosome associations. The results of numerical chromosome aberration analysis indicated that EM was positive in inducing a statistically significant increase in aneuploid cells and/or polyploid cells at all doses tested. On the basis of these observations, EM may be defined as a typical aneuploidy inducer, whereas it was not found to increase the frequency of structural chromosome aberrations and SCE frequency.",M2
9484799,"Association of estramustine resistance in human prostatic carcinoma cells with modified patterns of tubulin expression.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) is an antimicrotubule drug used in the treatment of hormone refractory advanced prostate cancer. To investigate the mechanism of resistance to EM, we compared its effects on human prostate cancer cells (DU145) and an estramustine-resistant derived cell line (E4). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that EM caused depolymerization of microtubules and blocked cells in mitosis in DU145 cells, with less effect in E4 cells. Using tubulin isotype-specific antibodies, a threefold increase in betaIII and approximately twofold increase in betaI + II isotype in E4 cells compared to DU145 cells were observed. A most interesting observation concerned an increase in the posttranslational modification of alpha-tubulin of both polyglutamylation and acetylation in the E4 cells. Significant to this observation, using direct EM photoaffinity labeling of tubulin, drug binding to the most acidic posttranslationally modified forms of alpha-tubulin was shown to be minimal. Taken together, these results indicate that the modification of the tubulin expression pattern may be responsible for estramustine resistance by both lowering the amount of drug bound to microtubules and inducing more stable microtubules.",M2
8938148,"Potentiation by estramustine of the cytotoxic effect of vinblastine and doxorubicin in prostatic tumor cells.The effects of combining estramustine (<e>EM</e>) with vinblastine (VLB) or doxorubicin (DOX) on cellular uptake, cellular retention and cell survival were investigated in Dunning hormone-insensitive rat prostate AT-1 tumor cells and DU-145 human prostatic tumor cells. Accumulation of VLB and DOX by AT-1 cells was less than one-half of that in DU-145 cells. Inclusion of EM or estromustine considerably increased uptake of both VLB and DOX in AT-1 cells but not in DU-145 cells. Verapamil and tamoxifen also potentiated VLB uptake in AT-1 cells. A combination of VLB and EM resulted in a considerable synergistic effect on both cytotoxicity and cellular retention of VLB. The presence of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in AT-1 cells could be demonstrated by both Western blots and immunocytochemical detection. Photoaffinity labeling of Pgp by [3H]-azidopine was clearly inhibited by VLB, verapamil and EM. Our data strongly support the argument for a combination of EM with not only VLB but also DOX to improve the therapeutic index in patients with prostate cancer.",M2

In addition, the uptake of these drugs in AT-1 tumor cells in culture was examined. Binding of VLB was six-fold lower than that of EM in membrane preparations from all three sources. The uptake of VLB in the intact AT-1 cells was nearly five-fold lower than that of EM. At concentrations comparable to those achieved clinically the binding of EM was 100-fold higher than that of VLB. The data suggest that, owing to a very high membrane concentration of EM relative to that of VLB, the active efflux VLB in drug resistant cells would be impeded. This in turn would lead to a higher accumulation of VLB in cells that actively transport cytotoxic drugs.",M2
8712706,"Estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) content in four different cell lines and its correlation to estramustine induced metaphase arrest.It is known that estramustine (<e>EM</e>) accumulates in cells at the G2/M-phase and causes metaphase arrest of various cell types. The inhibitory effect is mediated by interaction with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and/or tubulin. Estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) is a secretory protein which has been found in a number of different tumor cells and has been shown to faciliate the uptake of EM into cells. In this study the efficacy of EM in arresting cells at metaphase was studied, using four different human cell lines; the prostatic cancer cell line DU 145, the breast cancer cell line MDA 231, the colon cancer cell line Colon 320, and the urinary bladder cancer cell line RT4. The cells were incubated with EM at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml for 24 hours. The data reveal an increase in metaphase arrests in the DU 145 and in Colon 320 cell lines. Both of these cell lines were found to contain high amounts of EMBP using a dot-blot assay. The other two cell lines, MDA 231 and RT4 had undetectable intracellular amounts of the protein and exhibited a low increase in metaphase arrests. The cell lines were analysed regarding S-phase fraction with flow-cytometry (FCM) to exclude the growth rate of the cells as a limiting factor. The results from the FCM confirmed the cytogenic analysis, that is a higher percentage of cells were in the G2/M phase in both the DU 145 and Colon 320 cell line compared to MDA 231 and RT4. EM causes mitotic arrest in those cell lines that contain detectable amounts of EMBP.",M2

To understand the effect of EM on beta-tubulin, a cellular target for this class of drugs, human prostate carcinoma cells (DU-145) were made resistant to EM, and two cell lines were selected at 12- (EM-12) and 15-microMolar (EM-15) concentrations of the drug. These cell lines exhibited 8- to 9-fold resistance to EM and 2- to 4-fold cross-resistance to paclitaxel. Immunofluorescent staining of the cells with beta-tubulin isotype-specific antibodies showed an approximately 6-fold increase in the beta(III)-tubulin levels and moderate increase in overall beta-tubulin levels in EM-resistant cells when compared to DU-145 cells. This increase of beta(III) isotype was confirmed by Western analysis. A reverse transcriptase-PCR assay was also employed using beta-tubulin isotype-specific primers to quantify beta-tubulin isotype RNA. A 4-fold increase in beta(III) and a 3-fold increase in beta(IV alpha) transcript were seen in both EM-resistant cell lines. These results indicate that overexpression of specific beta-tubulin isotypes may play a role in the cellular defense against EM and other antimicrotubule agents.",M2

The results showed: (1) EM inhibited growth of both cell lines in a dose dependent manner giving ID50 for Ishikawa as 12 microM and for EIIL as 65 microM. (2) The addition of EM to the culture medium caused cell detachment and death associated with a breakdown of DNA to approximately 90 base pair fragments. (3) Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to examine expressions of c-erbB-2, nidogen and fas showed that EM completely abolished fas expression and resulted in a 40% decrease in nidogen expression in Ishikawa but not in EIIL. No change was seen in c-erbB-2 expression. The present data indicate that the E component of EM does not stimulate the growth of Ishikawa or EIIL. Since the growth of both cell lines was inhibited but apparently in an E receptor (ER) dependent manner, EM may be of value in an adjuvant therapy for endometrial cancer, especially an ER positive one.",M2
7916009,"Estramustine: a novel radiation enhancer in human carcinoma cells.PURPOSE: Estramustine (<e>EM</e>), an antimicrotubule agent, binds microtubule-associated proteins, causes spindle disassembly, and arrests cells at the late G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Since cells in the G2/M phase are the most radiosensitive and some human cancer cells contain high level of EM-binding protein, experiments were carried out to determine whether radiation sensitization could be obtained in human carcinoma cells. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cells containing a high level of EM-binding protein such as prostate carcinoma (DU-145), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and malignant glioma (U-251) were used to demonstrate radiosensitization. Cervical carcinoma (HeLa-S3) and colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells which are not known to contain EM-binding protein were also employed. Cell survival was assayed by the colony forming ability of single plated cells in culture to obtain dose-survival curves. RESULTS: Pretreatment of DU-145, MCF-7, and U-251 cells to a nontoxic concentration (5 microM) of EM for more than one cell cycle time, substantially enhanced the radiation-induced cytotoxicity. The sensitizer enhancement ratio of these cells ranged from 1.35-1.52. The magnitude of the enhancement was dependent on the drug concentration and exposure time. The rate of cell accumulation in G2/M phase, as determined by flow cytometry, increased with longer treatment time in the cell lines which showed radiosensitization. Other antimicrotubule agents such as taxol and vinblastine caused minimal or no radiosensitization at nontoxic concentrations. CONCLUSION: The data provide a radiobiological basis for using EM as a novel radiation enhancer, with the property of tissue selectivity.",M2
9419755,"Estrogen mustard induces cell cycle arrest of human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines.OBJECTIVE: Pharmacologic disruption of microtubule function may provide effective therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, as has been observed in clinical trials using taxol. However, the limited availability of taxol and taxol's side effects emphasize a need to develop alternative antimicrotubule agents. Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) inhibits binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to microtubules, promotes microtubule disassembly, disrupts spindle formation, and induces metaphase arrest in human prostate carcinoma and glioma cells in culture. We studied the effect of EM on DNA synthesis and on the cell cycle in four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and examined the cell lines for evidence of MAP-like immunoreactivity. METHODS: The effect of EM on DNA synthesis and on the cell cycle was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Microtubule-associated protein-like immunoreactivity was determined using monoclonal antibodies directed against MAP 1A, MAP 1B, and MAP 2(2A + 2B) for Western analysis after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: We demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory response to EM in BIXLER, DK2NMA, and SKOV3. BIX3 showed a dose-dependent inhibitory response to EM concentrations from 25 micrograms/mL to 100 micrograms/mL, but a stimulatory response at 10 micrograms/mL. Estramustine inhibited exponentially growing cells by causing mitotic arrest with subsequent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle in all four cell lines. We found MAP 1A, MAP 1B, and MAP 2-like immunoreactivity in all four cells lines studied. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with a MAP-microtubule mechanism of action for EM in ovarian carcinoma cells and provide reason to conduct further study of EM for potential use in the treatment of human epithelial ovarian cancer.",M2
8239495,"Growth of prostatic cancer cells, DU 145, as multicellular spheroids and effects of estramustine.The human prostatic carcinoma cell line DU 145 was grown as multicellular spheroids in vitro. The volume doubling time during the early exponential growth phase was about 5 days. The saturation volume, in the plateau phase of the growth curve, was in the order of 1.4 mm3. The spheroids developed a central degenerative region surrounded by a 0.1-0.3 mm layer of viable cells. The DU 145 spheroid system is planned to be used as a model in studies on chemotherapy and targeted radiotherapy of micrometastases of prostatic cancer. Some effects of the drug estramustine, <e>EM</e>, a conjugate of estradiol and nornitrogen mustard, were analysed in this introductory study. Tritium-labelled estramustine, 3H-EM, bound both in the viable cell layers and in the degenerative region of the spheroid already after 1 hour of incubation which indicated good penetration. The viable cells bound only low levels of 3H-EM while the degenerative region bound 3H-EM to a higher extent. The amount of bound 3H-EM increased after incubation for 24 hours. The binding was nonspecific since it could not be inhibited by pretreatment with an excess of non-radioactive EM. Furthermore, 3H-EM bound to a similar extent in glioma and colon carcinoma spheroids used for comparison. Incubation of DU 145 spheroids for 24 hours with EM (20 mg/ml) induced a growth delay of 6-7 days and a transient increase in the volume of the extracellular spaces for a few days following the treatment. The results showed that the binding of EM to prostate DU 145 cells growing as spheroids was not specific and that the toxic action was limited. An interesting result was that EM works as an extracellular space expander. This might be exploited in combination treatments with other agents.",M2
1353706,"Combined antimicrotubule activity of estramustine and taxol in human prostatic carcinoma cell lines.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) and taxol, two antimicrotubule agents with distinct and apparently opposing mechanisms of action, were found to be effective in combination in the preclinical treatment of EM-resistant and sensitive, wild-type human prostatic carcinoma cell lines. Estramustine combined with 1 nM taxol (concentration 100-fold less than that measured in plasma of patients treated with taxol) produced greater than additive effects on the inhibition of cell survival of both wild-type and EM-resistant cells. When taxol was used with another microtubule-destabilizing drug, vinblastine, no significantly increased cytotoxicity was observed. Other effects on wild-type and EM-resistant cells produced by the combination of EM and taxol included (a) an increased proportion of the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle; (b) no mitotic block; and (c) an increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells from a control value of less than 1% to greater than 20% after drug treatment. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis of the effect of this drug combination on the mitotic spindle apparatus revealed specific examples of aberrant mitotic figures, including multiple asters, cells with two distinct spindles, and tripolar spindles able to traverse mitosis and complete cytokinesis. These data provide supportive preclinical evidence for the potential development of an EM/taxol combination clinical regimen either for prostate or other cancers.",M2

In this study, we have addressed the question of whether estramustine (<e>EM</e>), the main cytostatic metabolite of estramustine phosphate (Estracyt), may act as a radiosensitizing agent. This drug accumulates in prostatic cancer and has also been shown to arrest cancer cells at metaphase both in vitro and in vivo. The human prostatic cancer cell line DU 145 was grown as cultures monolayer and incubated with EM in concentrations varying from 1 to 20 micrograms/ml. External beam irradiation was performed with doses ranging from 0 to 8 Gy using gamma rays from a 60Co source. Clonogenic cell survival (CS) was used to analyse the radiation sensitizing effect of EM. The radiation dose modifying factor (DMF) at the survival level 0.1 was found to be 0.77 in the presence of EM (5 micrograms/ml), i.e., 23% sensitization was obtained. When irradiating cells at the standard fraction dose of 2 Gy in the absence of EM, 22% of the cells lost their clonogenic ability. In presence of EM (5 micrograms/ml), 2 Gy caused 40% of the cells to lose their clonogenic ability. Thus a radiation sensitizing effect of EM was established in the CS assay. It was also of interest to determine if the radiosensitizing effect of EM could be confirmed in a rapid assay. The rapid fluorescence assay was used to observe early damage of the cells. Results showed that by 2 days after exposure to irradiation a weak tendency towards sensitization was seen, while a clear sensitization was obtained after 4 days. This indicates that the rapid assay might be developed to a predictive assay for detection of the response of primary prostate tumor cells to the radiation sensitizing effect of EM.",M2
1892755,"Resistance to the antimitotic drug estramustine is distinct from the multidrug resistant phenotype.Following <e>EMS</e> mutagenesis, three estramustine (EM) resistant DU 145 human prostatic carcinoma cell lines were clonally selected by exposure to incrementally increasing concentrations of the drug. Although only low levels of resistance (approximately 3-fold) were attainable, this resistance was stable in the absence of continuous drug exposure. These EM-resistant clones (EMR 4,9,12) did not exhibit cross resistance to vinblastine, taxol, or adriamycin, and had collateral sensitivity to cytochalasin B. None of the lines had elevated expression of P-glycoprotein mRNA or glutathione S-transferase activity, suggesting a phenotype distinct from the classic multi-drug resistance phenotype. This conclusion was supported further by the observation that two MDR cell lines (FLC mouse erythroleukaemic and SKOV3 human ovarian carcinoma cells) showed sensitivity to EM. Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of the effects of EM on cell cycle traverse revealed that at EM concentrations up to 20 microM an increasing percentage of wild type cells were blocked in G2/M; no such effect occurred in EMR lines. Differential interference contrast microscopy was employed to study EM's effect on mitosis. EMR lines were able to form functional, albeit smaller, spindles at EM concentrations that resulted in chromosomal disorganisation and inhibition of mitotic progression in wild type cells. EMR lines were able to progress through mitosis and cytokinesis at the same rate as untreated cells. Tritiated EM was used to evaluate potential drug uptake/efflux mutations in ERM clones. EMR 4 and 9 incorporate less EM than wild type cells; however, they have significantly decreased cellular volumes. The initial efflux rate constants for EMR clones were greater than for wild type cells. Within 5 min greater than 70% of the drug was lost from resistant cells compared to a 50% loss by the wild type. Although the specific mechanisms of resistance have yet to be defined, the lack of collateral resistance to other MDR/anti-microtubule agents could serve as the basis for the clinical use of EM in combination chemotherapy.",M2
1889971,"Effects of ethinyl oestradiol/polyoestradiol phosphate and estramustine phosphate on some proteins related to haemostasis in prostatic carcinoma patients.Twenty-four previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the prostate were prospectively randomized to one of the following treatments: (1) ethinyl oestradiol combined with polyoestradiol phosphate (EE/EP); (2) estramustine phosphate (<e>EM</e>); (3) bilateral orchiectomy. The effects on some plasma proteins related to haemostasis were studied by measuring the concentrations of alpha-1-antitrypsin, orosomucoid, haptoglobin, antithrombin III, C1-inhibitor and von Willebrand's factor before and 3 months after the start of treatment. Orchiectomy induced a reduction of alpha-1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin, while the other studied proteins were unaffected. It was found that both EE/EP and EM treatment induced significant decreases of orosomucoid, haptoglobin, antithrombin III and C1-inhibitor, while the same treatment increased the plasma concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin. None of these treatments showed any influence on the plasma concentration of the von Willebrand factor. No differences were observed between EE/EP and EM for any of the studied proteins, suggesting comparable oestrogenic effects of these forms of treatment in patients with prostatic carcinoma. The findings are discussed in relation to the proposed difference in thromboembolic complications between EE/EP and EM treatments of prostatic carcinoma patients.",M2
2346305,"The effect of estramustine on microtubuli is different from the direct action via oxygen radicals on DNA and cell membrane.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>), a complex between estradiol-17 beta and nornitrogen mustard, is commonly used in the treatment of prostatic cancer. The exact mechanism of action is unknown but has previously been considered to be mediated through non-DNA targets, specifically with the mitotic spindle, and to be related to the intact EM complex. In the present study, using different cell-systems (monocyte phagocytosis transformed fibroblasts, colon cancer cells), the EM cytotoxicity was also found to involve direct interaxtion with DNA and cell membranes. The interaction with DNA was shown by a DNA precipitation assay using 3H- and 14C- thymidine, and the cell membrane damage by using 86Rb- accumulation as a sensitive marker for active potassium uptake. EM effects in the fibroblasts were inhibited by various metal chelators and radical scavengers. Involvement of free oxygen radicals was further indicated in a cell-free system with an oxygen electrode. The EM inhibition of monocyte phagocytosis was related to the engulfment, and was not at all influenced by radical scavengers. In contrast to EM, neither of its components alone, or together, affected monocyte engulfment. Finally, it was shown that the colon cancer cell-line HT-29 was resistant to both of the two suggested and separate mechanisms for EM toxicity: an interaction with the microtubuli system by the intact EM complex and a more unspecific action mediated by free-oxygen radicals.",M2
2734976,"Difference in uptake of 3H-estramustine in two human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, LNCaP and LNCaP-r.Estramustine, estradiol-3-N-bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate (<e>EM</e>), has been shown to inhibit growth of the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP as well as its subline LNCaP-r. The hormone sensitive LNCaP showed greater sensitivity to the drug than the hormoneresistant LNCaP-r. LNCaP has also shown an increasing sensitivity to 10(-7) M EM, when incubated with different concentrations of steroid hormones. We studied whether the increasing sensitivity was caused by increased uptake of EM. 3H-estramustine was added to medium and the cells were incubated 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, and 4 h, or 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h. No effect of steroids on the uptake of EM was noted, but LNCaP showed a higher uptake of EM compared to LNCaP-r. The uptake of EM in LNCaP increased for eight hours, whereas LNCaP-r reached its maximum uptake after six hours of incubation.",M2
3401247,"Distribution and metabolism of estramustine in HeLa cells and the human prostatic tumour cell line 1013L.The metabolism of estramustine [estradiol-3-N-bis(2-chloroethyl) carbamate] was investigated in the human prostatic tumour cell line 1013L and the human cervix tumour cell line HeLa S3. Uptake studies revealed that estramustine (<e>EM</e>), and its 17-ketoanalogue estromustine (EoM), differed in their nuclear binding pattern in 1013L cells but not in HeLa cells. Most of the nuclear radioactivity from both EM and EoM was found in the fraction containing the majority of the phospholipids. HPLC studies on EM-treated 1013L cells showed the presence of the oxidized metabolite EoM, in the medium, an enrichment of estradiol and estrone in whole cells and EM and EoM bound to the nuclear protein matrix. Similar studies on the HeLa cell line showed a completely different pattern, no metabolites other than EoM were found in the cell medium and whole cells but several very lipophilic metabolites were found bound to the nuclear protein matrix. On investigation of other tumour cell lines these metabolites were found to be unique to HeLa cells. The results extend our knowledge concerning EM and demonstrate that the cell line 1013L is a relevant model system for studying drugs active against human prostatic tumours.",M2
3349462,"Antiinvasive activity of estramustine on malignant MO4 mouse cells and on DU-145 human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro.Estramustine (<e>EM</e>) is a conjugate of estradiol and nor-nitrogen mustard (nor-HN2), which is effective in the treatment of prostate cancer. We have compared the effect of EM with that of the known microtubule inhibitor vinblastine (VLB) on the following functions of malignant MO4 mouse cells and of DU-145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro: directional migration, invasion; and the organization and the assembly/disassembly equilibrium of microtubule complexes. The circular area covered by cells migrating from an aggregate explanted on a solid substrate was taken as an index of directional migration. Invasion was studied through confrontation of MO4 or DU-145 cells with fragments of embryonic chick heart in organ culture. Microtubules were investigated immunocytochemically and through immunodetection on protein blots. VLB and EM inhibited directional migration and invasion of MO4 and DU-145 cells in a dose-dependent manner; equimolar combinations of estradiol plus nor-nitrogen mustard did not mimic these effects. At anti-invasive concentrations VLB led to partial disassembly of microtubule complexes, whereas EM resulted in an abnormal pattern of microtubule complexes without alteration of the overall assembly/disassembly equilibrium. Combined treatment with VLB and EM resulted in an enhanced VLB effect, namely complete disassembly. In all tests DU-145 cells were more sensitive to both VLB and EM than were MO4 cells, and the effects were less reversible. The present experiments showed that EM shares an anti-invasive activity with other microtubule inhibitors.",M2
3201650,"Growth inhibiting effect of estramustine on two prostatic carcinoma cell lines, LNCaP and LNCaP-r.The effect of estramustine (<e>EM</e>), estradiol-17 beta (E2) or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the growth of two human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, LNCaP and LNCaP-r was investigated. The hormone resistant subline LNCaP-r was derived in our laboratory, from the hormone sensitive LNCaP cell line. E2, 10(-8) or 10(-5) M inhibited the growth of the LNCaP cells, but did not affect the LNCaP-r. DHT, 10(-8) M, had a stabilizing effect at the stationary phase on the growth of the LNCaP cells whereas at higher concentrations, 10(-5) M, the growth rate was decreased. The LNCaP-r cell line was previously reported to be unaffected by DHT. EM inhibited the growth of both cell lines but LNCaP was more sensitive than LNCaP-r. E2 and DHT modulated the effect of EM. When treated with 10(-7) M EM, addition of E2 or DHT (10(-7)-10(-5) M) further inhibited the growth. When EM was used at a higher concentration (10(-5) M), the enhanced effect of growth inhibition by hormone addition was lost. Based on these results it is suggested that the presence of endogenous hormones, or estrogens released from EM on hydrolysis, may play a contributory role in the cytotoxicity of estramustine.",M2
3598276,"[Studies on the anti-tumor effect of the E2 carrier drug and its mechanism]In this study, the anti-tumor effect of E2 carrier drug on MM2 cells transplanted to C3H/He mice and its mechanism were observed. The results were as follows. The estrogen receptor on cytosol in MM2 cell and nuclei were positively confirmed, but the progesterone receptor was not. When the effect of this drug on MM2 cells was measured by the ratio of inhibition to the growth of the tumor, the effect on the group treated with a high dose of E2 carrier drug (100mg/kg) was found to be significantly higher than found with physiological saline (p less than 0.05). The main route of action is considered to be not related to the steroid receptor but to the retention of Estramustine (<e>EM</e>-2), Estromustine (EM-1), and Estradiol (E2) in tumor tissues. Histomorphological findings on the MM2 cells treated with E2 carrier drug revealed nuclear pyknosis and giant cell transformation. The strength of these effects seemed to depend on the size of the dose of E2 carrier drug.",M2
3866236,"Dansylated estramustine, a fluorescent probe for studies of estramustine uptake and identification of intracellular targets.Fluorescence-microscopic studies with dansylated estramustine (DnsEM) has permitted investigation of the mechanism of estramustine (<e>EM</e>) uptake in live human prostatic tumor cells (DU 145). DnsEM appeared to enter cells rapidly at the peripheral cell margins. A progressive increase in fluorescence was observed until the perinuclear material and cytoplasm were labeled brightly and the nucleoplasm was labeled faintly. Light microscopy showed that DnsEM is assimilated first in preexisting vesicles and then in numerous newly created vesicles that accumulate in the cytoplasm and around the nucleus. Colony-forming assays showed EM and DnsEM to be equally cytotoxic to cultured DU 145 cells. Cellular uptake and subsequent manifestation of cytotoxicity are presumably dependent upon these vesicles. However, after uptake of DnsEM, its diffusion into the cytoplasm was observed.",M2
