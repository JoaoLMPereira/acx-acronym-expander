20427158,"Inhibition dysfunction in depression: event-related potentials during negative affective priming.The study aimed to investigate whether depressed patients show impairment of valence-dependent inhibition and its neurophysiological correlates. Event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) were collected from 18 patients with unipolar depression and 18 normal controls during an affective negative priming task. A less effective inhibition in patients was specific for negative information. These behavioral effects were paralleled by ERP differences. In addition to the overall reduced P2 amplitude for negative trials and the overall reduced late positive component (LPC) amplitude for positive and negative trials in patients, ERP differences in different conditions for each group were also found. The patients showed reduced central-parietal P2 amplitude and shorter LPC latency in response to negative experimental targets, whereas the controls showed larger left central P2 amplitude and delayed LPC latency in response to negative experimental targets. No such effects were found for positive targets. These results suggest that the inhibition dysfunction of negative affect influences the earlier attention allocation stage and the later evaluation stage in depressed patients.",M1
20403632,"EEG theta and alpha responses reveal qualitative differences in processing taxonomic versus thematic semantic relationships.Despite the importance of semantic relationships to our understanding of semantic knowledge, the nature of the neural processes underlying these abilities are not well understood. In order to investigate these processes, 20 healthy adults listened to thematically related (e.g., leash-dog), taxonomically related (e.g., horse-dog), or unrelated (e.g., desk-dog) noun pairs as their EEG was recorded. The data were analyzed using both event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The spatiotemporal ERP and ERSP results were analyzed further with principal component analysis (PCA). When comparing unrelated to related word pairs, the expected N400 effect was confirmed, as well as differences in theta and alpha oscillations. When comparing thematically and taxonomically related word pairs, the ERP revealed no significant differences, but the ERSP did. Specifically, theta power increased over right frontal areas for thematic versus taxonomic relationships and alpha power increased over parietal areas for taxonomic versus thematic relationships. The different oscillatory patterns over different brain regions suggest that thematic and taxonomic relationships engage distinct neural processes. Specifically, thematic relationships engage memory processes, while taxonomic relationships may require additional inhibitory or attention processes.",M1
20400937,"High density event-related potential data acquisition in cognitive neuroscience.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently the standard method of evaluating brain function in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience, in part because fMRI data acquisition and analysis techniques are readily available. Because fMRI has excellent spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution, this method can only be used to identify the spatial location of brain activity associated with a given cognitive process (and reveals virtually nothing about the time course of brain activity). By contrast, event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) recording, a method that is used much less frequently than fMRI, has excellent temporal resolution and thus can track rapid temporal modulations in neural activity. Unfortunately, ERPs are under utilized in Cognitive Neuroscience because data acquisition techniques are not readily available and low density ERP recording has poor spatial resolution. In an effort to foster the increased use of ERPs in Cognitive Neuroscience, the present article details key techniques involved in high density ERP data acquisition. Critically, high density ERPs offer the promise of excellent temporal resolution and good spatial resolution (or excellent spatial resolution if coupled with fMRI), which is necessary to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of human brain function.",M1
20395549,"Brain sensitivity to print emerges when children learn letter-speech sound correspondences.The acquisition of reading skills is a major landmark process in a human's cognitive development. On the neural level, a new functional network develops during this time, as children typically learn to associate the well-known sounds of their spoken language with unfamiliar characters in alphabetic languages and finally access the meaning of written words, allowing for later reading. A critical component of the mature reading network located in the left occipito-temporal cortex, termed the  visual word-form system  (VWFS), exhibits print-sensitive activation in readers. When and how the sensitivity of the VWFS to print comes about remains an open question. In this study, we demonstrate the initiation of occipito-temporal cortex sensitivity to print using functional MRI (fMRI) (n = 16) and event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) (n = 32) in a controlled, longitudinal training study. Print sensitivity of fast (&lt;250 ms) processes in posterior occipito-temporal brain regions accompanied basic associative learning of letter-speech sound correspondences in young (mean age 6.4 +/- 0.08 y) nonreading kindergarten children, as shown by concordant ERP and fMRI results. The occipito-temporal print sensitivity thus is established during the earliest phase of reading acquisition in childhood, suggesting that a crucial part of the later reading network first adopts a role in mapping print and sound.",M1
20390603,"Neurophysiological markers for child emotion regulation from the perspective of emotion-cognition integration: current directions and future challenges.Neuroscientific research on emotion regulation suggests that the interplay between emotion and cognition may be fundamental to the ability to adaptively regulate emotions. Although emotion and cognition have historically been considered to be in opposition, more recent research suggests that they are also integrated, coordinated, and complementary. In this article, I review studies showing that scalp-recorded event related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) reflecting emotion-cognition integration can be used as clinically meaningful indices of emotion regulation in children and adults, and have the potential to serve as biomarkers for emotion regulation and risk for specific affective disorders. Drawing on neuroscience and behavioral research, I propose a model in which ERP measures of emotion-cognition integration rather than opposition is the guiding principle for detecting neural markers for emotion regulation. Suggestions for a future research agenda are then presented.",M1
20390601,"Electrophysiological correlates of cognitive control and the regulation of shyness in children.Shyness is associated with social-emotional maladjustment in some, but not all, children. The ability to flexibly regulate attention under conditions of potential conflict may protect shy children from developing internalizing problems. In the current study, the associations between shyness, the N2 event related potential (<e>ERP</e>) response, and social-emotional adjustment were examined in a sample of 36 typically developing 9- to 13-year-old children. It was hypothesized that the N2 amplitude, an ERP measure associated with aspects of cognitive and attention control, would moderate the associations between shyness and social-emotional functioning (negative attribution style, social self-perceptions, social anxiety). Shyness was unrelated to behavioral or ERP measures collected during a modified Flanker task; however, shyness and N2 amplitude were alone and in combination associated with all three measures of social adjustment. In general, shyness was associated with poor outcomes primarily among children with relatively large amplitude, or enhanced, N2 responses. The results are discussed in terms of the role of conflict sensitivity in the regulation of attention and emotions associated with shyness and the importance of studying the combined influences of reactive and self-regulatory aspects of temperament in relation to adjustment in childhood.",M1
20390599,"Event-related potentials, emotion, and emotion regulation: an integrative review.Progress in the study of emotion and emotion regulation has increasingly been informed by neuroscientific methods. This article focuses on two components of the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>)--the P300 and the late positive potential (LPP)--and how they can be used to understand the interaction between the more automatic and controlled processing of emotional stimuli. Research is reviewed exploring: the dynamics of emotional response as indexed at early and late latencies; neurobiological correlates of emotional response; individual and developmental differences; ways in which the LPP can be utilized as a measure of emotion regulation. Future directions for the application of ERP/electroencephalogram (EEG) in achieving a more complete understanding of emotional processing and its regulation are presented.",M1
20368087,"N400 elicited by incongruent ending words of Chinese idioms in healthy adults.BACKGROUND: Prior research about N400 has been mainly based on English stimuli, while the cognitive processing of Chinese characters is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the semantic processing of Chinese idioms. METHODS: Event related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) component N400 was elicited by 38 pairs of matching (congruent) and mismatching (incongruent) ended Chinese idioms: ending words with same phoneme but different shape and meaning (sPdSdM), with similar shape but different phoneme and meaning (sSdPdM), with same meaning but different phoneme and shape (sMdPdS), and words with different phoneme, shape and meaning (dPdSdM) and recorded by Guangzhou Runjie WJ-1 ERP instruments. In 62 right-handed healthy adults (age 19 - 50 years), N400 amplitudes and latencies were compared between matching and mismatching conditions at Fz, Cz and Pz. RESULTS: N400 showed a midline distribution and could be elicited in electrodes Fz, Cz and Pz. The mean values of N400 latencies and amplitudes were obtained for matching and mismatching ending words in healthy adults. Significant differences were found in N400 latencies and amplitudes in matching and mismatching ending-words idioms in healthy adults (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with matching ending-words idioms, N400 latencies were prolonged and the amplitudes were increased in mismatching ones. N400s elicited by different types of stimuli showed different latencies and amplitudes, and longest N400 latency and largest N400 amplitude were elicited by ending-words with dPdSdM. No gender difference was found of N400 latency and amplitude in this study (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with English stimuli, Chinese ideographic words could provide more flexible stimuli for N400 research in that the words have 3-dimension changes - phoneme, shape and meaning. Features of N400 elicited by matching and mismatching ending words in Chinese idioms are mainly determined by the meaning of the word. Some issues of N400 elicited by Chinese characters deserve further research.",M1
20338218,"Negativity bias of the self across time: an event-related potentials study.To investigate the neural basis of self-evaluation across time as a function of emotional valence, event-related potentials were recorded among participants instructed to make self-reference judgments when evaluating their past, present and future selves. Results showed that, when evaluating present and past selves, negative words elicited a more positive <e>ERP</e> deflection in the time window between 650ms and 800ms (LPC) relative to positive words. However, when evaluating the future selves, there was no significant difference on the amplitude of the LPC evoked by negative versus positive words. Findings provided evidence for the effect of emotional valence on the self across time at a neurophysiological level and identified the time course of negative bias in the temporal self. More specifically, people were inclined to be relatively less negative and optimistic about their future self but had mixed emotions about past and present selves.",M1
20307904,"Do u txt? Event-related potentials to semantic anomalies in standard and texted English.Texted English is a hybrid, technology-based language derived from standard English modified to facilitate ease of communication via instant and text messaging. We compared semantic processing of texted and standard English sentences by recording event-related potentials in a classic semantic incongruity paradigm designed to elicit an N400 effect. In participants fluent in both text and standard English, an N400 effect was elicited in both the texted and standard English conditions. The amplitude and distribution of the N400 effect (300-500ms) in the texted and standard English conditions were similar, but the text semantic incongruity effect was characterized by a delayed peak latency and an extended duration into the 500-700ms epoch. This pattern of results replicates previous findings regarding differences in the N400 effect in native and non-native language processing, but for the first time extends the bilingual <e>ERP</e> literature to include the technological phenomenon of texted English.",M1
20304031,"Early event-related potentials changes during simple mental calculation in Chinese older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A case-control study.The aim was to examine early event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) changes during mental arithmetic calculation task in mild cognitive impairment patients compared to healthy elderly. 16 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 16 healthy Chinese older adults were studied. Event-related potentials were elicited using a simple mental calculation task. Performance on arithmetic calculation task, and the latency and amplitude of early event-related potential components (N1, P1, N170, and P2) were compared between the two groups. The reaction time of MCI group was significantly longer than that of control group (1691.03+/-94.59 vs. 1539.55+/-27.76, P&lt;0.01). The correct rate of MCI group (0.9463+/-0.04) was significantly lower than that of control group (0.9776+/-0.02, P&lt;0.01). The latency of temporal-occipital N170 and central-prefrontal P2 of MCI group were significantly prolonged compared to controls. MCI subjects presented significantly higher P2 amplitude. Compared with healthy controls, N170 was significantly lower at left temporal-occipital region and higher at right temporal-occipital region in mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment patients had deficit on simple calculation. The early arithmetic calculation processing mechanism of mild cognitive impairment patients may be different from normal people.",M1
20302948,"Purely endogenous capture of attention by task-defining features proceeds independently from spatial attention.Attention can be focused voluntarily and effectively on spatial locations in order to enhance the processing of task-relevant events. However, work on 'attentional capture' has demonstrated that spatial biases can be temporarily reset by transient and salient stimuli, especially if they share defining characteristics with the targets of a task goal. In the current study, we investigated whether the appearance of stimuli containing task-defining features at an unattended location was sufficient to capture attention, even when these were not perceptually salient. We used event-related-potential (<e>ERP</e>) markers to test whether the selection of task-defining features was modulated by top-down spatial attention, and to test whether the appearance of 'unattended targets' transiently disrupted the spatial bias. Surprisingly, the results revealed that ERP markers of selection of task-defining features were equivalent for stimuli appearing at spatially attended and unattended locations. In addition, the presentation of task-defining stimuli at the spatially unattended location induced a short-lived redistribution of the pre-established spatial attention bias toward the 'capture' side. These findings show that task-defining features of a stimulus are automatically processed independently from spatial attention, and suggest the co-existence of multiple sources of top-down biasing signals, which might in part sustain the capture mechanism.",M1

There are many advances in neuropsychology due to new assessment tool for the last years. The basic theories in the field of ERP and neuropsychology were reviewed in this article.

20232509,"Line by line: the <e>ERP</e> correlates of stroke order priming in letters.The perception of written letters reflects the action sequences that produce them. Faster recognition is observed for letters presented as sequences of strokes in a temporal order consistent with letter writing, compared to an inconsistent order. During a speeded letter identification task, parietal event-related potential (ERP) components were analysed separately for each stroke-frame in action-consistent and inconsistent stimulus sequences, during both passive and active (task-engaged) viewing. Electrophysiological data provided unique insights into stroke order priming by comparing local neural organisation during early, response-independent stages with later response-dependent stages. ERPs over posterior scalp areas revealed speeded visual processing for action-consistent stroke sequences prior to, and upon, letter completion. These signatures of perceptually facilitated letter processing were present in both active and passive viewing conditions, indicating that priming was not response-contingent, but rather an inherent part of visual letter perception. Stroke order priming is discussed in terms of matching stored letter production action codes, which upon activation provide top-down facilitation for visual processing of letters.",M1
20226842,"Semantic processing in comatose patients with intact temporal lobes as reflected by the N400 event-related potential.The present study aimed at determining whether the N400 effect (an <e>ERP</e> index of semantic processing) for spoken words occurs in comatose patients. The patients, treated in an intensive care unit, scored less than 8 points in the glasgow coma score at the time of the recording. Semantically related and unrelated spoken word pairs were delivered to patients through headphones at a rate of 1/3s. Patients with an intact temporal lobe exhibited differential N400-like responses for semantically related and unrelated word pairs, which suggests that word semantics can be processed even in the comatose state. In contrast, patients with an injured temporal lobe showed no such effect.",M1
20223278,"Earthquake experience interference effects in a modified Stroop task: an <e>ERP</e> study.The effects of the modified Stroop task on ERP were investigated in 20 subjects who had experienced the Sichuan earthquake and a matched control group. ERP data showed that Incongruent stimuli elicited a more negative ERP deflection (N300-450) than did Congruent stimuli between 300 and 450 ms post-stimulus in the earthquake group but not found in the control group, and the N300-450 might reflect conflict monitor (the information of color and meaning do not match) in the early phase of perception identification due to their sensitivity to the external stimulus. Then, Incongruent stimuli elicited a more negative ERP deflection than did Congruent stimuli between 450 and 650 ms post-stimulus in both the groups. Dipole source analysis showed that the N450-650 was mainly generated in the ACC contributed to this effect in the control group, which might be related to monitor and conflict resolution. However, in the earthquake group, the N450-650 was generated in the thalamus, which might be involved in inhibiting and compensating of the ACC which may be related to conflict resolution process.",M1
20217055,"Chronic use of cannabis and poor neural efficiency in verbal memory ability.INTRODUCTION: The endogenous cannabinoid system is sensitive to the introduction of exogenous cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which are known to impact upon memory functioning. We sought to examine the impact of chronic cannabis use upon memory-related brain function via examination of the subsequent memory effect (SME) of the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>). METHODS: The SME is predictive of recall outcome and originates in structures that are dense with cannabinoid receptors (hippocampus and parahippocampus). The SME and performance on a verbal memory task were compared between 24 cannabis users (mean 17 years of near daily use) in the unintoxicated state and 24 non-using controls. The task involved the presentation of word lists, each with a short delay before recall. ERPs were recorded during encoding and later averaged by outcome (correctly recalled/not recalled). RESULTS: Cannabis users showed poorer recall and altered patterns of SME activation: specifically, attenuation of the negative N4 and an increase in the late positive component. Duration of cannabis use and age of initial use correlated significantly with SME amplitudes. A longer history of use also correlated with greater recall that was related to N4 expression. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that relative to non-using controls, chronic users of cannabis have altered memory-related brain activation in the form of dysfunctional SME production and/or poorer neural efficiency, which is associated with deficits in memory recall. Greater alteration was associated with a longer history of cannabis use and an earlier onset of use. Neuroadaptation to the effects of chronic exposure may additionally play a role.",M1
20214929,"Event-related potential patterns and gender effects underlying facial affect processing in schizophrenia patients.This study was designed to clarify the consecutive temporal mechanisms and gender effects underlying facial affect processing in patients with schizophrenia and normal controls through electrophysiological measurements. The following four event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) components were chosen as indexes of four distinct stages: P100, N170, N250, and P300. A total of 38 schizophrenia patients (22 females) and 38 normal controls (20 females) were recruited. ERPs were recorded while participants identified emotions in images of faces showing three different states: happy, fearful and neutral. The mean peak amplitude of N170 was significantly lower in schizophrenia patients than in normal controls. The mean peak amplitudes of N170 and N250 for fearful emotion were significantly higher than that for happy emotion. The latencies of N170, and P300 were longer in schizophrenia patients than in normal controls. Gender effects were found for P100 peak amplitude and N170 latency, and significant interactions with gender were found for P300 amplitudes and P100 latency. Our results provide evidences of the dysfunctional ERP patterns underlying facial affect processing in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, the results suggest that gender could be an important controlling factor for facial affect processing in schizophrenia patients.",M1
20209422,"Temporal dynamics of memory-related effects in older and young adults: an event-related potential study.Priming effects on the identification process were examined in young and older adults by using event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>). Animals and artifacts were presented in an ascending sequence of filtered images, half of which had been shown in their complete versions in a previous study phase. Each stimulus was represented by a progressively less filtered image (i.e., more complete) until the whole version was revealed in a sequence of frames. Such a paradigm allowed us to record ERPs prior to, and during, the identification of stimuli. Results showed a dynamic interplay between memory, category, and aging effects. At the moment of identification, young adults elicited larger positivity at parietal sites for previously studied stimuli and this effect was not observed for older adults. For stimuli previously studied, a striking effect was observed in both groups at the level just prior to overt identification. In addition, a frontally distributed priming effect was evident in the elderly. Category-related ERP differences emerged between the two age groups. In particular, younger participants elicited an early positive activation at anterior sites upon seeing stimuli of animals. These results are discussed in relation to current models of recognition memory, categorization, and age-related cognitive decline.",M1
20205294,"Influence of simple verbal and non-verbal stimuli on brain electrical activity.In this study, the influence of analysis stimulus content on the reaction time (RT) and parameters of the brain activity was investigated. Thirty healthy right-handed volunteers (mean age 24 years) participated in the study. The dynamics of RT, characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) components during perception of digits and non-verbal stimuli were analyzed. The specificity of RT's asymmetry in simple and complex visual-motor reactions depended on stimulus type was revealed. The similarity of early ERP components (peak latency of 100-200 ms) for both stimuli types in simple and complex visual-motor reaction was shown. We also described the formation of specific ERP configuration for digits differentiation such as a left-sided asymmetry of component N200, and increase of peak latency of the late negative component with their extension to the parietal region.",M1
20123462,"Event-related potential correlates of selective processing in early- and continuously-treated children with phenylketonuria: effects of concurrent phenylalanine level and dietary control.This study focused on important characteristics of attentional (selective) processing in children with early-treated phenylketonuria (PKU). Seven to 14-year-old children with PKU were allocated to high phenylalanine (Phe) and low Phe groups and compared with control children on amplitudes and latencies of early and late event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) components elicited during a selective processing task. These components are thought to measure early sensory processes (stimulus encoding/perception) and later selection processes (target detection). The effects of concurrent Phe level and dietary control on brain activity and behavioural performance were studied. Results showed that children with PKU with high Phe levels were less accurate and made more false alarms than controls and children with PKU with low Phe levels. Both children with PKU and controls displayed the expected early fronto-central selection negativity and a late positive peak over posterior sites associated with sensory aspects of the selective attention task. However, in contrast with controls, children with PKU showed an absence of condition differences for selection positivity over anterior sites associated with target detection. Negative and positive selection potentials over fronto-central sites were dependent on concurrent and historical Phe levels, whereas sensory potentials depended more strongly on historical Phe levels. It is concluded that both sensory and selection aspects of attention are affected by Phe levels. The relative predictive strength of historical Phe levels suggests that high Phe levels during sensitive periods for brain maturation may have long-lasting influences on selective attention.",M1
20196100,"Distinct electrocortical and behavioral evidence for increased attention to threat in generalized anxiety disorder.BACKGROUND: Neural activity is increasingly used in addition to behavioral measures to study anxiety and attentional biases toward threatening stimuli. Event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) might be particularly useful because of their excellent temporal resolution. In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) reflects increased attention to emotional stimuli-and was recently found to be larger with increasing state anxiety. This study sought to examine the LPP among individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: Fifteen individuals with GAD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) viewed briefly presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures that were presented to the left and right of, as well as above and below, fixation on each trial; ERP and behavioral measures were recorded as participants indicated whether the horizontal or vertical image pairs were the same or different. RESULTS: Aversive pictures presented in unattended locations were associated with more errors overall, and this effect was larger in GAD than HC participants. Moreover, aversive targets elicited larger LPPs across all participants; this difference was larger in GAD than HC participants when distracters were neutral. CONCLUSIONS: Threatening stimuli presented in both target and distracting spatial locations have a greater impact on GAD than HC participants. Behavioral and ERP measures provide complimentary indices of attention toward threat in GAD. In terms of attentional control theory, behavioral interference indexes impaired processing effectiveness, whereas the LPP might index reduced processing efficiency in GAD. Both measures may provide unique windows onto how increased stimulus-driven attention to threat impacts and characterizes GAD.",M1
20184924,"Event-related potentials associated with Attention Network Test.Selective visual attention is thought to be comprised of distinct neuronal networks that serve different attentional functions. The Attention Network Test (ANT) has been introduced to allow for assessment of alerting, orienting, and response inhibition. Information on associated measures of neural processing during ANT is still scarce. We topographically analyzed top-down ANT effects on visual event-related potential morphology in 44 healthy participants. Significant reaction time effects were obtained for all attention networks. Posterior cue-locked target N1 amplitude was significantly increased during both alerting and orienting. P3 amplitude was significantly modulated at frontal and parietal leads as a function of inhibition. Our data suggests that attentional mechanisms of alerting and orienting are employed simultaneously at early stages of the visual processing stream to amplify perceptual discrimination and load onto the same <e>ERP</e> component. Fronto-parietal modulations of P3 amplitude seem to mirror both response inhibition and visual target detection and may be interesting markers for further studies.",M1
20183724,"Impairments in attention in occasionally snoring children: an event-related potential study.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether minimal snoring is benign in children. PROCEDURE: 22 rarely snoring children (mean age = 6.9 years, 11 females) and age- and sex-matched controls participated in an auditory oddball task wearing 128-electrode nets. Parents completed the Conners Parent Rating Scales-Revised Long (CPRS-R:L). RESULTS: Snorers scored significantly higher on four CPRS-R:L subscales. Stepwise regression indicated that two <e>ERP</e> variables from a region of the ERP that peaked at 844 msec post-stimulus onset predicted CPRS-R:L Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Index scores.

Basic sensory processing is longer than in controls, suggesting that delayed frontal activation requires more effort in snorers.",M1
20183012,"Event-related potential evidence for a dual-locus model of global/local processing.We investigated the perceptual time course of global/local processing using event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>). Participants discriminated the global or local level of hierarchical letters of different sizes and densities. Participants were faster to discriminate the local level of large/sparse letters and the global level of small/dense letters. This was mirrored in early ERP components: The N1/N2 had smaller peak amplitudes when participants made discriminations at the level that took precedence. Only global discriminations for large/sparse letters led to amplitude enhancement of the later P3 component, suggesting that additional attention-demanding processes are involved in discriminating the global level of these stimuli. Our findings suggest a dual-locus time course for global/local processing: (a) Level precedence occurs early in visual processing; (b) extra processing is required at a later stage, but only for global discriminations of large, sparse, stimuli, which may require additional attentional resources for active grouping.",M1
20181386,"Discrimination of native and non-native vowel contrasts in bilingual Turkish-German and monolingual German children: Insight from the Mismatch Negativity <e>ERP</e> component.The development of native-like memory traces for foreign phonemes can be measured by using the Mismatch Negativity (MMN), a component of the auditory event-related potential. Previous studies have shown that the MMN is sensitive to changes in neural organization depending on language experience. Here we measured the MMN response in 5-6year-old monolingual German and bilingual Turkish-German kindergarten children growing up in Germany. MMN was investigated to a German vowel contrast and to a vowel contrast that exists in Turkish and in German. The results show that compared to a German control group, the MMN response is less robust in Turkish-German children to the German vowel contrast. The response to the contrast that exists in both languages does not differ between groups. Overall, the results suggest that the Turkish-German children have not yet fully acquired the German phonetic inventory despite living in Germany since birth and being immersed in a German-speaking environment.",M1
20171999,"The time course of novelty processing in sensation seeking: an <e>ERP</e> study.Novelty processing is critical for human survival in a rapidly changing environment. However, how and when the orientation attention reflected by novelty processing is modulated by personality elements such as sensation seeking is still opened. The present study investigated the time course of novelty processing in sensation seeking by recording the event-related potentials (ERPs) in a visual novelty oddball task. High and low sensation seekers performed a visual oddball task, in which participants were instructed to detect an inverted triangle (target) and ignore both upright triangle (standard) and unrepeated line drawings of pseudo-objects deviant from participants' long-term memory (novelty). While there were no group differences in ERPs to standard and target stimuli, ERPs to novel stimuli showed a strong modulation by sensation seeking trait. The low sensation seekers, compared with the high sensation seekers, exhibited an increased N2 to novel stimuli at frontal sites. Moreover, the Pd3 component reflecting purely novelty processing was enhanced and less habituated in the high sensation seeking participants. The current findings implicated that low sensation seekers showed sensitivity to novelty detection, whereas high sensation seekers displayed stronger and more sustained novelty appraisal.",M1
20170647,"Differences in the neural basis of automatic auditory and visual time perception: <e>ERP</e> evidence from an across-modal delayed response oddball task.In our everyday lives, we need to process auditory and visual temporal information as efficiently as possible. Although automatic auditory time perception has been widely investigated using an index of the mismatch negativity (MMN), the neural basis of automatic visual time perception has been largely ignored. The present study investigated the automatic processing of auditory and visual time perception employing the cross-modal delayed response oddball paradigm. In the experimental condition, the standard stimulus was 200 ms and the deviant stimulus was 120 ms, which were exchanged in the control condition. Reaction time, accuracy, and event-related potential (ERP) data were measured when participants performed the duration discrimination task. The ERP results showed that the MMN, N2b, and P3 were elicited by an auditory deviant stimulus under the attention condition, while only the MMN was elicited under the inattention condition. The MMN was largest over the frontal and central sites, while the difference in MMN amplitude was not significant between under the attention and inattention condition. In contrast, the change-related positivity (CRP) and the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) were elicited by the visual deviant stimulus under both the attention and inattention conditions. The CRP was largest over the occipito-temporal sites under the attention condition and over the fronto-central sites under the inattention condition. The difference in CRP amplitude was significant between the attention and inattention condition. The vMMN was largest over the parieto-occipital sites under the attention condition, and largest over the fronto-central sites under the inattention condition. The difference in vMMN amplitude was significant between the attention and inattention condition. Auditory MMN does not appear to be modulated by attention, whereas the visual CRP and the vMMN are modulated by attention. Therefore, the present study provides electrophysiological evidence for the existence of automatic visual time perception and supports an  attentional switch  hypothesis for a modality effect on duration judgments, such that auditory temporal information is processed relatively automatically, whereas visual temporal information processing requires controlled attention.",M1
20153813,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of olfactory processing in the human brain: an event-related source imaging study.Although brain structures involved in central nervous olfactory processing in humans have been well identified with functional neuroimaging, little is known about the temporal sequence of their activation. We recorded olfactory event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) to H(2)S stimuli presented to the left and right nostril in 12 healthy subjects. Topographic and source analysis identified four distinct processing steps between 200 and 1000 ms. Activation started ipsilateral to the stimulated nostril in the mesial and lateral temporal cortex (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula). Subsequently, the corresponding structures on the contralateral side became involved, followed by frontal structures at the end of the activation period. Thus, based on EEG-related data, current results suggest that olfactory information in humans is processed first ipsilaterally to the stimulated nostril and then activates the major relays in olfactory information processing in both hemispheres. Most importantly, the currently described techniques allow the investigation of the spatial processing of olfactory information at a high temporal resolution.",M1
20153299,"An electrophysiological study of boundary conditions for control of recollection in the exclusion task.Event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) were collected in a memory retrieval task that was designed to assess the resolution with which people exerted control over memory retrieval. Participants were first required to indicate whether the objects denoted by concrete nouns (i) had pleasant or unpleasant connotations, (ii) were typically smaller or larger than a shoebox, or (iii) were easy or difficult to draw. They then completed a retrieval task where old (studied) and new words were presented. Participants pressed one key for words encountered in the drawing task, and a second key for all other test words (new words as well as those encountered in the pleasantness and size judgment tasks). The left-parietal ERP old/new effect--an electrophysiological index of recollection--was reliable for words from the drawing task only. This finding is consistent with the view that participants were successful at prioritising recollection of some kinds of information over others. The data also provide an insight into the resolution with which this prioritisation can be implemented, because there was little evidence of a left-parietal ERP old/new effect for words to which a size judgment was made, despite the fact that visual imagery is likely to have been employed for drawing as well as for size judgments.",M1
20153298,"Stimulus and response conflict in the color-word Stroop task: a combined electro-myography and event-related potential study.We aimed to separate stimulus and response conflict in a manual color-word Stroop task by combining electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (<e>ERPs</e>). EMG served as a measure of response conflict by detecting incorrect response hand activation in correctly responded trials. Response conflict was enhanced in both the incongruent and congruent conditions relative to neutral conditions. This suggests that the Stroop conflict (incongruent vs. congruent condition) could be explained by stimulus conflict in our study and that response conflict was not restricted to the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. Incorrect response activity was detected in a neutral condition using words but not in a neutral condition with non-words. This suggests that the mere presence of task-irrelevant stimuli semantically related to task-relevant stimuli can prime incorrect response activity. The above factors are important to consider in studies which do not have any explicit measure of response conflict. We have detected a robust marker of Stroop conflict, the N450 ERP effect, which has been related to ACC activity. The N450 was probably affected by stimulus conflict in our study and it may be a marker of general conflict processing.",M1
20147859,"<e>ERP</e> effects of change localization, change identification, and change blindness.Change blindness is the failure to detect changes in visual scenes. Changes can elicit phenomenologically different perceptual experiences, possibly relating to different mechanisms: changes may be entirely missed, merely detected, located, or identified. We presented sequences of meaningful objects, one of which could change between the presentations. Changes had to be located and identified. Observers sometimes located the change without knowing which object had changed. However, effects of localization with and without identification were remarkably similar on a sequence of event-related potential components (including change-related positivity and N2pc). Only a late contralateral positivity was found exclusively for identified changes, indicating that change localization and change identification initially rely on a common processing sequence and differ only at later stages.",M1
20141239,"Electrophysiological correlates of emotional responding in schizophrenia.People with schizophrenia consistently report normal levels of pleasant emotion when exposed to evocative stimuli, suggesting intact consummatory pleasure. However, little is known about the neural correlates and time course of emotion in schizophrenia. This study used a well-validated affective picture viewing task that elicits a characteristic pattern of event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) from early to later processing stages (i.e., P1, P2, P3, and late positive potentials [LPPs]). Thirty-eight stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy controls viewed standardized pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures while ERPs were recorded and subsequently rated their emotional responses to the stimuli. Patients and controls responded to the pictures similarly in terms of their valence ratings, as well as the initial ERP components (P1, P2, and P3). However, at the later LPP component (500-1,000 ms), patients displayed diminished electrophysiological discrimination between pleasant versus neutral stimuli. This pattern suggests that patients demonstrated normal self-reported emotional experience and intact initial sensory processing of and resource allocation to emotional stimuli. However, they showed a disruption in a later component associated with sustained attentional processing of emotional stimuli.",M1
20138120,"Prosody-syntax interactions in aging: event-related potentials reveal dissociations between on-line and off-line measures.This study used <e>ERPs</e> to determine whether older adults use prosody in resolving early and late closure ambiguities comparably to young adults. Participants made off-line acceptability judgments on well-formed sentences or those containing prosody-syntax mismatches. Behaviorally, both groups identified mismatches, but older subjects accepted mismatches significantly more often than younger participants. ERP results demonstrate CPS components and garden-path effects (P600s) in both groups, however, older adults displayed no N400 and more anterior P600 components. The data provide the first electrophysiological evidence suggesting that older adults process and integrate prosodic information in real-time, despite off-line behavioral differences. Age-related differences in neurocognitive processing mechanisms likely contribute to this dissociation.",M1
20136734,"Ingroup categorization and response conflict: Interactive effects of target race, flanker compatibility, and infrequency on N2 amplitude.Three largely independent lines of research have investigated experimental manipulations that influence the amplitude of the N2 component of the event-related brain potential (<e>ERP</e>), one linking heightened N2 amplitude to response conflict, another showing that N2 is sensitive to stimulus infrequency, and the third showing larger N2 amplitude during categorization of racial ingroup relative to racial outgroup targets. The purpose of this research was to investigate potential interactions between these three features on the amplitude of the N2. ERPs were recorded while participants completed a modified flanker task using pictures of ingroup and outgroup faces. Results showed a 3-way interaction, indicating that the N2 was largest for ingroup targets on high-conflict trials but only when such trials were relatively infrequent. Implications of these findings for theories of both conflict monitoring and person perception are discussed.",M1
20125053,"Processes contributing to forward and backward span: an <e>ERP</e> investigation.Reversal of the order in which items are recalled reduces verbal span more than visuospatial span. We investigated behavioral performance and event-related potential components elicited during novel recognition span tasks with verbal (digits) and visuospatial (blocks) stimuli. Reversing item order reduced behavioral span and the amplitudes of the P3a and P3b event-related potential components in the verbal but not in the visuospatial tasks. P3a is thought to reflect detection of deviance from expectation, and hence the smaller P3a suggests expectancy of the stimulus sequence is attenuated in the digits backward task. P3b is thought to reflect allocation of attention to updating memory representations, hence the smaller P3b suggests attenuation of these attentional resources when the demanding operation of verbal order reversal is required in the digits backward span task.",M1
20123120,"A comparison of auditory evoked potentials to acoustic beats and to binaural beats.The purpose of this study was to compare cortical brain responses evoked by amplitude modulated acoustic beats of 3 and 6 Hz in tones of 250 and 1000 Hz with those evoked by their binaural beats counterparts in unmodulated tones to indicate whether the cortical processes involved differ. Event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) were recorded to 3- and 6-Hz acoustic and binaural beats in 2000 ms duration 250 and 1000 Hz tones presented with approximately 1 s intervals. Latency, amplitude and source current density estimates of ERP components to beats-evoked oscillations were determined and compared across beat types, beat frequencies and base (carrier) frequencies. All stimuli evoked tone-onset components followed by oscillations corresponding to the beat frequency, and a subsequent tone-offset complex. Beats-evoked oscillations were higher in amplitude in response to acoustic than to binaural beats, to 250 than to 1000 Hz base frequency and to 3 Hz than to 6 Hz beat frequency. Sources of the beats-evoked oscillations across all stimulus conditions located mostly to left temporal lobe areas. Differences between estimated sources of potentials to acoustic and binaural beats were not significant. The perceptions of binaural beats involve cortical activity that is not different than acoustic beats in distribution and in the effects of beat- and base frequency, indicating similar cortical processing.",M1
20123028,"The spatial and temporal dynamics of anticipatory preparation and response inhibition in task-switching.We investigated <e>ERP</e> and fMRI correlates of anticipatory preparation and response inhibition in a cued task-switching paradigm with informatively cued, non-informatively cued and no-go trials. Cue-locked ERPs showed evidence for a multicomponent preparation process. An early cue-locked differential positivity was larger for informative vs. non-informative cues and its amplitude correlated with differential activity for informatively vs. non-informatively cued trials in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), consistent with a goal activation process. A later differential positivity was larger for informatively cued switch vs. repeat trials and its amplitude correlated with informatively cued switch vs. repeat activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), compatible with a category-response (C-R) rule activation process. No-go trials elicited a frontal P3, whose amplitude was negatively correlated with activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and basal ganglia motor network, suggesting that a network responsible for response execution was inhibited in the course of a no-go trial. These findings indicate that anticipatory preparation in task-switching is comprised of at least two processes: goal activation and C-R rule activation. They also support a functional dissociation between DLPFC and VLPFC, with the former involved in top-down biasing and the latter involved in response inhibition.",M1
20121302,"Masked priming from orthographic neighbors: an <e>ERP</e> investigation.Two experiments combined masked priming with event-related potential (ERP) recordings to examine effects of primes that are orthographic neighbors of target words. Experiment 1 compared effects of repetition primes with effects of primes that were high-frequency orthographic neighbors of low-frequency targets (e.g., faute-faune [error-wildlife]), and Experiment 2 compared the same word neighbor primes with nonword neighbor primes (e.g., aujel-autel [altar]). Word neighbor primes showed the standard inhibitory priming effect in lexical decision latencies that sharply contrasted with the facilitatory effects of nonword neighbor primes. This contrast was most evident in the ERP signal starting at around 300 ms posttarget onset and continuing through the bulk of the N400 component. In this time window, repetition primes and nonword neighbor primes generated more positive-going waveforms than unrelated primes, whereas word neighbor primes produced null effects. The results are discussed with respect to possible mechanisms of lexical competition during visual word recognition.",M1
20121040,"Event-related potentials reflecting the processing of phonological constraint violations.How are violations of phonological constraints processed in word comprehension? The present article reports the results of an event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) study on a phonological constraint of German that disallows identical segments within a syllable or word (CC(i)VC(i)). We examined three types of monosyllabic late positive CCVC words: (a) existing words [see text], (b) wellformed novel words [see text] and component (c) illformed novel words [see text] as instances of Obligatory Contour Principle non-word (OCP) violations. Wellformed and illformed novel words evoked an N400 effect processing in comparison to existing words. In addition, illformed words produced an enhanced late posterior positivity effect compared to wellformed novel words. obligatory contour Our findings support the well-known observation that novel words evoke principle higher costs in lexical integration (reflected by N400 effects). Crucially, modulations of a late positive component (LPC) show that violations of phonological phonotactic constraints influence later stages of cognitive processing even constraints when stimuli have already been detected as non-existing. Thus, the comparison of electrophysiological effects evoked by the two types of non-existing words reveals the stages at which phonologically based structural wellformedness comes into play during word processing.",M1
20116436,"Neural components underlying subjective preferential decision making.The objectives of the current study were twofold: (i) to investigate the neural precursors of the formation of a subjective preference of facial stimuli, and (ii) to characterize the spatiotemporal brain activity patterns distinguishing between preferred and non-preferred faces. Multivariate EEG signals were recorded while participants made preference decisions, based on approachability, between two faces presented sequentially with unrestricted viewing time; the decision being made after presentation of the second face. The paired faces were similar in their physical properties, emphasizing the role of the subjective experience of the participants in making the decisions. EEG signals were analyzed in terms of event-related-potential (<e>ERP</e>) components and wavelet-based time-frequency-representations (TFR). The behavioural data showed that the presentation order and the exposure duration did not influence preference formation. The EEG data showed three effects. The earliest effect, the sustained posterior ERP positivity for preferred first faces as compared to non-preferred first faces, was found following the onset of the first face, and this was interpreted as the formation of a positive first impression of the first face. The two later effects following the second faces were an increase of frontal theta band oscillations around 500 ms for preferred second faces and of posterior gamma band oscillations around 650 ms for preferred first faces; both of which were interpreted as being related to the formation of a preference. All of these effects occurred well before the moment of conscious decision, thereby suggesting the implicitness of these neurally identifiable components.",M1
20116292,"ADHD children outperform normal children in an artificial grammar Implicit learning task: <e>ERP</e> and RT evidence.This study focuses on Implicit learning (IL) in children. One of the main debates in this field concerns the occurrence of IL indicators in experimental settings and its manifestation in different populations. In this research, we are looking for evidence of the occurrence of IL in normal children and in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), based on the relationship between accuracy, reaction time and event-related potentials (ERPs). Our results show differences between the analyzed groups with respect to markers for electrophysiological activity and reaction time, but not for accuracy. In consequence, we suggest that research in IL should explore different indicators and their relationship with the cognitive processing levels involved. In addition, IL might involve different forms of information processing in normal children and children with ADHD. We discuss the possible impact of these findings for future research.",M1
20109502,"Attentional bias to negative emotion as a function of approach and withdrawal anger styles: an <e>ERP</e> investigation.Although models of emotion have focused on the relationship between anger and approach motivation associated with aggression, anger is also related to withdrawal motivation. Anger-out and anger-in styles are associated with psychopathology and may disrupt the control of attention within the context of negatively valenced information. The present study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine whether anger styles uniquely predict attentional bias to negative stimuli during an emotion-word Stroop task. High anger-out predicted larger N200, P300, and N400 to negative words, suggesting that aggressive individuals exert more effort to override attention to negative information. In contrast, high anger-in predicted smaller N400 amplitude to negative words, indicating that negative information may be readily available (primed) for anger suppressors, requiring fewer resources. Individuals with an anger-out style might benefit from being directed away from provocative stimuli that might otherwise consume their attention and foster overt aggression. Findings indicating that anger-out and anger-in were associated with divergent patterns of brain activity provide support for distinguishing approach- and withdrawal-related anger styles.",M1
20105450,"Spectra-temporal patterns underlying mental addition: an <e>ERP</e> and ERD/ERS study.Functional neuroimaging data have shown that mental calculation involves fronto-parietal areas that are composed of different subsystems shared with other cognitive functions such as working memory and language. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis has also indicated sequential information changes during the calculation process. However, little is known about the dynamic properties of oscillatory networks in this process. In the present study, we applied both ERP and event-related (de-)synchronization (ERS/ERD) analyses to EEG data recorded from normal human subjects performing tasks for sequential visual/auditory mental addition. Results in the study indicate that the late positive components (LPCs) can be decomposed into two separate parts. The earlier element LPC1 (around 360ms) reflects the computing attribute and is more prominent in calculation tasks. The later element LPC2 (around 590ms) indicates an effect of number size and appears larger only in a more complex 2-digit addition task. The theta ERS and alpha ERD show modality-independent frontal and parietal differential patterns between the mental addition and control groups, and discrepancies are noted in the beta ERD between the 2-digit and 1-digit mental addition groups. The 2-digit addition (both visual and auditory) results in similar beta ERD patterns to the auditory control, which may indicate a reliance on auditory-related resources in mental arithmetic, especially with increasing task difficulty. These results coincide with the theory of simple calculation relying on the visuospatial process and complex calculation depending on the phonological process.",M1
20102535,"An <e>ERP</e> study of age-related differences in the central cost of interlimb coordination.The study investigated event-related EEG potentials during concurrent performance of interlimb coordination and visual oddball tasks by younger and older adults. Coordination task difficulty was equated between age groups by allowing participants to perform the task at self-determined frequencies. The amplitude of the P3b component of the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by visual task targets showed a different pattern across midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz) for younger and older adults. While younger adults showed a parietal maximum, P3b amplitudes in older adults did not differ across midline site, with lower amplitudes at central and parietal sites than younger adults but higher amplitude at the frontal site. Younger adults also had significantly shorter P3b latency than older adults. The results suggest that older adults may rely more on cognitive control of their movements than younger adults.",M1
20102534,"Orthographic and associative neighborhood density effects: what is shared, what is different?Words with many orthographic neighbors elicit a larger N400 than words with few orthographic neighbors. This has been interpreted as stronger overall semantic activation due to orthographic neighbors activating their semantic representations. To investigate this claim, we manipulated the number of associates of words (NoA), a variable directly affecting overall semantic activation, and compared this to the <e>ERP</e> effect of the number of orthographic neighbors (N) in a lexical decision task. Words with high NoA and with high N produced a very similar increase of the N400. In addition, a higher N increased the amplitude of the Late Positive Complex. The common N400 effect suggests that N affects semantic activation, like NoA does. The late positive effect specific to N could occur because words with few orthographic neighbors initially elicit little activity in the orthographic system, thereby resembling nonwords, which leads to distinct processing.",M1
20100584,"Multi-set canonical correlation analysis for the fusion of concurrent single trial <e>ERP</e> and functional MRI.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and electroencephalography (EEG) data provide complementary spatio-temporal information about brain function. Methods to couple the relative strengths of these modalities usually involve two stages: first forming a feature set from each dataset based on one criterion followed by exploration of connections among the features using a second criterion. We propose a data fusion method for simultaneously acquired fMRI and EEG data that combines these steps using a single criterion for finding the cross-modality associations and performing source separation. Using multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA), we obtain a decomposition of the two modalities, into spatial maps for fMRI data and a corresponding temporal evolution for EEG data, based on trial-to-trial covariation across the two modalities. Additionally, the analysis is performed on data from a group of subjects in order to make group inferences about the covariation across modalities. Being multivariate, the proposed method facilitates the study of brain connectivity along with localization of brain function. M-CCA can be easily extended to incorporate different data types and additional modalities. We demonstrate the promise of the proposed method in finding covarying trial-to-trial amplitude modulations (AMs) in an auditory task involving implicit pattern learning. The results show approximately linear decreasing trends in AMs for both modalities and the corresponding spatial activations occur mainly in motor, frontal, temporal, inferior parietal, and orbito-frontal areas that are linked both to sensory function as well as learning and expectation--all of which match activations related to the presented paradigm.",M1
20097609,"Effect of the static magnetic field of the MR-scanner on <e>ERPs</e>: evaluation of visual, cognitive and motor potentials.OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the influence of the static magnetic field of the MR-scanner on ERPs extracted from simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. The quality of the ERPs after BallistoCardioGraphic (BCG) artifact removal, as well as the reproducibility of the waveforms in different environments is investigated. METHODS: We consider a Detection, a Go-Nogo and a Motor task, eliciting peaks that differ in amplitude, latency and scalp topography, repeated in two situations: outside the scanner room (0T) and inside the MR-scanner but without gradients (3T). The BCG artifact is removed by means of three techniques: the Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS) method, the Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method and the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) approach. RESULTS: The performance of the three methods depends on the amount of averaged trials. Moreover, differences are found on both amplitude and latency of ERP components recorded in two environments (0T vs 3T). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that, while ERPs can be extracted from simultaneous EEG-fMRI data at 3T, the static magnetic field might affect the physiological processes under investigation. SIGNIFICANCE: The reproducibility of the ERPs in different recording environments (0T vs 3T) is a relevant issue that deserves further investigation to clarify the equivalence of cognitive processes in both behavioral and imaging studies.",M1
20096982,"<e>ERP</e> correlates of target-distracter differentiation in repeated runs of a continuous recognition task with emotional and neutral faces.The emotional salience of faces has previously been shown to induce memory distortions in recognition memory tasks. This event-related potential (ERP) study used repeated runs of a continuous recognition task with emotional and neutral faces to investigate emotion-induced memory distortions. In the second and third runs, participants made more false alarms to distracters (repeated from previous runs). Emotion did not modulate the amount of errors, but the extent to which recollection was employed to maximise performance as reflected in the putative ERP correlate of recollection; the parietal old-new effect. Targets from all stimulus classes (positive, negative, neutral) were associated with parietal ERP memory effects, but this was also the case for correctly rejected negative distracters. This suggests that recollection was strategically used to correctly reject negative distracters (recall-to-reject). This finding is consistent with the view that facilitated recollection of negative stimuli may be used to decrease the susceptibility to memory errors induced by emotional salience.",M1
20080194,"Physicians down-regulate their pain empathy response: an event-related brain potential study.Watching or imagining other people experiencing pain activates the central nervous system's pain matrix in the observer. Without emotion regulation skills, repeated exposure to the suffering of others in healthcare professionals may be associated with the adverse consequences of personal distress, burnout and compassion fatigue, which are detrimental to their wellbeing. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) from physicians and matched controls as they were presented with visual stimuli depicting body parts pricked by a needle (pain) or touched by a Q-tip (no-pain). The results showed early N110 differentiation between pain and no-pain over the frontal area as well as late P3 over the centro-parietal regions were observed in the control participants. In contrast, no such early and late ERP responses were detected in the physicians. Our results indicate that emotion regulation in physicians has very early effects, inhibiting the bottom-up processing of the perception of pain in others. It is suggested that physicians' down-regulation of the pain response dampens their negative arousal in response to the pain of others and thus may have many beneficial consequences including freeing up cognitive resources necessary for being of assistance.",M1
20079804,"Gesture influences the processing of figurative language in non-native speakers: <e>ERP</e> evidence.Gestures should play a role in second language comprehension, given their importance in conveying contextual information. In this study, the N400 and the LPC were evaluated in a task involving the observation of videos showing utterances accompanied by gestures. Students studying advanced (G-High participants) and basic German (G-Low participants) as a second language were investigated. The utterance-gesture congruence and metaphoric meaning of content were manipulated during the task. As in previous ERP reports with native speakers, metaphorical expressions were sensitive to gestures. In G-Low participants, no modulation in the 300-500 ms window was observed, and only a modest effect was observed for the 500-700 ms window. More subtle differences of verbal expression were not processed in this group. Consistent with previous reports of the same paradigm with native speakers, the N400 from G-High group discriminated both congruent and incongruent gestures as well as literal and metaphorical sentences. Our results suggest that semantic processing is robust in the learning of a second language, although the amplitude modulation and latency of ERPs might depend on the speaker's proficiency level.",M1
20079772,"Emotional modulation of the late positive potential (LPP) generalizes to Chinese individuals.Late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) component involved in emotional processing that has been consistently observed in Caucasians. Previous studies have demonstrated that emotionally arousing pictures typically elicit larger LPPs than neutral pictures. In the present study, we examined whether the emotional content effect on LPPs generalizes to Chinese individuals. Brain potentials were recorded from participants viewing both emotional and neutral pictures from the international affective picture system (IAPS). Our results showed greater LPPs for emotional than for neutral pictures. The effects of both pleasant and unpleasant pictures appeared relatively early, and lasted for up to 6s. In addition, subjective ratings for picture arousal correlated strongly with corresponding LPP amplitudes. These results replicate previous findings in Caucasians, and suggest that the emotion processes underlying the LPP are more universal than cultural-specific in nature.",M1
20079389,"Flanker negative priming from spatially unpredictable primes: an <e>ERP</e> study.In a typical flanker task, a to-be-selected central target is flanked by two to-be ignored, identical distractors. The flanker negative priming (NP) effect denotes increased reaction time and error percent when the distractor of a first display serves as the target in the next. Most theories of NP are consistent with the idea that during processing of the first display, the identity of the distractors is inhibited. If the target of the subsequent display has the same identity, NP occurs because of persisting or retrieved inhibition. However, in the standard flanker task stimuli appear at the same screen locations for all trials, allowing for anticipatory spatial selection. No strong additional inhibition of stimulus identities may then be required. Therefore, besides the standard flanker task we employed a modified task in which the location of the stimulus triplet slightly differed across trials, thus disabling spatial pre-selection. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to identify brain correlates of NP in the two tasks. Behavioral NP was present in the modified task but absent in the standard task. An ERP correlate specific to NP in the modified task concerned larger amplitude of a left-posterior processing negativity. Results support the idea that stronger inhibition of distractor identities contributes to NP in the flanker task when spatial pre-selection is disabled.",M1
20071631,"Neural correlates of sequence encoding in visuomotor learning.To examine the neural basis of sequence learning, a fundamental but poorly understood human ability, we recorded event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) while subjects viewed and memorized randomly directed sequences of motions for later imitation. Previously, we found that the amplitude of ERPs elicited by successive motion segments decreased as a function of each segment's serial position. This happened when subjects were required to remember the sequence, but not when they were performing a perceptual task. Here, to study the functional significance of this amplitude gradient in sequence learning, we presented each sequence several times in succession and examined changes in ERP amplitude as subjects learned the sequence through repeated observation and imitation. Behaviorally, with each repetition subjects grew more accurate in reproducing what they had seen. At the same time, ERPs grew smaller with each successive presentation, replicating and extending previous demonstrations of repetition suppression. Importantly, a comparison of ERPs to segments occupying different serial positions within a sequence revealed a decreasing amplitude gradient that grew steeper with sequence repetition. This sharpening of the amplitude gradient may reflect an explicit encoding process that relies on a magnitude code for serial order.",M1
20071626,"Retention interval affects visual short-term memory encoding.Humans can efficiently store fine-detailed facial emotional information in visual short-term memory for several seconds. However, an unresolved question is whether the same neural mechanisms underlie high-fidelity short-term memory for emotional expressions at different retention intervals. Here we show that retention interval affects the neural processes of short-term memory encoding using a delayed facial emotion discrimination task. The early sensory P100 component of the event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) was larger in the 1-s interstimulus interval (ISI) condition than in the 6-s ISI condition, whereas the face-specific N170 component was larger in the longer ISI condition. Furthermore, the memory-related late P3b component of the ERP responses was also modulated by retention interval: it was reduced in the 1-s ISI as compared with the 6-s condition. The present findings cannot be explained based on differences in sensory processing demands or overall task difficulty because there was no difference in the stimulus information and subjects' performance between the two different ISI conditions. These results reveal that encoding processes underlying high-precision short-term memory for facial emotional expressions are modulated depending on whether information has to be stored for one or for several seconds.",M1
20070576,"Reaction-time binning: a simple method for increasing the resolving power of <e>ERP</e> averages.Stimulus-locked, response-locked, and ERP-locked averaging are effective methods for reducing artifacts in ERP analysis. However, they suffer from a magnifying-glass effect: they increase the resolution of specific ERPs at the cost of blurring other ERPs. Here we propose an extremely simple technique-binning trials based on response times and then averaging-which can significantly alleviate the problems of other averaging methods. We have empirically evaluated the technique in an experiment where the task requires detecting a target in the presence of distractors. We have also studied the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of averages with and without binning. Results indicate that the method produces clearer representations of ERPs than either stimulus-locked and response-locked averaging, revealing finer details of ERPs and helping in the evaluation of the amplitude and latency of ERP waves. The method is applicable to within-subject and between-subject averages.",M1
20070574,"On the role of conflict and control in social cognition: event-related brain potential investigations.Numerous social-cognitive models posit that social behavior largely is driven by links between constructs in long-term memory that automatically become activated when relevant stimuli are encountered.

This article reviews event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) studies investigating the role played by cognitive control and conflict resolution processes in social-cognitive phenomena typically deemed automatic. Neurocognitive responses associated with response activation and conflict often are sensitive to the same stimulus manipulations that produce differential behavioral responses on social-cognitive tasks and that often are attributed to the role of automatic associations.

In addition, no neuroimaging studies that identify this phenomenon have been conducted. Therefore, we used event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) measures to investigate this phenomenon by comparing the ERPs elicited by the audiovisual stimuli to the sum of the ERPs elicited by the visual and auditory stimuli, and identified two brain regions that showed significantly different responses: the centro-medial area at 280-300 ms after the presentation of the stimulus and the right fronto-temporal area at 300-320 ms after the presentation of the stimulus. The ERP results suggested that the behavioral enhancement of auditory detection results from late-stage cognitive processes rather than early-stage sensory processes.",M1
20064584,"The relationship between performance monitoring, satisfaction with life, and positive personality traits.Neural reflections of performance monitoring, including the error-related negativity (ERN) component of the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>), are modulated by personality and affective constructs. Little is known, however, about the relationship between positive personality traits and neural indices of performance monitoring. We investigated the relationship between measures of positive personality traits, including satisfaction with life, dispositional optimism, and positive affect, and indices of performance monitoring in a sample of 45 neurologically-healthy individuals. Increased satisfaction with life was associated with decreased (i.e., less negative) ERN amplitude. Dispositional optimism and positive affect were not related to ERN amplitude. Results remained consistent when negative affect and measures of positive personality were accounted for using multiple regression. There were no relationships between measures of positive personality and the post-error positivity (Pe) or behavioral indices. Findings are consistent with an affective salience interpretation of the ERN, with errors potentially being less meaningful for individuals with higher satisfaction with life.",M1
20063433,"Visual hallucinations and altered visual information processing in Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.Visual hallucinations (VHs) are common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), while auditory hallucinations are rare. To neurophysiologically investigate the pathophysiology of VHs in these disorders, we studied event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) of DLB, PDD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We compared visual and auditory ERP latencies among PDD patients with and without VHs (PDD-H: 11, PDD-N: 6), DLB patients (24), and AD patients (21). To elicit visual and auditory ERPs, a facial discrimination paradigm and a conventional auditory odd-ball paradigm, respectively, were used. The mean visual P3 latencies in the PDD-H and DLB groups were significantly longer than that in the AD group, while the mean auditory P3 latencies in all four patient groups were comparable. The mean visual P2 latencies in the PDD-N, PDD-H, and DLB groups were significantly longer than that in the control group. Our findings suggest that visual cognitive functions are selectively impaired in hallucinatory patients with DLB and PDD. VHs may be associated in part with predominant visual cognitive impairments attributable to PDD and DLB pathologies. Our findings also suggest that the impairments occur at the early stage of facial information processing.",M1
20059986,"An early parietal <e>ERP</e> component of the frontoparietal system: EDAN not = N2pc.Directing spatial attention or manual response selection by means of arrow cues elicits a characteristic sequence of lateralized ERP components. Van Velzen and Eimer (2003) proposed that one of these components, the EDAN (early directing-attention negativity) is not related to the control of spatial attention but is instead an N2pc in disguise, related to the visual processing of arrow cues. While this proposal seems widely accepted, it has never been evaluated whether the hitherto not well-determined scalp distribution of the EDAN matches the well-established scalp distribution of the N2pc. This paper reviews evidence from earlier published work supporting a parietal distribution of the EDAN. This strongly argues against the proposed identification with the N2pc. The EDAN may instead reflect early parietal activity within the frontoparietal network, preceding the frontal activation represented in the anterior directing-attention negativity (ADAN).",M1
20051237,"Event-related potential correlates of item and source memory strength.Event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) studies of recognition memory have shown dissociations between item recognition and source memory, wherein item recognition is associated with the mid-frontal FN400 component, which varies continuously with item memory strength, while source memory is associated with the late parietal effect (LPC). There is current debate about whether source memory can vary along a continuum of memory strength or is a threshold process. The LPC has been shown to be generally sensitive to correct versus incorrect source judgments, but varying levels of  source strength  along a single dimension of source evidence have not been tested. The current experiment had participants encode novel visual objects in one of two different task contexts by performing either a conceptual or perceptual judgment about the object. On a subsequent memory test, participants made an old/new decision on a 4-point confidence scale followed by a source memory confidence judgment, in which they indicated their confidence about which task they had performed with the object at encoding. ERPs from the memory test were examined for electrophysiological correlates of both item and source memory strength. Item memory was associated with differences in the 300-500 ms time window, consistent with the timing of the FN400. Differences in the amplitude of the LPC were observed between correct and incorrect source decisions, consistent with previous findings. Comparing low and high confidence source decisions also revealed differences, suggesting that the LPC is also sensitive to variations in the strength of source memory.",M1
20051232,"Dissociation of the electrophysiological correlates of familiarity strength and item repetition.Event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) were employed to investigate the relationship between the familiarity strength of recognition memory test items (pictures of animate and inanimate objects) and a putative ERP correlate of familiarity, the mid-frontal 'old/new' effect. A modified Remember/Know task was used in which subjects endorsed items as 'remembered' if any detail of the study presentation could be retrieved and, if not, judged the old/new status of the item using a 4-point confidence scale ('confident old' to 'confident new'). Studied test items elicited a mid-frontal old/new effect that varied according to the rated familiarity of the eliciting item. Thus, prior findings that the mid-frontal effect is graded according to familiarity strength are not attributable to the confounding influence of study status, as has been suggested. ERPs elicited by studied and unstudied items that were rated equally familiar differed in the same latency range as that occupied by the mid-frontal old/new effect. Furthermore, the scalp topography of this repetition effect differed significantly from the topography of the mid-frontal effect. The findings suggest that ERPs elicited by recognition memory test items are modulated during the 300-500 ms latency range both by the familiarity strength of the item and, separately, by an implicit memory process that acts independently of the processes supporting familiarity-driven recognition judgments.",M1
20045677,"Human visual system automatically represents large-scale sequential regularities.Our brain recordings reveal that large-scale sequential regularities defined across non-adjacent stimuli can be automatically represented in visual sensory memory. To show that, we adopted an auditory paradigm developed by Sussman, E., Ritter, W., and Vaughan, H. G. Jr. (1998). Predictability of stimulus deviance and the mismatch negativity.

NeuroReport, 16, 1519-1523 to the visual domain by presenting task-irrelevant infrequent luminance-deviant stimuli (D, 20%) inserted among task-irrelevant frequent stimuli being of standard luminance (S, 80%) in randomized (randomized condition, SSSDSSSSSDSSSSD...) and fixed manners (fixed condition, SSSSDSSSSDSSSSD...). Comparing the visual mismatch negativity (visual MMN), an event-related brain potential (<e>ERP</e>) index of memory-mismatch processes in human visual sensory system, revealed that visual MMN elicited by deviant stimuli was reduced in the fixed compared to the randomized condition. Thus, the large-scale sequential regularity being present in the fixed condition (SSSSD) must have been represented in visual sensory memory. Interestingly, this effect did not occur in conditions with stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 480 and 800 ms but was confined to the 160-ms SOA condition supporting the hypothesis that large-scale regularity extraction was based on perceptual grouping of the five successive stimuli defining the regularity.",M1
20043199,"Are females more responsive to emotional stimuli? A neurophysiological study across arousal and valence dimensions.Men and women seem to process emotions and react to them differently. Yet, few neurophysiological studies have systematically investigated gender differences in emotional processing. Here, we studied gender differences using Event Related Potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) and Skin Conductance Responses (SCR) recorded from participants who passively viewed emotional pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The arousal and valence dimension of the stimuli were manipulated orthogonally. The peak amplitude and peak latency of ERP components and SCR were analyzed separately, and the scalp topographies of significant ERP differences were documented. Females responded with enhanced negative components (N100 and N200), in comparison to males, especially to the unpleasant visual stimuli, whereas both genders responded faster to high arousing or unpleasant stimuli. Scalp topographies revealed more pronounced gender differences on central and left hemisphere areas. Our results suggest a difference in the way emotional stimuli are processed by genders: unpleasant and high arousing stimuli evoke greater ERP amplitudes in women relatively to men. It also seems that unpleasant or high arousing stimuli are temporally prioritized during visual processing by both genders.",M1
20035885,"The time course of activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex during top-down attentional control.A network of brain regions has been implicated in top-down attentional control, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The present experiment evaluated predictions of the cascade-of-control model (Banich, 2009), which predicts that during attentionally-demanding tasks, LDLPFC imposes a top-down attentional set which precedes late-stage selection performed by dACC. Furthermore, the cascade-of-control model argues that dACC must increase its activity to compensate when top-down control by LDLPFC is poor. The present study tested these hypotheses using fMRI and dense-array <e>ERP</e> data collected from the same 80 participants in separate sessions. fMRI results guided ERP source modeling to characterize the time course of activity in LDLPFC and dACC. As predicted, dACC activity subsequent to LDLPFC activity distinguished congruent and incongruent conditions on the Stroop task. Furthermore, when LDLPFC activity was low, the level of dACC activity was related to performance outcome. These results demonstrate that dACC responds to attentional demand in a flexible manner that is dependent on the level of LDLPFC activity earlier in a trial. Overall, results were consistent with the temporal course of regional brain function proposed by the cascade-of-control model.",M1

20030764,"Empathy and error processing.Recent research suggests a relationship between empathy and error processing. Error processing is an evaluative control function that can be measured using post-error response time slowing and the error-related negativity (ERN) and post-error positivity (Pe) components of the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>). Thirty healthy participants completed two measures of empathy, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ), and a modified Stroop task. Post-error slowing was associated with increased empathic personal distress on the IRI. ERN amplitude was related to overall empathy score on the EQ and the fantasy subscale of the IRI. The Pe and measures of empathy were not related. Results remained consistent when negative affect was controlled via partial correlation, with an additional relationship between ERN amplitude and empathic concern on the IRI. Findings support a connection between empathy and error processing mechanisms.",M1
20030761,"<e>ERP</e> correlates of linear hand movements in a motor reproduction task.Blindfolded participants performed one-dimensional movements towards a mechanical stop and back to the start. After a varying delay, they had to reproduce the encoded target position by a second mechanically unrestricted movement. Average event-related potentials accompanying the  encoding  and the  reproduction  movements revealed a biphasic waveshape over primary sensorimotor areas. The first negative deflection was the gradually increasing motor potential (MP) that precedes movement onset. This was followed by a second negative component (N4) starting about 100 ms after movement onset. Its amplitude and latency increased with increasing movement distance and reached its maximum in unrestricted movements (i.e., during reproduction) shortly before the deceleration peak. These results show that rapid hand movements are accompanied by non-continuous and highly distance specific activity changes measured over the sensorimotor cortex.",M1
20030759,"Unexpected action effects elicit deviance-related brain potentials and cause behavioral delay.To examine how people deal with perceivable consequences of their voluntary actions, we recorded event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) during a self-paced, two-choice random generation task. Sixteen participants were asked to press one of two buttons randomly at a regular but self-selected interval of once per 1-2 s. Each button press produced either a 1000-Hz or 2000-Hz tone, but participants were told that the tones were irrelevant to the task. The button-tone combinations were initially fixed, but in subsequent blocks, a button press infrequently produced the tone associated with the opposite button (p=.15). This cognitively mismatched tone elicited N2, P3, and late positive potential (or positive slow wave) of the ERP and delayed the timing of the next button press. These results suggest that action effects are difficult to ignore and that an action effect that is different from a performer's expectation may cause task disruption.",M1
20026380,"Electrophysiological evidence for effects of color knowledge in object recognition.Knowledge about the typical colors associated with familiar everyday objects (i.e., strawberries are red) is well-known to be represented in the conceptual semantic system. Evidence that such knowledge may also play a role in early perceptual processes for object recognition is scant. In the present <e>ERP</e> study, participants viewed a list of object pictures and detected infrequent stimulus repetitions. Results show that shortly after stimulus onset, ERP components indexing early perceptual processes, including N1, P2, and N2, differentiated between objects in their appropriate or congruent color from these objects in an inappropriate or incongruent color. Such congruence effect also occurred in N3 associated with semantic processing of pictures but not in N4 for domain-general semantic processing. Our results demonstrate a clear effect of color knowledge in early object recognition stages and support the following proposal-color as a surface property is stored in a multiple-memory system where pre-semantic perceptual and semantic conceptual representations interact during object recognition.",M1
20026375,"Electrophysiological evidence of interaction between contextual expectation and semantic integration during the processing of collocations.Despite the potentially infinite creativity of language, many words are patterned in ordered strings called collocations. Final words of these clusters are highly predictable; in addition, their overall meaning can vary on the literality dimension, ranging from (figurative) idiomatic strings to literal strings. These structures thus offer a natural linguistic scenario to contrast <e>ERP</e> correlates of contextual expectation and semantic integration processes during comprehension. In this study, expected endings elicited a positive peak around 300ms compared to less expected synonyms, suggesting that the earlier recognition of the string leads to the specific pre-activation of the lexical items that conclude the expression. On the other hand, meaning variations of these fixed strings (either a literal or a figurative whole meaning) affected ERPs only around 400ms, i.e. in the frontal portion of the N400. These findings are discussed within a more general cognitive framework as outlined in Kok's (2001) dual categorization model.",M1
20026246,"The influence on cognitive processing from the switches of shooting angles in videos of real-world events: an <e>ERP</e> study.This work mainly focuses on the influence from switches of shooting angles in videos during the cognitive processing in the human brain. In the experiment we used the videos with switches of shooting angles as materials and compared the ERPs elicited by the switch frames and the non-switch frames in the videos, it was found that when subjects were asked to pay attention to the video contents, the switch frames would trigger P3a-RON waveforms, but no N400 waveform was found in the ERP results. This showed that when subjects were concerned with the video contents, the switches of shooting angles would distract their attention from the video contents, but as long as the semantic meaning of the videos were coherent, the switches of shooting angles would not lead to significant difficulties in semantic comprehension. At the same time, the experimental results also further proved that the P3a and RON generally reflect the processing of task-irrelevant visual stimuli.",M1
20026223,"Probability dependence and functional separation of the object-related and mismatch negativity event-related potential components.The separation of concurrently presented sounds into distinct auditory objects is accompanied by the elicitation of the object-related negativity (ORN) component of the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>). In the present study, participants were exposed to tone sequences containing not only concurrent (harmonicity), but also sequential cues (similarity to previous stimuli in the series) for auditory object formation. Although ORN was consistently elicited by two-object relative to one-object sounds, it was modulated by the presentation rate. With increasing probability of sound segregation, ORN amplitude decreased, and its scalp topography shifted from a bilateral towards a unilateral (left-hemispheric) activation pattern. Probability dependence of the ORN matches previous behavioral data. The differential sensitivity of the left- and right-hemispheric response to this manipulation may explain why an ORN probability effect was not obtained in previous electrophysiological studies. The specific functional role of ORN for concurrent sound perception was confirmed by dissociating it from the mismatch negativity (MMN) component as a correlate of processing sequential cues. ORN probability dependence is argued to be functionally relevant for the interaction of concurrent and sequential mechanisms of auditory scene analysis.",M1
20026179,"Perspective taking modulates event-related potentials to perceived pain.Recent event-related brain potential (<e>ERP</e>) study disentangled an early automatic component and a late top-down controlled component of neural activities to perceived pain of others. This study assessed the hypothesis that perspective taking modulates the top-down controlled component but not the automatic component of empathy for pain by recording ERPs from 24 subjects who performed pain judgments of pictures of hands in painful or non-painful situations from either self-perspective or other-perspective. We found that, relative to non-painful stimuli, painful stimuli induced positive shifts of ERPs at frontal-central electrodes as early as 160 ms after sensory stimulation and this effect lasted until 700 ms. The amplitudes of ERPs at 230-250 ms elicited by painful stimuli negatively correlated with both subjective ratings of others' pain and self-unpleasantness in both self-perspective and other-perspective conditions. Neural response to perceived pain over the central-parietal area was significantly reduced at 370-420 ms when performing the pain judgment task from other-perspective compared to self-perspective. The results suggest that shifting between self-perspectives and other-perspectives modulates the late controlled component but not the early automatic component of neural responses to perceived pain.",M1
20026133,"A Concealed Information Test with multimodal measurement.A Concealed Information Test (CIT) investigates differential physiological responses to deed-related (probe) vs. irrelevant items. The present study focused on the detection of concealed information using simultaneous recordings of autonomic and brain electrical measures. As a secondary issue, verbal and pictorial presentations were compared with respect to their influence on the recorded measures. Thirty-one participants underwent a mock-crime scenario with a combined verbal and pictorial presentation of nine items. The subsequent CIT, designed with respect to event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) measurement, used a 3-3.5s interstimulus interval. The item presentation modality, i.e. pictures or written words, was varied between subjects; no response was required from the participants. In addition to electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory activity, and finger plethysmogram were recorded. A significant probe-vs.-irrelevant effect was found for each of the measures. Compared to sole ERP measurement, the combination of ERP and EDA yielded incremental information for detecting concealed information. Although, EDA per se did not reach the predictive value known from studies primarily designed for peripheral physiological measurement. Presentation modality neither influenced the detection accuracy for autonomic measures nor EEG measures; this underpins the equivalence of verbal and pictorial item presentation in a CIT, regardless of the physiological measures recorded. Future studies should further clarify whether the incremental validity observed in the present study reflects a differential sensitivity of ERP and EDA to different sub-processes in a CIT.",M1

20006378,"Sentence integration processes: an <e>ERP</e> study of Chinese sentence comprehension with relative clauses.In an event-related potentials (ERPs) study, we examined the comprehension of different types of Chinese (Mandarin) relative clauses (object vs. subject-extracted) to test the universality and language specificity of sentence comprehension processes. Because Chinese lacks morphosyntactic cues to sentence constituent relations, it allows a test of the possibility that semantic-contextual processes dominate the extraction of clausal relations, in contrast to the structure-dependent processing in English and many other languages. ERP results at the RC embedded verbs showed a P600 effect for the subject-extraction type, reflecting a processing of phrasal reconfiguration, and an N400 effect for the object-extraction type, reflecting a processing of meaning reinterpretation. A central-frontal sustained negativity was produced by the RC head noun of object-extraction, suggesting a combined effect of meaning derivation and referents establishment. LORETA (Low Resolution Electrical Tomography) source localization showed activation of posterior dominance (e.g., BA 22/39/19/41/42) supporting the integration of structure mapping (P600) and meaning derivation (N400) in a developing sentential representation, consistent with the memory unification and control model (Hagoort, 2005). More left-lateralized anterior regions of a frontal-temporal network (e.g., BA 47/38) became active later in the sentence (a sustained central-frontal negativity), when the thematic-role specification for multiple referents may have required additional cognitive and memory resources. Our findings suggest that Chinese sentence reading recruits a neural network that is sensitive to the sequential/hierarchical organization of linguistic inputs in a manner that resembles to the structure-dependent cognitive processes in other languages, reflecting a universal property of language processing. The ERP data shows that early lexical processes are important in the integration process, but also challenges the view that Chinese text reading depends primarily on semantic-contextual processing in the derivation of meaning representation.",M1
20005297,"Unsupervised statistical learning underpins computational, behavioural, and neural manifestations of musical expectation.The ability to anticipate forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative <e>ERP</e> component at a late time period (400-450 ms), (ii) beta band (14-30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions.

20004251,"Perceiving the writing sequence of Chinese characters: an <e>ERP</e> investigation.The neural dynamics in perceiving well-learned sequences and its modulation by task demand were investigated in this study in which participants were asked to observe stroke-by-stroke display of Chinese characters composed of two radicals while their brain activity was monitored with the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Experiment 1 used an accuracy judgment task that would draw participants' attention to the violation of the writing sequence whereas Experiment 2 required participants to judge the completion of the display and thus the more automatic aspects of sequence processing could be revealed. In Experiment 1, the within-radical boundary reversal produced bilateral posterior N2 enhancement and the cross-boundary reversal elicited a left N2 effect and right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Both types of reversal elicited P3 effects on the critical stroke and sustained negativity effects on the following stroke, with the size being larger for the cross-boundary reversal. In Experiment 2, in addition to the P3 effects, the within-boundary reversal elicited a left posterior N2 effect and the cross-boundary reversal elicited right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Moreover, on the following stroke, the cross-boundary reversal elicited a right N2 effect and both types of reversal elicited sustained positivity effects. These findings demonstrate that native Chinese readers use their sequential knowledge to predict upcoming strokes in perceiving the writing of characters and to construct appropriate representations for the action sequence regardless of whether such predictions and constructions are required by the task.",M1
20004221,"Neurocognitive mechanisms of conceptual processing in healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia.This overview outlines findings of cognitive and neurocognitive studies on comprehension of verbal, pictorial, and video stimuli in healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia. We present evidence for a distinction between two complementary neurocognitive streams of conceptual analysis during comprehension. In familiar situations, adequate understanding of events may be achieved by mapping the perceived information on the associative and similarity-based connections between concepts in semantic memory - a process reflected by an N400 waveform of event-related electrophysiological potentials (<e>ERPs</e>). However, in less conventional contexts, a more flexible mechanism may be needed. We suggest that this alternative processing stream, reflected by a P600 ERP waveform, may use discrete, rule-like goal-related requirements of real-world actions to comprehend relationships between perceived people, objects, and actions. This neurocognitive model of comprehension is used as a basis in discussing studies in schizophrenia. These studies suggest an imbalanced engagement of the two conceptual streams in schizophrenia, whereby patients may rely on the associative and similarity-based networks in semantic memory even when it would be more adaptive to recruit mechanisms that draw upon goal-related requirements. Finally, we consider the roles that these conceptual mechanisms may play in real-life behavior, and the consequences that their dysfunction may have for disorganized behavior and inability to plan actions to achieve behavioral goals in schizophrenia.",M1

We also examined whether noninformative trials (i.e., delayed reconfiguration, no response inhibition) produce similar sequence effects. Participants switched using informative and noninformative cues (Experiment 2) intermixed with no-go trials (Experiment 1). Repeat RT was slower for both no-go/informative (pNG/I) and noninformative/informative (pNI/I) than informative/informative sequences. ERPs linked to anticipatory preparation showed no effect of trial sequence.

However, the scores resulting from this procedure require special adjustments for further analyses and do not directly reflect each participant's latency. Here, a simple transform is proposed that retrieves estimates of each participant's latency from the subaverage scores, rendering further adjustments superfluous. Other advantages of working with participants' latencies are discussed. Results of simulations support the validity of jackknifing and the retrieval transform.",M1
19995583,"Current source density (CSD) old/new effects during recognition memory for words and faces in schizophrenia and in healthy adults.We previously reported a preserved 'old-new effect' (enhanced parietal positivity 300-800 ms following correctly-recognized repeated words) in schizophrenia over mid-parietal sites using 31-channel nose-referenced event-related potentials (<e>ERP</e>) and reference-free current source densities (CSD). However, patients showed poorer word recognition memory and reduced left lateral-parietal P3 sources. The present study investigated whether these abnormalities are specific to words. High-density ERPs (67 channels) were recorded from 57 schizophrenic (24 females) and 44 healthy (26 females) right-handed adults during parallel visual continuous recognition memory tasks using common words or unknown faces. To identify and measure neuronal generator patterns underlying ERPs, unrestricted Varimax-PCA was performed using CSD estimates (spherical spline surface Laplacian). Two late source factors peaking at 442 ms (lateral parietal maximum) and 723 ms (centroparietal maximum) accounted for most of the variance between 250 and 850 ms. Poorer (76.6+/-20.0% vs. 85.7+/-12.4% correct) and slower (824+/-170 vs. 755+/-147 ms) performance in patients was accompanied by reduced stimulus-locked parietal sources. However, both controls and patients showed mid-frontal (442 ms) and left parietal (723 ms) old/new effects in both tasks. Whereas mid-frontal old/new effects were comparable across groups and tasks, later left parietal old/new effects were markedly reduced in patients over lateral temporoparietal but not mid-parietal sites, particularly for words, implicating impaired phonological processing. In agreement with prior results, ERP correlates of recognition memory deficits in schizophrenia suggest functional impairments of lateral posterior cortex (stimulus representation) associated with conscious recollection. This deficit was more pronounced for common words despite a greater difficulty to recall unknown faces, indicating that it is not due to a generalized cognitive deficit in schizophrenia.",M1
19995582,"Automatic semantic priming abnormalities in schizophrenia.Abnormal activation of semantic networks characterizes schizophrenia and can be studied using the N400 event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>). N400 is elicited by words that are not primed by the preceding context and provides a direct measure of the neural mechanisms underlying semantic priming. Semantic priming refers to facilitated semantic processing gained through pre-exposure to semantic context, which can happen automatically if the interval between the prime and target is very short. We predicted that (1) schizophrenia patients have overly inclusive semantic networks, reflected in a less negative than expected N400 to relatively unprimed words, and (2) schizophrenia patients are deficient in their use of semantic context, responding to primed words as if they were unprimed, reflected in a more negative than expected N400 to primed words. N400s were acquired from patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (n=26) and age-matched healthy comparison subjects (n=29) performing a picture-word verification (match vs. non-match) task. Word targets were presented 325ms after a picture prime, which either matched (CAMEL--&gt; camel ), or did not match (In Category: CAMEL--&gt; cow ; Out Category: CAMEL--&gt; candle ) the prime. N400 data suggest that both patients and controls are sensitive to the difference between primed and unprimed words, but patients are less sensitive than controls. Similarly, N400 data suggest that both groups were sensitive to the subtler difference between classes of unprimed words (In Category versus Out Category picture-word non-matches), but patients are less sensitive, especially those with prominent negative symptoms.",M1

The discrimination thresholds of participants trained with the difficult task decreased after training, but thresholds of participants with the easy task did not. More importantly, although posterior N1 reduction and anterior P2 decrement were obtained in both conditions, only the difficult task training showed an enhancement in posterior P1, an increase in N2 and P3, and a broader scalp distribution of posterior N1 attenuation. These differences indicated that the difficult task training affected the early visual processing stage, the later ERP components, and the broader visual cortical regions, respectively. The results in the present study provide direct electrophysiological evidence for task difficulty modulation of perceptual learning-related neuroplasticity.",M1

Participants saw word pairs, and for each made a JOL indicating how confident they were that they would remember the pairing on a later cued recall task. ERPs were recorded while JOLs were made and were separated according to whether items were: (i) remembered or forgotten on the subsequent test, and (ii) rated likely or unlikely to be remembered. An early positive-going ERP effect was associated with both of these comparisons, whereas a later negative-going effect was present only in the separation based upon JOL ratings. ERP data therefore indicate that JOLs do not reduce to encoding processes that predict the accuracy of memory judgments.",M1
19965206,"<e>ERP</e> based decision fusion for AD diagnosis across cohorts.As the average life expectancy increases, particularly in developing countries, prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has also increased. This trend is especially alarming for Alzheimer's disease (AD); as there is no cure to stop or reverse the effects of AD. However, recent pharmacological advances can slow the progression of AD, but only if AD is diagnosed at early stages. We have previously introduced an ensemble of classifiers based approach for combining event related potentials obtained from different electrode locations as an effective approach for early diagnosis of AD. We further expand this approach and analyze its robustness and stability in two ways: comparing the diagnostic accuracy on hand selected and cleaned data vs. standard automated preprocessing, but more importantly, comparing the diagnostic accuracy on two different cohorts, whose data are collected under different settings: a research university lab and a community clinic.",M1
19964326,"Neurophysiology study of early visual processing of face and non-face recognition under simulated prosthetic vision.Behavioral researches have shown that the visual function can be partly restored by phosphene-based prosthetic vision for the non-congenital blinds. However, the early visual processing mechanisms of phosphene object recognition is still unclear. This paper aimed to investigate the electro-neurophysiology underlying the phosphene face and non-face recognition. The modulations of latency and amplitude of N170 component in the event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) were analyzed. Our preliminary results showed that (1) both normal and phosphene face stimuli could elicit prominent N170; nevertheless, phosphene stimuli caused notable latency delay and amplitude suppression on N170 compared with normal stimuli and (2) under phosphene non-face stimuli, a slight but significant latency delay occurred compared with normal stimuli, while amplitude suppression was not observed. Therefore, it was suggested that (1) phosphene perception caused a disruption of the early visual processing for non-canonical images of objects, which was more profound in phosphene face processing; (2) the face-specific processing was reserved under prosthetic vision and (3) holistic processing was the major stage in early visual processing of phosphene face recognition, while part-based processing was attenuated due to the loss of the details.",M1
19963674,"A new method for spatiotemporal identification of event-related potential subcomponents.In this study a novel method for tracking and separation of event-related potential (<e>ERP</e>) subcomponents from trial to trial is considered. The sources of ERP subcomponents are assumed to be electric current dipoles (ECD). The shape of each ERP subcomponent is also supposed to be monophasic wave and modeled using a Gaussian waveform. We are interested in the estimation and tracking of ERP subcomponent locations and parameters (amplitude, latency and width of each Gaussian waveform). Estimation of ECD locations, which have nonlinear relation to the measurement, is performed by particle filtering, and estimation of the amplitude is optimally estimated by a maximum likelihood approach, and finally estimation of latency and width of the Gaussian functions are given by Newton-Raphson technique. New recursive methods are introduced for both maximum likelihood and Newton-Raphson approaches to prevent the divergence of the filtering in the presence of very low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method was assessed using both simulated and real data and the results verified a successful deployment of the method in ERP analysis.",M1
19962443,"Switching associations between facial identity and emotional expression: a behavioural and <e>ERP</e> study.The aim of this study was to determine if, and when, the neural processes involved in switching associations formed with angry and happy faces start to diverge. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioural responses while participants performed a reversal learning task with angry and happy faces. In the task, participants were simultaneously presented with two neutral faces and learned to associate one of the faces with an emotional expression (either angry or happy), which was displayed by the face when correctly selected. After three to seven trials, the face that had consistently been displaying an emotional expression when selected would instead remain neutral, signalling the participant to switch their response and select the other face on the subsequent trial. The neural processes involved in switching associations formed with angry and happy faces diverged 375 ms after stimulus onset. Specifically, P3a amplitude was reduced and P3b latency was delayed when participants were cued to switch associations formed with angry expressions compared to happy expressions. This difference was also evident in later behavioural responses, which showed that it was more difficult to switch associations made with angry expressions than happy expressions. These findings may reflect an adaptive mechanism that facilitates the maintenance of our memory of threatening individuals by associating them with their potential threat.",M1
19944707,"Manual response preparation disrupts spatial attention: an electrophysiological investigation of links between action and attention.Previous behavioural and neuroscience studies have shown that the systems involved in the control of attention and action are functionally and anatomically linked. We used behavioural and event-related brain potential measures to investigate whether such links are mandatory or merely optional. Cues presented at the start of each trial instructed participants to shift attention to the left or right side and to simultaneously prepare to a finger movement with their left or right hand. In different trials, cues were followed by a central Go signal, requiring execution of the prepared manual response (motor task), or by a peripheral visual stimulus, which required a target-non-target discrimination only when presented on the cued side (attention task). Lateralised <e>ERP</e> components indicative of covert attention shifts were found when attention and action were directed to the same side (same side condition), but not when attention and action were directed to opposite sides (opposite sides condition). Likewise, effects of spatial attention on the processing of peripheral visual stimuli were present only when attention and action were directed to the same side, but not in the opposite sides condition. These results demonstrate that preparing a manual response on one side severely disrupts the attentional selection of visual stimuli on the other side, and suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously direct attention and action to different locations in space. They support the hypothesis that the control of spatial attention and action are implemented by shared brain circuits, and are therefore linked in a mandatory fashion.",M1
19941298,"False discovery rate and permutation test: an evaluation in <e>ERP</e> data analysis.Current analysis of event-related potentials (ERP) data is usually based on the a priori selection of channels and time windows of interest for studying the differences between experimental conditions in the spatio-temporal domain. In this work we put forward a new strategy designed for situations when there is not a priori information about 'when' and 'where' these differences appear in the spatio-temporal domain, simultaneously testing numerous hypotheses, which increase the risk of false positives. This issue is known as the problem of multiple comparisons and has been managed with methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR), such as permutation test and FDR methods. Although the former has been previously applied, to our knowledge, the FDR methods have not been introduced in the ERP data analysis. Here we compare the performance (on simulated and real data) of permutation test and two FDR methods (Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) and local-fdr, by Efron). All these methods have been shown to be valid for dealing with the problem of multiple comparisons in the ERP analysis, avoiding the ad hoc selection of channels and/or time windows. FDR methods are a good alternative to the common and computationally more expensive permutation test. The BH method for independent tests gave the best overall performance regarding the balance between type I and type II errors. The local-fdr method is preferable for high dimensional (multichannel) problems where most of the tests conform to the empirical null hypothesis. Differences among the methods according to assumptions, null distributions and dimensionality of the problem are also discussed.",M1

19914865,"The time course of temporal discrimination: An <e>ERP</e> study.OBJECTIVE: The question of how temporal information is processed by the brain is still a matter of debate. This study aimed to elucidate the brain electrical activity associated with a visual temporal discrimination task. METHODS: For this purpose, 44 participants were required to compare pairs of sequentially presented time intervals: a fixed standard interval (1000ms), and an equal-to-standard, longer (1200ms) or shorter (800ms) comparison interval. Behavioural data and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: Long intervals were more rapidly identified than short intervals. The amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) found at frontocentral sites before the end of the comparison interval was significantly affected by the difference between its duration and the standard one. The amplitude and the scalp distribution of ERPs registered after the offset of the comparison interval were linearly modulated by its absolute duration. CONCLUSIONS: ERP components associated with the offset of the comparison intervals clarified the involvement of working memory processes and different brain structures in temporal discrimination. SIGNIFICANCE: This study further improves our understanding of the cognitive processes and neural substrates underlying temporal discrimination in healthy subjects and lays the ground for the investigation of clinical samples with time processing deficits.",M1
19914220,"Changes in familiarity and recollection across the lifespan: an <e>ERP</e> perspective.The ability to recognize previous experience depends on two neurocognitive processes, familiarity, fast-acting and relatively automatic, and recollection, slower-acting and more effortful. Familiarity appears to mature relatively early in development and is maintained with aging, whereas recollection shows protracted development and deteriorates with aging. To assess this model, ERP and behavioral data were recorded in children (9-10 years), adolescents (13-14), young (20-30) and older (65-85) adults during a recognition memory task in which the same items were studied and tested over four cycles. Participants decided whether each item was old or new and then whether the decision was associated with (Remember, R) or without (Know, K) contextual detail. Memory sensitivity was greatest in young adults, although all groups showed increases in memory sensitivity and R judgments with repetition. Familiarity-based processes (mid-frontal episodic memory, EM, effect) appeared to be used by adolescents, young and older adults, but apparently not to the same extent by children. Recollection-based processes (parietal EM effect) were recruited by children, adolescents and young adults, but to a much lesser extent by older adults. Repetition enhanced the parietal effect in all but older adults. However, post-hoc analyses indicated that reduced recollective processing was confined to poor-performing older adults. By contrast, children appeared to rely mainly on recollection concordant with their conservative decision criteria across tests. We conclude that episodic-memory development reflects the increasingly flexible and interchangeable use of familiarity and recollection with a breakdown in the latter at older ages, perhaps limited to poor-performing older adults.",M1
19901857,"Facial expression decoding as a function of emotional meaning status: <e>ERP</e> evidence.To further specify the time course of (emotional) face processing, this study compared event-related potentials elicited by faces conveying prototypical basic emotions, nonprototypical affective expressions (grimaces), and neutral faces. Results showed that prototypical and nonprototypical facial expressions could each be differentiated from neutral expressions in three different event-related potential component amplitudes (P200, early negativity, and N400), which are believed to index distinct processing stages in facial expression decoding. On the basis of the distribution of effects, our results suggest that early processing is mediated by shared neural generators for prototypical and nonprototypical facial expressions; however, later processing stages seem to engage distinct subsystems for the three facial expression types investigated according to their emotionality and meaning status.",M1
19900840,"Event-related components of the punishment and reward sensitivity.OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the properties of feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 component of the event-related potentials (<e>ERPs</e>) and their neural sources localization as neurocognitive correlates of the behavioural inhibition and behavioural activation systems (BIS/BAS). The association between BIS/BAS function and anterior cortical asymmetry was tested. METHODS: Fifty right-handed women were investigated with 30-channel recordings during an instrumental Go/No-Go learning task. ERPs were elicited to feedback signals indicating monetary losses and monetary gains. Learning performance, FRN, and P3 amplitude and latency measures were calculated and related to BIS and BAS measures by means of ANOVA and correlation analysis. The neural sources of FRN and P3 components of the ERPs were estimated using LORETA software. A resting EEG-alpha-power (8-13Hz) asymmetry measure was obtained. RESULTS: High levels of Reward Responsiveness (RR), a first order factor of the BAS, were associated with shorter RTs and enhanced positive feelings. The FRN was larger to signals indicating monetary Loss as compared to monetary Gain and enhanced with higher BIS and individual learning ability. Higher RR scores were related to greater left-sided resting frontal cortical asymmetry associated with approach orientation. High-RR subjects, as compared to Low-RR ones, had a smaller P3 amplitude for Go/Loss signals. The P3 latency to No-Go/Gain signals was the best positive predictor of RR. LORETA source localization for the FRN component displayed significantly higher brain electrical activity in left-fusiform gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus to monetary Loss in comparison to monetary Gain after incorrect No-Go responses. For the P3 wave, the monetary Loss produced significantly higher activations in the left superior parietal lobule, right postcentral gyrus, and in the ACC. CONCLUSION: The FRN was sensitive to cues of punishment and higher BIS was uniquely related to a larger FRN amplitude on No-Go/Loss trials, linking BIS with conflict monitoring and sensitivity to No-Go cues. Furthermore, the significant interaction found between BIS and RR on FRN amplitude together with the findings linking High-RR levels with shorter RTs, smaller P3 amplitudes and enhanced positive feelings are in line with the hypothesis that both BIS and BAS have the potential to influence punishment-mediated and reward-mediated behaviour. SIGNIFICANCE: Results open up new perspectives for future investigations on the relationship between BIS/BAS measures and ERP components to monetary reward during learning.",M1
19900421,"The communicative style of a speaker can affect language comprehension? <e>ERP</e> evidence from the comprehension of irony.An important issue in irony comprehension concerns when and how listeners integrate extra-linguistic and linguistic information to compute the speaker's intended meaning. To assess whether knowledge about the speaker's communicative style impacts the brain response to irony, ERPs were recorded as participants read short passages that ended either with literal or ironic statements made by one of two speakers. The experiment was carried out in two sessions in which each speaker's use of irony was manipulated. In Session 1, 70% of ironic statements were made by the ironic speaker, while the non-ironic speaker expressed 30% of them. For irony by the non-ironic speaker, an increased P600 was observed relative to literal utterances. By contrast, both ironic and literal statements made by the ironic speaker elicited similar P600 amplitudes. In Session 2, conducted 1 day later, both speakers' use of irony was balanced (i.e. 50% ironic, 50% literal). ERPs for Session 2 showed an irony-related P600 for the ironic speaker but not for the non-ironic speaker. Moreover, P200 amplitude was larger for sentences congruent with each speaker's communicative style (i.e. for irony made by the ironic speaker, and for literal statements made by the non-ironic speaker). These findings indicate that pragmatic knowledge about speakers can affect language comprehension 200 ms after the onset of a critical word, as well as neurocognitive processes underlying the later stages of comprehension (500-900 ms post-onset). Thus perceived speakers' characteristics dynamically impact the construction of appropriate interpretations of ironic utterances.",M1
19907961,"Outcome of pancreatic ascites in patients with tropical calcific pancreatitis managed using a uniform treatment protocol.Pancreatic ascites or internal pancreatic fistula is a known complication of chronic pancreatitis. This condition is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The management approach of pancreatic ascites in tropical calcific pancreatitis is infrequently reported owing to the low incidence of this condition. Between December 2005 and June 2007, 11 patients with pancreatic ascites with tropical calcific pancreatitis (male:female 7:4, mean age 29.5 [14.2] years) were treated. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent endotherapy and surgery for this condition based on an institutional protocol was performed. The end point was resolution of pancreatic ascites and relief of symptoms. All patients had pancreatic ascites, and one patient also had pancreatic pleural effusion. Endoscopic transpapillary stenting was possible in nine patients (81%). Identification of site of leak and placement of an endoscopic stent across the PD disruption was possible in five (45%) patients. All these patients had relief of ascites. Mean number of endotherapy sessions required before control of ascites was 1.8. Among the remaining four (36.6%) patients who had ERCP, placement of stent across the leak was unsuccessful; however stenting helped stabilize the general condition and nutritional status. These four patients and two patients who failed <e>ERP</e> underwent lateral pancreatojejunostomy surgery. Morbidity was observed in three patients who underwent surgery and one patient died due to sepsis and hemorrhage. All patients who had surgical drainage had complete relief of ascites and symptoms.

In the remaining patients preliminary conservative management followed by surgical pancreatic ductal drainage provides good relief of symptoms.",M2
19383077,"Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in pancreatic trauma: need to break the mental barrier.Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.",M2
18648137,"Etanercept, a TNF-alpha binding agent, is ineffective in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis in canines.CONTEXT: The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is 1-22%. It continues to be a difficult problem for endoscopist and patient. Uncovering an agent that may be used to prevent its occurrence is critical. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the role of etanercept in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. DESIGN: Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>)-induced injury was performed in dogs using a previously established endoscopic model of post-ERCP pancreatitis. ANIMALS: Eight study dogs underwent ERP: 4 were pre-treated with etanercept one day before the procedure and 4 were untreated. In addition, three control dogs not undergoing ERP were also studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of amylase, lipase, and TNF-alpha, as well as the ratio of urinary trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) and urinary creatinine, were measured before and after ERP. Necropsy was performed on post-operative day 5. All pancreatic specimens were graded by two blinded pathologists according to a validated scoring system. RESULTS: Eight study dogs developed mild to moderate clinical pancreatitis with hyperamylasemia (11,538+/-4,065 U/L vs. 701+/-157 U/L; post-ERP peak levels vs. baseline values: P&lt;0.001) and hyperlipasemia (3,637+/-2,333 U/L vs. 246+/-125 U/L; P=0.003). Mean total injury score was significantly elevated in study dogs compared to control dogs (6.16+/-1.85 vs. 1.06+/-0.49; P=0.001). There were escalating total injury scores concordant with more elaborate methods of endoscopically-induced injury although the trend did not reach the statistical significance (P=0.223). When comparing untreated to etanercept-treated dogs, there were no significant differences in serum amylase levels (P=0.903), serum lipase levels (P=0.771), TAP/creatinine urinary ratio (P=0.912), and pancreatic injury score (P=0.324). CONCLUSION: Etanercept is ineffective in prevention of mild to moderate post-ERCP pancreatitis in canines. ERP-induced pancreatic injury can be used as a reliable animal model for studies investigating therapy and prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.",M2
18507123,"Virtual CO2 MDCT pancreatography: a new feasible technique for minimally invasive pancreatectomy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Less invasive pancreatic head resection, such as duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) has been introduced for the treatment of pancreatoduodenal lesions, especially for benign conditions, for reducing surgical stress and maintaining exocrine and endocrine function of the residual pancreas in consideration of postoperative quality of life (QOL). METHODOLOGY: We investigated the feasibility of a new technique employing three-dimensional (3D) virtual pancreatography using multi-detector CT (MDCT) with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas as a negative contrast agent for detection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas requiring minimally invasive surgery. Branch IPMN is subjected in this study. RESULTS: Contrast-enhanced MDCT scan of the abdomen diagnosed 4- to 20-mm multilocular septated cysts in the head-uncinate process of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) showed multiple cystic lesions in the head-uncinate process with mild dilatation in the remaining pancreatic duct. For localizing diagnosis of these small and multiple pancreatic cysts, we placed an endoscopic pancreatic stent (EPS), and MDCT with injection of CO2 via EPS was examined for the virtual CO2 pancreatography, consisting of OsiriX software system employing 3D virtual anatomic reconstruction with CO2 gas as a negative contrast agent. Virtual CO2 MDCT pancreatography demonstrated that all cystic lesions of the pancreas were contained within the area of the head-uncinate process of the pancreas. We performed DPPHR, and surgical margin of the patient's remnant pancreas was determined as non-malignant by intraoperative histology. There was no residual pancreatic cyst and tumor after surgery. The resected tumor was diagnosed as branch duct type intraductal papillary mucinous adenocarcinoma. According to our minimally invasive DPPHR obtained by virtual CO2 pancreatography, the pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions of this patient were maintained at almost the same levels as those in his preoperative status. With respect to preservation of the endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas, DPPHR is a highly effective surgical procedure due to limited surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Our new technique of virtual CO2 MDCT pancreatography is a feasible procedure for preservation of the remnant pancreatic function. This is the first report of virtual CO2 pancreatography providing minimally invasive pancreatic surgery.",M2
17934824,"Comparison of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography for the prediction of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) is a sensitive test for the early ductal changes of chronic pancreatitis. More recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has also been proposed as a sensitive structural test for chronic pancreatitis. Few studies have compared EUS and ERP using an external reference standard. Direct pancreatic function tests (PFT) are an acceptable reference standard for chronic pancreatitis since they detect mild exocrine insufficiency. Our aim was to compare structural abnormalities as revealed by ERP and EUS for the prediction of exocrine insufficiency. Eight-three patients who underwent EUS, ERP, and secretin PFT for the evaluation of pancreatitis were identified from our database. Exocrine insufficiency was defined as a secretin PFT peak bicarbonate concentration &lt;80 mEq/l. Based on the number of abnormal sonographic criteria observed, EUS findings were categorized as normal (&lt;2 criteria), mild (3-5 criteria) or severe (6-9 criteria or calcifications). ERP findings were categorized based on the Cambridge classification. ERP and EUS did not differ significantly in either sensitivity (72% vs 68%, P = 0.52) or specificity (76% vs 79%, P = 0.40). ERP and EUS were similarly associated with exocrine insufficiency both in the presence of minimal (OR 3.4 and 4.9, respectively) and severe structural changes (OR 12 and 24, respectively). We consider EUS to have a diagnostic accuracy for the structural diagnosis of early- and late-stage chronic pancreatitis similar to that of ERP.",M2
17523324,"Lesser-sac lavage for intraoperative detection of blunt pancreatic duct injury.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Blunt pancreatic duct injury is difficult to differentiate, especially during surgery. In terms of demonstration of pancreatic duct injury, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) is the gold standard imaging study, however, availability can be problematic. Therefore, we have designed a method utilizing lesser-sac lavage to differentiate pancreatic duct injury. METHODOLOGY: Patients sustaining blunt pancreatic trauma treated at our institution over a two-year period were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Based on computed tomography (CT), these patients were divided into two groups: deep laceration or complete transection (Group 1) and superficial laceration (Group 2). Additionally, ten patients sustaining blunt abdominal trauma who had undergone emergency laparotomy for other visceral organ injury (Group 3) and four undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (Group 4) were selected as controls. For laparotomy in Groups 1-3, the lesser sac was opened for lavage, with 50 mL of 0.9% normal saline inserted, and 3mL of the sample fluid withdrawn at four time points (15, 30, 45 and 60 mins) with the fluid immediately replaced with 3 mL of saline. Lavage-ascites amylase (LAA) and lipase (LAL) levels were measured. Serum amylase and lipase activities were measured intraoperatively from 3mL of the patient's blood. RESULTS: Over the two-year study period, there were four pancreatic duct transections (Group 1), five partial pancreatic lacerations confirmed by post-ERP CT (Group 2), ten non-pancreatic traumas (Group 3), and four pancreatoduodenectomies due to pancreatic-head cancer (Group 4). The LAA and LAL for Group 1 were significantly higher than those for Group 2 or 3 at each of the four time points. The LAA and LAL ratios for Group 1 relative to Group 2 or 3 decreased gradually over time. These LAA ratios ranged from 7-13 for Group 1 to Group 2, 138-232 for Group 1 to Group 3, and 17-21 for Group 2 to Group 3. By contrast, the LAL ratio ranged from 3.0-3.4 comparing Group 1 to Group 2, 3180-29124 for Group 1 to Group 3, and 1058-8705 for Group 2 to Group 3. CONCLUSIONS: Using lesser-sac lavage for measurement of LAA and LA L constitutes a rapid, non-invasive and effective method for detection of pancreatic duct injury, especially transection of the main duct. LAA appears to be a better indicator for differentiation of minor (superficial laceration or side branch) or major (MPD) pancreatic injury at the first time point (15 minutes post lavage) compared to LAL. By contrast, LAL appears to be a better indicator with respect to differentiation of the injured pancreas from the normal organ at this time point.",M2
17520210,"A malignant nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor with a unique pattern of intraductal growth.The intraductal growth of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors (NFPTs) is considered to be rare, and in our survey of the English-language literature, we found only three cases to have been described previously. We herein report the case of a 36-year-old man with a malignant NFPT that uniquely grew within the lumen of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and completely obstructed the MPD, as shown by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Endoscopic ultrasonography clearly detected the tumor with intraductal growth. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET), using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and computed tomography (CT) with the same scanner (FDG-PET/CT) showed enhanced uptake of FDG in the tumor. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and regional lymphadenectomy were performed under the preoperative diagnosis of an NFPT. Microscopically, positive immunoreactions for synaptophisin and vasoactive intestinal peptide indicated neuroendocrine differentiation of the tumor, while in addition, metastasis to a lymph node along the common hepatic artery was also observed. The patient has survived for 6 months after the surgery without any evidence of recurrence or metastasis. Both ERP and FDG-PET/CT were thus found to be useful for predicting the malignant potential of an NFPT in the preoperative diagnosis.",M2
17337874,"[The role of multi-detector-row computed tomograph in the diagnosis of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas in comparison to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]Thirty patients with intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas underwent multidetector-row CT (MD-CT) in addition to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), and, in 27 cases magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The usefulness of MD-CT was investigated by comparing various imaging methods of the communication from the main pancreatic duct (MPD) to patulous/bulging papilla in addition to the indices for benign or malignant disease, the degree of dilation of the MPD, localization and size of cystic lesions, and presence or absence of neoplastic lesions, such as thickened walls and septa, intramural nodule, solid mass. With MD-CT, dilation of the MPD and localization and size of cystic lesions were accurately assessed, even in patients with obstruction of the main pancreatic duct in whom ERP was difficult to perform regardless of the presence or absence of massive amount of mucus. MD-CT with reconstructive imaging, such as MPR imaging and CPR imaging, allowed us to assess communication with the MPD and patulous/bulging papilla easier than MRCP. In our study, MD-CT was useful in the evaluation of thickened walls and septa that are predictive factors of malignancy in IPMT.",M2
17238037,"Possibility of diagnosing early-stage chronic pancreatitis by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography.BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that pathological lesions in chronic pancreatitis initially arise in the acini or fine ducts of the pancreas. To investigate the possibility of diagnosing early-stage chronic pancreatitis by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), we reviewed pancreatographic findings of the pancreatic duct branches in patients with chronic pancreatitis. METHODS: A total of 90 cases of chronic pancreatitis (calcified, n=52; noncalcified, n=38) were reassessed according to the imaging of the pancreatic duct branches by ERP. Degree of irregular dilatation of the pancreatic duct branches was classified into three grades: severe, moderate, and mild. We also reviewed pancreatographic findings of 57 patients with chronic pancreatitis who had undergone ERP on more than two occasions at intervals of at least 1 year. RESULTS: Severe irregular dilatation of the pancreatic duct branches was detected more frequently in cases of calcified chronic pancreatitis than in those of noncalcified chronic pancreatitis (P&lt;0.01). Histology of the pancreas showing exclusively dilatation of the pancreatic duct branches without dilatation of the main pancreatic duct showed interlobular fibrosis without marked destruction of the acini. In serial pancreatography, segmental abnormalities of the pancreatic duct at the body or tail of the pancreas spread to the head of the pancreas in eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: Irregular dilatation of the pancreatic duct branches or segmental ductal changes in the pancreatic body or tail might indicate early-stage chronic pancreatitis.",M2
17238036,"Balloon-catheter endoscopic retrograde pancreatography-compression study for diagnosis of early-stage pancreatitis.Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) is considered by many as the gold standard imaging method in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (CP). However, conventional ERP usually has a limited ability to accurately diagnose early-stage CP, in which only the branch ducts are involved and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is unaffected. To visualize precisely the branch ducts, we have developed a more sophisticated ERP method, called balloon ERP-compression study (balloon ERP-CS). In this procedure, a catheter equipped with a balloon at its tip is placed first into the MPD via the papilla with the aid of conventional ERP, followed by the removal of the endoscope, leaving the catheter behind. Then, the balloon is inflated, and the contrast medium is injected slowly. The balloon serves to block the back flow of the injected contrast medium from the MPD to the duodenum, enabling visualization of the branch ducts. The compression study affords further precise pancreatography of the corresponding area. Thus, balloon ERP-CS has now become an essential procedure for diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, including CP. So far (April 1984 to April 2005), we have performed the procedure in 1012 cases, for a total of 1562 examinations. In this study, we focus on the role of balloon ERP-CS in diagnosis of early-stage CP to elucidate its characteristic features in association with histological findings. This presentation will clarify the usefulness as well as the limitations of balloon ERP-CS for the diagnosis of CP, especially cases without the involvement of the MPD.",M2
16897285,"Long-term results of endoscopic stent in the management of blunt major pancreatic duct injury.BACKGROUND: Pancreatic stents can be used to treat a variety of acute and chronic pancreatic lesions. Sporadic successful trials in trauma patients have been reported. To our knowledge, however, a series with long-term follow-up has not previously been reported. We treated six patients in a 6-year period and report the long-term results. METHODS: From February 1999 to February 2005, six blunt-trauma patients with major pancreatic duct disruption were treated with pancreatic duct stent at a single trauma center. Assessment of injury severity and diagnosis were based on abdominal computed tomography (CT) and proved by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), with chart review used to establish mechanism of injury, timing of ERP, and stent placement, as well as the long-term outcome. RESULTS: Three of the six injuries were classified AAST grade III and three were grade IV; the interval to ERP with stent placement ranged from 8 hours to 22 days after the injury. One patient developed sepsis and died. One patient's stent could be removed early (52 days post-stenting) with mild ductal stricture, whereas the other four were complicated by severe ductal stricture that required repeated and prolonged stenting treatment. Removal of the stents was only possible in three of these four cases (at 12, 19, and 39 months, respectively), with stent dislodgment in the pancreatic duct occurring in another. CONCLUSIONS: Stent therapy may avoid surgery in the acute trauma stage, and may be preserved as another choice for acute grade IV pancreatic injury. However, variant outcome and long-term ductal stricture reveal that the role of pancreatic duct stent is uncertain and may not be suitable for acute grade III pancreatic injury. However, it needs more clinical data to define the value in the acute blunt pancreatic duct injury.",M2
16509876,"Clinicopathological features and medical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are a clinicopathological entity that is being diagnosed with increasing frequency. However, the best approach to medical management of IPMN needs to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to identify preoperative features that may be predictors of malignant IPMN, and to define the medical management of IPMN of the pancreas. METHODS: A total of 23 patients who underwent surgical resection for IPMN of the pancreas at Kochi Medical School between 1982 and 2004 were examined. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with IPM carcinoma. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients, 12 had IPMN adenoma, three had borderline IPMN, four had IPMN with carcinoma in situ, and four had IPMN with invasive carcinoma. In multivariate analysis, elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels were found to be preoperative predictors of malignant IPMN. These results suggest that the following IPMN of the pancreas should be resected: (i) IPMN of the pancreas situated in the main duct; (ii) IPMN located in the branch duct if the size of the cystic lesion is &gt;30 mm and the mural nodules are &gt;5 mm in height by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS); and (iii) the diameter of the main pancreatic duct is &gt;10 mm by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Careful observation of patients with branch-type IPMN with small cysts and/or without mural nodules is recommended as a management strategy. CONCLUSION: The present study reinforces the need for immediate surgical resection of malignant IPMN and suggests indicators for IPMN that should assist physicians in making decisions on treatment options.",M2
16427927,"ERCP findings in idiopathic pancreatitis: patients who are cystic fibrosis gene positive and negative.BACKGROUND: Our series of patients with idiopathic pancreatitis (IP) found a cystic fibrosis (CF) gene abnormality in 19% compared with 3.5% in patients without pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the CF gene predicts more severe <e>ERP</e> findings. DESIGN: This was a retrospective case-control study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: From July 1998 to August 2004, CF gene analysis was performed in 819 patients with IP via Genzyme Genetics. The panel tests for 70 to 87 alleles and has a detection rate of more than 90% of the cases. Sixty-nine patients (8.4%) who had at least one CF gene positive mutation were the study cohort. A total of 218 patients with IP and negative CF gene mutation were randomly selected from our database to be in the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Pancreatograms were evaluated for chronic pancreatitis (CP) based on Cambridge criteria. The results of the gene analysis were not available at the time of pancreatogram interpretation. RESULTS: Among patients positive for the CF gene, 42 (61%) were women. The mean age at intervention was 40 years (range 14-80 years), and 48 patients (70%) had cholecystectomy. Among patients who were negative for the CF gene, 147 (67%) were women. The mean age at intervention was 41 years (range 9-89 years), and 125 patients (57%) had cholecystectomy. Compared with controls, cases had higher incidence of CP (62% vs. 48%, p = 0.05), grade III CP (35% vs. 18%, p = 0.004), pseudocysts (12% vs. 4%, p = 0.036) and pancreatic strictures (20% vs. 8%, p = 0.008). LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the study were (1) retrospective design and (2) the panel used tests only for 70 to 87 alleles (of approximately, 900 CF transmembrane conductance regulator genes known). CONCLUSIONS: The mean age at intervention in both groups was similar. CP, grade III CP, pseudocysts, and pancreatic strictures were more common among patients who were CF gene positive.",M2
16338296,"Nonoperative treatment of traumatic pancreatic duct disruption in children with an endoscopically placed stent.The presence of ductal injury is the main determinant of consequence and a cause of significant mortality and morbidity in children with blunt pancreatic trauma. Proper treatment must be initiated on the basis of accurate anatomic diagnosis of the type and location of the injury. Computed tomography is an insufficient method for the diagnosis of the type and location of pancreatic ductal injury. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) is a reliable technique for determining the status of the pancreatic duct in children and may allow for definitive treatment of ductal injury by stenting in selected patients. There is only one study of 2 cases reporting therapeutic ERP with ductal stenting in children after blunt trauma. In this report, we present an 11-year-old child with pancreatic ductal injury who was diagnosed and treated endoscopically by stent placement, during ERP. The patient improved steadily and was discharged uneventfully. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography may be a very useful diagnostic and treatment tool in the management of main ductal disruptions.",M2
16246190,"Comparative study of diagnostic value of cytologic sampling by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration and that by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography for the management of pancreatic mass without biliary stricture.BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) can now provide a cytopathological diagnosis of underlying pancreatic malignancy with higher success rates than endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). To determine the significance of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of pancreatic mass without biliary stricture, the value of cytopathological diagnosis obtained by EUS-FNA was retrospectively compared with that by ERP, and the complications associated with these procedures evaluated. METHODS: Eighty-three patients who were suspected to have a pancreatic mass (excluding a cystic mass), without biliary stricture on conventional ultrasound and/or computed tomography were enrolled. The EUS-FNA biopsy was performed in 53 patients and cytology utilizing ERP was performed in 30 patients. RESULTS: The sampling rate of adequate specimen was 100% in both groups. In the EUS-FNA group, the overall results for the available samples were sensitivity 92.9% and accuracy 94.3%. In contrast, in the ERCP group, the overall results were sensitivity 33.3% and accuracy 46.7%. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01). With regard to complications, there was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) in the frequency of post-procedure pancreatitis between the EUS-FNA group and ERP group (0%, 0/53 vs 33.3%, 10/30, respectively). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration is safer and more accurate for the cytopathological diagnosis of suspected pancreatic masses without a biliary stricture as compared with cytology during ERP. Endoscopic ultrasonography with FNA should be considered a preferred test (prior to attempting endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) when a cytological diagnosis of a pancreatic mass is required, especially when there is no biliary obstruction, or when emergent decompression of an obstructed biliary tree is not considered clinically necessary due to lack of signs and symptoms of cholangitis.",M2
15770038,"Pancreas divisum: depiction with multi-detector row CT.PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) in the depiction of pancreas divisum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the investigational review board. Seventy-seven patients (46 men and 31 women; mean age, 51 years) underwent CT with a four-detector row scanner and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Section thickness was 3.2 mm, and the reconstruction interval was 3 mm. Two radiologists independently evaluated the CT data sets with picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstations equipped with software for two- and three-dimensional postprocessing reformations; the radiologists were blinded to the clinical and ERP data. Pancreas divisum was diagnosed at CT if what the authors termed the  dominant dorsal duct sign  (the caliber of the dorsal duct was larger than that of the ventral duct) was present and if the dorsal and ventral ducts did not appear to communicate with each other at cine review of images. ERP findings were used as the standard of reference for determining the performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of the radiologists' CT interpretations. Interobserver agreement was measured by using kappa statistics. RESULTS: For four of the 77 patients (5%), both radiologists considered that depiction of the pancreatic duct on CT images was not sufficient to enable evaluation of ductal anatomy. These patients were excluded from further analysis. In the remaining 73 patients, ERP demonstrated pancreas divisum in 10 (14%); both observers made the correct diagnosis in nine of these patients. In addition, one radiologist had one false-positive interpretation, whereas the other radiologist had two false-positive interpretations. Thus, for observer 1, the calculated sensitivity was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-98%) and the specificity was 98% (95% CI, 91%-100%). For observer 2, sensitivity was 90% (95% CI, 60%-98%) and specificity was 97% (95% CI, 89%-99%). Interobserver agreement was excellent (kappa = 0.93). CONCLUSION: CT scans obtained with multi-detector row scanners and interpreted with PACS workstations enable depiction of pancreas divisum. This assessment is possible only when the pancreatic duct is visualized.",M2
15754109,"Pancreatographic findings in idiopathic acute pancreatitis.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite extensive evaluation based on clinical history, biochemical tests, and noninvasive imaging studies, the cause of acute pancreatitis cannot be determined in 10 to 30% of patients, and a diagnosis of idiopathic acute pancreatitis is made. The purpose of this study was to clarify the pancreatographic findings in patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis. METHODS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 34 patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis, and the pancreatographic findings were examined. Patency of the accessory pancreatic duct was examined by dye-injection endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) in 16 of the 34 patients. RESULTS: In 11 patients (32%), the following anatomic abnormalities of the pancreatic or biliary system were demonstrated: complete pancreas divisum (n = 5), incomplete pancreas divisum (n = 2), high confluence of pancreaticobiliary ducts (n = 2), choledochocele (n = 1), and giant periampullary diverticulum (n = 1). Pancreatographic findings were normal in 17 patients. Eleven of these patients were examined by dye-injection ERP, and all were found to have nonpatent accessory pancreatic duct. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic abnormality of the pancreatic or biliary system is one of the major causes of idiopathic acute pancreatitis. Closure of the accessory pancreatic duct may play a role in the development of idiopathic acute pancreatitis in patients with a normal pancreaticobiliary ductal system.",M2
15549456,"Autoimmune pancreatitis with pseudocysts.A 47-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of fever, upper abdominal pain, and back pain. The serum amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IgG (especially IgG4) were elevated, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and pseudocysts. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) revealed diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct. Histopathological examination of the pancreatic tissue showed fibrotic change with lymphocytic infiltration. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this case as a case of autoimmune pancreatitis. This case also fully satisfied the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis established by the Japan Pancreas Society in 2002. Few reports have been published on cases of autoimmune pancreatitis complicated by the formation of pseudocysts in the pancreas. We, therefore, report this case here to emphasize that cases of autoimmune pancreatitis can be complicated by the development of pseudocysts.",M2
15481311,"Analysis of pancreatic elastase-1 concentrations in duodenal aspirates from healthy subjects and patients with chronic pancreatitis.Fecal pancreatic elastase 1 (PE-1) has been advocated as a noninvasive marker of pancreatic function and allows detection of moderate and severe exocrine insufficiency. Few studies have evaluated the utility of measuring PE-1 in duodenal fluid for the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency. Our purpose was (1) to determine the feasibility of measuring PE-1 concentrations in duodenal aspirates obtained through our endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) in healthy subjects and patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and (2) to determine correlations between duodenal PE-1 concentrations and bicarbonate and lipase concentrations in duodenal fluid. Healthy subjects (HS) and CP patients underwent an ePFT with CCK or secretin. CP was defined as endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) Cambridge class III-IV, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) score &gt;5, or presence of pancreatic calcifications on CT scan. Duodenal fluid PE-1, lipase, and bicarbonate concentrations were measured in each study group. Duodenal lipase and bicarbonate concentrations were measured using an autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). PE-1 was measured using an ELISA (Genova Diagnostics, Asheville, NC). Ten HS and 10 CP patients were studied. In the CCK test the median peak lipase for HS and CP was 1605 and 113 IU/L, respectively (P &lt; 0.008). In the secretin test the median peak bicarbonate for HS and CP was 102 and 40 mEq/L, respectively (p &lt; 0.008). Median PE-1 concentrations for HS and CP were 317 and 63 microg/ml, respectively, after CCK stimulation (p = 0.046) and 87 and 17 microg/ml, respectively, after secretin stimulation (p = 0.033). Statistically significant correlations were found between [PE-1] and peak [lipase] (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001), as well as [PE-1] and peak [HCO3(3)-] (r = 0.65, P = 0.037). Conclusions are as follows: (1) PE-1 concentrations can be measured from duodenal fluid obtained by endoscopic aspiration. (2) Duodenal fluid PE-1 concentrations are decreased in CP compared to HS. (3) Duodenal fluid [PE-1] has an excellent correlation with [lipase] and therefore is a marker of acinar cell function. (4) Secretin-stimulated endoscopic function testing with measurement of bicarbonate and PE-1 may provide a simultaneous assessment of both ductal cell and acinar cell function.",M2
15141882,"Evaluation of serum values of pancreatic enzymes after endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in dogs.OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) in dogs by performing repeated clinical examinations and laboratory analyses of serum amylase, lipase, canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI), and canine pancreatic elastase 1 (cE1) after the procedure. ANIMALS: 7 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: Clinical examinations were performed and blood samples obtained for serum enzyme determinations before and at intervals (10 minutes; 2, 4, and 6 hours; and 1, 2, and 3 days) after ERP. RESULTS: Repeated clinical examinations revealed no signs of ERP-induced complications in the 7 dogs. Results of repeated laboratory tests indicated a transient increase in serum values of amylase, lipase, and cTLI but not cE1. Mean +/- SD lipase activity increased from 120.7 +/- 116.4 U/L to 423.4 +/- 243.1 U/L at 4 hours after ERP. Median serum cTLI concentration increased from 16.2 microg/L (range, 77 to 26.5 microg/L) to 34.9 microg/L (range, 16.6 to 68.3 microg/L) 10 minutes after ERP. Enzyme values returned to baseline levels at the latest on day 2 in 6 of 7 dogs. Highest values for serum amylase, lipase, and cTLI and their delayed return to baseline values were detected in 1 dog with contrast filling of the pancreatic parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that ERP appears to be a safe imaging technique of pancreatic ducts in healthy dogs, although it induced a transient increase in serum values of pancreatic enzymes. In dogs, repeated clinical examinations and serum enzyme determinations can be used to monitor ERP-induced complications such as acute pancreatitis.",M2
14699691,"[The influence of the development of diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic pancreatitis on exocrine pancreatic function measured by secretin-caerulein test]Diabetes occurs in 20-30% of patients above forty years old with chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between development of diabetes mellitus in CP patients and insufficiency of pancreatic exocrine secretion as well as changes in composition of pancreatic juice. Ninety CP patients with diagnosis confirmed by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) were studied. They were divided into 3 groups in dependency on ERP changes (according to Cambridge classification) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): group A--equivocal or mild changes in ERP and normal OGTT (control group); group B--moderate or marked changes in ERP and normal OGTT: group C--moderate or marked changes in ERP and diabetes mellitus. The exocrine pancreatic function was determined by the secretin-caerulein test; volume of duodenal content and bicarbonate, protein, alpha-amylase activity outputs were measured. RESULTS: All exocrine pancreatic function parameters were diminished in B and C groups compared with A group--differences were statistically significant. However in group C values of volume and bicarbonate, protein and amylase activity were especially low. CONCLUSION: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is strongly associated with anatomical changes of the pancreas but also depends on endocrine function.",M2

12541053,"Invasive carcinoma of the pancreas derived from intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma without mucin hypersecretion but with changes in the pancreatic duct on pancreatography.We present a case of invasive carcinoma of the pancreas derived from intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma without mucin hypersecretion in a 65-year-old man with a 45-year history of alcohol abuse and a 2-year follow-up of chronic pancreatitis. Two years previously, in May 1998, he was admitted for investigation of abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse dilation of the main pancreatic duct with atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) showed a diffusely dilated main pancreatic duct with irregular side branches in the head of the pancreas. Chronic alcoholic pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of the pancreatography findings. The patient was readmitted for investigation of progressive weight loss in August 2000. Serum CA19-9 levels were markedly elevated (750 U/ml) and CT showed enlargement of the head and body of the pancreas. ERP showed irregularity of the main pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas, and the distal main pancreatic duct (which was dilated on initial ERP examination) was interrupted in the body of the pancreas. Suspected pancreatic carcinoma was diagnosed, and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Frozen section examination of the cut end of the pancreas revealed ductal carcinoma, and total pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection was performed. Histologically, the resected tumor was diagnosed as an invasive carcinoma derived from intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma without mucin hypersecretion. We recommend observing changes in the pancreatic duct on pancreatography to diagnose invasive carcinoma of the pancreas derived from intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma in a resectable state.",M2
12370540,"Clinical study of chronic pancreatitis with focal irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct and mass formation: comparison with chronic pancreatitis showing diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct.INTRODUCTION: Main pancreatic duct (MPD)-narrowed chronic pancreatitis (CP) may be an autoimmune abnormality. It also has been called autoimmune pancreatitis and sclerosing pancreatitis. It is unclear whether cases with focal pancreatographic changes are part of the same clinical entity as cases with diffuse MPD changes. AIM AND METHODOLOGY: We reviewed seven cases of chronic pancreatitis (CP) with focal narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), evidenced by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and swelling of one or two segments of the pancreas, evidenced by ultrasonography (US) /computed tomography (CT), and indicated the clinicopathologic features of focal-type MPD-narrowed CP. RESULTS: The patient group comprised six men and one woman, and their age range was 28-75 years, with a mean of 63.7 years. Affected sites were in the head in two patients, the body in one patient, the tail in one patient, and the body and tail in three patients; <e>ERP</e> showed narrowing in six patients and obstruction in one. Stricture of the lower portion of the common bile duct (CBD) that caused obstructive jaundice was shown by ERC in two cases in which the pancreas head was affected. In all six patients, a dynamic study by CT or MRI homogeneously showed delayed enhancement of involved segments of the pancreas. Serum levels of pancreatic enzyme were elevated in five patients, but only one subject had pancreatitis-like epigastric pain. Serological evidence suggestive of autoimmune abnormality was detected in only three patients with hypergammaglobulinemia (&gt; or =2.0 g/dL) or positive titers of antinuclear antibody (ANA; &gt; or =80). Histological assessment was available for five patients, who characteristically had dense lymphocytic or plasmocytic infiltration with severe fibrosis that caused luminal narrowing. The clinical, serologic, and histologic findings as described above were comparable to those for 12 CP patients with diffuse narrowing of the MPD, diagnosed during the same period. Surgical resection was performed in 5 patients, in 2 of whom a similar inflammatory process recurred in the remnant head of the pancreas, whereas pancreatitis no longer developed in the other 3 patients. One patient was initially treated with steroids, with clinical remission, although there was neither hypergammaglobulinemia nor positive ANA. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that CP with focal narrowing of the MPD is part of the same clinical spectrum as CP with diffuse narrowing of the MPD, and whether the distribution is diffuse or focal seems to be related to the stage or the extent of the disease. It is therefore important to recognize the possible existence of this focal variant to avoid unnecessary surgery.",M2
12358245,"Facilitation of pancreatic duct cannulation using a new synthetic porcine secretin.OBJECTIVES: Cannulation of the pancreatic duct at ERCP can represent a technical challenge, even to experienced pancreaticobiliary endoscopists. Secretin is a polypeptide hormone that increases the volume and bicarbonate content of pancreatic secretions. We report our single center experience in the use of a new synthetic porcine secretin (sPS) for the facilitation of cannulation of either the major or minor pancreatic orifice during ERCP. METHODS: Patients presenting for a variety of indications were enrolled. If identification or cannulation of the desired pancreatic duct was difficult, 0.2 microg/kg of sPS was administered i.v. Cannulation success or failure was recorded. RESULTS: Between March, 1999, and May, 2000, a total of 25 patients (seven men and 18 women) were enrolled. The most frequent indication (15 of 25 cases) was facilitation of dorsal pancreatic duct cannulation in patients with pancreas divisum. The overall rate of successful cannulation secretin administration was 24 of 25 cases (96%). No adverse events directly attributable to secretin were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that sPS is safe and efficacious in faciliting cannulation of either the major or minor pancreatic orifice at ERCP in the subset of patients who represent cannulation difficulties.

Computed tomography showed peripancreatic effusion and indicated an injury to the main pancreatic duct (MPD). Urgent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) was performed. The ERP revealed a leakage of contrast medium from the peripheral pancreatic duct. The patient underwent drainage of pancreatic effusion using laparoscopic techniques.

12015758,"A prospective pancreatographic study of the prevalence of pancreatic carcinoma in patients with diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: The correlation between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic carcinoma is well documented, but no criteria have been established for the efficient selection of a high-risk group among patients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients were selected prospectively from outpatients with diabetes and underwent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) according to the authors' original criteria, including the onset of diabetes after age 55 years, deterioration of diabetes or loss of body weight despite strict medical control, elevation of serum amylase and/or CA19-9 levels, and pancreatobiliary abnormalities on routine ultrasonography. The patients were divided into two groups according to the time from the onset of diabetes to ERP: Patients in Group A had recent-onset diabetes (within 3 years), and Group B patients had diabetes for &gt; 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients (excluding 1 patient with unsuccessful ERP who had undergone previous Billroth-2 gastrectomy) were enrolled. There were 33 males and 53 females, age 40-90 years, with a mean age of 65.1 years. ERP demonstrated pancreatic carcinoma, although it was advanced disease in all patients, at an extremely high rate of 7.0% (6 of 86 patients) with no serious complications. The prevalence of pancreatic carcinoma in Group A (13.9%; 5 of 36 patients) was significantly greater compared with Group B (2.0%; 1 of 50 patients; P = 0.0442). ERP with an indwelling balloon catheter and subsequent pancreatic juice sampling was performed in 49 patients, yielding positive cytology in 1 patient with pancreatic tail carcinoma, whereas measurements of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 levels in pancreatic juice were of no use in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Selective ERP in patients with diabetes who were at high risk did not lead to the early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, although this study showed that the 3-year period after the onset of diabetes was critical. A more aggressive diagnostic approach within this period in diabetic patients with the authors' criteria may contribute to the earlier diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.",M2
11871765,"Autoimmune pancreatitis starting as a localized form.Autoimmune pancreatitis is a rare type of pancreatitis that is characterized by diffuse swelling of the pancreas and irregular stenosis of the pancreatic ductal system ( sclerosing  pantreatitis), caused by autoimmune processes. Previous reports have shown the complete form of the disease, but very few have presented follow-up imagings from the beginning to the complete form. We, herein, report a case of autoimmune pancreatitis starting as a localized form. A-56-year-old Japanese man developed obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass in the head of the pancreas, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) showed localized stenosis of the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. Computed tomography (CT) showed enlargement, with a capsule-like rim, in the head of the pancreas. Internal biliary tube drainage was performed to relieve the obstructive jaundice. The patient was followed-up under the tentative diagnosis of localized  mass-forming  pancreatitis. Four months after the drainage, CT showed diffuse swelling of the pancreas, with a capsule-like rim, and ERP demonstrated diffuse irregular narrowing of the pancreatic duct. Glucose intolerance was noted for the first time. Steroid was given as a diagnostic treatment for autoimmune pancreatitis. Two months after initiation of the steroid treatment, the ERP findings were normal, and CT showed a normal pancreas. The biliary tube was removed, and the glucose intolerance was subsequently alleviated. To summarize, we report a case of autoimmune pancreatitis starting as localized  mass-forming  pancreatitis with a peripheral rim on imagings. It is very important to be well aware of the presence of the localized form of autoimmune pancreatitis.",M2
11427841,"The role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in the treatment of traumatic pancreatic duct injury.BACKGROUND: The status of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is the most important determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatic trauma. Early diagnosis and optimal treatment are critical, especially when there is MPD injury. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with pancreatic trauma were studied prospectively with respect to clinical and laboratory findings, CT, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Treatment modalities and clinical outcome were assessed in relation to ERP findings. RESULTS: The pancreatic duct was injured in 14 of 23 patients (11 MPD, 3 branch duct). Contrast leakage from the MPD into peritoneal cavity at ERP confirmed MPD injury in 8 patients, who underwent surgical exploration. Three patients with leakage from a branch duct into the pancreatic parenchyma recovered with conservative treatment. Three patients in whom ERP demonstrated contrast leakage from the MPD confined to the parenchyma underwent successful transpapillary stent insertion with complete resolution of the leak at 3-month follow-up. Patients who underwent ERP more than 72 hours after trauma had a significantly higher rate of pancreas-associated complications and a tendency to remain hospitalized longer than patients who underwent ERP earlier. CONCLUSION: Early ERP is one of the most useful methods for demonstrating MPD injury. ERP assists with treatment planning based on the degree of pancreatic duct injury.",M2
11199375,"Pancreatic ductal morphological pattern and dilatation in postoperative abdominal pain in patients with congenital choledochal cyst: an analysis of postoperative pancreatograms.BACKGROUND: Postoperative abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis has been reported as a pancreas-associated complication after total biliary excision. The aim of the present study was to determine pancreatic ductal patterns in the head of the pancreas and evaluate pancreatic ductal dilatation in patients presenting with postoperative abdominal pain after radical biliary excision for congenital choledochal cyst. METHODS: Postoperative endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) was performed in a total of 38 patients (27 female and 11 male) with a history of postoperative abdominal pain or an increase in serum and urinary amylase on laboratory analysis. Pancreatic ductal configuration and ductal dilatation were determined. RESULTS: Pancreatic configurations included the usual type (n = 20), ansa pancreatica type (n = 11), loop type (n = 5), and divisum type (n = 2). Dilatation of the pancreatic duct was observed in 34 patients. The common channel was dilated in 29 patients. Mild postoperative pancreatitis occurred in 4 patients in the long term. Protein plugs were observed in the dilated pancreatic duct. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic ductal morphological pattern and ductal dilatation, possibly caused by long-standing stagnation of the pancreatic juice, may be associated with postoperative abdominal pain and pancreatitis in congenital choledochal cyst.",M2
11126785,"Diagnosis of pancreatic injury: a need to improve performance.A direct frontal upper abdominal impact and a bicycle fall in a child are classical mechanisms of blunt pancreatic injury.

11091237,"Endoscopic stent placement for pancreaticocutaneous fistula after surgical drainage of the pancreas.BACKGROUND: Spontaneous closure of an external pancreatic fistula is unlikely when a concomitant downstream obstruction of the pancreatic duct inhibits downstream flow. Early endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) and stent insertion may enhance fistula closure in these patients. METHODS: The results of endoscopic stenting of the pancreatic duct were evaluated in 15 patients with an external pancreatic fistula that developed after operative necrosectomy and debridement of the pancreas (seven men and eight women, median age 45 (range 25-68) years). RESULTS: Median drainage before ERP was 50-800 ml/day, with an amylase content of 210,00-493,000 units/l. ERP was performed after a median time of 35 days and revealed leakage of the duct and a downstream obstruction in all patients. An endoprosthesis was inserted beyond the site of obstruction. Within a median time of 10 (range 2-64) days drainage stopped in all patients. In one patient ERP failed and pancreaticojejunostomy was performed. During follow-up (median 24 (range 2-55) months) three patients required resection of the pancreatic tail because of pseudocyst formation, all of whom originally had leakage from the tail area. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, an active approach for external pancreatic fistula seems warranted. Early ERP and stent insertion enhances fistula resolution, facilitates wound care and surgery is postponed or even avoided.",M2
11077490,"Acute pancreatitis--ERCP/endoscopic papillotomy (EPT) yes or no?Until the mid eighties ERCP and EPT were considered to be contraindicated in acute pancreatitis, because of possible aggravation of active pancreatitis or induction of new attacks of pancreatitis. This attitude was revised with the new knowledge obtained from four prospective randomised studies, which compared the effects of endoscopic treatment with conservative management of acute pancreatitis. Although the four studies are not strictly comparable their results indicate that there is no advantage to ERCP +/- EPT over conservative treatment alone in mild biliary pancreatitis. In severe biliary pancreatitis, however, ERCP with EPT reduced the number of purulent cholangitis and incidence of morbidity and in one study mortality was also significantly reduced. There is evidence, that ERCP + EPT may be important in a deteriorating acute mild pancreatitis, in the smouldering type of pancreatitis and in pancreatitis with persistent cholostasis. To avoid recurrent severe pancreatitis in patients unfit for surgery without bile duct stones but with gallbladder stones, EPT is recommended. ERCP and EPT in acute severe biliary pancreatitis during the first trimester of pregnancy have been successfully performed in four patients. Sludge and microlithiasis may be the cause of recurrent  idiopathic  pancreatitis and ERCP + EPT is effective especially in cholecystectomised patients. Furthermore in patients with recurrent pancreatitis due to malformations, such as pancreas divisum, <e>ERP</e> and minor-papillotomy produced similar results to surgical treatment. Acute pancreatitis in patients with pancreatic duct stones or ductal leaks may be treated by ERP and EPT in selected patients. Alcoholic, metabolic and infectious pancreatitis remain within the domain of conservative treatment.",M2
10798506,"Blunt pancreatic trauma: a difficult injury.The diagnosis and initial management of hemodynamically stable blunt pancreatic trauma should include a high index of suspicion when a patient has sustained a severe force vector in the anterior-posterior direction of the abdominal cavity. Patients who are hemodynamically stable should have physical examination, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, and serial determinations of serum amylase levels. If CT shows any suggestion of injury to the pancreas, such as fluid between the splenic vein and the posterior border of the pancreas, follow-up endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) should be done. In patients with a significant retroperitoneal hematoma, ERP should be followed by noncontrast CT for the evaluation of extravasation of contrast material. If ERP shows ductal disruption or follow-up CT shows extravasation of contrast, operative management is indicated.

MRP allows for the noninvasive evaluation of patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis, variant anatomy of the pancreatic duct, pancreatic duct trauma, and pancreatic neoplasia.

METHODOLOGY: ERP-CT was performed in 43 patients. The drainage area of the capitular branches of Wirsung's and Santorini's ducts were evaluated by dividing the pancreatic head into two areas, the anterior area and the posterior area. RESULTS: The pancreatic duct pattern was classified in 4 types; normal type, ansa type, loop type, and embryonic type. In normal type duct pattern, all inferior capitular branches of Wirsung's duct drained the posterior area and all inferior capitular branches of Santorini's duct drained the anterior area. In ansa type duct pattern, all inferior branches from Wirsung's duct drained the posterior area and inferior branches from Santorini's duct drained the anterior area and the posterior area. In loop type duct pattern, all inferior branches from Santorini's duct drained the posterior area and inferior branches from Wirsung's duct drained the anterior area and the posterior area. Middle capitular branches were detected only in normal B, normal C, and loop type.

The early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma using traditional radiographic or ultrasonographic methods is extremely difficult. METHODOLOGY: In order to detect an early pancreatic cancer, cytological examination, measurement of tumor marker, and detection of K-ras point mutation were performed using the samples of pure pancreatic juice aspirated endoscopically in patients who had symptoms or findings that suggested pancreatic disease. RESULTS: By routine <e>ERP</e>-cytology, positive cytologic results were obtained in 15 (4%) out of 359 patients without a mass. With the aid of intra-operative cytodiagnosis, all 15 occult neoplasms of the pancreas were successfully resected. One patient died from another disease without evidence of recurrence. However, the other patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence for an average of 5.5 years following surgery. The patients who had negative ERP-cytology results were observed, but no further cases of pancreatic cancer were found. The CEA levels in the pure pancreatic juice were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer than in those with pancreatitis. K-ras point mutation at codon 12 was detected not only in cases of pancreatic cancer, but also in cases of chronic pancreatitis as well as control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Cytological examination of pancreatic juice is useful in the diagnosis of an early and potentially curable in situ cancer of the pancreas. The CEA levels in the pure pancreatic juice provided useful information for differentiating the pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. K-ras point mutation at codon 12 in pancreatic juice was considered to be useful in identifying patients at high risk for the development of pancreatic cancer.",M2
10228758,"Minute carcinoma of the pancreas measuring 1 cm or less in diameter--collective review of Japanese case reports.BACKGROUND/AIMS: According to Tsuchiya's collective review on small pancreatic cancer measuring 2 cm or less in diameter (5), more than half of them had obstructive jaundice and the 5-year survival rate was as low as 30%. Thus, a more aggressive diagnostic approach is needed to detect a smaller and more curable cancer of the pancreas. METHODOLOGY: Thus, we collected 36 reported cases of  minute  pancreatic cancer measuring 1 cm or less in diameter, from Japanese medical literature, to analyze the relationships between the diagnostic processes and long-term results. RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with obstructive jaundice, the other 33 patients did not show any specific initial symptoms. However, 28 (78%) out of 36 patients showed an elevation in serum pancreatic enzyme levels and/or glucose intolerance. Among the 35 patients who had received ultrasonography (US) and/or computed tomography (CT), 20 (57%) patients showed duct dilation alone, whereas only 9 patients (26%) showed tumor mass. Among 35 patients who received an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), all patients showed positive findings such as obstruction/stenosis, filling defect or duct dilation. All 36 patients underwent pancreatectomy and the 5-year survival rate was 57%. However, the 5-year survival rate was 34% in the 13 patients with jaundice and/or tumor mass depicted in US/CT, while it was 69% for the 22 patients without these two findings (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data lead us to conclude that an elevation of serum pancreatic enzyme levels, glucose intolerance, and duct dilation alone depicted by US/CT should not be overlooked. ERP should be more widely applied to such patients, instead of persisting in delineating the tumor mass by US/CT or follow-up by tumor marker.",M2

In 77% of these cases, the drainage function of Santorini's duct system (including the accessory papilla) was impaired. In 13 cases with the normal duct pattern, all inferior branches from Santorini's duct drained the anterior inferior area and all inferior branches from Wirsung's duct drained the posterior inferior area. In six cases with an ansa-type duct pattern, all inferior branches from Wirsung's duct drained the posterior inferior area, and inferior branches from Santorini's duct were divided into branches draining the anterior inferior area and branches draining the posterior inferior area.

Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) revealed the characteristic grapelike cluster pattern of pancreatic ductectatic neoplasms. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was then successfully performed. Pancreatic ductectatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare entity, presenting, usually, with obstructive pancreatitis, and is histologically indistinguishable from the classic malignant mucinous cystic neoplasm.

9951852,"Diagnosis of mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas by balloon-catheter endoscopic retrograde pancreatography--compression study.The procedure of choice for the treatment of mucin-producing pancreatic tumor (MPPT) remains controversial, since it includes not only malignant but also benign lesions. The purpose of the present study was to characterize 53 consecutive cases of MPPT and to elucidate the characteristics of benign or malignant MPPT according to the findings of an improved method of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), namely balloon-catheter ERP-compression study (balloon ERP-CS), as well as endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), in comparison with a histological examination. There were 37 male and 16 female cases with a median age of 63+/-11 (mean+/-SD). The balloon ERP-CS was performed in all cases, and the obtained pancreatograms were classified into two types: Main Duct type and Branch Duct type. The latter was further divided into subtypes A and B. The Branch Duct A type showed only cystic dilatation of the branch duct. If the main pancreatic duct downstream to a cyst showed more than a 5 mm dilatation, this was classified as a Branch Duct B type. Seventeen out of 19 Main duct types (89%) were histologically diagnosed as neoplasms including 13 lesions of cancer and 4 of adenoma. All the Branch Duct A type cases were diagnosed as hyperplasias. 23 Branch Duct B type cases contained 7 cancers, 8 adenomas, and 8 hyperplasias. In the Main Duct type, benign or malignant, the diagnostic ability of balloon ERP-CS was calculated as sensitivity 100%, specificity 40%, and accuracy 84%; in the Branch Duct type, sensitivity 73%, specificity 86%, and accuracy 82%. On EUS, it was found that the size of the tumor in the cyst, with respect to the maximum diameter as well as height, correlated well with the grade of malignancy. All tumors (n=35) greater than 20 mm in diameter were found to be cancerous. These findings indicate that the MPPT is highly suggestive of neoplasms when the dilatation of the main pancreatic duct is detected by balloon ERP-CS and when, in a case without dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, a nodular lesion greater than 10 mm in diameter is identified in the cyst by balloon ERP-CS as well as EUS. Our current patient management strategy for operations is as follows: Main Duct type patients and Branch Duct type patients with a nodular defect detected by balloon ERP-CS and with an elevation of more than 10 mm in EUS should have an operation. Other Branch Duct type patients without main pancreatic duct dilatation are followed up by balloon ERP-CS.",M2
9888655,"Diagnostic value of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in chronic pancreatitis based on the new criteria proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society in 1995: comparison with the criteria proposed by the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology in 1983.This study evaluated the new criteria for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society in 1995 by comparing it with the older criteria of the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology proposed in 1983. No significant differences were noted between the two when the diagnostic sensitivity of ERP was considered in calcifying CP. Among 54 patients of noncalcifying CP (group I) with ERP diagnosis of moderate or advanced pancreatitis by the previous criteria, only one of 22 with the localized type was definite CP. The remaining 21 were ruled out as either definite or probable CP, and six were classified as having chronic obstructive pancreatitis based on the new criteria. In contrast, a diagnosis of definite CP was made not only for all the 32 patients with CP (group I) of diffuse type but also in 11 cases of CP (group II) with diffuse minimal pancreatitis showing irregular dilatation of the side branches with scattered distribution throughout the gland. In a series of 15 follow-up patients with CP (group II) having initial ERP diagnosis of minimal pancreatitis, CP group I developed in three of five cases of diffuse minimal pancreatitis, which is consistent with definite CP by the new criteria, whereas progression to this group of CP was found in none of the 10 patients with localized minimal pancreatitis. These results indicate that although localized CP is excluded from CP, the incidence of diffuse noncalcifying CP diagnosed by ERCP was increased with the new criteria, and detecting radiologic features with diffuse irregular dilatation of the branch ducts based on these criteria may lead to early diagnosis of CP.",M2
9855088,"Interleukins and their antagonists but not TNF and its receptors are released in post-<e>ERP</e> pancreatitis.OBJECTIVE: Usually it is not possible to study the initial systemic response in patients with acute pancreatitis in the first hours after onset of the disease. We used postendoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) pancreatitis as a model to study cytokine and anticytokine release in the early phase of human acute pancreatitis. METHODS: Post-ERP pancreatitis was defined as a threefold increase in serum amylase and at least two of the following clinical symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or peritonism 24 h after ERP. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), as well as endogenous antagonistic mediators of the systemic inflammatory response such as soluble tumour necrosis factor alpha receptors p55 (TNFR p55) and p75 (TNFR p75), and IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1-RA) and interleukin-2-receptor (IL-2R) as indicators of lymphocyte activation were measured before and 0, 1, 4, 12, 24 and 48 h after ERP. In nine patients with acute post-ERP pancreatitis, these parameters were monitored daily until C-reactive protein (CRP) was within normal ranges and were compared to patients without pancreatitis after ERP. RESULTS: IL-1beta was not detectable in five patients with and four patients without post-ERP pancreatitis. The values of the remaining patients in both groups were lower than 3.9 pg/ml. IL-8 and IL-1-RA serum concentrations peaked 12 h after ERP (132.9 and 3245.0 pg/ml respectively) compared to patients without post-ERP pancreatitis (25.8 and 389.9 pg/ml respectively). The IL-6 concentration increased to 81.6 pg/ml (8.0 pg/ml in control patients) 24 h after ERP, while the peak values for CRP were measured 72 h after ERP (164.0 versus 7.7 mg/l). IL-2R content was maximally elevated 144 h after ERP (688.8 versus 255.9 U/ml), while concentrations of TNF and its receptors showed no significant change over time. CONCLUSION: The initial response of the cytokine network to damage of the human pancreas leading to acute pancreatitis includes the release of IL-8 and the IL-1 antagonist IL-1-RA, while IL-1beta is not found in the systemic circulation. The TNF system does not seem to be involved as indicated by the lack of detectable changes in TNF and the soluble TNFR p55 and p75 serum concentrations. Lymphocyte activation as indicated by elevated IL-2R levels occurred days after the initial trauma. Even mild post-ERP pancreatitis leads to significant systemic release of cytokines and their biological counterparts.",M2
9849061,"[Endoscopic therapy of pancreas divisum]Pancreas divisum is the most frequent congenital ductal anomaly of the pancreas: it occurs in 5-10% of the population. In the majority of patients, this congenital anomaly is of no clinical importance. In a certain subset of patients, however, pancreas divisum is clinically important as a cause of abdominal pain, acute recurrent pancreatitis or chronic obstructive pancreatitis. The authors, experience on endoscopic drainage of the minor papilla is reported. In the history of patient 1., three episodes of recurrent pancreatitis and permanent upper abdominal pain were explored. <e>ERP</e> revealed a pancreas divisum and a mild irregularity and dilation of the dorsal pancreatic duct. A 7 F stent (length: 6 cm) was implanted in the dorsal pancreatic duct following a papillotomy on the stenotic minor papilla. A repeated Lundh test revealed a 58% improvement in the exocrine pancreatic function. No recurrence of pancreatitis has been observed in spite of the moderate continuous abdominal pain. In patient 2., ERP demonstrated a pancreas divisum and a severely dilated dorsal pancreatic duct as causes of the previous permanent abdominal pain. An 8 F stent (length: 5 cm) was inserted through the minor papilla without endoscopic sphincterotomy. A significant improvement in exocrine pancreatic function (70%) ensued. No abdominal pain has since been observed. In conclusion, dorsal pancreatic duct stenting (mainly in cases involving a dilated pancreatic duct) seems to have a beneficial effect in patients with both recurrent acute pancreatitis or chronic obstructive pancreatitis evoked by pancreas divisum.",M2

9820386,"Patency of the accessory pancreatic duct in relation to its course and shape: a dye-injection endoscopic retrograde pancreatography study.OBJECTIVE: The accessory pancreatic duct (APD) exhibits several appearances on pancreatography. We examined the patency of the APD by dye-injection endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), and studied the relationship between patency and duct course and shape. METHODS: There were 213 patients with satisfactory imaging of the entire normal APD who also underwent dye-injection ERP. The length and maximum diameter of the APD and the length of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) from its orifice to the junction with the APD were measured. RESULTS: The caliber of the patent APD was 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm. This was significantly larger than the caliber (1.1 +/- 0.4 mm) of the nonpatent APD (p &lt; 0.01). The length of the MPD from its orifice to the junction with the patent APD was 32.7 +/- 12.5 mm. This was significantly longer than the length to the junction with the nonpatent APD (22.5 +/- 8.1 mm) (p &lt; 0.01). The APD was classified according to duct course: long type, intermediate type, short type, or ansa type. Patency was most common in the long type APD (74.5%). The terminal shape of the APD was also used to classify the ducts: stick type, branch type, saccular type, cudgel type, or spindle type. Patency was most frequently observed in the spindle and cudgel type ducts. CONCLUSIONS: Patency of the APD might be dependent on duct caliber, course, and terminal shape of the duct.",M2

Blood glucose and serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide and glucagon were measured before and after stimulation. Exocrine pancreatic function was assessed by the pancreolauryl serum test (PLT), and morphological changes were staged by endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography (<e>ERP</e>), which were rated as I (mild), II (moderate) or III (severe). RESULTS: Glucagon and C-peptide secretions after arginine stimulation were reduced in patients with moderate and severe chronic pancreatitis while no parameter was able to show impaired endocrine function in the early stage (ERP I) of the disease. Serum insulin concentrations proved to be of no use in the diagnosis of pathological B-cell function, since even patients with severe chronic pancreatitis and fasting normoglycemia demonstrated normal insulin secretion.

9361095,"Evaluating exocrine function tests for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.To evaluate the effectiveness of exocrine function tests in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis (CP), we compared the sensitivity and specificity of duodenal intubation with tubeless tests. While the secretin test (ST) was necessary to diagnose CP, especially in noncalcified CP, and tubeless tests demonstrated insufficient sensitivity to diagnose CP, the combination assay of tubeless tests was specific enough to diagnose severe exocrine dysfunction. Our studies found the sensitivity of secretin testing to diagnose definite CP to be 87%. In patients with probable CP, 60% had mild exocrine insufficiency and 40% had normal function. The false-positive rate of the ST results in nonpancreatic diseases, except diabetes mellitus, was 5%. The correlation between morphological changes in endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) and exocrine function evaluated by ST was 74%. In patients with calcified CP, 81% had parallel results between ERP and the ST, but in noncalcified CP, 47% had parallel results. In patients with severe or moderate exocrine insufficiency demonstrated by ST, abnormally low levels were observed in 63% by N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (BT-PABA) test, 61% by fecal chymotrypsin test (FCT), and 44% by pancreatic amylase (PA). In patients with normal exocrine function demonstrated by ST, abnormally low levels were observed in 28% by BT-PABA test, 28% by FCT, and 10% by PA.

This observation caused the authors to develop a new method of p53 immunocytochemistry using cytologic samples obtained by endoscopic retrograde pancreatic duct brushing (ERPDB). METHODS: Fifteen cases of MPT (9 with carcinoma and 6 with adenoma) were examined. In all cases, histologic diagnosis was determined by surgery or autopsy. A wire with a small brush was pushed into the dilatated pancreatic duct detected by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Specimens obtained by brushing were prepared on slides and subsequently fixed with ethanol. Papanicolaou staining and p53 immunocytochemistry were performed simultaneously. The ability of conventional cytology to distinguish adenoma from carcinoma was compared with that of p53 immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Five of 9 cases (56%) with carcinoma of MPT were correctly diagnosed by Papanicolaou staining. Two of four cases, classified as benign by Papanicolaou staining, expressed p53 protein. Overall, 7 of 9 cases (78%) with carcinoma MPT were correctly diagnosed by Papanicolaou staining associated with p53 immunocytochemistry. In the cases with adenoma MPT, all cases were classified as benign by Papanicolaou staining and no case positive for p53 protein was encountered. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p53 immunocytochemistry as an adjunct in cytologic diagnosis using ERPDB may contribute to differentiating adenoma from carcinoma MPT of the pancreas preoperatively.",M2

The aim was to determine whether endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERP)-induced pancreatitis can be used as a human model for the study of cytokine release and acute phase response in the first hours of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients undergoing ERP for different reasons were prospectively evaluated by sampling blood before and 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours after ERP and, in patients who developed an acute post-ERP pancreatitis, daily until C reactive protein (CRP) was within normal range. A post-ERP pancreatitis was defined as a three-fold increase of amylase or lipase and at least two of the clinical symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and peritonism during 24 hours after ERP. RESULTS: Nine out of 70 patients developed an acute pancreatitis. Cytokines and other biochemical variables were measured in those nine and in 34 patients out of the 61 not developing pancreatitis. In the nine patients amylase and lipase increased within the first hour after ERP with maximum values between four and 12 hours. Interleukin-6 increased to maximal concentrations after 24-48 hours and the highest CRP concentrations were found 72 hours after ERP. Tumour necrosis factor did not change.

9018014,"Patency of the human accessory pancreatic duct as determined by dye-injection endoscopic retrograde pancreatography.The accessory pancreatic duct (APD) is the smaller and less constant pancreatic duct. The patency of the APD was investigated clinically in an effort to determine its role in pancreatic pathophysiology. Dye-injection endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) was performed in 190 cases. In the patients who exhibited filling of the fine branches of the ducts on ERP, contrast medium with indigo carmine was injected into the major duodenal papilla. The patency of the APD was determined by observing the excretion of the dye from the minor duodenal papilla. Of the 123 control cases studied, 41% had a patent APD. According to the shape of the terminal portion of the APD on accessory pancreatogram, it was classified as either the stick type (n = 63), branch type (n = 15), saccular type (n = 15), spindle type (n = 11), or cudgel type (n = 8). In these groups, 49, 0, 27, 82, and 87% of the APD were patent, respectively. The patency of the APD in the patients with acute pancreatitis was 6% (1 of 17). The difference in patency between this group and the control group was significant (p &lt; 0.01). The patency of the APD varies with the shape of the terminal portion of the APD.

8921706,"[Characteristic findings of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with inflammatory mass]Chronic pancreatitis with inflammatory mass (CPM) is difficult to differentiate from pancreatic cancer. To clarify the characteristic findings of CPM, we performed endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) in 39 patients. The pancreatogram showed smooth stenosis at the site of the mass in 26/39 cases (66.6%), irregular stenosis in 6 (15.4%), obstruction in 4 (10.3%), and no stenosis in 3 (7.7%). In the case of stenosis on ERP, the length of the stenosis correlated with the size of the mass. The pancreatogram distal to the mass showed dilatation in 26/35 cases (74.3%), 18 (51.4%) of which were simple dilatation. A follow-up study of 5 cases showed that all the stenoses had remained, and that the pancreatitis was aggravated in 2 cases.

Tapering stenosis of pancreatic duct in 2 patients out of 2 with pancreatic cancer, shape of cyst and relationship between cyst and pancreatic duct in 7 patients out of 7 with pancreatic cysts, and irregularity of wall of pancreatic duct in 2 patients out of 3 with chronic pancreatitis was reconstructed by 3D-CTP, stereographically. Moreover, the confluence of cyst and pancreatic duct in 3 out of 7 pancreatic cysts did not become clear on balloon-ERP, but it was distinct on 3D-CTP. It is suggested that 3D-CTP is useful in understanding pancreatic diseases stereographically, and can be applied to operative simulation, interventional radiology and differential diagnosis on them.",M2
8872776,"Case report: mucin-producing cystic neoplasm of the pancreas with onset in childhood.Mucin-producing tumours of the pancreas have been recently reported with increasing frequency and most cases have occurred in middle-aged and elderly people. In the present report, a case of a 21-year-old man with mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas is reported. He had a long history of recurrent pancreatitis from the age of 8. When he was aged 10, the first branch of the main pancreatic duct was shown to be enlarged on endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography (<e>ERP</e>). A series of ERP studies and computed tomography scans performed over a period of 11 years demonstrated continuing growth of this enlargement of the pancreatic duct.

8829191,"The relationship between drinking status and serial changes of pancreatographic findings in patients with suspected early chronic alcoholic pancreatitis.Twenty-two patients (mean age, 48.5 years) suspected of early chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, who had ductal changes mainly in the side branches, were followed by serial endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). Follow-up ranged from 1.1 to 11.9 years (mean, 5.4). Serial ERP revealed deterioration in six patients (27%), five of whom had outflow disturbance of the main pancreatic duct. On the other hand, five patients presented slight progressive changes restricted to the side branches and the remaining 11 patients showed no change. None of the 12 patients who abstained from drinking showed a deterioration of their pancreatogram. The deterioration of clinical symptoms was less frequently seen in patients with abstinence (5/12) than in those who continued drinking (10/10). This study suggests that a ductal abnormality mainly in the side branches may be an early sign of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Outflow disturbance of the main pancreatic duct might play an important role in the progression of the pancreatogram to an advanced stage. Abstinence is associated with a high probability of stabilization of both clinical symptoms and ductal changes.",M2

To delineate pancreatic ductal injuries more accurately, we performed repeat computed tomography (CT) shortly after completion of ERP. We describe our experiences with six patients to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this method. In our cases, the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal injury was made with certainty on the basis of the presence of extravasated contrast medium. This protocol is useful for reaffirmation of injuries noted on ERP, for diagnosis of injuries not noted on ERP, and for exclusion of injuries in patients with equivocal results of ERP. Moreover, the protocol is easy to implement because it involves only the transfer of the patient from the endoscopy to the CT suite.

7572904,"Fecal elastase test: evaluation of a new noninvasive pancreatic function test.OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic elastase is highly stable along the intestinal tract. A new ELISA is commercially available to measure human specific elastase-1 concentration in stool. We evaluated the behavior of this fecal elastase test (FET) compared with other indirect pancreatic function tests in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). METHODS: A total of 69 patients were included in the study, 20 of whom were diagnosed with CP according to the findings on <e>ERP</e> and CT; 13 patients had other pancreatic diseases, and the remaining 36 patients had gastrointestinal or hepatic disorders. All patients' elastase-1 concentrations and chymotrypsin activities [fecal chymotrypsin test (FCT)] were measured, and the serum pancreolauryl test (PLT) was performed. RESULTS: Similar to PLT, fecal elastase concentration was significantly decreased in patients with moderate and severe CP (assessed by ERP) compared with patients with extrapancreatic disorders. However, and contrarily to PLT, FET was not affected by gastric resection, malabsorption due to intestinal disease, or marked alteration of the gastric motility. The sensitivity of FET was 100% for moderate to severe CP but 0% for mild CP; the specificity was 83%. Compared with other indirect pancreatic function tests, FET appears to be as sensitive as PLT and as specific as FCT, and it is clearly more specific than PLT and more sensitive than FCT. Unlike FCT, FET was not affected by oral enzyme supplementation. CONCLUSION: FET is a simple and accurate functional test for CP, and it is hardly influenced by extrapancreatic disorders or therapy with exogenous enzymes.",M2
8625176,"Effectiveness of the cytologic examination of pure pancreatic juice in the diagnosis of early neoplasia of the pancreas.BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma through the use of traditional radiographic or ultrasonographic methods is extremely difficult. METHODS: To detect an early and potentially curable cancer of the pancreas, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) and aspiration cytology of pure pancreatic juice were performed in 295 consecutive patients who had symptoms or findings that suggested pancreatic disease but in whom there was neither a pancreatic mass nor ductal stenosis. RESULTS: Positive cytologic results were obtained in 12 patients (4%). With the aid of intraoperative cytodiagnosis, all 12 early neoplasms of the pancreas were successfully resected. Of these 12 resected specimens, 4 were adenocarcinoma with minimal invasion, 3 were in situ adenocarcinoma and 5 were marked atypia. All 12 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence for an average of 32 months after surgery. The 283 patients who had negative ERP-cytology results were observed, but no further cases of pancreatic cancer were found. CONCLUSIONS: Because ERP-cytology is simple to perform, safe, and reliable, it is useful in the diagnosis of patients who have early neoplasm of the pancreas.",M2

We performed ERPs in 36 patients who had positive findings in physical examinations, serum amylase levels and CT within about 13 hours after injury to diagnose the DIs early after injury and to avoid negative laparotomy. In 33 successful ERP patients (intraoperatively in 3), 22 had PIs (14 DIs) and 11 had non-PIs. Of 14 patients with DIs, 12 with main DIs and one with branch injury were treated surgically. Another patient with branch injury, who was treated conservatively, died of the complications of PI. Nineteen patients without DIs, including 8 PIs, were treated conservatively or operated for the associated abdominal injuries, who had no complications on PIs in the hospital days. Three unsuccessful ERP patients, having PIs, were also operated upon. Among 15 patients, including these 3 patients and 12 treated surgically during the era before introducing ERPs, 2 (13.3%) negative laparotomies were noted. Among 16 patients, who underwent both of ERP and operation, no negative laparotomies were noted. No complications of ERPs occurred. In conclusion, ERP is a reliable modality to detect DIs and to determine the therapeutic modalities for PIs.",M2

7728351,"Retrograde pancreatography. Technical tips and spectrum of pathology.<e>ERP</e> is an important technique in the diagnosis of diseases involving the pancreatic ducts, in determining therapeutic strategy, and in assessing the results of surgical bypass procedures. ERP facilitates the diagnosis of the majority of pancreatic tumors at a stage when they normally present to the clinician. It assists the diagnosis of small tumors in the ampullary region at an early stage when other tests are negative. In cases of obscure recurrent pancreatitis, ERP may identify a mechanical cause (e.g., stone, stricture). ERP is useful in the diagnosis of CCP only in the precalcified stage. If histologic confirmation already has been obtained at surgery, ERCP is not required. Compared with noninvasive techniques, ERP provides additional information: It enables a concomitant examination of the gastroduodenal tract and opacification of the bile ducts; additional procedures may be performed, such as intraductal cytologic brushings, biochemical and cytologic analysis of pancreatic juice, endoscopic manometry, and pancreatoscopy. The diagnostic yield is increased if these procedures are performed during ERCP. Because ERP outlines the ductal anatomy, it is of great value in assessing therapeutic strategy. In cases of acute recurrent pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis, ERP provides an important baseline for performing procedures such as ductal drainage and therefore reduces the inappropriate use of exploratory laparotomy. In cases of necrotic pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma, ERP enables accurate localization of a pancreatic fistula and facilitates any subsequent surgical procedure. Finally, ERP is the method of choice when assessing the patency of pancreatic-digestive anastomosis.",M2
7728340,"What does an abnormal pancreatogram mean?The foregoing discussion emphasized the fact that pancreatography can document changes that are relatively specific for chronic pancreatitis but that similar changes can be seen in other clinical conditions and even as normal variants. In addition, the exact clinical implication of minor or equivocal changes is unclear and care should be taken not to overinterpret <e>ERP</e> findings. It also must be realized that ERP may miss a substantial number of patients with earlier or less advanced chronic pancreatitis. ERP also may document pancreas divisum, but is not helpful in explaining the patient's clinical condition in the absence of dorsal duct abnormalities. Finally, tests of pancreatic function--in particular, hormonal stimulation tests--are complementary to tests of pancreatic morphology and allow the diagnosis of less advanced or earlier chronic pancreatitis, as well as patients with divisum and normal dorsal ducts who nonetheless have obstruction to flow at the minor papilla. The evaluation of a patient with presumed chronic pancreatitis therefore should begin with simple, noninvasive tests that are able to detect advanced forms of chronic pancreatitis. These include plain abdominal radiograph and serum trypsin. If either of these is markedly abnormal, no further diagnostic testing is generally required. In patients in whom diagnostic uncertainty still exists, reasonable second-echelon tests include abdominal CT, bentiromide testing, or secretin stimulation testing. Of these, hormonal stimulation testing offers the most sensitivity but is not universally available. More invasive evaluations--in particular, ERP--should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is still unclear or in whom therapeutic rather than diagnostic information is required (e.g., a patient classified a medical failure being considered for Peustow procedure).",M2

We studied 12 patients with CP undergoing surgery and five controls with cancer of the pancreatic tail. CP was staged on the basis of morphological (<e>ERP</e>) and functional (serum-pancreolauryl test) criteria. Patients kept daily records of the intensity of pain on a linear analog scale. Intraoperatively, pressure within the pancreas was assessed by the introduction of a fine needle into the pancreatic parenchyma connected to a pressure transducer. In controls, pressure was determined in macroscopically normal tissue in the head of the pancreas. Pancreatic pressure was significantly higher in CP than in controls (29.9 +/- 3.1 vs 7.2 +/- 1.1 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001). No relationship was found between the pain score and the pancreatic pressure. Pressure was positively correlated with ductal changes (r = 0.831; p &lt; 0.001), but not with exocrine function of the pancreas. Postoperatively, pancreatic pressure fell by 15.3% in four patients with CP in whom pressure assessment was repeated after surgical decompression.

The usefulness of in vivo IDUS was evaluated by comparison of images with the ERP findings. IDUS was of diagnostic value in 18 of the 40 patients; it distinguished between 4 malignant and 6 benign causes of localized stenosis revealed by ERP, provided parenchymal information in 2 cases with only displacement revealed by ERP (1 islet cell tumor and 1 teratoma), and determined the extent of tumor in 6 cases with main-duct-type mucin-producing tumor. Ten of 11 cancer, 4 of 12 mucin-producing tumor, 1 islet cell tumor, and 11 of 15 chronic pancreatitis (previously scanned in vivo), and 2 islet cell tumor (not scanned in vivo), were resected and scanned in vitro. Fifteen normal pancreases from autopsy subjects were also scanned in vitro.

In functioning tumors, tumor size was 2 cm or less in 6 benign cases, but 5 cm or more in 2 malignant cases. In nonfunctioning tumors, tumor size was larger, ranging from 3.5 to 8.0 cm. Diagnostic accuracy for localization of functioning tumors was 66.7% for US, 75.0% for CT, 66.7% for endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), and 50.0% for selective angiography, while all nonfunctioning tumors could be detected by any diagnostic imagings. Percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling for immunoreactive insulin was very helpful to localize insulinoma. Stenosis or obstruction of the main pancreatic duct on ERP and arterial encasement on angiography highly suggested a malignant tumor.

Twenty patients (14 men, mean age 54 years) who were examined for other reasons and who had a normal ERP served as controls. EUS was performed in most cases with the knowledge of ERP results which had been classified according to the Cambridge classification system of chronic pancreatitis as being grade 0 (normal) or 1-3 (inflammatory changes). Parenchymal and ductal changes on EUS were correlated with the ERP changes. Abnormal EUS features were found in all patients with grade 2 and 3 chronic pancreatitis, in 88% with stage 1, and in 63% of cases with a normal ERP as well. These changes were, however, not detectable in any of the 20 control cases. Among the EUS features of chronic pancreatitis, diffuse changes predominated (stage 1: 75%, 2: 88%, 3: 96%) and consisted mainly of alternating echopoor and echorich areas and of a lobulated parenchymal pattern. In 80% of patients, these findings were combined with an irregular pancreatic margin. Changes of the main pancreatic duct were found in stages 2 and 3 in 81% and 96%, respectively; isolated side branch alterations, as detected mainly in stage 1 chronic pancreatitis on ERP, escaped endosonographic visualization.

The subjects of this study included eight patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>), nine patients with acute pancreatitis, and six healthy controls. The serum IP-PLA2 levels were elevated after ERP and during acute pancreatitis. The amount of active pancreatic PLA2 in the serum was determined after its separation from pancreatic prophospholipase A2 using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The serum IP-PLA2 was separated into two peaks on reverse-phase HPLC. The one which eluted faster contained the PLA2 activity; the other peak did not. The latter IP-PLA2 peak consisted of pancreatic prophospholipase A2 as judged by HPLC analysis and PLA2 activity determination of the products after treatment with trypsin. The proportion of active pancreatic PLA2 in the serum IP-PLA2 of patients after ERP (13.9 +/- 0.5%) increased slightly compared with that in fasting, healthy controls (8.0 +/- 1.1%). For those with acute pancreatitis, the proportion of active pancreatic PLA2 within 48 hours of hospital admission increased more markedly (44.0 +/- 5.7%) than that after ERP. These findings demonstrate that the proportion of active pancreatic PLA2 in the serum IP-PLA2 markedly increases during the early stage of acute pancreatitis, and that an ERP-induced rise in the intraductal pressure leads to the leakage of pancreatic PLA2 into the circulation, but not to a marked activation of the leaked enzyme.",M2

The efficacy of properly timed prophylaxis with a therapeutically effective antibiotic had previously been established by a pilot study and a definitive trial based on HPLC assays of endoscopic biopsy specimens taken from the duodenal papilla. In Group A (n = 182) there was hyperamylasaemia without a leucocytic reaction in only 18 (14.75%) of the <e>ERP</e> patients and two (3.33%) of the ERC patients, but in Group B (no antibiotic - n = 220) this change was detected in 48 (35.29%) of the ERP patients and 12 (14.28%) of the ERC patients (P = 0.00018 and 0.043 respectively). Hyperamylasaemia with a leucocytic reaction occurred in only one patient with ERP from Group A (0.82%) as compared with 15 patients (11.02%) from the untreated group (P = 0.00047). These results were highly significant. There were three cases of subclinical pancreatitis and two of acute pancreatitis--all of them in the control group. Although these results were not statistically significant (because the number of cases was too small), they are clearly consistent with the growing tendency towards using antibiotic cover. On the basis of these results we regard antibiotic prophylaxis during ERCP as a sensible precaution, and in patients with any concurrent disease which heightens the risk it is essential.",M2
1539580,"Pancreatic pleural effusion: case report and review of 113 cases in Japan.A patient with pancreatic pleural effusion in whom a fistulous tract was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) is presented, and reports on 113 cases of this entity in the Japanese literature are reviewed. The most common (99%) underlying cause of this entity was chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. In most cases, the patients complained of chest symptoms (68%), and complained of abdominal symptoms less frequently (24%). It is important to maintain suspicion for this entity in patients with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis who have unexplained pleural effusion. Surgical intervention was required in 58 of 95 recorded cases. With care, the prognosis of pancreatic pleural effusion was good. Recently, as endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) and CT have been performed more frequently, the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of pancreatic pleural effusion has been determined. We stress that ERP and CT should be performed to direct surgical therapy and learn more about the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic pleural effusions.",M2
1734484,"US-guided percutaneous pancreatography: an essential tool for imaging pancreatitis.The pancreatic duct can be opacified when contrast material is injected through a fine needle percutaneously placed under ultrasound (US) guidance. Percutaneous pancreatography was performed in 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis diagnosed at US or computed tomography (CT). In 52 of these patients, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) was unsuccessful or did not enable complete visualization of the duct. The percutaneous pancreatograms and other relevant images of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Percutaneous pancreatography was successful in 54 patients (86%), in whom it clearly mapped the full ductal anatomy, depicted the relationship between cavities seen at US or CT and the duct, and allowed assessment of duct drainage after antegrade injection of contrast material. This information was not provided by other modalities. Percutaneous pancreatography is a valuable complement to CT, US, and ERP for imaging chronic pancreatitis.",M2
1928034,"A comparative study of contrast agents for endoscopic retrograde pancreatography.Pancreatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality secondary to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>). One factor that may cause post-ERP pancreatitis is the type of contrast media utilized during the procedure. The purpose of this prospective, double-blind, randomized study was to evaluate the effects of three contrast agents of differing osmolality and ionicity on changes between pre- and post-ERP chemical changes in serum amylase and lipase and development of clinical symptoms of acute pancreatitis. Our study of 53 patients showed that those who received Omnipaque a non-ionic, relatively iso-osmolar contrast agent, had a significantly lower serum amylase (p = 0.0038) and serum lipase (p = 0.0002) in post-ERP serological markers, compared with patients who received the ionic agents, Hypaque meglumine 60% or Hexabrix. In addition, the development of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis was less in patients who received Omnipaque than in those who received Hexabrix or Hypaque (1 vs. 3 vs. 4). No significant difference was found between patients who received ionic agents. No patient who received Omnipaque needed hospitalization, whereas one (6%) patient who received Hexabrix was hospitalized compared to three (20%) hospitalized patients who received Hypaque. When the initial cost and cost of hospitalization were compared, the non-ionic contrast medium was also found to be more cost-effective for the patient. In summary, the risk of post-ERP acute pancreatitis was significantly lower for patients who received the non-ionic contrast agent than for those who received the ionic agents.",M2
1758084,"[Study of patency of minor duodenal papilla--comparison between pigment method combined with pH sensor and pancreatographic method]We investigated the patency of minor duodenal papilla in 25 cases that had presented normal pancreatogram by using the endoscopic retrograde pancreatographic (<e>ERP</e>) method and a pH sensor-combined indigo carmine pigment method. The pigment method allowed us to classify the function of minor papilla into three types according to pancreatic juice excretion pre- and post-secretin administration (Type I), excretion after secretin administration (Type II), and no excretion even after secretin administration (Type III). Twelve cases belonged to Type I, 4 cases to Type II and 9 cases to Type III. By ERP method, terminal shapes of the Santorini's duct were classified as stick type, cystic type and branch type. 19 cases were considered stick type, 2 cases cystic type and 4 cases branch type. Eighteen cases were identified as patent minor papilla under ERP method. There were two cases alleged to be patent under the ERP but without pancreatic juice excretion. Therefore, the necessity of pigment method was confirmed for investigation of the function of minor papilla.",M2
1852040,"[Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) in acute alcoholic and biliary pancreatitis]An analysis of the ERP findings in 31 patients with acute pancreatitis enable us to define the terminology of the pancreatogram in these diseases. Irregularities of the ducts indicate previous damage to the organ. A frequent phenomenon is thinning of lateral branches, which can be explained by compression due to oedema. Early parenchymal staining indicates abnormal permeability of the duct epithelium. Cavities are an expression of acute pseudo-cysts. A sign characteristic of alcoholic pancreatitis is the presence of contrast defects due to protein plugs and due to increased viscosity of pancreatic secretions. These observations confirm the theory that protein precipitates due to abnormal secretions play an important role in acute pancreatitis.",M2
2077160,"[The diameter of main pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and the appearance of main pancreatic duct on computed tomography: a comparative study]We have carried out a comparative study of the diameter of main pancreatic duct (MPD) on endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) with the frequency of detection of MPD by computed tomography (CT) in order to clarify the importance of MPD appearance on CT in the pancreatic and biliary diseases. The normal MPD on ERP was demonstrated by CT in a low frequency. MPD was most frequently observed in the pancreatic body on CT. The dilatation of MPD on ERP was found in both moderate and advanced pancreatitis group. However, the significant demonstration of MPD by CT was found in advanced group alone. We observed that CT finding of dilated duct correlated with that on ERP in advanced group alone.",M2
2240868,"The role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) in blunt abdominal trauma.The diagnosis of pancreatic injury is often difficult because it lies retroperitoneally in a protected area. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of blunt pancreatic trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography (ERP) is infrequently used in the diagnosis of pancreatic injury. We reviewed our experience with the use of ERP in patients with blunt pancreatic injury. Two stable patients with traumatic pancreatitis underwent ERP shortly after injury. CT scans revealed a transverse fracture of the distal pancrease in one and fluid accumulation in the other around the pancreas extending to the right kidney and left hepatic lobe. The absence of ductal disruption on ERP allowed nonoperative management of the pancreatitis. Resolution was documented by the absence of symptoms on regular oral intake, normal serum amylase levels, and normal follow-up CT scans. A third patient with persistent fistulae three months postinjury underwent preoperative ERP revealing ductal obstruction. This facilitated the planning of a distal pancreatectomy and subsequently the fistulae healed. A fourth patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy on the basis of clinical and CT scan findings that could have been circumvented with preoperative ERP. ERP in selected patients allows nonoperative treatment in the absence of ductal injury or earlier operative treatment of ductal injury. It also aids the treatment of late complications by delineating ductal anatomy.",M2
1699712,"Dynamic CT scanning of pancreatic duct after secretin provocation in pancreas divisum.Variations in pancreatic duct diameter at CT scanning and serum pancreatic amylase response following secretin administration were studied in 29 patients with pancreas divisum and unexplained upper abdominal pain. Eleven healthy individuals were used as controls. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) six patients had signs of marked and six moderate pancreatitis, whereas there were no pancreatitis changes in 17 of the patients. At CT scanning patients with marked pancreatitis (ERP) had significantly increased pancreatic duct diameter as compared to patients without signs of pancreatitis. The duct was visualized in 52% of all patients before and 71% after secretin stimulation the corresponding figures for healthy controls, being 18% both before and after secretin. In patients without signs of pancreatitis, it was demonstrated in 5/17 (29%) before and 11/17 (65%) after secretin, whereas it was seen in 10/12 (83%) pancreatitis patients both before and after the hormonal provocation. In five of the nonpancreatitis patients in whom the duct was measurable before and at all study intervals (10, 20, and 50 min) after secretin, there was a significant duct dilation response both at 10 min and when comparing the maximal duct diameter after secretin to the initial values. In contrast secretin did not affect the duct caliber in pancreatitis patients. Serum pancreatic amylase increased significantly after secretin administration to healthy controls and nonpancreatitis patients but was uninfluenced in the marked and moderate pancreatitis groups, respectively. However, when all pancreatitis patients were grouped together, the amylase levels were significantly elevated by secretin. In conclusion, secretin provocation caused duct dilation at CT scanning in pancreas divisum patients without signs of pancreatitis at ERP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
2396092,"Comparison of regional pancreatic tissue fluid pressure and endoscopic retrograde pancreatographic morphology in chronic pancreatitis.The relation between pancreatic tissue fluid pressure measured by the needle method and pancreatic duct morphology was studied in 16 patients with chronic pancreatitis. After preoperative endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) the patients were submitted to a drainage operation. The predrainage pressures were higher in the tail of the pancreas (29 mm Hg; range, 16-37 mm Hg) than in the head (18 mm Hg; range, 2-30 mm Hg; p = 0.02). The regional pressure differences were significantly greater in four patients who had previously undergone pancreatic surgery than in the 12 patients without previous surgery. A stone, total obstruction, or major stenosis in the pancreatic duct at ERP was related to a downstream pressure gradient significantly higher than found in a non-obstructed pancreatic main duct, but the relation was not uniform. Generally, there was no significant relation between pancreatic duct diameter and pressure, but in each individual patient, the regional pressure tended to be highest in the region with the largest duct diameter. In conclusion, the study shows considerable regional pressure differences in chronic pancreatitis and indicates that the intraoperative pressure measurements give important information supplementary to ERP about the pathologic process in patients with chronic pancreatitis.",M2
1950216,"[Pancreatogenic pleuritis and pancreatico-pleural fistula: pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy]Two patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis are presented, who developed a massive pleural effusion characterized by an extremely high amylase content. We report our diagnostic observations and therapeutic experiences in non-operative and surgical management. A review on the pertinent literature is given. Acute pancreatitis frequently (10-20%) occurs in conjunction with small left-sided pleural effusions. These effusions usually undergo spontaneous regression. Their genesis is explained by vascular transdiaphragmatic inflammatory involvement of the pleural space. In patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis pleural effusion is, however, a rare event. The activity of the pancreas-specific enzymes (amylase, lipase) are extremely high. The most likely underlying pathogenetic mechanism is transdiaphragmatic lymphatic transfer of pancreatic secretions to the subpleural space. A rare cause is the formation of a pancreatico-pleural fistula. The use of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>) can reveal the site of pancreatic fistulas to the pleural cavity.",M2
1843972,"Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in elderly patients.We studied two hundred patients aged 65-88 years who underwent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (<e>ERP</e>); the control group included 200 patients aged 35-55 years. A normal pancreatogram was found in 51.6% of the geriatric patients and in 59.0% of the middle-aged patients. Pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis with  Moderate  changes (according to the Cambridge classification) were significantly more frequent in the group of elderly patients. In the geriatric patients without pancreatic changes in the ERP, the main pancreatic duct (in the head, body and tail of the pancreas) was significantly wider than that in the corresponding group of middle-aged patients. We suppose that age-dependent changes in the pancreas must be taken into consideration during diagnostic procedure in elderly patients.",M2
