19146041,"Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome with migraine-like headaches treated with minocycline: a case report and review of the literature.Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG), which presents clinically as persistent lip swelling, is characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation of unknown origin. CG may also be part of the classic triad of the Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) and alone is considered by some to be an oligosymptomatic form of MRS. We report a case of CG associated with migraine-like headaches in a 44-year-old woman. The clinical presentation, histologic findings, and subsequent treatment are described. A brief review of the literature also is provided.",M1
19027510,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome revisited as a misdiagnosed disease.PURPOSE: We aimed to attract our college's attention to the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>), which has been an infrequently encountered subject in otolaryngology journals during the last 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the last 10 years' patient database was performed to find patients with MRS. The medical files, treatment charts, and radiological and histopathological records of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 3 MRS patients who had been misdiagnosed for 9, 10, and 16 years. Two of them have had the symptoms since adolescence. All of them presented orofacial edema and fissured tongue, whereas first two also had recurrent facial paralysis. Characteristic histopathological features were noted in 1 patient. Electromyography (EMG) was done in 1 patient who underwent facial decompressiom. All patients responded to either systemic or intralesional corticosteroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the daily practice of an otolaryngologist, it is not usual to diagnose a patient as having MRS. We consider that this is partly because of misdiagnosis. We therefore believe that this study will supply an additional aspect to otolaryngologists, in the scope of recurrent facial paralysis and orofacial edema in both children and adults.",M1
18927530,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome patient: casual association or related diseases?Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. MRS is classically defined as a triad of recurrent orofacial edema, relapsing paralysis of the facial nerve, and fissured tongue. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old woman with orofacial swelling and facial pain attacks. The patient reported to suffer of hypothyroidism and laboratory findings disclosed free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyrotropin (TSH) altered. Endocrinological consult led to the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Antithyroper-oxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) were highly elevated and thyroid function tests had evidenced a clinically significant hypothyroidism. A link between MRS and immunological disorders such as sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, unilateral anterior uveitis and multiple sclerosis was documented. The literature did not report any association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The presence of the anti-TPO antibodies in the case reported here could suggest a possible correlation between immunological alteration characteristic of autoimmune thyroiditis and MRS.",M1
18685938,"Anesthetic management of patients with Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome.Melkersson Rosenthal Syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a rare disorder characterized by relapsing facial paralysis, persistent or recurrent orofacial edema, and lingua plicata. It may cause difficult airway, drug allergy, and angioedema. In our anesthetic management of two patients with MRS, preanesthetic immunological blood examination and skin tests for hypersensitivity to anesthetic drugs were applied. Because the principal goal is to avoid all factors that may stimulate, an allergic reaction, anesthetic drugs known to trigger urticaria were avoided. Body and operating room temperatures, changes of which may trigger allergic reactions, were kept constant during the perioperative period. Emergency precautions were taken for probable angioedema. MRS is a rare syndrome, and if its manifestations are misunderstood as simple facial paralysis, it may be overlooked by anesthesiologists. Anesthesiologists must be careful of several problems in patients with MRS.",M1
18477847,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.BACKGROUND: Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a rare disease whose full-blown form is characterized by orofacial swelling, facial palsy and lingua plicata. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the complement system as well as its role in patients with MRS. METHODS: Seven patients presenting at this hospital between November 2002 and May 2003 and meeting the diagnostic criteria according to Hornstein were evaluated retrospectively. The investigations included clinical signs, an analysis of the complement system including levels of CH50, C3, C4, C1 inhibitor (INH) functions and C1-INH antigen detection. RESULTS: Two female patients showed isolated low levels of functional C1-INH as determined by duplicate tests. Both patients took estrogen-progestin contraceptives. CONCLUSION: Since deficiency in plasma protease C1-INH is known to lead to recurrent angioedema, we hypothesize that low levels of functional C1-INH may have contributed to the orofacial swelling in the 2 patients.",M1
18241724,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.OBJECTIVES: To study characteristics of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) patients with facial palsy (FP) and differences in patients treated at the Departments of Otorhinolaryngology and Dermatology. METHODS: Clinical picture of MRS was studied from patient charts at two departments. Patients with FP received a questionnaire and were examined. Tissue biopsies were searched for non-necrotizing granulomatous infiltrations typical of MRS and blood DNA for UNC-93B1 gene mutations predisposing to herpesvirus infection. RESULTS: At the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, all 18 MRS patients had FP, 9 the triad form. Two patients revealed non-necrotizing granulomatous infiltrations during acute edema episodes; another two had association with uveitis. Edema was rarely persistent and did not dominate the clinical picture. No UNC-93B1 mutations were found. At the Department of Dermatology, 2 patients had triad MRS and 15 had monosymptomatic granulomatous cheilitis with persistent edema and typical MRS histology. CONCLUSION: The clinical picture of MRS with FP differed from the current knowledge of edema-dominated MRS. More studies focusing on MRS with FP would broaden our understanding of the syndrome.",M1

17577330,"Expression of protease-activated receptor-1 and -2 in orofacial granulomatosis.OBJECTIVE: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare condition characterized by non-caseating granulomas in the orofacial region. Protease-Activated Receptors (PARs) play a role in inflammatory diseases in diverse human tissues. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of PAR-1, PAR-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-1, and COX-2 in tissues taken from OFG patients. METHODS: PAR-1, PAR-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-1, and COX-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in biopsies taken from oral Crohn's disease (five cases), Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) (six cases), cheilitis granulomatosa (five cases) and normal oral mucosa (five cases). RESULTS: PAR-1 was observed in mononuclear inflammatory cells in edematous/lichenoid lesions, whereas a strong PAR-2 immunostaining was detected in epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells in granulomatous lesions, irrespective of the clinical features (Crohn vs MRS). MMPs and COX-2 were expressed in the inflammatory component of edematous/lichenoid lesions and markedly overexpressed in granulomatous lesions. COX-1 was weakly and variably expressed in both edematous/lichenoid and granulomatous lesions. CONCLUSION: Thus, PAR-1 and PAR-2 expressions were related to the intensity and type of inflammatory response but not to the type of clinical lesion. Simultaneous overexpression of PARs, MMPs and COXs suggests synergism among these proinflammatory receptors and enzymes.",M1
17505613,"Cheilitis granulomatosa associated with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) consists of persistent or recurrent orofacial edema, relapsing facial palsy and fissured tongue. The complete triad of symptoms is uncommon, varying from 8 to 25%. The presentation of only one symptom is more common. The most frequent complaint is facial edema and enlargement of the lips. We describe a case of a 17-year-old Brazilian girl with limited edema of the lower lip and fissured tongue due to MRS. Her complaints had started two years before. She referred previous clinical treatments without success. We proposed intralesional injection of triamcinolone at 20 mg every 15 days associated with oral clofazimine at 50 mg/day for three months. The lip became normal after four triamcinolone injections. Recent studies have considered MRS a granulomatous disease, and possibly the initial presentation of Crohn's disease in orofacial area of some patients. MRS patients, therefore, should be screened and monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroid treatment seems to be effective in reducing lip enlargement. We discuss the clinical features of this disease, the treatment, and the importance of corticosteroid therapy in cases of MRS-related facial palsy.",M1

We report here a case of MRS with the classical triad of signs accompanied by unilateral anterior uveitis. A 35-year-old man with a fissured tongue, recurrent facial palsy and orofacial oedema presented with a 3-month history of conjunctival redness and decreased vision in the right eye. On evaluation of visual acuity, the patient was only able to count fingers. Slit lamp examination revealed severe conjunctival injection, cells and flare, posterior synechiae and keratic precipitates. Examination of the left eye revealed no evidence of inflammation. Examination of the other systems was normal. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics and the visual acuity improved to 7/10.

16856704,"A monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome in an 8-year old boy.Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a systemic neuro-mucocutaneous granulomatous disease, characterized in its classical form by a triad of recurrent facial nerve paralysis, swelling of the lips and lingua plicata. However, this classical triad is rarely present, while the monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic forms are more frequent. The presence of two or one of the manifestations mentioned above, with granulomatous cheilitis in the biopsy, is sufficient to make the diagnosis of monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic form of MRS. This syndrome is very rare in childhood, instead, it is more frequent in young adults between the second and third decades of life. We present the case of an 8 years old boy who was brought to us because of a non painful swelling of the upper lip, associated with gingival hypertrophy, that had persisted for more than two months. Given the negative results of the hemato-chemical and instrumental assessments, we performed an upper lip biopsy whose histological study showed granulomatous cheilitis. We diagnosed this case as a monosymptomatic MRS and administered an intralesional steroid therapy using triamcinolone, with complete recovery.",M1
16508356,"Plastic surgical solutions for melkersson-rosenthal syndrome: facial liposuction and cheiloplasty procedures.OBJECTIVE:: Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a rare granulomatous disease characterized by a triad, including orofacial swelling, facial palsy and lingua plicata with usually recurrent or progressive course. Orofacial swelling, the most often sign of MRS, leads to the both esthetic and functional deformities. Because of its unknown etiology, a rational treatment is difficult and management of MRS still remains symptomatic, aiming at to remove orofacial swelling mainly. Although the many nonsurgical therapies have been mentioned in the literature, none has been proved uniformly and predictably successful to date. In this paper, we present different surgical procedures and their outcomes in a series of 4 cases with MRS. The procedures including mucosa, submucosa and tangential muscle resection, crescent shaped commissuroplasty, and facial liposuction may be considered in surgical armamentarium when orofacial swelling becomes persistent. We think that the plastic surgeons may act more effectively in the management of the syndrome in the future.",M1

A fissured tongue and telangiectatic rosacea had been present since the age of 50 and 60 years, respectively. The patient was also affected by essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A skin biopsy showed a marked upper dermal oedema, and small epithelioid cell granulomas arranged in perivascular and perilymphatic location. Collections of small epithelioid cells were occasionally observed within lymphatic spaces. No acid-fast bacteria, fungi or foreign bodies were detected. Intralesional corticosteroids induced transient improvement, whereas minocycline, clofazimine and dapsone have been ineffective. MRS may present with unilateral eyelid and periorbital swelling.

15370404,"Treatment and follow-up of persistent granulomatous cheilitis with intralesional steroid and metronidazole.Granulomatous cheilitis (GC) is a chronic edema which frequently affects the upper lip due to granulomatous inflammation. Its etiology is currently unknown. This rare disease is generally accompanied by Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>), characterized by scrotal tongue, orofacial edema and facial paralysis. However, it is also known to develop only with orofacial edema. Granulomatous cheilitis is a difficult disease to treat because of recurrences. There are contradictory reports about the results of treatment without surgical intervention and the rates of recurrence. Our case was a 57-year-old female patient who was characterized by orofacial edema only. The edema and erythema had persisted for 1 year before admission. In the present case, application of intralesional corticosteroid treatment as a total of three injections over 3 consecutive months (one injection per month) and the accompanying metronidazole treatment brought about successful results. No recurrence was observed in the follow-up.",M1
15346363,"Orofacial granulomatosis presenting as persistent lip swelling: review of 6 new cases.PURPOSE: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is an uncommon disease, which presents usually as a persistent swelling of the soft tissues in the orofacial region and is characterized histologically by a granulomatous inflammation. The term orofacial granulomatosis is used in the literature to describe a nonspecific granulomatous inflammation. A subset, cheilitis granulomatosa (CG), which presents clinically as persistent lip swelling, is a granulomatous inflammation of unknown origin of the lips. CG may also be part of the triad of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) and some consider it as an oligosymptomatic form of MRS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, we reviewed the clinical records of all patients between the years 1990 and 2002 with the histologic diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation of the lip from the Department of Pathology at the Montreal General Hospital. The age at biopsy, sex, site of lesion, other signs of MRS, signs and symptoms of systemic granulomatous disease, and the treatment were compiled. RESULTS: Six subjects were included in the study, 5 females and 1 male. Four had swelling of the lower lip and 2 of the upper lip. In one patient a history of facial nerve palsy was reported and in another one a mild fissured tongue was present. No signs or symptoms of systemic granulomatous disease were noted. The treatment consisted of intralesional steroids with good results in 5 out of 6 patients. CONCLUSION: A thorough work-up to eliminate other etiologies of granulomatous disease is essential when a patient presents with granulomatous inflammation of the lip. CG seems to respond well to steroid treatment and the need for surgery is minimal and should be reserved for recalcitrant cases.",M1

Granulomatous cheilitis (GC) is regarded as a monosymptomatic form of MRS. The exact aetiologies of MRS and GC are unknown. In this study we investigated the possible role of mycobacteria in these two conditions. A ribosomal RNA amplification-based Gen-Probe amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test was used to investigate the presence of M. tuberculosis complex in paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens from five patients with MRS and one patient with GC. Three of the six specimens were shown to be positive using this system; one of the positive specimens also showed positive Ziehl-Neelsen staining.

These include Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>), Miescher's cheilitis (an oligosymptomatic form of MRS), Crohn's disease, and sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A great deal of attention has been devoted to the similarity and overlap in clinicopathologic and histomorphologic features of these conditions, suggesting that they may actually represent a spectrum within a single overarching entity. In the review of the 13 cases of OFG retrieved from the files of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Department of Dental Medicine, we describe their presentation, clinicopathologic features, and management. These cases comprise examples of MRS (in its oligosymptomatic forms) and Crohn's disease. The similarity, kinship, and overlap between the cases presented are clearly demonstrated.

METHODS: Routine HE sections and Warthin-Starry special staining were carried out in 20 cases of CG and 6 cases of MRS. Meanwhile there were 9 cases of CG and 2 caes of MRS were treated by penicillin (12 000 000u, i.v., per day) for two courses (14 days). RESULTS: A kind of spirochete was discovered in the sections of all cases of the CG and MRS. The CG and MRS could be divided into two types histopathologically, that is granuloma type and interstitial inflammatory type (non-granuloma type), those morphological changes tallied with spirochetosis. After treatment by penicillin, the facial and labial swelling of the 11 cases of CG and MRS were abated. CONCLUSION: CG and MRS probably are infectious diseases caused by spirochetes.",M1

METHODS: We studied 20 cases of MRS, with 10 cases of granuloma type and the other 10 cases of non-granuloma type. The negative results of periodic acid-schiff (PAS), Neelren anti-acid special staining and tuberculosis (TB)-DNA polymerase chain reaction proved that all cases were not TB and fungous disease. Then all the cases were labelled with antibody of lysozyme by immunohistochemical staining and investigated with electron microscope. We studied the expression of lysozyme in multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells and histiocytes. RESULTS: The results of lysozyme staining were positive in the multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells and histiocytes of the granuloma type and were negative in those cells of the non-granuloma type. On the other hand, the small multinucleated giant cells which had 2-3 nuclei were the features of the morphological structure of the granuloma type. The small multinucleated giant cells were not seen in the non-granuloma type. CONCLUSION: In this paper, two pathological types (granuloma and non-granuloma type) in the MRS were proved further and it is found that the different structures of granuloma can be used to discriminate between MRS and sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.",M1

11144840,"Total decompression of facial nerve for Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a rare condition characterized by recurrent facial paralysis in addition to various orofacial manifestations. The condition appears to be a granulomatous disorder causing oedema and inflammation of the soft tissues of the face, lips, oral cavity and particularly, the facial nerve. There is general agreement that the symptoms and signs resolve spontaneously, aided perhaps by an empirical course of oral steroids. However, in some patients the condition may be progressive, leading to disfiguring facial synkinesis and increasing residual paralysis. There is anecdotal evidence in the literature to suggest that surgical decompression of the facial nerve in its entire intratemporal course may prevent further attacks of facial paralysis and its sequelae. We present here our experience with surgical decompression of the facial nerve in a 27-year-old woman with MRS who had sufferent recurrent left-sided facial palsy since the age of four.

Borrelia burgdorferi is a spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis, a multisystemic infectious disease with frequent occurrence of facial nerve paralysis. An etiologic role of B burgdorferi in various granulomatous diseases has been suggested. The present study was performed to examine a possible causative role of B burgdorferi for GC/MRS by B burgdorferi-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy specimens from affected lip tissue and determination of B burgdorferi IgG and IgM serum antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot tests. OBSERVATIONS: We examined a retrospective case series of 12 patients with GC/MRS from a Lyme borreliosis endemic area (median duration of disease, 8 months [range, 3-348 months]). Borrelia burgdorferi-specific DNA could not be amplified by polymerase chain reaction in any of the 12 patients. One (13%) of 8 patients tested had a serum B burgdorferi IgG response on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 2 patients (25%) had an IgM response, but immunoblot testing yielded negative results in all 8 patients.

10676788,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome: new clinicopathologic findings in 4 cases.OBJECTIVE: To define the clinicopathologic features of eyelid involvement in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>). METHODS: Four patients with eyelid edema consistent with MRS were evaluated clinically, including diagnostic imaging in 2 patients. Eyelid tissue from these patients was examined by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus was performed in 1 case. RESULTS: The 3 men and 1 woman ranged in age from 33 to 74 years. All patients had insidious, painless, nonpitting eyelid edema. Three patients had unilateral edema; one had bilateral, asymmetric involvement. Ipsilateral lip edema was present in 1 case. Computed tomography demonstrated periorbital heterogeneous thickening that corresponded to the microscopic finding of scattered granulomas. All 4 patients demonstrated epithelioid granulomas inside and adjacent to dilated lymphatic vessels. Polymerase chain reaction testing was negative for herpes simplex virus. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated eyelid swelling that mimics thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy may occur in MRS. Computed tomography may be useful in the diagnosis. Biopsy should be performed in all cases of unexplained nonpitting eyelid edema. In the eyelid, MRS is characterized histopathologically by a granulomatous lymphangitis, a finding that seems to be unique to this condition.",M1
9934409,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome in a diabetic boy.The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) consists of recurrent edema of the lips, intermittent facial palsy and furrowed tongue. This is the classic triad which defines the syndrome, although it is accepted that the presence of two manifestations or one with a granulomatous cheilitis in the biopsy, are sufficient to make the diagnosis. The case of a 15 year-old diabetic boy is presented. He had a persistent edema of the upper lip of one-year duration, which started abruptly without any clear etiologic correlation. He was treated with antihistaminics and corticosteroids without improvement but with diabetic imbalance. The complementary examinations were normal and the biopsy was compatible with granulomatous cheilitis. Despite the low incidence and the fact that there is no specific treatment, MRS has to be considered as a diagnostic possibility in a patient with recurrent edema although not necessarily having the complete triad.",M1

9522567,"[Glossitis granulomatosa--an unusual subtype of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome]So-called  glossitis granulomatosa , described in 1952 by H. Schuermann as a peculiar manifestation of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>), is little known in oral medicine due to the paucity of cases published so far. During the past 25 years the author has observed eight definite cases of glossitis granulomatosa and confirmed its close connections with MRS. The recurrent inflammation tends to change into persisting macroglossia with considerable functional and sensory oral disturbances. The clinical diagnosis, histologically supported by biopsy, can definitely be established, yet the outcome of the mostly chronic macroglossitis (with danger of later tongue carcinoma) may be very doubtful. Knowledge of Schuermann's glossitis, a member of the group of etiologically unclarified lingual inflammations, is important for physicians involved in oral medicine because of its therapeutic and prognostic implications.",M1
9467364,"Granulomatous cheilitis: a study of six cases.OBJECTIVE: Granulomatous cheilitis (GC) is a very rare disorder of unknown etiology. Clinically, GC is characterised by recurrent swelling of the labial tissues, which may be followed by a permanent enlargement. Histologically, the typical form of GC is characterised by the formation of scattered aggregates of non-caseating granulomas. GC is the most frequent sign of orofacial granulomatosis, a disorder under which also encompasses sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, atypical tuberculosis, Anderson-Fabry disease, possibly some allergic reactions, and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>). Some consider GC as an oligosymptomatic or monosymptomatic form of MRS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study we examined the clinical records of six patients presenting with GC which were examined and treated in the Department of Oral Medicine and Pathology of the Dental School of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece) during a 16-year period. In five of six patients a persistent swelling of the lower lip was recorded, one of whom also developed swelling in the upper lip. In one case the swelling was present in both lips and in another the GC was the only clinical finding, while in the other five cases it was accompanied by at least one other feature of MRS. In five cases, the histological picture revealed non-caseating granulomas. RESULTS: The treatment with the intralesional infusion of corticosteroids in three cases and the oral administration of corticosteroids in two cases was successful. One of the patients refused to be treated. This patient also presented later with permanent swelling of the upper lip.",M1
9198316,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome--a challenge for dermatologists to participate in the field of oral medicine.Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) is a neuro-muco-cutaneous disorder involving remittently both the oro-facial innervation and muco-cutaneous tissues in a pathosis of complex origin characterized by recurrent edema, facial or other palsies, and nerval dysfunctions frequently associated with plicated tongue. Biopsies taken from the edematous tissues often reveal a temporary pattern of moderate epitheloid granulomatous inflammation scattered scarcely within remarkable tissue edema. However, this histological pattern is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of MRS. The disease usually runs an intermittent and unpredictable course over years or decades and may have, if the edemas involve the tongue or the central nervous system, an ambiguous outcome. Greatly disfiguring oro-facial swellings often result from secondary persistence of the primarily recurrent edemas. A classification on grounds of different 'major' and 'minor signs' of MRS is proposed in the present paper. In recent years, novel therapeutic approaches involving either oral clofazimine or laser beam acupuncture (according to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine) have proven to be successful in some cases of MRS. Dermatology could play a larger role in oral medicine by taking diseases such as MRS into account in studies among specialties dealing with oro-facial pathoses.",M1

The result was that infiltration of lymphocytes in granulomatous type was more severe than that in interstitial inflammtion type. Infiltrators mainly consisted of T helper lymphocytes and immunoglobulin was IgM. It was considered that local immunoreaction was enhanced suggesting that cyto-immunity was a dominant factor with participation of humoral immunity.

The lack of efficacy of various classical molecules (corticoseroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, colchicine, clofazimine) led to a surgical therapy, consisting in cheiloplasty. Systemic corticosteroids were associated. The result was good, with a follow-up of 2 years.

Lack of response to food additive challenge.A study was made of six patients with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (<e>MRS</e>) to establish the aetiological role of foodstuffs and/or additives and the possible associated immunological alterations. In all cases Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) was diagnosed both clinically and histologically, excluding other causes of orofacial granulomatosis (OFG). A detailed study of possible triggering factors was performed in all patients. Blood analysis, x-rays and cultures, were always within normal limits, with the exception of the finding of circulating immune complexes (CICs) in three patients with facial palsy associated, and C-reactive protein positivity in two patients who presented persistent labial oedema. All patients were subjected to skin-prick tests with common inhalant allergens and with foods when sensitization to foods were suspected, and patch tests with European Standard Series and pastry components, organic dyes, perfumes and fragrances series. The results were negative in all cases. When asymptomatic, the patients were subjected to a double-blind oral challenge, under placebo control, with additives (monosodium glutamate, tartrazine, sulfites, erythrosine, paraoxybenzoate, sodium benzoate, lactose, aspirin, and annate), which was again negative. In no case did the patients refer the appearance of outbreaks with exposure to foods or contactants, and the course of the disease was unaffected by exclusion diets and the elimination of contactants. To conclude, we observed no sensitization to foods, additives or contactants in our patients. Likewise, there were no antecedents of atopy or hereditary predisposition related to the aetiopathogeny of MRS. The significance of the CIC encountered only in patients with facial paralysis remains to be established, due to the limited number of patients studied.",M1

METHODS: Twenty-three premenopausal women underwent breath-hold point-resolved single-voxel 1H-MRS of the liver followed by respiratory-gated 1H-MRS at 3 Tesla and CT slice through the liver. Interscan variability for 1H-MRS was assessed in 6 volunteers. Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman 95% limit of agreement, and concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between breath-hold and respiratory-gated 1H-MRS (r = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001; concordance correlation coefficient, 0.75). Using Bland-Altman analysis, all but 2 data points were within the limits of agreement. Both 1H-MRS techniques had low interscan variability.

Subjects performed plantar flexion at fixed 35% load maximum voluntary contraction. Heart rate variability was performed during 10 min supine rest using digital photophlethysmography as a measure of autonomic function. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, the CFS/ME group had significant suppression of proton efflux both immediately postexercise (CFS: 1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol L(-1) min(-1) vs. normal: 3.6 +/- 1.5 mmol L(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.001) and maximally (CFS: 2.7 +/- 3.4 mmol L(-1) min(-1) vs. control: 3.8 +/- 1.6 mmol L(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.05).

The ratio of the three main metabolites ([choline + creatine]/citrate) were measured along with spectral analysis of different regions of interest (ROI) placed in areas of normal tissue and cancer using the surgical specimen as the standard of reference. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three voxels were analyzed. Qualitative visual analysis identified pathological spectra in 88.5% of cancer ROI, 11.7% of normal transitional zone ROI and 1.6% of normal peripheral zone ROI. The ratios of normal prostate tissue were significantly more elevated (p&lt;0.0001) in the transition zone (0.41 +/- 0.24) than in the peripheral zone (0.22 +/- 0.36). Tumor containing voxels had significantly higher ratios (2.84 +/- 2.74) than normal tissue containing voxels of the transition zone (p&lt;0.0001) and peripheral zone (p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSION: Prostate MRS using external surface coils appears routinely feasible at 1.5T, even though it presents some limitations.",M2
20373390,"Myocardial fat quantification in humans: Evaluation by two-point water-fat imaging and localized proton spectroscopy.Proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) has been used for in vivo quantification of intracellular triglycerides within the sarcolemma. The purpose of this study was to assess whether breath-hold dual-echo in- and out-of-phase MRI at 3.0 T can quantify the fat content of the myocardium. Biases, including T(1), T*(2), and noise, that confound the calculation of the fat fraction were carefully corrected. Thirty-four of 46 participants had both MRI and MRS data. The fat fractions from MRI showed a strong correlation with fat fractions from MRS (r = 0.78; P &lt; 0.05). The mean myocardial fat fraction for all 34 subjects was 0.7 +/- 0.5% (range: 0.11-3%) assessed with MRS and 1.04 +/- 0.4% (range: 0.32-2.44%) assessed with in- and out-of-phase MRI (P &lt; 0.05). Scanning times were less than 15 sec for Dixon imaging, plus an additional minute for the acquisition used for T*(2) calculation, and 15-20 min for MRS. The average postprocessing time for MRS was 3 min and 5 min for MRI including T*(2) measurement. We conclude that the dual echo method provides a rapid means to detect and quantifying myocardial fat content in vivo. Correction/adjustment for field inhomogeneity using three or more echoes seems crucial for the dual echo approach.",M2
20307015,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in photosensitive idiopathic generalized epilepsy.Studies investigating the pathophysiology of epileptic photosensitivity indicate variable involvement of particular brain regions. Our aim was to identify metabolic differences between photosensitive idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) patients and nonphotosensitive IGE patients and normal healthy subjects by using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>). Fourteen patients diagnosed with photosensitive IGE were investigated. The control groups consisted of 14 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers and 14 IGE patients without photosensitivity. MRS measurements of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr) were performed in the frontal and occipital cortex and the thalamus bilaterally using a stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) technique with a voxel size of 20 x 20 x 20 mm. The values of the patients with IGE were compared with those of the normal controls and within subgroups according to the clinical variables by appropriate statistical tests. Photosensitive IGE patients showed significantly decreased concentrations of NAA in the right frontal lobe and left thalamus, decreased NAA/Cr ratio in left thalamus and significantly increased concentrations of Cho/Cr ratio in the right frontal lobe and NAA/Cr in the left occipital lobe when compared to normal controls. Furthermore, left occipital NAA concentration increased and left thalamus NAA/Cr ratios were decreased from the IGE patients without photosensitivity but without reaching statistical significance. Our results support previous MR studies suggesting an asymmetrical neuronal dysfunction in favor of the dominant occipital cortex and thalamus in photosensitive IGE patients.",M2
20299741,"Function of the frontal lobe in autistic individuals: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic study.PURPOSE: In this investigation, we studied differences in chemical metabolites in certain brain regions between autistic patients and normal control subjects. METHODS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) was used to evaluate functional activity in these regions. Specific regions studied were right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC) and the anterior cingulated cortex(ACC). RESULTS: In the ACC, the N-acetylaspartate(NAA)/creatine/phosphocreatine(Cr) ratio in autistic patients (n=31) was significantly lower than that in control subjects (n=28). The decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio for the ACC was much greater in the group with worst social ability. NAA/Cr for the left DLPFC and social ability of autistic patients also correlated well. Furthermore, NAA/Cr for the left DLPFC in the group with intelligence quotient (IQ) below 50 was significantly less than in controls. NAA/Cr for the right DLPFC in autistic patients was not decreased compared to controls, and did not correlate with IQ or social ability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest neuronal dysfunction in the ACC and left DLPFC in autism, and also a relationship between social disability and metabolic dysfunction in these regions. Dysfunction in the ACC and the left DLPFC may contribute to the pathogenesis of autism.",M2
20227856,"Effects of antidepressant treatment on N-acetyl aspartate and choline levels in the hippocampus and thalami of post-stroke depression patients: a study using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Previous studies in patients with a major depressive disorder show functional abnormalities in the medial frontal cortex. Functional and structural abnormalities in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) are not well studied. The major goals of this study were to determine the biochemical abnormalities that occur in PSD and to assess the effect of antidepressants in patients with PSD at the biochemical level. We used magnetic resonance imaging to detect structural or functional abnormalities in PSD patients. In a prospective study, we included 30 patients with PSD and 20 age-matched subjects as controls. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) of the brain was conducted in all subjects at the beginning of the study. Patients with PSD were treated with the antidepressant paroxetine (20-40mg/days) for 6 months. After the 6-month period, all PSD subjects underwent MRS again. PSD patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) both before and after treatment with the antidepressant. The mean age of the PSD patients was 70.0+/-4.2 years and that of the controls was 67.2+/-5.4 years. Before treatment, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios in the bilateral hippocampus and thalami were significantly lower in PSD patients than in controls. Choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios were significantly higher in the bilateral hippocampus and left thalamus in PSD patients than in controls. The Cho/Cr ratios were significantly higher in the left thalamus than in the right in PSD patients. The HAMD scores were significantly correlated with the Cho/Cr ratios in the left and right hippocampus. Compared with PSD patients before antidepressant treatment, the PSD subjects after treatment had significantly higher NAA/Cr ratios in the left hippocampus and bilateral thalami. They had significantly lower Cho/Cr ratios in bilateral hippocampus and left thalamus. Our study suggests that metabolic abnormalities in the hippocampus and thalamus are implicated in PSD. Antidepressants may alter the local metabolic abnormalities in these areas.",M2
20227251,"Critical examination of a correlation between brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations and a personality trait of extroversion in healthy volunteers as measured by a 3 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.We hypothesized that brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels are associated with neuroticism, a trait associated with depression and anxiety disorders. We examined the correlation between brain GABA concentrations and the five factors included in the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) in healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) at 3 T. Forty-one healthy subjects (21 males, 20 females; age: 35+/-7 years) were enrolled in this study. Each subject underwent a 3T 1H-MRS study with a MEGA-PRESS sequence. Spectroscopy voxels (3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm) were placed in the frontal lobe and the parieto-occipital lobe. A negative correlation was found between the GABA/creatine ratios in the frontal lobe and scores of extroversion on the NEO-FFI. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons are related to personality traits of healthy subjects.",M2
20220018,"Noninvasive detection of presymptomatic and progressive neurodegeneration in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Recent studies with a conditional mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) suggest that neuronal dysfunction is reversible and neurodegeneration preventable with early interventions. Success of such interventions will depend on early detection of neuronal and glial abnormalities before cell loss and availability of objective methods to monitor progressive neurodegeneration. Cerebellar concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol, and glutamate as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) correlate with ataxia scores of patients with SCA1, indicating their potential as reliable biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Here we investigated whether neurochemical levels are altered by early, presymptomatic disease and whether they gauge disease progression in a mouse model of SCA1. Cerebellar neurochemical profiles of transgenic mice that overexpress the mutant human ataxin-1 (the SCA1[82Q] line) were measured longitudinally up to 1 year by MRS at 9.4 T and compared to those of transgenic mice that overexpress the normal human ataxin-1 (the SCA1[30Q] line) and wild-type controls. Multiple neurochemicals distinguished the SCA1[82Q] mice from controls with no overlap at all ages. Six neurochemicals were significantly different in SCA1[82Q] mice at 6 weeks, before major pathological and neurological changes. Alterations in NAA, myo-inositol, and glutamate progressively worsened and were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.0001) with disease progression as assessed by histology (molecular layer thickness and an overall severity score). Therefore, the neurochemicals that correlate with clinical status in patients reflected progressive pathology in the mouse model. These data demonstrate that presymptomatic and progressive neurodegeneration in SCA1 can be noninvasively monitored using MRS.",M2
20201852,"Neurochemistry of drug action: insights from proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and their relevance to addiction.Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H <e>MRS</e>) is a noninvasive imaging technique that permits measurement of particular compounds or metabolites within the tissue of interest. In the brain, (1)H MRS provides a snapshot of the neurochemical environment within a defined volume of interest. A search of the literature demonstrates the widespread utility of this technique for characterizing tumors, tracking the progress of neurodegenerative disease, and for understanding the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders. As of relatively recently, (1)H MRS has found its way into substance abuse research, and it is beginning to become recognized as a valuable complement in the brain imaging toolbox that also contains positron emission tomography, single-photon-emission computed tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Drug abuse studies using (1)H MRS have identified several biochemical changes in the brain. The most consistent alterations across drug class were reductions in N-acetylaspartate and elevations in myo-inositol, whereas changes in choline, creatine, and amino acid transmitters also were abundant. Together, the studies discussed herein provide evidence that drugs of abuse may have a profound effect on neuronal health, energy metabolism and maintenance, inflammatory processes, cell membrane turnover, and neurotransmission, and these biochemical changes may underlie the neuropathology within brain tissue that subsequently gives rise to the cognitive and behavioral impairments associated with drug addiction.",M2
20201639,"Anterior to posterior hippocampal <e>MRS</e> metabolite difference is mainly a partial volume effect.BACKGROUND: The concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in hippocampus, as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and the ratio of NAA/(choline (Cho) + creatine (Cr)) are valuable tools in the lateralization of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). MRS of hippocampus is also increasingly used to study certain psychiatric and degenerative diseases. However, the reliability of such measurements of hippocampus has been questioned. PURPOSE: To re-evaluate MRS imaging data from prior control subjects with regard to variation of metabolite concentrations in hippocampus from anterior to posterior and the partial volume (R)contribution to the measurements from adjacent tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects, mean age 33 years, were studied with MRS imaging. The measurement volume was angled along the temporal horns and metabolite concentration images were reconstructed at the MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the anterior, medial, and posterior parts of both hippocampi were evaluated. Signal normalization to the total MRS signal from all ROIs permitted pooling of individual data with different and unknown signal scaling. One subject was re-examined with a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) volume of the brain for evaluation of partial volumes in the MRS examination. RESULTS: Overall, there were significantly lower concentrations of NAA in the anterior parts, and of (Cho+Cr) in the posterior parts, while the NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratio in the posterior parts of the mesial temporal lobes was significantly higher. Hippocampus accounted for one-half, one-third, and one-quarter of the anterior, middle, and posterior ROIs, respectively. The NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratio thus showed a reverse relationship to the relative volume of hippocampal tissue within the ROI. CONCLUSION: Metabolite concentrations in the mesial temporal lobe obtained with MRS imaging represent the mean value of hippocampus and a considerable amount of adjacent tissue. To assess the hippocampus alone, an actual voxel well below 1 cm(3) and a sub-centimeter slice thickness are required.",M2
20191578,"Increased glutamate/glutamine compounds in the brains of patients with fibromyalgia: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) has been defined as a systemic disorder that is clinically characterized by pain, cognitive deficit, and the presence of associated psychopathology, all of which are suggestive of a primary brain dysfunction. This study was undertaken to identify the nature of this cerebral dysfunction by assessing the brain metabolite patterns in patients with FM through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) techniques. METHODS: A cohort of 28 female patients with FM and a control group of 24 healthy women of the same age were studied. MRS techniques were used to study brain metabolites in the amygdala, thalami, and prefrontal cortex of these women. RESULTS: In comparison with healthy controls, patients with FM showed higher levels of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) compounds (mean +/- SD 11.9 +/- 1.6 arbitrary units [AU] versus 13.4 +/- 1.7 AU in controls and patients, respectively; t = 2.517, 35 df, corrected P = 0.03) and a higher Glx:creatine ratio (mean +/- SD 2.1 +/- 0.4 versus 2.4 +/- 1.4, respectively; t = 2.373, 35 df, corrected P = 0.04) in the right amygdala. In FM patients with increased levels of pain intensity, greater fatigue, and more symptoms of depression, inositol levels in the right amygdala and right thalamus were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: The distinctive metabolic features found in the right amygdala of patients with FM suggest the possible existence of a neural dysfunction in emotional processing. The results appear to extend previous findings regarding the dysfunction in pain processing observed in patients with FM.",M2
20191074,"Assessing a dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) with 7T MR imaging.Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD; dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma) is a rare hamartomatous lesion of the cerebellar cortex and this was first described in 1920. LDD is considered to be part of the autosomal-dominant phacomatosis and cancer syndrome Cowden disease (CS). We examined the brain of a 46-year-old man, who displayed the manifestations of CS, with 7 Tesla (T) and 1.5 T MRI and 1.5 T MR spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>). We discuss the possible benefits of employing ultrahigh-field MRI for making the diagnosis of this rare lesion.",M2
20187223,"Improved multimodality imaging using alginate molding in xenograft tumor models.PURPOSE: To allow for reproducible rodent positioning using molding in multimodal tomographic imaging (positron emission tomography [PET], magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy [MRI/<e>MRS</e>]), minimization of magnetic field inhomogeneity during MRI investigations of peripheral structures, and reproducible positioning for subsequent histological sectioning of the separated tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical shift imaging (CSI) studies were carried out using phantoms and NMRI nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous tumors. For embedding, three different materials were used: 1) alginate, 2) gelatin, and 3) a mixture of wheat flour and salt. The animals were placed in an animal chamber including position markers visible by MRI and PET. The frozen embedded explanted tumors were sliced and examined autoradiographically as well as histologically. RESULTS: Alginate showed a substantial improvement of magnetic field homogeneity and histological sectioning was superior to the other methods. This embedding led to a significant reduction of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the water peak in the peripheral rim of the tumor in comparison to the same peak FWHM without embedding (41 +/- 10 Hz vs. 80 +/- 20 Hz). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that animal positioning in an imaging chamber together with alginate embedding allows high-quality multimodality investigations including coregistration of MRI/MRS, PET, and histological images.",M2
20182844,"Preliminary study of early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy after the first cycle in breast cancer: comparison of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of single-voxel (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) at 1.5 T to evaluate early responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy after the first treatment in breast cancer patients and to compare it to measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with breast cancer who were scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy were recruited. MR examination after the first cycle was scheduled for a few days before the administration of the second dose. RESULTS: Two patients were excluded from the study because their regimen was changed after the first cycle. MRS before chemotherapy demonstrated the presence of choline (Cho) at 3.22-3.23 ppm in six cases and at 3.27 ppm in one case. Diffusion-weighted MRI before chemotherapy demonstrated a localized high-signal lesion in all cases. The change of the integral value of Cho after the first cycle of chemotherapy showed a positive correlation with the change in lesion size (r = 0.91, P = 0.01), whereas no correlation was observed between the change of ADC values after the first cycle and the change in lesion size (r = 0.45, P = 0.32). CONCLUSION: MRS after the first cycle may be more sensitive to diffusion-weighted MRI to predict the pathological response.",M2
20181285,"SpectraClassifier 1.0: a user friendly, automated <e>MRS</e>-based classifier-development system.BACKGROUND: SpectraClassifier (SC) is a Java solution for designing and implementing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)-based classifiers. The main goal of SC is to allow users with minimum background knowledge of multivariate statistics to perform a fully automated pattern recognition analysis. SC incorporates feature selection (greedy stepwise approach, either forward or backward), and feature extraction (PCA). Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis is the method of choice for classification. Classifier evaluation is performed through various methods: display of the confusion matrix of the training and testing datasets; K-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and bootstrapping as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: SC is composed of the following modules: Classifier design, Data exploration, Data visualisation, Classifier evaluation, Reports, and Classifier history. It is able to read low resolution in-vivo MRS (single-voxel and multi-voxel) and high resolution tissue MRS (HRMAS), processed with existing tools (jMRUI, INTERPRET, 3DiCSI or TopSpin). In addition, to facilitate exchanging data between applications, a standard format capable of storing all the information needed for a dataset was developed. Each functionality of SC has been specifically validated with real data with the purpose of bug-testing and methods validation. Data from the INTERPRET project was used. CONCLUSIONS: SC is a user-friendly software designed to fulfil the needs of potential users in the MRS community. It accepts all kinds of pre-processed MRS data types and classifies them semi-automatically, allowing spectroscopists to concentrate on interpretation of results with the use of its visualisation tools.",M2
20170362,"Utility of functional imaging in prediction or assessment of treatment response and prognosis following thermotherapy.The purpose of this review is to examine the roles that functional imaging may play in prediction of treatment response and determination of overall prognosis in patients who are enrolled in thermotherapy trials, either in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both. Most of the historical work that has been done in this field has focused on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI/<e>MRS</e>) methods, so the emphasis will be there, although some discussion of the role that positron emission tomography (PET) might play will also be examined. New optical technologies also hold promise for obtaining low cost, yet valuable physiological data from optically accessible sites. The review is organised by traditional outcome parameters: local response, local control and progression-free or overall survival. Included in the review is a discussion of future directions for this type of translational work.",M2
20170295,"Metabolite concentrations in supraventricular white matter from teenage to early old age: A short echo time 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) study.BACKGROUND: Age- and sex-related changes of metabolites in healthy adult brains have been examined with different (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods in varying populations, and with differing results. A long repetition time and short echo time technique reduces quantification errors due to T(1) and T(2) relaxation effects and makes it possible to measure metabolites with short T(2) relaxation times. PURPOSE: To examine the effect of age on the metabolite concentrations measured by (1)H MRS in normal supraventricular white matter using a long repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supraventricular white matter of 57 healthy subjects (25 women, 32 men), aged 13 to 72 years, was examined with a single-voxel MRS at 1.5T using a TR of 6000 ms and a TE of 22 ms. Tissue water was used as a reference in quantification. Results: Myoinositol increased slightly and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) decreased slightly with increasing age. Glutamine/glutamate complex (Glx) showed U-shaped age dependence, with highest concentrations in the youngest and oldest subjects. No significant age dependence was found in total choline and total creatine. No gender differences were found. Macromolecule/ lipid (ML) fractions were reliably measurable only in 36/57 or even fewer subjects and showed very large deviations. CONCLUSION: The concentrations of several metabolites in cerebral supraventricular white matter are age dependent on (1)H MRS, even in young and middle-aged people, and age dependency can be nonlinear. Each (1)H MRS study of the brain should therefore take age into account, whereas sex does not appear to be so important. The use of macromolecule and lipid evaluations is compromised by less successful quantification and large variations in healthy people.",M2
20159434,"Intracerebral blood and <e>MRS</e> in neonatal nonketotic hyperglycinemia.Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an inborn error of glycine metabolism leading to the accumulation of glycine in the brain. The neonatal form presents in the first days after birth with encephalopathy, seizures. and characteristic  hiccups.  Rapid progression can lead to intractable seizures, coma, and respiratory failure. The outcome is invariably poor, and many die before age 1 year. The diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia is traditionally based on the finding of a raised cerebrospinal fluid-to-plasma-glycine ratio. An elevated glycine peak, using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is also specific to nonketotic hyperglycinemia. The presence of blood in a cerebrospinal fluid sample is known to render the glycine level uninterpretable. However, there have been no reports of intracerebral blood confounding the cerebral glycine detected on long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report on an infant who presented with neonatal encephalopathy and imaging findings consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, as well as intracerebral hemorrhage and an abnormal glycine peak on spectroscopy. The source of the abnormal glycine on long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was intracerebral blood, highlighting an important confounder in the interpretation of long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in suspected nonketotic hyperglycinemia.",M2
20153149,"High energy phosphate abnormalities normalize after antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia: a longitudinal 31P <e>MRS</e> study of basal ganglia.We reported increased high-energy phosphate metabolism in the basal ganglia of antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients using (31)P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). These patients were followed up for 1 year and and reassessed using (31)P MRS. Fourteen (8 males) patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia and 14 (11 males) healthy controls underwent (31)P MRS of sub-cortical structures (predominantly basal ganglia) twice (mean+/-S.D. interscan interval 1.15+/-0.17year) on a 1.5T scanner. Total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) decreased significantly after treatment in schizophrenia patients. Patients had significantly lower mean PCr/ATP ratios than healthy controls at baseline but not during the follow-up. In patients, there was a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of improvement in PANSS total scores and the extent of change in the PCr/ATP ratio. Findings support the hypothesis that reduction of energy demand or induction of decreased energy-demanding processes might underlie the mechanism of action of antipsychotics in schizophrenia.",M2
20153148,"Short-TE proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigation in adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.In this study, short echo time (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) was applied for quantification of neurometabolites using the LC Model algorithm in Taiwanese adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Proton magnetic resonance spectra were acquired bilaterally on the prefrontal area (part of the anterior cingulate gyrus and part of the medial frontal gyrus) in 15 adolescents with ADHD (average age of 13.88years) and 22 controls (average age of 14.85years). Absolute metabolite levels and ratios relative to creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr) were obtained to be compared between groups. Results showed that adolescents with ADHD had significantly lower mean right prefrontal levels of Cr+PCr as compared with the controls. No significant differences between groups were noted in the remainder of the prefrontal metabolites. As for the group comparison of relative ratios, the N-acetylaspartate/Cr+PCr ratio was significantly higher in the right prefrontal regions of ADHD adolescents. This finding provides evidence of a right prefrontal neurochemical alteration in ADHD adolescents, which is consistent with current ADHD theory of prefrontal neuropathology with developmental mechanism. In addition, it highlights the importance of the method in interpretation of MRS findings in the context of ADHD.",M2
20151771,"Feasibility of assessing liver lipid by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in healthy normal and overweight prepubertal children.BACKGROUND: Intramyocellular and intrahepatic (IHL) lipids are significantly associated with insulin resistance in adults and adolescents and may represent an early marker for developing the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. METHODS: During the pilot phase of a larger cross-sectional study, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) to determine the feasibility of noninvasively evaluating IHL in 11 male (n = 4) and female (n = 7) prepubertal children using a standard clinical system and to determine whether IHL is correlated with adiposity, fasting insulin and glucose, and liver enzymes. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) (range, 13.4-32.4 kg/m(2)) and IHL stores (range, 0.07-3.2% relative to an oil phantom) were variable. IHL was correlated with body mass (r = 0.66, P = 0.037), BMI (r = 0.73, P = 0.016), percentage body fat (r = 0.73, P = 0.01, n = 10), waist circumference (r = 0.85, P = 0.016), and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (r = 0.77, P = 0.03) but was not significantly correlated with other markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase activity (r = 0.59, P = 0.09, n = 9) and alkaline phosphatase concentrations (r = 0.60, P = 0.087). IHL was also (P &lt; 0.01) correlated with fasting insulin concentration (r = 0.85, P = 0.03, n = 6) and insulin resistance (r = 0.94, P = 0.006, n = 6), but these correlations were driven by the results for one child. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that (1)H-MRS obtained in a standard pediatric clinical environment may be used to determine IHL in healthy normal and overweight prepubertal youth. This noninvasive technique may prove useful in identifying early markers of the metabolic syndrome in at-risk youth.",M2
20150369,"Noninvasive detection of temozolomide in brain tumor xenografts by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Poor drug delivery to brain tumors caused by aberrant tumor vasculature and a partly intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) can significantly impair the efficacy of chemotherapy. Determining drug delivery to brain tumors is a challenging problem, and the noninvasive detection of drug directly in the tumor can be critically important for accessing, predicting, and eventually improving effectiveness of therapy. In this study, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) was used to detect an anticancer agent, temozolomide (TMZ), in vivo in murine xenotransplants of U87MG human brain cancer. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the low-molecular-weight contrast agent, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA), was used to evaluate tumor vascular parameters. Carbon-13-labeled TMZ ([(13)C]TMZ, 99%) was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of approximately 140 mg/kg (450 mg/m(2), well within the maximal clinical dose of 1000 mg/m(2) used in humans) during the course of in vivo MRS experiments. Heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) MRS of brain tumors was performed before and after i.p. administration of [(13)C]TMZ. Dynamic MRI experiments demonstrated slower recovery of MRI signal following an intravenous bolus injection of GdDTPA, higher vascular flow and volume obtained by T*(2)-weighted MRI, as well as enhanced uptake of the contrast agent in the brain tumor compared with normal brain detected by T(1)-weighted MRI. These data demonstrate partial breakdown of the BBB/BTB and good vascularization in U87MG xenografts. A [(13)C]TMZ peak was detected at 3.9 ppm by HMQC from a selected volume of about 0.15 cm(3) within the brain tumor with HMQC pulse sequences. This study clearly demonstrates the noninvasive detection of [(13)C]TMZ in xenografted U87MG brain tumors with MRS. Noninvasive tracking of antineoplastic agents using MRS can have a significant impact on brain tumor chemotherapy.",M2
20145128,"Noninvasive detection of target modulation following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Numerous mechanism-based anticancer drugs that target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are in clinical trials. However, it remains challenging to assess responses by traditional imaging methods. Here, we show for the first time the efficacy of hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) in detecting the effect of PI3K inhibition by monitoring hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]lactate levels produced from hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. In GS-2 glioblastoma cells, PI3K inhibition by LY294002 or everolimus caused hyperpolarized lactate to drop to 42 +/- 12% and to 76 +/- 5%, respectively. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, hyperpolarized lactate dropped to 71 +/- 15% after treatment with LY294002. These reductions were correlated with reductions in LDH activity to 48 +/- 4%, 63 +/- 4%, and 69 +/- 12%, respectively, and were associated with a drop in levels of LDHA mRNA and LDHA and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha proteins. Supporting these findings, tumor growth inhibition achieved by everolimus in murine GS-2 xenografts was associated with a drop in the hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio detected by in vivo MRS imaging, whereas an increase in this ratio occurred with tumor growth in control animals. Taken together, our findings illustrate the application of hyperpolarized (13)C MRS of pyruvate to monitor alterations in LDHA activity and expression caused by PI3K pathway inhibition, showing the potential of this method for noninvasive imaging of drug target modulation.",M2
20138102,"Hypothalamic glutamate levels following serotonergic stimulation: a pilot study using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy in healthy volunteers.INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: Functional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) can be applied to measure pharmacodynamic effects of central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs. The serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), administered together with carbidopa and granisetron to improve kinetics and reduce adverse effects, acutely enhances central serotonergic neurotransmission and induces hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-(HPA) axis activation. We studied the hypothalamic levels of glutamate/glutamine (Glx), choline (Chol), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine using 7-Tesla (7T) MRS, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in peripheral blood, after the administration of the 5-HTP function test in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study was performed in 12 healthy males with a 7day wash-out period. After administration of the oral 5-HTP function test, ACTH and cortisol were measured over 4h and MRS scans at 7T were performed every 30min over 3h measuring Glx:Creatine, Chol:Creatine and NAA:Creatine ratios. RESULTS: In the hypothalamus, the administration of 5-HTP had no effect on the average Glx, Chol or NAA levels over 180min but induced a significant decrease of Glx at 60min on post-hoc analysis. 5-HTP-induced significant ACTH release reaching an E(max) of 60.2ng/L at 80min followed by cortisol with an E(max) of 246.4ng/mL at 110min. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in hypothalamic Glx levels after serotonergic stimulation is compatible with activation of excitatory neurons in this region, which is expected to cause depletion of local glutamate stores. The hypothalamic MRS-response reached its maximum prior to subsequent increases of ACTH and cortisol, which support the functional relevance of hypothalamic Glx-depletion for activation of the HPA-axis. This exploratory study shows that MRS is capable of detecting neuronal activation following functional stimulation of a targeted brain area.",M2
20136613,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in myocardial disease.31-phosphorous ((31)P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) is a technique that allows the noninvasive characterization of the biochemical and metabolic state of the myocardium in vivo. MRS is a pure form of molecular imaging using magnetic resonance signals from nuclei with nuclear spin to assess cardiac metabolism without the need for external radioactive tracers. (31)P MRS provides information on the underlying metabolic abnormalities that are fundamental to common conditions including ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, hypertrophy and valvular disease. (31)P MRS could potentially also have a role to play in assessing response to therapy as well as the effectiveness of metabolic modulating agents. However, the use of MRS is currently limited to research due to its poor reproducibility, low spatial and temporal resolution, and long acquisition times. With technical advances in both the spectrometers and postprocessing, MRS is likely to play a role in the future of multimodal noninvasive cardiac assessment.",M2
20124393,"A novel application of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy: non-invasive identification of spermatogenesis in men with non-obstructive azoospermia.BACKGROUND: About 10% of infertile men have no sperm in their ejaculate due to poor or absent spermatogenesis, also known as non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Testis (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) is a non-invasive imaging tool that can potentially identify and localize spermatogenesis in the testis. This study sought to identify metabolic signatures associated with various histological states of spermatogenesis in infertile men. METHODS: Quantitative high resolution magic angle spinning spectroscopy was performed on snap frozen testicular tissue from 27 men with three classic histological patterns: (i) normal spermatogenesis (men with prior paternity undergoing vasectomy reversal), (ii) maturation arrest (early or late, MA) or (iii) Sertoli-cell only (SCO). Concentrations of 19 tissue metabolites were acquired from each biopsy specimen. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine inter-group differences in metabolite concentrations among the three histologic groups. RESULTS: Phosphocholine (PC) and taurine tissue concentrations were significantly different between normal and SCO tissue. Mean PC concentrations were three times higher in normal testes compared with SCO (5.4 +/- 1.4 versus 1.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg; P = 0.01). No differences in metabolite concentrations were observed between normal and MA testes or between SCO and MA testes. Further histologic stratification of MA testes into subsets of those with (early) and without (late) spermatids or mature sperm, identified differences in PC concentrations. A predictive model for sperm presence with (1)H-MRS was developed based upon PC tissue concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: PC concentrations are significantly higher in testes with spermatogenesis. This suggests that a unique metabolic signature for spermatogenesis is possible using (1)H-MRS which could aid in the non-invasive diagnosis of sperm in men with NOA.",M2
20122519,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of musculoskeletal lesions at 3 T with metabolite quantification.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether proton MR spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) at 3 T with metabolite quantification is helpful for characterizing musculoskeletal lesions and to reveal whether the concentration of choline is correlated with the pathologic degree of malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three-tesla MR images and proton MRS data from 27 consecutive patients with surgically proven musculoskeletal lesions were retrospectively analyzed. We analyzed the presence of choline peaks of malignant tumors according to the degree of malignancies, and we compared them with those of benign lesions. The concentrations of choline calculated by means of the linear combination of model spectra were also compared with respect to the degree of malignancy in each group. RESULTS: The proton MRS had an overall sensitivity of 68.4%, specificity of 87.5%, positive predictive value of 92.3%, and negative predictive value of 53.8% for the detection of choline compounds. The positive detection rate for choline compounds in the primary malignancy group (53.8%) was lower than that of the metastasis group (100%). All false-negative results were shown in the Grade 1 primary malignancy group. There was no difference in the concentration of choline compounds with respect to the pathologic degree of differentiation. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy at 3 T with metabolite quantification is a helpful method that shows high specificity (87.5%) in characterizing musculoskeletal lesions, even though its sensitivity (68.4%) is relatively low. Grade 1 primary malignancies of bone and soft tissue tumor have a high potential for producing false-negative results.",M2
20120211,"Brain white matter 1 H <e>MRS</e> in Leber optic neuropathy mutation carriers.OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that proton MR spectroscopic (1H MRS) profile of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) mutation carriers group (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic) differs from group of healthy individuals and to determine metabolite or ratio that contributes most to differentiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed single voxel 1H MRS in normal appearing white matter of eighteen LHON mtDNA mutation carriers bearing one of three LHON mtDNA point mutations and in fifty control subjects. RESULTS: ANOVA showed significant difference for absolute concentration of creatine (Cr) (p &lt; 0.01) and N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio (NAA/Cr) (p &lt; 0.01). Discriminant analysis revealed that decreased absolute Cr followed by decreased absolute NAA concentration have the most significant contribution in discriminating LHON mutation carriers from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Abnormal metabolic profile in normal appearing white matter on MR imaging seems to be significantly present in LHON mutation carriers.",M2
20120007,"Non-invasive detection and quantification of human foetal brain lactate in utero by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of foetal cerebral lactate detection and quantification by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) in pregnancies at increased risk of cerebral hypoxia, using a clinical 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. METHOD: Localised (1)H-MRS was performed in four patients with pregnancies in their third trimester complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A long echo time (TE) of 288 ms was used to maximise detection and conspicuity of the lactate methyl resonance, together with a short TE MRS acquisition to check for the presence of lipid contamination. Individual peaks in the resulting spectra were measured, corrected for relaxation and referenced to the unsuppressed water signal to provide metabolite concentrations. RESULTS: A resonance peak consistent with the presence of lactate was observed in all cases. In one subject, this was confounded by the identification of significant lipid contamination in the short TE MRS acquisition. The range of measured lactate concentrations was 2.0-3.3 mmol/kg and compared well with preterm neonatal MRS studies. CONCLUSION: The non-invasive detection and quantification of foetal cerebral lactate by MRS is achievable on a clinical 1.5 T MRI system.",M2
20109726,"Novel imaging techniques as response biomarkers in cervical cancer.The use of novel imaging techniques that have the ability to evaluate tumour biology and function shows a great deal of promise in providing early surrogate biomarkers of response to therapy which may allow for individualised or patient-specific regimes. This would have considerable clinical benefit in allowing for a treatment regimen tailored accordingly to meet the expected response, thereby reducing morbidity. Several of these imaging modalities such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI), MR spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are now being introduced into the field of gynaecological oncology, with the majority of work being performed on cervical tumours.

20107138,"Spinal cord repair in MS: does mitochondrial metabolism play a role?OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms of spinal cord repair and their relative contribution to clinical recovery in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) after a cervical cord relapse, using spinal cord (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) and volumetric imaging. METHODS: Fourteen patients with MS and 13 controls underwent spinal cord imaging at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) concentration, which reflects axonal count and metabolism in mitochondria, and the cord cross-sectional area, which indicates axonal count, were measured in the affected cervical region. Mixed effect linear regression models investigated the temporal evolution of these measures and their association with clinical changes. Ordinal logistic regressions identified predictors of recovery. RESULTS: Patients who recovered showed a sustained increase in NAA after 1 month. In the whole patient group, a greater increase of NAA after 1 month was associated with greater recovery. Patients showed a significant decline in cord area during follow-up, which did not correlate with clinical changes. A worse recovery was predicted by a longer disease duration at study entry. CONCLUSIONS: The partial recovery of N-acetyl-aspartate levels after the acute event, which is concurrent with a decline in cord cross-sectional area, may be driven by increased axonal mitochondrial metabolism. This possible repair mechanism is associated with clinical recovery, and is less efficient in patients with longer disease duration. These insights into the mechanisms of spinal cord repair highlight the need to extend spinal cord magnetic resonance spectroscopy to other spinal cord disorders, and explore therapies that enhance recovery by modulating mitochondrial activity.",M2
20100055,"Controlled radio-frequency hyperthermia using an MR scanner and simultaneous monitoring of temperature and therapy response by (1)H, (23)Na and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in subcutaneously implanted 9L-gliosarcoma.A magnetic resonance (MR) technique is developed to produce controlled radio-frequency (RF) hyperthermia (HT) in subcutaneously-implanted 9L-gliosarcoma in Fisher rats using an MR scanner and its components; the scanner is also simultaneously used to monitor the tumour temperature and the metabolic response of the tumour to the therapy. The method uses the (1)H chemical shift of thulium 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetra-acetic acid (TmDOTA(-)) to monitor temperature. The desired HT temperature is achieved and maintained using a feedback loop mechanism that uses a proportional-integral-derivative controller. The RF HT technique was able to heat the tumour from 33 degrees to 45 degrees C in approximately 10 min and was able to maintain the tumour temperature within +/-0.2 degrees C of the target temperature (45 degrees C). Simultaneous monitoring of the metabolic changes with RF HT showed increases in total tissue and intracellular Na(+) as measured by single-quantum and triple-quantum filtered (23)Na MR spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>), respectively, and decreases in intra- and extracellular pH and cellular bioenergetics as measured by (31)P MRS. Monitoring of metabolic response in addition to the tumour temperature measurements may serve as a more reliable and early indicator of therapy response. In addition, such measurements during HT treatment will enhance our understanding of the tumour response mechanisms during HT, which may prove valuable in designing methods to improve therapeutic efficiency.",M2
20099342,"Study of the features of proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.PURPOSE: To study the features of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and its relation with clinical scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with definite or probable ALS and 15 age- and gender-matched normal controls were enrolled. (1)H-MRS was performed on a 3.0 Tesla GE imaging system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). TE-averaged Point Resolved Selective Spectroscopy was used. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), Glu, and Glx (glutamate + glutamine) values of the motor cortex and posterior limb of internal capsule were acquired. The t-test was used to compare differences between groups, and the correlations between the above values and clinical scale were analyzed. RESULTS: The motor area and posterior limb of the internal capsule of ALS patients had lower NAA/Cr (1.91 +/- 0.34, 1.53 +/- 0.17) compared with normal subjects (2.23 +/- 0.33, 1.66 +/- 0.07), and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01, 0.01). ALS patients had higher Glu/Cr (0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.29 +/- 0.06) and Glx/Cr (0.40 +/- 0.04, 0.33 +/- 0.06) compared with normal subjects (0.30 +/- 0.03, 0.25 +/- 0.04) and (0.32 +/- 0.05, 0.26 +/- 0.03), and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01, 0.01). The Norris scale was negatively correlated with Glx/Cr of primary motor cortex by lineal correlation analysis (r = -0.75), and this correlation had statistical significance (F = 16.60; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neuronal loss and Glu+Gln increase can be detected by using proton MRS in ALS patients. (1)H-MRS is an useful tool in reflecting the characteristic changes of metabolite in ALS.",M2
20099340,"Correlations between in vivo (1)H <e>MRS</e> and ex vivo (1)H HRMAS metabolite measurements in adult human gliomas.PURPOSE: To assess how accurately ex vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) from small biopsy tissues relate to in vivo (1)H MRS (from larger tumor volumes) in human astrocytomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo (PRESS, TE = 30 msec) and ex vivo (presaturation) (1)H spectra of 17 human astrocytomas (4 grade II, 1 grade III and 12 glioblastomas) were quantified using LCModel. Concentrations of 11 metabolites and 2 lipid/macromolecules were retrospectively compared, with histogram analysis of the in vivo MRI data used to evaluate tumor heterogeneity. RESULTS: For homogeneous-appearing tumors, significant correlations were found between in vivo and ex vivo (1)H MRS concentrations of those metabolites known to be metabolically stable in postmortem tissues (eg, creatine, myo-inositol, total cholines, and the approximately 1.3 and 0.9 ppm lipids). Anaerobic glycolysis during biopsy surgical removal depletes the tissue of glucose, increasing alanine and lactate, and resulted in no correlation between these in vivo and ex vivo metabolite concentrations. CONCLUSION: Within defined limitations, ex vivo astrocytoma biopsy HRMAS (1)H spectra have similar metabolic profiles to that obtained in vivo and therefore detailed ex vivo characterization of glioma biopsies can directly relate to the original tumor.",M2
20099324,"High-resolution <e>MRS</e> in the presence of field inhomogeneity via intermolecular double-quantum coherences on a 3-T whole-body scanner.Signals from intermolecular double-quantum coherences (iDQCs) have been shown to be insensitive to macroscopic field inhomogeneities and thus enable acquisition of high- resolution MR spectroscopy in the presence of large inhomogeneous fields. In this paper, localized iDQC (1)H spectroscopy on a whole-body 3-T MR scanner is reported. Experiments with a brain metabolite phantom were performed to quantify characteristics of the iDQC signal under different conditions. The feasibility of in vivo iDQC high-resolution MR spectroscopy in the presence of large intrinsic and external field inhomogeneity (in the order of hundreds of hertz) was demonstrated in the whole cerebellum of normal volunteers in a scan time of about 6.5 min. Major metabolite peaks were well resolved in the reconstructed one-dimensional spectra projected from two-dimensional iDQC acquisitions. Investigations on metabolite ratios, signal-to-noise ratio, and line width were performed and compared with results obtained with conventional point-resolved spectroscopy/MR spectroscopy in homogeneous fields. Metabolite ratios from iDQC results showed excellent consistency under different in vitro and in vivo conditions, and they were similar to those from point-resolved spectroscopy with small voxel sizes in homogeneous fields. MR spectroscopy with iDQCs can be applied potentially for quantification of gross metabolite changes due to diseases in large brain volumes with high field inhomogeneity.",M2
20093832,"Role of myo-inositol by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore the potential value of myo-inositol (mIns), which is regarded as a biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, in APP/PS1 transgenic (tg) mice detected by (1)H-<e>MRS</e>. METHODS:(1)H-MRS was performed in 30 APP/PS1 tg mice and 20 wild-type (wt) littermates at 3, 5 and 8 months of age. Areas under the peak of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), mIns and creatine (Cr) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were measured, and the NAA/Cr and mIns/Cr ratios were analyzed quantitatively. RESULTS: Compared with the wt mice, the mIns/Cr ratio of the 3-month-old tg mice was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05), and pathology showed activation and proliferation of astrocytes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The concentration of NAA was significantly lower at 8 and 8 months of age (p &lt; 0.05). According to the threshold of mIns/Cr that was adopted to separate the tg from the wt mice, the rate of correct predictions was 82, 94 and 95%, respectively, for 3, 5 and 8 months. CONCLUSION: Of the early AD metabolites as detected by (1)H-MRS, mIns is the most valuable marker for assessment of AD. Quantitative analysis of mIns may provide important clues for early diagnosis of AD.",M2
20092374,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the distinction of high-grade cerebral gliomas from single metastatic brain tumors.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases and primary high-grade gliomas, including glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), may be indistinguishable by conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Identification of these tumors may have therapeutic consequences. PURPOSE: To assess the value of MR spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) using short and intermediate echo time (TE) in differentiating solitary brain metastases and high-grade gliomas on the basis of differences in metabolite ratios in the intratumoral and peritumoral region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed MR imaging and MRS in 73 patients with histologically verified intraaxial brain tumors: 53 patients with high-grade gliomas (34 GBM and 19 AA) and 20 patients with metastatic brain tumors. The metabolite ratios of Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr at intermediate TE and the presence of lipids at short TE were assessed from spectral maps in the tumoral core, peritumoral edema, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. The differences in the metabolite ratios between high-grade gliomas/GBM/AA and metastases were analyzed statistically. Cutoff values of Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr ratios in the peritumoral edema, as well as Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios in the tumoral core for distinguishing high-grade gliomas/GBM/AA from metastases were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted in the peritumoral Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/ Cr ratios between high-grade gliomas/GBM/AA and metastases. ROC analysis demonstrated a cutoff value of 1.24 for peritumoral Cho/Cr ratio to provide sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of 100%, 88.9%, 80.0%, and 100%, respectively, for discrimination between high-grade gliomas and metastases. By using a cutoff value of 1.11 for peritumoral Cho/NAA ratio, the sensitivity was 100%, the specificity was 91.1%, the PPV was 83.3%, and the NPV was 100%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that MRS can differentiate high-grade gliomas from metastases, especially with peritumoral measurements, supporting the hypothesis that MRS can detect infiltration of tumor cells in the peritumoral edema.",M2
20082417,"Effects of stimulation frequency and pulse duration on fatigue and metabolic cost during a single bout of neuromuscular electrical stimulation.We have investigated the effects of stimulation frequency and pulse duration on fatigue and energy metabolism in rat gastrocnemius muscle during a single bout of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Electrical pulses were delivered at 100 Hz (1-ms pulse duration) and 20 Hz (5-ms pulse duration) for the high (HF) and low (LF) frequency protocols, respectively. As a standardization procedure, the averaged stimulation intensity, the averaged total charge, the initial peak torque, the duty cycle, the contraction duration and the torque-time integral were similar in both protocols. Fatigue was assessed using two testing trains delivered at a frequency of 100 Hz and 20 Hz before and after each protocol. Metabolic changes were investigated in vivo using 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-<e>MRS</e>) and in vitro in freeze-clamped muscles. Both LF and HF NMES protocols induced the same decrease in testing trains and metabolic changes. We conclude that, under carefully controlled and comparable conditions, the use of low stimulation frequency and long pulse duration do not minimize the occurrence of muscle fatigue or affect the corresponding stimulation-induced metabolic changes so that this combination of stimulation parameters would not be adequate in the context of rehabilitation.",M2
20079155,"Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors: magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy evaluation.BACKGROUND: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is a rare benign neoplasm of the central nervous system affecting young people. A correct preoperative diagnosis is helpful for planning surgical strategies and improving prognosis. The purpose of this study was to characterize DNTs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) and to analyze the value of these two techniques in the diagnosis of DNTs. METHODS: MR images of 13 patients with DNTs were reviewed retrospectively; and five of the patients also underwent MRS. Tumors were confirmed by surgery. The distribution, extension and signal features of the lesions were assessed, and the MRS results were analyzed. RESULTS: All tumors were supratentorial. The cortex was the main area involved, with nine tumors located in the temporal lobe, three in the frontal lobe, and one on the boundary between the temporal and occipital lobes. All cases had decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. On fluid attenuated inversion recovery weighted images, the hyperintense  ring sign  and internal septation of the lesion were seen in 9 cases. Eight tumors had well-demarcated borders. Peritumoral edema or mass effect was absent in all cases. A contrast enhancement examination was performed in 9 cases. Contrast enhancement was absent in five cases, and four cases showed significant enhancement. The MRS showed a low N-acetylaspartate peak and a lack of elevated choline-containing component (Cho) or Cho-Cr ratio (Cho/Cr) in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: The MRI findings of DNTs were stereotypical. The combination of MRI and MRS techniques were helpful in making a correct presurgical diagnosis.",M2
20071119,"Quantitative multivoxel proton chemical shift imaging of the breast.The study of focal pathology by single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) is hampered by the impossibility to study tissue heterogeneity or compare the metabolite signals in breast lesion directly to those in unaffected tissue. Multivoxel MRS studies, while potentially allowing for truly quantitative tissue characterization, have up to now also been far from quantitative with, for example, the signal-to-noise ratio of the choline (Cho) signal serving as measure of tumor activity. Shown in this study is that in a standard clinical setting with a regular 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, it is possible to perform quantitative multivoxel MRS. With the use of literature values for the T1 and T2 relaxation times of Cho and water in fibroglandular breast tissue and tumors, one can determine the concentrations of Cho in different tumor compartments and surrounding tissues in two brief multivoxel MRS measurements. This opens excellent perspectives to quantitative diagnostic and follow-up studies of focal pathology such as lesions suspected of breast cancer.",M2
20060132,"Methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, lowers brain glutamine and glutamate in a mouse model of ALS.In an effort to alter the levels of neurochemicals involved in excitotoxicity, we treated mice with methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Since glutamate toxicity has been proposed as a mechanism for the degeneration of motor neurons in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, we tested the effects of MSO on the transgenic mouse that overexpresses the mutant human SOD1(G93A) gene, an animal model for the primary inherited form of the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This treatment in vivo reduced glutamine synthetase activity measured in vitro by 85%. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, with magic angle spinning of intact samples of brain tissue, showed that MSO treatment reduced brain levels of glutamine by 60% and of glutamate by 30% in both the motor cortex and the anterior striatum, while also affecting levels of GABA and glutathione. Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis revealed that MSO treatment significantly extended the lifespan of these mice by 8% (p&lt;0.01). These results show that in the SOD1(G93A) model of neurodegenerative diseases, the concentration of brain glutamate (determined with (1)H-<e>MRS</e>) can be lowered by inhibiting in vivo the synthesis of glutamine with non-toxic doses of MSO.",M2
20052547,"A new case of GABA transaminase deficiency facilitated by proton MR spectroscopy.BACKGROUND: Deficiency of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-T) is a rare disorder of GABA catabolism, with only a single sibship reported. We report on a third case, a Japanese female infant with severe psychomotor retardation and recurrent episodic lethargy with intractable seizures, with the diagnosis facilitated by proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>). METHODS: Neuroimaging was performed at the first episode of lethargy. For (1)H-MRS, locations were placed in the semioval center and the basal ganglia. Quantification of metabolite concentrations were derived using the LCModel. We confirmed the diagnosis subsequently by enzyme and molecular studies, which involved direct DNA sequence analysis and the development of a novel multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification test. RESULTS: (1)H-MRS analysis revealed an elevated GABA concentration in the basal ganglia (2.9 mmol/l). Based on the results of quantitative (1)H-MRS and clinical findings, GABA-T deficiency was suspected and confirmed in cultured lymphoblasts. Molecular studies of the GABA-T gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a deletion of one exon and a missense mutation, 275G&gt;A, which was not detected in 210 control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that excessive prenatal GABA exposure in the central nervous system (CNS) was responsible for the clinical manifestations of GABA transaminase deficiency. Our findings suggest the dual nature of GABA as an excitatory molecule early in life, followed by a functional switch to an inhibitory species later in development. Furthermore, quantitative (1)H-MRS appears to be a useful, noninvasive tool for detecting inborn errors of GABA metabolism in the CNS.",M2
20051687,"Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with a V180I mutation: comparative analysis with pathological findings and diffusion-weighted images.BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been reported to be a useful technique for diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The present study reported DWI results in cases of familial CJD with a V180I mutation (CJD180) in the prion protein gene as well as neurological findings. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 3 patients with V180I was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, brain MRI, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) were included. CSF was analyzed for biochemical markers, and each patient underwent brain MRI, SPECT, and MRS analysis. A brain biopsy from the frontal cortex, which corresponded to the area of increased DWI signals, was utilized for neuropathological analysis. RESULTS: CSF analysis results revealed elevated total tau protein and the absence of 14-3-3 protein, as well as decreased concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, S100 protein, and prostaglandin E(2). All patients presented with unique MRI features. Brain biopsy showed severe spongiform morphology, but comparatively preserved neurons and mild astrocytic gliosis. Accumulations of PrP(Sc) were not detected using the 3F4 antibody, and microglial activation was subtle. SPECT revealed hypoperfusion throughout both hemispheres. MRS revealed a reduced N-acetyl aspartate/creatine ratio. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggested that increased DWI signals could reflect severe spongiform changes in CJD180 patients.",M2
20043062,"High-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects glycine as a biomarker in brain tumors.The non-essential amino acid neurotransmitter glycine (Gly) may serve as a biomarker for brain tumors. Using 36 biopsies from patients with brain tumors [12 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); 10 low-grade (LG), including 7 schwannoma and 3 pylocytic astrocytoma; 7 meningioma (MN); 7 brain metastases (MT), including 3 adenocarcinoma and 4 breast cancer] and 9 control biopsies from patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of glycine may distinguish among these brain tumor types. Using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>), we determined a theoretically optimum echo time (TE) of 50 ms for distinguishing Gly signals from overlapping myo-inositol (Myo) signals and tested our methodology in phantom and biopsy specimens. Quantitative analysis revealed higher levels of Gly in tumor biopsies (all combined) relative to controls; Gly levels were significantly elevated in LG, MT and GBM biopsies (P&lt;or=0.05). Residual Myo levels were elevated in LG and MT and reduced in MN and GBM (P&lt;0.05 vs. control levels). We observed higher levels of Gly in GBM as compared to LG tumors (P=0.05). Meanwhile, although Gly levels in GBM and MT did not differ significantly from each other, the Gly:Myo ratio did distinguish GBM from MT (P&lt;0.003) and from all other groups, a distinction that has not been adequately made previously. We conclude from these findings that Gly can serve as a biomarker for brain tumors and that the Gly:Myo ratio may be a useful index for brain tumor classification.",M2
20043005,"Neurochemical alterations in methamphetamine-dependent patients treated with cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline: a longitudinal proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.Cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), as an important intermediate for major membrane phospholipids, may exert neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative disorders. This longitudinal proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) study aimed to examine whether a 4-week CDP-choline treatment could alter neurometabolite levels in patients with methamphetamine (MA) dependence and to investigate whether changes in neurometabolite levels would be associated with MA use. We hypothesized that the prefrontal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a neuronal marker, and choline-containing compound (Cho), which are related to membrane turnover, would increase with CDP-choline treatment in MA-dependent patients. We further hypothesized that this increase would correlate with the total number of negative urine results. Thirty-one treatment seekers with MA dependence were randomly assigned to receive CDP-choline (n=16) or placebo (n=15) for 4 weeks. Prefrontal NAA and Cho levels were examined using (1)H-MRS before medication, and at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Generalized estimating equation regression analyses showed that the rate of change in prefrontal NAA (p=0.005) and Cho (p=0.03) levels were greater with CDP-choline treatment than with placebo. In the CDP-choline-treated patients, changes in prefrontal NAA levels were positively associated with the total number of negative urine results (p=0.03). Changes in the prefrontal Cho levels, however, were not associated with the total number of negative urine results. These preliminary findings suggest that CDP-choline treatment may exert potential neuroprotective effects directly or indirectly because of reductions in drug use by the MA-dependent patients. Further studies with a larger sample size of MA-dependent patients are warranted to confirm a long-term efficacy of CDP-choline in neuroprotection and abstinence.",M2
20040926,"Glial dysfunction in abstinent methamphetamine abusers.Persistent neurochemical abnormalities in frontal brain structures are believed to result from methamphetamine use. We developed a localized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) assay on a conventional MR scanner, to quantify selectively glial metabolic flux rate in frontal brain of normal subjects and a cohort of recovering abstinent methamphetamine abusers. Steady-state bicarbonate concentrations were similar, between 11 and 15 mmol/L in mixed gray-white matter of frontal brain of normal volunteers and recovering methamphetamine-abusing subjects (P&gt;0.1). However, glial (13)C-bicarbonate production rate from [1-(13)C]acetate, equating with glial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle rate, was significantly reduced in frontal brain of abstinent methamphetamine-addicted women (methamphetamine 0.04 micromol/g per min (N=5) versus controls 0.11 micromol/g per min (N=5), P=0.001). This is equivalent to 36% of the normal glial TCA cycle rate. Severe reduction in glial TCA cycle rate that normally comprises 10% of total cerebral metabolic rate may impact operation of the neuronal glial glutamate cycle and result in accumulation of frontal brain glutamate, as observed in these recovering methamphetamine abusers. Although these are the first studies to define directly an abnormality in glial metabolism in human methamphetamine abuse, sequential studies using analogous (13)C MRS methods may determine 'cause and effect' between glial failure and neuronal injury.",M2
20028943,"Cerebral metabolic alterations in rats with diabetic ketoacidosis: effects of treatment with insulin and intravenous fluids and effects of bumetanide.OBJECTIVE: Cerebral edema is a life-threatening complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children. Recent data suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion and activation of cerebral ion transporters may be involved, but data describing cerebral metabolic alterations during DKA are lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 50 juvenile rats with DKA and 21 normal control rats using proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>). MRS measured cerebral intracellular pH and ratios of metabolites including ATP/inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), and lactate/Cr before and during DKA treatment. We determined the effects of treatment with insulin and intravenous saline with or without bumetanide, an inhibitor of Na-K-2Cl cotransport, using ANCOVA with a 2 x 2 factorial study design. RESULTS: Cerebral intracellular pH was decreased during DKA compared with control (mean +/- SE difference -0.13 +/- 0.03; P &lt; 0.001), and lactate/Cr was elevated (0.09 +/- 0.02; P &lt; 0.001). DKA rats had lower ATP/Pi and NAA/Cr (-0.32 +/- 0.10, P = 0.003, and -0.14 +/- 0.04, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) compared with controls, but PCr/Pi was not significantly decreased. During 2-h treatment with insulin/saline, ATP/Pi, PCr/Pi, and NAA/Cr declined significantly despite an increase in intracellular pH. Bumetanide treatment increased ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi and ameliorated the declines in these values with insulin/saline treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that cerebral metabolism is significantly compromised during DKA and that further deterioration occurs during early DKA treatment--consistent with possible effects of cerebral hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury. Treatment with bumetanide may help diminish the adverse effects of initial treatment with insulin/saline.",M2
20028894,"Quantification of muscle choline concentrations by proton MR spectroscopy at 3 T: technical feasibility.OBJECTIVE: The quantification of choline in musculoskeletal tissues has several potential uses, including characterizing malignancy, but has not been previously achievable. We present a method of measuring the absolute concentration of choline by proton MR spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) in skeletal muscle at 3 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 3 T, choline measurements were performed in phantoms and healthy volunteers using proton MRS (point-resolved spectroscopy sequence [PRESS]; TR/TE, 2,000/135). In vitro choline concentrations were measured in three phantom solutions (10, 5, 1.25 mmol). Choline T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured in the muscles of five healthy subjects. In vivo choline concentrations were measured using water as an internal reference and average T1 and T2 relaxation times in 20 muscle locations (quadriceps, hamstring, adductor) of seven healthy subjects (four men, three women). Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: In vitro, the average measured choline concentrations of the 10-, 5-, and 1.25-mmol solutions were 9.91, 5.03, and 1.22 mmol, respectively. In vivo, the average T1 and T2 relaxation times of choline were 1,372+/-57 (SD) and 134+/-11 milliseconds, respectively. The average choline concentrations in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were 10.0+/-0.4 (SD) and 8.0+/-2.9 mmol/kg. Interindividual variation existed in the choline concentrations (quadriceps range, 6.7-13 mmol/kg), but there was little variation by patient sex. CONCLUSION: In the musculoskeletal system, the measurement of choline concentration by proton MRS at 3 T is feasible using water as an internal reference. These data provide a quantitative basis for future investigations of metabolite concentrations in normal and diseased musculoskeletal tissues.",M2
20027589,"Diurnal stability of gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in visual and sensorimotor cortex.PURPOSE: To establish the diurnal stability of edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in visual and sensorimotor regions of the brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GABA measurements were made in two regions of the brain (an occipital,  visual  region and a  sensorimotor  region centered on the precentral gyrus) using the MEGA-PRESS editing method, scanning eight healthy adults at five timepoints during a single day. GABA concentration was quantified from the ratio of the GABA integral to the unsuppressed water signal. RESULTS: No significant effect of time on GABA concentration was seen (P = 0.35). GABA was shown to be significantly more concentrated in visual regions than in sensorimotor regions (1.10 i.u. and 1.03 i.u., respectively; P = 0.050). Coefficients of variability (CVs) across all subjects of 9.1% and 12% (visual and sensorimotor) were significantly higher than mean within-subjects CVs of 6.5% and 8.8. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the excellent reproducibility of MEGA-PRESS detection of GABA, demonstrating that the method is sufficiently sensitive to detect inter-subject variability, and suggests that (within the sensitivity limits of current measurements) time of day can be ignored in the design of <e>MRS</e> studies of visual and sensorimotor regions.",M2
20022731,"GABA concentration in schizophrenia patients and the effects of antipsychotic medication: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. High magnetic field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) provides a reliable measurement of GABA in specific regions of the brain. This study measured GABA concentration in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and in the left basal ganglia (ltBG) in 38 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 29 healthy control subjects. There was no significant difference in GABA concentration between the schizophrenia patients and the healthy controls in either the ACC (1.36+/-0.45 mmol/l in schizophrenia patients and 1.52+/-0.54 mmol/l in control subjects) or the ltBG (1.13+/-0.26 mmol/l in schizophrenia patients and 1.18+/-0.20 mmol/l in control subjects). Among the right handed schizophrenia patients, the GABA concentration in the ltBG was significantly higher in patients taking typical antipsychotics (1.25+/-0.24 mmol/l) than in those taking atypical antipsychotics (1.03+/-0.24 mmol/l, p=0.026). In the ACC, the GABA concentration was negatively correlated with the dose of the antipsychotics (rs=-0.347, p=0.035). In the ltBG, the GABA concentration was positively correlated with the dose of the anticholinergics (rs=0.403, p=0.015). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have directly measured GABA concentrations in schizophrenia patients using (1)H-MRS. Our results suggest that there are no differences in GABA concentrations in the ACC or the ltBG of schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Antipsychotic medication may cause changes in GABA concentration, and atypical and typical antipsychotics may have differing effects. It is possible that medication effects conceal inherent differences in GABA concentrations between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.",M2
20022471,"<e>MRS</e>-lateralisation index in patients with epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia or a MEG-focus using bilateral single voxels.PURPOSE: To evaluate if single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SV-MRS) can help in lateralising and sometimes in localizing an epileptogenic focus. The assumption is that in MRI negative patients the underlying pathology most often is focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Several studies have shown that in the presence of FCD there are also (1)H-MRS abnormalities on the contralateral side. However, in most cases the studied group was not homogeneous and included different forms of dysplasias, including band heterotopias and polymicrogyria, and the studies used different spectroscopy protocols. In the present study, using bilateral SV-MRS we investigated the presence of a lateralisation index in two groups of patients with localisation related epilepsy: patients with focal cortical dysplasia on MRI and patients without MRI abnormalities with a focus identified by MEG. Aim of the study was to show that in both groups the expected epileptogenic side shows more pronounced metabolic alterations, making MRS a possible screening tool for clarifying lateralisation questions in patients with cryptogenic localisation related epilepsy. METHODS: In ten patients a single voxel was placed over the FCD and in nine patients over the region of interest (ROI) as indicated by MEG. In all patients a voxel was also placed in the contralateral homologus location. We used metabolite concentrations as peak ratios relative to the creatine (Cr) peak to calculate a lateralisation index. RESULTS: In both groups NAA/Cr was significantly lower on the affected side whereas the results for Cho/Cr were more diverse. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The limitations of the used methods and the implications of the findings are discussed.",M2
20008831,"Effect of apolipoprotein-B synthesis inhibition on liver triglyceride content in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.To investigate the impact of mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) synthesis inhibitor, on intra-hepatic triglyceride content (IHTG content), we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 21 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Subjects received a weekly subcutaneous dose of 200 mg mipomersen or placebo for 13 weeks while continuing conventional lipid lowering therapy. The primary endpoint was change in IHTG content from week 0 to week 15 as measured by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>). Thirteen weeks of mipomersen administration reduced LDL-cholesterol by 22.0 (17.8) % and apoB by 19.9 (17.4) % (both P &lt; 0.01). One of 10 patients (10%) in the mipomersen-treated group developed mild hepatic steatosis at week 15, which was reversible following mipomersen discontinuation. For the group, there was a trend toward an increase in IHTG content [placebo; baseline: 1.2% and week 15: 1.1%; change -0.1 (0.9). Mipomersen; baseline: 1.2% and week 15: 2.1%; change 0.8 (1.7) (P = 0.0513)]. Mipomersen administration for 13 weeks to subjects with FH is associated with a trend toward an increase in IHTG content. Future studies evaluating the effects of long-term use of mipomersen reaching more profound reductions in apoB are required prior to broader use of this compound.",M2
20008827,"Measuring intracellular pH in the heart using hyperpolarized carbon dioxide and bicarbonate: a 13C and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.AIMS: Technological limitations have restricted in vivo assessment of intracellular pH (pH(i)) in the myocardium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate, coupled with (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>), to measure pH(i) in the healthy and diseased heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate was infused into isolated rat hearts before and immediately after ischaemia, and the formation of (13)CO(2) and H(13)CO(3)(-) was monitored using (13)C MRS. The HCO(3)(-)/CO(2) ratio was used in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to estimate pH(i). We tested the validity of this approach by comparing (13)C-based pH(i) measurements with (31)P MRS measurements of pH(i). There was good agreement between the pH(i) measured using (13)C and (31)P MRS in control hearts, being 7.12 +/- 0.10 and 7.07 +/- 0.02, respectively. In reperfused hearts, (13)C and (31)P measurements of pH(i) also agreed, although (13)C equilibration limited observation of myocardial recovery from acidosis. In hearts pre-treated with the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor, 6-ethoxyzolamide, the (13)C measurement underestimated the (31)P-measured pH(i) by 0.80 pH units. Mathematical modelling predicted that the validity of measuring pH(i) from the H(13)CO(3)(-)/(13)CO(2) ratio depended on CA activity, and may give an incorrect measure of pH(i) under conditions in which CA was inhibited, such as in acidosis. Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate was also infused into healthy living rats, where in vivo pH(i) from the H(13)CO(3)(-)/(13)CO(2) ratio was measured to be 7.20 +/- 0.03. CONCLUSION: Metabolically generated (13)CO(2) and H(13)CO(3)(-) can be used as a marker of cardiac pH(i) in vivo, provided that CA activity is at normal levels.",M2
20006975,"Seizures are associated with brain injury severity in a neonatal model of hypoxia-ischemia.Hypoxia-ischemia is a significant cause of brain damage in the human newborn and can result in long-term neurodevelopmental disability. The loss of oxygen and glucose supply to the developing brain leads to excitotoxic neuronal cell damage and death; such over-excitation of nerve cells can also manifest as seizures. The newborn brain is highly susceptible to seizures although it is unclear what role they have in hypoxic-ischemic (H/I) injury. The aim of this study was to determine an association between seizures and severity of brain injury in a piglet model of perinatal H/I and, whether injury severity was related to type of seizure, i.e. sub-clinical (electrographic seizures only) or clinical (electrographic seizures+physical signs). Hypoxia (4% O(2)) was induced in anaesthetised newborn piglets for 30 min with a final 10 min period of hypotension; animals were recovered and survived to 72 h. Animals were monitored daily for seizures both visually and with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Brain injury was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (1)H-MR spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>), EEG and by histology (haematoxylin and eosin). EEG seizures were observed in 75% of all H/I animals, 46% displayed clinical seizures and 29% sub-clinical seizures. Seizure animals showed significantly lower background amplitude EEG across all post-insult days. Presence of seizures was associated with lower cortical apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scores and changes in (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios at both 24 and 72 h post-insult. On post-mortem examination animals with seizures showed the greatest degree of neuropathological injury compared to animals without seizures. Furthermore, clinical seizure animals had significantly greater histological injury compared with sub-clinical seizure animals; this difference was not apparent on MRI or (1)H-MRS measures. In conclusion we report that both sub-clinical and clinical seizures are associated with increased severity of H/I injury in a term model of neonatal H/I.",M2
20001674,"Neuronal and axonal degeneration in experimental spinal cord injury: in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histology.Longitudinal in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>) and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the tissue degeneration in traumatically injured rat spinal cord rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter. On 1H-MRS significant decreases in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and total creatine (Cr) levels in the rostral, epicenter, and caudal segments were observed by 14 days, and levels remained depressed up to 56 days post-injury (PI). In contrast, the total choline (Cho) levels increased significantly in all three segments by 14 days PI, but recovered in the epicenter and caudal, but not the rostral region, at 56 days PI. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuronal cell death in the gray matter, and reactive astrocytes and axonal degeneration in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral white-matter columns. These results suggest delayed tissue degeneration in regions both rostrally and caudally from the epicenter in the injured spinal cord tissue. A rostral-caudal asymmetry in tissue recovery was seen both on MRI-observed hyperintense lesion volume and the Cho, but not NAA and Cr, levels at 56 days PI. These studies suggest that dynamic metabolic changes take place in regions away from the epicenter in injured spinal cord.",M2
19994911,"Multivariate modeling and prediction of breast cancer prognostic factors using MR metabolomics.Axillary lymph node status together with estrogen and progesterone receptor status are important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In this study, the potential of using MR metabolomics for prediction of these prognostic factors was evaluated. Biopsies from breast cancer patients (n = 160) were excised during surgery and analyzed by high resolution magic angle spinning MR spectroscopy (HR MAS <e>MRS</e>). The spectral data were preprocessed and variable stability (VAST) scaled, and training and test sets were generated using the Kennard-Stone and SPXY sample selection algorithms. The data were analyzed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) and Bayesian belief networks (BBNs), and blind samples (n = 50) were predicted for verification. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status was successfully predicted from the MR spectra, and were best predicted by PLS-DA with a correct classification of 44 of 50 and 39 of 50 samples, respectively. Lymph node status was best predicted by BBN with 34 of 50 samples correctly classified, indicating a relationship between metabolic profile and lymph node status. Thus, MR profiles contain prognostic information that may be of benefit in treatment planning, and MR metabolomics may become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer patients.",M2
19994542,"Initial investigation on the use of MR spectroscopy and micro-MRI of GAFCHROMIC EBT radiotherapy film.PURPOSE: This article presents an initial investigation of the efficacy of using 1H <e>MRS</e> and micro-MRI as analysis techniques for irradiated GAFCHROMIC EBT radiotherapy films. METHODS: GAFCHROMIC EBT radiotherapy film was irradiated with 6 MV x rays to known doses ranging from 5 to 1000 cGy. 24 h following irradiation 1H MRS measurements were performed to access the degree of post-irradiation polymer cross-linking. 2D 1H micro-MRI experiments were also performed for film irradiations of 0 and 300 cGy. RESULTS: Linear response of the 1H MRS linewidth to dose in the range from 0 to 400 cGy (R2 = 0.98) was observed. Such linearity is not seen when analyzed under conventional light analysis. The sensitivity of the film, as measured by the slope of the curve between 0 and 400 cGy, is 0.0042 +/- 0.0003 kHz/cGy, demonstrating the sensitivity of the 1H MRS technique used to analyze the film. The film saturates at a dose of approximately 900 cGy. Broadline 1H MRS provides a quantitative measure of the degree of polymerization of the film. CONCLUSIONS: A quantitative measurement of the degree of polymerization of GAFCHROMIC EBT film has been presented using 1H MRS. The saturation of the film at approximately 900 cGy is corroborated by that observed with light analysis. Further MR spectroscopic experiments are needed to investigate the response of the film to dose, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship between polymer cross-linking in the active layer.",M2
19965287,"Advanced imaging techniques in brain tumors.Perfusion, permeability and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) are now widely used in the research and clinical settings. In the clinical setting, qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative approaches such as review of color-coded maps to region of interest analysis and analysis of signal intensity curves are being applied in practice. There are several pitfalls with all of these approaches. Some of these shortcomings are reviewed, such as the relative low sensitivity of metabolite ratios from MRS and the effect of leakage on the appearance of color-coded maps from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging and what correction and normalization methods can be applied. Combining and applying these different imaging techniques in a multi-parametric algorithmic fashion in the clinical setting can be shown to increase diagnostic specificity and confidence.",M2
19968328,"Characterization of urinary biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a Nigerian population.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary hepatic malignancy worldwide. Current serum diagnostic biomarkers, such as alpha-fetoprotein, are expensive and insensitive in early tumor diagnosis. Urinary biomarkers differentiating HCC from chronic liver disease would be practical and widely applicable. Using an 11.7T nuclear magnetic resonance system, urine was analyzed from three well-matched subject groups, collected at Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), Nigeria. Multivariate factor analyses were performed using principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). All patients were of Nigerian descent: 18 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with HCC, 10 HBsAg positive patients with cirrhosis, and 15 HBsAg negative healthy Nigerian controls. HCC patients were distinguished from healthy controls, and from the cirrhosis cohort, with sensitivity/specificity of 100%/93% and 89.5%/88.9%, respectively. Metabolites that most strongly contributed to the multivariate models were creatinine, carnitine, creatine and acetone. Urinary (1)H <e>MRS</e> with multivariate statistical analysis was able to differentiate patients with HCC from normal subjects and patients with cirrhosis. Creatinine, carnitine, creatine and acetone were identified as the most influential metabolites. These findings have identified candidate urinary HCC biomarkers which have potential to be developed as simple urinary screening tests for the clinic.",M2
19965111,"Brain imaging developments based on in vivo <e>MRS</e>.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) known for its non-invasive and nondestructive nature, has been applied in biomedical and clinical research to assess the biochemical and metabolic information in a living brain. However, the applicability and detection sensitivity of in vivo MRS are, in general, limited by low concentrations of most cerebral metabolites of interest. The newly advanced high/ultrahigh MRI/MRS technology has substantially overcome this limitation and provided new and exciting opportunities for potential applications of in vivo MRS in brain research at high field. One particular interesting application is to measure and image the cerebral metabolic rates, ultimately, for investigating the neuroenergetics associated with brain function. Recently, significant progress has been made for developing in vivo MRS imaging (MRSI) methods for noninvasively measuring and imaging the cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO(2)) and ATP (CMR(ATP)) noninvasively. These new methods have been successfully applied for investigating the neuroenergetics changes associated with brain activation.",M2
19960965,"Reversible focal splenium lesion--<e>MRS</e> study of a different etiology.A 36-year-old man with staphylococcal meningitis had similar symptoms and MRI characteristics as reversible splenium lesion syndrome described in the literature-hyperdensity on DWI and T2WI/FLAIR, hypodensity on ADC, iso-intensity on T1WI, and no contrast enhancement on midline splenium. The splenium lesion on MRI disappeared as the symptoms improved. The etiology of staphylococcal meningitis was different from other reported cases, and the MRS study showed relatively elevated lactate and myo-inositol of splenium as compared to other selective regions in the brain (both white matter and gray matter), which implies increased anaerobic glycolysis and hyperosmolar state on the splenium. The ratios of NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr were abnormal in all selected regions, indicating that the pathologic change involved the whole brain. More series MRS and other advanced exams to correlate intracranial environment (ex. cerebral blood flow, osmolality, inflammatory process, metabolites distribution, and neurotransmitter changes) are needed to confirm the mechanisms of different etiologies with reversible splenium lesion syndrome.",M2
19959364,"Relative value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance perfusion, and 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography for detection of recurrence or grade increase in gliomas.In a consecutive series of 26 previously operated patients diagnosed with cerebral glioma, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>), 2-((18)F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and perfusion MRI (MRP), were performed at follow-up to distinguish recurrence from radiation necrosis, and to identify tumour upgrading. Discrepancy between techniques was observed in 9 cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of each technique to detect the presence of high grade glioma was: MRI, PPV=50%; MRS, PPV=91.6%, NPV=100%; FDG-PET, PPV=75%, NPV=61.1%; MRP, PPV=100%, NPV=100%. In the selected group of nine cases studied to differentiate viable tumour from radiation necrosis, MRS and MRP reached a PPV and a NPV of 100%, whereas for FDG-PET, PPV and NPV were 66.6% and 60%, respectively. To distinguish between viable high-grade glioma and radiation necrosis, gadolinium-enhanced MRI gives a high false-positive rate, while MRS and MRP are superior to FDG-PET in discriminating tumour recurrence, grade increase and radiation necrosis.",M2
19812948,"Evaluation of the late effects of CNS prophylactic treatment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the late changes seen in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) of the brain in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) survivors to assess neurotoxicity following prophylactic treatment with cranial irradiation (CRT) and/or intrathecal (ITMTX) and systemic MTX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed on two groups of patients. The first group consisted of 30 children who received CRT and ITMTX, and the second group was comprised of 15 children treated only with ITMTX. All patients were ALL survivors treated between 1994 and 2002. Radiotherapy was performed using two opposite fields for a total dose of 18 Gy. The children were examined from 6 to 12 years after treatment. All children underwent a physical and neurological examination and MRI/MRS studies. (1)H-MR spectra were acquired from frontal and occipital regions of the brain. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated for following metabolite ratios: NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and mI/Cr. RESULTS: Three of the 45 children (11%) presented with white matter changes upon MRI examination. All children with MRI abnormalities received CRT. In 13 (31%) children, changes in (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios were seen. We observed decreased NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios. MR spectroscopy showed a significant reduction (P &lt; .05) of the mean NAA/Cr ratio in children given CRT. CONCLUSION: MRS is a sensitive detector of late metabolic changes after prophylactic treatment for ALL in childhood. It is able to detect metabolic effects of treatment in patients even when no morphologic changes are visible upon MRI.",M2
19812947,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic evaluation of brain tissue metabolism after irradiation for pediatric brain tumors in long-term survivors: a report of two cases.OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the metabolic profile of brain tissue of two long-term survivors of childhood brain tumors. MATERIALS: Two males who were 25 and 33 years old at the time of examination and had been irradiated for brain tumors at the age of 17 and 13 years respectively. The first subject had been operated on radically for medulloblastoma and received craniospinal axis irradiation composed of a whole brain radiotherapy with boost to the posterior fossa (total dose (TD) = 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions) and spinal canal irradiation (TD = 30 Gy in 20 fractions) according to the protocol at the time of treatment. The second subject had previously received whole brain irradiation (TD = 45 Gy in 19 fractions) because of inoperable central region tumor of unknown histology. METHODS: Short echo-time (TE = 30 ms) point-resolved spectra were obtained using a 2 T magnet. Ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), lactate (Lac) and lipids (Lip) signal intensities were calculated using the creatine (Cr) signal as an internal reference. The spectra were acquired both from the tumor bed area and uninvolved brain tissue in the first subject, and from uninvolved brain areas of frontal and occipital lobes in the second subject. RESULTS: In both cases, <e>MRS</e> examination revealed ratios of NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and mI/Cr within normal range in most spectra. Nevertheless, a slight elevation of Lac/Cr (2.47 and 1.05) and a more pronounced elevation of Lip/Cr proportions (45.77 and 3.97 respectively, in uninvolved sites) were detected in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic parameters correlated with neuronal function (NAA/Cr) and cell membrane metabolites turnover (Cho/Cr) seem to recover to normal values in long-term survivors of brain tumors. Lac/Cr and Lip/Cr proportions could be considered parameters indicating permanent radiation-induced brain damage; however, this proposal requires further investigation.",M2
19812945,"MR spectroscopic evaluation of brain tissue damage after treatment for pediatric brain tumors.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic profile of uninvolved brain tissue after treatment for pediatric brain tumors. MATERIAL: A group of 24 patients aged 4-18 years was analyzed after combined treatment for brain tumors. In this group, there were nine medulloblastomas, seven low-grade gliomas, three high-grade gliomas, two ependymomas and three children with conservatively treated diffuse brainstem gliomas. METHODS: Short echo-time (TE = 30 ms) point-resolved spectra were acquired using a 2 T clinical scanner (Elscint Prestige). The ratios of signal intensities for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), lactate (Lac), and lipids (Lip) were calculated using the creatine (Cr) signal as an internal reference. The spectra were acquired both from the tumor bed and from contralateral uninvolved brain tissue; only control spectra were analyzed. The first examination was made between the third and sixth month after therapy (24 spectra), the second examination occurred 8-12 months after treatment (15 spectra available), and the third was performed approximately 18 months after completion of therapy (eight spectra available). The results were compared using the t-test for dependent samples. RESULTS: At all time points, the metabolite ratios showed alterations indicating brain tissue damage. The most important were the decrease of NAA/Cr and increase of Lac/Cr and Lip/Cr ratios. The mean NAA/Cr values were 0.91, 0.91, and 0.86, respectively, for the three examinations, while the Lac/Cr and Lip/Cr values were 1.66, 2.11, 1.19 and 12.24, 12.05, 5.69, respectively. Interestingly, in children with supratentorial tumors, a significant increase in NAA/Cr value was observed (from 0.82 to 1.11 in the first and second examinations, respectively; p = 0.0487), which may be indicative of neuronal function recovery. CONCLUSIONS: <e>MRS</e> examinations of uninvolved brain tissue indicate long-lasting metabolic disturbances. However, the NAA/Cr ratio increase may be a sign of at least partial recovery of metabolic function of the brain.",M2
19812944,"Metabolic changes in rat brain following intracerebroventricular injections of streptozotocin: a model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.A decrease in cerebral glucose metabolic uptake is an early and characteristic sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Streptozotocin (STZ) is a bacterial toxin which damages insulin-producing cells and insulin receptors. Intracerebroventricular (icv) application of STZ in rats has been found to chronically decrease cerebral glucose uptake and produce other effects that bear a resemblance to several other molecular and pathological features of AD. In the present experiments in vivo (1)H MR Spectroscopy with short echo time (3 ms) was used to non-invasively obtain a neurochemical profile of rat brains, 3 weeks and 2 months after double icv injections of STZ or vehicle. Seventeen metabolites were quantified from 27 microL tissue volume which included hippocampus and a part of cerebral cortex, using the LCModel and unsuppressed water signal as an internal reference. Three weeks after icv STZ several metabolites were significantly decreased, the most prominent changes noted in glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine (-38 +/- 5%), glutathione (-37 +/- 4%), taurine (-30 +/- 19%), glutamate (-26 +/- 14%), phosphocreatine (-23 +/- 15%) and N-acetylaspartate (-16 +/- 6%). On the contrary, the concentration of N-acetylaspartylglutamate was found significantly increased (+38 +/- 18%). After 2 months some of these changes were even more pronounced. We conclude that in vivo (1)H <e>MRS</e> of rat brain following icv STZ injections provides a new input into a better understanding of the critical dependency of neural function and structure on brain glucose consumption, and may be of relevance in further studies of AD pathomechanism.",M2
19812943,"Pattern recognition methods in (1)H <e>MRS</e> monitoring in vivo of normal appearing cerebellar tissue after treatment of posterior fossa tumors.The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic responses of normal appearing cerebellar tissue after posterior fossa tumor treatment, and to identify characteristics of the particular treatment method. Moreover, this work examined the metabolic alterations of normal appearing tissue induced by a particular tumor state including resection, stagnation, progression, and recurrence. The studied group consisted of 29 patients treated for posterior fossa tumors. All of them were irradiated with a total dose of 54 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction (median values). In addition, 13 underwent chemotherapy, 25 underwent total tumor resection, 18 were tumor-free in control examinations, 5 had a stable disease, and tumor progression or recurrence was observed in 2 and 4 cases, respectively. The 69 spectra, acquired using a MRI/MRS 2T system, were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) with orthogonal signal correction (OSC) spectral filtering. A significantly elevated spectral region (0.97-1.55 ppm) was observed in patients after total resection in comparison to non-operated subjects. Patients treated with chemotherapy showed an elevated band between 1.15-1.75 and 2.7-3.0 ppm and had decreases in the remaining parts of the spectra. Increases in lactate and decreases in the remaining metabolites were characteristic for the tumor progression/recurrence group. Pattern recognition methods coupled with MRS revealed significant treatment-dependent alterations in normal appearing cerebellar tissue, as well as metabolic changes induced by tumor progression/recurrence.",M2
19955111,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by the PLP1 'rumpshaker mutation'.BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. Mutations in PLP1 on the X chromosome cause spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) or the allelic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD). The PLP1 protein is a major myelin protein involved in stabilisation and maintenance of the myelin sheath. The function of the protein has been studied in the rumpshaker mouse, which is a model of SPG2/PMD. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the phenotype of patients with the 'rumpshaker mutation.' PATIENTS: A family with HSP caused by the 'rumpshaker mutation.' RESULTS: The patients showed nystagmus during infancy and had early onset of HSP. They had normal cognition, and cerebral MRI showed relatively unspecific white matter abnormalities on T2 sequences without clear progression. Urinary urgency was reported among the female carriers. <e>MRS</e> of both patients showed increased myo-inositol in the white matter, while decreased N-acetylaspartate was found exclusively in the oldest patient. All evoked potential examinations were compatible with severe central demyelination, while no signs of peripheral demyelination or axonal degeneration were found. (18)F-FDG-PET scans were normal. CONCLUSION: The phenotypes of the patients reported here are the mildest described to be caused by the rumpshaker mutation and represent the mildest form among the spectrum of PLP1 related disorders. No definite symptoms in the female carriers could be ascribed to the mutation. These data suggest the pathology to be an underlying dysmyelinating disorder in combination with a central axonal degeneration.",M2
19955008,"Response to creatine analogs in fibroblasts and patients with creatine transporter deficiency.Creatine transporter (CRTR) deficiency is one of the most frequent causes of X-linked mental retardation. The lack of an effective treatment for this disease, in contrast to creatine (Cr) biosynthesis disorders that respond to Cr monohydrate (CM), led us to analyze the efficacy of a lipophilic molecule derived from Cr, creatine ethyl ester (CEE), in fibroblasts and patients with CRTR deficiency. CM and CEE uptake studies were performed in six controls and four fibroblast cell lines from patients. We found a significant increase in Cr uptake after 72 h of incubation with CEE (500 micromol/L) in patients and control fibroblasts compared to incubation with CM. Subsequently, we assayed the clinical effect of CEE administration in four patients with CRTR deficiency. After 1 year of treatment, a lack of significant improvement in neuropsychological assessment or changes in Cr level in brain (1)H <e>MRS</e> was observed, and CEE was discontinued. In conclusion, this 12-month trial with CEE did not increase the brain concentration of Cr. Our in vitro data lend support to the idea of a certain passive transport of CEE in both pathological and control cells, although more lipophilic molecules or other cell systems that mimic the BBB should be used for a better approach to the in vivo system.",M2

19946939,"Associations between plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and negative symptoms or cognitive impairments in early-stage schizophrenia.Schizophrenic patients demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, including attention, executive functions, and working memory, even in the early stage of disease. In the present study, we examined the association between blood levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in patients with early-stage schizophrenia. We also investigated the association between frontal GABA levels using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) at 3T and scores on the WCST in the same patients. Blood levels of BDNF and catecholamine metabolites and brain GABA levels using 1H-MRS were measured in 18 schizophrenic patients (nine males, nine females; age range 13-52 year). A significantly positive correlation was observed between plasma MHPG levels and %PEM (rho = -0.686, p = 0.0047). A trend toward negative correlation was found between frontal lobe GABA levels and the per cent of preservation error (%PEM) in the early stage of schizophrenia (rho = -0.420, p = 0.0836). These results suggest that noradrenergic neurons might be involved in neuropsychological functions in early-stage of schizophrenia.",M2
19937238,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in pediatric neuroradiology: clinical and research applications.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) offers a unique, noninvasive approach to assess pediatric neurological abnormalities at microscopic levels by quantifying cellular metabolites. The most widely available MRS method, proton ((1)H; hydrogen) spectroscopy, is FDA approved for general use and can be ordered by clinicians for pediatric neuroimaging studies if indicated. There are a multitude of both acquisition and post-processing methods that can be used in the implementation of MR spectroscopy. MRS in pediatric neuroimaging is challenging to interpret because of dramatic normal developmental changes that occur in metabolites, particularly in the first year of life. Still, MRS has been proven to provide additional clinically relevant information for several pediatric neurological disease processes such as brain tumors, infectious processes, white matter disorders, and neonatal injury. MRS can also be used as a powerful quantitative research tool. In this article, specific research applications using MRS will be demonstrated in relation to neonatal brain injury and pediatric brain tumor imaging.",M2
19935799,"A phase I study of the nitroimidazole hypoxia marker SR4554 using 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy.BACKGROUND: SR4554 is a fluorine-containing 2-nitroimidazole, designed as a hypoxia marker detectable with 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>). In an initial phase I study of SR4554, nausea/vomiting was found to be dose-limiting, and 1400 mg m(-2) was established as MTD. Preliminary MRS studies demonstrated some evidence of 19F retention in tumour. In this study we investigated higher doses of SR4554 and intratumoral localisation of the 19F MRS signal. METHODS: Patients had tumours &gt; or = 3 cm in diameter and &lt; or = 4 cm deep. Measurements were performed using 1H/19F surface coils and localised 19F MRS acquisition. SR4554 was administered at 1400 mg m(-2), with subsequent increase to 2600 mg m(-2) using prophylactic metoclopramide. Spectra were obtained immediately post infusion (MRS no. 1), at 16 h (MRS no. 2) and 20 h (MRS no. 3), based on the SR4554 half-life of 3.5 h determined from a previous study. 19Fluorine retention index (%) was defined as (MRS no. 2/MRS no. 1)*100. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients enrolled at: 1400 (n=16), 1800 (n=1), 2200 (n=1) and 2600 mg m(-2) (n=8). SR4554 was well tolerated and toxicities were all &lt; or = grade 1; mean plasma elimination half-life was 3.7+/-0.9 h. SR4554 signal was seen on both unlocalised and localised MRS no. 1 in all patients. Localised 19F signals were detected at MRS no. 2 in 5 out of 9 patients and 4 out of 5 patients at MRS no. 3. The mean retention index in tumour was 13.6 (range 0.6-43.7) compared with 4.1 (range 0.6-7.3) for plasma samples taken at the same times (P=0.001) suggesting (19)F retention in tumour and, therefore, the presence of hypoxia. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the feasibility of using 19F MRS with SR4554 as a potential method of detecting hypoxia. Certain patients showed evidence of 19F retention in tumour, supporting further development of this technique for detection of tumour hypoxia.",M2

19931853,"Metabolic alterations in the amygdala in borderline personality disorder: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.BACKGROUND: Emotional dysfunction in a frontolimbic network has been implicated in the pathophysiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The amygdala is a key region of the limbic system and plays an important role in impulsivity, affect regulation, and emotional information processing and thus is likely related to BPD symptoms. Alterations of the metabolism in the amygdala might be of interest for understanding the pathophysiology of BPD. However, the amygdala is a difficult region from which to acquire magnetic resonance spectra. We implemented a method for proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H <e>MRS</e>) at 3.0 T in which we acquire data within only the small amygdala. The purpose of this study was to determine alterations of the metabolism in the amygdala in BPD patients. METHODS: Twenty-one unmedicated BPD patients and 20 age-matched healthy control participants underwent (1)H MRS to determine neurometabolite concentrations in the left amygdala. All participants underwent psychometric assessments. RESULTS: Significantly reduced total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) and total creatine (tCr) concentrations in the left amygdala of patients with BPD were found. BPD patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed lower levels of tCr compared with BPD patients without PTSD and healthy control subjects. No significant correlations between neurochemical concentrations and psychometric measures were found. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased tNAA and tCr might indicate disturbed affect regulation and emotional information processing in the amygdala of BPD patients. These findings are consistent with many functional and structural neuroimaging studies and may help to explain the greater emotional reactivity of BPD patients.",M2
19930568,"Prolonged rote learning produces delayed memory facilitation and metabolic changes in the hippocampus of the ageing human brain.BACKGROUND: Repeated rehearsal is one method by which verbal material may be transferred from short- to long-term memory. We hypothesised that extended engagement of memory structures through prolonged rehearsal would result in enhanced efficacy of recall and also of brain structures implicated in new learning. Twenty-four normal participants aged 55-70 (mean = 60.1) engaged in six weeks of rote learning, during which they learned 500 words per week every week (prose, poetry etc.). An extensive battery of memory tests was administered on three occasions, each six weeks apart. In addition, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>) was used to measure metabolite levels in seven voxels of interest (VOIs) (including hippocampus) before and after learning. RESULTS: Results indicate a facilitation of new learning that was evident six weeks after rote learning ceased. This facilitation occurred for verbal/episodic material only, and was mirrored by a metabolic change in left posterior hippocampus, specifically an increase in NAA/(Cr+Cho) ratio. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that repeated activation of memory structures facilitates anamnesis and may promote neuronal plasticity in the ageing brain, and that compliance is a key factor in such facilitation as the effect was confined to those who engaged fully with the training.",M2
19925210,"Metabolic levels in the corpus callosum and their structural and behavioral correlates after moderate to severe pediatric TBI.Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to long-term functional morbidity. The corpus callosum (CC) is particularly vulnerable to this type of injury. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) was used to characterize the metabolic status of two CC regions of interest (ROIs) (anterior and posterior), and their structural (diffusion tensor imaging; DTI) and neurobehavioral (neurocognitive functioning, bimanual coordination, and interhemispheric transfer time [IHTT]) correlates. Two groups of moderate/severe TBI patients (ages 12-18 years) were studied: post-acute (5 months post-injury; n = 10), and chronic (14.7 months post-injury; n = 8), in addition to 10 age-matched healthy controls. Creatine (energy metabolism) did not differ between groups across both ROIs and time points. In the TBI group, choline (membrane degeneration/inflammation) was elevated for both ROIs at the post-acute but not chronic period. N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) (neuronal/axonal integrity) was reduced initially for both ROIs, with partial normalization at the chronic time point. Posterior, not anterior, NAA was positively correlated with DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) (r = 0.88), and most domains of neurocognition (r range 0.22-0.65), and negatively correlated with IHTT (r = -0.89). Inverse corerlations were noted between creatine and posterior FA (r = -0.76), neurocognition (r range -0.22 to -0.71), and IHTT (r = 0.76). Multimodal studies at distinct time points in specific brain structures are necessary to delineate the course of the degenerative and reparative processes following TBI, which allows for preliminary hypotheses about the nature and course of the neural mechanisms of subsequent functional morbidity. This will help guide the future development of targeted therapeutic agents.",M2
19921970,"Cortical neurochemistry in euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder.OBJECTIVE: Prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions are assumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of mood regulation. Reduced prefrontal and anterior cingulate function indicated by decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in patients with bipolar disorder has been reported inconsistently. A positive correlation between lithium serum level and NAA concentrations has been found previously. The aim of this study was to re-investigate prefrontal and anterior cingulate neurochemistry in a sample of euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder. METHODS: NAA, choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and myo-inositol (Ins) in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left anterior cingulate cortex were measured in 33 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder and 29 healthy comparison subjects by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([(1)H]<e>MRS</e>). RESULTS: Metabolic ratios did not differ between patients with bipolar I disorder and comparison subjects in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex neither in the total sample nor in the pairwise matched sub-sample. We could not observe an association between lithium level and NAA ratios. Lithium treated patients demonstrated unchanged NAA or myo-inositol ratios compared to alternatively treated patients. CONCLUSION: In contrast to prior findings, we could not observe any metabolic alterations in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder.",M2

19906515,"Lower glutamate levels in rostral anterior cingulate of chronic cocaine users - A (1)H-<e>MRS</e> study using TE-averaged PRESS at 3 T with an optimized quantification strategy.Previous studies have shown significantly lower metabolism and functional activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of human cocaine addicts. The present study examined whether this ACC hypoactivity is associated with altered glutamate (Glu), the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), which has been recently implicated in drug addiction. Participants comprised 14 chronic cocaine addicts and 14 matched healthy volunteers who were examined using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T. A new quantification strategy for echo time (TE)-averaged point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) was applied to disentangle relaxation effects from J-evolution of coupled spin systems such as Glu. The concentrations of Glu as well as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), choline-containing compounds (tCho), and myo-inositol (Ins) were estimated from both groups. Glu/tCr was significantly lower in chronic cocaine users compared to control subjects and was significantly correlated with years of cocaine use. Glu/tCr was also positively correlated with NAA/tCr. NAA/tCr significantly decreased with age but was not significantly different between the two groups. These findings suggest a metabolic/neurotransmitter dysregulation associated with cocaine addiction and support a possible therapeutic intervention strategy aimed at normalizing the Glu transmission and function in the treatment of cocaine addiction.",M2
19906112,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: quantitative assessment of liver fat content by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical application of imaging technology in the quantitative assessment of fatty liver with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Overall 36 patients with diffuse fatty liver who had undertaken the computed tomography (CT) scan, MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (1H <e>MRS</e>) were analyzed. Their body mass index (BMI) was measured and their liver to spleen CT ratio (L/S) calculated on the plain CT scan. MR T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) was obtained with in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP) images. T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was acquired with or without the fat-suppression technique. The liver fat content (LFC) was quantified as the percentage of relative signal intensity loss on T1WI or T2WI images. The intrahepatic content of lipid (IHCL) was expressed as the percentage of peak value ratio of lipid to water by 1H MRS. RESULTS: The results of BMI measurement, CT L/S ratio, LFC calculated from MR T1WI and T2WI images, as well as IHCL measured by 1H MRS were 27.26 +/- 3.01 kg/m2, 0.88 +/- 0.26, 13.80 +/- 9.92%, 40.67 +/- 16.04% and 30.98 +/- 20.43%, respectively. The LFC calculated from MR T1WI, T2WI images and IHCL measured by 1H MRS correlated significantly with the CT L/S ratio (r = -0.830, P = 0.000; r = -0.736, P = 0.000; r = -0.461, P = 0.005, respectively). BMI correlated significantly only with the liver fat contents measured by T1WI IP/OP and 1H MRS (r = -0.347, P = 0.038; r = -0.374, P = 0.025, respectively). CONCLUSION: CT, MR imaging and 1H MRS were effective methods for the quantitative assessment of LFC. The MR imaging, especially 1H MRS, would be used more frequently in the clinical evaluation of fatty liver and (1)H MRS could more accurately reflect the severity of fatty liver.",M2
19901714,"Serial MR spectroscopy in relapsing reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.BACKGROUND: Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) in atypical locations is difficult to diagnose. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) can help, but results to date are discrepant. We aimed to describe MRS findings in each phase of RPLS and evaluate their diagnostic potential. METHODS: We performed MRS, diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional MR during 2 episodes in a patient with hypertensive encephalopathy. RESULTS: There were multifocal edematous lesions in both frontal lobes, the left temporo-occipital region and both cerebellar hemispheres in the first episode, and in both cerebellar hemispheres and the left pons in the second. Apparent diffusion coefficient values were high. Choline was normal in the acute phase and elevated in the subacute period. N-acetylaspartate was low throughout, even after clinical recovery and disappearance of the lesion on conventional MR. No lactate peak was detected. CONCLUSIONS: MRS helps differentiate RPLS from several encephalopathies and a N-acetylaspartate decrease does not predict a poor outcome.",M2
19901248,"Hippocampal correlates of pain in healthy elderly adults: a pilot study.BACKGROUND: Few neuroimaging investigations of pain in elderly adults have focused on the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in nociceptive processing that is also subject to involution associated with dementing disorders. The goal of this pilot study was to examine MRI- and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>)-derived hippocampal correlates of pain in older adults. METHODS: A subset of 20 nondemented older adults was drawn from the Einstein Aging Study, a community-based sample from the Bronx, NY. Pain was measured on 3 time scales: 1) acute pain right now (pain severity); 2) pain over the past 4 weeks (Short Form-36 Bodily Pain); 3) chronic pain over the past 3 months (Total Pain Index). Hippocampal data included volume data normalized to midsagittal area and N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratios (NAA/Cr). RESULTS: Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with higher ratings on the Short Form-36 Bodily Pain (r(s) = 0.52, p = 0.02) and a nonsignificant trend was noted for higher ratings of acute pain severity (r(s) = -0.44, p = 0.06). Lower levels of hippocampal NAA/Cr were associated with higher acute pain severity (r(s) = -0.45, p = 0.05). Individuals with chronic pain had a nonsignificant trend for smaller hippocampal volumes (t = 2.00, p = 0.06) and lower levels of hippocampal NAA/Cr (t = 1.71, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who report more severe acute or chronic pain have smaller hippocampal volumes and lower levels of hippocampal N-acetylaspartate/creatine, a marker of neuronal integrity. Future studies should consider the role of the hippocampus and other brain structures in the development and experience of pain in healthy elderly and individuals with Alzheimer disease.",M2
19889129,"Galantamine-ER for cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder and correlation with hippocampal neuronal viability: a proof-of-concept study.BACKGROUND: Many subjects with bipolar disorder experience significant cognitive dysfunction, even when euthymic, but few studies assess biological correlates of or treatment strategies for cognitive dysfunction. METHOD: Nineteen subjects with bipolar disorder in remission, who reported subjective cognitive deficits, were treated with open-label galantamine-ER 8-24 mg/day for 4 months. Ten healthy volunteers matched for age and gender were also assessed. Mood and subjective cognitive questionnaires were administered monthly. At the beginning and the end of the trial all subjects were administered neuropsychological tests, including tests of attention (Conners CPT) and episodic memory (CVLT). Bipolar subjects underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>) measurements before and after treatment, healthy volunteers completed baseline 1H-MRS. We acquired 1H-MRS data at 4.0 T from voxels centered on the left and right hippocampus to measure hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, a measure of neuronal viability) and choline containing compounds (Cho, a marker of lipid metabolism and membrane turn-over). RESULTS: Compared to healthy volunteers, bipolar subjects had higher baseline subjective cognitive deficits and lower scores on objective tests of attention (Conner's CPT) and verbal episodic memory (CVLT). After treatment, bipolar subjects experienced significant improvement of subjective cognitive scores and on objective tests of attention (Conner's CPT) and verbal episodic memory (CVLT). In the left hippocampus NAA increased and choline (Cho) decreased in bipolar subjects during treatment. CONCLUSION: Bipolar subjects had cognitive dysfunction; treatment with Galantamine-ER was associated with improved cognition and with increases in neuronal viability and normalization of lipid membrane metabolism in the left hippocampus. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00181636).",M2
19885604,"Identification of mobile lipids in human cancer tissues by ex vivo diffusion edited HR-MAS <e>MRS</e>.Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy visible mobile lipids are considered important markers in the diagnosis of human cancer and are thought to be closely involved in various aspects of tumour transformation, such as cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, hypoxia and drug resistance. A method allowing the straightforward identification of the lipid classes contributing to the mobile lipids in human malignant tissues is highly advisable. Ex vivo High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was done directly on human cerebral, renal and colorectal malignant tissue specimens. A diffusion edited sequence, based on stimulated echo and bipolar gradient pulses, was used to characterize molecules with low diffusion rates, arising from mobile lipid components. Cholesterol, triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine are simultaneously detected and all contribute to the mobile lipid resonances present in malignant glioma and clear cell renal carcinoma tissue specimens spectra. On the contrary, papillary cell renal carcinoma spectrum is predominated by phosphatidylcholine resonances and that of colorectal adenocarcinoma is characterized by signals arising from triglycerides. Ex vivo diffusion edited High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, done on intact tissue, is a powerful analytical tool to obtain a simple and immediate identification of mobile lipid components. This can offer a significant contribution to better understanding their involvement in cancer tissues. Furthermore, ex vivo high resolution spectroscopic measurements allow to improve the interpretation of in vivo Magnetic Resonance spectra, increasing its clinical potentiality.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: (1)H-MRS was performed on a 1.5 Tesla (T) whole-body unit. Muscular lipids inside SOL and GM were assessed in both calves of the patient by a STEAM (stimulated echo acquisition mode) localization sequence. Results were compared to a control group of four healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Total amount of muscular lipids in the hypertrophic GM of the patient was clearly increased compared to the controls (38.7 versus 21.8+/-3.5 a.u.) while intramyocellular lipids of the adjacent SOL were lower compared to the contralateral healthy leg. CONCLUSION: Muscular lipids are substrates for metabolism and can be assessed non-invasively by (1)H-MRS. (1)H-MRS is considered to be a helpful tool in clinical assessment of muscle metabolism in cases with muscular hypo- or hypertrophy.",M2
19857754,"Discriminate liver warm ischemic injury during hypothermic machine perfusion by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a study in a porcine model.OBJECTIVE: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H <e>MRS</e>) is a technique to identify and quantify the composition of biofluids. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is an organ preservation method that has the potential to evaluate organ viability prior to transplantation by analyzing the composition of the perfusate. The aim of this study was to use (1)H MRS to examine the perfusate during HMP of porcine livers exposed to warm ischemia (WI) and to identify potential biomarkers of liver viability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porcine livers underwent 4 hours of HMP using kidney perfusion solution-1 (KPS-1) as perfusate after exposure to in situ WI of 0 (n = 6) or 2 hours (n = 5). Samples of the perfusate were taken at the start/end of HMP. Lactate and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the samples were measured biochemically as surrogates of the WI-induced damage. MRS acquisition was conducted on a 9.4 Tesla (400 MHz) high-resolution system. RESULTS: AST increased significantly during 4 hours of HMP within groups (P &lt; .02) and discriminated WI injury significantly from the start to the end of HMP (P &lt; .03). (1)H MRS showed significantly elevated signal intensity of lactate, alanine, and histidine during HMP within both groups (P &lt; .02). Furthermore, alanine and histidine were significantly higher in the WI group than in the control group at the end of HMP (P = .011 and P = .038, respectively). CONCLUSION: AST, alanine, and histidine in HMP perfusate discriminated WI injury on porcine liver grafts and might be potential biomarkers of liver viability.",M2
19856435,"Magnetic resonance T2-relaxometry and 2D L-correlated spectroscopy in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy.PURPOSE: To evaluate T(2)-relaxation changes in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) using T(2) relaxometry and to correlate T(2) values with brain metabolites evaluated using 2D magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight MHE patients and 13 healthy subjects were evaluated using T(2) relaxometry, and eight patients and nine healthy subjects underwent 2D MRS in right frontal and left occipital regions. Whole-brain T(2)-relaxation maps were compared between MHE and control subjects using analysis-of-covariance, with age and gender included as covariates. T(2) values derived from the right frontal and left occipital lobes were correlated with the metabolite ratios. RESULTS: Multiple brain regions including anterior and mid cingulate cortices, right anterior and left posterior insular cortices, right prefrontal, medial frontal, and right superior temporal cortices showed significantly increased T(2) values in MHE patients compared to control subjects. MRS showed significantly increased ratios of glutamine/glutamate (Glx) and decreased ratios of myo-inositol, taurine, choline, and myo-inositol/choline (mICh) with respect to creatine (Cr_d) in patients compared to controls. Frontal Glx/Cr_d showed significantly positive correlation with T(2) values. CONCLUSION: MHE patients showed significantly increased T(2) values in multiple brain regions reflecting increased free water content and T(2) values in frontal lobe correlated with the increased Glx/Cr_d ratio.",M2
19854108,"Correlation between memory, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and interictal epileptiform discharges in temporal lobe epilepsy related to mesial temporal sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study described here was to examine the relationship between memory function, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-<e>MRS</e>) abnormalities, and interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) lateralization in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) related to unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. METHODS: We assessed performance on tests of memory function and intelligence quotient (IQ) in 29 right-handed outpatients and 24 controls. IEDs were assessed on 30-minute-awake and 30-minute-sleep EEG samples. Patients had (1)H-MRS at 1.5 T. RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between IQ (P=0.031) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test results (P=0.022) and epilepsy duration; between(1)H-MRS findings and epilepsy duration (P=0.027); and between N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels and IEDs (P=0.006) in contralateral mesial temporal structures in the left MTS group. (1)H-MRS findings, IEDs, and verbal function were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IEDs and NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratios reflecting neural metabolism are closely related to verbal memory function in mesial temporal sclerosis. Higher interictal activity on the EEG was associated with a decline in total NAA in contralateral mesial temporal structures.",M2
19853639,"Effect of propofol on the levels of neurotransmitters in normal human brain: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.Though widely used in anesthesia for many years, the mechanism underlying propofol anesthesia on human is not clear. Animal studies have already demonstrated that propofol functioned mainly by affecting neurotransmitters release. In our study, 10 healthy volunteers ranging from 20 to 40 years old were enrolled. With the help of target-controlled infusion pump, propofol was delivered intravenously. The target-controlled concentration (TCC) of propofol was gradually elevated from 0.5 to 3.0 microg/ml (for 6 steps with an increment of 0.5 microg/ml). During each step the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S) was performed to evaluate asleep to awake/alert status. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) was performed to evaluate neurotransmitters (choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), glutamate (GLU), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)) changes in brains following propofol anesthesia. OAA/S scoring showed that when the TCCs of propofol were 0, 1.5 and 3.0 microg/ml, the volunteers were in awake, sedative and unconscious, respectively. Significantly down-regulated Cho and GLU, but up-regulated GABA was observed in unconscious state in all the detected regions. NAA was decreased in unconscious status only in the hippocampus and thalamus. There was no obvious change in Cr levels in any statuses or brain regions. Our results indicate that propofol has an impact on the levels of neurotransmitters such as NAA, GLU, GABA and Cho in normal human brain. During propofol anesthesia, enhancement of inhibition or suppression of excitation may each play key roles in different brain regions.",M2
19851163,"Changes in hippocampal metabolites after effective treatment for fibromyalgia: a case study.BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia has been associated with disrupted hippocampal brain metabolite ratios by studies using single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-<e>MRS</e>). Exposure to stress is considered a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of fibromyalgia symptoms. Basic science has demonstrated the hippocampus to be exquisitely sensitive to the effects of stressful experience, which results in changes including alterations in metabolite content and frank atrophy. METHODS: This report details the case of a 47-year-old woman with fibromyalgia who was originally found to have a profound depression of the ratio of N-acetylaspartate to creatine in her right hippocampus during participation in a study to assess brain metabolite disturbances in fibromyalgia utilizing single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An individualized treatment strategy was developed based both on physiological abnormalities associated with the disorder and symptoms that characterized the patient's unique clinical profile. RESULTS: Clinical and spectroscopic evaluation following nine months of treatment demonstrated both an improvement in her clinical profile and normalization of the NAA/Cr ratio within her right hippocampus. DISCUSSION: Therapeutic strategies aimed at demonstrable lesions associated with fibromyalgia appear to represent rational targets for pharmacological intervention. The rationale for development of novel pharmacotherapies for this unusual disorder is discussed.",M2
19850131,"Specific metabolites in the medial prefrontal cortex are associated with the neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia: a preliminary study.We measured brain metabolites in the medial prefrontal cortex of 19 schizophrenic patients and 18 healthy controls by 3 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H <e>MRS</e>), and examined the relationship between prefrontal cortex-related neurocognitive functions and brain metabolites in the medial prefrontal cortex. The patients with schizophrenia exhibited deficits on the verbal fluency, Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), trail making test, Stroop test and digit span distraction test (DSDT), but not on the Iowa gambling test. The patients showed statistical significant changes in the ratio of glutamine/glutamate, the ratio of N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA)/glycerophosphorylcholine plus phosphorylcholine (GPC+PC) and the levels of taurine in the medial prefrontal cortex compared with normal controls. Furthermore, we found significant correlations of the ratio of glutamine/glutamate with WCST and DSDT scores, the ratio of NAA/(GPC+PC) with verbal fluency and WCST scores, and the levels of taurine with scores on the Stroop test and Trail making test A among the participants. The ratios of NAA/(GPC+PC) and (GPC+PC)/(Cr+PCr) had significant relationships with the duration of untreated psychosis of the schizophrenic patients. The glutamine/glutamate ratio and levels of taurine were significantly related to the duration of illness of the patients. These data suggest that specific metabolites of the medial prefrontal cortex are associated with the neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",M2
19847418,"1H-<e>MRS</e> for the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: insight into the acute-disease stage.BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Differentiating ADEM from other inflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, is not always conclusive using conventional MRI. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) changes that distinguish ADEM from other inflammatory disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI/MRS scans were performed in seven patients with ADEM during the acute and chronic phases of the disease. RESULTS: Partial recovery was detected between the acute and chronic phases in choline/creatine ratio. Major elevation of lipids and reduction in myo-inositol/creatine ratio was detected in all patients during the acute phase, followed by a reduction in lipids peak and elevation above normal in myo-inositol/creatine ratio during the chronic phase. CONCLUSION: Consistent and unique MRS changes in metabolite ratios between the acute and chronic presentations of the disease were found. To the best of our knowledge, these patterns have not been described in other inflammatory disorders and might assist in the early diagnosis of ADEM.",M2
19845737,"Proton <e>MRS</e> may predict AED response in patients with TLE.PURPOSE: To compare relative N-acetylaspartate (NAA) measurements in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with good response to the first trial of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (an important prognostic factor) to TLE patients who failed the first AED monotherapy and required further AED trials with monotherapy or polytherapy. METHODS: We studied 25 consecutive TLE patients who responded to first AED (responders) and 21 who did not (failure-group), as well as 27 controls. Patients were seen regularly in our Epilepsy Service and underwent electroencephalography (EEG) investigation, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy. Voxels were tailored to the medial temporal region on each side and involved the anterior hippocampus. RESULTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated significant variation of NAA/creatine (NAA/Cr) values in both hippocampi, ipsilateral and contralateral to the EEG focus (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.021) across the groups. Pairwise post hoc comparisons showed reduced NAA/Cr in both hippocampi of failure-group compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001) and compared to responders (p &lt; 0.05), but not between the controls and responders. Individual analyses showed NAA/Cr ratios lower than 2 SDs (standard deviations) below the mean of controls in 9 of 21 patients (42.8%) in the failure-group (6 with unilateral and 3 with bilateral reduction) but in none of the responders. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that patients with TLE who respond well to the first AED have significantly less evidence of neuronal and axonal damage/dysfunction compared to those who are refractory to the first AED trial.",M2
19844191,"Noninvasive in vivo small animal MRI and <e>MRS</e>: basic experimental procedures.Small animal Magnetic Resonance (MR) research has emerged as an important element of modern biomedical research due to its non-invasive nature and the richness of biological information it provides. MR does not require any ionizing radiation and can noninvasively provide higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to other tomographic or spectroscopic modalities. In this protocol, we will focus on small animal MR imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) to noninvasively acquire relaxation weighted (1)H images of mouse and to obtain (31)P spectra of mouse muscle. This work does not attempt to cover every aspect of small animal MRI/MRS but rather introduces basic procedures of mouse MRI/MRS experiments. The main goal of this work is to inform researchers of the basic procedures for in vivo MR experiments on small animals. The goal is to provide a better understanding of basic experimental procedures to allow researchers new to the MR field to better plan for non-MR components of their studies so that both MR and non-MR procedures are seamlessly integrated.",M2
19841270,"Long-lived states to sustain hyperpolarized magnetization.Major breakthroughs have recently been reported that can help overcome two inherent drawbacks of NMR: the lack of sensitivity and the limited memory of longitudinal magnetization. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) couples nuclear spins to the large reservoir of electrons, thus making it possible to detect dilute endogenous substances in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<e>MRS</e>) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We have designed a method to preserve enhanced ( hyperpolarized ) magnetization by conversion into long-lived states (LLS). It is shown that these enhanced long-lived states can be generated for proton spins, which afford sensitive detection. Even in complex molecules such as peptides, long-lived proton states can be sustained effectively over time intervals on the order of tens of seconds, thus allowing hyperpolarized substrates to reach target areas and affording access to slow metabolic pathways. The natural abundance carbon-13 polarization has been enhanced ex situ by almost four orders of magnitude in the dipeptide Ala-Gly. The sample was transferred by the dissolution process to a high-resolution magnet where the carbon-13 polarization was converted into a long-lived state associated with a pair of protons. In Ala-Gly, the lifetime T(LLS) associated with the two nonequivalent H(alpha) glycine protons, sustained by suitable radio-frequency irradiation, was found to be seven times longer than their spin-lattice relaxation time constant (T(LLS)/T(1) = 7). At desired intervals, small fractions of the populations of long-lived states were converted into observable magnetization. This opens the way to observing slow chemical reactions and slow transport phenomena such as diffusion by enhanced magnetic resonance.",M2
