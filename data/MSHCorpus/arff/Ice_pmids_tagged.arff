19622171,"Drug use patterns among Thai illicit drug injectors amidst increased police presence.Thailand has traditionally pursued an aggressive enforcement-based anti-illicit drug policy in an effort to make the country  drug-free.  In light of this ongoing approach, we sought to assess impacts of enforcement on drug use behaviors among a cohort of injection drug users (IDU) in Thailand. We examined drug use patterns among IDU participating in a cross-sectional study conducted in Bangkok (n = 252). Participants were asked to provide data regarding patterns of drug use in the previous six months, including types of drugs consumed, method of consumption, frequency of use, and weekly income spent on drugs. We also conducted bivariate analyses to identify a possible effect of a reported increase in police presence on measures of drug use and related risk behaviors among study participants. One hundred fifty-five (61.5%) individuals reported injection heroin use and 132 (52.4%) individuals reported injection midazolam use at least daily in the past six months. Additionally, 86 (34.1%) individuals reported at least daily injection Yaba and <e>Ice</e> (i.e., methamphetamine) use. Participants in our study reported high levels of illicit drug use, including the injection of both illicit and licit drugs. In bivariate analyses, no association between increased police presence and drug use behaviors was observed. These findings demonstrate high ongoing rates of drug injecting in Thailand despite reports of increased levels of strict enforcement and enforcement-related violence, and raise questions regarding the merits of this approach.",M1
19207353,"Impact of US and Canadian precursor regulation on methamphetamine purity in the United States.AIMS: Reducing drug purity is a major, but largely unstudied, goal of drug suppression. This study examines whether US methamphetamine purity was impacted by the suppression policy of US and Canadian precursor chemical regulation. DESIGN: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-intervention time-series analysis. SETTING: Continental United States and Hawaii (1985-May 2005). Interventions US federal regulations targeting precursors, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, in forms used by large-scale producers were implemented in November 1989, August 1995 and October 1997. US regulations targeting precursors in forms used by small-scale producers (e.g. over-the-counter medications) were implemented in October 1996 and October 2001. Canada implemented federal precursor regulations in January 2003 and July 2003 and an essential chemical (e.g. acetone) regulation in January 2004. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly median methamphetamine purity series. FINDINGS: US regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with purity declines of 16-67 points; those targeting small-scale producers had little or no impact. Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases of 13-15 points, while its essential chemical regulation was associated with a 13-point decrease. Hawaii's purity was consistently high, and appeared to vary little with the 1990s/2000s regulations. CONCLUSIONS: US precursor regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with substantial decreases in continental US methamphetamine purity, while regulations targeting over-the-counter medications had little or no impact. Canada's essential chemical regulation was also associated with a decrease in continental US purity. However, Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases: these regulations may have impacted primarily producers of lower-quality methamphetamine, leaving higher-purity methamphetamine on the market by default. Hawaii's well-known preference for '<e>ice</e>' (high-purity methamphetamine) may have helped to constrain purity there to a high, attenuated range, possibly limiting its sensitivity to precursor regulation.",M1
18803173," <e>Ice</e>  use and eating disorders: a report of three cases.OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride  ice,  a powerful, synthetic stimulant drug associated with rapid weight loss. METHOD: We report the first three cases of young women  ice  users requiring admission to a specialized eating disorders unit. RESULTS: Case one had no prior history of an eating disorder and became emaciated following regular use of  ice ; she regarded weight gain positively. Case 2 had polysubstance abuse since early adolescence and commenced binge eating and vomiting in response to weight gain when not using  ice ; she learned to maintain her weight without weight losing behaviors. Case 3 developed anorexia nervosa in early adolescence, required numerous inpatient admissions and commenced using stimulant drugs for weight loss in her late teens; she discharged prematurely. All patients had features of personality disorder on interview and drug abuse had impaired their work and social adjustment. DISCUSSION:  Ice  use may be associated with the onset of disordered eating or used as an efficient weight losing behavior in an established eating disorder.",M1

18368603,"The prevalence of methamphetamine and amphetamine abuse in North America: a review of the indicators, 1992-2007.INTRODUCTION: This paper reviews epidemiological information about methamphetamine production and use in North America. METHODS: Information is drawn from a range of sources, including, but not limited to, historical accounts, peer-reviewed papers, population surveys and large national databases. RESULTS: Methamphetamine and amphetamine use in North America is characterised by geographic variations, with different types of the drug, different routes of administration and different types of users at various times. Unlike some other drug use patterns in North America, the nature of methamphetamine use in Canada, Mexico and the United States has been linked closely in terms of production and supply of the drug. According to their national household surveys, the annual prevalence for 'speed' use in Canada was 0.8% in 2004, 0.3% for 'anfetaminas' and 0.1% for 'metanfetaminas' in Mexico in 2002, and 1.4% for 'stimulants' in the United States in 2006. DISCUSSION: Although the data sources in the three North American countries are not consistent in methodology, terminology or frequency of reporting, all show similar trends. The type of stimulant most used has shifted from non-medical use of pharmaceutical amphetamine to use of powder methamphetamine and then to use of '<e>ice</e>'. The indicators show the problem is greatest in the western parts of the countries and is moving eastward, but the decreased availability of pseudoephedrine may have a significant impact on the nature of the epidemic in the future. Nevertheless, use of methamphetamine poses a number of risks for users and specialised treatment resources for these various populations are needed.",M1
18082974,"A comparison of the physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and microglial effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in the mouse.3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH) are amphetamine analogues with similar persistent neurochemical effects in the mouse which some have described as neurotoxicity. We attempted to identify dose regimens of MDMA and METH with similar effects on behavioral and physiological variables in the mouse, then quantified the effects of these dose regimens on neurochemistry and microglial markers. Four discrete injections of saline, MDMA (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg), or METH (5 or 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice at 2 h intervals. Body weight was quantified immediately before each injection, and 2 h after the last injection, while core temperature and locomotor activity were continuously monitored via radiotelemetry. Mice were killed 72 h after the final injection and brains were rapidly dissected on <e>ice</e>. Dopamine content in various brain regions was quantified via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and microglial activation was assessed by saturation binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(3)H]PK11195). Specific dose regimens of MDMA and METH induced similar reductions in body weight, depletions of dopamine and its metabolites, and similar hyperthermic and locomotor stimulant effects, but only METH activated microglia in striatum. These results suggest that repeated high doses of MDMA and METH that produce hyperthermia, locomotor stereotypy, weight loss and neurochemical depletion are not consistently accompanied by microglial activation. The finding that METH, but not MDMA, induces microglial effects in the striatum consistent with neurotoxicity might imply different mechanisms of toxic action for these two psychostimulants.",M1
18021044,"Comparison of crystalline methamphetamine ( <e>ice</e> ) users and other patients with toxicology-related problems presenting to a hospital emergency department.OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic and clinical characteristics of methamphetamine users and patients with other toxicology-related problems requiring medical intervention in a hospital emergency department (ED). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study of toxicology-related presentations to the ED of St Vincent's Hospital (SVH), Sydney, an inner-city tertiary hospital, between 1 October and 31 December 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to the ED in relation to behaviour, mode of arrival, accompaniment, need for scheduling, location of drug use, intravenous drug use history, psychiatric history and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: During the study period there were 10 305 patient presentations to SVH ED; 449 (4%) were toxicology-related presentations, of which 100 (1% of total) were methamphetamine-related. Methamphetamine users were significantly more agitated, violent and aggressive than patients with other toxicology-related presentations and significantly less alert, communicative and cooperative (P &lt; 0.001); 24% of methamphetamine users (24/100) arrived with police accompaniment versus 9% of other toxicology patients (33/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Methamphetamine users were more likely to have a history of intravenous drug use and mental health problems (P &lt; 0.001); 39% of methamphetamine presentations (39/100) required scheduling under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) compared with 19% of other toxicology-related presentations (67/349) (P &lt; 0.001); 43% of methamphetamine-related presentations (43/100) involved drug use on the street compared with 24% of other toxicology-related presentations (83/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Two-thirds of all methamphetamine users were male, and the most common age group for both male and female users was 26-30 years. The mean age and sex distribution of patients with other toxicology-related presentations were not significantly different. Among methamphetamine users, 27% of women (9/33) were in the 21-25-year age group compared with 10% (7/67) of men (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: There were significant differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to SVH ED. Methamphetamine users were more aggressive, violent and dangerous, and thus more likely to pose a risk to health personnel and others. Methamphetamine appeared to be used consistently, rather than as an episodic  party drug .",M1

The results of the study indicated that both male and female adolescents who used methamphetamine were significantly more likely to participate in aggressive behaviors and sexual risks (i.e., numerous sex partners). The inclusion of grade point averages in a logistic regression equation revealed that White adolescents were more likely than other ethnicities to indicate that they had used methamphetamine and the inclusion of student grade point averages reduced male gender to nonsignificance. We also discuss the limitations of the study.",M1
17536161,"Smokable ( <e>ice</e> ,  crystal meth ) and non smokable amphetamine-type stimulants: clinical pharmacological and epidemiological issues, with special reference to the UK. Ice ,  crystal meth , is the smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride. This paper will comment on the pharmacological, epidemiological, clinical and social issues related to smoking the drug as opposed to either its injection or ingestion. Furthermore, some data related to amphetamines/methamphetamines consumption, request for treatment, seizures, related offences and deaths in the UK (1990-2002) will be offered here. Peak rates, for most indicators, were reached at the end of the '90s, to fall down in the following years. The only indicator which seemed not to show any declining rates is number of deaths, but this may be related to a more general increase in stimulant death rates recently observed in the UK. It is argued that methamphetamines, and particularly  crystal meth , could reach the same prevalence levels of use in the UK as it is already in the US but recent reclassification of the drug to Class A in the UK could help to better control this emerging issue.",M1

17364831,"MDMA, methamphetamine and their combination: possible lessons for party drug users from recent preclinical research.The substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') and methamphetamine (METH, '<e>ice</e>', 'speed') are increasingly popular drugs amongst party-drug users. Studies with humans have investigated the acute and possible long-term adverse effects of these drugs, yet outcomes of such studies are often ambiguous due to a variety of confounding factors. Studies employing animal models have value in determining the acute and long-term effects of MDMA and METH on brain and behaviour. Self-administration studies show that intravenous METH is a particularly potent reinforcer in rats and other species. In contrast, MDMA appears to have powerful effects in enhancing social behaviour in laboratory animals. Brief exposure to MDMA or METH may produce long-term reductions in dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain and alterations in the density of various receptor and transporter proteins. However it is still unclear, particularly in the case of MDMA, whether this reflects a 'neurotoxic' effect of the drug. Lasting alterations in social behaviour, anxiety, depressive symptoms and memory have been demonstrated in laboratory rats given MDMA or METH and this matches long-term changes reported in some human studies. Recent laboratory studies suggest that MDMA/METH combinations may produce greater adverse neurochemical and behavioural effects than either drug alone. This is of some concern given recent evidence that party drug users may be frequently exposed to this combination of drugs.",M1
17262233,"[Optic neuropathy induced by prenatal drug or alcohol exposure]PURPOSE: The main aim of this work was to analyse the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in retinal and optic nerve development, and the consequences of methamphetamine  <e>ice</e>  (MA) or alcohol (EtOH) abuse during pregnancy on the developing visual system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed to MA or EtOH during gestation and lactation and their offspring studied. Control isocaloric rats were maintained in parallel. The eyes and optic nerves from pups (at 7, 14 and 21 postnatal days) were processed using morphologic, morphometric and western blot approaches using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP) and neurofilament protein (NFP). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the methamphetamine-exposed and the alcohol-exposed rats, as compared to the controls. The optic nerve cross-sectional area was smaller in the drug or alcohol-exposed animals. The expression of developmental protein markers (GFAP and MBP) in the retina and optic nerve displayed striking alterations related to drug or alcohol abuse during gestation and lactation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychostimulant and alcohol exposure alters the development of the retina and optic nerve.",M1
16769452,"Drug use and risk of HIV/AIDS on the Mexico-USA border: a comparison of treatment admissions in both countries.This study analyzes trends in treatment admissions and summarizes HIV/AIDS risk factors along the US-Mexican border. Data are presented at the national level and at the state level for states along the border. Client data also are compared for treatment programs located in sister cities on the Texas-Mexico border. These data show that methamphetamine admissions are increasing nationally and methamphetamine use is a major problem in the western states on both sides of the border. Use of <e>Ice</e> (smoked methamphetamine) has increased significantly. Use of crack (smoked cocaine) is a growing problem on the border, and injection is the primary route for using black tar heroin in this area. Each of these drugs is a risk factor, either from drug-influenced risky sexual behaviors or from sharing injection equipment. In addition, the availability of drugs on the border and patterns of risky behaviors among migrants mean that drug users on the border are at risk of HIV/AIDS, and this risk is expected to increase with the spreading methamphetamine epidemic and smoking of crack cocaine. Comparable data on HIV/AIDS are needed for further studies of the relationship of drug use and HIV/AIDS on the border.",M1
15061561,"Neighborhood environment and opportunity to try methamphetamine ( <e>ice</e> ) and marijuana: evidence from Guam in the Western Pacific region of Micronesia.Although the American popular press and films might generally lead one to think otherwise, illegal drug use and drug trafficking occur outside the boundaries of disadvantaged American inner-city neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the occurrence of youthful drug involvement may be determined by similar community conditions in many parts of the world. In Spring 1998, a probability sample of 776 high school students living in Guam, Micronesia, completed a self-report anonymous survey, one that assessed their village and metropolitan neighborhood environments as well as drug involvement. On Guam, higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage were associated with youths being more likely to have been offered a chance to try drugs. This study adds new evidence on the potential importance of environmental and psychosocial contexts of neighborhood environment that might help account for the nonrandom distribution of youthful drug involvement.",M1
15011896,"Acute coronary syndrome and crystal methamphetamine use: a case series. <e>Ice</e>  is a form of methamphetamine commonly used as a recreational drug in Hawaii and the Philippines, but seldom encountered in the continental United States. It differs in appearance from methamphetamine tablets, but otherwise has exactly the same molecules, only arranged in a crystalline structure. A sizeable body of in vitro, animal, and autopsy data suggest a linkage between methamphetamine use and myocardial pathology. In this report, we describe a series of eight patients who developed unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction in association with smoking crystal methamphetamine. The findings, to a large extent, resemble those with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. Given the widespread abuse of methamphetamine among young age groups, the recognition and primary prevention of cardiovascular toxic effects is of mounting socioeconomic importance.",M1
12537703,"The emergence of potent forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, Australia: a case study of the IDRS as a strategic early warning system.A striking finding of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) in recent years has concerned the emergence in Sydney of a number of different forms of potent methamphetamine. This paper demonstrates the operation of the IDRS in detecting and documenting an increase in both the availability and use of these forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, and Australia more widely, since 1998. Data from different components of the IDRS are utilized to propose that there are currently at least three forms of methamphetamine available in Sydney that are considered by the market to be distinct commodities: methamphetamine powder ('speed'), base methamphetamine ('base') and crystalline methamphetamine ('<e>ice</e>'/'shabu'/'crystal meth'). Base and ice are more potent forms of methamphetamine than speed, and international experience, along with preliminary data obtained from the IDRS, suggest that their use is associated with harms in a number of domains.",M1
11831497,"Patterns of methamphetamine abuse and their consequences.The abuse of methamphetamine (METH) continues to increase throughout all age groups in different regions of the United States.  <e>Ice</e>,  the popularized jargon for (+) methamphetamine hydrochloride, is the predominant drug form that is now consumed.  Ice  is effectively absorbed after either smoking or snorting and it is this rapid influx of drug that produces effects similar to those after intravenous administration. The intensity of METH actions in the central and peripheral nervous system shows tolerance after chronic administration, indicating that neuroadaptations have occurred. Thus, the physiological processes and corresponding biochemical mechanisms that regulate neuronal function have been changed by METH exposure. These biological alterations contribute to the craving and dependence associated with METH abuse and the withdrawal syndrome upon abstinence. However, these changes in behavior may also result from METH-induced neurotoxicity. This article reviews aspects of METH pharmacokinetics and related molecular pharmacodynamics that represent METH pharmacology and then relates those actions to their potential to produce neurotoxicity in humans.",M1
11224724,"Airway effects of marijuana, cocaine, and other inhaled illicit agents.Several substances besides tobacco are inhaled for recreational purposes, including marijuana, crack cocaine, amyl and butyl nitrites, heroin, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine. Abuse of most of these inhaled substances has risen in recent years, thereby increasing concern about potential pulmonary and other medical complications. Regular marijuana use can lead to extensive airway injury and alterations in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection and respiratory cancer. Crack cocaine use can lead to a variety of acute pulmonary complications, including severe exacerbations of asthma and an acute lung injury syndrome associated with a broad spectrum of histopathologic changes ( crack lung ). Habitual cocaine smoking may also produce more subtle long-term pulmonary consequences due to chronic alveolar epithelial and microvascular lung injury. Heroin inhalation can induce severe and even fatal exacerbations of asthma. Pulmonary consequences of inhaled amyl and butyl nitrites, crystalline methamphetamine (<e>ice</e>), and phencyclidine have been less well documented.",M1
11085306,"Two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344 and Lewis, showed differential behavior and brain expression of corticosterone receptor mRNA induced by methamphetamine.Recently, a role of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis in facilitating the behavioral and neurochemical effects of psychostimulants has been proposed. Two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344/N (F344) and Lewis/N (LEW), have markedly different HPA axes as well as behavioral responses to psychostimulants: F344 rats show hyperresponsive HPA axis and no significant sensitization to cocaine, whereas LEW rats display blunted response in HPA axis and develop cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Corticosterone exerts its biological effects via intracellular receptors, termed type I (mineralocorticoid receptor: MR) and type II (glucocorticoid receptor: GR). The present study examines the development of stereotypy sensitization and the brain expression of mRNAs for MR, GR, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in methamphetamine (MAP)-treated F344 and LEW rats. Animals received i.p. injections with chronic saline (SAL: once daily for 21 days), chronic saline and acute MAP (AM: saline for 20 days and 4 mg/kg MAP on the 21st day), or chronic MAP (CM: 4 mg/kg MAP for 21 days) and were sacrificed three hours after the last injections. Striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were quickly dissected on <e>ice</e> and total RNA was isolated for northern analyses. LEW rats developed stereotypy sensitization significantly earlier than F344 rats. AM significantly decreased GR and MR mRNA expression in hippocampus of LEW, compared to SAL. CM significantly increased GR and MR mRNA expression in striatum of F344 compared to SAL and AM, while it decreased GR mRNA in striatum of LEW and MR mRNA in hippocampus, compared to SAL. AM significantly increased HSP90 mRNA in all brain regions examined, without the hippocampus in LEW. CM significantly increased the expression of HSP90 mRNA in the striatum and cerebellum of F344, but significantly decreased in the striatum and hippocampus of LEW. These contrasting differences between F344 and LEW, in their susceptibility to stereotypy sensitization and striatal expression of GR mRNA by chronic MAP, suggest that some striatal genes, whose transcription is regulated by GR, play a crucial role in the development of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization.",M1

10357249,"Neuroadaptations in the dopaminergic system after active self-administration but not after passive administration of methamphetamine.Methamphetamine is a strong and long-lasting stimulant that can be easily synthesized and is effective when taken either orally, intravenously, or smoked as '<e>ice</e>'. Due to it's escalating abuse, a clear need exists for laboratory procedures to evaluate motivational components of methamphetamine abuse and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In the present experiment, we utilized a 'yoked' procedure in which rats were run simultaneously in groups of three, with two rats serving as yoked controls which received an injection of either 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine or saline which was not contingent on responding each time a response-contingent injection of 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine was self-administered by the third paired rat. Rats that had actively self-administered methamphetamine for 5 weeks and were then withdrawn from methamphetamine for 24 h showed marked decreases in somatodendritic dopamine D2 autoreceptors levels in the ventral tegmental area (34%) and medial (31%) and dorsal (21%) part of the substantia nigra zona compacta with a corresponding down-regulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (15%), as measured by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Since the decreases in levels of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors which occurred in rats self-administering methamphetamine did not occur in littermates that received either yoked injections of methamphetamine or saline, these changes likely reflect motivational states that were present when methamphetamine injection depended on active drug self-administration behavior.",M1
9542724,"Free radicals and the pathobiology of brain dopamine systems.Oxygen is an essential element for normal life. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can also participate in deleterious reactions that can affect lipid, protein, and nucleic acid. Normal physiological function thus depends on a balance between these ROS and the scavenging systems that aerobic organisms have developed over millennia. Tilting of that balance towards a pro-oxidant state might result from both endogenous and exogenous causes. In the present paper, we elaborate on the thesis that the neurodegenerative effects of two drugs, namely methamphetamine (METH, <e>ICE</e>) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) are due to ROS overproduction in monoaminergic systems in the brain. We also discuss the role of oxygen-based species in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and in Parkinson's disease.

The same volunteers were given an intravenous injection of 15.5 mg of S-(+)-methamphetamine hydrochloride. Methamphetamine and its metabolite amphetamine were analyzed in plasma, saliva, and urine by gas chromatography. The bioavailability of smoked methamphetamine was 90.3 +/- 10.4%. (Oral bioavailability calculated from this study and a previous one was 67.2 +/- 3.1%). The geometric mean plasma half-life was 11.1 hr for smoked methamphetamine and 12.2 hr for the intravenous drug. These values agreed with urinary excretion rate data. The volume of distribution in the elimination phase was 3.24 +/- 0.36 liter/kg for the smoked dose and 3.73 +/- 0.59 liter/kg for the intravenous dose. The mean residence times were 11.5 +/- 0.5 hr and 11.3 +/- 1.74 hr for the two routes. Metabolic clearance represented 58 and 55%, respectively, of the total clearance. Significant amounts of the drug (37-45% of the nominal dose) were excreted in urine as methamphetamine and lesser amounts (7% of the nominal molar dose) as amphetamine. Renal clearance was equivalent for the two routes. Methamphetamine concentrations in plasma after inhalation showed a plateau. A model involving both a fast and a slow input function fit the data from 4 of the 6 subjects and indicated a terminal elimination rate that agreed with results from model-independent pharmacokinetic calculations.

The toxic effects of methamphetamine smoking have not been well described. We describe two patients with cardiovascular toxic effects associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine. In our first patient, the use of smokeable methamphetamine was associated with the subsequent development of pulmonary edema and a dilated cardiomyopathy. In our second patient, the smoking of crystal methamphetamine likely produced diffuse vasospasm that resulted in acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and death. The recognition of potentially lethal cardiac complications associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine is of extreme significance and should be emphasized to potential abusers of this drug.",M1

Under controlled laboratory conditions, six subjects were studied. Plasma concentrations of methamphetamine were determined, and subjective and cardiovascular effects were measured. Methamphetamine appeared in plasma rapidly, increased slowly over the next four hours and then progressively declined. The dose of methamphetamine administered produced modest ratings of subjective drug effects, and moderate changes in cardiovascular parameters. Both subjective and cardiovascular effects rapidly decreased despite the presence of sustained concentrations of methamphetamine in plasma.",M1

2085287,"[Methamphetamine abuse by smoking]Three cases of methamphetamine abuse by smoking were reported. The oral intake and the intravenous injection of the drug are usually adopted, and the smoking is recently found among the stimulant abusers in Japan. The stimulant is heated on a piece of aluminium foil with a lighter and its smoke is inhaled with a straw or a paper pipe. The intake means are identical to  crystal or <e>ice</e>  in Hawaii, although a special glass pipe or a cigarette is not used here. The effect of the drug obtained by smoking is more slack and mild than that by a intravenous injection, although the drug of the double dose is used in the smoking. Two cases changed the intake means from the injection to the smoking because of no guilty feeling and a lack of injection marks and evident proofs of illegal use. Therefore, abuse of methamphetamine by smoking is thought to increase in near future in Japan, and the delusion of arrest by policemen observed frequently in the stimulant abusers maybe decreases as a result of a decrease in the psychological stress of guilty.",M1

Crystal methamphetamine  is a crystalline form of amphetamine, the abuse of which is growing rapidly in popularity in Japan, Hawaii and the West Coast. Drug experts and law enforcement officials say that the use of crystal meth is spreading east from California. It may produce permanent addiction and can produce violent schizophrenic behavior. Introduced along the Leeward Coast of Hawaii about 3 years ago, it is now being used throughout Oahu and is starting to rival cocaine as the illicit drug of choice in Hawaii. It is also the major drug problem in Japan, where the powder form is called  shabu.

20047158,"<e>ICE</e>/caspase 1 inhibitors and IL-1beta receptor antagonists as potential therapeutics in epilepsy.Epilepsy is a disabling neurological disorder that is characterized by recurring, unprovoked seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy affects approximately 30% of individuals with epilepsy; thus, one of the main challenges for epilepsy therapy is the development of alternative anticonvulsant approaches. The discovery that inflammatory mediators contribute significantly to the onset and recurrence of seizures in experimental models, as well as the presence of inflammatory molecules in human epileptogenic tissue, highlight the possibility of targeting specific inflammation-related pathways to control seizures that are otherwise resistant to the available anti-epileptic drugs. This review summarizes the proof-of-principle evidence, obtained in experimental disease models, demonstrating the anticonvulsant activity of specific anti-inflammatory drugs, such as inhibitors of IL-1-converting enzyme/caspase 1 and antagonists of IL-1beta receptors. Drugs that block IL-1beta actions have entered clinical trials as potential therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies, and may also have therapeutic potential in epilepsies associated with proinflammatory processes in the brain.",M2
19834516,"Imaging and therapy of experimental schwannomas using HSV amplicon vector-encoding apoptotic protein under Schwann cell promoter.Schwannomas are benign tumors forming along peripheral nerves that can cause deafness, pain and paralysis. Current treatment involves surgical resection, which can damage associated nerves. To achieve tumor regression without damage to nerve fibers, we generated an HSV amplicon vector in which the apoptosis-inducing enzyme, caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>), was placed under the Schwann cell-specific P0 promoter. Infection of schwannoma, neuroblastoma and fibroblastic cells in culture with ICE under the P0 promoter showed selective toxicity to schwannoma cells, while ICE under a constitutive promoter was toxic to all cell types. After direct intratumoral injection of the P0-ICE amplicon vector, we achieved marked regression of schwannoma tumors in an experimental xenograft mouse model. Injection of this amplicon vector into the sciatic nerve produced no apparent injury to the associated dorsal root ganglia neurons or myelinated nerve fibers. The P0-ICE amplicon vector provides a potential means of 'knifeless resection' of schwannoma tumors by injection of the vector into the tumor with low risk of damage to associated nerve fibers.",M2
19737897,"Bacillus anthracis capsule activates caspase-1 and induces interleukin-1beta release from differentiated THP-1 and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.The poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid (PGA) capsule is one of the major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis, which causes a highly lethal infection. The antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance and allows unimpeded growth of bacilli in the host. Recently, efforts have been made to include PGA as a component of anthrax vaccine; however, the innate immune response of PGA itself has been poorly investigated. In this study, we characterized the innate immune response elicited by PGA in the human monocytic cell line THP-1, which was differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hMoDCs). PGA capsules were isolated from the culture supernatant of either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a. PGA treatment of differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs led to the specific extracellular release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in a dose-dependent manner. Evaluation of IL-1beta processing by Western blotting revealed that cleaved IL-1beta increased in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after PGA treatment. Enhanced processing of IL-1beta directly correlated with increased activation of its upstream regulator, caspase-1, also known as IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). The extracellular release of IL-1beta in response to PGA was ICE dependent, since the administration of an ICE inhibitor prior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1beta. These results demonstrate that B. anthracis PGA elicits IL-1beta production through activation of ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, suggesting the potential for PGA as a therapeutic target for anthrax.",M2
19618605,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 exerts inhibitory effect on neointimal formation after vascular injury.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) on neointimal formation after vascular injury in the mouse, and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Vascular injury was induced by polyethylene cuff placement around the left femoral artery of IRF-1-deficient mice and C57BL/6J mice. The mRNA expressions of IRF-1, IRF-2, angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Neointimal formation after vascular injury was significantly greater in IRF-1-deficient mice than that in C57BL/6J mice (P&lt;0.05). In contrast, TUNEL-positive nuclei to total nuclei in the neointima and media in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) in the injured artery significantly attenuated in IRF-1-deficient mice compared to C57BL/6J mice (P&lt;0.05). The expressions of AT2 receptor as well as pro-apoptotic genes such as ICE and iNOS in C57BL/6J mice were up-regulated in response to vascular injury, but this upregulation was attenuated in IRF-1-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IRF-1 induces VSMC apoptosis and inhibits neointimal formation after vascular injury at least partly due to the upregulation of AT2 receptor, ICE and iNOS expressions. These results indicate that IRF-1 exerts an inhibitory effect on neointimal formation through the induction of apoptosis in VSMCs.",M2
19386010,"Use of gene profiling to evaluate the effects of a feed additive on immune function in periparturient dairy cattle.Objectives were to investigate mechanisms by which a nutritional supplement alters immunity in dairy cattle. Our hypothesis was that feeding this product to dairy cattle altered neutrophil gene expression. Eight periparturient Jersey cattle were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: control and treated. Control animals were fed a dry cow ration for 1 month prior to calving. The treated cows were fed the same ration supplemented with OmniGen-AF. Following calving, blood samples were taken and neutrophils were prepared after which RNA was extracted. Gene expression in neutrophils of treated versus control-fed animals was then assessed using bovine-total leukocyte (BOTL-5) arrays. Eighteen genes were differentially regulated in the experimental group and of these, twice as many were up-regulated as down-regulated. Patterns of changes indicated that the additive might alter neutrophil apoptosis, signaling and sensitivity. Two of the regulated genes [interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R)] were investigated in more detail using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Each was found to be elevated by the feeding of experimental product. Increased expression of ICE indicates potential for enhanced neutrophil expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a cytokine which plays roles in the inflammatory response and which stimulates adaptive immunity following innate immune activation. Altered expression of IL-4R indicates potential for changes in neutrophil apoptosis. The experiment identified mechanisms by which the additive altered neutrophil gene expression. While many nutrients support the immune system, we have shown that a non-traditional nutritional approach may also have utility in modulating immune function.",M2
19120479,"Inflammasomes: guardians of cytosolic sanctity.The innate immune system is critical in recognizing bacterial and viral infections to evoke a proper immune response. Certain members of the intracellular nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family detect microbial components in the cytosol and trigger the assembly of large caspase-1-activating complexes termed inflammasomes. Autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-1 zymogens within these inflammasomes leads to maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-18. The NLR proteins <e>ICE</e> protease-activating factor (IPAF), NALP1b (NACHT domain-, leucine-rich repeat-, and PYD-containing protein 1b), and cryopyrin/NALP3 assemble caspase-1-activating inflammasomes in a stimulus-dependent manner. Bacterial flagellin is sensed by IPAF, whereas mouse NALP1b detects anthrax lethal toxin. Cryopyrin/NALP3 mediates caspase-1 activation in response to a wide variety of microbial components and in response to crystalline substances such as the endogenous danger signal uric acid. Genetic variations in Nalp1 and cryopyrin/Nalp3 are associated with autoinflammatory disorders and increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Further understanding of inflammasomes and their role in innate immunity should provide new insights into the mechanisms of host defense and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",M2
19046143,"LPS increases the expression levels of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in mouse testes.PROBLEM: This study examined the effect of intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to adult male mouse on the expression levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and the IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) (IL-18 family) in their testes and spleen (control). METHOD OF STUDY: Adult mice were injected (intraperitoneally; i.p.) with saline (control) or LPS (2, 20, 100 microg/mL; 100 microL/mouse). After 3 and 24 hr, testes and spleen were collected. Testicular tissue was examined for IL-18 (by ELISA, real time PCR, and western blot analysis), IL-18R and ICE (western blot and real time PCR analysis) and spleen tissue was examined for the IL-18 family by real time PCR analysis. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Homogenates of mouse testes contain and express basal levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18 R. The expression levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18R were significantly increased 3 and 24 hr after intraperitoneal injection of LPS to mature mouse, as examined by ELISA, western blot and real time PCR analysis. However, the expression levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18Ralpha in the spleen increased significantly only after 24 hr of LPS stimulation, as examined by real time PCR. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LPS increases the expression levels of the IL-18 family in mouse testis and spleen, but the time of expression differs between the two organs. The presence of IL-18 in the testes might be involved in the regulation of physiological and infection/inflammatory processes, and may be part of the autocrine/paracrine factors that control spermatogenesis. Further studies should be performed to confirm this possibility.",M2
18980715,"Protective effect of estrogen on apoptosis in a cell culture model of Parkinson's disease.OBJECTIVES: The protective effect of estrogen on the neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen on the apoptosis and dopaminergic function on a cultured cell model of PD. METHODS: The PD model was established by addition of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to PC12 cell culture. Estrogen was added to cell groups with MPP+ (Estrogen+MPP+), and without MPP+ (Estrogen only group). Cell viability, content of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), apoptosis ratio, expression of apoptosis-suppression protein Bcl-x and apoptosis-acceleration protein IL-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) were measured. RESULTS: Cell viability in the Estrogen+MPP+ group was similar to the control group but was higher than in the MPP+ group (P &lt; 0.05). The apoptosis ratios in the Estrogen+MPP+ group (33.6%), and the control group (31.3%), were also similar, but it was lower than in the MPP+ group (63.5%, P &lt; 0.05). Concentrations of Bcl-x were higher in the Estrogen+MPP+ group, whereas ICE concentrations were lower than in the MPP+ group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen suppresses apoptosis and improves cell viability in MPP+ induced injuries in the PC12 cells. The beneficial effects of estrogen on the PD model are due to the suppression of pro-apoptotic protein ICE, and stimulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x.",M2
18946358,"Helicobacter pylori infection upregulates interleukin-18 production from gastric epithelial cells.BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection induces a biased T helper type 1 (Th1) response that produces IFN-gamma and Fas ligand (FasL). Th1 cytokines are associated with apoptosis in the gastric epithelial cells. AIM: We aimed to define the role of the recently cloned IL-18, a IFN-gamma inducing factor, in gastric mucosal injury induced by H. pylori infection. METHODS: Twenty-seven gastric ulcer (GU) patients and 20 functional dyspepsia (FD) patients were enrolled in this study. Mucosal biopsy samples were obtained from the gastric antrum and GU site during endoscopy. Samples were used for histological examination, H. pylori culture and in-situ stimulation for 48 h in the presence of 10 microg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P. IL-18, IFN-gamma, and soluble FasL (sFasL) levels in culture supernatants were assayed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. IL-18, IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and caspase-3 were evaluated by western blotting in gastric cancer cell lines (MKN45) cocultured with H. pylori. RESULTS: All 27 GU patients and ten out of 20 FD patients were found to be H. pylori-positive, whereas ten FD patients were H. pylori-negative. Antral mucosal tissues from H. pylori-positive FD patients contained (P&lt;0.01) higher levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL than those from uninfected FD patients. IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL levels at the ulcer site were significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher than those at distant sites in the antrum. A significant relationship was seen between IL-18 and IFN-gamma levels at the ulcer site (r=0.7, P&lt;0.01). H. pylori eradication led to a significant decrease in the levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL at the ulcer site. Western blotting showed that IL-18, ICE, and caspase-3 were activated in gastric cancer cell lines cocultured with H. pylori. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that H. pylori infection enhanced mucosal injury by stimulating a Th1 response, which was mediated by IL-18 upregulation as well as activation of ICE and caspase-3.",M2
18831059,"Monoamine oxidase-B activity is not involved in the neuroinflammatory response elicited by a focal freeze brain injury.Cryolesion of the frontoparietal cortex in mice is a well-described brain injury paradigm that results in increased astrogliosis surrounding the lesion site and is accompanied by a prominent increase in the MAO-B levels in astrocytes. Whether these increased MAO-B levels contribute to cellular damage or modulate reactive astrocytosis remains unclear. MAO-B activity may contribute to cellular damage, since its metabolism products are highly toxic to the cells. Additionally, it has been suggested that MAO-B inhibition may regulate astrocytic reaction. In this study, we have determined the relative contribution of MAO-B activity to the outcome following freeze injury. Freeze injury induced a prominent increase of several inflammatory markers, including ICAM, Mac-1, EB22, and GFAP. Inhibition of MAO-B activity using the selective inhibitor PF9601N did not reduce this cryolesion-induced inflammatory response. Additional data revealed that the expression of several cryolesion-induced cell death genes, such as Fas, Rip, p53, and <e>ICE</e>, was not reduced in PF9601N-treated mice, evidencing that MAO-B activity did not contribute to cryolesion-induced cell death. Definitive functional analysis of the mice using the ladder beam task revealed that MAO-B inhibition did not improve the cryolesion-induced motor impairment. These data strongly suggest that, although MAO-B is highly expressed in the area surrounding the lesion site, its activity does not contribute to the cellular damage or play any role in regulating astrocytic reactivity.",M2
18705842,"Lipopolysaccharide increased the expression levels of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in murine Leydig cells.PROBLEM: This study examined the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the capacity of Leydig cells to produce and express interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and the IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) (IL-18 family), under in vitro conditions. METHOD OF STUDY: Primary Leydig cells (LCs) were isolated from murine testis by the Percoll technique, and cultured both in the presence and absence of LPS (0.1, 1, 5 microg/mL) for 3 and 24 hr. LCs were examined for their capacity to produce and express IL-18 family molecules by using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Leydig cells were shown to constitutively express IL-18, as examined by IHC, ELISA, Western blot and real-time PCR analysis. Addition of LPS to LC cultures was shown to significantly increase the basal levels of IL-18, in a dose- and time course-dependent manner, as examined by ELISA, Western blot and real-time PCR analysis. In addition, LPS increased LC cultures to express ICE and IL-18 R, as examined by real-time PCR analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LPS increased the capacity of murine LCs to produce the IL-18 family molecules. IL-18, in the testis, might be involved in the regulation of physiological and infection/inflammatory processes, and thus, could be a component of the autocrine/paracrine factor net that controls steroidogenesis and male fertility; further studies are needed to confirm this possibility.",M2
18632279,"Interleukin Converting Enzyme inhibition impairs kindling epileptogenesis in rats by blocking astrocytic IL-1beta production.An enhanced production of IL-1beta in glia is a typical feature of epileptogenic tissue in experimental models and in human drug-refractory epilepsy. We show here that the selective inhibition of Interleukin Converting Enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), which cleaves the biologically active form of IL-1beta using VX-765, blocks kindling development in rats by preventing IL-1beta increase in forebrain astrocytes, without interfering with glia activation. The average afterdischarge duration was not altered significantly by VX-765. Up to 24 h after kindling completion and drug washout, kindled seizures could not be evoked in treated rats. VX-765 did not affect seizures or afterdischarge duration in fully kindled rats. These data indicate an antiepileptogenic effect mediated by ICE inhibition and suggest that specific anti-IL-1beta pharmacological strategies can be envisaged to interfere with epileptogenic mechanisms.",M2
18304957,"Genetic variation in the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme associates with cognitive function. The PROSPER study.Inflammation is thought to play an important role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia in old age. The interleukin-1 signalling pathway may play a prominent role in this process. The gene encoding for interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) is likely to influence IL-1 beta levels. Inhibition of ICE decreases the age-related increase in IL-1 beta levels and may therefore improve memory function. We assessed whether genetic variation in the ICE gene associates with cognitive function in an elderly population. All 5804 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) were genotyped for the 10643GC, 9323GA, 8996AG and 5352GA polymorphisms in the ICE gene. Cross-sectional associations between the polymorphisms and cognitive function were assessed with linear regression. Longitudinal associations between polymorphisms, haplotypes and cognitive function were assessed with linear mixed models. All associations were adjusted for sex, age, education, country, treatment with pravastatin and version of test where appropriate. Subjects carrying the variants 10643C and 5352A allele had significantly lower IL-1 beta production levels (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, we demonstrated that homozygous carriers of the 10643C and the 5352A allele performed better on all executive function tests at baseline and during follow-up compared to homozygous carriers of the wild-type allele (all P &lt; 0.02). The haplotype with two variants present (10643C and 5352A) was associated with better executive function (all P &lt; 0.02) compared to the reference haplotype without variants. For memory function the same trend was observed, although not significant. Genetic variation in the ICE gene is associated with better performance on cognitive function and lower IL-1 beta production levels. This suggests that low levels of IL-1 beta are protective for memory and learning deficits. Inhibition of ICE may therefore be an important therapeutic target for maintaining cognitive function in old age.",M2
18299270,"Over-expression of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in testicular tissue from sexually immature as compared to mature mice.In this study we examined the cellular origin and the expression levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), which activates pro-IL-18, during normal maturation of murine testis. The levels of IL-18, IL-18R and ICE were significantly higher in testicular tissues and homogenates (but not in the spleen or liver) from sexually immature than mature mice. Immunohistochemical staining of testicular tissues from sexually immature and mature mice shows that testicular germ cells and Leydig cells/interstitial cells express higher levels of IL-18, as compared to other testicular cells. Peritubular cells of sexually immature and mature mice also expressed IL-18. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, over-expression of the IL-18 family in testicular tissues of sexually immature mice, as compared to mature mice, as well as the expression of IL-18 in the different stages of differentiation of testicular germ cells. Thus, our results may indicate involvement of the endocrine system (gonadotropins and testosterone) in the regulation of the testicular IL-18 family, which could be involved in the regulation of testicular functions, development and spermatogenesis under physiological conditions.",M2

17805543,"Regulatory molecules involved in inflammasome formation with special reference to a key mediator protein, ASC.The recent identification of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with leucine-rich repeats, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), has been garnering considerable attention. Activated PRRs form molecular complexes called inflammasomes, consisting of related proteins that include procaspase 1[interleukin (IL) 1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)]. Inflammasomes have been shown to facilitate molecular proximity, stimulate activation of procaspase 1, which consequently produces inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 and ultimately lead to the initiation of innate immunity. An adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), which recruits PRRs carrying the pyrin homologous domain (PYD) and procaspase 1 through PYD and CARD, respectively, is responsible for the formation of some inflammasomes and also activation of procaspase 1. In this review, our main attention will be directed to PYD region analysis of ASC to understand the interaction between PYD-carrying PRRs and ASC. Taking into consideration the other aspects of the ASC gene in the proapoptotic ability and down-regulation by methylation, the biological function of ASC will be discussed in relation to the epigenetic aspects of infection, inflammation, and cancer.",M2
17678975,"Evidence implicating matrix metalloproteinases in the mechanism underlying accumulation of IL-1beta and neuronal apoptosis in the neocortex of HIV/gp120-exposed rats.Neuroinflammation is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is one of the main mediators of inflammation, and IL-1beta expression in the brain is rapidly upregulated in response to acute and chronic insults. IL-1beta is synthesized as biologically inactive precursor (pro-IL-1beta), which is classically processed by caspase-1 [also known as interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)] into the active, mature cytokine. However, caspase-1/ICE-independent mechanisms of IL-1beta processing have recently been suggested. Here we report that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate in the maturation process (cleavage and activation) of IL-1beta in an in vivo model of HIV-associated neurodegeneration based on the intracerebroventricular injection of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. We show that, following gp120 exposure, MMP-9 and MMP-2, but not caspase-1/ICE, are rapidly induced. Pharmacological manipulation of MMPs activity, using the broad spectrum MMPs inhibitor GM6001, reduces the increase in IL-1beta immunoreactivity and the neuronal apoptosis induced by gp120. Taken together, these findings point to a critical role for MMPs in IL-1beta increase and consequent neurotoxicity triggered by gp120 in the neocortex of rat and suggest new links between IL-1beta processing and MMP activation during the neuroinflammatory process.",M2
17658666,"Expression of interleukin-18 is increased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.The inflammatory cytokines can initiate nerve cell degeneration and enhance the plaque production typically found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an inflammatory cytokine, which can induce the expression of interferon-gamma. This interleukin shares similarities with the IL-1 family of proteins. Like IL-1 beta, IL-18 is cleaved by caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>) to an active secreted form. We examined the expressions of IL-18, -1 beta and ICE in different brain regions from AD patients that were categorized with respect to the Braak stage, and age-matched with non-demented controls. The levels of total-RNA and protein of IL-18 and ICE were increased, especially in the frontal lobe of AD patients and this change was not modified by ApoE genotype. Immunohistochemistry of AD brain samples detected IL-18 in microglia, astrocytes, and surprisingly in neurons, and it is also co-localized not only with amyloid-beta plaques but also with tau. In CSF, elevated IL-18 level was detected only in men and it also correlated with CSF tau in MCI. IL-18 may thus be a potential biomarker for men. Plasma levels of IL-18 showed no correlation with the disease. In conclusion, amyloid-beta may induce the synthesis of IL-18, and IL-18 kinases involved in tau phosphorylation as a part of the amyloid-associated inflammatory reaction.",M2
17650954,"Insulin and IGF-1 mediated inhibition of apoptosis in CHO cells grown in suspension in a protein-free medium.When Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in suspension and deprived of serum, 40% of them became apoptotic after 72 hours, as determined by flow cytometry analysis of TUNEL-labelled cells. Cell viability, assessed by erythrocin B staining, decreased correspondingly. An increase in the total fraction of cells expressing interleukin converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; caspase 1), B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2,) and Bcl-2 associated x protein (Bax) was shown by antibody probing and subsequent flow cytometry. The p53 tumour suppressor gene product level remained low within the cell population. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) inhibited cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, and at 20 ng/ml, cell viability was maintained close to 100% and no apoptotic cells were detected. Also, insulin was shown to inhibit cell death - at 1.0 microg/ml, cell viability was 95%, whereas 10% of the cells stained for apoptosis. At the highest concentrations of IGF-1 and insulin, the expression of ICE, Bcl-2 and Bax was fully suppressed, whereas the p53 product level increased, despite still being detectable in a minority of cells. Under these conditions, IGF-1 may increase p53 expression to restrain abnormal cell proliferation. It is concluded that special attention should be paid to exposure and culture conditions that induce acquired susceptibility to a toxic insult, during the development and validation of cell-based assays.",M2
17572009,"The synthetic tellurium compound, AS101, is a novel inhibitor of IL-1beta converting enzyme.The organotellurium compound, trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O') tellurate (AS101) has been shown previously to exert diverse biologic activities both in vitro and in vivo. This compound was recently found to react with thiols and to catalyze their oxidation. This property of AS101 raises the possibility that it may serve as a cysteine protease inhibitor. In the present study, using a substrate-specific enzymatic assay, we show that treatment of caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta [IL-1beta] converting enzyme [<e>ICE</e>]) with AS101 inhibits its enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the results show that AS101 treatment causes a significant reduction in the active form of IL-18 and IL-1beta in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in human HaCat keratinocytes. We further demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of AS101 does not involve nitric oxide (NO) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), two possible regulators of IL-18 production, and does not occur at the mRNA level, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism of action. More importantly, AS101 downregulates IL-18 and IL-1beta serum levels in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, resulting in increased survival. Recent studies emphasize the pathophysiologic role of IL-18 and IL-1beta in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Thus, their blockage by the nontoxic compound, AS101, currently used in clinical studies, may provide clinical advantage in the treatment of these diseases.",M2
17541728,"Molecular cloning and characterization of Hearm caspase-1 from Helicoverpa armigera.Members of the caspase family play a central and evolutionary role in programmed cell death (PCD), which removes unwanted, damaged and dangerous cells during development to maintain homeostasis. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a caspase from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, named Hearm caspase-1. The 1,350 bp full-length cDNA contains an 885 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a Hearm caspase-1 proenzyme of 294 amino acids. The deduced protein is highly homologous to Spodoptera frugiperda Sf caspase-1 and Drosophila melanogaster <e>ICE</e> and has the highly conserved pentapeptide QACQG, the recognized catalytic site of caspases, suggesting that it is an effector caspase of the cotton bollworm. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that Hearm caspase-1 is expressed in embryos and the fat body, midgut and haemocytes of feeding and wandering larvae. Expression of Hearm caspase-1 in the haemocytes appears to be correlated with the pulse of ecdysone, and it is up-regulated by ecdysone agonist RH-2485, implying that Hearm caspase-1 activation is regulated by ecdysone.",M2
17473225,"Cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin converting enzyme inhibition in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of the interleukin converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) on cardiac inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and left ventricular function in an animal model of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in 24 Sprague-Dawley rats by injection of streptozotozin (STZ) (70 mg/kg). Diabetic animals were treated with the interleukin converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor (ICEI) (n = 12) or with a placebo (n = 12). Nondiabetic rats served as controls (n = 12). Left ventricular function was documented 6 weeks after induction of diabetes. Cardiac tissue was analyzed for the expression of cytokines, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, leukocyte and macrophage integrins, and collagen. Phosphorylation of Akt was analyzed by Western blot and apoptosis by Blc-2 and Bax measurements. RESULTS: Left ventricular function was significantly impaired in diabetic animals. This was accompanied by a significant increase of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, leukocytes and macrophages, and collagen content. In addition, the phosphorylation state of Akt was reduced. These changes were significantly attenuated in the diabetic group treated with ICEI. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac dysfunction is associated with cardiac inflammation in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both of these--cardiac dysfunction and inflammation--are attenuated after treatment with ICEI. These data suggest that anticytokine-based therapies might be beneficial in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",M2
17461983,"Elevated levels of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 in acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and apoptosis-specific immune activation play a major role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The role of systemic and coronary obtained inflammatory plasma protein interleukin-1beta precursor (IL-1betap), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and the apoptosis-specific caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (ccCK-18) are not known in ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from stable angina (SA, n = 34), unstable angina (UA, n = 37) and patients with AMI (n = 39). Coronary blood was acquired by means of thrombectomy devices (X-sizer) in AMI patients. IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Group comparisons were evaluated by parametric Tukey test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive values of IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 as compared to creatine kinase (CK) and troponin T (TnT) in order to relate these markers with the occurrence of myocardial damage. RESULTS: IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were identified to be significantly altered in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from AMI as compared to SA and UA. ROC curves were plotted and revealed that ccCK-18 is a novel sensitive marker for the detection of myocardial damage as compared to TnT or CK. (AUC ccCK-18 0.925, TnT AUC 0.62 and CK AUC 0.858.) Moreover, ICE and ccCK-18 were significantly increased at the site of coronary occlusion as compared to peripheral blood samples in AMI patients (both P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ACS is related to increased concentration of systemic soluble ICE and ccCK-18. Moreover, soluble ccCK-18 was identified to be a superior marker as compared to TnT or CK, for detection of myocardial damage.",M2
17393315,"The <e>ICE</e> inhibitor pralnacasan prevents DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice and suppresses IP-10 mRNA but not TNF-alpha mRNA expression.Previously we demonstrated an ameliorating effect of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor pralnacasan on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. This study investigates the effects of pralnacasan on cytokine expression in DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was induced by oral administration of DSS. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with the ICE inhibitor pralnacasan (50 mg/kg body weight twice daily). Body weight as well as the presence of occult blood or diarrhea was monitored daily. Subgroups were sacrificed at days 4, 8, and 11 after the beginning of DSS application. Cytokine profiles in colonic tissue were analyzed on the protein level by ELISA and on the mRNA level by real time RT-PCR. Administration of DSS led to an increase in IL-18, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma protein as well as IP-10 and TNF-alpha mRNA. The increase in IL-18 and IFN-gamma was reduced by ICE inhibition. Pralnacasan prevented DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. In C57BL/6 mice, the DSS-induced increase in IP-10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA, was completely prevented by ICE inhibition. In conclusion, prevention of colitis in C57BL/6 mice was associated with a suppresion of IP-10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA expression, indicating that IL-18-mediated cytokine production is a key element in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis.",M2
17292624,"A novel role of interleukin-1-converting enzyme in cytokine-mediated inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression: Implications for neuroinflammatory diseases.Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-derived NO plays an important role in several neurological disorders. Understanding of mechanisms involved in the regulation of iNOS induction is of particular interest. Here, we investigated mechanisms of iNOS induction in rat astrocytes (AC) and in brain endothelial cells (BEC). We find that activation of AC or BEC with pro-inflammatory cytokines reveals a different cell-specific activation pattern for iNOS expression. Despite these differences, in both cell types iNOS expression and activity exclusively depends on the endogenous availability of bioactive IL-1beta as inhibition of <e>ICE</e> activity significantly decreases iNOS promoter activity, iNOS expression and enzyme activity. In summary, we here provide evidence that ICE represents a target for modulating iNOS expression and high-output NO formation in AC and BEC, to our knowledge the first report of a role of ICE in iNOS expression and the advantage of ICE inhibition in attenuating NO mediated inflammation and pathology.",M2
17278232,"Therapeutic effects of caspase-1 inhibitors on acute lung injury in experimental severe acute pancreatitis.AIM: To assess the therapeutic effect of Caspase-1 inhibitors (<e>ICE</e>-I) on acute lung injury (ALI) in experimental severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Forty-two SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: healthy controls (HC, n = 6); SAP-S group (n = 18); SAP-ICE-I group (n = 18). SAP was induced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate into the bile-pancreatic duct. HC rats underwent the same surgical procedures and duct cannulation without sodium taurocholate infusion. In SAP-S group, rats received the first intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline 2 h after induction of acute pancreatitis and a repeated injection after 12 h. In SAP-ICE-I group, the rats were firstly given ICE inhibitors intraperitoneally 2 h after induction of pancreatitis. As in SAP-S group, the injection was repeated at 12 h. Serum IL-1beta was measured by ELISA. Intrapulmonary expression of Caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The wet/dry weight ratios and histopathological changes of the lungs were also evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IL-1beta levels in SAP-S group were 276.77 +/- 44.92 pg/mL at 6 h, 308.99 +/- 34.95 pg/mL at 12 h, and 311.60 +/- 46.51 pg/mL at 18 h, which were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01, vs HC). In SAP-ICE-I group, those values were decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01, vs SAP-S). Intrapulmonary expression of Caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were observed in the HC group, while they were increased significantly in the SAP-S group (P &lt; 0.01, vs HC). The expression of IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were decreased significantly in the SAP-ICE-I group (P &lt; 0.01, vs SAP-S), whereas Caspase-1 mRNA expression had no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The wet/dry weight ratios of the lungs in the SAP-S group were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05 at 6 h, P &lt; 0.01 at 12 h and 18 h, vs HC) and they were decreased significantly in the SAP-ICE-I group (P &lt; 0.05, vs SAP-S). Caspase-1 inhibitors ameliorated the severity of ALI in SAP. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1 activation, and overproduction of IL-1beta and IL-18 play an important role in the course of ALI, and Caspase-1 inhibition is effective for the treatment of ALI in experimental SAP.",M2
17215863,"Interleukin-1 superfamily genes expression in normal or impaired human spermatogenesis.Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that may play a role in contributing to the specific immune environment of mammalian testis and in regulating cell differentiation. We have determined the transcription activity of the IL-1 gene family (using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in two main functional testicular compartments (interstitial and intratubular ones), and in tissue homogenates obtained from patients with fertility disorders (spermatogenic arrest and testicular tumors). We observed the prominent expression of gene coding for IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) in a purified fraction of gametogenic cells (normal gonad). Caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e> - IL-1beta-converting enzyme) was highly expressed (on mRNA level) in interstitial compartments as well in testicular tumors (immune enhancement?). In addition we found, that the activity of IL-1RA gene decreased along spermatogenic alteration in an inversely related manner with IL-1alpha (from normal gonad through spermatogenic arrest to Sertoli cell only syndrome). Therefore, the quotient value of IL-1alpha/IL-1RA could potentially serve as the diagnostic molecular probe for spermatogenesis assessment. The precise level of mRNA for IL-1-IL-18 cytokines and their receptors, and specifically of the receptor antagonist in immune privileged gonad, could be one of the main factors responsible for maintaining testicular homeostasis, thus enabling generation of the mature spermatozoa.",M2
17138058,"sCD30, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentrations in heart transplant recipients.sCD30 and <e>ICE</e>/caspase-1 as apoptosis-regulating factors are suspected to be involved in the survival rate of immunocompetent cells during immunosuppression after allotransplantation. Serum CD30 and ICE/caspase-1 concentrations were estimated and associated with unspecific serum apoptosis marker--anti-Annexin V antibodies and myocardial biopsies results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 28 clinically stabile patients--heart transplant recipients at least 3 months after cardiac transplantation performed due to heart failure caused by ischaemic and/or congestive cardiomyopathy or/and primary valvular heart disease (26 men and 2 women, mean age=36.8 years, S.D.=7.6) with normal heart function assessed by use of ultrasound scan--were involved in the trial. The patients were divided and analyzed in two ways: first according to the results of elective endomyocardial biopsies and second to main immunosuppressive agent used. The enzyme immunoassay (CD30, Dako; interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/Caspase-1 ELISA and anti-Annexin V BENDER MedSystem) for soluble CD30, caspase-1 and anti-Annexin V autoantibodies serum levels was used. RESULTS: sCD30 and caspase-1 concentrations were non-significantly up-regulated in all analysed groups--with or without rejection signs or immunosuppressed with cyclosporine or especially tacrolimus. In contrast anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentration was non-significantly down-regulated also in all studied groups. Moreover in the group with signs of transplant rejection, strong negative correlation between anti-Annexin antibodies and rejection grade was observed (-0.65, p&lt;0.05). Biopsy results were comparable in groups treated with tacrolimus and cyclosporine A. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing tendency of sCD30 and caspase-1 as well as the decrease in anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentrations in heart recipients could be the result of post-transplant apoptosis disturbances. This tendency seems to be inhibited in a greater degree by tacrolimus than by cyclosporine. Anti-Annexin V autoantibodies might be considered as negative rejection markers due to their strong negative correlation with the rejection grade.",M2

This strategy proved to be effective for the synthesis of ICE inhibitors, maintaining key hydrogen bond interactions with the enzyme and invoking a preferred conformation for binding. Several compounds exhibited IC(50) values less than 10nM in a caspase-1 enzyme assay and less than 100nM in a THP-1 whole cell assay measuring IL-1beta production.

17107775,"Developmental and hormonal regulation of midgut remodeling in a lepidopteran insect, Heliothis virescens.Midgut tissue undergoes remodeling during metamorphosis in insects belonging to orders Lepidoptera and Diptera. We investigated the developmental and hormonal regulation of these remodeling events in lepidopteran insect, Heliothis virescens. In H. virescens, programmed cell death (PCD) of larval midgut cells as well as proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells began at 108 h after ecdysis to the final larval instar (AEFL) and proceeded through the pupal stages. Expression patterns of pro- cell death factors (caspase-1 and <e>ICE</e>) and anti-cell death factor, Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) were studied in midguts during last larval and pupal stages. IAP, Caspase-1 and ICE mRNAs showed peaks at 48 h AEFL, 96 h AEFL and in newly formed pupae, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis substantiated high caspase-3 activity in midgut at 108 h AEFL. Application of methoprene, a juvenile hormone analog (JHA) blocked PCD by maintaining high levels of IAP, downregulating the expression of caspase-1, ICE and inhibiting an increase in caspase-3 protein levels in midgut tissue. Also, the differentiation of imaginal cells was impaired by methoprene treatment. These studies demonstrate that presence of JHA during final instar larvae affects both midgut remodeling and larval-pupal metamorphosis leading to larval/pupal deformities in lepidopteran insects, a mechanism that is different from that in mosquito, Ae. aegypti where JHA uncouples midgut remodeling from metamorphosis.",M2
17020759,"Oxidized ATP decreases beta-actin expression and intracellular superoxide concentrations in RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes independently of P2X7 receptor.Periodate-oxidized 2',3'-dialdehyde ATP (oxidized ATP) has been used extensively as a selective antagonist at P2X(7) receptors, although P2X(7)-independent actions on pro-inflammatory cytokine release have also been reported. Because P2X(7) receptors in astrocytes have been suggested as potential targets of anti-inflammatory drug therapy, we examined the effect of oxidized ATP on beta-actin expression and superoxide production of RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes known to possess P2X(7) receptors. Oxidized ATP per se decreased beta-actin expression time and dose dependently. Treatment with oxidized ATP for 8 h caused an approximately 50% decrease in beta-actin expression whereas other P2 receptor antagonists, brilliant blue G (BBG), suramin and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), were not effective. In addition, oxidized ATP per se decreased the intracellular superoxide concentration, whereas ATP and the P2X(7) receptor-selective agonist 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) stimulated intracellular superoxide production, an effect inhibited by oxidized ATP. In addition, oxidized ATP neither affected cellular viability nor affected interleukin-1beta, converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)-like protease activity in these astrocytes. To further elucidate the mechanism, the effects of oxidized ATP on intracellular superoxide concentration and beta-actin expression were examined in a P2X(7) receptor-negative astrocyte cell line, IA-1g1. Oxidized ATP-induced a time-dependent decrease in intracellular superoxide concentration whereas oxidized ATP had no effect on beta-actin expression. Nevertheless, oxidized ATP altered f-actin cytoskeleton arrangement in IA-1g1 astrocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that oxidized ATP per se caused a cell specific decrease in beta-actin expression in RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes. In addition, oxidized ATP decreased intracellular superoxide concentrations and altered f-actin cytoskeleton arrangement in both P2X(7) receptor-positive and -negative astrocytes. Thus, we conclude from these results that the effects of oxidized ATP on actin and superoxide are mediated through mechanisms that are at least in part, independent of P2X(7) receptors.",M2

16886979,"Inactivation of caspase-1 in rodent brain: a novel anticonvulsive strategy.PURPOSE: Cytokines and related inflammatory mediators are rapidly synthesized in the brain during seizures. We previously found that intracerebral administration of interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta has proconvulsant effects, whereas its endogenous receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) mediates potent anticonvulsant actions in various models of limbic seizures. In this study, we investigated whether seizures can be effectively inhibited by blocking the brain production of IL-1beta, by using selective inhibitors of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>/caspase-1) or through caspase-1 gene deletion. METHODS: Caspase-1 was selectively blocked by using pralnacasan or VX-765. IL-1beta release was induced in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures by proinflammatory stimuli [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + adenosine triphosphate (ATP)] and measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL-1beta production during seizures was measured in the rat hippocampus by Western blot. Seizures were induced in freely moving mice and rats by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and recorded by EEG analysis. RESULTS: Caspase-1 inhibition reduced the release of IL-1beta in organotypic slices exposed to LPS+ATP. Administration of pralnacasan (intracerebroventricular, 50 microg) or VX-765 (intraperitoneal, 25-200 mg/kg) to rats blocked seizure-induced production of IL-1beta in the hippocampus, and resulted in a twofold delay in seizure onset and 50% reduction in seizure duration. Mice with caspase-1 gene deletion showed a 70% reduction in seizures and an approximate fourfold delay in their onset. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of caspase-1 represents an effective and novel anticonvulsive strategy, which acts by selectively reducing the brain availability of IL-1beta.",M2

METHODS: Rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model was developed by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and bilateral common carotid arteries (CCAs) 1 h after reperfusion. Using flow cytometry (FCM) and Northern blot hybridization, we calculated the number of apoptotic bodies and detected the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) mRNA. RESULTS: The apoptotic bodies in hippocampus analyzed by FCM peaked at appeared 24 h after reperfusion, and decreased about 54% and 40%, respectively, after treatment with isoflurane and sevoflurane, as compared with ischemic group. There was no significant difference in the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and ICE mRNA between the inhaled anesthetic groups and ischemic group in hippocampus 24 h after MCA/CCAs occlusion.

16817903,"Involvement of caspase 1 and its activator Ipaf upstream of mitochondrial events in apoptosis.PTP-S2/TC45 is a nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates p53 and induces caspase 1-dependent apoptosis. We analyzed the role of <e>ICE</e> protease-activating factor (Ipaf), an activator of caspase 1 in p53-dependent apoptosis. We also determined the sequence of events that lead to apoptosis upon caspase 1 activation by Ipaf. PTP-S2 expression induced Ipaf mRNA in MCF-7 cells which was dependent on p53. PTP-S2-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of Ipaf and also by an Ipaf-directed short-hairpin RNA. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was potentiated by the expression of caspase 1 (but not by a catalytic mutant of caspase 1) and required endogenous Ipaf. Doxorubicin treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in activation of exogenous caspase 1, which was partly dependent on endogenous Ipaf. An activated form of Ipaf induced caspase 1-dependent apoptosis that was inhibited by Bcl2 and also by a dominant inhibitor of caspase 9 (caspase 9s). Caspase 1-dependent apoptosis induced by doxorubicin was also inhibited by Bcl2 and caspase 9s, but caspase 1 activation by activated Ipaf was not inhibited by Bcl2. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was induced by caspase 1 and activated Ipaf, which was inhibited by Bcl2, but not by caspase 9s. Expression of caspase 1 with activated Ipaf resulted in the activation of Bax at mitochondria. Our results suggest that Ipaf is involved in PTP-S2-induced apoptosis and that caspase 1, when activated by Ipaf, causes release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c and Omi) through Bax activation, thereby functioning as an initiator caspase.",M2

These protein preparations are expensive to manufacture and administer, need to be injected and can cause allergic reactions. An alternative approach to lowering the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in inflammatory disease, is to inhibit the enzymes that generate these cytokines using cheaper small molecules. This paper is a broad overview of the progress that has been achieved so far, with respect to small molecule inhibitor design and pharmacological studies (in animals and humans), for the metalloprotease Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha Converting Enzyme (TACE) and the cysteine protease Caspase-1 (Interleukin-1beta Converting Enzyme, <e>ICE</e>).

16283677,"Small molecular anti-cytokine agents.The recent successful introduction of the anti-cytokine biologicals Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Anakinra has stimulated the search for anti-cytokine small-molecules. A number of molecular targets have been identified for the development of such small molecular anti-cytokine agents. The focus of this review will be on those inhibitors of cytokine production, which target either p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), or IL-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). P38 MAP kinase occupies a central role in the signaling network responsible for the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha, and regulates their biosynthesis at both the transcriptional and translational level. TACE and ICE are two proteases required for the processing of proTNF-alpha and proIL-1beta, respectively into their mature, proinflammatory form. Since the mid-1990s, a plethora of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, TACE, and ICE has been characterized in vitro, and individual representatives from all three inhibitor classes have in the meantime been advanced into clinical trials. This review will highlight the correlation between effective inhibition at the molecular target and cellular activity in functional assays of cytokine, particularly TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, production. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) will be discussed regarding activity at the respective enzyme target, but also with regard to properties required for efficient in vitro and in vivo cellular activity (e.g., oral availability, solubility, cell penetration, etc.).",M2

METHODS: Mouse models of ischemic ARF were treated with the specific ICE inhibitor AC-YVAD-CMK. A renal function assay and renal morphological studies were employed to estimate the renal protective effect of AC-YVAD-CMK. The survival rate of mouse models was also analyzed by a time series test. Furthermore, renal ICE activity, mature interleukin-18 (IL-18) protein expression and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA expression were also detected by fluorescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISA, and semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) increased remarkably in the model controls compared with the sham-operated groups (P&lt;0.01). Typical renal tubular necrosis was found in the model controls. Renal ICE activity, mature IL-18 protein expression, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were also increased significantly in the model controls compared with the sham-operated groups. The levels of BUN and Scr in the AC-YVAD-CMK therapy group were decreased significantly compared with the untreated model controls (P&lt;0.01). Renal tubulointerstitial lesion was also attenuated significantly (P&lt;0.05). AC-YVAD-CMK therapy alleviated the clinical features of ARF, and increased the survival rate (P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, AC-YVAD-CMK therapy also decreased ICE activity, mature IL-18 protein expression, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in renal tissue (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The selective ICE inhibitor AC-YVAD-CMK can effectively protect the kidney from acute ischemic lesions. This protective effect is associated with decreased renal ICE activity and suppressed IL-18 maturation and IFN-gamma mRNA transcription.",M2

16201101,"The concentration of sFasL, <e>ICE</e> and IL-1beta in the serum and the liver tissue of chronic HCV infected patients.BACKGROUND/AIMS: In HCV infected patients HCV, apoptosis is as important as cytotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to estimate the activity of apoptosis in patients infected with hepatitis C before and during antiviral treatment. METHODOLOGY: 23 patients with hepatitis C were treated with Rebetron for 12 months. The concentration of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL in the serum and liver tissue was analyzed before treatment was begun. The concentrations of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment were also analyzed. The concentrations of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL in the liver tissue of patients with hepatitis C were compared with the concentrations in liver tissue of patients with alcohol related liver damage, but not HBV or HCV infected. RESULTS: Only 35% of the patients eliminated HCV-RNA from the blood six months after treatment had ended. The concentration of ICE and IL-1beta in the liver tissue of patients with hepatitis C was compared to concentrations in the liver tissue of patients with alcohol related liver damage. The concentration of sFasL in the liver tissue was twice as high among patients with alcohol related liver damage in comparison to the patients with infected hepatitis C. In the control group sFasL and ICE were not confirmed in the serum. After antiviral therapy the number of patients with sFas ligand in the blood increased (before beginning treatment 1 patient, after 12 weeks 8 patients). The high concentrations of ICE and IL-1beta in the serum showed a tendency to decrease during 12 weeks of therapy in the successfully treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The HCV seems to be a mild stimulator of apoptosis. There was only a slight correlation between the morphology changes in the liver tissue and apoptosis in patients with HCV. There was no correlation between the success of the therapy and the apoptosis activity.",M2
16106098,"Release of IL-1beta via IL-1beta-converting enzyme in a skin dendritic cell line exposed to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene.We used a mouse fetal skin dendritic cell line (FSDC) to study the effect of the strong allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) on interleukin (IL)-1beta release and IL-1beta receptor immunoreactivity. Stimulation with DNFB (30 minutes) increased IL-1 release without changing the mRNA levels of the protein. Furthermore, DNFB increased transiently the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) activity, as measured with its fluorogenic substrate Z-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-AFC. The ICE inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK prevented the release of IL-1beta evoked by DNFB. Incubation of the cells with DNFB (30 minutes) strongly increased IL-1beta receptor immunoreactivity. The rapid effect of DNFB on the release of mature IL-1beta, without inducing an increase of IL-1beta mRNA in FSDC, suggests a posttranslational modification of pro-IL-1beta by ICE activity.",M2
16103071,"Caspase-1 is a direct target gene of ETS1 and plays a role in ETS1-induced apoptosis.ETS1, the founding member of Ets transcriptional factor family, plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, lymphoid cell development, transformation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Previous work has shown that ETS1 represses tumorigenicity of colon carcinoma cells in vivo, and that the p42-ETS1 protein bypasses a defect in apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells through the up-regulation of caspase-1 expression. In this report, we show that expression of p42-ETS1 inhibits tumorigenicity of colon cancer DLD-1 cells through induction of apoptosis in vivo. In support of the hypothesis that caspase-1 might be a target involved in the sensitization of DLD-1 cells to Fas-induced apoptosis by ETS1, overexpression of caspase-1 bypasses Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells as well. Furthermore, ETS1-mediated apoptosis was observed in MOP8 cells, a transformed mouse NIH3T3 cell line. To determine whether ETS1 activates the transcription of caspase-1, luciferase reporters driven by the wild-type and mutant caspase-1 promoters were generated. Both p51-ETS1 and p42-ETS1 transactivated the caspase-1 transcription and a functional Ets binding site is identified in the caspase-1 promoter. Wild-type caspase-1 promoter (pGL3-<e>ICE</e>) was strongly transactivated by ETS1 and this transactivation was dramatically diminished by the mutation of the potential Ets binding site (-525 bp). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed complex formation between this binding site and ETS1 proteins. Taken together, ETS1 transcriptionally induces the expression of caspase-1; as such, the regulatory control of caspase-1 expression by ETS1 may underlie the apoptotic susceptibility modulated by ETS1 in specific tumor cells.",M2

15858021,"The Nef-mediated AIDS-like disease of CD4C/human immunodeficiency virus transgenic mice is associated with increased Fas/FasL expression on T cells and T-cell death but is not prevented in Fas-, FasL-, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-, or interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-deficient or Bcl2-expressing transgenic mice.CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-T-cell death is a frequent immunological dysfunction associated with the development of human AIDS. We studied a murine model of AIDS, the CD4C/HIV transgenic (Tg) mouse model, to assess the importance of the apoptotic pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis. In these Tg mice, Nef is the major determinant of the disease and is expressed in immature and mature CD4(+) T cells and in cells of the macrophage/myeloid lineage. We report here a novel AIDS-like phenotype: enhanced death, most likely by apoptosis (as assessed by 7-aminoactinomycin D and annexin V/propidium iodide staining), of Tg thymic and peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also more susceptible to cell death after activation in vitro in mixed lymph node (LN) cultures. However, activation-induced cell death was not higher in Tg than in non-Tg-purified CD4(+) T cells. In addition, expression of Fas and FasL, assessed by flow cytometry, was increased in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from Tg mice compared to that of non-Tg littermates. Despite the enhanced expression of Fas and FasL on Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Fas (lpr/lpr) and FasL (gld/gld) mutant CD4C/HIV Tg mice developed an AIDS-like disease indistinguishable from lpr/+ and gld/+ CD4C/HIV Tg mice, including loss of CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, CD4C/HIV Tg mice homozygous for mutations of two other genes implicated in cell death (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme [<e>ICE</e>], tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR-1]) developed similar AIDS-like disease as their respective heterozygous controls. Moreover, the double-Tg mice from a cross between the Bcl2/Wehi25 and CD4C/HIV Tg mice showed no major protection against disease. These results represent genetic evidence for the dispensable role of Fas, FasL, ICE, and TNFR-1 on the development of both T-cell loss and organ disease of these Tg mice. They also provide compelling evidence on the lack of protection by Bcl2 against Tg CD4(+)-T-cell death. In view of the high resemblance between numerous phenotypes observed in the CD4C/HIV Tg mice and in human AIDS, our findings are likely to be relevant for the human disease.",M2
15845887,"Proapoptotic effects of caspase-1/interleukin-converting enzyme dominate in myocardial ischemia.Caspase-1/interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) is a cysteine protease traditionally considered to have importance as an inflammatory mediator, but not as an apoptotic effector. Because of the dual functions of this caspase, the pathophysiological impact of its reported upregulation in hypertrophy and heart failure is not known. Here, the consequences of increased myocardial expression of procaspase-1 were examined on the normal and ischemically injured heart. In unstressed mouse hearts with a 30-fold increase in procaspase-1 content, unprocessed procaspase-1 was well tolerated, without detectable pathology. Cardiomyocyte processing and activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 occurred after administration of endotoxin or with transient myocardial ischemia. In post-ischemic hearts, procaspase-1 overexpression was associated with strikingly increased cardiac myocyte apoptosis in the peri- and noninfarct regions and with 50% larger myocardial infarctions. Tissue culture studies revealed that procaspase-1 processing/activation is stimulated by hypoxia, and that caspase-1 acts in synergy with hypoxia to stimulate caspase-3 mediated apoptosis without activating upstream caspases. These data demonstrate that the proapoptotic effects of caspase-1 can significantly impact the myocardial response to ischemia and suggest that conditions in which procaspase-1 in the heart is increased may predispose to apoptotic myocardial injury under conditions of physiological stress.",M2
15590467,"Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection in IL-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, caspase-1) deficient mice.PURPOSE: Antibody neutralization studies have shown that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection, IL-1 beta is critical to regulation of the host inflammatory response, but mechanisms remain undetermined. To elucidate these mechanisms, caspase-1 knockout (ICE(-/-)) mice, that do not release mature IL-1 beta after endotoxin challenge, were tested. METHODS: Clinical scores, MPO activity (for PMN quantitation), bacterial plate count, semiquantitative RT-PCR, ELISA and TUNEL staining were used to characterize the inflammatory response after infection in knockout and C57BL/6 (B6) wild type mice. RESULTS: Clinical scores were significantly reduced in ICE(-/-) vs. B6 mice at 3, 5 and 7 days postinfection (p.i.). The decreased inflammatory response of ICE(-/-) mice was striking at 1 day p.i., and bacterial load also was significantly reduced in the cornea of the knockout mice at 3-7 days p.i. Knockout mice exhibited significantly increased mRNA and protein levels for IL-1Ra, the physiological regulator of IL-1 activity, and in addition, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells were quantitated in the corneal epithelium of ICE(-/-) vs. B6 mice at 1 day p.i. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that bacterial infection in the cornea of ICE(-/-) mice induces a reduced inflammatory response by: reduction in PMN and cytokines and chemokines that attract these cells to the cornea; enhanced apoptotic cell death in the infected epithelium; and increased IL-1Ra levels. The data also confirm the importance of IL-1 regulation in this model and suggest that ICE inhibition may be an attractive ancillary therapeutic strategy to control the host response to this pathogen.",M2
15517889,"Immunotherapy by gene transfer with plasmids encoding IL-12/IL-18 is superior to IL-23/IL-18 gene transfer in a rat osteosarcoma model.BACKGROUND: Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumors of bone or soft parts arising from bone-forming mesenchymal cells. Despite dramatic therapeutic advances, namely neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, progress is at a plateau. Cytokine-mediated gene therapy might represent a further advance in the therapy of the osteosarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We transfected UMR 108 osteosarcoma cells with different plasmids encoding IL-12, IL-23, proIL-18 and <e>ICE</e> (Interleukin-converting enzyme). IFN-gamma induction, which is known to induce antitumor effects mediated by the immune system, and cytotoxic effects of various cytokine combination were investigated. RESULTS: Our results show that local secretion of IL-12 by UMR 108 cells led to an induction of cytotoxic effects mediated by mononuclear cells, which were enhanced by additional administration of recombinant IL-18. In contrast to IL-18, IL-23 showed a moderate increase of IFN-gamma induction when transfected alone and could only slightly increase the IFN-gamma induction mediated by IL-12. IL-18 enhanced IFN-gamma induction when applied alone and was able to increase the IFN-gamma production that was induced by IL-12. CONCLUSION: IL-23 seems to be a less effective immuno-therapeutic for adjuvant treatment of osteosarcomas than IL-12 and IL-18, when taking only IFN-gamma induction into consideration.",M2
15383541,"INCA, a novel human caspase recruitment domain protein that inhibits interleukin-1beta generation.Using in silico methods for screening the human genome for new caspase recruitment domain (CARD) proteins, we have identified INCA (Inhibitory CARD) as a protein that shares 81% identity with the prodomain of caspase-1. The INCA gene is located on chromosome 11q22 between the genes of COP/Pseudo-<e>ICE</e> and ICEBERG, two other CARD proteins that arose from caspase-1 gene duplications. We show that INCA mRNA is expressed in many tissues. INCA is specifically upregulated by interferon-gamma in the monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937. INCA physically interacts with procaspase-1 and blocks the release of mature IL-1beta from LPS-stimulated macrophages. Unlike COP/Pseudo-ICE and procaspase-1, INCA does not interact with RIP2 and does not induce NF-kappaB activation. Our data show that INCA is a novel intracellular regulator of procaspase-1 activation, involved in the regulation of pro-IL-1beta processing and its release during inflammation.",M2

METHODS: Clinical score, histopathology, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, bacterial counts, and ELISA analysis were used to assess the efficacy of treatment initiated at 18 hours postinfection (p.i.) with ICE inhibitor versus placebo; and with ICE inhibitor plus ciprofloxacin versus placebo plus ciprofloxacin. Efficacy of the ICE inhibitor was also tested and evaluated for clinical score in experimental corneal infection induced by a clinical isolate and a ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial strain. RESULTS: Clinical scores were reduced at 3, 5, and 7 days p.i. in ICE inhibitor versus placebo-treated mice; reduced scores also were observed with a combined treatment (ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin). Further testing (MPO assay) revealed reduced PMN number, particularly striking in ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin versus placebo and ciprofloxacin-treated mice. Corneal protein levels for IL-1beta and MIP-2 also were reduced in mice treated with the ICE inhibitor versus placebo and in ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin and placebo-treated mice. Treatment with ICE inhibitor also reduced clinical scores after corneal infection with a clinical isolate, KEI-1025, and with a ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa strain. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of IL-1beta by ICE together with ciprofloxacin to kill bacteria may provide alternate therapy to current treatment.",M2
15306164,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, but not caspase-1, prevents apoptosis and improves spatial memory of rats with twice-repeated cerebral ischemia.The effect of inhibition of PARP [(poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase], caspase-3 and caspase-1 on twice-repeated ischemia-induced apoptosis and memory impairment were examined. The twice repeated ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion method in which a 10 min ischemic episode was repeated once after 60 min. The spatial memory was assessed using 8-arm radial maze. The results of this study showed that the repeated ischemia impaired memory and induced apoptosis in hippocampus CA1 field after 7 days. Moreover, 3-aminobezamide (10 mg/kg i.v.), a PARP inhibitor, and Ac-DEVD-CHO (8.4 microg/5 microL i.c.v., bilaterally), a caspase-3 inhibitor, decreased apoptosis by 45% and 58% respectively. Both drugs reduced the error choices, but 3-aminobezamide additionally increased the correct choices and improved the memory when either drug was injected immediately after the ischemic insult. The results also showed that inhibition of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, <e>ICE</e> (caspase-1) by Z-ASP-DCB-CH2 (100 microg/kg i.c.v., bilaterally) neither decreased apoptosis (13% reduction) nor improved memory of the ischemic rats.

15140398,"A novel method for imaging apoptosis using a caspase-1 near-infrared fluorescent probe.Here we describe a novel method for imaging apoptosis in cells using a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe selective for caspase-1 (interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme, <e>ICE</e>). This biocompatible, optically quenched ICE-NIRF probe incorporates a peptide substrate, which can be selectively cleaved by caspase-1, resulting in the release of fluorescence signal. The specificity of this probe for caspase-1 is supported by various lines of evidence: 1) activation by purified caspase-1, but not another caspase in vitro; 2) activation of the probe by infection of cells with a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector (HGC-ICE-lacZ) expressing a catalytically active caspase-1-lacZ fusion protein; 3) inhibition of HGC-ICE-lacZ vector-induced activation of the probe by coincubation with the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD-cmk, but not with a caspase-3 inhibitor; and 4) activation of the probe following standard methods of inducing apoptosis with staurosporine, ganciclovir, or ionizing radiation in culture. These results indicate that this novel ICE-NIRF probe can be used in monitoring endogenous and vector-expressed caspase-1 activity in cells. Furthermore, tumor implant experiments indicate that this ICE-NIRF probe can be used to detect caspase-1 activity in living animals. This novel ICE-NIRF probe should prove useful in monitoring endogenous and vector-expressed caspase-1 activity, and potentially apoptosis in cell culture and in vivo.",M2
15067075,"Janus kinase 3 down-regulates lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1 beta-converting enzyme activation by autocrine IL-10.ProIL-1 beta processing by IL-1 beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and the subsequent release of mature IL-1 beta are highly regulated events in the monocyte/macrophage response to pathogens. This process occurs in a controlled way through the activation of the constitutively expressed 45-kDa ICE precursor (proICE). To characterize the signaling pathways involved in ICE regulation in human monocytes/macrophages, we analyzed ICE activation in the presence of specific inhibitors of classic signaling pathways. Although LPS-induced ICE activity was not significantly affected by interruption of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 kinase, or phosphoinositol 3-kinase, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibition produced a significant dose-dependent enhancement of LPS-induced ICE activity. Support for the inhibitory role of JAK3 was shown by the fact that IL-4 (which uses JAK1 and JAK3 signaling) suppressed LPS-induced ICE activity and by the finding that JAK3 knockout macrophages have increased LPS-induced ICE activation. To understand how JAK3 down-regulates LPS-induced ICE activity in monocytes, we hypothesized that JAK3 signaling enhances IL-10 production. In support of this model we show that LPS-induced IL-10 expression was synchronous with ICE deactivation, IL-4 induced the release of IL-10, exogenous IL-10 suppressed LPS-induced ICE activity, a neutralizing IL-10 Ab increased LPS-induced ICE activity, and, finally, JAK3 knockout macrophages displayed significantly reduced LPS-induced IL-10 production. These findings support a model in which JAK3 signaling enhances IL-10 production leading to down-regulation of ICE activation and suppression of IL-1 beta processing and release.",M2
15031635,"Gold sodium thiomalate and chloroquine inhibit cytokine production in monocytic THP-1 cells through distinct transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms.Gold sodium thiomalate (GST), chloroquine (CQ), and methotrexate have been widely used in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Using the human monocytic cell line THP-1 we have analyzed effects of these drugs on cytokine production and intracellular signaling. GST and CQ were equally effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1 beta release while CQ was a more effective inhibitor of TNF-alpha production than GST. Methotrexate did not affect production of these cytokines. CQ reduced IL-1 beta mRNA expression and strongly inhibited phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, and to a lesser extent c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In contrast, GST did not affect cytokine mRNA expression or MAPK activation. However, GST selectively inhibited the activity of the interleukin-1 converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1. These data demonstrate that CQ inhibits IL-1 beta release from monocytes by interfering with pretranscriptional signaling and TNF-alpha release by posttranslational events whereas GST downregulates IL-1 beta secretion by interfering with posttranslational IL-1 beta processing.",M2

15010463,"Anthrax lethal toxin rapidly activates caspase-1/<e>ICE</e> and induces extracellular release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18.Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor for Bacillus anthracis, has been demonstrated to cleave and to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) that propagate prosurvival signals in macrophages (1-5). Whether this action of anthrax LT leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages has been more controversial (6, 7). We now report that anthrax LT treatment leads to the specific extracellular release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 by the murine macrophage cell lines, RAW264.7 and J774A.1. Studies of the processing of IL-1beta reveal that the levels of activated/cleaved IL-1beta in RAW264.7 and J774.A1 cells are increased following treatment with anthrax LT. Enhanced processing of IL-1beta directly correlates with increased levels in the activation of its upstream regulator, IL-1beta-converting enzyme/Caspase-1 (ICE). The extracellular release of IL-1beta and IL-18 in response to anthrax LT is ICE-dependent, as an ICE-specific inhibitor blocks this process. These data indicate that ICE, IL-1beta, and IL-18 are downstream effectors of anthrax LT in macrophages, providing the basis for new bioassays for anthrax LT activity and representing potential therapeutic targets.",M2

14734619,"Roles of caspase-1 in Listeria infection in mice.Caspase-1 [IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)] processes substrate precursor molecules to yield the biologically active form of IL-1beta and IL-18, both of which are considered to play important roles in the host defense by activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. We evaluated the immune response of caspase-1(-/-) mice to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection. LM eradication in the early phase of infection was impaired in the mutant mice with a prominent decrease in IL-18 and IFN-gamma production, but not in IL-12. Caspase-1(-/-) spleen cells including dendritic cells and NK cells produced less IFN-gamma in response to heat-killed LM than wild-type cells in vitro. IFN-gamma production and bactericidal activity in LM-infected caspase-1(-/-) mice was reconstituted to normal levels by adding back IL-18 at the initial phase of infection, suggesting that the lack of this cytokine is primarily responsible for the susceptibility of caspase-1(-/-) mice against LM infection. Moreover, IFN-gamma injection of caspase-1(-/-) mice corrected the deficiency in pathogen clearance. In contrast, LM-specific acquired immunity in caspase-1(-/-) mice was normal and they successfully cleared the pathogen following secondary infection, in spite of a moderate skewing of cytokine profile to T(h)2 when compared to wild-type mice. These data shed light on the importance of caspase-1-mediated IL-18 processing in innate immunity against facultative intracellular pathogens.",M2

DESIGN: 80 consecutive patients with stable (n = 40) or unstable (n = 40) angina pectoris were studied. Serum concentrations of soluble CD95 (sCD95), soluble CD95 ligand (sCD95L; CD178), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, soluble TNFalpha receptor type 1 (sTNFR1), and interleukin 1beta converting enzyme (ICE; caspase 1) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Significant increases in the concentrations of sCD95 and ICE (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.023, respectively) were found in the serum from patients with unstable angina relative to those with stable angina. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of sCD95L, TNF alpha, and sTNFR1 between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first evidence that sCD95 and ICE are important serological markers that may help to discriminate between stable and unstable angina. This observation may warrant further clinical study to elucidate the clinical impact of sCD95 and ICE in acute coronary syndromes.",M2

Since both cytokines are constitutively expressed in the brain, we investigated whether this is also the case for caspase-1. Using an antibody raised against the p10-subunit of the active enzyme, constitutive expression of caspase-1 immunoreactivity was found in nerve cells in the arcuate nucleus and in nerve fibres throughout the brain.

The distribution pattern of caspase-1 immunoreactive structures is consistent with a role to produce mature IL-1beta in regions where IL-1beta mediates fever and sleep.",M2
14673996,"Gene deletion of either interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase, or stromelysin 1 accelerates the development of knee osteoarthritis in mice after surgical transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the development of osteoarthritis (OA) after transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy in mice in which genes encoding either interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), stromelysin 1, or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were deleted. METHODS: Sectioning of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy were performed on right knee joints of wild-type and knockout mice. Left joints served as unoperated controls. Serial histologic sections were obtained from throughout the whole joint of both knees 4 days or 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after surgery. Sections were graded for OA lesions on a scale of 0-6 and were assessed for breakdown of tibial cartilage matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan) and type II collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases with immunohistochemistry studies using anti-VDIPEN, anti-NITEGE, and Col2-3/4C(short) neoepitope antibodies. Proteoglycan depletion was assessed by Alcian blue staining and chondrocyte cell death, with the TUNEL technique. RESULTS: All knockout mice showed accelerated development of OA lesions in the medial tibial cartilage after surgery, compared with wild-type mice. ICE-, iNOS-, and particularly IL-1beta-knockout mice developed OA lesions in the lateral cartilage of unoperated limbs. Development of focal histopathologic lesions was accompanied by increased levels of MMP-, aggrecanase-, and collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitopes in areas around lesions, while nonlesional areas showed no change in immunostaining. Extensive cell death was also detected by TUNEL staining in focal areas around lesions. CONCLUSION: We postulate that deletion of each of these genes, which encode molecules capable of producing degenerative changes in cartilage, leads to changes in the homeostatic controls regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism, favoring accelerated cartilage degeneration. These observations suggest that these genes may play important regulatory roles in maintaining normal homeostasis in articular cartilage matrix turnover.",M2
14645573,"Protection against murine leukemia virus-induced spongiform myeloencephalopathy in mice overexpressing Bcl-2 but not in mice deficient for interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthetase, <e>ICE</e>, Fas, Fas ligand, or TNF-R1 genes.Some murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), among them Cas-Br-E and ts-1 MuLVs, are neurovirulent, inducing spongiform myeloencephalopathy and hind limb paralysis in susceptible mice. It has been shown that the env gene of these viruses harbors the determinant of neurovirulence. It appears that neuronal loss occurs by an indirect mechanism, since the target motor neurons have not been found to be infected. However, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Several lymphokines, cytokines, and other cellular effectors have been found to be aberrantly expressed in the brains of infected mice, but whether these are required for the development of the neurodegenerative lesions is not known. In an effort to identify the specific effectors which are indeed required for the initiation and/or development of spongiform myeloencephalopathy, we inoculated gene-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice with ts-1 MuLV. We show here that interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), ICE, Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-R1 KO mice still develop signs of disease. However, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in neurons (NSE/Bcl-2) were largely protected from hind limb paralysis and had less-severe spongiform lesions. These results indicate that motor neuron death occurs in this disease at least in part by a Bcl-2-inhibitable pathway not requiring the ICE, iNOS, Fas/FasL, TNF-R1, and IL-6 gene products.",M2
14642889,"Production and mechanism of secretion of interleukin-1beta from the marine fish gilthead seabream.Mammalian interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a secretory cytokine lacking a signal peptide, which does not follow the classical endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi pathway of secretion. Its post-translational processing by IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and subsequent release from activated macrophages requires ATP acting on P2X7 receptors. Little information is available on the production and release of fish IL-1beta, but the IL-1beta gene sequences reported to date lack a conserved ICE recognition site. We show for the first time that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/macrophage-activating factor/bacterial DNA (VaDNA)-primed immune cells of the marine fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) accumulate intracellular IL-1beta as a approximately 30 kDa polypeptide (proIL-1beta). The combination of LPS and VaDNA was found to be synergistic, suggesting that each ligand is recognized by a different pattern recognition receptor. More importantly, addition of extracellular ATP does not promote IL-1beta secretion by immune cells and fails to induce phosphatidylserine flip. In contrast, gilthead seabream SAF-1 fibroblasts shed microvesicles containing a 22 kDa IL-1beta form within 30 min of activation with ATP. Notably, the post-translational processing of IL-1beta by SAF-1 cells is abrogated by a specific ICE inhibitor.",M2
14610233,"The interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitor pralnacasan reduces dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine colitis and T helper 1 T-cell activation.The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 are supposed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease. To exert biological activity, the precursors of both IL-1beta and IL-18 need to be cleaved by the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). IL-18 induces the synthesis of IFN-gamma in T cells and NK cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the specific ICE inhibitor pralnacasan in dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine colitis. Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium dissolved in drinking water for 10 days. Pralnacasan was administered either intraperitoneally or orally every day. To assess in vivo efficacy, a clinical disease activity score was evaluated daily. Colon length, expression of IL-18 in colonic tissue, expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in paraaortal lymphocytes, and systemic production of IFN-gamma in splenocytes were analyzed post mortem. Intraperitoneally administered pralnacasan significantly reduced the clinical score compared with the dextran sulfate sodium control group from day 6 to day 10. Oral administration of pralnacasan also significantly reduced the clinical score at days 8 and 9. Administration of pralnacasan i.p. reduced the expression of intracolonic IL-18 significantly. Furthermore, pralnacasan reduced the number of IFN-gamma-positive lymphocytes in paraaortal lymph nodes. IFN-gamma synthesis in stimulated splenocytes was significantly suppressed in all pralnacasan-treated groups. No side effects of pralnacasan were observed. In conclusion, pralnacasan is effective in the prevention of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. This effect is probably mediated by suppression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma.",M2
14598973,"Impaired interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) activity in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.We measured the activity of IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) of monocytes from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were collected from PTB patients (n = 16) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Serum IL-18 levels were significantly higher in PTB patients (515.9 +/- 326.5 pg/ml) than in controls (108.7 +/- 65.2 pg/ml) (P &lt; 0.01), but gradually decreased with tuberculosis therapy. ICE activity was significantly lower in TB patients (65.3 +/- 34.4 vs. 142.2 +/- 75.6 U/mg) (P &lt; 0.05). Serum IL-18 levels inversely correlated with ICE activity (P &lt; 0.05). Altered ICE activity may explain why there is reduced IFN-gamma production from PBMCs; however, serum IL-18 is probably not regulated by ICE in monocytes in TB patients.",M2
14584052,"Gingival and dermal fibroblasts produce interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme and interleukin-1 beta but not interleukin-18 even after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.Epithelial cells play a critical role in periodontal disease through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). However, the role played by fibroblasts is still unclear. The rationale of this study was to throw light on the role of gingival fibroblasts in periodontal disease. We thus investigated the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and <e>ICE</e> mRNA and the secretion of the corresponding proteins by human normal gingival fibroblasts before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ICE mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA. We demonstrated that gingival fibroblasts expressed ICE mRNA. Basal expression of ICE was modulated following cell stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (5 mug/ml). However, gingival fibroblasts expressed low levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. The expression was potentiated by LPS. The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was followed by the secretion of IL-1 beta but not IL-18 protein. Our study suggests that fibroblasts may be involved in the defense against infections via an IL-1 beta-mediated but not an IL-18-mediated mechanism.",M2
14515361,"Cycloheximide and actinomycin D delay death and affect bcl-2, bax, and <e>Ice</e> gene expression in astrocytes under in vitro ischemia.An in vitro ischemia model was established and the effect of the metabolic inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (ActD) on apoptosis in astrocytes under ischemia studied. CHX decreased by 75% the number of cells dying after 6 hr of ischemia compared with control cultures. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining of comparable cultures was reduced by 40%. ActD decreased cell death by 60% compared with controls. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced by 38%. The nuclear shrinkage in TUNEL-positive astrocytes in control cultures did not occur in ActD-treated astrocytes, indicating that nuclear shrinkage and DNA fragmentation during apoptosis are two unrelated processes. Expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta), bax, and Ice in astrocytes under similar ischemic conditions, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indicated that ischemia down-regulated bcl-2 (alpha and beta) and bax. Ice was initially down-regulated from 0 to 4 hr, before returning to control levels after 8 hr of ischemia. ActD decreased the expression of these genes. CHX reduced the expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta) but increased bax and Ice expression. It is hypothesized that the balance of proapoptotic (Bad, Bax) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl) proteins determines apoptosis. The data suggest that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bad in astrocytes following ActD and CHX treatment does not decrease as much in untreated cells during ischemia. Our data indicate that it is the ratio of Bcl-2 family members that plays a critical role in determining ischemia-induced apoptosis. It is also important to note that ischemia-induced apoptosis involves the regulation of RNA and protein synthesis.",M2

13129693,"Pralnacasan, an inhibitor of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme, reduces joint damage in two murine models of osteoarthritis.OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of pralnacasan, the orally bioavailable pro-drug of a potent, non-peptide inhibitor of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), RU 36384/VRT-18858, on joint damage in two mouse models of knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: In a collagenase-induced OA model, pralnacasan was given orally by gavage to female Balb/c mice at 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg twice a day. In the second study, pralnacasan was tested in male STR/1N mice, which develop OA spontaneously, by administering food-drug mixtures ad libitum at concentrations of 0, 700 and 4200 ppm (mg/kg food). OA joint damage was assessed by a semi-quantitative histopathological score in both studies. In the STR/1N mouse study, urinary levels of collagen cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment and RU 36384/VRT-18858 plasma concentrations was measured after 6 weeks. RESULTS: In both studies, the mice developed moderate to severe knee joint OA in the medial joint compartments (tibial plateau and femoral condyle), the non-treated control groups showing median histopathological scores from 18 to 21 of a maximal score of 32. Pralnacasan was well tolerated. At the doses of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg in collagenase-induced OA and at the high dose of 4200 ppm in STR/1N mice pralnacasan treatment significantly reduced OA by 13-22%. In the STR/1N mice, urinary levels of HP cross-links and the ratio of HP/LP, which are indicators of joint damage in OA, were significantly reduced in the high dose group by 59 and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ICE inhibitor pralnacasan reduced joint damage in two experimental models of OA and has the potential to become a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of OA.",M2
12969109,"Pancuronium bromide, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant which promotes apoptosis of blood lymphocytes in vitro.BACKGROUND: Several compounds used in anesthesia practice have demonstrated to impair immune function and to influence the process of apoptotic death in T cell population following surgical trauma. We designed this study to test in vitro the impact of neuromuscular blocker, such as pancuronium, at clinically relevant concentration on lymphocyte apoptosis, death factor expression and mitochondrial function. METHODS: Following isolation, lymphocytes were incubated with pancuronium bromide at a clinically relevant concentration (0.136 micro mol l-1) for 3 h at 37 C in a 5% carbon-dioxide-humidified atmosphere and the frequency of apoptotic lymphocytes was then measured. We also investigated crucial steps in the apoptotic process, including Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) phenotype, intracellular expression of the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) p20, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and glutathione (GSH) levels. Control experiments were performed incubating cells in the complete culture medium added with the dilution medium of the drug without addition of the drug. RESULTS: Expression of Fas, FasL and ICEp20 was six-fold, four-fold, and five-fold increased, respectively, among pancuronium-treated lymphocytes with respect to control cultures (P = 0.0001). The percentage of cells exhibiting either dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential or increased production of reactive oxygen species was seven-fold increased following exposure to pancuronium compared with untreated lymphocytes (P = 0.0001). These findings were associated with a decrease in GSH level. In addition, the frequency of apoptotic cells was 10-fold greater among lymphocytes cultured in the presence of the drug with respect to control cultures. (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest an apoptogenic effect of pancuronium in vitro at clinically relevant concentration on peripheral blood lymphocytes. This could be implicated in the transient immune suppression following a surgical operation.",M2
12929137,"Early NFkappaB activation is inhibited during focal cerebral ischemia in interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme deficient mice.Our previous study demonstrated that the inhibition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) reduces ischemic brain injury; however, the molecular mechanism of the action of IL-1 in cerebral ischemia is unclear. We are investigating currently the role of NFkappaB during focal cerebral ischemia, using mutant mice deficient in the interleukin-1 converting enzyme gene (<e>ICE</e> KO) in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Adult male ICE KO and wild-type mice (n = 120) underwent up to 24 hr of permanent MCAO. Cytoplasmic phospho-NFkappaB/p65 expression in ischemic brain was examined using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. NFkappaB DNA-binding activity was detected using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression was examined in both the ICE KO and wild-type mice (WT). Western blot analysis and immunostaining showed that the level of cytosolic phosphorylated NFkappaB/p65 increased after 2 and 4 hr of MCAO in WT mice; however, NFkappaB/p65 was significantly reduced after MCAO in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05). EMSA showed that NFkappaB DNA-binding activity increased after MCAO in WT mice; but this effect was reduced in the ICE KO mice. The number of ICAM-1-positive vessels in the ischemic hemisphere was greatly attenuated in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05), which paralleled the results of immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that NFkappaB phosphorylation is reduced in ICE KO mice, suggesting that ICE or IL-1 are involved in early NFkappaB phosphorylation. Because cerebral ischemia induced infarction is significantly reduced in ICE KO mice, we conclude that early NFkappaB phosphorylation plays a disruptive role in the ischemic process.",M2

Apoptosis and cell phenotype were determined by FACS. sTNF-R1, sCD95, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (sICE), and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by ELISA. PHA and CD3-driven T cell proliferation were significantly decreased in ESRD patients. CD3(+), CD19(+) B cells, and percentage of CD4(+) T cells were significantly reduced. Percent memory T cells (CD45RO(+)) and cells undergoing apoptosis (CD95(+)/Annexin V+) were significantly increased in ESRF. Moreover, sCD95, sTNFRI, and <e>ICE</e> were significantly increased. Serum level of IL-10, a Th2 cytokine, was enhanced. These findings strongly suggest that in ESRD patients Th1 T cells are selectively susceptible to undergo apoptosis.

12829320,"Hypoxic induction of caspase-11/caspase-1/interleukin-1beta in brain microglia.Caspase-11 is an inducible protease that plays an important role in both inflammation and apoptosis. Inflammatory stimuli induce and activate caspase-11, which is required for the activation of caspase-1 or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Caspase-1 in turn mediates the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, which is one of the crucial mediators of neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Here, we report that hypoxic exposure of cultured brain microglia (BV-2 mouse microglia cells and rat primary microglial cultures) induces expression and activation of caspase-11, which is accompanied by activation of caspase-1 and secretion of mature IL-1beta and IL-18. Hypoxic induction of caspase-11 was observed in both mRNA and protein levels, and was mediated through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Transient global ischemia in rats also induced caspase-11 expression and IL-1beta production in hippocampus supporting our in vitro findings. Caspase-11-expressing cells in hippocampus were morphologically identified as microglia. Taken together, our results indicate that hypoxia induces a sequential event-caspase-11 induction, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1beta release-in brain microglia, and point out the importance of initial caspase-11 induction in hypoxia-induced inflammatory activation of microglia.",M2
12810350,"Role of Fas/Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis in murine contact hypersensitivity.Apoptosis plays an important role in immune responses, but little is known about its involvement in contact hypersensitivity (CH). In this study, we have investigated the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CH. Mice were sensitized by one topical application of 100 microl of 3% oxazolone to shaved skin of the abdomen. Six days later, CH was provoked by challenging both sides of sensitized mouse right ear with 15 microl of 1% oxazolone. Using a DNA ladder assay, we found that apoptosis was induced in the skin of oxazolone-sensitized mice 24-96 h after allergen challenge. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(-)), but not late apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(+)), increased in the inflamed skin of mice with CH. Moreover, the expressions of mRNAs for T helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4), Th1 cytokine (interferon (IFN)-gamma) and proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Fas, FasL and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1) were significantly elevated in the oxazolone-sensitized mouse skin 6-72 h after allergen challenge. Dramatic increase in IL-10 mRNA was only observed in the sensitized mouse skin 6 and 12 h after allergen challenge. Furthermore, CH was significantly inhibited with decreased apoptosis and early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in inflamed skin in Fas mutant lpr/lpr mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas there were no significant differences in IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, Bax and ICE mRNAs in the inflamed skin of CH between lpr/lpr and wild-type mice. Our results thus suggest that Fas/FasL pathway partially contributes to apoptosis in murine CH and that Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays a partial role in the development of CH. The contribution of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis to CH appears independent of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.",M2
12796490,"Maturation and release of interleukin-1beta by lipopolysaccharide-primed mouse Schwann cells require the stimulation of P2X7 receptors.The P2X7 receptor, mainly expressed by immune cells, is a ionotropic receptor activated by high concentration of extracellular ATP. It is involved in several processes relevant to immunomodulation and inflammation. Among these processes, the production of extracellular interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays a major role in the activation of the cytokine network. We have investigated the role of P2X7 receptor and of an associated calcium-activated potassium conductance (BK channels) in IL-1beta maturation and releasing processes by Schwann cells. Lipopolysaccharide-primed Schwann cells synthesized large amounts of pro-IL-1beta but did not release detectable amounts of pro or mature IL-1beta. ATP on its own had no effect on the synthesis of pro-IL-1beta, but a co-treatment with lipopolysaccharide and ATP led to the maturation and the release of IL-1beta by Schwann cells. Both mechanisms were blocked by oxidized ATP. IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), the caspase responsible for the maturation of pro-IL-1beta in IL-1beta, was activated by P2X7 receptor stimulation. The specific inhibition of ICE by the caspase inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde blocked the maturation of IL-1beta. In searching for a link between the P2X7 receptor and the activation of ICE, we found that enhancing potassium efflux from Schwann cells upregulated the production of IL-1beta, while strongly reducing potassium efflux led to opposite effects. Blocking BK channels actually modulated IL-1beta release. Taken together, these results show that P2X7 receptor stimulation and associated BK channels, through the activation of ICE, leads to the maturation and the release of IL-1beta by immune-challenged Schwann cells.",M2

12639813,"Reduced apoptosis by pentoxiphylline among patients with HIV infection.BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a significant cause of CD4(+) T cell death. Caspase 8 (FLICE) is involved in apoptosis mediated by Fas and p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor ligation. It is also partially mediated by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; caspase 1). We and others have shown that pentoxiphylline inhibits TNF-alpha. We used it among patients with HIV infection to determine if 24 weeks of therapy altered the levels of caspase 1 and caspase 8. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen HIV-infected patients having no opportunistic infection at the time of recruitment were administered pentoxiphylline 400 mg thrice daily for 24 weeks. Caspase levels were measured using a single-step ELISA using commercially available monoclonal antibodies against caspase 1 and caspase 8. RESULTS: Mean CD4 counts of the patients were 202.6+/-111.6 (/mm(3)). Mean OD value of caspase 1 among patients before therapy was 0.302+/-0.197 and was higher than that of controls (0.287+/-0.064), but this was not statistically significant. Following 24 weeks of therapy with pentoxiphylline, the OD value declined significantly to 0.164+/-0.028 among patients (p&lt;0.001). Mean OD value of caspase 8 among patients prior to therapy was 0.927+/-0.249. This was significantly higher than that of controls, whose level was 0.0074+/-0.004 (p&lt;0.001). Following 24 weeks of therapy with pentoxiphylline, the OD value declined to 0.199+/-0.064 among patients and this was significantly lower than the value at the start of treatment (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Therapy with pentoxiphylline for 24 weeks is associated with a decline in the levels of caspase 1 and caspase 8. Since the drug is known to produce TNF inhibition, this might result in reduced apoptosis and an improved CD4 lymphocyte survival.",M2
12628757,"Caspase-1 inhibitors abolish deleterious enhancement of COX-2 expression induced by HIV-1 gp120 in human neuroblastoma cells.The human CHP100 neuroblastoma cell line has been shown to provide an useful in vitro model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gp120 neurotoxicity. Here we report western blotting evidence demonstrating that exposure to a cytotoxic concentration of the viral coat protein up-regulates expression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in neuroblastoma cells and this seems to be due to the previously observed increase in secreted IL-1beta. In fact, here we show that acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD-CMK) and t-butoxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid benzyl ester-chloromethylketone (Boc-Asp-(OBzl)-CMK), two inhibitors of Interleukin-1 Converting Enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; also referred to as caspase-1), abolish COX-2 expression enhanced by gp120 and consequent cell death. In addition, NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 activity, affords neuroprotection strengthening the role of COX-2 in the mechanisms of death. In conclusion, the present data support the notion that IL-1beta is the signal through which gp120 elevates COX-2 expression and the latter is strongly implicated in the mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity.",M2
12597888,"A bicistronic expression system for bacterial production of authentic human interleukin-18.Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is activated and released from immune effector cells to stimulate acquired and innate immune responses involving T and natural killer (NK) cells. The release of IL-18 from mammalian cells is linked to its proteolytic activation by caspases including interleukin 1 converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). The absence of a signal peptide sequence and the requirement for coupled activation and cellular release have presented challenges for the large-scale recombinant production of IL-18. In this study, we have explored methods for the direct production of authentic human IL-18 toward the development of a large-scale production system. Expression of mature IL-18 directly in Escherichia coli with a methionine initiating codon leads to the production of MetIL-18 that is dramatically less potent in bioassays than IL-18 produced as a pro-peptide and activated in vitro. To produce an authentic IL-18, we have devised a bicistronic expression system for the coupled transcription and translation of ProIL-18 with caspase-1 (ICE) or caspase-4 (ICE-rel II, TX, ICH-2). Mature IL-18 with an authentic N-terminus was produced and has a biological activity and potency comparable to that of in vitro processed mature IL-18. Optimization of this system for the maximal production yields can be accomplished by modulating the temperature, to affect the rate of caspase activation and to favor the accumulation of ProIL-18, prior to its proteolytic processing by activated caspase. The effect of temperature is particularly profound for the caspase-4 co-expression process, enabling optimized production levels of over 150 mg/L in shake flasks at 25 degrees C. An alternative bicistronic expression design utilizing a precise ubiquitin IL-18 fusion, processed by co-expressed ubiquitinase, was also successfully used to generate fully active IL-18, thereby demonstrating that the pro-sequence of IL-18 is not required for recombinant IL-18 production.",M2
12396474,"Increased apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with perennial allergic asthma/rhinitis: relation to serum markers of apoptosis.BACKGROUND: The goal of our study was to examine spontaneous and stimulated apoptosis of peripheral blood MNC from allergic patients, sensitized to Der p I antigen as compared to cells from non-atopic subjects. Furthermore we aimed to investigate which populations of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, monocytes) undergo the apoptosis and to determine relations between apoptosis and serum levels of sFas/APO-1, <e>ICE</e>/caspase-1 or TNF-alpha. METHODS: The study included 17 patients with perennial, allergic asthma and/or allergic rhinitis [6 male and 11 female; mean age 29,5 years; (range 15-49)]. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence technique and confirmed by flow-cytometric method and DNA ladder. Serum levels of sFas, ICE/caspase-1 or TNF-alpha were determined by immunoassays (ELISA). RESULTS: Apoptotic index of unfractionated mononuclear cells (MNC) and lymphocytes (but not monocytes) were significantly higher in allergic patients as compared to non-allergic subjects after 48 and 72 hours of culture (p&lt;0.05). Incubation of cells with ConA (10 microg/ml) resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells in all populations once the apoptotic index for MNC and lymphocytes (but not monocytes) was again significantly higher in allergic as compared to non-allergic subjects after 24, 48 and 72 hour of culture. In allergic patients, mean serum sFas level, was significantly lower then in non-allergic group (mean value 624.8 pg/ml +/- 25.67 versus 802.0 pg/ml +/- 31.91; p = 0.003) and in both groups sFas level correlated inversely with apoptosis of MNC. The mean ICE/caspase-1 concentration was significantly higher in sera of allergic patients as compared to non-allergic group (mean value 27.71 pg/ml +/- 3.79 vs 23.54 pg/ml respectively; p&lt;0.01). ICE/caspase-1 levels in allergic patients correlated with apoptotic index of mononuclear cells (r = 0.57; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increased spontaneous and mitogen-induced apoptosis of MNC from peripheral blood of atopic patients as well as different serum levels of sFas and ICE/caspase-1 correlating with apoptosis, suggest different regulation of apoptotic process in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with allergic asthma and/or rhinitis.",M2
12384922,"The in situ up-regulation of chondrocyte interleukin-1-converting enzyme and interleukin-18 levels in experimental osteoarthritis is mediated by nitric oxide.OBJECTIVE: To investigate in situ the relationship between 2 key mediators implicated in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage: nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-1-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was also studied and served as reference for the effects of ICE. METHODS: An OA model was created in dogs by sectioning (stab wound) the anterior cruciate ligament of the right stifle joint. Three experimental groups were studied: unoperated untreated dogs, operated untreated dogs (OA), and OA dogs treated with oral N-iminoethyl-L-lysine (L-NIL), a specific inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (10 mg/kg twice a day starting immediately after surgery). At 12 weeks after surgery, cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus were processed for immunohistochemistry for ICE, IL-18, and protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9), a natural inhibitor of ICE, followed by morphometric analysis. Cartilage specimens from the femoral condyles of untreated OA dogs were dissected and incubated with specific inhibitors of different signaling pathways likely to be involved in the OA process: SB 202190 (10 microM; a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] inhibitor), PD 98059 (100 microM; a MAPK kinase 1/2 [MEK-1/2] inhibitor), NS-398 (10 ng/ml; a specific cyclooxygenase 2 [COX-2] inhibitor), and L-NIL (50 microM). RESULTS: Both ICE and IL-18 were present in situ in the canine cartilage, with a significant increase in the level of these 2 proteins in OA cartilage. In contrast, the level of PI-9 was lower in OA than in normal cartilage (difference not statistically significant). Compared with untreated OA cartilage, oral treatment with L-NIL significantly decreased ICE and IL-18 levels in cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, to values similar to those in normal dogs. L-NIL also increased the PI-9 level in normal dogs compared with OA dogs, reaching statistical significance for femoral condyle cartilage. Interestingly, in vitro experiments demonstrated significant inhibition of ICE levels by p38, MEK-1/2, and COX-2 inhibitors, but not by the iNOS inhibitor. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that in situ in OA cartilage, the stimulation of chondrocytes by NO is at least partly responsible for the up-regulation of ICE and IL-18 synthesis while decreasing the level of the ICE inhibitor PI-9. The ICE level is controlled by the activation of at least 2 MAPK pathways, p38 and MEK-1/2. Interestingly, it appears that ICE synthesis is not regulated by the endogenous production of NO. These data highlight the role played by iNOS in regulating the synthesis of major catabolic factors involved in OA cartilage degradation.",M2
12322783,"Similar time-course of interleukin-1 beta production and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in permanent focal brain ischemic injury.The present study investigated the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the potential role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the brain's response to focal brain ischemia in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model. Phosphorylated ERK p44 and p42 were increased time-dependently and significantly 18- and 28-fold, respectively, at 24-h post-pMCAO. Similarly, IL-1beta protein levels were significantly increased with the peak at 24 h in the lesioned core of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side. Previous studies using various stimuli have shown ERK-dependent IL-1 induction. The results from our study suggest that this relation may also exist in vivo in ischemic brain tissue. Based on the progressive nature of IL-1 induction, we hypothetized that inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) could provide an extended time-window for neuroprotection. Therefore, we applied N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD x fmk), an ICE blocker 3 or 6 h after pMCAO. Reductions of infarct volume, however, were not observed. Taken together with previous results, where we showed protective activity of zVAD x fmk when given immediately after pMCAO, we conclude that the time window for zVAD x fmk is less than 3 h.",M2
12237341,"Revisiting an old antimicrobial drug: amphotericin B induces interleukin-1-converting enzyme as the main factor for inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in activated endothelia.We have investigated the impact of the widely used antifungal agent Amphotericin B (AmB) on cytokine activated aortic endothelial cells (AEC) and their inflammatory response as monitored by cytokine and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression as well as high-output nitric oxide synthesis. Because both blood-borne infections and systemically administered drugs will first encounter vessel lining endothelial cells, this cell type represents an important participant in innate immune reactions against xenobiotics. Culturing cytokine-activated AEC in the presence of 1.25 microg/ml AmB, a concentration equivalent to serum levels during patient treatment, we find increases in iNOS promoter activity up to 120%, in iNOS mRNA or protein expressions by factors of up to 3.5 +/- 1.1, and in iNOS activity of up to 180% compared with cells with cytokines only. In parallel, a strong increase in endothelial interleukin (IL)-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and IL-1beta expression and activity was observed. Specific inhibition of ICE activity or IL-1beta functionality significantly reduces expression and activity of the iNOS to control values. Because ICE activity is essential for the endogenous synthesis of active IL-1beta, ICE overexpression represents the key signal in the AmB-induced and IL-1beta-mediated effects on iNOS activity. In summary, in endothelial cells, AmB strongly augments cytokine-induced iNOS expression and activity by increasing the expression and activity of the ICE. This adjuvant activity for augmented endogenous cytokine processing adds to the efficacy of the antimycotic activity of AmB. Furthermore, our data underline the relevance of the endothelial iNOS as a potent effector of the innate immune system.",M2
12168884,"Serum concentrations of APO-1/Fas and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme in osteosarcoma correlate with response to chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic drugs used in neoadjuvant chemotherapy may exert their effect by activation of apoptosis. Both APO-1/Fas and Interleukin-1beta-converting (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1 are believed to act as mediators of apoptotic cell death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sera of 21 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma were tested at the time of diagnosis by ELISA and compared with clinical data. RESULTS: The mean APO-1 serum levels were 844 +/- 344 pg ml(-1) and the mean ICE serum levels were 212 pg ml(-1) +/- 155 pg ml(-1) for all patients. Furthermore, both serum levels were found to be statistically significantly higher in patients with good regression grades compared to those in patients with bad regression grades. CONCLUSION: In highly-malignant osteosarcoma elevated serum levels of both APO-1 and ICE seem to be predictive of good response to chemotherapy.",M2
12123203,"Expression of apoptosis-related genes in chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in mice.To define the mechanism of cyclosporine (CsA)-induced apoptosis, we investigated the expression of apoptosis-related genes in experimental chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. Mice on a low-salt (0.01%) diet were given vehicle (VH, olive oil, 1 mg/kg/day), or CsA (30 mg/kg/day), and sacrificed at 1 and 4 weeks. Apoptosis was detected with deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain, and the expressions of apoptosis-related genes were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot or immunohistochemistry. The activity of caspase 1 and 3 was also evaluated. The CsA group showed increases in apoptotic cells compared with the VH group (54 +/- 41 vs. 3 +/- 3, p &lt; 0.05), and the number of apoptotic cells correlated well with interstitial fibrosis scores (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.01). The CsA group showed a significant increase in Fas-ligand mRNA (0.20 vs. 0.02 amol/microgram total RNA, p &lt; 0.05) and Fas protein expression (146% vs. 95%, p &lt; 0.05), compared with the VH group. The CsA group showed significant increases in <e>ICE</e> mRNA (0.21 vs. 0.03 amol/microgram total RNA at 4 weeks, p &lt; 0.05) and CPP32 mRNA (0.18 vs. 0.03 amol/microgram total RNA at 4 weeks, p &lt; 0.05), compared with the VH group. The enzymatic activity of ICE (16.6 vs. 7.9 rho mol/microgram/h, p &lt; 0.05) and CPP32 protease (15.6 vs. 2.7 rho mol/microgram/h, p &lt; 0.05) proteases were increased in the CsA group, compared with the VH group. The ratio between bax and bcl-2 protein increased significantly in the CsA group (5.3-fold), compared with the VH group. Levels of p53 protein also increased in the CsA group. Immunohistochemical detection of Fas, Fas-ligand, ICE and CPP32 revealed strong immunoreactivity in renal tubular cells in areas of structural injury. These findings suggest that local activation of the apoptosis-related genes is associated with CsA-induced apoptotic cell death.",M2
12106600,"Interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (caspase-1) in intestinal inflammation.An imbalance of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) versus type 2 (Th2) polarization in favor of Th1 cell subsets appears to be a key pathogenic mechanism in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular in Crohn's disease. The interferon gamma-inducing factor interleukin (IL)-18 acts in strong synergism with the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12. Recent studies provide evidence for the participation of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of IBD: IL-18 expression is increased in inflamed lesions of Crohn's disease patients and neutralization of IL-18 in different models of experimental colitis resulted in a dramatic amelioration of disease severity. IL-18 and IL-1beta are cleaved and thereby activated by the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Activation of ICE also occurs during different types of infectious colitis, and ICE expression and subsequent release of IL-1beta and IL-18 significantly contribute to intestinal inflammation. ICE knockout mice as well as mice treated with the ICE inhibitor pralnacasan are protected against experimental mucosal inflammation. Thus, inhibition of ICE represents an intriguing new target that requires further investigation in animal models.",M2
12052343,"High level expression and purification of bioactive bovine interleukin-18 using a baculovirus system.Bioactive recombinant bovine interleukin-18 (rboIL-18) was expressed using a baculovirus system. Normally, IL-18 is translated as a precursor form of a 24kDa polypeptide and processed by IL-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) to a mature bioactive form of 18kDa protein. Hence, to express active form IL-18, we constructed two recombinant baculoviruses containing boIL-18 and human ICE (hICE) genes, respectively, and superinfected these viruses into insect cells. Superinfection of both recombinant viruses into the cells resulted in the expression of a 24kDa precursor form and an 18kDa mature form detectable in the supernatant by immunoblotting using anti-porcine IL-18 antibody. Culture supernatant from the superinfected cells showed a synergistic effect with recombinant boIL-12 for production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in bovine peripheral mononuclear cells. By addition of histidine hexamer at the C-terminal of boIL-18, the mature IL-18 was purified. Bioactivity remained after purification.",M2
12010237,"Apoptosis-related proteins in the testes of infertile men with varicocele.OBJECTIVES: To assess immunohistochemically the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the testes of infertile men, to determine which of these proteins were related to hypospermatogenesis, as a previous report suggested that apoptosis was suppressed in infertile men with varicocele. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>) and caspase-3 (CPP32) were examined in bilateral testicular specimens from 26 infertile men with varicocele and six normal testicular specimens, using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Clinical variables were also assessed. RESULTS: Bax, ICE, and CPP32 were expressed in germ cells, while Bcl-2 was not. Differences in staining in left or right testes were not significant. In both testes of infertile patients with varicocele, significantly fewer germ cells stained for CPP32 than in controls (P &lt; 0.001). For Bax and ICE, total germ cell staining was similar between these groups. Staining was less frequent in infertile patients for both CPP32 and ICE when the analysis was restricted to spermatogonia. Serum luteinizing hormone levels correlated positively with CPP32 staining (P = 0.0457). CONCLUSIONS: The reduced expression of CPP32 participates in regulating apoptosis in the testes of infertile men with varicocele.",M2
11948692,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 mediates interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells.Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as one of interferon family that regulates antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory responses, has been implicated for the growth regulation of ovarian cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully defined. To analyze detailed mechanisms, the ovarian cancer cell lines (2774, PA-1, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3) were treated with IFN-gamma. The growth of 2774 was most effectively suppressed than that of other cells in both time-course and dose-dependent experiments. The order of sensitivity in other cells was PA-1 &gt;&gt; OVCAR-3 &gt; SKOV-3 (not responded at all). The DNA fragmentation and DAPI staining assays suggested that the IFN-gamma-mediated cytotoxicity could be triggered by apoptosis. The treatment induced IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in two IFN-gamma-sensitive cells (2774, PA-1), whereas IRF-1 was not induced in two IFN-gamma-resistant cells (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3). The levels of p53 and p21WAF1 were not strikingly changed in all four cells. Interestingly, the expression of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, or caspase-1) was increased by the treatment in a kinetically consistent manner to the induction of IRF-1. However, CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was not changed. Apoptosis was greatly induced, when IRF-1 was transiently expressed in PA-1 without the treatment of IFN-gamma. However, it was repressed when IRF-1 together with IRF-2, an antagonist of IRF-1, were coexpressed. In addition, the effect of IFN-gamma was reduced in the 2774 and PA-1 cells stably expressing either IRF-1 antisense or IRF-2 sense, as shown by the cytotoxicity and FACS analysis. Furthermore, the IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was greatly reduced, when inhibitors of ICE were treated into PA-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that IRF-1 directly mediates the IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis via the activation of caspase-1 gene expression in IFN-gamma-sensitive ovarian cancer cells.",M2
11948465,"Expression of interleukin-18 in human ovarian carcinoma and normal ovarian epithelium: evidence for defective processing in tumor cells.Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory monokine structurally related to IL-1beta that stimulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. IL-18 is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-IL-18, which is cleaved by IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1 in a mature protein. In view of the proposed use of IL-18 in cancer immuno/gene therapy, we have studied the expression of IL-18 in tumor cells. IL-18 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in all human ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested (9/9) and in one-half of tumor cell populations obtained from ovarian carcinoma patients (4/8). ICE mRNA was expressed in a smaller fraction of samples (3/9 cell lines and 3/8 samples from patients). IL-18 protein was also found in 7/13 ovarian carcinoma solid tumors by immunohistochemic analysis. In tumor cell lines we were able to detect abundant intracellular pro-IL-18 (24 kDa) by Western blotting, whereas the mature form of IL-18 was undetectable, irrespective of the presence of ICE mRNA and protein. Only pro-IL-18 was also found in the ovarian carcinoma cell supernatants, which did not display any IL-18 biologic activity in functional assays. Normal cultured ovarian epithelial cells revealed the presence of both IL-18 and ICE mRNA in all samples (5/5) and IL-18 protein was expressed by the thin epithelial cell layer surrounding normal ovary. More importantly, normal ovarian epithelial cells released low but detectable amounts of mature IL-18 in the culture supernatant, which displayed IL-18-like biologic activity in functional assays. These data suggest that mature biologically active IL-18 production is a feature of the normal ovarian surface epithelium lost during neoplastic transformation.",M2

11890646,"Novel targets for interleukin 18 binding protein.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 18 (IL18) is related to the IL1 family by structure, receptors, signalling molecules, and function. IL18 induces gene expression and synthesis of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL1, Fas ligand, several chemokines, and vascular adhesion molecules. Similar to IL1beta, IL18 is synthesised as a biologically inactive precursor molecule lacking a signal peptide. The IL18 precursor requires cleavage into an active, mature molecule by the intracellular cysteine protease, IL1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, or caspase-1). Inhibitors of ICE activity limit the biological activity of IL18 in animals and may be useful in reducing the activity of IL18 in human disease. However, a constitutively secreted IL18 binding protein (IL18BP) exists which functions as a natural inhibitor of IL18 activity. IL18BP binds IL18 with a high affinity (Kd of 400 pM) and, at equimolar ratios, inhibits 50-70% of IL18; at twofold molar excess, IL18BP neutralises nearly all IL18 activity. METHOD: IL18 was investigated for its role in human myocardial function. An ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) model of suprafused human atrial myocardium was used to assess myocardial contractile force. RESULTS: The addition of IL18BP to the perfusate during and after I/R resulted in improved post-I/R contractile function from 35% of control to 76% with IL18BP. Also, IL18BP treatment preserved intracellular tissue creatine kinase levels (by 420%). Because active IL18 requires cleavage of its precursor form by ICE, inhibition of ICE attenuated the depression in contractile force after I/R (from 35% of control compared with 75.8% in treated atrial muscle, p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Myocardial ischaemia is a target for IL18BP and use of IL18BP may thereby reduce ischaemia-induced myocardial dysfunction.",M2
