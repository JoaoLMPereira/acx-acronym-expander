19779766,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis with multifocal bone lesions: comparative clinical features between single and multi-systems.Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can be a single system or multi-system disease. Both disease types can be associated with multi-focal bone lesions, but their bone involvement patterns have not been compared systematically. Of the new pediatric LCH cases enrolled into the JLSG-02 study during 2002-2007, 67 cases of single system multifocal bone (SMFB) LCH and 97 cases of multi-system bone (MSB) LCH were analyzed to determine if the bone involvement patterns differ in these two types, and whether these differences correlate with outcome. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and other measures. Onset ages were higher for SMFB (P &lt; 0.001), but the two types did not differ in the number of bone lesions per patient. The skull was most frequently affected in both types, followed by the spine. Lesions in the temporal bone (P = 0.002), ear-petrous bone (P &lt; 0.001), orbita (P = 0.003), and zygomatic bone (P = 0.016) were significantly more common in MSB. The two types did not differ in response to treatment, but MSB was associated with a significantly higher incidence of diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) (P &lt; 0.001). Novel measures are required in preventing the development of DI in MSB-type LCH patients with  risk  bone lesions.",M1
19380027,"Acute myeloid leukemia and diabetes insipidus with monosomy 7.The predisposition of monosomy 7 to diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) led us to ask whether AML associated with monosomy 7 and DI will differ from AML associated with other karyotype aberrations and DI and whether the outcome of patients with AML and DI will differ from those without DI. We describe 2 patients from Roswell Park Cancer Institute and discuss 29 additional cases from the literature. AML with monosomy 7 and DI (n = 25) had a trend towards a lower complete remission (p = 0.0936) and worse survival (p = 0.0480) than AML with other karyotype changes and DI (n = 6). Further, AML with monosomy 7 and DI had worse complete remission rate and overall survival than AML with monosomy 7 but without DI. In conclusion, it appears that AML with monosomy 7 and DI is a disease entity with specifically poor outcome.",M1
19364693,"Diabetes insipidus, panhypopituitarism, and severe mental status deterioration in a patient with chordoid glioma: case report and literature review.OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare progressive case of chordoid glioma clinically masquerading as idiopathic diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). METHODS: We describe the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of the study patient and briefly review the relevant literature. RESULTS: A 41-year-old woman was referred to our center for evaluation of worsening mental status changes, a newly diagnosed suprasellar mass, and possible endocrine dysfunction. Three years earlier, a physician at another institution diagnosed idiopathic DI and prescribed desmopressin. At that time, laboratory workup and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no brain lesions or other hormonal irregularities. Slow, progressive symptomatology in the following 3 years included mental status changes, nonhealing skin lesions, recurrent infections, temperature dysregulation, and midsection weight gain. She became withdrawn and emotionally labile and developed a flat affect, short-term memory loss, poor concentration, and sleep disturbance. MRI revealed a 2.2 x 2.1 x 1.9-cm suprasellar region lesion. Biopsy samples from the third ventricular lesion revealed a circumscribed glial tumor. Chordoid glioma is a rare tumor, and the 50 previously reported cases have been located in the suprasellar region. This is the third reported case of a chordoid glioma positive for neurofilament protein, which brings into question the hypothesis of a single phenotype for glial tumors. Tumors in this region frequently result in endocrine dysfunction that prompts patients to seek medical attention. CONCLUSIONS: There is no formally recognized treatment protocol for chordoid glioma, and postoperative mortality and morbidity is high. Our report emphasizes the necessity of close follow-up of patients after a diagnosis of idiopathic DI. Early detection of any evolving occult hypothalamic-pituitary stalk lesion may improve outcome.",M1
19199508,"Incidence, clinical manifestations, and course of water and electrolyte metabolism disturbances following transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgery: a prospective observational study.OBJECT: The authors prospectively studied the incidence, spectrum of clinical manifestations, course, and risk factors of water and electrolyte disturbances (WEDs) following transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgery. METHODS: From the preoperative day to the 14th postoperative day, 57 successive patients undergoing transsphenoidal adenomectomy were monitored daily for body weight, balance of fluids, serum electrolytes, plasma osmolality, plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels, urinary sodium excretion, urinary osmolality, and subjective sensation of thirst. The type of adenoma operated on and the intraoperative manipulation of the neurohypophysis were also recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (mean age 55 years, 61.4% females) harbored 30 clinically hormone-inactive and 27 hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. Postoperative WED occurred in 75.4% of the patients: in 38.5% as isolated diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>); in 21% as isolated hyponatremia; and in 15.7% as combined DI-hyponatremia. The maximum of medians of diuresis (5.750 L) in patients with isolated DI occurred on postoperative Day 2. Nadir of medians of hyponatremia (132 mmol/L) in patients with isolated hyponatremia occurred on postoperative Day 9. In patients with combined DI-hyponatremia, maximum of medians of diuresis (5.775 L) occurred on the 2nd day and nadir of medians of hyponatremia (130 mmol/L) on the 10th postoperative day. Altogether, 8.7% of the patients had to be treated with desmopressin because of DI persisting for &gt;3 months. Of all the patients with hyponatremia, 42.8% were treated by transient fluid-intake restriction due to an IH of &lt;130 mmol/L with or without clinical symptomatology. Transient acute renal failure occurred in one of these patients. Generally, the occurrence of postoperative WEDs was linked to the intraoperative manipulation of the neurohypophysis. Increased thirst correlated significantly with DI (p=0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and decreased thirst with the hyponatremic episode in patients with combined DI-hyponatremia (p=0.003). Decreased urine osmolality correlated significantly with the presence of DI (p=0.023). Electrolyte-free water clearance and urinary Na+ excretion were not correlated with DI and hyponatremia. Antidiuretic hormone was not suppressed during hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Water and electrolyte disturbances occurred in the majority of patients undergoing transsphenoidal adenomectomy and were usually transient. Diabetes insipidus is more frequent than hyponatremia. Diabetes insipidus usually occurs during the 1st postoperative day and resolves in the majority of cases within 10 days. In few patients, DI may persist and require therapy with ADH analogs. Hyponatremia usually occurs at the end of the 1st postoperative week and resolves in most cases within 5 days. Very few patients will need treatment other than fluid-intake restriction to avoid serious complications. Thus, careful monitoring of the WEDs in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgery is mandatory for the first 10 postoperative days.",M1
19112432,"Breast cancer with diabetes insipidus.Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is a rare clinical condition, which is usually caused by neurohypophyseal or pituitary stalk infiltration in cancer patients. CASE REPORT: we present a 62-year old metastatic breast cancer woman with DI. She admitted to the hospital because of nausea, vomiting, polyuria and polydipsia, while she was on no cytotoxic medication. She had no electrolyte imbalance except mild hypernatremia. The CT scan of the brain yielded a suspicious area in pituitary gland. A pituitary stalk metastasis was found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pituitary. Water deprivation test was compatible with DI. A clinical response to nasal vasopressin was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients who have symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, polyuria and polydipsia while they are not on chemotherapy should be evaluated for not only metabolic complications like hypercalcemia but also posterior pituitary or stalk metastasis MRI could be the choice of imaging for pituitary metastasis.",M1
18599930,"Central diabetes insipidus: clinical profile and factors indicating organic etiology in children.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the profile of children with central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) and identify factors indicating organic etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. SUBJECTS: Fifty-nine children with central DI (40 boys, 19 girls). METHODS: Features of organic and idiopathic central DI were compared using students t test and chi square test. Odds ratio was calculated for factors indicating organic etiology. RESULTS: Diagnosis included post-operative central DI (13, 22%), central nervous system (CNS) malformations (5, 8.6% holoprosencephaly 4 and hydrocephalus 1), histiocytosis (11, 18.6%), CNS pathology (11, 18.6%; craniopharyngioma 3, empty sella 2, germinoma 2, neuro-tuberculosis 2, arachnoid cyst 1 and glioma 1) and idiopathic central DI (19, 32.2%). Children with organic central DI were diagnosed later (7.8+/- 3.1 years against 5.3+/-2.4 years, P=0.03) and had lower height standard deviation score (-2.7+/-1.0 versus -1.0+/- 1.0, P&lt;0.001) compared to idiopathic group. A greater proportion of children with organic central DI had short stature (81.8% against 10.5%, P &lt;0.001, odds ratio 38.25), neurological features (45.5% against 0%, p 0.009) and anterior pituitary hormone deficiency (81.8% against 5.3%, P&lt;0.001, odds ratio 81) compared to idiopathic group. A combination of short stature and onset after five years of age led to discrimination of organic central DI from idiopathic group in all cases. CONCLUSION: Organic central DI should be suspected in children presenting after the age of five years with growth retardation and features of anterior pituitary deficiency.",M1
18502321,"Neuropeptide Y in the arcuato-paraventricular pathway and diet selection in the vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rat.Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most important brain peptides involved in feeding behavior. It influences both food choice and fluid homeostasis. The paraventricular and arcuate nuclei belong to the main pathway through which NPY stimulates carbohydrate intake. In this study, we measured NPY in various hypothalamic microdissected areas in Brattleboro <e>di</e>/di rats, a rat model of diabetes insipidus with specific dietary preferences. We confirmed that this rat is characterized by an increased fat intake (+10%; p&lt;0.001) and a decreased carbohydrate intake (-10%; p&lt;0.001) leading to a completely different dietary profile than that of di/+ controls. This profile was associated with a decrease in NPY in the paraventricular nucleus (-33%; p&lt;0.005) and in the ventromedial nucleus (-24%; p&lt;0.002). Intake of carbohydrate was negatively correlated with the gradient of NPY concentration between the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei. NPY could therefore contribute to the qualitative changes of feeding behavior in the Brattleboro rat through altered transport/release of the peptide and participate in the balance of neuropeptides that determines food choice in this strain of rat.",M1
18433729,"[MRI imaging of the neural pituitary]The main illness of the neural pituitary is diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). MRI is essential if DI occurs during childhood, in order to highlight malignant germinoma prognosis of which remains excellent if the diagnosis is made as early as possible. In adults, primary intracranial tumours causing DI include craniopharyngioma, or pineal tumours. Infiltrative histiocytosis is another frequent aetiology. One third of previously considered idiopathic DI is in fact auto-immune. Early MRI findings advocate for such a diagnosis. Finally, meticulous analysis of the neural pituitary imaging may avoid several pitfalls and help the analysis of adenopituitary abnormalities.",M1
17952274,"Syndromes related to sodium and arginine vasopressin alterations in post-operative neurosurgery.BACKGROUND: Cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) are frequently found in postoperative neurosurgery. PURPOSE: To identify these syndromes following neurosurgery. METHOD: The study included 30 patients who had been submitted to tumor resection and cerebral aneurysm clipping. Sodium levels in serum and urine and urine volume were measured daily up to the 5th day following surgery. Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) was measured on the first, third and fifth days post-surgery. RESULTS: CSWS was found in 27/30 patients (90%), in 14 (46.7%) of whom it was associated with a reduction in the levels of plasma AVP (mix syndrome). SIADH was found in 3/30 patients (10%). There was no difference between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: CSWS was the most common syndrome found, and in half the cases it was associated with DI. SIADH was the least frequent syndrome found.",M1
17927955,"Hypothalamic galanin and plasma leptin and ghrelin in the maintenance of energy intake in the Brattleboro rat.Galanin, ghrelin, and leptin are three peptides involved in feeding regulation and more particularly in fat intake. The Brattleboro (<e>di</e>/di) rat is a genetic model of diabetes insipidus characterized by a preference for fat when it is in a food choice situation. Here, we measured hypothalamic galanin concentrations, plasma ghrelin and leptin and dietary preferences of adult di/di Brattleboro rats, di/+ and Long-Evans controls. The Brattleboro rats weighed significantly less than the di/+ rats (-18%; P&lt;0.001). The fat-to-carbohydrate intake ratio was significantly greater in Brattleboro rats than in di/+ (P&lt;0.02) when the rats could choose between a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate diet. Galanin concentrations were significantly lower in di/di rats than in di/+ rats in the paraventricular nucleus (-56%; P&lt;0.001), but not in the arcuate nucleus. Plasma leptin was significantly lower in the di/di rats than in the di/+ rats (3.49+/-0.20 vs. 6.94+/-0.49 ng/ml; P&lt;0.001). Plasma ghrelin concentrations were significantly lower in Long-Evans rats than in the di/di rats (-21%; P&lt; 0.01). Given that galanin mRNA is overexpressed in the paraventricular nucleus of Brattleboro rats, these data are consistent with increased release of the peptide. In the Brattleboro rat, this overactive galanin system and the variations of ghrelin and leptin maintain an orexigenic drive favoring a preferential intake of fat which provides the animal with enough energy for its metabolism.",M1
17663299,"Remission of congenital diabetes insipidus after eight years.Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) (De Morsier's syndrome) is a complex developmental disorder marked by variable and often incomplete formation of cranial midline structures, resulting in absence of the septum pellucidum, optic nerve hypoplasia, and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. We describe a patient with SOD who manifested symptoms in the early neonatal period with severe deficiencies of multiple pituitary hormones including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). Her congenital diabetic insipidus (<e>DI</e>), consequence of an anatomic defect, can be argued to be of the most severe type. Our patient resolved her severe DI 8 years after her initial presentation, suddenly requiring no further medical treatment for DI following longstanding pharmacological replacement of ADH. This is the first report of a patient with SOD with spontaneous resolution of congenital DI.",M1
17564004,"[Diabetes insipidus in acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage after clipping of aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery and the anterior communicating artery]In the presented case, clipping of aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery (A CeA) and the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) in acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) was complicated by the development of vasospasm and transient diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). The cause of DI was ischemia of the anterior portions of the hypothalamus due to ACeA and ACoA spasm. The use of the standard triple H-therapy protocol in the presence of DI failed to achieve the optimal parameters of hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion pressure due to the development of severe polyuria. Addition of the standard triple H-therapy protocol by hormonal replacement therapy with desmopressin could yield adequate systemic hemodynamic parameters. During this treatment, the state became stable and vasospasm regressed. The manifestations of DI ceased with the values of cerebral circulation being normal.",M1
17541748,"Symptomatic pituitary metastases from renal cell carcinoma.Symptomatic metastases to the pituitary (MP) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are rare. In this largest case series reported, we describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of 5 patients. Over a 6-year period (2000-2006), we treated 5 patients (3 males; mean age 61 years) with large sellar masses and RCC. Four patients had a history of RCC, while in one, RCC was diagnosed after surgery. RCC was diagnosed a median of 11 years prior to diagnosis of MP (range 0-27 years). Four patients had previously developed distant metastases. Clinical presentation included bitemporal hemianopia (3 patients), lethargy (3), headaches (2) and diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) (2). Panhypopituitarism was present in 3 patients and the other two had deficiency of at least ACTH and gonadotropin axes. Elevated prolactin was seen in 3 patients. MRI showed an enhancing sellar mass with suprasellar extension and chiasmal compression in all; prominent vascular flow voids were seen in 2. Three patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery and radiation, while 2 underwent radiotherapy alone. Four patients are alive (follow up 6-46 months); 1 patient died due to systemic metastases at 12 months. Metastases to the pituitary from RCC cause more severe hypopituitarism and visual dysfunction compared to those from other primaries, whereas DI is less common. MRI shows contrast enhancement, stalk involvement, sclerosis and/or erosion of sella and presence of vascular flow voids. Combined treatment using decompressive surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy may result in better outcomes.",M1
17371462,"Clinical insights into adipsic diabetes insipidus: a large case series.OBJECTIVE: Adipsic diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) causes significant hypernatraemia. Morbidity and mortality data for patients with adipsic DI have been previously published as single case reports, rather than as formal trials or case series from units with established management protocols. Our objective was to describe morbidity and mortality in patients with adipsic DI attending a tertiary referral centre, representing the largest reported series of adipsic DI, and to suggest management protocols for such patients, based on our extensive experience of this condition. DESIGN: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) responses to hypotension were recorded during trimetaphan infusion. Sleep abnormalities were identified using overnight oximetry or polysomnography. Case-note analysis defined other clinical abnormalities including seizures and thrombotic episodes. Important clinical points for the management of these patients are highlighted. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with adipsic DI defined by thirst and plasma AVP responses to hypertonic saline infusion. RESULTS: All patients had absent AVP and thirst responses to osmotic stimulation, with subnormal water intake. Five patients had absent AVP responses to hypotension; the remainder had normal responses. Eight patients were obese [body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m(2)], and three were overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m(2)). Seven patients had sleep apnoea, of whom three died at 36 years or younger. Four patients developed venous thrombosis during episodes of hypernatraemia. Two patients had thermoregulatory dysfunction and seven patients had seizure activity. CONCLUSION: Adipsic DI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians should be aware of associated, treatable hypothalamic abnormalities such as obesity, sleep apnoea, seizures and thermoregulatory disorders when managing adipsic DI.",M1
17234837,"Development and performances of a Japanese quail line homozygous for the diabetes insipidus (<e>di</e>) mutation.A strain of Japanese quail with the polyuria disorder (excessive urination) was developed from founders that regurgitated water spontaneously. A back-cross with a nonpolyuric quail line showed that the polyuric strain was fixed for an autosomal recessive mutation that also induced polydipsia (excessive drinking). Plasma levels and brain mRNA contents for avian Arg vasotocin were little affected by the mutation, but plasma avian Arg vasotocin was 13-fold higher and brain mRNA contents were significantly increased in both normal and mutant quail following a 24-h water deprivation. Affected and normal birds had similar performance traits (egg production and quality, feed intake, and gross carcass traits), but residual feed consumption was higher in polydipsic males. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this strain was fixed for a mutation similar to the di gene described in the chicken and which induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This new strain of Japanese quail might constitute a convenient model for the analysis of the underlying mechanisms of the disorder in birds and for comparative study with mammals.",M1
17197021,"Erythroleukaemia, diabetes insipidus and hypophyseal damage: Two case reports.We report on two cases of patients who developed diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) before acute erythroleukaemia (EL). A brain MRI showed an empty sella turcica in one case and hypothalamo-hypophyseal peduncle damage in the second case. Reduced levels of TGF-beta1 and Vitamin D3, with associated EVI-1 over-expression and karyotypic abnormalities were documented. These two cases show specific chromosomal/molecular alterations in EL with DI. The hypothesis of pituitary involvement in erythroleukemogenesis is discussed.",M1

Mitochondrial dysfunction damages the oxidative pathway. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic delay in constituent diseases and early diagnostic impact over morbidity-mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study of 23 Spanish patients with SW. Different clinical entities analysis, onset age, lapse of time before diagnosis, morbidity-mortality causes, prescribed therapy and consanguinity between parents. RESULTS: Components prevalence: DM and optic atrophy (AO), 100%; auditory impairment, 95.65%; DI, 82.6%; gonadal atrophy, 75% in men; menstrual disorders, 87.5% in women. Other diseases: urinary tract, neurologic and heart disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients will develop almost all the complications. Juvenile DM in association with AO is its best diagnostic criteria. Early therapy should delay progression and control mortality causes.",M1
16635038,"Magnetic resonance imaging of thickened pituitary stalk proceeding to Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a child.Magnetic resonance imaging has shown isolated pituitary stalk thickening in certain cases of idiopathic or secondary central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) due to infiltrative processes. We present a 4-year-old boy who was initially diagnosed as having central DI. The MRI showed isolated pituitary stalk thickening with prominent homogeneous contrast enhancement. The remaining findings on MRI were within normal limits. The patient's personal and family history and laboratory and clinical findings were unremarkable; therefore, he was initially diagnosed as having idiopathic DI. Since central DI and isolated pituitary stalk thickening may be considered to be the first manifestations of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, we decided to follow up the patient. After 5 months, following the initial diagnosis, on skeletal X-ray survey, the patient did indeed develop multiple lytic skull lesions which, on biopsy, were histologically typical bone lesions of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",M1
16607917,"Morbidity and mortality associated with vasopressin analogue treatment.DDAVP is a drug that should be used with caution for each patient individually. Particular care is needed to avoid fluid overload and rapid fluctuations in sodium concentration. Not only families but physicians as well should be educated and aware of the adverse effects of DDAVP, especially in high risk patients. Extreme caution is needed in children with severe neurological and developmental problems who cannot control their fluid intake themselves. Similarly, caution is needed in patients with hypodipsia and <e>DI</e> who have difficulty in balancing water intake and DDAVP dose. The treatment of DI is water; however, DDAVP is given to avoid a large fluid intake which can result in medullary washout. Frequent home monitoring of body weight and regular determinations of serum sodium may help to disclose the early phase of over-hydration or dehydration. DDAVP therapy should be temporarily interrupted during acute illness, febrile episodes, hot days and other conditions with increased water intake. It should be used with considerable caution in patients with cystic fibrosis, or renal or cardiovascular diseases. In patients with enuresis, it is recommended that DDAVP medication should not be continued for longer than 3 months without stopping for 1 week for full reassessment. Fluid intake should be limited 1 hour before and 8 hours after the dose. Generally, undertreatment with vasopressin analogue is safer than overtreatment. A simple measure to avoid overtreatment is to miss one dose once a week; a rapid onset diuresis ('washout' effect) provides considerable reassurance.",M1
16565582,"Spontaneous resolution of diabetes insipidus after pituitary stalk sectioning during surgery for large craniopharyngioma. Endocrinological evaluation and clinical implications for surgical strategy.The mechanism of spontaneous resolution of diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) was investigated after surgery for large craniopharyngioma. Twenty-two adult patients (mean age 48.9 years old), who underwent surgery via the anterior interhemispheric trans-lamina terminalis approach, were divided into three groups: Group I, the entire pituitary stalk was preserved (n = 2); Group II, the stalk was dissected distally from the tumor but ultimately sacrificed (n = 9); Group III, the stalk was not identified and was sacrificed (n = 11). All patients were discharged without neurological deficits 1 month after surgery. Four patients underwent gamma-knife treatment for residual tumor or recurrence. Postoperative endocrinological functions were normal in Group I, and no replacement therapy was required. Hormonal replacement for pan-hypopituitarism and DI was necessary in Groups II and III (mean follow-up period 5.9 years). DI resolved at 2.7 +/- 1.3 years after surgery in four patients in Group II, and a hypertonic saline infusion test revealed production of small amounts of intrinsic antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Urine osmolarity was high in the morning, and a significant increase in urinary osmolarity was noted after Pitressin injection. These results indicate induction of hypersensitivity of the distal renal tubules to small amounts of intrinsic ADH, resulting in decreased urinary output. Recovery from DI can be expected, despite permanent impairment of anterior pituitary function, if the pituitary stalk is dissected as distally as possible.",M1
16483176,"Hypopituitarism induced by traumatic brain injury in the transition phase.Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with hypopituitarism in general and GH deficiency (GHD) in particular; the consequences of this on growth and development are likely to be critical in children and adolescents in the so-called  transition phase . In order to verify the consequences of TBI on pituitary function in the transition phase, we studied a population of adolescents and young adults 3 and 12 months after brain injury [no. = 23, 9 females, 14 males; age: 16-25 yr; body mass index (BMI): 21.9 +/- 0.6 kg/m2]. At 3 months, hypopituitarism was present in 34.6%. Total, multiple and isolated deficits were present in 8.6, 4.3 and 21.7%, respectively. Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) was present in 8.6% patients and mild hyperprolactinemia in 4.3%. At 12 months, hypopituitarism was present in 30.3%. Total, multiple and isolated deficits were present in 8.6, 4.3 and 17.4%, respectively. DI was present in 4.3% of patients and mild hyperprolactinemia in 4.3%. Total hypopituitarism was always confirmed at retesting. Multiple and isolated hypopituitarism were confirmed in 0/1 and 2/5, respectively. Two/23 patients showed isolated hypopituitarism at 12 months only; 1 patient with isolated at 3 months showed multiple hypopituitarism at retesting. GHD and secondary hypogonadism were the most common acquired pituitary deficits. These results show the high risk of TBI-induced hypopituitarism also in the transition age. Thus it is recommended that pediatric endocrinologists follow-up pituitary function of children and adolescents after brain injuries.",M1
16379033,"Spontaneous gonadotrophin deficiency recovery in an adult patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).Langerhans cell histocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease which exhibits a particular predilection for pituitary involvement leading to diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) and other anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies that are usually permanent and unresponsive to treatment. We report a 35 year old woman with a 10 year history of multisystemic LCH who developed DI, mild hyperprolactinemia, gonadotrophin and partial growth hormone deficiency following a normal delivery that was accompanied with infundibular thickening on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Following several courses of glucocorticoid administration, that were not associated with any substantial improvement, the patient was started on estrogen replacement therapy and cabergoline. After a three year period free of further relapses she developed irregular uterine bleeding. Following estrogen and cabergoline discontinuation she resumed normal menstruation while a repeated MRI of the pituitary showed an almost normal infundibulum. Endocrine investigation revealed normal gonadotrophin axis and prolactin levels, while the patient continues to menstruate, every 30-40 days, ten months after the resumption of her menstrual cycle. This case demonstrates for the first time that LCH induced pituitary deficiencies can run a variable clinical course and even spontaneously recover.",M1
16355806,"Endocrine disorders associated with holoprosencephaly.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of endocrinopathies in holoprosencephaly (HPE) and correlate the severity of the endocrinopathies with the neuroanatomic abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the histories and medical records of 117 children with HPE for endocrinopathies and related treatments. Neuroimaging studies were graded for severity of HPE, hypothalamus non-separation, and pituitary abnormalities. RESULTS: Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) occurred in 70% of patients with classic HPE. The severity of the DI correlated with the grade of HPE and hypothalamic non-separation (p &lt; 0.0001). Anterior pituitary dysfunctions were much less common. Hypothyroidism was identified in 11% of patients, hypocorticism in 7%, and growth hormone deficiency in 5%. Only one patient with middle interhemispheric variant of holoprosencephaly (MIH) had any of these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPE have a high incidence of DI that may be related to the failure of cleavage of hypothalamic nuclei. Anterior pituitary dysfunctions are much less common than DI.",M1
16235676,"Predictors of diabetes insipidus after transsphenoidal surgery: a review of 881 patients.OBJECT: Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is a common complication of transsphenoidal surgery. The purpose of this study was to elucidate patient- and surgery-specific risk factors for DI. METHODS: The perioperative records of 881 patients who had undergone transsphenoidal microsurgery at the authors' institution between January 1995 and June 2001 were reviewed. Among 857 patients without preoperative DI, the overall incidence of immediate postoperative DI was 18.3%, with 12.4% of patients requiring treatment with desmopressin at some point during their hospitalization. Persistent DI requiring long-term treatment with desmopressin was noted in 2% of all patients. An observable intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was strongly associated with an increased incidence of both transient (33.3%) and persistent (4.4%) DI. Craniopharyngioma and Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) were also associated with an increased incidence of transient and persistent DI, whereas repeated operation was not. Among patients with pituitary adenomas, those with Cushing's disease had an increased risk of transient (22.2%), but not persistent, DI. Patients with a microadenoma were more likely to suffer transient DI than those harboring a macroadenoma (21.6 compared with 14.3%) but were not more likely to experience persistent DI. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes insipidus remains a common complication of transsphenoidal surgery; however, it is most frequently transient in nature. Patients with an intraoperative CSF leak, a microadenoma, a craniopharyngioma, or an RCC appear to have an increased risk of transient DI. Risk factors for persistent DI include an intraoperative CSF leak, a craniopharyngioma, or an RCC.",M1
16091821,"Post-traumatic anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The recognition of hypopituitarism after head trauma is important because related neurobehavioral problems can be alleviated by hormone replacement. This study investigated the clinical presentations and imaging findings of patients with hypopituitarism developing after head trauma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with hypopituitarism from 1982 through 2002. Data on disease history and hormone deficiencies of patients with hypopituitarism which developed after head trauma were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with hypopituitarism or diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) due to head trauma, including 11 men and 7 women, were identified. Head trauma thus accounted for the etiology in 2.8% of all 635 patients with a diagnosis of hypopituitarism during the study period. The major cause of head trauma was road accident (n = 11, 61%). Ten of the patients (56%) had lost consciousness after the head injury. The duration from head trauma to the onset of symptoms of hypopituitarism ranged from &lt; 1 month to 15 years. Sex hormone (61%) and growth hormone (56%) were the most common hormone deficiencies, followed by corticotropin deficiency (39%) and thyrotropin deficiency (22.2%). DI developed in 9 patients (50%) and 5 of these patients had only DI without anterior hypopituitarism. Routine skull radiograph did not show abnormal signs. Among the 10 patients with magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland, a small or atrophic anterior lobe was seen in patients with anterior hypopituitarism. Loss of bright signal intensity from the pituitary posterior lobe on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was seen in all 3 patients with DI. An ectopic posterior lobe could be seen in 2 patients with hypopituitarism without DI. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of head trauma as the etiology of hypopituitarism may be overlooked if there is a long delay in onset after trauma. DI is a common early complication. Since anterior hypopituitarism can develop decades after the episode of head trauma, monitoring for endocrine dysfunction during follow-up of these patients is important.",M1
15924254,"Nephrolithiasis complicating treatment of diabetes insipidus.A decrease in urine volume is considered the therapeutic goal of the treatment of central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) with desmopressin (dDAVP). A low urine volume is a risk factor for kidney stone formation. This is the first report of nephrolithiasis in association with DI. It is likely that successful therapy with dDAVP and the patient's own purposeful decreased fluid intake contributed to calcium oxalate stone formation. Prevention of stone recurrence requires an increase in urine volume. The patient's compliance with this recommendation led to an episode of acute hyponatremia, a well-known complication of dDAVP therapy. The challenge of the management of stones in the setting of DI requires balancing the conflicting goals of both decreasing and increasing urine volume.",M1
15888562,"Vasopressin-V2 receptor stimulation reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans.In addition to its effect on water permeability, vasopressin, through its V2 receptors (AVPR2), stimulates Na reabsorption in the collecting duct by increasing the activity of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ENaC. This study evaluated whether dDAVP (a potent AVPR2 agonist) reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans (n = 6) and in patients with central (C; n = 2) or nephrogenic (N) diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) as a result of mutations of either the aquaporin 2 gene (AQP2; n = 3) or AVPR2 (n = 10). dDAVP was infused intravenously (0.3 microg/kg body wt in 20 min), and urine was collected for 60 min before (basal) and 150 min after the infusion. dDAVP markedly reduced both urine flow rate and sodium excretion in healthy individuals. A reduction in sodium excretion was also observed in CDI and NDI-AQP2 patients but not in NDI-AVPR2 patients. The magnitude of the fall in sodium excretion correlated with the rise in urine osmolality and the fall in urine output but not with the simultaneously observed fall in mean BP. These results suggest that the dDAVP-induced antinatriuresis is due to a direct V2 receptor-dependent stimulation of sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and is not secondary to a hemodynamic effect. In conclusion, this study reveals a potent V2-dependent antinatriuretic effect of vasopressin in humans. The possibility that an inappropriate stimulation of ENaC by vasopressin might lead to significant sodium retention in chronic situations remains to be determined.",M1
15799155,"Complications after trans-sphenoidal surgery: our experience and a review of the literature.The incidence of surgical complications after trans-sphenoidal surgery for pituitary lesions is low. The influence of size of the lesion and its pathology on the incidence of different types of complications and the remission rate of functioning adenomas are addressed in this retrospective study. Between 1996 and 2001, 126 trans-sphenoidal operations were performed on 108 patients with pituitary pathologies. Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) was the commonest (23%) and the incidence was higher with microadenomas and in those with Cushing's disease (p &lt; 0.05). Other important complications were: postoperative hypopituitarism 22%, CSF leak 13%, meningitis 5.5%, pneumocephalus 2.4%, visual deterioration 1.5%, haematoma 0.8% and 30-day mortality rate of 0.8%. Other complications encountered were subdural haematoma, epistaxis, SIADH, sphenoid abscess, deep vein thrombosis, thalamic infarct and hydrocephalus. No vascular injuries were encountered. The overall remission rate for acromegaly and Cushing's disease (22 patients each) was 77 and 81%, respectively. The remission rate was 100% for microadenomas, 89% for both acromegaly and Cushing's disease. More aggressiveness towards complete tumour removal increases the biochemical cure rate of functioning adenomas and on the other hand results in higher incidence of CSF leak and hypopituitarism.",M1
15757853,"The natural history of post-traumatic neurohypophysial dysfunction.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Posterior pituitary function remains poorly investigated after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We report the results of a study designed to prospectively define the natural history of post-traumatic diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) using standard reliable methodology. DESIGN AND METHODS: 50 consecutive patients with severe or moderate TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 3/15-13/15) were prospectively studied on three occasions: at the acute phase and at 6 months and at 12 months following TBI. In the acute phase, DI was diagnosed either by the presence of hypernatraemia in association with hypotonic polyuria or by the water-deprivation test (WDT) and, at 6 and 12 months by the WDT in all patients. Normative data on response to the WDT were obtained from healthy matched volunteers. Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). RESULTS: 13 patients (26%) had DI in the acute post-TBI phase, of whom nine patients recovered by 6 months and one additional patient recovered by 12 months. Of the remaining three patients with permanent DI, two had partial vasopressin deficiency. Acute-phase peak plasma osmolality correlated negatively with the initial GCS scores (r = -0.39, P = 0.005) and with the GOS scores (r = -0.45, P = 0.001). Seven patients had SIADH in the acute phase of TBI but none did at 6 or 12 months. No new cases of DI or SIADH were noted after the acute phase. CONCLUSION: This prospective study shows that posterior pituitary dysfunction is common following TBI. Most cases recover completely but there is an appreciable frequency of long-term DI which can be subtle and should be recognized and managed appropriately.",M1
15696461,"A case of lymphocytic hypophysitis with masked diabetes insipidus unveiled by glucocorticoid replacement.Lymphocytic hypophysitis may involve the pituitary gland and various hormonal abnormalities. A 72-year-old man presented with euvolemic hyponatremia caused by glucocorticoid deficiency. After glucocorticoid replacement, hypernatremia in the presence of dilute urine was found. Central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) was confirmed later by a significant increase in urine osmolality after vasopressin administration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a pituitary mass and loss of hyperintense signal in the posterior pituitary gland on T1-weighted imaging. The patient underwent a transsphenoidal adenectomy, and pathological examination of dissected tissues showed a typical finding of lymphocytic hypophysitis. Two months after surgery, the patient's central DI had resolved sufficiently that 1-desamino-8- d -arginine vasopressin therapy was discontinued without polyuria. However, he was kept on glucocorticoid and levothyroxine therapy. In conclusion, lymphocytic hypophysitis may feature a concealed central DI caused by glucocorticoid deficiency-associated hyponatremia.",M1

15579748,"Posterior pituitary dysfunction after traumatic brain injury.Disorders of water balance are well recognized after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there are no reliable data on their true prevalence in post-TBI patients. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of posterior pituitary dysfunction in a large cohort of survivors of TBI. One hundred two consecutive patients (85 males) who suffered severe or moderate TBI were evaluated for diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) at a median of 17 months (range 6-36 months) after the event, using the 8-h water deprivation test (WDT). Their results were compared against normative data obtained from 27 matched, healthy controls. Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of abnormalities of salt and water balance in the immediate post-TBI period. Twenty-two patients (21.6%) developed DI in the immediate post-TBI period (acute DI group), of whom five had abnormal WDT on later testing. In total, seven patients (6.9%) had abnormal WDT (permanent DI group), five of whom had partial DI. Patients in the acute and permanent DI groups were more likely to have more severe TBI, compared with the rest of the cohort (P &lt; 0.05). In the immediate post-TBI period, 13 patients (12.9%) had syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which persisted in one patient, and one other patient developed cerebral salt wasting. Diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone were common in the immediate post-TBI period. Permanent DI was present in 6.9% of patients who survived severe or moderate TBI, which is higher than traditionally thought. Identification of patients with partial posttraumatic DI is important because appropriate treatment may reduce morbidity and optimize the potential for recovery.",M1

The mean age was 26 years, male : female ratio was 3 : 1 and the mean disease duration of 10 years. All patients had hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia. Pituitary enlargement with thickening of the pituitary stalk were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement and attenuation in the intensity of the posterior lobe of the pituitary was detected without enhancement. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in the initial improvement of symptoms and gradual decrease in the tumor size but failed to cure polyuria due to DI.

15287450,"Neuroendoscopic findings in patients with intracranial germinomas correlating with diabetes insipidus.OBJECT: Intracranial germinomas commonly occur in the pineal region, the floor of the third ventricle (hypothalamus), or both, and they are often associated with diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). The authors conducted a study to correlate preoperative DI with the endoscopic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evidence of tumor on the third ventricle floor. METHODS: The authors reviewed hospital records, office charts, and MR imaging studies obtained in patients in whom a biopsy sampling procedure was performed with or without endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) at Children's Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama between May 1998 and July 2002. Ten patients with the pathological diagnosis of pure germinoma were identified. Preoperative MR imaging findings and presenting symptoms were correlated with intraoperative neuroendoscopic findings. Seven patients presented with symptomatic hydrocephalus and underwent concomitant ETV. Six patients presented with DI and MR imaging evidence of involvement of the third ventricle floor. Two patients presented with DI and no initial MR imaging evidence of neoplastic involvement of the third ventricle floor; in both there was endoscopic evidence of neoplastic involvement of the floor of the third ventricle. In two children without DI, neither MR imaging nor endoscopic evidence of involvement of the third ventricle floor was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' experience with intracranial germinoma, endoscopic tumor biopsy sampling, and ETV provide an effective, safe, and minimally invasive means of obtaining diagnostic tissue and treating any concomitant hydrocephalus. The authors found that preoperative DI is an absolute predictor of neoplastic involvement of the hypothalamus regardless of MR imaging findings. Therefore, in the setting of DI and intracranial germinoma without neuroimaging evidence of hypothalamic involvement, germinomatous involvement of the hypothalamus should be assumed present, if not confirmed endoscopically at the time of biopsy sampling or third ventriculostomy, when devising adjuvant treatment plans for such patients.",M1

A retrospective review of all trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during a 4-year period who developed DI was undertaken. The incidence of DI was 1.3 per cent in ICU trauma admissions and 2.9 per cent in traumatic head injuries admitted to the ICU. The overall mortality was 69 per cent (18/26). The mean onset time of DI in nonsurvivors (1.5 +/- 0.7 days) was shorter compared to survivors (8.9 +/- 10.2 days) (P &lt; 0.001). All patients who died developed DI within the first 3 days of hospitalization. Patients who develop DI early in their course have a higher mortality than those who develop DI later in their hospital course. The development of diabetes insipidus after head injury carries a 69 per cent mortality rate, and if the onset is within the first 3 days after injury, mortality rate rises to 86 per cent.",M1

In this study the authors developed and prospectively evaluated a multidisciplinary approach to the perioperative management of DI with a comparison to 19 historical control children. Eighteen children either with preoperative DI or undergoing neurosurgical operations associated with a high risk for developing postoperative DI were identified and managed using a standardized protocol. In all patients in whom DI occurred during or after surgery, a continuous intravenous infusion of aqueous vasopressin was initiated and titrated until antidiuresis was established. Intravenous fluids were given as normal saline and restricted to two thirds of the estimated maintenance rate plus amounts necessary to replace blood losses and maintain hemodynamic stability. In all children managed in this fashion, perioperative serum sodium concentrations were generally maintained between 130 and 150 mEq/L, and no adverse consequences of this therapy developed. In the 24-hour period evaluated, the mean change in serum sodium concentrations between the historical controls was 17.6 +/- 9.2 mEq/L versus 8.36 +/- 6.43 mEq/L in those children managed by the protocol. Hyponatremia occurred less frequently in the children managed with this protocol compared with historical controls.",M1
15134627,"Refining the staging evaluation of pineal region germinoma using neuroendoscopy and the presence of preoperative diabetes insipidus.Treatment strategies for CNS germinoma are currently evolving. Current approaches include reducing the volume and dose of radiation by adding pre-irradiation chemotherapy. Very accurate staging is necessary with such an approach to prevent failures. Eight consecutive patients with pineal germinoma at one institution underwent endoscopic surgery for tumor biopsy, direct visualization of the third ventricular region, and third ventriculostomy for those with hydrocephalus. All patients were treated with 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Conformal field radiation therapy followed, with the dose to the tumor bed dependent on the response to chemotherapy. Patients who had MRI, endoscopic, or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of multicentric or disseminated disease also received craniospinal radiation. Six patients had diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) at presentation. All 6 had tumor studding the floor of the third ventricle on endoscopic visualization, while only 4 of those patients had MRI evidence of disease in that region. All patients have completed therapy and are alive, with no evidence of disease at median follow-up of 31.5 months from diagnosis. Direct endoscopic visualization of the third ventricular region may be more sensitive than MRI for evaluating the presence of suprasellar disease and appears to add important information. This parameter should be added to the staging evaluation when feasible. In this series, the presence of DI was 100% predictive of suprasellar disease, even when the MRI was negative for involvement of that region. Patients should be evaluated for DI as part of the initial staging, and if it is present, the patients should be treated for suprasellar disease regardless of MRI findings.",M1
15049016,"Permanent consequences in Langerhans cell histiocytosis patients: a pilot study from the Histiocyte Society-Late Effects Study Group.BACKGROUND: Permanent consequences (PC) are often described among subjects with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) but data on the real incidence are scarce. Within the Histiocyte Society (HS), and in order to design a definitive late effects study, a retrospective survey was organized to describe the prevalence of PC among long-term survivors of LCH. METHODS: Nine institutions contributed with their LCH patients having a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Information was collected on their disease-history, and on type and date of onset of any PC. Because of the retrospective type of this study, it was accepted that each institution might have used different criteria to assess PC. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two subjects were registered and in 95 (52%) at least 1 PC was reported. For some specific PC (e.g., anterior pituitary dysfunction) information was too scarce to provide reliable data. PC were more frequent among subjects with multisystem (MS) disease (71%), compared to those with single system (SS) disease (24%); P &lt; 0.0001. The most frequently reported PC were diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) (24%) orthopedic abnormalities (20%), hearing loss (13%), and neurological consequences (11.0%). Analysis of cumulative risk showed that some types of PC may become manifest more than 10 years from diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This survey on selected cases of LCH survivors has confirmed that late sequels are frequent, and that they are even more common among those with MS LCH. Our findings highlight the need for long-term and patient-oriented follow-up in children with LCH.",M1
14687585,"Disorders of body water homeostasis.Disorders of body fluids are among the most commonly encountered problems in the practice of clinical medicine. This is in large part because many different disease states can potentially disrupt the finely balanced mechanisms that control the intake and output of water and solute. It therefore behoves clinicians treating such patients to have a good understanding of the pathophysiology, the differential diagnosis and the management of these disorders. Because body water is the primary determinant of the osmolality of the extracellular fluid, disorders of body water homeostasis can be divided into hypo-osmolar disorders, in which there is an excess of body water relative to body solute, and hyperosmolar disorders, in which there is a deficiency of body water relative to body solute. The classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), and the classical hypo-osmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This chapter first reviews the regulatory mechanisms underlying water and sodium metabolism, the two major determinants of body fluid homeostasis. The major disorders of water metabolism causing hyperosmolality and hypo-osmolality, DI and SIADH, are then discussed in detail, including the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",M1

In study 1, 114 patients with pituitary macroadenoma were randomized into three groups: conventional dose (inj. hydrocortisone 100 mg IV 6-hourly for 3 days); intermediate dose (inj. hydrocortisone 100 mg IV 6-hourly on day 1, 100 mg IV 8-hourly on day 2, and 100 mg IV 12-hourly on day 3); low dose protocol (inj. hydrocortisone 25 mg IV 6-hourly on day 1, 25 mg IV 8-hourly on day 2 and 25 mg IV 12-hourly on day 3). Radical excision was achieved in 92 patients. The incidence of DI with the conventional dose was 52%, intermediate dose, 36% and low dose, 24% (p = 0.025). Study 2 included 16 consecutive patients with Hardy's grade A &amp; B pituitary adenoma. These patients were randomized to receive (Group I) or not receive (Group II) hydrocortisone. Patients in Group II demonstrated normal cortisol response intraoperatively and no patient developed features of hypocortisolism; the incidence of DI in this group was 14%. The low dose hydrocortisone protocol reduced the incidence of DI by 46% when compared with the conventional dose hydrocortisone protocol. In patients with grade A and B tumour with normal preoperative cortisol levels, the use of perioperative hydrocortisone can be avoided.",M1

Although the PPBS indicates functional integrity of the posterior lobe, transient diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), caused by deficiency of ADH, is frequent early after surgery. We attempted to clarify how the shape, signal intensity and site of the PPBS before surgery are related to transient DI in the early postoperative period. We carried out MRI on 15 patients with a large adenoma and an ectopic PPBS before surgery and then within 1 week (early), 1-2 months (intermediate) and 6 or more months (late) after the operation. There were nine who had transient DI, which subsided by the intermediate study; none had permanent DI. Regardless of transient DI, the PPBS was visible, and its signal intensity was similar, on all postoperative studies. Although 11 did not change in shape, four showed a remarkable change from a flat shape before surgery to a rounded one postoperatively. On the intermediate MRI, the PPBS had descended to the level of the diaphragma as mass effect disappeared.",M1

Age-dependant dynamics of vasopressin content in neurohypophysis of WAG rats was also examined. It was shown that 10-day-old WAG rats were unable to elevate the synthesis of the 120 kDa protein in respond to long-term dehydration, while this tendency was clearly observed in the 15-day-old rats and later in the development. In WAG rats the onset of this specific feature was time correlated with the development of the respond to hydration by the elevation of vasopressin synthesis and release from neurohypophysis into blood. In the di/di rats dehydration had no effect on the kidney 120-kDa protein synthesis in all ages examined. These results point to the interaction between the di alleles and the 120-kDa protein-encoding gene in the course of development.",M1

She had been suffering hydrodipsia and dry mouth, and had lost 4 kg in 2 weeks. Hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and lower urinary specific gravity were preoperatively noted. Her electrolyte imbalance was partially corrected by the infusion of 1400 ml of 5% glucose solution and 500 ml of acetated Ringer's solution, but unexpected hyperglycemia; 440 mg.dl-1, appeared before surgery. Cesarean section was successfully performed with spinal anesthesia. A 1566 g male infant was delivered with 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 2 and 1. Hyperglycemia and secondary hypoglycemia occurred in the infant in the neonatal ICU. The mother's fluid loss, including blood and amniotic fluid, was estimated at 784 ml. Five hundred milliliters of acetated Ringer's solution and 1000 ml of half saline solution with 2.5% glucose were infused before delivery, followed by the glucose solution containing a low concentration of sodium after delivery. After surgery, high serum osmotic pressure and paradoxically low urinary osmotic pressure were found. The plasma antidiuretic hormone level was normal against the high serum osmotic pressure. The electrolyte imbalance and urinary osmotic pressure were improved by using I-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin, and <e>DI</e> was finally diagnosed.

12584270,"Vasopressin increases urinary albumin excretion in rats and humans: involvement of V2 receptors and the renin-angiotensin system.BACKGROUND: An increase in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) represents an early predictor of glomerular damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) and a risk factor for cardiovascular complications in hypertension. Vasopressin is elevated in DM and in some forms of hypertension. Previous studies in rats suggested that this hormone could play a role in the albuminuria observed in chronic renal failure or diabetic nephropathy, but no information is available concerning the mechanism of these effects and the possible influence of vasopressin on UAE in the healthy kidney. The present study was thus designed to evaluate whether vasopressin influences UAE in normal rats and humans, whether this effect is V(2)-receptor-dependent, and whether it is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. METHODS: UAE was measured in normal Wistar rats and healthy humans, or in subjects with various forms of diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), before and after acute or chronic infusion of the vasopressin V(2) receptor agonist dDAVP. Chronic dDAVP administration was also performed in normal Wistar rats previously submitted to either chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) or chronic blockade of AT1 receptors (ARB). RESULTS: In rats, acute or chronic dDAVP infusion increased UAE significantly and reversibly (4-fold and 6-fold, respectively). In healthy subjects, acute infusion of dDAVP tripled UAE (P&lt;0.01) but did not change creatinine and beta(2)-microglobulin excretion, thus suggesting that the rise in UAE was due to an increased glomerular leakage of albumin. dDAVP also increased UAE in patients with central DI and in patients with hereditary nephrogenic DI bearing AQP2 mutations. However, UAE was not increased in patients with hereditary nephrogenic DI bearing mutations of the V(2) receptor. In rats, ACEI and ARB blunted the dDAVP-induced rise in UAE by 70% (P&lt;0.05) and 50% (NS), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present studies reveal for the first time that vasopressin induces a marked increase in UAE in healthy rats and humans. This albuminuric effect seems to result from increased glomerular leakage, requires functional vasopressin V(2) receptors, and is, at least in part, mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. These results bring additional support for an involvement of vasopressin in the albuminuria observed in pathological states such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.",M1

In the control group, hypernatremia with a plasma level of 155 mEq/l or higher persisted for 12 hr from the 4th to the 16th hour after hypophysectomy, and symptoms of DI developed within five days after surgery. In the DDAVP treatment group, these changes were not observed, showing that administration of DDAVP (4 microg, installation, twice daily) effectively prevented hypernatremia that develops immediately after surgery and DI-like symptoms that persists for about one week after surgery.",M1

12402508,"V2R structure and diabetes insipidus.For most audiences, the term  diabetes  conjures thoughts of high levels of blood glucose and of the symptoms that characterize diabetes mellitus. In the last few years, a spirited campaign spear-headed by the families of affected individuals has made progress in educating nonprofessional and medical communities about diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), the other disease characterized by polyuria (i.e., diabetes). Much work lies ahead to find better treatments for this affliction, but the progress in molecular biology over the last years made possible the identification of the genetic defects underlying the inherited forms of the disease. Numerous cases of adult-onset DI are triggered by toxic damage to the kidneys that impairs the concentrating capacity of the nephrons by a nonspecific mechanism. In these pages I shall deal mostly with the inherited forms of the disease. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys of affected individuals to produce concentrated urine (Morello and Bichet 2001). The elimination of large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia) are the chief symptoms of the disease. Although this condition and the hints that it was a hereditary disease were described at the end of the 19th century, it took almost 100 years to gain molecular knowledge about its etiology. A brief review of the important role played by vasopressin in the maintenance of body fluids will help the reader understand the severity of this disease.",M1

12373675,"[Central diabetes insipidus: a case report]INTRODUCTION: Diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is a syndrome characterised by polyuria which is almost always associated with polydipsia. The most frequent cause is central DI, which is the result of an inadequate secretion of the diuretic hormone, and diagnosis involves differentiating it from other causes of polyuria and polydipsia. CASE REPORT: The authors report the clinical case of a previously healthy 4 year old girl, who, in December 1998, was found to have intense polydipsia accompanied by polyuria. Behavioural treatment was begun as an answer to what was thought to be psychogenic polydipsia, although results were unsatisfactory and the patient was brought to the Paediatric Nephrology Service at Hospital Maria Pia in June 1999. CONCLUSION: A clinical study, which included the water restriction test and concentration tests with desmopressin, enabled us to diagnose central DI. In spite of the results from a cranial NMR scan being normal, follow up time is still too short to classify the aetiology as idiopathic. The girl is asymptomatic under treatment with intranasal desmopressin. The favourable evolution in this case highlights the need to act in a thorough manner in the study of situations involving polyuria/polydipsia.",M1
12366717,"Myelodysplastic syndrome in transformation to acute myeloid leukemia presenting with diabetes insipidus: due to pituitary infiltration association with abnormalities of chromosomes 3 and 7.A 31-yr-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presented with initial symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. Cytogenetics revealed monosomy 7 and translocation (3;3)(q21;q26). The initial symptoms, in conjunction with a low serum level of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings demonstrating loss of the  bright spot  of the neurohypophysis, indicated diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), e.g. caused by leukemic infiltration of the neurohypophysis. After induction chemotherapy the patient's bone marrow revealed blast persistence, and following a second course of chemotherapy and normalisation of MRI, an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from the patient's HLA-identical brother was performed, resulting in ongoing complete remission. Recently, Lavabre-Bertrand et al. reported an association of AML with DI, elevated platelet counts, and monosomy 7 and chromosome 3 abnormalities in three patients (Eur. J. Haematol. 2001: 66: 66-69). Our report of an MDS with trilineage dysplasia and these karyotypic changes associated with DI indicates that this new entity may also include preleukemic cases.",M1

12006285,"Correlation of high signal intensity of the pituitary stalk in macroadenoma and postoperative diabetes insipidus.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High signal intensity (HSI) at the pituitary stalk is reported in pituitary adenomas. Our purpose was to clarify how and when this HSI formed, its long-term fate, and its relation to the function of infundibuloneurohypophyseal (INH) system. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with pituitary adenoma and supradiaphragmatic extension underwent 1.5-T MR imaging. Patients were assigned to two groups A (n = 18; those with stalk tip HSI) and B (n = 4; those without HSI) on postoperative T1-weighted images. Endocrine status was postoperatively evaluated and compared in both groups. RESULTS: Group A patients did not have postoperative permanent diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). Preoperative images in 17 patients revealed linear or ovoid HSI on the adenoma surface immediately above the diaphragma sellae. Of these, two with a poorly developed diaphragma sellae had HSI near the median eminence and inside the sella turcica. HSI was not apparent in the remaining patient with a giant, irregularly shaped adenoma. In group B, three patients had permanent DI. No patient had HSI on preoperative images. CONCLUSION: Postoperative pituitary stalk HSI is derived from preoperative supradiaphragmatic HSI on the adenoma surface. The suspected mechanism is blockage of the hypophyseal-pituitary axis, with an accumulation of neurosecretory granules at the diaphragmatic level. Diaphragmatic shape may influence the location of HSI. The shape and location of HSI are essentially stable for years after surgery. No patients with permanent DI had HSI before or after surgery. HIS at the pituitary stalk tip is a useful landmark for predicting functional integrity of the INH system in patients with a large pituitary adenoma.",M1

11689095,"Hypodipsic hypernatremia and diabetes insipidus following anterior communicating artery aneurysm clipping: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the amnestic rehabilitation patient.Hypodipsic hypernatremia (HH) represents a pathological increase in serum sodium due to a lack of thirst and defect in hypothalamic osmoreceptors. While 15% of patients with HH have a vascular aetiology, few cases have been described. Moreover, the presence of such abnormalities in the amnestic patient can have particularly threatening implications, as HH tends to recur unless the patient complies with a regimen of water intake. This study reports the case of a 46-year-old male admitted for rehabilitation of functional deficits following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), with clipping of an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm. Clinical examination was remarkable for profound short-term memory loss and inability to retain new information. Blood chemistry on admission showed a serum sodium level of 160 mEq/L, increasing to 167 mEq/L the following day. The patient denied thirst, and showed no clinical signs of dehydration. Neuroendocrine evaluation revealed diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) and HH. Treatment initially included DDAVP and intravenous hydration, later supplemented with chlorpropramide. Stabilization of serum sodium and osmolality did not ensue until the treatment regimen included hydrochlorothiazide and supervision of enforced fluid intake.

Rehabilitation interventions include establishing a structured medication regimen with fluid administration in the amnestic patient with hypothalamic dysfunction.",M1
11570128,"Polyuria and polydipsia. Diagnostic approach and problems associated with patient evaluation.Primary disorders of water balance (central diabetes insipidus [<e>DI</e>], nephrogenic DI, and psychogenic polydipsia) should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of polyuria and polydipsia. In general, animals with these disorders have only one laboratory abnormality: a low urine specific gravity. In most instances, the more common causes of polyuria and polydipsia (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, chronic renal failure, pyelonephritis, pyometra) have specific and obvious abnormalities associated with the complete blood cell count, the serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis. In some cases, however, a low urine specific gravity may be the only abnormality associated with these more common findings. The workup for polyuria and polydipsia can be tedious, time-consuming, expensive, confusing, and not without significant patient morbidity, especially in those cases with normal or near-normal blood work. This article focuses on the diagnostic approach and problems associated with diagnostic testing in patients with disorders of water balance.",M1
11516552,"Clinical features of symptomatic Rathke's cleft cyst.To investigate the clinical features of Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs), we retrospectively analyzed 15 cases with histologically confirmed RCCs. All patients underwent formal testing of visual field, endocrinological evaluation and magnetic resonance imagings. As overall presenting symptoms, endocrine disturbance was the most common symptoms, followed by visual disturbance and headache. Among the endocrine disturbances based on adenohypophysial dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia was most common. Considering the size of RCCs, RCCs could induce hyperprolactinemia only when the cysts became large enough to compress the infundibular system. Our series showed relative high incidence of pituitary dwarfism and diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). These facts indicated that RCCs could evoke hyposecretion of growth hormone in young patients and DI in aged patients by direct compression of the pituitary gland in the early stage of progression. All cases who had headache had no other symptoms. We could not prove the evidence that RCCs could induce headaches in these cases. This might be suggested that headache could not be a sole symptom in cases of RCCs.",M1
11515726,"Morbidity and mortality associated with vasopressin replacement therapy in children.OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and associated risk factors of adverse reactions of DDAVP treatment of children with diabetes insipidus, comparing different routes of administration. DESIGN: We retrospectively studied 103 children (44 females, 59 males) with cranial diabetes insipidus (mean age 6.9 years at diagnosis) treated with intramuscular (59), intranasal (84) and/or oral (64) DDAVP, over a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years. RESULTS: Eight patients died. For at least two children death was related to water intoxication. Major complications (symptomatic water overload with or without seizures) or asymptomatic hyponatraemia were observed in 33 patients. The incidence of total complications was significantly higher in cortisol deficient patients than in those with normal cortisol reserve (36% vs 6%). In patients on concomitant carbamazapine treatment major complications were more frequent in comparison to the remaining patients (33% vs 10%). Although not achieving significance, there were fewer complications using the oral route. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is needed in managing patients with <e>DI</e>, especially if risk factors such as cortisol deficiency or concomitant carbamazepine treatment are present. The oral route of administration seems to be preferred for both convenience and safety. Major changes in dose and formulation should be undertaken in hospital.",M1

Examinations of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M0). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed bilateral ERD, dense choroidal leukemia cell infiltration with overlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and focal areas of choroidal infarction. Changes in both osmolarity and electrolytes concentration of the serum and urine from vasopressin test supported the diagnosis of central DI. Central DI and ERD may be presenting signs of acute leukemia and both may represent CNS involvement. In our case, dense choroidal leukemic cell infiltration results in devitalization of RPE and choroidal infarction. Leukemic disruption of hypothalamic pituitary area may lead to complete or partial deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Rapid improvement in visual acuity and partial symptom relief of DI may ensue from appropriate chemotherapy and nasal DDAVP (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) supply.",M1
11477339,"Desmopressin impairs microcirculation in donor pancreas and early graft function after experimental pancreas transplantation.BACKGROUND: Protective effects of desmopressin in brain dead organ donors oppose reports on a hypercoagulatory potential and an increased leukocyte-endothelial interaction (LEI) after application of the drug. The aim was to evaluate the effect of desmopressin on organ donor's pancreas and early graft function. METHODS: Donor microcirculation was evaluated via intra-vital microscopy (IVM) in 24 BR (<e>di</e>/di) rats with central diabetes insipidus, randomly assigned to groups I (control without desmopressin application), II (single i.v. application, no pretreatment) or group III (single i.v. desmopressin application, s.c. pretreatment for 3 days). Microcirculation in recipients was evaluated 1 hr and 6 hr after syngenic pancreas transplantation. Groups III and I served as organ donors. After IVM specimens were taken for histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Desmopressin in II vs. I led to temporarily (30') increased LEI (Sticker 274.3+/-87.7 vs. 76.5+/-31.1/mm2 endothelial surface; P&lt;0.01) and impaired microcirculation (MCEV 0.43+/-0.07 vs. 0.99+/-0.06 mm/s; P&lt;0.01). Repeated application reduced MCEV and increased LEI for up to 12 hr. Histology in I vs. III showed increased inflammation (n.s.), necrosis (P&lt;0.05) and vacuolization (P&lt;0.01). Immunohistochemistry revealed increased endothelial P-selectin 20' after application. 6 hr after reperfusion organs from III showed reduced MCEV and increased LEI (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Repeated application of desmopressin impairs graft microcirculation. Perfusion of the pancreas is significantly reduced at the beginning of organ tissue conservation as well as after reperfusion. These disturbances might partly be due to observed endothelial P-selectin expression. Application of desmopressin up to 12 hr prior to organ explantation may impact graft quality.",M1
11274265,"Selective blockade of vasopressin V2 receptors reveals significant V2-mediated water reabsorption in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus.BACKGROUND: In a previous study we observed that acute administration of the selective antagonist of vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptors, SR 121463A (SR), aggravated the symptoms of diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) in homozygous Brattleboro rats (an AVP-deficient strain). The present study investigates in more details the acute and chronic effects of SR in DI rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: In experiment A, different groups of rats received acute i.p. injections of SR (0.001-10 mg/kg) or vehicle alone, and urine was collected for the next 24 h. SR dose-dependently increased urine flow rate and decreased urine osmolality with no significant change in solute excretion, thus confirming a pure 'aquaretic' effect. In experiments B and C, the chronic effects of orally administered SR were evaluated over 8 days in Brattleboro DI rats (experiment B, 1 mg/kg/day) and in adult Sprague-Dawley rats with normal AVP secretion (experiment C, 3 mg/kg/day). In DI rats, the aquaretic effects of SR persisted with the same intensity over the 8 days. In Sprague-Dawley rats, SR induced a sustained, stable aquaretic effect and also increased non-renal water losses, suggesting an effect of AVP on water conservation in extrarenal sites. Because oxytocin (OT) synthesis is elevated in DI rats and OT is known to bind to V2 receptors, we evaluated the antidiuretic effects of OT in DI rats in experiment D. Chronic infusion of OT (3 microg/kg/h, i.p.) induced a marked antidiuresis, and acute SR (1 mg/kg) in OT-treated DI rats completely abolished this antidiuretic effect, thus indicating that it was due to binding of OT to V2 receptors. CONCLUSION: (i) SR is a potent orally active aquaretic and induces stable effects during 1 week in rats with or without endogenous AVP secretion. (ii) Significant V2 receptor-mediated water reabsorption occurs in collecting ducts of Brattleboro DI rats because their usual urine osmolality is about twofold higher than the minimum observed during SR-induced maximum diuresis. (iii) This V2 agonism could be mediated in part by OT binding to V2 receptors. Small amounts of endogenous AVP, known to be produced by adrenal and testis in DI rats, could also contribute to this V2 agonism, as well as a possible constitutive activation of the V2 receptors. (iv) In normal rats, AVP probably reduces water losses through extrarenal sites, probably the lungs.",M1
11200921,"Aetiology and treatment response in patients with spontaneous diabetes insipidus.BACKGROUND: Spontaneous diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is an uncommon disorder. This study analysed aetiology and response to treatment in patients with spontaneous DI admitted to the endocrinology service of a teaching hospital. METHODS: Twenty patients were seen over a eight year period (1991-1998). The diagnosis of DI was confirmed in each case by the standard water deprivation test. Appropriate diagnostic procedures were carried out to determine aetiology. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had complete DI and four patients had partial DI. Eighteen had central DI and two nephrogenic DI. The etiology in sixteen of the eighteen patients with central DI included: histiocytosis--three, eosinophilic granuloma--two, neurosarcoidosis--three, viper-bite--one, head injury--two, germinoma--one, post RT--one, tuberculous meningitis--one, acute-sphenoid sinusitis--one and hypothalamic tumour--one. Eleven patients (61%) responded to tab. carbamazepine, while nine (45%) required intra-nasal DDAVP. One of the two patients with nephrogenic DI responded to thiazide diuretic. CONCLUSION: We identified the aetiology in 88% of our patients with central DI. Histiocytosis and sarcoidosis accounted for 40%. Most patients (61%) responded to treatment with oral carbamazepine, others required intra-nasal DDAVP.",M1
11174000,"Involvement of renal nerves and endothelins in the regulation of renal water excretion in diabetes insipidus rats.The interaction between renal nerves, endothelins acting via endothelin-A receptors and vasopressin in the regulation of renal excretory function was investigated. In conscious intact and renal denervated diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) Brattleboro rats, as well as their controls, Long-Evans (LE) rats, an infusion of 16.4 nmol/kg/min ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ-123 was performed in the course of 50 min. Femoral artery blood pressure, heart rate, Ccr, V x U(Na), V x U(K) and V x U(Cl) did not alter in any of the groups. Urine flow rate diminished by 38.1% (p &lt; 0.02), while urine osmolality increased by 30.3% (p &lt; 0.05) as a result of BQ-123 infusion in the intact LE rats but neither urine flow rate nor urine osmolality changed in the DI rats. In contrast to intact LE rats, BQ-123 infusion in renal denervated LE rats did not alter urine flow rate or urine osmolality. However, urine flow rate in renal denervated DI rats surprisingly decreased by 71.1% (p &lt; 0.01) while urine osmolality increased by 161% (p &lt; 0.001) as a result of BQ-123 infusion. Endogenous endothelins can regulate renal water excretion through ET(A) receptor activation. Renal sympathetic nerves participate in the modulation of renal water excretion influencing the ET(A) receptor-mediated effects of endothelins in the kidney.",M1
11136194,"Diabetes insipidus and anterior pituitary insufficiency as presenting features of Wegener's granulomatosis.Central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is a rare complication of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), which usually presents after pulmonary or kidney involvement. Anterior pituitary dysfunction secondary to WG has been extremely rare, documented in only three cases. We report a case of a 47-year-old postmenopausal woman who was diagnosed with hypopituitarism in November 1999 and started on vasopressin, thyroxine, and hydrocortisone. She sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic in February 2000 with a purpuric rash, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and blood in the sputum. Computed tomography of the chest showed a 6-cm irregular mass in the right lower lobe, and a biopsy of the mass showed marked reactive atypia and necrosis. Positive C-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and skin biopsy of a purpuric lesion showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis confirmed the diagnosis of WG. Hormonal studies showed low gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed cystic enlargement of the pituitary gland that did not enhance with gadolinium. Two months into the treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, she had persistent pituitary dysfunction, despite the normal appearance of the pituitary gland on repeat MRI. We conclude that WG should be included in the differential diagnosis of DI and anterior pituitary dysfunction in the proper clinical setting. Early diagnosis and treatment may be crucial in preventing pituitary gland destruction and long-term endocrine sequelae. We suggest screening for anterior pituitary failure in the presence of the WG-associated DI.",M1

It has been reported that intracranial pachymeningitis or orbital pseudotumor associated with multifocal fibrosclerosis could invade the sella turcica causing a variety of anterior and/or posterior pituitary dysfunctions. In our case, intracranial pachymeningitis apparently involved the pituitary stalk and gland. Isolated gonadotropin deficiency, in addition to central DI, preceded panhypopituitarism. Although panhypopituitarism with central DI due to multifocal fibrosclerosis is quite rare and only one case has ever been reported, this systemic fibrotic disorder can be a possible cause of panhypopituitarism with central DI.",M1
10971107,"Thickened pituitary stalk on magnetic resonance imaging in children with central diabetes insipidus.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed isolated pituitary stalk thickening (PST) in certain cases of idiopathic or secondary central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) due to infiltrative processes. Twenty-six children with DI and PST underwent cerebral MRI at the age of 8 +/- 4 years and were followed (n = 25) by clinical and MRI evaluation for 5.5 +/- 3.6 and 3.0 +/- 2 years, respectively, but given no treatment other than hormonal substitutive therapy. Patients were subdivided into groups according to the etiology of the DI: germinoma (n = 4), Langerhans' histiocytosis (n = 5) or 'idiopathic' DI with PST (n = 17). Complete anterior pituitary evaluation in 24 of the 26 patients revealed that 14 children were suffering from associated growth hormone deficiency and 7 had multiple hormone deficiencies. At the first MRI evaluation, pituitary stalk enlargement varied from 2.2 to 9.0 mm. The anterior pituitary gland was found to be normal (n = 12), small (n = 8) or enlarged (n = 6). At the final evaluation, a change in MRI features had occurred in 16 patients: morphological and/or signal changes in the PST (n = 16; 6 of whom showed an increase in PST) and changes in anterior pituitary gland size (n = 8; 3 of whom had increased and 5 had decreased). The presence of a growing suprasellar mass with a progressively enlarging pituitary stalk was demonstrated in the 6 patients who had shown increased pituitary stalk enlargement 1.8 +/- 1.6 years after the first MRI. In 4 of these patients, a diagnosis of germinoma was made 1.3 +/- 0.6 years after PST identification by MRI at the onset of DI, but the other 2 patients showing a suprasellar mass were still categorized as 'idiopathic' at the final clinical evaluation performed 7.8 and 12.3 years after DI onset. In 10 patients (all but 1 with Langerhans' histiocytosis, showing 'idiopathic' DI) the pituitary stalk enlargement was diminished after 2.0 +/- 1.9 years of MRI follow-up, and there was a complete reversal of pituitary stalk enlargement in 5 patients. We conclude that the natural history of 'idiopathic' isolated central DI with PST is unpredictable. Although germinoma should always be considered during the first 3 years of follow-up in patients presenting isolated DI with PST by repeated investigations every 3-6 months, it remains an infrequent etiology, affecting only 15% of cases in our study.",M1

He had polyuria (8-10 litres/day) and polydipsia for the previous 15 days, with no other symptoms. The dehydration test showed central DI (raised osmolarity following subcutaneous desmopresin). On MNR there were bilateral periventricular nodular images, also present in both caudate nuclei, with ring increased uptake following administration of paramagnetic contrast. On the clinical suspicion of cerebral toxoplasmosis empirical treatment was started with sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine together with nasal DDAVP, obtaining a good clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HIV infection, DI, although uncommon, may be the first sign of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Imaging studies may be pathological and assist diagnosis.",M1

In animals of the +2 genotype maintained under conditions of water deprivation, the content of 120 kDa protein increased significantly in inner medulla of the kidney over 3 days. No changes in the amount of this protein were observed in rats of the didi genotype under the same conditions. We suggest that the congenital inability of didi mutants to synthesize vasopressin accounts for the distinctions observed in the reactions of rats with different genotypes.",M1
10901882,"'Stalkitis' in a pregnant 32-year-old woman: a rare cause of diabetes insipidus.A case of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH) or 'stalkitis' in a 32-year-old woman who presented with diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) during pregnancy is reported here. The diagnosis was made with MR imaging. The clinical and radiological features of this rare disorder and the differential diagnosis of infundibular mass lesions are discussed. The differentiation from lymphocytic adenohypophysitis (LAH) is made. No improvement of the DI accompanying LINH is achieved with trans-sphenoidal surgery. Hence, recognition of typical cases with MR imaging and appropriate medical management avoids unnecessary neurosurgery. This is the second reported case of LINH associated with pregnancy and may suggest an association.",M1
10849214,"Processing of frameshifted vasopressin precursors.Biosynthesis of the vasopressin (VP) prohormone in magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system comprises endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transit, sorting into the regulated secretory pathway and subsequent processing in the individual proteins VP, neurophysin and a glycoprotein. These processes are severely disrupted in the homozygous diabetes insipidus (<e>di</e>/di) Brattleboro rat, which expresses a mutant VP precursor due to a single nucleotide deletion in the neurophysin region of the VP gene resulting in VP deficiency. Previous studies have shown the presence of additional frameshift mutations in VP transcripts, in solitary magnocellular neurones of the di/di rat due to a GA dinucleotide deletion resulting in two different mutant VP precursors with partly restored reading frame. Frameshifted VP precursors are also expressed in several magnocellular neurones in wild-type rats. In this study, we determined if the +1 frameshifted precursors from di/di and wild-type rats can lead to biosynthesis of the hormone VP. Therefore, eukaryotic expression plasmids containing the frameshifted VP cDNAs were transiently expressed in peptidergic tumour cell lines, and cells were analysed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassays, and by immunofluoresence. Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells expressing the +1 frameshifted precursors of di/di rats retained products in the cell body. Only precursor or insignificant quantities of neurophysin-immunoreactive products were detected. In contrast, in AtT20 cells, frameshifted VP precursors were at least partly processed to yield the VP peptide, indicating that they have access to the regulated secretory pathway. Comparison between the two cell lines showed a very slow ER transit of the wild-type prohormone combined with inefficient processing in Neuro2A cells. The results show that mutant precursors can reach the regulated secretory pathway if ER transport is sufficiently rapid as in the case of AtT20 cells. This suggests that the di/di rat may regain the capacity to biosynthesize authentic VP through these +1 frameshifted precursors in magnocellular neurones.",M1
10770168,"Hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities in adult patients with langerhans cell histiocytosis: clinical, endocrinological, and radiological features and response to treatment.Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder in which granulomatous deposits occur at multiple sites within the body, but which often involves the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (HPA). Although diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is a well recognized complication, the frequency of anterior pituitary and other nonendocrine hypothalamic (NEH) involvement has not been well defined, particularly in adult patients with the disease. We have evaluated the frequency and progression of LCH-related anterior pituitary and other NEH dysfunction and their responses to treatment in 12 adult patients with histologically proven LCH and DI. They were followed up for a median of 11.5 yr (range, 3-28 yr) after the diagnosis of DI was made. Study evaluations comprised clinical (including formal psychometric assessment where appropriate), basal and dynamic pituitary function tests, and radiology with computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Eleven patients received systemic treatment, and 5 patients received external beam radiotherapy confined to the HPA. The median age at diagnosis of DI was 34 yr (range, 2-47 yr); DI was the presenting symptom in four patients, whereas the remaining eight each developed DI 1-20 yr (median, 2 yr) after the diagnosis of LCH. Eight patients developed one or more anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies at a median of 4.5 yr (range, 2-22 yr) after the diagnosis of DI: GH deficiency developed in eight patients (median, 2 yr; range, 2-22 yr), FSH-LH deficiency in 7 patients (median, 7 yr; range, 2-22 yr), and TSH and ACTH deficiency in five patients (median, 10 yr; range, 3-16 and 3-19 yr), respectively; five patients developed panhypopituitarism. In addition, seven patients with anterior pituitary dysfunction also developed symptoms of other NEH dysfunctions at a median of 10 yr (range, 1-23 yr): five morbid obesity (body mass index, &gt;35), five short term memory deficits, four sleeping disorders, two disorders of thermoregulation, and one adipsia. All patients developed disease outside of the hypothalamus during the course of the study, and no fluctuation of disease activity in the HPA region was noted. Radiological examination of the HPA was abnormal in each of the eight patients with anterior pituitary involvement and in the seven patients with NEH dysfunction (one or more abnormalities): seven had thickening of the infundibulum, and one had hypothalamic and thalamic signal changes. All patients who had a magnetic resonance imaging scan had absence of the bright spot of the posterior pituitary on the T1-weighted sequences, and in four patients with DI and normal anterior pituitary function this was the only abnormality. The five patients who received radiotherapy to the HPA achieved a partial or complete radiological response, and there was no evidence of tumor progression in this region. No form of therapy, including chemotherapy, improved any established hormonal deficiencies or symptoms of NEH. In summary, in our adult patients with hypothalamic LCH and DI, anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies developed in 8 of 12 patients; these occurred over the course of 20 yr. They were frequently accompanied by structural changes of the HPA, although these were often subtle in nature. In addition, symptoms of NEH dysfunction developed in up to 90% of such patients and complicated management. Radiotherapy may be useful in achieving local control of tumor, but established anterior, posterior pituitary, and other NEH dysfunctions do not improve in response to current treatment protocols. Patients with LCH and DI, particularly those with multisystem disease and a structural lesion on radiology, should undergo regular and prolonged endocrine assessment to establish anterior pituitary deficiency and provide appropriate hormonal replacement.",M1
10768833,"Diabetes insipidus in a patient with a highly malignant B-cell lymphoma and stomatitis.A 37-year-old male patient with a diffuse pleomorphic B-cell-lymphoma, which has been diagnosed two month earlier with the primary site at the pterygopalatine fossa on both sides with infiltration of the clivus and cavernous sinus was referred to our hospital for continuation of the third course of CHOP chemotherapy. At admission he reported about a recent history of painful swallowing and intermittent substernal chest pain. Alleviation of the pain on swallowing and the chest pain was apparently only possible by drinking 10 to 15 l of cold coca cola throughout the day and night, a regimen that resulted in polyuria. Physical examination revealed extensive thrush stomatitis and soor esophagitis. Despite successful treatment with fluconazole, polydipsia continued unabated. The classic osmotic test of dehydration and exogenous vasopressin revealed hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). Basal hormones and stimulated endocrine function tests of the adenohypophysis were found to be normal. MRI-scan revealed lymphoma infiltration of the neurohypophysis. After the third course of CHOP chemotherapy the patient surprisingly recovered completely from his excessive thirst. The present report shows that clinical disorders such as thrush stomatitis can mask diabetes insipidus caused by an early relapsing lymphoma.",M1

A diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) was made, which turned out to be the first sign of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a balanced translocation between chromosome 3 and 12 t(3;12)(q26;p12). The patient was treated with standard induction chemotherapy and vasopressin. Before consolidation chemotherapy could be administered, deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed and leukemia relapsed. Rescue chemotherapy was started. This is the first report of an association between AML with t(3;12) and DI. Its possible pathogenesis is discussed with a review of the literature.",M1
10670763,"An elderly patient with transient diabetes insipidus associated with lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis.We present the eldest case ever reported of central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) associated with infundibulo-neurohypophysitis. A 77-year old woman, who complained of recent development of excessive thirst, polyuria and polydipsia, was referred to our hospital. The daily urine volume was markedly increased to 6 L. DDAVP administration effectively reduced urine volume and increased urine osmolality. The loading test using high-osmolar sodium chloride showed impaired excretion of vasopressin discordant with plasma osmolar changes. The anterior pituitary function was normal. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed thickening of the pituitary stalk and a lack of high-intensity signal of the neurohypophysis on T1-weighted images, suggestive of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis. The thickness of pituitary stalk on MRI improved 6 months later. DI was controlled with DDAVP for 40 days. This was followed by stabilization of the daily urine volume to less than 2.5 L without DDAVP. Our case is the eldest case of central DI associated with infundibulo-neurohypophysitis. The rapid remission of pituitary changes on MRI provides an insight that spontaneously partial remission of central DI may occur, resulting in transient polyuria and polydipsia.",M1
10614531,"Transient diabetes insipidus following Escherichia coli meningitis complicated by ventriculoperitoneal shunt.Although disorders of ADH secretion associated with meningitis are usually consistent with the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is an exceptional complication of meningitis. Transient DI as a complication of Escherichia coli (E. coli) meningitis due to ventriculoperitoneal shunt in an 18-month-old boy is presented. Blood and spinal fluid cultures yielded E. coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. The DI arose on the day 3 after admission and continued to the day 20. Treatment comprised cefotaxime, dexamethasone, fluid adjustment and vasopressin. The course of our case supports that in cases of bacterial meningitis, initial fluid restriction may occasionally result in dangerous conditions. Therefore, all children with bacterial meningitis should be followed closely not only in terms of SIADH but also DI. To our knowledge this is the first transient DI associated with E. coli-caused meningitis case reported.",M1
10564239,"Thiazide induces water absorption in the inner medullary collecting duct of normal and Brattleboro rats.The reduction of urinary volume after the use of thiazide in the treatment of diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) is known as the  paradoxical effect.  Since enhanced proximal solute and water reabsorption only partially account for the reduction in urinary volume, an additional diuretic effect on nephron terminal segments was postulated. Thus the aim of our work was to investigate the effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on water transport in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) of normal and Brattleboro rats. Osmotic water permeability (P(f)) and diffusional water permeability (P(dw)) were studied at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 by the in vitro microperfusion technique. In the absence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), HCTZ (10(-6) M) added to the perfused fluid enhanced P(f) from 6.36 +/- 0. 56 to 19.08 +/- 1.70 micro(m)/s (P &lt; 0.01) and P(dw) from 38.01 +/- 4.52 to 52.26 +/- 4.38 x10(-5) cm/s (P &lt; 0.01) in normal rats and also stimulated P(f) in Brattleboro rats from 3.53 +/- 1.41 to 11.16 +/- 1.13 micro(m)/s (P &lt; 0.01). Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) (10(-5) M) added to the bath fluid inhibited HCTZ-stimulated P(f) (in micro(m)/s) as follows: control, 16.93 +/- 2.64; HCTZ, 29.65 +/- 5.67; HCTZ+PGE(2), 10.46 +/- 1.84 (P &lt; 0.01); recovery, 16.77 +/- 4.07. These data indicate that thiazides enhance water absorption in IMCD from normal rats (in the absence of ADH) and from Brattleboro rats and that the HCTZ-stimulated P(f) was partially blocked by PGE(2). Thus we may conclude that the effect of thiazide in the treatment of DI occurs not only in the Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransport in the distal tubule but also in the IMCD.",M1
10468619,"Vasopressin contributes to hyperfiltration, albuminuria, and renal hypertrophy in diabetes mellitus: study in vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats.Diabetic nephropathy represents a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), and the origin of this complication is poorly understood. Vasopressin (VP), which is elevated in type I and type II DM, has been shown to increase glomerular filtration rate in normal rats and to contribute to progression of chronic renal failure in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. The present study was thus designed to evaluate whether VP contributes to the renal disorders of DM. Renal function was compared in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) lacking VP and in normal Long-Evans (LE) rats, with or without streptozotocin-induced DM. Blood and urine were collected after 2 and 4 weeks of DM, and creatinine clearance, urinary glucose and albumin excretion, and kidney weight were measured. Plasma glucose increased 3-fold in DM rats of both strains, but glucose excretion was approximately 40% lower in DI-DM than in LE-DM, suggesting less intense metabolic disorders. Creatinine clearance increased significantly in LE-DM (P &lt; 0.01) but failed to increase in DI-DM. Urinary albumin excretion more than doubled in LE-DM but rose by only 34% in DI-DM rats (P &lt; 0.05). Kidney hypertrophy was also less intense in DI-DM than in LE-DM (P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that VP plays a critical role in diabetic hyperfiltration and albuminuria induced by DM. This hormone thus seems to be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy and, thus, a potential target for prevention and/or therapeutic intervention.",M1
10460010,"MRI detection of suprasellar germinoma causing central diabetes insipidus.This is a case report of an 18-year-old man with central diabetes incipidus (<e>DI</e>). An MRI done three months after the onset of the DI did not disclose a responsible lesion. Four months later, a second MRI showed the location of the tumor origin at the upper pituitary stalk and median eminence. Eight months later, the tumor occupied the hypothalamic area. The tumor became large and contrast-making enough to be visible on MRI between 3 and 4 months after the onst of DI. Besides the suprasellar tumor, another mass was noted in the pineal region. The growth pattern of the latter mass corresponded well to that of the former. Although the MRI is a sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of intracranial tumors, no adequate rationale has been given as to how the MRI might be repeated for children and adolescents who have been diagnosed as having the central DI, when their initial MRIs may have been normal. In our patient, the superconductive thin slice MRI revealed the suprasellar germinoma 4 months after the onset. The suprasellar and pineal tumors in this report originated and developed simultaneously. This may indicate a multi-center origin of the tumor. Another possibility is a very early dissemination from the onset of the tumor development.",M1
10435855,"Plasma leptin levels in male patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus.Leptin is known to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Moreover, recent studies in rodents have shown that leptin in high doses decreases urine osmolality and increases water intake, together with renal sodium and water excretion. Since it is not clear whether leptin is involved in either the pathogenesis or in resulting metabolic abnormalities in diabetes insipidus, we measured leptin levels in 16 male patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) in comparison to a group of age- and BMI-matched male control subjects (no.=30). We found that plasma leptin concentration did not differ between patients with DI (4.45+/-3.24 microg/l) and healthy control group (3.69+/-2.81 microg/l; t test, p=0.41). Urine osmolality, plasma osmolality and urine volume of the patients with DI was not correlated to leptin. However, leptin was positively associated with body mass index (r=0.67; p=0.005). We conclude that leptin plasma concentrations are unchanged in diabetes insipidus. Furthermore, the lack of correlation between plasma leptin and urine osmolality, plasma osmolality or urine volume suggests that ADH deficiency does not have any impact on the plasma leptin levels.",M1
10411354,"Hypercalcemia accompanied by hypothalamic hypopituitarism, central diabetes inspidus and hyperthyroidism.We present here a case of prominent hypercalcemia accompanied by hypothalamic tumor and Graves' disease. A 24-year-old man with hypothalamic tumor showed hypopituitarism, central diabetes inspidus (<e>DI</e>) and hyperthyroidism. Nausea, loss of thirst and appetite, and general fatigue were found with the unveiling of hypercalcemia and hypernatremia. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1alpha-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were suppressed with a normal range of PTH-related protein values. One-desamino-(8-D-arginine)-vasopressin (DDAVP) and half-saline administration normalized hypernatremia, while hypercalcemia was still sustained. Administration of cortisone acetate and thiamazole reduced the elevated serum Ca level. In the present case, concurrent hyperthyroidism was assumed to accelerate skeletal mobilization of calcium into the circulation. Hypocortisolism and central DI was also considered to contribute, to some extent, to the hypercalcemia through renal handling of Ca.",M1
10372693,"Thickened pituitary stalk on magnetic resonance imaging in children with central diabetes insipidus.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed isolated pituitary stalk (PS) thickening (PST) in certain cases of idiopathic or secondary central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) due to infiltrative processes. Twenty-six children with DI and PST underwent cerebral MRI at the age of 8 +/- 4 yr and were followed (n = 24) by clinical and MRI evaluation, respectively, for 5.5 +/- 3.6 and 3.0 +/- 2 yr in the absence of any treatment other than hormonal substitutive therapy. Patients were subdivided into groups according to the etiology of the DI: germinoma (n = 4), Langerhans' histiocytosis (n = 5), or idiopathic DI with PST (n = 17). Complete anterior pituitary evaluation for 24 of the 26 patients revealed those suffering from associated GH deficiency (n = 14; with germinoma, n = 1; histiocytosis, n = 3; idiopathic, n = 10) and from multiple hormone deficiencies (n = 7; with germinoma, n = 3; histiocytosis, n = 1; idiopathic, n = 3). At the first MRI evaluation, PS enlargement varied from 2.2-9.0 mm at a proximal (n = 10), distal (n = 2), or middle (n = 6) PS level or along the entire PS (n = 8). The intrasellar content, which usually reflects the anterior pituitary gland, was normal (n = 12), small (n = 8), or enlarged (n = 6). At the last evaluation, a change in MRI features was found in 16 patients; morphological and/or signal changes in the PST (n = 16, of whom 6 showed an increase in PST) and changes in anterior pituitary gland size (n = 8; increased, n = 3; decreased, n = 5) were noted. The presence of a growing suprasellar mass with progressively enlarging PS was demonstrated in the 6 patients who had shown increased PS enlargement 1.8 +/- 1.6 yr after the first MRI. For 4 of them, a diagnosis of germinoma was made 1.3 +/- 0.6 yr after PST identification by MRI performed after the onset of DI, but the other 2 patients showing a suprasellar mass were still categorized as idiopathic at the final clinical evaluation performed 7.8 and 12.3 yr, respectively, after DI onset. In 10 patients (all but 1 with Langerhans histiocytosis, showing idiopathic DI), the PS enlargement was diminished after 2.0 +/- 1.9 yr of MRI follow-up, with a complete reversal of PS enlargement for 5 of them. Suprasellar mass invasion of the PS was related to multiple hormone deficiency. Although intrasellar content enlargement was observed in most patients with germinoma, a normal or small anterior pituitary gland showed no clear relationship to either clinical histories or laboratory values. In conclusion, the natural history of idiopathic isolated central DI with PST is unpredictable. Although germinoma should always be considered during the first 3 yr of follow-up in patients showing isolated DI with PST requiring repeated investigations every 3-6 months, it remains a less frequent etiology for 15% of the cases.",M1
10206125,"Lymphocytic hypophysitis with central diabetes insipidus and consequent panhypopituitarism preceding a multifocal, intracranial germinoma in a prepubertal girl.We report the clinical course of a prepubertal girl with central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>) and consequent panhypopituitarism evolving over a period of 10 years due to lymphocytic hypophysitis and subsequent germinoma. Two years after the diagnosis of central DI was established, MRI revealed a thickened pituitary stalk. Later pituitary enlargement and increasing thickening of the pituitary stalk impinging on the optic chiasm required a trans-sphenoidal biopsy which disclosed active hypophysitis with lymphocytic infiltrates and necrosis. High dose dexamethasone treatment only temporarily halted the disease process. Therefore, stereotactic radiation therapy was performed as a rescue treatment and MRI findings almost reversed. However, the subsequent MRI showed multiple intracranial lesions identified histologically as a germinoma and a standard chemotherapy and radiation was performed. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of diabetes insipidus in children requires long-term follow up beyond the pubertal age in order to establish the underlying cause. In contrast to lymphocytic hypophysitis in adults, lymphocytic hypophysitis in prepubertal children may represent the first sign of a host reaction to an occult germinoma.",M1
9829222,"Suprasellar germinomas in childhood and adolescence: diagnostic pitfalls.The clinical and neuro-endocrine data of seven young male patients with suprasellar germinomas seen between 1984 and 1992 are reported. The most common initial symptom was 'idiopathic' central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>), which occurred in all seven patients. The time interval between the appearance of this first clinical sign and the definitive diagnosis of a suprasellar germinoma ranged from 3 to 66 months. Raised prolactin levels and growth hormone deficiency were indicators of a process located in the hypothalamic-pituitary region. An increased beta-HCG level in the serum or the CSF confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of a germinoma and was helpful as a tumor marker in follow-up. Neuro-radiologic studies (CT or MRI) were also disappointing in the early stage when patients presented only with DI. Later on, as patients developed additional symptoms or signs related to the tumor, imaging studies were positive. Given the variable rate of tumor progression, the nonspecific early signs of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (DI) as well as the often negative early imaging studies, the diagnosis of suprasellar germinoma is difficult but should always be considered in the presence of so-called 'idiopathic' central DI. Repeated brain MRIs are mandatory in young patients with idiopathic DI in order not to miss an underlying suprasellar germinoma.",M1

This retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence, profile and outcome of patients admitted to an 18-bedded neurosurgical intensive care unit who developed DI. The overall incidence was 3.7% (29/792 admissions). Aetiologies included subarachnoid haemorrhage (12/29), severe head injury (11/29), post-surgical excision of craniopharyngioma or pituitary adenoma (5/29) and acute haemorrhagic stroke (1/29). All patients were treated with a regime of fluid replacement, electrolyte correction, parenteral or intranasal desmopressin (DDAVP), or parenteral pitressin. Overall mortality was 72.4%. There were no deaths in the patients who underwent excision of tumours. Complications included acute pulmonary oedema, hypernatremia and hypokalaemia. The development of DI was found to be associated with impending brain death and mortality in the majority of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and severe head injury.

In this study, 10 patients with complete (4) and partial (6) type central DI were found among 125 LCH patients in our hospital records. The water deprivation test, followed by the pitressin test, was performed to confirm DI. Hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine function tests were carried out on these 10 patients at the initial diagnosis and during follow-up. All patients revealed growth hormone insufficiency in the insulin hypoglycemic tolerance test. Four patients had impairment of cortisol secretion, demonstrated by insulin hypoglycemic stimulating test results. Two patients had poor response in the thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulating test. Two patients had only partial responses in the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone test. Four patients had hyperprolactinemia. All patients underwent surgical treatment followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. One patient completely recovered from the endocrine disorder, 3 patients required smaller doses of desmopressin, and one patient had normal adrenal, thyroid, and gonadal function. Hypothalamic-pituitary disorders in LCH should not be neglected. Treatment of LCH can partially or completely reverse associated endocrine disorders.

9748751,"[Disturbances of effective osmolality regulation in disorders of the central nervous system and possible methods of monitoring]Authors deal in detail with the pathophysiology of the osmolal regulation. Besides hyperosmolality the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in increased by hypovolemia and hypotension. Secretion of ADH is lowered in hypoosmolal states. All other mechanisms are preferebly volume regulating and they influence mainly retention and excretion of sodium. Authors discuss homeostatic effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, effects of renal failure with prevailing glomerular or tubular function disorder, impact of diuretics, natriuretic peptides, digitalis-like hormone, urodilantin and influence of the other solutes. Disorders of the effective osmolality regulation are frequent in the cerebral affections that originate from trauma, vascular disease, inflammation or tumors. Hypoosmolality and hyponatremia are presented in two different conditions: Inappropriate Vasopressin Secretion Syndrome (IADHS) and Cerebral Salt Wasting Syndrome (CSWS). Quick differential diagnose is important because the treatment of both syndromes is essentially different. Typical cause of hypernatremia is central diabetes insipidus (<e>DI</e>). The group of available calculated renal function parameters is applied in the differential diagnosis of these syndromes. They are creatinin clearance, excretion fraction of water and sodium, electrolyte clearance and electrolyte free water clearance. Investigation of ADH and natriuretic peptide could be even misleading. Pathophysiologic consequence of the state given by inappropriate elevation of one hormone can be the elevation of the second one.",M1

Both patients had DI with typical clinical and laboratory findings. The first patient died early on during reinduction chemotherapy and the second patient died of intracranial bleeding before induction chemotherapy was given. These findings are consistent with the data in the literature suggesting that the prognosis of AML associated with DI is poor and that these cases generally present with hyperleucocytosis.",M1

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) likewise has negative effects on electrolyte balance. If ovulation induction is required in a patient with DI, there is thus a strong argument for avoiding techniques that increase the risk of OHSS. This paper reports the results of ovulation induction in a patient with anovulation of hypothalamic origin and central (vasopressin deficit) DI. Ovulation was induced with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which induces single-ovule cycles and which does not increase the risk of OHSS. The patient successfully achieved pregnancy after seven ovulatory cycles.",M1
19217060,"Evaluation of flow cytometric immunophenotyping and DNA analysis for detection of malignant cells in serosal cavity fluids.The serosal cavities are frequent sites of tumor metastasis. The distinction between carcinoma cells, inflammatory cells, and reactive or malignant mesothelial cells can be difficult in cytology. Multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) provides the opportunity to evaluate multiple antigens simultaneously, making it possible to characterize various cell populations. In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FCM immunophenotyping and DNA in comparison with serum tumor markers and classic cytology for detection of malignant cells in pleural and ascitic fluids. One hundred and nineteen samples of body cavity fluids were analyzed. Immunophenotyping was performed by four-color immunofluorescent staining using monoclonal antibodies against Ber-EP4, cytokeratin, CD3, and CD45. The DNA analysis by FCM was also performed. In addition, serum CA19-9, CEA, AFP, and CA125 were analyzed. Ber-EP4 marker had the highest sensitivity (73%) and specificity (95.5%) in the detection of carcinoma cells in serous fluid and correlated with cytology in most of cases (73%). The mean of <e>DI</e> differed statistically in patients with malignant effusions than in benign one. DI showed no difference in fluids due to infiltration of malignant epithelial cells or hematopoietic malignancy or due to hepatocellular carcinoma developing in cirrhotic liver. Thus, flow cytometry appears to aid not only in the detection of malignant cells but also in the characterization of cell type. On the other hand, although DNA ploidy examination had better sensitivity; it had no advantage over conventional cytopathological examination in identification of malignant cells.",M2
18670357,"DNA ploidy abnormalities in basal and superficial regions of the crypts in Barrett's esophagus and associated neoplastic lesions.The purpose of this study was to define the zonal DNA content distribution in the basal versus the superficial crypt cells in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and related neoplastic lesions. One hundred and five tissue sections of BE patients and 12 gastric tissue section as controls were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Feulgen and high-fidelity DNA histograms were generated from whole crypts (n=117) and also separately from the basal and superficial portions of the crypts (n=71). Three parameters were analyzed: (1) peak DNA index (<e>DI</e>), classified into diploidy (DI=0.9-1.1) or aneuploidy (DI&gt;1.1), the latter of which was further divided into 3 types: mild (DI=1.1-1.3), moderate (DI=1.3-1.8), and severe (DI&gt;1.8). (2) Heterogeneity index (HI), representing groups of cells with different DNA content. (3) Percentage of cells with DI exceeding 5N rate (5N-ER). In full crypts, compared with gastric controls, the prevalence of DNA aneuploidy increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) from nondysplastic BE to basal crypt dysplasia (BCD), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and adenocarcinoma (AC). Nondysplastic BE, BCD, and LGD had mostly mild aneuploidy, and the majority of HGD and AC had either moderate or severe aneuploidy. In addition, both HI and 5N-ER increased progressively from BCD and LGD to HGD and AC (P&lt;0.01). When analyzed separately, the superficial crypt cells were diploid in nondysplastic BE and BCD, but were aneuploid in 50% of LGD and 100% of HGD cases. In contrast, basal crypt cells were aneuploid in 37% of nondysplastic BE, 50% of BCD, 73% of LGD, and 100% of HGD cases. A similar progressive increase in the HI and 5N-ER values in basal crypt cells was observed with dysplastic progression. The changes in DNA ploidy profiles of basal crypt cells in BCD and LGD were remarkably similar. These results suggest that with neoplastic progression, dysplastic changes in BE begin in the basal crypt cells and then extend further up the crypts, and BCD represents a true early form of dysplasia limited to the crypt bases.",M2
18196464,"Expressed sequence tag analysis and development of gene associated markers in a near-isogenic plant system of Eragrostis curvula.Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees is a forage grass native to the semiarid regions of Southern Africa, which reproduces mainly by pseudogamous diplosporous apomixis. A collection of ESTs was generated from four cDNA libraries, three of them obtained from panicles of near-isogenic lines with different ploidy levels and reproductive modes, and one obtained from 12 days-old plant leaves. A total of 12,295 high-quality ESTs were clustered and assembled, rendering 8,864 unigenes, including 1,490 contigs and 7,394 singletons, with a genome coverage of 22%. A total of 7,029 (79.11%) unigenes were functionally categorized by BLASTX analysis against sequences deposited in public databases, but only 37.80% could be classified according to Gene Ontology. Sequence comparison against the cereals genes indexes (GI) revealed 50% significant hits. A total of 254 EST-SSRs were detected from 219 singletons and 35 from contigs. <e>Di</e>- and tri- motifs were similarly represented with percentages of 38.95 and 40.16%, respectively. In addition, 190 SNPs and Indels were detected in 18 contigs generated from 3 to 4 libraries. The ESTs and the molecular markers obtained in this study will provide valuable resources for a wide range of applications including gene identification, genetic mapping, cultivar identification, analysis of genetic diversity, phenotype mapping and marker assisted selection.",M2
17947464,"Hyperdiploidy is a common finding in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and monosomy 13 is restricted to these hyperdiploid patients.PURPOSE: Two pathways, hyperdiploid and nonhyperdiploid, are proposed for progression to plasma cell neoplasia. Implication of monosomy 13 (Delta13) is unclear in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and data on DNA content of plasma cells [DNA index (<e>DI</e>)] are rare. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We ascertained DI in 169 multiple myeloma (MM) and 96 MGUS patients. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled to cytoplasmic staining of specific Ig (cIg-FISH) was done to look for trisomies and to ascertain Delta13. RESULTS: Hyperdiploidy and hypodiploidy were found in 54% and 11.5% of MGUS patients and in 59.5% and 25% of MM patients, respectively. In MGUS patients tested using probes for odd chromosomes, cIg-FISH showed association between trisomies for chromosomes 3, 7, 9, 11, or 15 and hyperdiploidy. Delta13 was found in 45.3% and 24.6% of MM and MGUS patients, respectively. Most Delta13 cases observed in MGUS were found within hyperdiploid clones, 38% versus 11% in hypodiploid cases, in sharp contrast with the occurrence of Delta13 in MM patients, 31.9% and 76.3%, respectively. That peculiar distribution of Delta13 according to DI persisted with other thresholds used to ascertain hyperdiploidy, such as DI &gt;or= 1.05. A strong relationship between IgA peak and hypodiploidy (P = 0.007) was only observed in MM, whereas lambda light chain was significantly associated with hypodiploidy in MGUS (P = 0.001) and MM (P = 0.05). Hyperdiploidy shows similar pattern in MGUS and MM. CONCLUSION: This fits well a hyperdiploid pathway leading to MM after a preceding MGUS stage. Yet-to-be-determined secondary event(s) needs to occur for the transition to MM, unrelated to changes in chromosome number or to loss of chromosome 13. In contrast, the  nonhyperdiploid  pathway needs to be clarified further because hypodiploidy is less common in MGUS than in MM and Delta13 is rare in hypodiploid MGUS patients compared with hypodiploid MM patients.",M2
17559500,"DNA ploidy analysis in salivary gland tumours by image cytometry.AIM: To determine whether DNA ploidy by image cytometry is a good diagnostic tool to distinguish benign and malignant salivary gland tumours. METHODS: A total of 62 salivary gland tumours were studied. Cases were histologically diagnosed [haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, there were 14 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC), 11 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC), 10 pleomorphic adenomas (PA), 10 carcinoma ex PA (CEPA), 9 acinic cell carcinomas (ACCa), 3 polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas (PLGA), 2 papillary cystadenocarcinomas (PC), 1 myoepithelial carcinoma (MC), 1 undifferentiated carcinoma (UC) and 1 mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA). Paraffin sections (40 microm) were micro-dissected to isolate tumour areas; cell nuclei were extracted and Feulgen-stained cytospin monolayers were analysed using a DNA image cytometry system. For each case, DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was calculated relative to internal controls (lymphocytes; DI=1.0). Cases were categorized as diploid or aneuploid and the proportion of cells over 5c was also calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-three of 62 salivary gland tumours were uniformly diploid. Only nine cases were aneuploid: five CEPA, one low-grade MEC, one PC, one UC and one MA. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of salivary gland tumours were diploid. High-grade malignancies may be aneuploid, and ploidy may be useful to identify malignant change in atypical PA. Further, larger studies are needed to confirm our results and to further evaluate the usefulness of the technique in high-grade lesions.",M2
17390052,"Hypoploidy defines patients with poor prognosis in breast cancer.The clinicopathological features currently used in breast cancer prognosis often fail to characterize the clinical heterogeneity of the disease accurately. Our study is aimed to investigate the predictive value of DNA flow cytometry in breast cancer. Previously untreated breast carcinoma samples (584) were snap frozen for flow-cytometry. Tumors were classified into three DNA index (<e>DI</e>) categories: i) tumors showing a DI =0.96-1.15 (diploid and near-diploid); ii) tumors with a DI &gt;or=1.16 (hyperdiploid, tetraploid, multiploid and/or those with more than one diploid population); and iii) tumors with a DI &lt;or=0.95 (hypoploid). The 5- and 10-year cumulative survival rates +/- SE for Group I (n=191) were 98+/-1% and 98+/-1%. For Group II (n=361) these rates were 77+/-2% at 5 years and 63+/-5% at 10 years. In Group III (n=32) the rate at 5 years was 23+/-8%, with no patients alive at 10 years (p&lt;0.0001). In univariate analysis, tumor size, node status, grade, karyometry, S-phase fraction, MIB-1 index, and estrogen receptors retained prognostic significance; in multivariate analysis, only DI &lt;or=0.95 (hypoploid) was retained as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Our data strongly support that DNA hypoploid has a strong, independent prognostic value for predicting the short-term clinical outcome of breast carcinoma patients.",M2
17113721,"Prognostic impact of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) image analysis cytometry and immunohistochemical expression of Ki67 in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers.BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of DNA ploidy and Ki67 expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). METHODS: This prospective study included 96 patients with stages I-IIIA NSCLC who underwent surgical excision. DNA image analysis cytometry was applied on imprints. Calculation of the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and the 5c exceeding rate (5cER) was performed and the histograms were classified as peridiploid, peritetraploid, and x-ploid-multiploid. The Ki67 immunoreactivity was determined according to the avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method. RESULTS: DNA histogram classification disclosed 30 peridiploid cases, 15 peritetraploid and 51 x-ploid-multiploid. Forty-eight cases (50%) had 5cER &gt; 5%. The Ki67 immunoreactivity was below 25% in 53 tumors (62.4%) and above 25% in 32 (32.6%). Our results revealed the existence of a statistically significant relationship of DNA ploidy with nodal status (p = 0.042) and grade (p = 0.005). Adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas were more frequently encountered in x-ploid-multiploid tumors as compared to squamous cell carcinomas, which were more frequently peridiploid (p = 0.003). 5cER showed statistically significant association with nodal status (p = 0.037). Univariate analysis with respect to survival revealed significant association with stage (p &lt; 0.001), nodal status (p &lt; 0.001), tumor status (p &lt; 0.001), DNA ploidy (p = 0.008) and 5cER (p = 0.0124). Multivariate analysis revealed stage and ploidy status as independent factors: peridiploid tumors were associated with better survival as compared to x-ploid-multiploid tumors (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DNA ploidy, as determined by image analysis, provides an independent prognostic parameter for patients with NSCLC and thus, could be used to identify a subset of patients with more aggressive tumors.",M2
16832620,"Gynogenic plant regeneration from unpollinated flower explants of Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter.Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is the most important cereal in Ethiopia. In its wild relative E. mexicana, regeneration of six green plants resulted from culture of 121 non-pollinated immature pistils. In the allotetraploid crop species tef, however, only callus and root formation was obtained by this method. By contrast, immature spikelets and panicle segments of E. tef proved amenable to gynogenic plant regeneration. Upon step-wise optimization of the protocol, efficient plant formation was achieved in all three cultivars tested. In cv. DZ-01-196, culture of 1305 immature spikelets resulted in formation of 159 green plants. Flow cytometric analysis revealed (<e>di</e>)haploid, triploid, tetraploid and octoploid regenerants, from which the vast majority was tetraploid. Tef-breeding programs will likely benefit substantially from efficient generation of true-breeding plants.",M2
16685384,"Relation of DNA ploidy to genetic aberrations detected by chromosomal CGH and FISH in gastric adenocarcinomas.We analyzed DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) by chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in 93 consecutive sporadic gastric adenocarcinomas. In addition, numerical aberrations in chromosomes 7, 11, 17, and 18 were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Gastric cancers were divided on the basis of nuclear DNA content measured by laser scanning cytometry (LSC) into two groups, 36 DNA diploid (1.0 &lt;or= DNA index (<e>DI</e>) &lt; 1.2) and 57 aneuploid (DI &gt;or= 1.2) cancers. The most frequent gain and loss of DNA copy number were found at 8q21-23 and 19p13.3, respectively, in both diploid and aneuploid cancers. Diploid cancers were further divided on the basis of genetic aberrations into major type and subtype cancers. The diploid cancer group included nine subtype cancers that showed large numbers of DCNAs; the mean number of DCNAs detected by CGH was 26.7 per tumor. This value was much larger in these diploid subtype cancers than diploid major type cancers (mean, 5.2 per tumor, p&lt;0.0001). These nine cancers were also characterized by large intercellular variations in chromosome copy numbers that were not detected in the 27 major diploid type cancers. The aneuploid cancer group included only three subtype tumors that showed only a small number of DCNAs (mean, 3 per tumor) and minimal intercellular variations in chromosomal copy number. These data indicate that gastric adenocarcinomas can be divided into three types; aneuploid, major diploid type and diploid subtype cancers. Large-scale studies are necessary to clarify the differences in biological characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms between these types.",M2
16637385,"[Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)]Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN1-3) and Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) putative precursors of and associated to pancreatic cancer represent a distinct, however pathologically heterogenous entity. Recently a new classification and nomenclature was established. We analysed the clinicopathologic and cytogenetic characteristics of six patients with PanIN and two with IPMN undergoing curative surgical resection. The most valuable tool in the diagnosis of these preinvasive neoplasms is ERCP combined with brush cytology. Conventional laboratory blood tests, tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9) were within normal values and imaging modalities were informative in only one third of the cases, however, not pathognostic. Based on our hypothesis that tumor ploidy pattern correlates with biological behaviour, malignant potential and prognosis, we measured the nuclear DNA content, ploidy, synthetic (S) phase or proliferative fractions of each neoplasm by flow cytometry. Each neoplasm demonstrated diploid stemline, with a low mean S-phase or proliferative fraction (3,77%) and mean DNA index (<e>DI</e>) of 0.96. The diploid DNA pattern and the low proliferative activity are consistent with the nonaggressive biological behavior of intraepithelial and intraductal neoplasms and, in part, explain their favorable prognosis.",M2
16059642,"The DNA ploidy and proliferative activity of transplantable melanoma cells in regard to their secretory function.The study concerns DNA ploidy and proliferative activity of the cells of two hamster transplantable melanoma lines - differing in many biological features - in the light of possible changes in their secretory activity. DNA ploidy was determined from the index of propidium iodide (PI) stained DNA content (<e>DI</e>), while the proliferative activity was defined as the percentage of cells in S and G2/M cell cycle phases. The secretory activity was described by determining total protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and nitric oxide (NO) content in the supernatants after 1, 6, 24 and 48 hours in cell culture. Our results indicate that melanotic melanoma cells (Ma) have a near-tetraploid DNAcontent and about 18% of proliferating cells, while amelanotic melanoma cells (Ab) - have a near-triploid DNA content and almost twice as many proliferating cells. The Ab cells, in comparison with Ma cells, secreted in vitro less total protein and most of the cytokines examined except OSM, but a spontaneous alteration of transplantable melanoma was accompanied by an increase of the quantity and dynamics of NO secretion. So, the cells of two melanoma lines have their own characteristic pattern of secretory function. But, the aneuploidy which accompanied the changes in cell differentiation of the studied melanoma lines, although seemed to reflect their changes in the proliferative activity, nevertheless did not reflect, in a direct way, differences in the secretion of the substances studied.",M2
15827757,"DNA content heterogeneity in neuroblastoma analyzed by means of image cytometry and its potential significance.The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and significance of the tumor DNA content heterogeneity in 33 previously untreated human neuroblastomas. We used image cytometry to selectively analyze neuroblasts by excluding karyorrhectic or stromal cells from cytometric measurements. DNA content heterogeneity with more than one clonal subpopulation on DNA histogram was found in 8 of 33 cases. Of these 8 cases, 4 showed MYCN amplification. Double labeling fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes for the centromeric region of chromosome 2 and MYCN gene was used to confirm the DNA content heterogeneity. DNA content heterogeneity was associated with poorer prognosis in this study (P&lt;0.05). There was a significant correlation between euploidy (<e>di</e>- and tetraploidy) and worse prognosis, but only when heterogeneous neuroblastomas with euploid cell population were assigned to euploid tumors (P=0.006). Our results may explain the conflicting data in the literature regarding ploidy and suggest that DNA content heterogeneity and the presence of a euploid population may predict worse prognosis in neuroblastoma patients.",M2
12809927,"DNA cytometric features in biopsies of TaT1 urothelial cell cancer predict recurrence and stage progression more accurately than stage, grade, or treatment modality.OBJECTIVES: To compare retrospectively the predictive value for recurrence and stage progression of DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction by flow cytometry and highly automated ultrafast image cytometry (ICM) in biopsies of TaT1 urothelial cell carcinomas (UCCs) of the urinary bladder with stage, grade, other pathologic features, and treatment. METHODS: Three experienced pathologists reviewed the stage and grade of 228 UCCs; 193 (85%) consensus cases were analyzed further. We had enough material for single-cell suspensions for both flow cytometry and ICM in 183 cases (94.8%). The 2001 European Society for Analytical Cellular Pathology standards for DNA ICM were followed. The predictive value of DNA features, classic prognosticators (stage, grade, carcinoma in situ, multicentricity), and treatment modality for recurrence and stage progression were analyzed with univariate (Kaplan-Meier) survival and multivariate (Cox model) regression analysis. Ta and T1 cases were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Of the 228 cases, 88 (51.5%) recurred and 13 (7.6%) progressed. On univariate analysis, most of the DNA features studied were statistically significant. Treatment modality and grade were only prognostic for progression (not for recurrence) and only in Ta cases. On multivariate analysis, DNA ICM features performed best; the strongest recurrence predictor for Ta UCC was a DNA index (<e>DI</e>) of 1.0 versus all others, and for T1 UCC, a DI of less than 1.3 versus 1.3 or greater. The best stage progression predictor for Ta UCCs was a DI of 1.0 plus an S-phase fraction of less than 10%, and for T1 UCCs, a DI of less than 1.3 versus 1.3 or greater. With multivariate analysis, sex, age, grade, carcinoma in situ, multicentricity, and treatment modality were excluded once the DNA ICM features were selected. CONCLUSIONS: DNA image cytometric features predict recurrence and stage progression in TaT1 UCC biopsies more accurately than classic prognostic factors, independent of treatment modality.",M2
12775919,"Correlation of grade of urothelial cell carcinomas and DNA histogram features assessed by flow cytometry and automated image cytometry.OBJECTIVE: To analyse how DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) by flow cytometry (FCM) and an optimised fully automatic DNA image cytometer (ICM) correlate with grade in TaT1 urothelial cell carcinomas (UC) of the urinary bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred-and twenty-eight consensus cases were analysed. Single cell suspensions were stained (DAPI for FCM, Feulgen for ICM). There was enough material for both FCM and ICM in 202 of these cases. FCM and optimised ICM measurements were performed on the 202 UCs. To discriminate between different grades, single- and multivariate analyses was performed on DNA histogram features obtained with the MultiCycle program (using DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and SPF). RESULTS: Overall measurement time of the adapted ICM method was 10.7 minutes per case (range 5.9-29.8 min.) and required little additional interactive object rejection (average 152 objects (84-298) on 3000 objects per case measured, which took 9.9 minutes on average, range 8.3-15.5 minutes). The ICM histograms looked much  cleaner  with less noise than the FCM graphs. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the diploid peak for ICM (5.4%) was significantly lower than for FCM (5.9%) (p&lt;0.0001). ICM features were more strongly correlated to grade than FCM features. In multivariate analysis, the best discriminating set of features was DNA ploidy and SPF (both by ICM). CONCLUSIONS: The adapted fully automated DNA ICM works very well for UCs. Low CV DNA ICM histograms are obtained in a time comparable to FCM. The DNA ICM results have stronger discriminative power than DNA FCM for grade in TaT1 UCs.",M2
12754737,"Analysis of genetic alterations, classified according to their DNA ploidy pattern, in the progression of colorectal adenomas and early colorectal carcinomas.DNA aneuploidy is a biological marker of the oncogenic potential of colorectal adenomas. The accumulation of genetic alterations of cancer-related genes is also essential for colorectal carcinogenesis. However, it is unclear whether there is any relationship between these genetic alterations and the DNA ploidy of colon tumour cells in the progression of colorectal adenomas and early colorectal carcinomas. Here we have studied the DNA ploidy state and genetic alterations occurring in colorectal tumours using the crypt isolation technique. Crypts isolated from a total of 106 colorectal tumors (adenoma, 93; early carcinoma, 13) were examined using a combination of flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, polymerase chain reaction-microsatellite assay, and single-strand conformation polymorphism assay for evidence of chromosomal allelic imbalance (AI; 17p; 5q; 18q) or p53 gene mutation. In addition, we examined microsatellite instability (MSI) with BAT 26 primer sets. DNA multiploidy was infrequently detected in colorectal adenomas (15.1%), in contrast to early carcinomas (46.2%). There was a significant difference in the incidence of AI of chromosome 18q between diploid adenomas and aneuploid populations of multiploid adenomas (18.1% vs 57.1%, p = 0.0043). Mutation of p53 was also found more frequently in aneuploid populations of early multiploid colorectal carcinomas than in early diploid colorectal carcinomas (66.7% vs 0%, p = 0.021). MSI was found in only 2 of 93 adenomas, with no MSI detected in early colorectal cancers. The two MSI-positive adenomas were diploid. We subdivided multiploid adenomas into two groups: those with a low or a high DNA index (<e>DI</e>). The incidence of genetic alterations of high-DI adenomas did not differ from those of low-DI adenomas. Allelic imbalance involving loci on chromosome 18q and mutations of p53 seems to be associated with the progression of diploidy to multiploidy in colorectal tumours. On the other hand, MSI may be associated with the development of some diploid tumours. In addition, the incidence of genetic alterations in the colorectal adenomas that we examined appears to be independent of the tumour's DNA index.",M2
12717687,"Slide-based cytometry for predicting malignancy in solid salivary gland tumors by fine needle aspirate biopsies.BACKGROUND: To minimize hospitalization and morbidity for a patient with a solid tumor of a salivary gland, malignancy must be confirmed or excluded as soon as possible. This information cannot be obtained preoperatively by existing standard procedures. Minimal-invasive approaches with adequate diagnostic analysis represent a promising precondition for optimized therapy. METHODS: For fine needle aspirate biopsies (FNABs), laser scanning cytometry (LSC) offers a semi-automated slide-based technology for objective and quantitative analysis. We have established an assay for FNABs from salivary gland tumors. FNAB cells were stained for cytokeratin and DNA followed by LSC analysis. The cells were subsequently HE-stained and were relocalized on the slide. The LSC analysis quantitatively determines the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) of the tumor cells taking leukocytes as internal DNA diploid standard. Histograms with 0.95 &lt; DI &lt; 1.05 and 1.9 &lt;DI &lt;2.1 were defined as DNA euploid, whereas any other DI was defined as DNA aneuploid. The percentage of cytokeratin positive cells with DI &gt; 2.5 (i.e., 5c exceeding rate, 5cER) was calculated. Samples with DNA aneuploid peaks or with 5cER &gt; 5% were classified as malignant. Routine histopathology was performed as a control. RESULTS: FNABs from 51 solid salivary gland tumors (41 parotid gland, six submandibular, four parapharyngeal) were analyzed with this assay. Eleven of 14 malignant tumors were DNA aneuploid by LSC analysis. All benign tumors showed diploid DNA content. The positive predictive value for malignancy was 1.0, the negative predictive value was 0.93, the correlation with routine histopathology was highly significant (p = 7.6 x 10(-9), Fisher's exact test). The calculated specificity of LSC analysis was 1.0 and the sensitivity was 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates the validity of slide-based cytometry for the preoperative prediction of malignancy in solid tumors being inaccessible for incision biopsy but suitable for FNABs such as those of the parotid gland.",M2
12641953,"[Quantitative study of the cellular nuclear DNA contents in odontogenic cysts and ameloblastoma]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proliferative potential of the epithelial cells in odontogenic keratocyst, radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst and ameloblastoma. METHODS: DNA contents and ploidy of basal and spinous cells in keratocyst, radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst, and the peripheral column cells and central reticular cells in ameloblastoma were analysis respectively. RESULTS: The more and higher DNA contents and the proliferating ploidy of keratocyst and ameloblastoma than those of radicular cyst and dentigerous cyst indicate the active proliferating potential. The spinous cells showed more active proliferating growth than the basal cells of keratocyst. The higher DNA contents of radicular cyst are related to the stimulus of the inflammation. The dentigerous cysts have more <e>di</e>-ploidy cells without active growth potential. CONCLUSIONS: The active cell proliferating growth in keratocyst and ameloblastoma is probably the pathological basis of their local aggressive biological behavior.",M2

METHOD: This study analyzed 50 oral and maxillofacial NHL cases and 10 reactive lymph nodes (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) by flowcytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Reactive lymph nodes were all diploid. The diploid rate of NHL was 54%, and aneuploidy rate was 46%. There was statistically significant difference between reactive lymph nodes and NHL in the DNA ploidy status and cell cycle data (SPF, CV, S + G2/M, <e>DI</e>). The S phase fraction (SPF) and S + G2/M had close relationship with the grade of NHL. SPF value and DNA ploidy status had no obvious relationship with the prognosis. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the FCM had diagnostic value in NHL, especially when the morphological diagnosis was difficult. Although the cell cycle data had no prognostic value, SPF and SPF + G2/M can show the proliferative status of NHL, which can help clinical doctor select therapeutic method.",M2
12590151,"Evaluation of prognostic factors following flow-cytometric DNA analysis after cytokeratin labelling: II. Cervical and endometrial cancer.In gynecologic oncology valid prognostic factors are necessary to define biologically similar subgroups for analysis of therapeutic efficacy. This study is the first published prospective study concerning prognostic significance of DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction in cervical and endometrial cancer following enrichment of tumor cells by cytokeratin labelling. Epithelial cells were labeled by FITC-conjugated cytokeratin antibody (CK 5, 6, 8, and CK 17) prior to flow cytometric cell cycle analysis in 91 specimens of cervical cancer and 73 samples of endometrial cancer. In cervical cancer neither DNA-ploidy nor S-phase fraction were relevant prognostic parameters. But CV of the G(0)G(1)-peak showed prognostic relevance in cervical cancer cells, even in multivariate analysis. This interesting observation, however, seems to have no therapeutic consequence due to the small discrimination capacity of CV. In endometrial carcinoma, gross DNA-aneuploidy (DNA-index &gt; 1.3) and a high percentage of proliferating cells (&gt;75th percentile) were univariate and multivariate highly significant prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. Especially DNA-aneuploidy (<e>DI</e>&gt;1.3) is one of the most important independent molecular biological prognostic factors. While diagnostic curettage we could identify risk patients even preoperatively by determination of the prognostic factors like histologic tumor type, grading, cervical involvement and DNA-ploidy. Thereby these patients could be treated primarily in an oncologic center. In conclusion, our investigations showed that the determination of DNA-ploidy should be done in endometrial carcinoma. In cervical cancer no clinical significance for determination of DNA-parameters was found.",M2
12187044,"Chromosomal aberrations in transitional cell carcinoma: its correlation with tumor behavior.OBJECTIVE: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to study numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, X and Y in interphase nuclei of 16 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cell lines of the urinary tract. The number of chromosomal signal copies was compared with the DNA ploidy and correlated with the cellular grading and original tumor staging. METHODS: The single-target FISH with the repetitive DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, X and Y were performed in 16 human TCC cell lines. For each test specimen, a minimum of 200 nuclei were analyzed. The number of fluorescent signals per nucleus was recorded. Tumor ploidy was analyzed using the DNA propidium iodide flow cytometric method. These results were correlated with tumor grade and stage. RESULTS: In two diploid TCC cell lines, on average 67% of detected chromosomes were <e>di</e>-(i)somic. In 14 aneuploid TCC cell lines, on average only 10% (0-44%) of detected chromosomes were di-(i)somic. Chromosome X was completely changed into polysomism in 16 TCC cell lines (native male:female ratio = 12:4) but was unrelated to tumor grade or stage. Chromosome Y was lost in 10 out of 12 (83%) TCC cell lines which originated from male patients but was unrelated to tumor grade or stage too. 31% of chromosomes 11 and 15 were disomic in 16 TCC cell lines, 38% of chromosome 3 was monosomic, and 81-88% (83 in average) of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 were polysomic. Disomic chromosome 11 associated with lower grade TCC and disomic chromosome 15 associated with higher grade TCC were noted (p &lt; 0.01). Higher incidence of low stage tumors was observed in TCC cell lines with disomic chromosome 11 or chromosome 15 (p &lt; 0.01). There was no correlation in somatic status of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 with tumor grade and stage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate that polysomism of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 and X occurs in most of the TCC cells with aneuploidy. The stability of chromosomes 11 and 15 is closely related to tumor grade and stage. The role of chromosome Y loss and monosomism of chromosome 3 in oncogenic relevant of bladder cancer is still unclear.",M2
12098058,"DNA index and S-phase fraction in curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma: analysis of prognosis and current trends.The DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and S-phase fraction (SPF) have been said to be independent factors in colorectal adenocarcinoma and have a different distribution from the clinicohistologic parameters. This study assesses the real efficacy of DI and SPF for curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinomas with respect to the prognosis and the clinicohistologic parameters. From July 1991 to October 1994 a total of 666 patients underwent curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma and DNA flow cytometry in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Medical Center Hospital, Taiwan. We defined diploid tumors as having a DI of ? 0.9 but &lt;1.1 and a nondiploid tumor as having a DI of &lt;0.9 OR &gt; 1.1. A high SPF was defined as being more than the median value for the total SPF. Altogether, 495 cases (74.32%) had a 5-year cancer-free survival. Tumor stage, DI, tumor location, and tumor morphology were associated with significant cancer-free survival in the univariate analysis (p = 0.0295, &lt;0.001, 0.0357, and &lt;0.001, respectively). After all factors were entered into the multivariate analysis, the independent factors for cancer-free survival were found to be stage, tumor location, and morphology (p &lt; 0.001, 0.012, and 0.044, respectively). In cases distinguished by the DI, diploid tumors had significantly more frequent right colon locations (p &lt;0.001). After cases were separated by the SPF (median value 18.4%), better histology (well differentiated adenocarcinoma) was noted with a low SPF (p = 0.017). No other clinicohistologic parameters had significant differences shown by the DI or SPF. Thus DI and SPF failed to appear as independent factors for 5-year cancer-free survival. The independent factors for curative colorectal adenocarcinoma were tumor stage, location, and morphology. Diploid tumors were located at the right colon more often, and low SPF indicated better histology in the univariate analysis.",M2
11865946,"DNA cytometric analysis of surgically treated squamous cell cancer of the uterine cervix, stage pT1b1-pT2b.OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of DNA content and DNA-related variables of proliferative activity regarding prognosis in cervical cancer. STUDY DESIGN: DNA image (ICM) andflow cytometry (FCM) were performed to determine the DNA index (<e>DI</e>), 5c-exceeding rate (5c-ER), S-phase fraction (SPF) and proliferation index (PI) in 163 patients with surgically staged pT1b1-pT2b squamous cell cancer of the uterine cervix and treated with primary radical hysterectomy. ICM was performed on imprint cytology, obtained from fresh tumor tissue, which was also used for FCM. Results were analyzed using the chi2 test and Cox regression analysis for risk of pelvic lymph node involvement, tumor recurrence and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: ICM was performed on all 163 and FCM on 133 samples. One-third of the tumors showed DNA aneuploidy. Analysis demonstrated prognostic significance of a DI &gt; or = 1.70, with a (70:30) 2.3-fold risk of recurrence (P=.024) and reduced RFS of 10 months (P=.003) in cases of DI &gt; or = 1.70. A high 5c-ER &gt; 11% was associated with pelvic lymph node involvement and decreased RFS (P &lt; or = .04). Significantly more relapses were found in tumors with SPF &gt; 12% (70.8% vs. 29.2%, P=.007). RFS was markedly reduced in tumors with high SPF (52.3 vs. 61.1 months, P=.011). Low proliferative tumors (PI&lt;25%) were associated with lower stage (P=.036) and increased RFS (61.2 vs. 47.1 months, P=.028). In multivariate analysis of clinicopathologic variables (pT category, nodal status, lymphovascular space involvement) and DNA related variables, pelvic lymph node involvement was the only significant predictor of RFS. In patients with nodal involvement, tumors with DI &gt;1.70 were associated with lessfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: DNA-related variables of cell cycle analysis were valuablefor predicting prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Tumors with DI&gt;1.70, 5c-ER &gt;11% and high proliferative activity (SPF&gt;12%, PI&gt;25%) represent a subgroup with a poor prognosis.",M2
11830540,"Interglandular cytogenetic heterogeneity detected by comparative genomic hybridization in pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study is to explore the mechanisms of intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity (ICH) in pancreatic cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, we investigated interglandular variation in 20 primary invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Three or four adjacent neoplastic glands were individually microdissected from a tumor specimen. Extracted DNA from each gland was amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide primed-PCR, followed by CGH. In addition, DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was measured by laser scanning cytometry in each case. CGH profiles displayed a wide variety of differences between glands within the same tumor in all cases, i.e., interglandular cytogenetic heterogeneity was distinct in pancreatic cancers. In this study, genetic changes detected in all regions of a tumor were classified as  region-independent  alterations, whereas changes seen in at least one, but not all regions were designated as  region-dependent  alterations, which resulted in ICH. The degree of ICH, which was manifested as the ratio of these two types of alterations, correlated closely with DI (Spearman rho = 0.842; P = 0.0002). Therefore, DI might be a surrogate marker for ICH. These results suggest that with tumor progression, ICH and DNA aneuploidy result from the successive appearance of region-dependent alterations attributable to chromosomal instability in tumor cells. Our data support a concept of individual cell heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer.",M2
11505676,"Comparative analysis of DNA content estimated by flow and image cytometry in breast tumor samples.The DNA ploidy status of 186 fresh primary breast tumors was analyzed in a comparative study of flow cytometric (FCM) and image (IA) analyses. Tumor size, histology and nodal status were also taken into account. The same piece of fresh tissue was used for touch imprints (IA) and for DNA analysis by FCM. Both methods provided concordant <e>DI</e> values in 158 (85%) tumors (r = 0.7490). The tumor grade and lymph node status significantly correlate with ploidy estimated by FCM and IA. We conclude that FCM and IA provide comparable results of DNA content although occasional discrepancies occur. IA seems to be a more sensitive method especially for diploid cases detected by FCM.",M2
11455977,"The association of the TEL-AML1 chromosomal translocation with the accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates in lymphoblasts and with ploidy in childhood B-progenitor cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.Lymphoblasts from children with B-progenitor cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BpALL) with chromosomal hyperdiploidy and with translocations affecting chromosome 12p11-13, accumulate high and low levels of methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs), respectively. Recently a cryptic translocation, t(12;21) (p13;q22), has been demonstrated by molecular and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques in this disease. The chimeric TEL-AML1 transcript, which has been associated with this translocation, can be detected in up to 25% of children with BpALL. We detected the TEL-AML1 and/or the AML1-TEL transcript in 30 (33%) of 91 patients studied. Levels of lymphoblast MTXPGs were lower in those with than in those without the TEL-AML1 translocation (P = 0.004). Hyperdiploidy was rare in lymphoblasts with the TEL-AML1 translocation (P = 0.047). Both ploidy (P= 0.0015) and TEL-AML1 status (P= 0.0043) were independently and significantly correlated with the log of the lymphoblast MTXPG level. However, the presence of TEL-AML1 or of hyperdiploidy accounted for only 22% of the variation of this value. Our results imply that each of 1.16 &gt; or = <e>DI</e> and the presence of the TEL-AML1 translocation confers a 50% decrease in lymphoblast MTXPG level. When planning reduction of therapy for either of the two excellent outcome categories of hyperdiploid or TEL-AML1 BpALL, one should consider the difference between these two subgroups in the ability of lymphoblasts to accumulate MTXPGs.",M2
11343383,"DNA content of granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes in the bone marrow smears of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.Recently, we have reported a high incidence of DNA hypodiploidy defined as DNA index (<e>DI</e>) in blasts/promyelocytes from 39 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) found to be without a relationship to cytogenetics. In the present study the DNA content (DI) in granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes measured in the same bone marrow smears from the above patients are reported. DNA hypodiploidy was found in mature cells, not only in myeloid cells (granulocytes and monocytes) but also in lymphocytes. A lower mean DI in each cell type of patients compared to controls was found. Pairwise comparison of the mean DI (+/-SE) in 32 patients with normal (n = 22) and abnormal (n = 10) cytogenetics and controls (n = 8) showed a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower value for each group of patients, respectively, in all cell types. No difference was found between the two groups of patients. Presence of weak-Feulgen stained nuclei (DI &lt; 0.40) in granulocytes and monocytes was more pronounced in patients expressing DNA hypodiploid immature cell populations, but only occasionally in lymphocytes, suggesting a link to an apoptotic event and intramedullary cell death. DNA hypodiploidy is shown to be a common feature even in mature cell populations in MDS bone marrows. Clonality, by means of DNA content, appears reasonable as regards the granulocytes and monocytes. DNA hypodiploid lymphocytes, on the other hand, might be small blasts (stem cells) or dying cell populations of unknown origin.",M2
11329938,"Analysis of DNA-ploidy using laser scanning cytometer in brain tumors and its clinical application.There have been few reports on investigation of the cell kinetics of brain tumors using a laser scanning cytometer (LSC).

The DNA-index (<e>DI</e>) and proliferating index (PI) of various brain tumors were determined, and the results showed that these indices reflected the malignancy of the tumors. The DI values were higher for astrocytoma grade IV than for astrocytoma grade II, frequently showing an aneuploid pattern. The determination of DNA-ploidy using LSC, together with cryopathological diagnosis, was considered to be useful for deciding the area to be resected for glioma perioperatively and to be worth applying clinically.",M2
10753530,"Thymoma--the usefulness of some prognostic factors for diagnosis and surgical treatment.AIMS: The aim of the study was to identify prognostic factors which could help evaluate both the treatment offered to patients with thymoma and late results. METHODS: Forty patients were treated for mediastinal thymoma. The patients were staged clinico-pathologically (according to Masaoka) on the basis of the retrospective analysis of their operation protocols as follows: seven (17.5%)-stage I, 19 (22. 5%)-stage II, 17 (42.5%)-stage III, seven (17.5%)-stage IV. Analysis of DNA contents in cell nuclei of 23 thymomas was performed by the flow cytofluorometric method. RESULTS: From the whole group of patients, 65% survived for 5 years, 55% survived for 10 years and 43% survived for 15 years. We noted significant differences in survival time between stage I and stage IV (P&lt;0.0012); stage II and stage IV (P&lt;0.0006), as well as between stage III and stage IV (P&lt;0. 005). Significantly worse prognosis was observed in the case of cortical thymomas as compared with medullary or mixed types (P&lt;0. 0001 P&lt;0.002). Analysis of DNA content showed signficantly higher probability of survival for the patients who had <e>DI</e>=1.0 (diploid), as compared with DNA &gt;1.0 (aneuploid) (P&lt;0.006). Of the 11 patients with diploid tumours, 91% survived for 5 years, but of the 12 aneuploid, only 23% survived. CONCLUSION: The most important positive prognostic factors influencing survival rate in patients with thymoma are: lower stage, medullary type (according to Muller-Hermelink classification), possibility of performing complete resection, diploidal nature of the tumour. Multivariate analysis of survival revealed clinico-pathological stage (according to Masaoka) and histological type (according to Salyer) as significantly independent prognostic factors.",M2
11064818,"Superficial urothelial (umbrella) cells. A potential cause of abnormal DNA ploidy results in urine specimens.OBJECTIVE: To determine the DNA ploidy distribution in urothelial superficial (umbrella) cells and to assess the value of the image analysis operator's experience. STUDY DESIGN: DNA ploidy was assessed in 12 cytologically negative bladder washes stained with Feulgen stain. All 12 cases were evaluated independently by three operators with different levels of cytopathology experience and different goals. Operator 1 (experienced) selected only nuclei of urothelial cells, avoiding nuclei of superficial cells; operator 2 (experienced) selected only nuclei of superficial cells; operator 3 (inexperienced) selected the largest and most-atypical-looking nuclei. Each operator measured a total of 100 nuclei per case. RESULTS: Operator 1 found all cases to be diploid (97% of nuclei on average). Operators 2 and 3 showed a wide range of results. Almost half the nuclei (47%) analyzed by operator 2 were in the diploid region, a third (35%) were in the tetraploid region, and the remaining (18%) ones had a DNA index (<e>DI</e>) in the range of 1.2-1.8 or &gt; 2.5. Operator 3 obtained the most abnormal results. Only 9% of the nuclei were diploid, while 37% were in the tetraploid region, 18% were in the hyperploid region, and 35% had a DI in the range of 1.2-1.8. Differences among results obtained by each operator were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The nuclei of superficial (umbrella) cells often have abnormal DNA content, which may cause abnormal DNA ploidy results in cytomorphologically normal bladder washes. Consequently, the nuclei of superficial cells should be avoided in the evaluation of urine samples. DNA analysis of urine specimens requires selection of nuclei only of deep urothelial cells by an experienced operator.",M2

A newly developed DNA image analyses (DNACE) was used in paraffin embedded tissues after enzymatic hydrolyses for evaluation of the DNA content in cervical cancer. In 30.3% of examined tissues (20/66) two subgroups was found. There was significant differences in the DNA indexes (<e>DI</e>) between the subgroups (p = 0.0001). In the remaining 69.7% of the cases only one subgroup was present. The frequency of two subgroups was higher between aneuploid (78.4%), or hyperploid (81.5%) type cervical cancer, however there was no significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand there was significant difference in the presence of two subgroups between the well and less differentiated cervical cancer. The frequency was higher between the less differentiated groups (p = 0.02). Looking at the prognostic value of subgroups, there was no significant correlation between the heterogeneity of cervical cancer and FIGO stage, or lymph node metastasis (p = 0.6855), or vascular/lymphatic space infiltration (p = 0.2558), or invasiveness of cancer (0.0823). There was neither significant value found between the outcome of disease and the number of subgroups present (p = 0.8738). It is though that the present of cellular heterogeneity in cervical cancer is connected with the differentiation of the cancer cells, and can be a good prognostic value in the anticipation of the aggressiveness of cervical cancer. Looking at the present result, there was no significant connection between the heterogeneity of cervical cancer and the outcome of the disease, so further examination should be done.",M2
10717619,"Evaluation of DNA ploidy and degree of DNA abnormality in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin using video imaging.BACKGROUND: Making a morphologic distinction between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors of the skin is frequently difficult, especially because  gray zones  between these lesions often exist. DNA image cytometry as an adjuvant method for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of premalignant lesions and malignant tumors of many other organs is already well established. The aim of this study was to determine whether DNA image cytometry is helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant melanocytic lesions and whether cytometry would give valid information with which to predict the prognoses associated with malignant melanomas. METHODS: DNA image cytometry was performed on 127 benign and 58 primary maligant melanomas of the skin as well as 11 metastatic melanomas, using an enzymatic single cell solution according to a method described by Heiden et al. in Cytometry (1991;12:614-21). RESULTS: DNA aneuploidy was graded by DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and a 2c deviation index (2cDI). In contrast to benign melanocytic lesions (with 16% DNA aneuploidy), primary and metastatic malignant melanomas had significantly higher frequencies of DNA aneuploidy (86% and 73%, respectively). In the degree of DNA aneuploidy, significant differences between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors could be observed. The mean 2cDI of aneuploid benign lesions was 1.0, whereas the primary malignant melanomas had a mean 2cDI of 2.92 and the metastatic melanomas a mean of 6.9. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy increased with Breslow thickness. Twenty-one patients with primary malignant melanoma developed metastases. All metastasizing primary tumors were aneuploid and showed a significantly higher grade of DNA aneuploidy than nonmetastasizing malignant melanomas. Moreover, none of the diploid malignant melanomas developed metastases. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that DNA image cytometry is prognostically and diagnostically relevant to the evaluation of melanocytic lesions of the skin. Nevertheless, it cannot be relied on alone to provide enough information for a diagnosis.",M2

METHODS: Clinical course, histopathology of the original tumor, and autopsy record were rewieved. The original tumor was analyzed for expression of CD44 variant 6, p16, p21, p53, retinoblastoma (Rb), and c-erb-2. DNA flow cytometry was performed on tissue samples from the original tumor and from the heart. Sequences of the HPV genome on cervical and cardiac tissue samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of CD44v6 and p16. No expression of p21, Rb, c-erb-B2, and p53 was seen. DNA flow cytometry of the original cervical tumor showed a DNA index (<e>DI</e>) of 1.0. DNA flow cytometry of tissue samples from the posterior wall and from the right ventricle of the heart showed two different aneuploid cell populations with DI of 1.6 and 2.2, respectively.

10589045,"DNA ploidy in colorectal cancer, heterogeneity within and between tumors and relation to survival.Flow cytometry was used to study the incidence of aneuploidy and to determine the significance of multiple sampling from colorectal tumors. DNA ploidy pattern has been proposed as a supplementary prognostic marker, but discrepancies in findings are major. DNA clonal heterogeneity, defined as two or more DNA aneuploid stemlines in the same tumor, is well established. However, most studies have been based on only one biopsy from each tumor. In our study multiple biopsies were taken from 163 patients (88 males and 75 females) electively operated for colorectal cancer. Tumor cells were harvested by fine needle aspiration from fresh frozen biopsies sampled at different sites of each tumor. DNA aneuploidy was detected in tumors from 145 patients (89%), and 18 patients (11%) had a solitary DNA diploid cell population. In a 79 month follow-up period 105 patients had died. Statistical analysis showed that distinction between diploidy and aneuploidy did not predict survival. However, grouping subpopulations into DNA diploid plus near diploid (DNA index (<e>DI</e>) 0. 97-1.15), DNA aneuploid with all aneuploid subpopulations in the interval 1.15-2.06, and DNA aneuploid with subpopulations with DI &lt; 0.97 and/or DI &gt; 2.06, showed a significant difference in survival in a Cox multivariate analysis including Dukes' stage P = 0.049 comparing the second group to the first and P = 0.01 comparing the third group to the first. In 21 (13%) patients only one subpopulation was found, 57 (35%) had two, 44 (27%) had three, and 41 (25%) had four or more different subpopulations. The association of DNA ploidy to survival is shown to be dependent on the number of biopsies analysed.",M2
10571521,"Molecular cytogenetics of chromosome 11 in pituitary adenomas: a comparison of fluorescence in situ hybridization and DNA ploidy study.Chromosome 11 abnormalities were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and compared with DNA ploidy in 24 surgically removed pituitary adenomas. The tumors were diagnosed and classified by histology, electron microscopy, and pituitary hormone immunocytochemistry. They included 2 densely granulated somatotroph (DG-SM) and 4 sparsely granulated somatotroph (SG-SM) adenomas, 3 SG lactotroph (LT), 2 mixed somatotroph-lactotroph (SM-LT), 4 functioning corticotroph (CRT), 1 silent CRT subtype 1, 1 thyrotroph, 1 mixed thyrotroph-somatotroph, 2 gonadotrophs, and 4 null cell adenomas. FISH analysis with an alpha-satellite DNA probe specific for chromosome 11 showed numerical abnormalities in 16 functioning (94%) and 5 nonfunctioning (71%) adenomas. Ten functioning tumors showed aneuploid histograms, whereas the remaining and all nonfunctioning adenomas were diploid. Aberrant chromosome 11 signals were noted mostly in aneuploid adenomas involving 17% to 100% of their cell population. The severity of chromosome 11 aberrations in adenomas containing extra copies often correlated with a higher DNA index (<e>DI</e>). Monosomy 11 as dominant aberration was noted in a mixed SM-LT and to a lesser degree in 3 CRT adenomas involving 21% to 97% of their cell population. Two of these CRT adenomas were associated with normal DI, whereas the remaining third showed a high DI, indicating increased copy number of chromosomes other than of chromosome 11. In conclusion, chromosome 11 abnormalities are common in all types of pituitary adenomas, occurring more frequently in functioning tumors. Specific numerical abnormalities, such as monosomy and trisomy, tend to be associated with certain adenoma types, whereas tumors with extra chromosome 11 copies often exhibit aneuploid histograms.",M2
10557042,"TEL-AML1 fusion identifies a subset of children with standard risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have an excellent prognosis when treated with therapy that includes a single delayed intensification.The Children's Cancer Group (CCG) found that children with moderate risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had an improved 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate when treated with therapy that included a doubled delayed intensification (DDI) vs a single <e>DI</e> (SDI) phase. Because of increased toxicity with DDI, it is important to determine whether subgroups of children with ALL can be identified who have excellent outcomes with SDI therapy. TEL-AML1 fusion and hyperdiploid DNA content are present in the leukemic blasts of significant proportions of children with ALL and have been associated with an excellent prognosis. In this study, we retrospectively examined the impact of TEL-AML1 status and ploidy on treatment outcome in a cohort of 75 children with standard risk ALL treated at our institution between 1983 and 1993 with SDI therapy. TEL-AML1 fusion was present in 19/43 (44%) evaluable cases. Fifteen of 56 (27%) evaluable cases were classified as hyperdiploid based on a modal chromosome number of &gt;/=51 and/or a DNA index of &gt;/=1.16. The 7-year EFS was 81% for the 19 TEL-AML1-positive patients vs 54% for the 24 TEL-AML1-negative patients (P = 0.0264). In multivariate analyses, TEL-AML1-positive status was associated with a superior EFS (P = 0.02) even when the intial white blood count was included in the model. Overall survival (OS) at 7 years for TEL-AML1-positive patients was 100% vs 83% for TEL-AML1-negative patients (P = 0.0677). There were no differences in 7-year EFS or OS based on ploidy comparisons. These results underscore the need to examine closely the effects of treatment intensification on specific biologically defined subgroups of children with ALL.",M2

10378652,"An automated image cytometry system for monitoring DNA ploidy and other cell features of radiotherapy and chemotherapy patients.DNA content and distribution in cell nuclei were studied in samples of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from 27 locally advanced breast and head and neck cancers in two going randomized trials that compared accelerated fractionation to standard fractionation radiation in locally advanced breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Two image cytometry methods were compared: a new, fully automated DNA image cytometry system (AIC) and a conventional image cytometry (CIC) system with manual selection, focusing, and segmentation of cells. The results of both techniques were compared on the basis of DNA histogram parameters including DNA index (<e>DI</e>), mean DNA values (MDV), and Auer's DNA histogram patterns. An excellent correlation was achieved between the two imaging techniques in terms of DI (r=0.985, p&lt;0.001) and MDV (r=0.951, p&lt;0.001) as well as between Auer's histogram patterns, where both methods agreed completely. It was concluded in these analyses that the two image cytometry methods were equivalent. However, the AIC offered an advantage by scanning samples in a fully automated way, which represented significant time saving for cytopathologists working with the system, as well as a larger number of cells used in the automated analysis. With the automated image cytometer, 500 relevant cells were collected and analyzed in about 10 minutes, where with the interactive (manual) method, it took typically an hour to collect and analyze only about 250 cells. Seventeen samples were sufficient for flow analysis. Image cytometry and flow cytometry showed good agreement in DI determination; however, three cases reported as diploid by flow cytometry were found to be aneuploid by image cytometry techniques.",M2

The CMM were classified as spindle A, spindle B, mixed spindle and epithelioid, epithelioid, and necrotic. RESULTS: The frequency of the aneuploid DNA pattern was 38%. Necrotic tumours showed a worse clinical outcome independent of the ploidy pattern. Spindle A tumours were found to be diploid. Spindle B and mixed tumours showed a prevalent diploid and near diploid aneuploid pattern (<e>DI</e> &lt; 1.3), yet aneuploidy was not correlated with a worse prognosis. The epithelioid tumours were prevalently diploid. However, 83% of the aneuploid tumours were hypodiploid (DI &lt; 0.95), and showed the worst prognosis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that increasing DNA abnormalities in CMM, especially in the epithelioid histotype, were associated with an increasing mortality.",M2
9917132,"Association of p53 accumulation with TP53 mutations, loss of heterozygosity at 17p13, and DNA ploidy status in 273 colorectal carcinomas.The aim of this study was to establish an experimentally based cutoff level for assessing p53 immunoreactivity in colorectal tumors. The accumulation of p53 protein in 273 colorectal tumors was correlated with previously obtained data on TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity at two 17p13 loci in the same tumors. The monoclonal antibody PAb 1801 was used for p53 staining, and the results obtained by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were similar. Mutation analyses of exons 5-8 were performed using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing. There were no statistically significant differences for any measured TP53 gene alteration between the group of tumors without p53-positive nuclei (n = 83) and the group with &lt;5% positive nuclei (n = 58). The majority of mutations within these groups were deletions/insertions and nonsense mutations without p53 accumulation. Therefore, we assume that 5% p53-positive nuclei is the relevant cutoff level to assess TP53 damage in colorectal tumors. A prerequisite for this recommendation is optimal conditions for p53 protein detection. The parameters for p53 dysfunction were correlated to DNA aneuploidy measured by flow cytometry. TP53 mutations were significantly associated with DNA aneuploidy (P &lt; 0.00001), and a nonrandom distribution of TP53 gene alterations among diploid (<e>DI</e> = 1), hyperdiploid (1.0 &lt; DI &lt; 1.3), and highly aneuploid (DI &gt; 1.3) tumors indicates that DNA hyperdiploid tumors constitute a separate developmental entity different from tumors with gross aneuploidy.",M2
9849422,"10 years' neuroblastoma screening in Europe: preliminary results of a clinical and biological review from the Study Group for Evaluation of Neuroblastoma Screening in Europe (SENSE).Between January 1986 and May 1996, 870,313 children were tested in European neuroblastoma (NB) screening programmes. Among these children, 82 cases of NB (age range 4-24 months, median 11 months) were detected by screening. 83% of the patients had localised NB and 17% were diagnosed with generalised NB (stage 4, 10%; stage 4s, 7%). Unfavourable biological markers (MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 1p36, DNA <e>di</e>/tetraploidy) were observed in 14% of 76 biologically examined cases. The median follow-up time of all the patients was 21.5 months (range 1-101 months). To date, 69 patients are in complete remission (CR) and 2 patients have died due to therapy (stage 4, 1 patient; stage 3, 1 patient with unfavourable markers). Apart from screened patients, 16 other patients with NB were found who had previously had a normal screening test, i.e. 'false negative' patients (age range 10-41 months, median 31.5 months). The median interval between screening and diagnosis was 24.5 months (range 6-35 months). 11 of the 'false negative' patients suffered from generalised NB (stage 4) and 5 had localised NB at diagnosis. Unfavourable biological markers were observed in 7/12 patients. 5 patients have died, 2 achieved partial remission and 9 CR. 9 of the 11 patients with unfavourable biological markers diagnosed due to NB screening are currently in CR. It is very likely that, among the patients without unfavourable biological markers, we detected tumours which may have regressed spontaneously. These children may have undergone 'unnecessary,' but unavoidable, diagnostic procedures and therapy. To reduce the number of 'false negative' patients, a later screening could be helpful and should be evaluated.",M2
9842638,"Benign and malignant cells in effusions: diagnostic value of image DNA cytometry in comparison to cytological analysis.Identifying tumor cells in body cavity fluids reliably is a well-known diagnostic problem. Since cytometric quantitation of nuclear DNA content appears to be a promising new tool in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of many solid human tumors, we examined its validity in detecting malignant cells in cytologically positive effusions. For this purpose, image DNA cytometric measurements, including the evaluation of DNA-ploidy and the calculation of the DNA index (<e>DI</e>), were performed in 80 body cavity fluids. The results were correlated with cytology, clinical course and final histological diagnoses. We used aneuploidy, as shown by interactive image DNA cytometry, as a marker for the malignancy of cells that occur in body cavity fluids with a 100% specificity and 94.8% sensitivity. Cytological investigation showed a 92.3% specificity and 95.4% sensitivity. Combining both methods raised the specificity to 100% and the sensitivity to 98.5% and had a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 93.8%. The DNA-index (DI) was significantly higher in malignant effusions than in benign effusions: 1.5 +/- 0.74 (mean +/- SD) versus 1.11 +/- 0.26 (p &lt; 0.05). Along with the difficult cytological evaluation of malignant cells in body cavity fluids, image DNA cytometry can be a helpful additional method for evaluating these cells. Combining the two techniques results in a highly specific and sensitive prediction of malignant cells. We, therefore, suggest using these methods for the reliable identification of tumor cells in effusions.",M2
9784313,"DNA content of ovarian immature teratomas and malignant germ cell tumors.OBJECTIVE: Ovarian germ cell tumors (GCT) show greater histologic and biologic heterogeneity than their testicular counterparts and remain poorly understood. Ploidy analysis was performed on ovarian GCT registered on Pediatric Oncology Group germ cell tumor protocols 9048 and 9049 to distinguish biologically distinct subsets of immature teratomas and malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. METHODS: Tumors from 22 patients (mean age 12 years) were analyzed and classified according to the submitting diagnosis; when pure samples of different histologic subtypes within a single tumor were possible, these were analyzed separately. Archival tissue was disaggregated and Feulgen stained; DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was determined by static image analysis utilizing internal normal cells as diploid controls. RESULTS: 26 histologic subtypes from 22 patients were analyzed. The tumors of 18 patients were composed of a single histologic subtype according to the submitting institution, including 6 dysgerminomas, 8 immature teratomas (IT), and 4 endodermal sinus tumors (EST). Two tumors contained both IT and EST components that were separately analyzed. Two tumors were classified as mixed germ cell tumors; 1 showed multiple intermingling subtypes unable to be separately analyzed and the second showed three histologic subtypes separately analyzed (IT, EST, embryonal carcinoma). From a total of 15 malignant histologic GCT subtypes in 14 patients, all but 2 demonstrated a DI of 1.4-2.4 (mean 1.85). Two diploid malignant GCT (1 EST, 1 dysgerminoma) were both associated with gonadoblastoma. Overall, 11 IT subtypes were analyzed and 9 were diploid (2 grade 1, 5 grade 2, and 2 grade 3). Two tumors originally submitted and classified as pure IT (grades 2 and 3) were aneuploid with a dominant diploid and a secondary aneuploid peak (both DI 1.7). On central review, both of these tumors demonstrated the presence of subtle patterns of EST that were unrecognized by the submitting institution and were much too small for separate analysis. Analysis of the 3 patients containing sufficient IT and EST to be separately analyzed all showed a diploid IT component and an aneuploid EST component. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of ploidy data suggests that polyploidization is a consistent finding in malignant ovarian GCT arising in normal patients, similar to the data for adult testicular GCT. Immature teratomas in this pediatric population, however, are most commonly diploid, regardless of grade. The development of EST within an IT is associated with the development of an aneuploid clone. Therefore, the finding of such a clone in an IT may be of diagnostic utility, as EST may be difficult to recognize. Last, the development of a malignant GCT in patients with gonadal dysgenesis may be pathogenetically different from those arising in normal patients, in that polyploidization is not required.",M2
9783366,"[The cytofluorimetric analysis of the nuclei in the regenerating rat liver in the late periods after x-ray irradiation]The flow cytofluorimetric method allowed to show that intact liver nucleus population of adult (6 months) rats consists of discrete ploidy classes (2c, 4c, 8c and 16c+), from which the diploid class was approximately a half of the total nuclei. Thirty days after the wholebody X-ray irradiation with a dose of 2 Gy, the percentage frequency of each nuclear class was statistically unchanged. However, the polyploidization level of the total nuclear population increased. Partial hepatectomy induces an entering into mitotic cycle (maximum S-phase; 22 h after operation) of the most of the hepatocyte nuclei in both irradiated and unirradiated animals. With that the relative number of nuclei in S-phase decreases in geometric progression according to increasing of ploidy class. In regenerating liver of irradiated rats in comparison with that of unirradiated ones, the greater part of nuclei enters into the mitotic cycle at the expense of <e>di</e>- and especially tetraploid nuclei.",M2
9744320,"DNA ploidy by image cytometry and karyotype in spontaneous abortion.We compared the DNA content (<e>DI</e>) by cell image analysis with the karyotype and morphological phenotype of paraffin-embedded tissues from 51 spontaneous abortions. The study included 21 cases with triploid, 19 cases with diploid, and 11 cases with aneuploid (monosomic, trisomic, or mosaic) karyotype. Measurements were performed by image analysis on the trophoblastic and stromal cells of chorionic villi using 5-microm-thick, Feulgen-stained sections. At least 200 cells were analyzed. Results were interpreted using DI ranges of 1.3 to 1.7 for triploid and 0.9 to 1.1 for a diploid profile. All 21 cases with a cytogenetically confirmed triploid karyotype had DI values within the triploid range, and all 19 cases with a diploid karyotype had DI values within the diploid range. All of the trisomies and monosomies also had a DNA mass within the diploid range. However, eight cases with a triploid karyotype also had a peak in the diploid range: one case with a diploid karyotype and one case with a trisomic karyotype each had an additional peak in the triploid range. We did not find a morphological correlation either with image analysis or with karyotype. We conclude that cell image analysis is a reliable method for detection of triploidy in spontaneous abortions. This relatively rapid method allows visual discrimination of the areas to be analyzed, avoids the problem of maternal cell contamination, and may unmask mosaic karyotypes that would go unrecognized by cytogenetic studies alone.",M2
9718998,"Prognostic significance of the DNA index in a colorectal cancer.DNA flow cytometry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks made from 230 surgically resected colorectal cancers, 109 (47.4%) of which were diploid tumors, and 121 (52.6%) aneuploid tumors. The DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was calculated as the ratio of the G0/G1 channel number of tumor cells to the G0/G1 channel number of stromal cells. There was no significant difference in survival between patients with diploid tumors and those with aneuploid tumors (P = 0.322), although the survival rate was significantly lower in patients with a high DI (&gt; or = 1.5) than in those with a low DI (&lt; 1.5) (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that Dukes' staging was the strongest predictor of survival, followed by the DI of tumor cells, then histological differentiation. In conclusion, it is suggested that the DI of tumor cells is instructive for predicting the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.",M2
9673413,"Flow cytometric studies on the relationship between DNA content and clinicopathologic features of pancreatic cancers.The purpose of this study was to determine DNA (<e>DI</e>) and proliferation indices (PI) in 26 pancreatic and 10 ampulla of Vater carcinomas by flow cytometry using paraffin embedded tissue samples. Furthermore, we analysed the relationship between these parameters and the traditionally used prognostic parameters (type, stage and grade) of the tumor. Out of the 26 pancreas carcinomas 15 proved to be DNA diploid and 11 DNA aneuploid, while among the 10 ampulla of Vater tumors 7 DNA diploids and 3 DNA aneuploids were found. The PI-ces in both type of carcinomas were significantly higher than PI-ces in the surrounding nontumorous pancreatic tissue. The average of PI in aneuploid carcinomas significantly exceeded the one of diploid carcinomas. In group of grade III-IV tumors the ratio of aneuploids (59%), and the average of PI (11.59% +/- 5.27%) proved to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05, both) than in grade I-II group (21%, PI = 8.16% +/- 4.03%). Among the tumors falling into the T1 class the ratio of aneuploids (29%) and of tumors (29%) characterized by a PI &gt; 8% proved to be lower than among the tumors of T2-T3 class (46%, 62%). The ratio of aneuploids among cases with lymphnode positivity was higher (3/4), than among those without (8/22), the single case with distant metastasis was also found to be aneuploid. The results indicate a close correlation between the DNA ploidy and PI and the stage and grade of pancreatic cancers.",M2
9651945,"DNA ploidy pattern in papillary renal cell carcinoma. Correlation with clinicopathological parameters and survival.Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a less frequent histomorphologic variant of renal cortical carcinoma (RCC). Morphologically, PRCC differs from other forms of RCC in that it is associated with frequent tumor infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes, and a tendency for central necrosis and cystic change. Follow-up data revealed that survival rates are higher among patients with PRCC than among patients with other forms of RCC. The authors explore the DNA content in a series of PRCC and correlate the findings with nuclear grade, pathological stage and survival. Using Flow Cytometry, we analysed the DNA ploidy pattern of 37 paraffin-embedded PRCC. At least 3 tumor fragments were analysed in each case. To obtain the reference diploid standard, the non-tumor renal tissue from the same case was added to the solution. Tumor ploidy was classified as diploid and aneuploid. The degree of DNA content abnormalities was given by the DNA Index (<e>DI</e>). An aneuploid DNA profile was found in 65% of the tumors. 25% of the aneuploid tumors presented near diploid peaks (1.10 &lt; DI &lt; 1.30; low degree aneuploidy), 25% were hyperdiploid, while 22% had a hypodiploid profile (DI &lt; 0.90). A homogeneous DNA ploidy pattern was observed in 25 tumors (68%), while there was intratumoral heterogeneity in 12 tumors (32%). Patients with aneuploid DNA patterns had high grade/stage tumors and died at the end of the follow-up period, while patients with diploid/near diploid profiles had low grade/stage tumors and survived. However, the multi-way analysis of variance performed in order to investigate the prognostic significance of ploidy pattern against tumor stage and grade showed a highly significant main effect of ploidy pattern. Moreover, the patients with hypodiploid DNA profile presented the worst prognosis. These results suggest that the DNA profile of PRCC is a highly significant prognostic index.",M2
9596272,"DNA index shift with disease progression in colorectal adenocarcinoma: a morphological and flow cytometric study.DNA index (<e>DI</e>) values seen in 86 sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas were related to clinical, morphological, and disease progression features. DI, whose overall distribution was bimodal with peaks in the diploid and from hypotriploid to tetraploid ranges, was related to pathological lymph node staging (pN), staging, lymphoid reaction, and tubular configuration. With increasing severity in pathological features, an irregular shift in DI class prevalence was seen, with no steady increase from diploidy to higher degrees of aneuploidy. All UICC stage I tumors (13% of total) were aneuploid, 50% being hypertriploid; diploidy (35%) and hypertriploidy (22%) prevailed in stage II carcinomas (41% of total), diploidy (35%) and hypotriploidy (30%) in stage III (30% of total), and triploidy (33%) in stage IV (15% of total). Amongst features related to stage (lymphoid reaction, depth of neoplastic embolization, grading, tubular configuration, and polymorphism), few were associated with DI, and none influenced DI shift and class prevalence through the stages. The biological capabilities of colorectal adenocarcinoma in relation to stage are expressed by certain aneuploid DI classes (hypertriploidy: absence of extracolonic spread; hypotriploidy: lymph node metastases; triploidy: distant metastases). Diploidy is unrelated to criteria defining stage above I and predicts 50% of cases with development of metachronous metastases. Irregular DI class shift through the stages may be attributable to different pathways of cancerogenesis and disease progression in diploid versus aneuploid carcinomas. Alternatively, assuming that the diploid fraction in aneuploid tumors contains neoplastic cells, pure diploid carcinomas represent the selection of a vital clone that may give rise to a further mixed population whose aneuploid DI is different and best fitted to express the biological capabilities of that given stage.",M2

There was a significant association between DNA aneuploidy and a high cellular proliferative activity, increased DI, poor differentiation of tumor, primary tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, and postmenopausal state. Increased proportion of cells in S-phase was associated with positive lymph node status and higher number of positive lymph nodes.

9569043,"Complex karyotypes in flow cytometrically DNA-diploid squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), DNA ploidy as determined by flow cytometry (FCM) has been found to yield prognostic information but only for tumours at oral sites. Cytogenetic findings have indicated complex karyotype to be a correlate of poor clinical outcome. In the present study, 73 SCCHN were investigated with the two techniques. Aneuploid cell populations were identified in 49 (67%) cases by FCM but in only 21 (29%) cases by cytogenetic analysis. The chromosome index (CI), calculated as the mean chromosome number divided by 46, was compared with the respective DNA index (<e>DI</e>) obtained by FCM in 15 tumours, non-diploid according to both techniques, DI being systematically 12% higher than CI in this subgroup. Eight (33%) of the 24 tumours diploid according to FCM had complex karyotypes, three of the tumours being cytogenetically hypodiploid, three diploid and two non-diploid. The findings in the present study may partly explain the low prognostic value of ploidy status as assessed by FCM that has been observed in SCCHN. In addition, we conclude that FCM yields information of the genetic changes that is too unspecific, and that cytogenetic analysis shows a high rate of unsuccessful investigations, thus diminishing the value of the two methods as prognostic factors in SCCHN.",M2
9568081,"Multiple synchronous colorectal carcinomas: a ploidy study by image analysis.Cytometry could represent an ancillary technique to morphology in order to understand whether multiple synchronous colorectal carcinomas arose independently. Twenty-eight multiple synchronous tumours, assessed by means of a computerized image analysis system for DNA ploidy, were categorized as diploid (4) or not diploid (24). The ploidy classes were: DNA-diploid, DNA-tetraploid, and DNA-aneuploid. The DNA Index (<e>DI</e>) ranged from 0,90 to 2,66. The overall concordance rate for ploidy and DI class with synchronous tumours was 69% and 31%, respectively. The high concordance rate in ploidic categories suggests the metastatic origin of our multiple synchronous tumours. Moreover, they showed site, Dukes' classification, degree of differentiation, percentage of ploidy class, and DI distribution comparable to the single colorectal carcinomas. In conclusion, image analysis is a reliable technique to determine the independent clonality or the common origin of multiple colorectal tumours when the evaluation based on the simple histopathological criteria is not satisfactory.",M2
9349901,"DNA ploidy analysis in breast carcinoma. Comparison of unfixed and fixed tissue analyzed by image and flow cytometry.OBJECTIVE: To form a methodologic basis for DNA analysis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma (IC) of the breast, including very small lesions, by comparison of flow cytometric (FCM) and image cytometric (ICM) methods for DNA quantitation. STUDY DESIGN: The material consisted of 41 DCIS lesions and 26 ICs. FCM DNA analysis of unfixed, frozen samples were compared to (1) FCM of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue; (2) ICM of imprints; and (3) ICM of paraffin-embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: FCM of unfixed tissue showed higher DNA measurement precision and a higher number of DNA nondiploid clones as compared to the other three methods. For the classification of DNA diploid/nondiploid cases, high concordance rates were found between the methods. Discordant cases were predominantly DNA neardiploid by FCM of unfixed tissue but DNA diploid by the other methods. The reproducibility of the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was best in the interval 1.2 &lt; DI &lt; or = 2.2; it was 74% for FCM of fixed tissue and 79% for ICM of imprints. Clones with DI &gt; 3 were found almost exclusively by ICM of imprints. For ICM of tissue sections, DI could not be reliably estimated. By ICM, contrary to FCM, a combined DNA diploid and nondiploid pattern was found frequently. CONCLUSION: Each of the methods has its own advantages and limitations. If possible, FCM should be combined with ICM. FCM of unfixed tissue is superior to the other methods with respect to precise DI estimation. Alternatively, FCM of fixed tissue and ICM of imprints may both give a reliable estimate of DI. ICM of tissue sections can discriminate DNA diploid from nondiploid clones, except for neardiploid subpopulations, and permits the analysis of very small lesions.",M2
9274787,"DNA flow cytometry in gastric carcinoma: implication in patients with potentially curative resection.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relevance of DNA ploidy as a prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer is controversial. The prognostic significance of DNA ploidy and its relationship to conventional histological grading and staging of the tumor (TNM stage, Lauren, Ming and WHO classification) were evaluated. METHODS: DNA ploidy of the tumor was determined by flow cytometry on archival material from 76 patients who underwent R0, D2 stomach resection. RESULTS: DNA aneuploidy was found in 39 cases (51%). No significant association between DNA aneuploidy and either patients' sex, pT, pN, type according to Ming or Borrmann and tumor localization was found. The incidence of DNA aneuploidy was significantly lower in tumors of diffuse type according to Lauren, in signet-ring cell or undifferentiated type (WHO), in grade 3/4 tumors, and in patients younger than 50 years. We found no significant difference in survival of patients with DNA aneuploid when compared to DNA diploid tumors, although the prognosis of the patients with lower DNA index (<e>DI</e> &lt; 1.2) tended to be better than that of higher DNA index (DI &gt; 1.2).

Factors affecting inter- and intralaboratory variability.A multicentric national quality control study has been organized under the auspices of the Italian Group of Cytometry to find a possible influence of some procedural steps in DNA flow cytometry measurements on DNA index (<e>DI</e>) values and to identify the main parameters affecting the interlaboratory variability. To 40 participating laboratories we provided suspensions containing unknown mixture of different cell types: an homogeneous thymocyte population used to check instrument linearity; one mixture composed of two cell types characterized by DI = 1.00 and 1.10; and another composed of three different cell types with relative DIs of 1.00, 1.26, and 1.62, respectively. Possible effects due to staining protocols were studied, allowing the participants to stain cellular DNA according to the procedure routinely adopted in each laboratory, in addition to a standardized procedure with a fixed PI solution. As far as the influence of instrument linearity on DI values is concerned, we did not find any correlation with the DI variability observed, even if the use of a standardized staining protocol could lead to a sensible gain in interlaboratory DI reproducibility. Twenty-five of 40 (65%) laboratories were able to discriminate the near-diploid subpopulation, and a coefficient of variation of less than 4% was the minimum condition necessary to recognize the DI = 1.1 population. In samples containing two aneuploid subpopulations, 25 of 35 (71.4%) laboratories showed a high reproducibility with the standard staining protocol and 22 of 38 (57.9%) with the free staining protocol.

9142183,"Intratumoral heterogeneity in primary breast carcinoma: study of concurrent parameters.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intratumoral heterogeneity for prognostic factors (ploidy, proliferation, hormone receptor positivity) has been demonstrated in primary breast carcinoma by both flow cytometric and image analysis methods. Previously, heterogeneity in tumors had been demonstrated for only singular parameters. Our objective, using maps of tumors in which discrete regions can be analyzed simultaneously for DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and proliferative activity, was to demonstrate heterogeneity with respect to two parameters and to determine whether any interparametric relationships existed. METHODS: We analyzed 25 cases of archived, paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma (ductal) for Feulgen stain DNA analysis and MIB-1 immunohistochemistry using the CAS 200 Image Cytometer. For each tumor, four discrete regions were analyzed including tumor-host tissue interface sectors. RESULTS: Of 25 cases, 19 (76%) were homogeneously diploid or near-diploid aneuploid, and 6 (24%) were heterogeneous. Within the heterogeneous group, all cases had at least one diploid and one or more aneuploid populations from separate discrete regions. Five of six DI heterogeneous tumors displayed diploid values for the overall measurements of the respective tumors, based on analysis of 200 or more nuclei. Eight of 25 cases (32%) showed significant measurable variation for MIB-1 proliferative activity in various sectors of tumor. All the MIB-1 heterogeneous tumors, with one exception, were homogeneously diploid. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that (1) heterogeneity is present with respect to DI and proliferative activity in breast carcinoma and is relatively common, (2) tumors homogeneous for one parameter may be heterogeneous for another, and (3) heterogeneity for proliferative activity is more common in homogeneously diploid tumors than in heterogeneous/aneuploid tumors.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on 59 RMS patients enrolled onto the ICS-RMS88 protocol (seven botryoid, 35 embryonal, and 17 alveolar RMS), for which formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was available. Nuclear suspensions for cytometric investigation were obtained using a mechanical disaggregation. Tumors were distinguished according to their DNA index (<e>DI</e>) value as follows: diploid (0.9 &lt; DI &lt; 1.1), hyperdiploid (1.1 &lt; or = DI &lt; 1.8 or DI &gt; or = 2.2), and tetraploid (1.8 &lt; or = DI &lt; 2.2); for analysis of SPF, a cutoff value of 14% was used. RESULTS: DNA histograms were diploid in 19 (33%) cases, hyperdiploid in 29 (49%), and tetraploid in 10 (32%). One patient showed both a hyperdiploid and a tetraploid peak. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate by ploidy status was 73% in hyperdiploid patients as compared with 33% and 25% in diploid and tetraploid patients, respectively (P = .0012). A striking difference emerged when the 5-year OS for the combined diploid and tetraploid RMS groups was compared with survival of the hyperdiploid RMS group: 30% versus 73%, respectively (P = .0006). In addition, the SPF was prognostically relevant: 5-year OS by SPF less than or greater than 14% was 70% and 36%, respectively (P = .009). Multivariate analysis confirmed the importance of DNA content (P = .0006) and SPF (P = .034) in predicting survival. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that ploidy and SPF are important new prognostic factors that are able to identify selected groups of patients at high risk of treatment failure, even if the tumor's presentation is favorable according to standard criteria.",M2
9474308,"DNA index and % S phase fraction in posterior uveal melanoma: a 5 year prospective study of fresh tissue using flow cytometry.In many different solid tumours the DNA content of cells has been reported to be associated with malignancy. With one exception, studies using flow cytometry to estimate cellular DNA in uveal melanoma have used archival material. We report the findings of a prospective study using fresh uveal melanoma where the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and percentage of cells in S phase (%SPF) have been determined by flow cytometry in 51 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-one (80%) of the tumours were large, 9 (18%) were medium and only 1 was small. Eight (16%) were epithelioid tumours, 41 (80%) were mixed cell and only 2 were spindle B cell tumours. Twenty-seven tumours were diploid, of which 10 (37%) developed metastases. Of the 24 aneuploid tumours, metastases developed in 6 (25%). The median %SPF was significantly reduced in patients with diploid tumours compared with aneuploid tumours (p &lt; 0.0001), but there were no significant differences in %SPF between tumours associated with or without metastatic disease. The DI and %SPF were not significantly associated with the operation performed, cell morphology, tumour size or location. Neither %SPF nor aneuploidy was associated with a poor prognosis. Our results suggest that the estimation of DI or %SPF by flow cytometry is of little value in predicting survival from uveal melanomas after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.",M2

Expression of P53 product in the different ploidy classes.The aim of the study was to correlate the DNA Index (<e>DI</e>) and S-phase fraction (SPF) values determined by multiparametric flow cytometry in breast cancer (mainly T1 and T2 stages) with several clinico-pathologic variables and other biological parameters. For this purpose, a total of 136 breast cancers were submitted to flow cytometry and to several types of immunohistochemical analyses. Among clinico-pathologic data we considered pT, pN and grade and among immunohistochemical markers, hormonal receptors, P53, c-erbB-2 and MIB-1. We found that DNA aneuploidy was strongly correlated with high tumoral grade, absence of hormonal receptors, high proliferation, as shown by high MIB-1 (&gt; or = 36%) and SPF values (&gt; or = 13.3%), and P53 positivity. Grouping the tumours according to their DI values, we observed a relative significantly higher correlation of the near-triploid range carcinomas (DI 1.40-1.60) with immunohistochemical expression of P53 (p = 0.0001). Near-triploid DI was also associated with a high proliferative activity, expressed both by SPF (p = 0.0001) and MIB-1 reactivity (p = 0.0001), high tumoral grade (p = 0.0001) and presence of axillary metastases (p = 0.03). These data suggest that DNA near-triploid tumours in breast cancer may have a more aggressive behaviour in comparison with other DI classes.",M2
9327496,"S-phase fraction, 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine labelling index, duration of S-phase, potential doubling time, and DNA index in benign and malignant brain tumors.Seventy-one histologically malignant brain tumors, 52 histologically benign brain tumors, and 14 cerebral metastases were characterized according to DNA content and proliferative capacity. DNA ploidy, DNA index (<e>DI</e>), S-phase fraction (SPF), 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) labelling index (LI), duration of S-phase (Ts), and potential doubling time (Tpot) were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). In histologically benign tumors, a high percentage of DNA diploid tumors and a low proliferative capacity in DNA diploid tumors were found. Histologically malignant tumors and cerebral metastases were both found to be characterized by a low percentage of DNA diploid tumors and a high proliferative capacity in DNA diploid tumors. The proliferative capacity of DNA aneuploid benign tumors and that of DNA aneuploid malignant tumors, however, appeared not to differ significantly. The number of DNA aneuploid tumors was small. Duration of S-phase was short (range 3.9-4.7 hr) and appeared not to differ between the three groups. From this, the observed differences in Tpot values should be accredited mainly to differences in LI. High-grade as well as low-grade gliomas both appeared to be characterized by malignant (FCM) features, i.e., 1) a high percentage DNA aneuploidy, 2) a high mean DI (for DI &gt; 1), and 3) a high proliferative capacity.",M2
8946143,"One-tube triple staining method for flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy and phenotypic heterogeneity of human solid tumors using single laser excitation.We have developed a  one-tube  triple staining procedure that allows the identification of intratumor phenotypic subpopulations by FCM. Solid tumors were dissociated by a combined mechanical/ enzymatic method. Ovarian ascites tumor cell aggregates were enzymatically dissociated using trypsin. An antikeratin 8/18 MAb was used to label the epithelial fraction of these tumor samples. A second MAb directed against the leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was applied to identify nonneoplastic DNA-diploid cells. Other MAbs used as a second marker were directed against a tumor-associate surface, a cytoplasmic, or a nuclear antigen. Cells were stained using subclass-specific fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) or R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies. DNA was stained with propidium iodide (PI). Triply stained samples were measured on a standard bench-top flow cytometer (FACScan). Keratin 8/18-positive cells, LCA-positive cells, and DNA could be simultaneously detected in dissociated breast carcinomas, mixed Müllerian tumors, and ovarian ascites specimen for refining DNA index (<e>DI</e>) calculations and S phase fraction (SPF) determination. Coefficients of variation (CV) of the G0G1 peak of the DNA histograms obtained ranged from 2.55% to 4.64% and from 2.71% to 4.71% for the DNA-diploid and -aneuploid fractions, respectively. In DNA-diploid tumors, antigen expression (HER-2/Neu, proliferating cell nuclear antigen) could be analyzed without interference of fluorescence signals from nonneoplastic cells. Neoplastic tumor subpopulations were clearly identified based on both DNA-ploidy status and heterogeneity of antigen expression. The present method offers new possibilities for multiparameter DNA FCM on clinical samples and enables the identification of intratumor neoplastic subpopulations based on antigen expression and DNA-ploidy status.",M2
8917354,"Flow-cytometric analysis of the DNA content in paraffin-embedded tissue and in fresh tumour samples obtained from renal cell carcinoma: comparison of DNA ploidy using ethidium bromide and mithramycin.With the help of the deparaffination technique described by Heldly, it has become possible to conduct large-scale flow-cytometric (FCM) studies, including retrospective DNA analysis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The quality of these histograms, however, has to be comparable to the quality of the analyses from fresh tumour tissue. The present study compares the application of FCM on fresh tumour tissue from RCC with paraffin-embedded archive material, thus for the first time, the same combination of stains (ethidium bromide/mithramycin) was used for both materials. From a total of 44 tumours, 125 histograms were obtained from fresh tumour tissue. Aneuploidy was found in 78 (62.4%) of the DNA analyses (coefficient of variation, CV = 5.5%). These 78 aneuploid histograms were compared with 228 sections from the archive material which had been deparaffined and stained. This involved, a deparaffinising period of twelve hours as well the application of pepsin and protease, which was necessary to obtain high-quality histograms (CV = 6.0%). Retrospectively, a total of 58 histograms from 36 cases were available for comparison. Of the archive material, 23/36 tumours were classified as aneuploid; thus new stem cell lines could be detected retrospectively in 63.8% of the cases. The comparison of DNA indices (<e>DI</e>) in the two series produced no significant differences, and the comparison of the mean values for the CV-5.5% for native material histograms and 6.0% for archive material histograms-was not statistically significant. The detritus part in the archive histograms revealed a mean value of 6.3% for native histograms the mean value was 13.4%. These differences were also not significant. These results show that, using the staining combination ethidium bromide/mithramycin, the quality of the histograms obtained with archive material is equal to the quality of the histograms obtained from fresh tumour material. Furthermore, when taking into consideration the clonal heterogeneity of RCC, it is possible to use retrospective analysis to detect aneuploidy with a high degree of certainty and accuracy.",M2
8826867,"Hypodiploidy, Ki-67 growth fraction and prognosis of surgically resected lung cancers.One hundred and thirty-seven lung cancer patients (123 non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 10 small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) and four carcinoid tumours) who underwent surgery in an attempt at complete resection were prospectively entered in a study whose aim was to determine the prognostic significance of a hypodiploidy or a multiploidy pattern of tumour cell DNA content and a high immunohistochemical reactivity of Ki-67, a nuclear antigen related to the cell cycle. Indirect immunoperoxidase reactivity of Ki-67 on frozen tumour tissue sections was evaluated both visually, using a classical semiquantitative scale, and by means of a computer-assisted image processor. Cell DNA content analysis was done using static computer-assisted cytometry on tumour cytological prints stained by the pararosaline Feulgen-Schiff technique. The ploidy was characterised for each tumour by DNA index (<e>DI</e>), percentage of hypodiploid cells and type of DNA content histogram (near diploid, hyperdiploid, hypodiploid and multiploid). Ki-67 immunostaining was negative in 64 tumours (48%) and positive in 69 (52%). DNA histogram classification disclosed 57 (42%) near diploid tumours. Among the 80 (58%) aneuploid tumours, 16 were hypodiploid, 44 hyperdiploid and 20 multiploid. The prevalence of both a positive Ki-67 immunostaining and an aneuploid DNA histogram differed according to histology as SCLC demonstrated a higher frequency of both features when compared with NSCLC and carcinoid tumours. On the other hand, Ki-67 immunostaining and ploidy did not significantly differ according to degree of differentiation, nodal status and Mountain's stage grouping. The percentage of cells in the hypodiploid modal DNA was significantly higher for tumours which demonstrated a high Ki-67 immunostaining, suggesting a link between growth fraction and DNA content abnormalities. In univariate analysis, survival did not differ significantly according to either the Ki-67 immunohistochemical reactivity or the DNA index. Patients with a hypodiploid tumour had a shorter survival than patients with other DNA histogram patterns but, owing to the low frequency of hypodiploidy, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In Cox's proportional hazard model, an SCLC histology, an advanced tumour status, a positive nodal status and a hypodiploid tumour (hazard ratio: 2.070; 95% confidence interval 1.041-4.116) were significant determinants of survival. We conclude that hypodiploidy in lung cancer is a distinct DNA content abnormality as it contributes significantly to prognosis. Neither visually assessed nor computer-generated Ki-67 immunostaining measurements significantly determine prognosis.",M2
8756385,"DNA index of glial tumors in children. Correlation with tumor grade and prognosis.BACKGROUND: Although DNA index (<e>DI</e>) has prognostic significance in a variety of pediatric malignancies, there are few data regarding its utility in central nervous system (CNS) tumors. We have previously shown that patients with hyperdiploid medulloblastoma have a significantly better survival than those whose tumors are diploid. Here, we examine the effect of DI and tumor grade on the progression free survival (PFS) of 57 patients with a variety of glial neoplasms. METHODS: DI was determined by flow cytometry on freshly obtained tumor tissue from the initial diagnostic specimens; a DI = 1.0 was defined as diploid (DIP), 1.0 &lt; DI &lt; 1.1 as near diploid (NDIP), and DI &gt; 1.1 as hyperdiploid (HYP). Tumors were histologically graded according to the World Health Organization classification. RESULTS: There were 21 Grade I tumors, 20 Grade II, 8 Grade III, and 8 Grade IV. Among the 41 low grade tumors (Grade I-II), 39 were DIP or NDIP, and 2 were HYP. Among the 16 high grade tumors (Grade III-IV), 9 were DIP, 2 NDIP, and 5 HYP. The 4-year PFS of low grade tumors was 70% (standard deviation [SD] 12%) versus 8% (SD 7%) for high grade tumors. There was a significant correlation between low grade tumor histology and a DIP/NDIP DI (P = 0.015), and univariate analysis suggested improved PFS was associated with DIP/NDIP tumors (P = 0.05). However, DI did not remain a significant prognostic factor after being stratified by tumor grade (P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike medulloblastoma, DI is not an independent prognostic factor in pediatric glial tumors.",M2
8678553,"[DNA index as a significant prognostic indicator of colorectal cancer]To investigate the prognostic significance of DNA ploidy pattern and DNA index (<e>DI</e>), DNA contents were measured by flow cytometer in 412 patients with colorectal cancer and correlation between their prognoses and DNA contents were analyzed on the same clinical stage. There were significant differences in the survival rate and the incidence of tumor recurrence between diploid and aneuploid tumors, especially the poor survival rate and frequent tumor recurrence in the aneuploid tumor with DI above 1.5. Cox's multiple regression proportional hazard model was used to investigate the prognostic value of DNA ploidy pattern, DI and clinicopathological findings. From these analyses, DI 1.5 was found to be the most significant prognostic factor. These results suggest that flow cytometrically evaluated DI values have a relevant independent power for predicting the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients.",M2
8645063,"Ploidy as a prognostic feature in colonic adenocarcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether DNA content and cell-cycle kinetic characteristics in Dukes stage B colonic adenocarcinomas provide additional prognostic information in the context of clinicopathologic variables of known significance. DESIGN: Archival, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 210 Dukes B colonic adenocarcinomas were retrieved. After confirming stage, tumor cell nuclei were extracted, suspended, and stained. Cell nuclei from adjacent normal colon mucosa were used as controls. SETTING: University-based, tertiary cancer referral center. INTERVENTIONS: Samples obtained from tumors resected at our institution between 1965 and 1984 were analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and percentages of cells in synthesis (S) phase (%S) and in G2 and mitosis (M) phases (%G2M). The data were correlated with 5-year survival. Follow-up was complete in all patients to at least 5 years. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the highest survival rates were associated with DI values near 1 and 2 (diploid and tetraploid tumors, P = .02) and the lowest %G2M values (tumors with fewer mitoses; P = .01). Five-year survival rates also differed significantly between patients with diploid (DI &lt; 1.1) and those with aneuploid (1.1 &lt; DI &lt; 2) tumors (80% vs 64%, respectively; P = .02). Multivariate analysis revealed that race (P &lt; .01), lymphatic or capillary microinvasion (P &lt; .03), and ploidy (P &lt; .05) were significantly associated with outcome. The influence of ploidy, race, and microinvasion on 5-year survival was estimated with logistic regression, and 8 subgroups of patients emerged with 5-year survival probabilities ranging from 39% for black patients with aneuploid tumors and microinvasion to 88% for white patients with diploid tumors and no microinvasion. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor DNA content provides additional independent information that allows further refinement of our prognostic ability in patients with Dukes B colonic adenocarcinoma. This may aid in the identification of a cohort of patients who may potentially benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy.",M2
8623770,"p53 expression in colorectal cancer: relation to tumor type, DNA ploidy pattern and short-term survival.p53 protein expression was evaluated in a series of 204 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry using frozen tissue sections and monoclonal antibody DO-7. Nuclear staining of more than 5% of neoplastic cells was observed in 124 (60.8%) adenocarcinomas, which were classified as p53 positive. p53 immunoreactivity was found to he unrelated to several clinical and pathologic variables, including age and sex of patient, tumor site, tumor stage, grade of differentiation, pattern of growth, degree of peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration, and venous invasion. A strong association was demonstrated between p53 immunostaining and tumor type. Only 4 of 21 mucinous carcinomas examined (19%) were p53 positive. Conversely, 120 of 183 (65.6%) nonmucinous adenocarcinomas showed positive p53 immunostaining (P &lt;.0001). p53 expression also was related to the flow cytometric DNA ploidy pattern, aneuploid carcinomas with <e>DI</e> &gt;1.20 showing higher frequency of p53 overexpression than DNA diploid, and aneuploid tumors with DI &lt; or = 1.20 (P = .0003). No relationship was found between p53 expression and the Ki-67 proliferation index. With respect to the total study population (mean follow-up 33.4 months; range 19-47 months) the duration of overall survival was independent of p53 expression. In the group of 141 patients with stage I, stage II, and stage III disease who had undergone curative resection, positive p53 immunostaining was associated with poorer overall survival (P = .029). Subgroup analysis showed that the reduced survival conferred by p53 overexpression was confined to patients with stage III tumors (P = .027). However, in multivariate analysis, p53 expression failed to demonstrate independent prognostic significance. Our results indicate that immunohistochemical analysis of p53 expression provides valuable information for the understanding of colorectal cancer biology and clinical behavior.",M2

We have measured and compared the DNA indices in 41 cases. There were 29 tongue SCCHN, 20/29 were primary and 9/29 were recurrent. Mean DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was 1.19 (range 0.70-1.81) and 1.28 (range 0.79-1.94) respectively. There were 12 tonsillar cases, 10/12 primary and two out of 12 recurrent. Mean DI was 0.84 (range 0.57-1.09) and 1.00 (range 0.98-1.02) respectively. Mean DNA indices of both primary carcinomas were lower than the mean DNA indices of the recurrent carcinomas. This difference between the two groups may be a reflection of their tumour biology. However, since our study is small no definite conclusions can be made at this stage. We aim in the future to evaluate the prognostic role of DNA indices of patients with paired primary and recurrent SCCHN. This may be of clinical value and improve the treatment modalities available to this group.",M2

METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates from 28 myeloid leukemic patients were fixed in 95% ethanol solution and stained using the Papanicolaou method. The nuclear area and DNA content were measured. An immunohistochemical study was performed using monoclonal antibody (JSB-1) directed against P-GP. RESULTS: Leukemic cell morphology changed once or twice after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blastic crisis (BC) of chronic myeloid leukemia, or chronic neutrophilic leukemia. DRMLC showed severe atypia and were morphologically distinguishable from normal myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and drug-sensitive leukemic cells at the diagnosis of AML or BC. The mean nuclear index (NI) and DNA index (<e>DI</e>) of DRMLC were significantly larger than those of drug-sensitive leukemic cells of AML or BC. The frequency of aneuploidy and P-GP expression was 9.1% and 4.5%, respectively, at the diagnosis of AML or BC, and 92.8% and 28.5%, respectively, for resistant disease. The incidence of heterogeneity in DNA ploidy was 86.3%. CONCLUSIONS: DI and NI values larger than 1.2 and the expression of P-GP are significant indications of DRMLC.",M2

The latter included the evaluation of DNA ploidy, the calculation of DNA index (<e>DI</e>), the determination of S phase fraction (SPF), and cell proliferation associated with Ki-67 antigen expression. Propidium iodide was used for the DNA staining, and fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal mouse antibodies were applied to the human Ki-67 antigen staining. The specimens were analyzed by the Becton Dickinson (BD) FACScan apparatus. 10(4) events were collected, and thereafter the obtained data were analyzed by the software Lysis II and CellFit (BD) for DNA and Ki-67 data analysis, respectively. Out of the 28 cases examined, 18 (64%) of the malignant effusions were aneuploid. All of the benign effusions were typically diploid. The average SPF of benign, malignant diploid, and malignant aneuploid cases was 6, 6, and 30 respectively. The comparison between SPF and DI in malignant cases showed a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001). The average of Ki-67-positive cells that were benign, malignant diploid, and malignant aneuploid were 11, 19, and 35, respectively. There was a significant correlation between Ki-67 expression, SPF (p &lt; 0.05), and the percent of the aneuploid cell population (p = 0.01). The sensitivity of conventional cytology, the determination of DNA ploidy and of Ki-67 expression, was 80, 64, and 92%, respectively; specificity was 100% for cytology and DNA ploidy and 46% for Ki-67 expression. These data show that Ki-67 antigen expression is a potentially useful adjunct to cytometric DNA content analysis, determination of SPF, and conventional cytology in the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions.",M2
7491521,"DNA index and ploidy distinguish normal human parathyroids from parathyroid adenomas and primary hyperplastic parathyroids.BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to identify factors that might aid in diagnosis and intraoperative management of hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: We analyzed biopsy specimens of 242 parathyroids from 159 patients by use of flow cytometry and image cytometry (ICM) for DNA index (<e>DI</e>), defined as the content of nuclear DNA compared with that expected for a DNA diploid standard, for proliferative index (PI), and for ploidy (diploid versus aneuploid or tetraploid). RESULTS: True normal and normal parathyroids from patients with solitary adenomas were uniformly diploid. Abnormal ploidy (aneuploidy or tetraploidy) was identified frequently in adenomas and occasionally in hyperplasias with the exception that multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) biopsy specimens were uniformly diploid. DI for adenomas was similar to that for hyperplasias, and DI of both was higher than for normal glands. ICM-DI correlated positively with flow cytometry-DI and patient age and inversely with serum parathyroid hormone. PI was relatively low in all groups but was higher for hyperplasias versus normal parathyroids from patients with solitary adenomas and MEN versus non-MEN. PI correlated inversely with patient age. CONCLUSIONS: DI by ICM differentiates normal from abnormal parathyroids. DI might influence extent of resection in two- and three-gland hyperplasia and selection of the most appropriate gland for autografting and cryopreservation in patients with four-gland hyperplasia.",M2

If five or more samples were analyzed, then heterogeneity was found in eight of ten cases. No conclusive correlation could be found between DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and histopathology. Our results on DCIS demonstrate a very high concordance with invasive breast cancer with respect to the frequency of DNA nondiploid cases, distribution of DI, occurrence of multiple clones, and S-phase fraction.

Thirty-one (20.4%) of the patients showed disease recurrence or persistence (R/P) after radiotherapy. Flow-cytometric DNA ploidy measurements were performed in 72 cases; 20 had tumor R/P and 52 did not. Tumor R/P occurred more frequently (in 17 [85%] of 20 cases) in patients with diploid tumors. The hazard ratio of recurrence in diploid tumors as compared with aneuploid tumors, after inclusion of all the other significant prognostic factors in a Cox proportional hazards model, was 8.9 (P &lt; .01).

7611787,"[Correlation of intratumor DNA ploidy distribution pattern and Ki-67 index in large bowel carcinomas]Seventy cases of surgically resected specimens of large-bowel carcinomas were used. DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry for step-wise sections in each carcinoma. Intratumor DNA ploidy distribution pattern was classified into 5 types: Type A showing diploidy in all sections; Type B showing aneuploidy in all sections with the same DNA index (<e>DI</e>); Type C showing diploidy in the majority of the sections and aneuploidy in a part; Type D showing aneuploidy in the majority of the sections and diploidy in a part; and Type E showing aneuploidy in all sections with different DI in some parts. Ki-67 in cell nuclei was stained immunohistochemically for the 4 microns-thick paraffin section using MIB1 monoclonal antibody, and the Ki-67 index expressing the growth fraction was calculated. Ki-67-index (Mean +/- SD) of 4 cases in Type A showed 20.6 +/- 4.88, that of 16 cases in Type B showed 37.5 +/- 9.62, that of 2 cases in Type C showed 42.4 +/- 0.21; that of 26 cases in Type D showed 41.8 +/- 10.6 and that of 22 cases in Type E showed 41.7 +/- 8.58.

The cellular DNA content and PCNA labeling index (LI) % were assayed with flow cytometry using simultaneous double staining technique. The cells of G0/G1 phase of cell cycle were classified into two categories by the DNA index (<e>DI</e>); diploid cells (DI = 1.0) and aneuploid cells (DI &gt; 1.0). PCNA LI % was measured at all phase and G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. PCNA LI % of diploid tumors was significantly higher than that of normal lung tissues (p &lt; 0.05), and PCNA LI % of aneuploid tumors was significantly higher than that of diploid tumors (p &lt; 0.05). PCNA LI % of diploid cells of tumors was significantly higher than that of diploid cells of normal lung tissues (p &lt; 0.05), and PCNA LI % of aneuploid cells of tumors was significantly higher than that of diploid cells of tumors (p &lt; 0.05).

7741101,"Relationship between DNA ploidy level, nuclear size, and survival in large cell lymphoma.Intermediate and high grade subtypes of non-Hodgkin's large cell (LCL) and immunoblastic lymphomas exhibit considerable variability, and histologic morphology alone may not adequately characterize those features important for prognosis. The relationship between nuclear morphology and survival was assessed in a series of 50 cases of large cell lymphomas in which ploidy, proliferation, and nuclear area (NA) were measured. Ploidy was calculated by both DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and DNA histogram type (DHT). Proliferation was calculated from the proportion of S phase (SPF) cells present in the DHT. These four parameters were measured using image cytometry of Feulgen-stained nuclei from fine-needle aspirations. To characterize the relationship with survival, these parameters were associated with the clinical follow-up of the patients. The results show that of the 50 LCL cases, only 5 were clearly aneuploid, whereas the remaining 45 were either diploid (29 cases), tetraploid/hypotetraploid (13 cases), or weakly aneuploid (hyperdiploid, 3 cases). Of the 34 patients who died from their disease, both smaller NA and DI correlated with longer survival in an equivalent fashion; neither conferred greater sensitivity when combined with the other. The SPF did not correlate with survival. In LCL, aneuploidy seems to be a relatively uncommon event, but when present ploidy measurement appears useful to define prognosis.",M2

The clinico-pathological features that are presently used to assess patient prognosis are not sufficient to define gastric tumor behavior. Therefore, an accurate analysis of different biological characteristics of gastric cancer cells could allow the course of disease to be predicted and may help to improve treatment strategies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The prognostic values of DNA ploidy, proliferative activity and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression were studied in gastric tumors from a series of 63 patients. DNA ploidy and proliferative activity, evaluated in terms of DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and proliferative index (PI), respectively, were determined by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. EGF-R expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor sections of the same specimens. The clinico-pathological and the biological parameters were then correlated, and the patients overall survival was calculated using a chi-square test and the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: DNA ploidy abnormal cell clones were found in 44% of cases (median DI = 1.4, range 1.04-2.5). Aneuploid tumors showed high PI more frequently than diploids (71% versus 36%, p = 0.01). The analysis of the expression of EGF-R revealed that 88% of aneuploid tumors were positive for receptor expression. On the contrary, diploid tumors showed the presence of EGF-R only in 56% of cases (p = 0.01). DI, PI, and EGF-R expression were not related to histological grade. Conversely, the three biological parameters were significantly correlated to clinical stage and tumor invasion. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a 73% 5-year survival rate in patients with diploid tumors whereas only 33% of patients with aneuploid lesions had a good prognosis (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that DNA ploidy, PI, and EGF-R expression are closely related to some pathological and clinical characteristics in gastric cancer. The close relationship between aneuploidy, EGF-R positive expression, node involvement, and tumor invasion suggests that these parameters may be indicators of high malignancy. Finally, the results also show that aneuploidy and EGF-R-positive expression are indicative of a worse prognosis in gastric cancer patients. The study of these parameters might allow a more accurate stratification of patients, so that a targeted therapeutic protocol may be defined.",M2
7729134,"DNA ploidy in testicular germ cell tumors: can an atypical seminoma be identified?Recent immunohistochemical and DNA ploidy analyses indicate that seminoma serves as a precursor to nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. It is believed that tumor progression from classical seminoma to nonseminoma is accompanied by inactivation and deletion of genetic material, and that these deletions are reflected in DNA ploidy. Twenty-three primary testicular germ cell tumors were studied by DNA flow cytometry to investigate whether a proposed histologic intermediate  atypical seminoma  (AS) could be separated from classical seminoma by ploidy analysis. The mean DNA indices (<e>DI</e>) for classical seminoma (N = 16), atypical seminoma (N = 5), and nonseminoma (N = 2; both embryonal carcinoma) were 1.53, 1.34, and 1.35, respectively. When a single  outlier  case of atypical seminoma was removed from consideration the mean DI for the AS rose to 1.45. This data is consistent with the interpretation of atypical seminoma as an intermediate between classical seminoma (CS) and embryonal carcinoma (ES). It suggests that genetic deletions characterizing progression from CS to nonseminoma may, in part, already be extant in atypical seminoma.",M2
7821913,"Image cytometry determination of ploidy level, proliferative activity, and nuclear size in a series of 314 transitional bladder cell carcinomas.Image cytometry was carried out on 281 superficial (Ta and T1) and 33 invasive (T2 to T4) bladder cancers. The parameters used to characterize these bladder tumors were: (1) histopathological grading, (2) clinical staging, (3) tumor size, (4) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) index (<e>DI</e>), (5) DNA histogram type (DHT), (6) percentage of euploid (diploid plus tetraploid) cells, (7) percentage of polyploid cells (&gt; 5C DNA content), (8) proliferative activity (S phase fraction value), and (9) nuclear area (NA). The proliferative activity of the tumors was not related to either histopathological grade or to clinical stage, but it was related to the DHT parameter, which made it possible to identify diploid, hyperdiploid, triploid, hypertriploid, tetraploid, and polymorphic tumors. The hypertriploid tumors exhibited a significantly lower proliferative activity than the nonhypertriploid ones. Although both the DI and the NA values correlated significantly with histopathological grading, only the NA values correlated significantly with clinical staging. We further observed that some grade III bladder tumors were definitely diploid, whereas some grade I tumors were highly aneuploid. We thus hypothesize that the ploidy level of a given tumor reflects its age directly and its aggressiveness only very indirectly. In our opinion aneuploidy is only an indirect marker of aggressiveness because it reflects the fact that a malignant tumor is old, ie, has been present in a patient over a long period of time and has had ample time to express its malignancy at the clinical level. A significant relationship was accordingly obtained between tumor size and ploidy level with the highest proportion of aneuploid tumors and the highest percentage of polyploid cell nuclei being observed among the largest bladder tumors.",M2
7731942,"DNA image cytometry and the expression of proliferative markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67) in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.We have analyzed DNA content and proliferative activity in morphologically defined cell subpopulations of 74 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and 29 reactive lymph nodes using DNA image cytometry and antibodies to proliferative markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67). Thirteen (18.6%) of 70 NHL cases were aneuploid. The follicular center cell-derived lymphomas with DNA aneuploidy had DNA indices (<e>DI</e>) predominantly in the tetraploid region, whereas aneuploid high-grade (HG) NHL presented DNA histograms with multiple aneuploid stemlines. In aneuploid centrocytic-centroblastic (CB/CC) NHLs, DNA aneuploidy was found exclusively in centroblasts, whereas centrocytes in these cases were diploid. Percentages of cells in S and G2/M phase in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), immunocytoma (IC), centrocytic NHL (CC), and centrocytes from CB/CC were low (&lt; 5%), whereas the respective values for centroblasts in CB/CC and in malignant cells of HG NHL were similar to those of large lymphoid cells in the reactive lymph nodes (mean, 39.5%, 36.6%, and 53.5%, respectively). The mean percentage of PCNA positive cells in CLL, IC, and CC was 4.9%. In the follicles of CB/CC NHLs there was, on average, 56.9% of PCNA positive centroblasts and 8.1% of PCNA positive centrocytes. In HG NHL, the mean percentage of PCNA positive lymphoma cells was 27.9%. A positive correlation was found between percentages of cells in S and G2/M phase and cells positive for PCNA (P &lt; 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between percentages of Ki67 (mean, 19.2%) and PCNA positive cells (mean, 17.7%) (P &lt; 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
7640448,"Prophylactic portal infusion chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for the prevention of metachronous liver metastasis in colorectal cancer.The DNA ploidy and DNA indices (<e>DI</e>) of 414 patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed, and the incidence of patients with metachronous liver metastasis was found to be significantly higher in those with aneuploid tumors and a DI above 1.5 than in those with aneuploid tumors and a DI below 1.4, or in those with diploid tumors and a DI equal to 1.0. Next, to confirm the effectiveness of administering prophylactic portal infusion chemotherapy (PPIC) as adjuvant therapy for the prevention of metachronous liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, a randomized controlled trial of PPIC was performed on 110 consecutive patients with primary colorectal cancer who had undergone curative resection. Although the incidence of patients with metachronous liver metastasis in the two study groups was not significantly different at 3.3% in the PPIC group and 10.3% in the control group, the incidence in the patients with aneuploidy and a DI above 1.5 was significantly lower in the PPIC group than in the control group. These findings suggest that colorectal cancer with aneuploidy and a DI above 1.5 may have a strong tendency to metastasize to the liver, and that prophylactic portal infusion chemotherapy may be effective for preventing metachronous liver metastasis in such patients.",M2
7532932,"Introduction of the cytological grading, the nuclear area, the DNA index and the DNA histogram type in the setting up of a score for ductal breast carcinoma.The present study describes the setting up of a new score which makes it possible objectively to grade ductal breast carcinomas, i.e. not-otherwise-specified (NOS) cancers, on cellular material from fine-needle aspirations (FNAs). For this purpose FNAs from 252 patients--with NOS breast cancers--were smeared onto histological slides, fixed in an ethanol-formolacetic acid mixture, Feulgen-stained and analysed by means of a cell image processor. Four parameters were taken into account in setting up the score, namely the cytological prognostic grade (CPM) of malignancies similar to the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grading, the nuclear area (NA), the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and the DNA histogram type (DHT). Each of these four parameters was considered as a  sub-score  which may take three values, i.e. 1, 2 and 3. The final result may thus range from 4 to 12. Subscores of 4 and 5 correspond to a cytological score of I, subscores of 6, 7 and 8 to a cytological score of II, sub-scores of 9 and 10 to a cytological score of III, and sub-scores of 11 and 12 to a cytological score of IV. In the present study, the results show 17% of CPM grade 1.52% of CPM grade II and 31% of CPM grade III cancers. All the cases exhibiting a cytological score of IV (5%) fully fit in with the CPM grade III cancers. In the same way, none of the cases exhibiting a score of I fit in with CPM grade III cancers. The cancers with a CPM grade II fit in with the scores of II and III. It thus seems possible to convert a three-value malignancy grading system (CPM and/or SBR grading) into a four-value one (cytological score). The main advantage in this latter type of system is that it becomes possible to split up the over-large group of CPM grade II cancers. As things stand, we are unable to give any prognostic value for the score proposed here because our study is prospective only. A study of this type has been necessary so as to provide against problems connected with ways of preserving specimens that might be used in a retrospective study. The bank of clinical and biological data now in existence must be allowed to mature for a number of years before the prognostic worth of the cytological score can be established, always assuming that such a value exists.",M2
8088604,"DNA content as prognostic factor in cervix carcinoma stage IB-III treated with radiotherapy.A prognostic value of DNA content in cervix carcinoma for local recurrence following radiotherapy is suggested by both retro- and prospective studies. The purpose of this study was to confirm these data. Flow cytometry and computerized image cytometry were used to measure DNA content of tumor cells retrospectively in paraffin-embedded archive material from 98 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix FIGO stage IB-III. All patients were treated with combined megavoltage irradiation and brachytherapy. Minimum follow-up has been 5.1 years. Pelvic recurrence was seen in 10, 26, and 54% of patients with stages IB II, and III, respectively (P = 0.003). DNA content, expressed as DNA index (<e>DI</e>), was not correlated with the FIGO stage (P = 0.25), histopathologic grading (P = 0.26), or age (P = 0.63) at diagnosis in this series. Using univariate analysis pelvic disease-free survival (PDFS) was best predicted by the clinical stage (P = 0.004) and by an age greater than 55 years (P = 0.04) before treatment. PDFS tended to be better for patients with aneuploid tumors (DI &gt; 1.2), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). Using Cox's regression model for multivariate analysis, only stage was independently correlated to PDFS (P = 0.009). After stratification for stage, ploidy level was significantly correlated with PDFS in stage II patients (P = 0.04). Overall results suggest aneuploid tumors to be more radiosensitive than diploid tumors in this series.",M2
7959969,"Heterogeneity in DNA content &amp; proliferative status of human brain tumours.Intra-tumour and inter-tumour heterogeneity in the cytokinetic organization was studied in 235 primary human brain tumours. DNA index (<e>DI</e>; relative tumour cell DNA content) and proliferating fraction (%PF; a measure of proliferative status) were analyzed in tumour biopsy by flow cytometry using a DNA specific fluorochrome (DAPI) and internal standards (chicken erythrocytes, CE). Incidence of micronuclei was studied in tumour biopsy tissue as well as in explants maintained in organ culture. Clonal diversity (implied by the presence of multiple peaks in the DNA histograms) was highest among medulloblastomas (44%) followed by gliomas (19%) and meningiomas (14%). Nearly 85 per cent of the malignant gliomas analyzed (histological grade III/IV) exhibited a great deal of regional variation in the proliferative status as well as micronuclei frequency as compared to meningiomas. Inter-tumoural variations in the DNA content was highest among gliomas (0.9 &lt; DI &lt; 3.6) and lowest among schwannomas (1.7 &lt; DI &lt; 2.2). Similarly, the distribution of %PF values was also broader (10-49%) in gliomas as compared to the other primary brain tumours (5-36%). Analysis of tumours taking both DI and %PF values improved the ability to discern histologically graded low and high tumours. Analysis of clonal diversity and spatial heterogeneity in the cytokinetic parameters could complement the clinicopathological findings in assessing the biological behaviour of human brain tumours, facilitating the prognostification and design of otpimal treatment regimen.",M2
8054280,"Progression and survival in prostatic adenocarcinoma: a comparison of clinical stage, Gleason grade, S-phase fraction and DNA ploidy.Clinical data were reviewed in 325 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma followed up for a mean of 13 years. Paraffin-embedded tumour biopsy specimens from the primary tumours were available for flow cytometry (FCM) in 273 cases. Intra-tumour heterogeneity in DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was found in 4% of the tumours (54 cases were analysed). S-phase fraction (SPF) and DNA ploidy were significantly interrelated. Aneuploidy and high SPF were significantly related to both a high T category and high Gleason score. The progression in T1-2M0 tumours was related to Gleason score (P = 0.009), DNA ploidy (P = 0.006) and SPF (P = 0.007), while the Gleason score (P = 0.0013), DNA ploidy (P = 0.002) and SPF (P &lt; 0.001) had prognostic value in univariate survival analysis. In the entire cohort, the T category (P &lt; 0.001), M category (P &lt; 0.001), Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), DNA ploidy (P &lt; 0.001) and SPF (P &lt; 0.001) were significant prognostic factors. In Cox's analysis, the M category (P &lt; 0.001), Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), T category (P = 0.003), age (P = 0.001) and SPF (P = 0.087) were independently related to prognosis. In the T1-2M0 tumours, Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), T category (P = 0.022) and SPF (P = 0.058) were independent predictors. A novel classification system in which the DNA ploidy or SPF and the Gleason score were combined was found to be of significant prognostic value in all M0 tumours (P &lt; 0.001). The results suggest that FCM can be used as an adjunct to conventional histological assessments for determination of the correct prognostic category in prostatic adenocarcinoma.",M2
8026828,"Determination of DNA ploidy, nuclear size, and proliferative activity by means of the computer-assisted image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei in 68 soft tissue tumors of adults.The diagnostic values of the ploidy level, the proliferative activity, and the nuclear size in a series of 68 soft tissue tumors of adults were determined by digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA ploidy level was characterized by calculating the DNA index (<e>DI</e>) and the percentage of the diploid and polyploid cells, and by typing the DNA histogram. Proliferative activity assessments were a function of the determination of the proliferation index (PI), ie, the percentage of cells engaged in the S phase of the cell cycle (SPF value). The present series included 19 benign and 49 malignant soft tissue tumors. The results show that DNA aneuploidy, as assessed by both the DI and the DNA histogram type, cannot be used as a discriminatory parameter for distinguishing between benign and malignant soft tissue tumors. Indeed, some benign cases may be highly aneuploid, whereas some highly malignant soft tissue tumors may be definitely diploid. In contrast, the determination of the percentage of polyploid cell nuclei seems to be a useful parameter in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. In fact, the benign soft tissue tumors showed a very significantly lower mean percentage value of polyploid cell nuclei than the malignant cases. The determination of the proliferative activity also discriminated significantly between the benign and the malignant cases, the former proliferating more slowly than the latter. Lastly, the determination of nuclear size made it possible to differentiate the primary malignant soft tissue tumors, whether recurrent or not, that were associated with metastasis from those free of metastasis.",M2
7947621,"Malignant gliomas--ploidy and DNA-content before and after therapy.DNA ploidy and S-phase percentage from nine malignant gliomas (four glioblastomas, four anaplastic astrocytomas grade 3 and one anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grade 3) have been estimated by single cell cytophotometry on biopsy and necropsy specimens. All gliomas from biopsy material showed, with the exception of two diploid tumours, a polyploid-aneuploid DNA-pattern and stem-lines of different ploidy. The most frequent stem-lines were diploid and hyperdiploid. In necropsy material, following treatment i.e. operation and combined drug and radiation therapy, the heterogeneous nature of all malignant gliomas persisted. From seven aneuploid-polyploid gliomas four showed an elevation and three of them a decrease of <e>DI</e> values. Diploid tumors remained diploid. Because of marked heterogeneity of ploidy patterns and the small number of tumors investigated, ploidy changes could not be used for estimation of therapy efficacy and prognosis. Further studies will be necessary to answer this question.",M2
8198978,"DNA ploidy and proliferative activity (S-phase) in childhood soft-tissue sarcomas: their value as prognostic indicators.The value of DNA ploidy as a prognostic indicator is well established in many cancers, but recent studies in childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have been contradictory. In a retrospective study of 128 cases of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) diagnosed since 1980, the prognostic value of clinical, histological and flow cytometric parameters was compared, using univariate and multivariate methods. Eighty-one RMSs, 18 extraosseous Ewing's (EOE)/peripheral neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) and 29 other non-RMS STSs were histologically and clinically reviewed. Five year actuarial survival was 63.4% for all STSs and 69.4% for RMSs. Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were available for flow cytometry in 90 cases. Of the RMSs, 65.5% were aneuploid [DNA index (<e>DI</e>) &gt; 1.1] compared with 23% of the EOE/PNETs and 31% of non-RMS STSs. Median S-phase was also significantly higher in RMSs (17.0%) than in other STSs (10.8%) (P = 0.0023). Univariate analysis in RMSs showed that stage, ploidy status, S-phase, site and tumour size all had a significant impact on survival. In multivariate analysis of 59 cases of RMS, one clinical and two flow cytometric parameters were independently associated with poor prognosis. These were stage (IV), nonhyperdiploidy (DI &lt; 1.10 and &gt; 1.8) and a high rate of proliferative activity (S-phase &gt; 14.0%). These results confirm that ploidy and S-phase are important new prognostic indicators in rhabdomyosarcoma.",M2
7984517,"DNA ploidy in carcinoma of the gallbladder. Prognostic significance and comparison of flow and image cytometry on archival tumor material.The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the cytometrically assessed DNA ploidy is a parameter of prognostic significance in gallbladder carcinomas. For this purpose the DNA content of tumor cells from archival tumor material from 80 patients with cholecystic cancer was analysed retrospectively by using comparatively different cytometrical methods, namely flow cytometry (FCM) and image cytometry, using tissue sections (ICM-S) and nuclear suspensions (ICM-N). Conventional tumor classifications (according to pTNM and Nevin) were able to predict the further clinical course. DNA ploidy showed a statistically significant correlation only to histological grade (P &lt; 0.001), but not to tumor stage and survival. Only a trend towards a poorer outcome for patients harboring non-diploid tumors became evident especially when no residual tumor was present postoperatively (R 0-stage; P = 0.08). The different cytometrical methods discussed in detail, showed a highly significant concordance in the determination of DNA index values (<e>DI</e>) and in the classification of the tumors as either diploid or non-diploid. In conclusion, our results indicate that cytometrical determination of DNA ploidy provides no further prognostic informations in gallbladder carcinomas as compared to conventional tumor staging.",M2
8203928,"[DNA heterogeneity and its significance in colon carcinoma]We performed DNA flow cytometry analysis of colon carcinomas from the viewpoint of DNA heterogeneity. The materials were 25 colon carcinomas and 17 metastatic lymph nodes. Four different regions were examined in each primary tumor. The DNA index (<e>DI</e>) was classified into four groups. We classified the primary tumors into homogeneous and heterogeneous group according to the DI of the four regions of each case. Ten of 25 (40%) were classified as homogeneous and 15 (60%) as heterogeneous. The heterogeneous group tended to show more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics. The corresponding rate between the maximum DI in the primary tumor and the DI in the metastatic lymph node was 65% (11/17). The maximum DI of the primary tumors was mostly seen in the metastatic lymph nodes, suggesting high metastatic potentiality of the higher DI clones. The examination of DNA heterogeneity may be useful for detecting the more precise character of the colon carcinomas. In heterogeneous cases, the higher corresponding rate of DI between primary and metastatic lesions suggested that metastasis occurred frequently in primary lesions containing gathering larger DI cells.",M2

In 25 of 30 cases (83.3%), all DI observed in Group B were also found in Group A; and in the remaining 5 cases, a series of DI not found in Group A were observed in group B. They were all poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, 4 of which exhibited serosal invasion and prominent lymphatic permeation in their wall. In 28 cases (93.3%), the modal DI value in the primary tumor was also found in their corresponding metastatic lymph node, the frequency of which revealed a statistically significant difference from 18 cases (60%) in terms of median DI value, and from 10 cases (33.3%) in terms of maximum DI value (p &lt; 0.01). It was suggested that the modal DI value in the primary tumor could signify an important clone relating to lymph node metastasis.

8008738,"Role of DNA content determination by image analysis in confirmation of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.Progression to cancer in Barrett's esophageal columnar metaplasia is classically heralded by the presence of epithelial dysplasia. Differentiation of reactive epithelial atypia and mild dysplasia from severe dysplasia, however, may often be difficult especially with limited biopsy material. We performed DNA content analysis of 11 cases of Barrett's esophagus showing variable reactive atypia, 24 cases of Barrett's with low- and high-grade dysplasia, and 30 cases of Barrett's with invasive adenocarcinoma (BCA) using Feulgen-stained paraffin sections and the CAS 200 image analyzer. The mean DNA index of the uniformly diploid BE was 1.06. The 1.26 mean DNA index for the low-grade Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia, 1.62 for high grade, and 1.88 <e>DI</e> for BCA were significantly greater than for variable reactive atypia (P &lt; 0.004) but not different from each other. Six BCA cases (20%) were diploid; 24 cases (80%) were aneuploid. Mean survival of diploid BCA at 20.4 mo was nearly double the survival of 10.6 mo for aneuploid BCA. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P &lt; 0.21) and survival at 3 yr was identical for all BCA cases. Tumor grade, stage, and lymph node status did not significantly correlate with ploidy pattern. Thus, although DNA analysis does not seem to predict ultimate outcome in BCA, aneuploidy and high DNA index are associated with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia and BCA and may be of significant value in the differentiation from variable reactive atypia in small biopsies.",M2
8008736,"Relationship of nuclear DNA content to clinicopathologic features in colorectal cancer.Nuclear DNA content was determined in 123 colorectal adenocarcinomas by flow cytometry using multiple frozen tumor samples. Thirty-three (26.8%) carcinomas were classified as diploid and 90 as aneuploid (73.2%). Presence of DNA aneuploidy was found to be unrelated to tumor stage and grade of differentiation and to other histopathological variables such as pattern of growth, degree of peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration, and venous invasion. However, multiploid tumors (20/123, 16.3%) were more frequently noted in advanced stages of disease (Stages III and IV, P &lt; 0.025) and more often showed unfavorable histopathological features, especially an infiltrating pattern of growth (P &lt; 0.05), compared with diploid and single aneuploid carcinomas. Nuclear DNA content was found to be closely related to tumor site. Carcinomas of the proximal (right and transverse) colon were more frequently diploid (19/43, 44.2% versus 14/80, 17.5%--P &lt; 0.005) and more often displayed a DNA index (<e>DI</e>, defined as the ratio of the DNA content of neoplastic cells to that of normal cells) &lt; or = 1.20 (27/43, 62.8% versus 19/80, 23.7%--P &lt; 0.001) than did tumors localized distally to the splenic flexure. Nuclear DNA content was also found to be related to tumor type. A high proportion of mucinous adenocarcinomas showed DI values &lt; or = 1.20 (14/21, 66.7%); conversely only 32 of 102 (31.4%) non-mucinous adenocarcinomas had a DI &lt; or = 1.20 (P &lt; 0.01).

8262673,"Flow cytometric DNA ploidy defines patients with poor prognosis in node-negative breast cancer.Flow cytometric DNA analysis was performed on fine-needle aspirates from frozen tumour biopsies from 421 node-negative, non-adjuvantly-treated breast-cancer patients with a median observation time of 6.75 years. Among premenopausal patients (n = 175), those having at least one DNA  hypoploid  subpopulation defined as DNA index (<e>DI</e>) &lt; 0.96 or 1.44 &lt; or = 1.92 (n = 81) were characterized by early recurrences (log-rank p = 0.05), Wilcoxon p = 0.007), poor overall survival (OS) (p &lt; 0.001) and poor survival after recurrence (p &lt; 0.001). In the postmenopausal group (n = 246), there were no significant difference among 7 different DI classes regarding either recurrence-free survival (RFS) or OS. S-phase fraction (SPF), divided into quartiles, predicted OS in premenopausal patients only (p = 0.02). Conventional multivariate Cox analysis of OS in the premenopausal group revealed hypoploidy to be the only independent prognostic factor involving a relative risk (RR) of 22.8. Age &lt; or = 40 years was of marginal significance, whereas SPF, histological grade (WHO), oestrogen and progesterone receptor (PgR) content, tumour size and number of lymph nodes removed were excluded from the model. Application of the conventional Cox model to the premenopausal group regarding RFS was found inappropriate due to lack of proportionality of the hazards of hypoploidy due to lack of proportionately of the hazards of hypoploidy, SPF and histological grade. However, introduction of time-dependent co-variates using 2 years as cut-off level showed hypoploidy with a RR of 3.52 and age &lt; or = 40 years with a RR of 3.28 to be independent prognostic factors. In the postmenopausal group, the conventional Cox model identified the number of lymph nodes removed to be the only independent prognostic factor regarding RFS as well as OS, whereas SPF &lt; 9% (lowest quartile) was of marginal significance in RFS analysis. Hypoploidy was correlated to high SPF, low PgR content and low differentiation, indicating that hypoploid tumours proliferate rapidly and hormone-independently. These patients may therefore benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy administered while tumour burden and risk of drug resistance are still low.",M2
8054769,"An evaluation of the flow cytometric nuclear DNA analysis of intrahepatic multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma for a diagnosis of their multicentricity.This study aims to evaluate the clinical significance of the nuclear DNA index (<e>DI</e>) for identification of multicentrically occurring (MC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 14 multinodular HCC patients, the DI of 30 HCC specimens and 14 non-cancerous liver tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histological studies of the 30 HCCs revealed MC in 6 cases and intrahepatic metastasis (IM) in 7 cases except for a histologically undetermined case who was found to be a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier, and the MC of this case was determined by a clonal study using the HBV integration pattern. In four of the seven specimens with MC HCC, the DI of all the intrahepatic tumors was 1.0 (diploid pattern), while the remaining three were different. On the other hand, five of the seven IM cases were identical (3 diploid and 2 aneuploid), one similar level (DI = 1.17-1.18) and one different (1.0 and 1.24). Moreover, in one IM case, the possibility of an alteration of the DI during the course of HCC development was investigated. Although the DI of the recurrent main tumor (DI = 1.17) of this case, which was identified as metastasis of the primary tumor by a clonal study, was also similar to that of subsequent metastatic lesions (DI = 1.18), the DI of the primary tumor was 1.0. These results indicate that DI analysis was not enough to make a differential diagnosis of the multicentric occurrence of HCC.",M2
8137213,"Flow cytometric DNA ploidy and S-phase heterogeneity in advanced ovarian carcinoma.BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of flow cytometric DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) in ovarian cancer has been controversial. In the current study, the authors analyzed tumor heterogeneity in respect to DNA index <e>DI</e> and SPF. METHODS: Flow cytometric variation in DI and SPF among representative fresh tumor material from the primary tumor, metastasis, and malignant effusions from the same patient was analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two samples from 47 patients were analyzed, and 119 samples from 42 patients were evaluable. Stable DI between different samples was found in 34 patients, whereas heterogeneity was found in 8 patients (19%). The metastases showed stable DNA content. The malignant effusion samples often lacked tumor cells. The representative ones were often DNA diploid. In 21% of the aneuploid samples, the SPF could not be analyzed. In 38% of the aneuploid samples, the stem line constituted less than 15% of measured nuclei. In these samples, a negative correlation between SPF and percentage of aneuploid cells was found, making SPF unreliable. Correct SPF measurement was thus possible in only 41% of the aneuploid samples, and in these tumors, SPF values varied considerably among different samples from the same patient, illustrated by a median SPF difference of 11% (range, 0-28%). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor DI heterogeneity existed in 19% of tumors. SPF depended on the amount of aneuploid cells in case of small stem lines and varied considerably, making its use as a prognostic factor doubtful. To ensure that all tumor stem lines are represented, at least two biopsy specimens from any solid tumor should be analyzed.",M2

In the present investigation we have evaluated the nuclear DNA content in 123 colorectal adenocarcinomas by flow cytometry using multiple frozen tumour samples. Thirty-three (26.8%) carcinomas were classified as diploid and 90 as aneuploid (73.2%). Presence of DNA aneuploidy was found to be unrelated to age and sex of patients, tumour stage and grade of differentiation, as well as to several other histopathological variables. However, multiploid tumours (20/123, 16.3%) resulted to be more frequently in advanced stages of disease (stages III and IV, P &lt; 0.025) and more often showed unfavourable histopathological features, especially an infiltrating pattern of growth (P &lt; 0.05), compared to diploid and single aneuploid carcinomas. Nuclear DNA content was found to be closely related to tumour site. Carcinomas of the proximal colon were more frequently diploid (P &lt; 0.005) and more often displayed a <e>DI</e> &lt; or = 1.20 (P &lt; 0.001) than tumours of the distal colon. Nuclear DNA content was also found to be related to tumour type. In fact, a high proportion (66.7%) of mucinous carcinomas showed DI values &lt; or = 1.20; conversely only 31.4% of nonmucinous adenocarcinomas had a DI &lt; or = 1.20 (P &lt; 0.01). Intratumoural heterogeneity in nuclear DNA content was found in 23% of cases. These results seem to suggest that the DNA ploidy pattern probably reflects different genetic mechanisms involved in the development of carcinomas in the proximal and distal colon. Furthermore our data support the hypothesis that mucinous carcinoma represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity, possibly related to pathogenetic factors different from those acting in the majority of nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. Finally, the analysis of multiple tissue samples taken from different areas of each tumour is necessary to assess carefully the DNA ploidy pattern of large bowel carcinomas.",M2
