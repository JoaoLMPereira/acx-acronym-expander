20450308,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>): an association of pulverulent cataracts and pseudo-dominant developmental delay in a family with a splice site mutation in CYP27A1--a case report.PURPOSE: A 15-year-old boy with developmental delay presented to the pediatric ophthalmology clinic with bilateral pulverulent cataracts. The family was examined for developmental delay, cataracts and systemic problems. METHODS: The parents were consanguineous and originally from Bangladesh. All the children were born in the UK. The mother and 5 children had developmental delay. Three children had global developmental delay, diarrhea and pulverulent cataracts. Two children had microcephaly, developmental delay, constipation and no cataracts. The mother did not have microcephaly, cataracts or gastrointestinal problems. Linkage analysis via autozygosity testing was performed for detection of loci and candidate genes. The patients with cataracts were segregated with homozygous mutations in the CYP27A1 (G to A substitution at position +1 of intron 6). RESULTS: The complex nature of this family's findings suggested that it had an unusual autosomal dominant condition with variable expression. Autozygosity testing demonstrated that three members had Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The aetiology of the developmental delay in other family members remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive condition that can result in neurological deficits and early death if left untreated. In view of the reversible nature of the condition with appropriate treatment, there needs to be a high level of suspicion of CTX for any child with cataracts and developmental delay even if the pattern of inheritance is not straightforward at initial assessment.",M1
20414172,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with severe externalized disorder: improvement after one year of treatment with chenodeoxycholic Acid.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare inborn disorder of sterol storage with autosomal recessive inheritance and a variable clinical presentation. We describe two siblings with an early psychiatric presentation of CTX-associated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also associated with a mild intellectual disability and major behavioral impairments. In both cases, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid improved externalized symptoms and a partial recovery of cognitive impairments was observed. This suggests that CTX is potentially reversible, demonstrating the need for early diagnosis and treatment of this disorder before irreversible neurological lesions can occur.",M1
19808031,"ESI-MS/MS quantification of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one facilitates rapid, convenient diagnostic testing for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.BACKGROUND: The genetic disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) frequently remains undiagnosed for many years. Left untreated CTX is associated with the development of cataracts, xanthomas and severe neurological dysfunction. The method routinely used to screen for CTX is GC-based measurement of elevated 5alpha-cholestanol from hydrolyzed plasma. A plasma test for CTX utilizing ESI-MS/MS methodology would be beneficial. METHODS: Development of rapid, simple LC-ESI-MS/MS methodology to test plasma for CTX is described. Two hour Girard derivatization allowed for 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one quantification by isotope dilution LC-ESI-MS/MS within 12 min from un-hydrolyzed affected patient plasma (5 microl). RESULTS: Adequate sensitivity and reproducibility were achieved for quantification of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, which demonstrated improved utility as a diagnostic marker of disease and to monitor treatment compared to 5alpha-cholestanol. The mean plasma concentration of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in untreated CTX-affected patients (n=6) was 107-fold that in unaffected subjects (n=9), with the lowest concentration in affected patients &gt;10-fold the highest concentration in unaffected subjects. CONCLUSION: Quantification of the bile acid precursor 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one with LC-ESI-MS/MS is a novel approach to improved diagnostic testing of plasma for CTX, amenable to high-throughput analysis and automated sample handling. Development of ESI-MS/MS methodology should make CTX testing more widely available and facilitate easier diagnosis of CTX.",M1
19696711,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>): a treatable lipid storage disease.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease with multi-organ involvement. The clinical manifestations usually start at infancy and develop during the first and second decades of life; infantile-onset diarrhea may be the earliest clinical manifestation of CTX. Additional clinical manifestations are juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and multiple progressive neurological symptoms. Systemic manifestations that are often found include osteoporosis, heart involvement and premature arteriosclerosis. CTX is caused by mutations in the sterol 27 hydroxylase gene (CYP27) on chromosome 2q35-qter, which is responsible for conversion of cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid. Reduced synthesis of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid results in failed feedback inhibition of cholesterol production, which in turn leads to increased serum cholestanol concentration and elevated urinary bile alcohols. Early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) prevents the clinical symptoms and prevents deterioration. Although CTX is rare world wide, genetic islands of high frequency have been reported. In this review we would like to familiarize the reader with this fatal inborn error of metabolism that is possibly under-diagnosed and is preventable once recognized and treated.",M1
19457308,"[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of 4 patients]Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is an uncommon autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of the CYP27A1 gene. It is characterized by the presence of xanthomas in different tissues, principally brain and tendon, due to the accumulation of beta-cholestanol. Diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of serum beta-cholestanol and urinary bile alcohol levels. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid has been shown to be the most effective treatment and can halt progression of the disease. We present 4 patients with a history of neurological disorders since childhood and who were diagnosed with CTX after developing tendon xanthomas. Although diagnostic suspicion depends to a large extent on recognition of tendon xanthomas, these are not an early sign of the disease, which can present with neurological disorders, cataracts, and chronic diarrhea. Early diagnosis of CTX therefore rests on measurement of serum beta-cholestanol levels, even in absence of tendon xanthomas.",M1

17697869,"Mutational analysis of CYP27A1: assessment of 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D.The CYP27A1 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that modulates the acidic biosynthetic pathway for bile acids beginning with the 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol. CYP27A1 also 25-hydroxylates vitamin D(3). Gene mutations cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), an autosomal recessive disorder, and may cause 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and early-onset osteoporosis and fractures in affected patients. To examine the effects of mutations of CYP27A1 on vitamin D and cholesterol hydroxylating activity, recombinant CYP27A1 and mutant complementary DNAs produced by site-directed mutagenesis were stably expressed in either Escherichia coli or COS-1 cells. Activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined with cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alphaOHD(3)) as substrates. Of the 15 mutants tested, 11 expressed protein and 4 expressed little or no protein. Functional heme activity, estimated by reduced CO difference spectra at 450 nm, was absent in 12 mutants. When expressed in E. coli, 3 mutants, K226R, D321G, and P408S, each known to cause clinically CTX, showed modest decreases in reduced CO spectra peak and either no change or decreases of less than 50% in hydroxylation of cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and 1alphaOHD(3) compared with wild type. When expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, each of these mutants showed 25-hydroxylation activity for 1alphaOHD(3) as well as wild type. Thus, 3 mutants, K226R, D321G, and P408S, known to occur clinically with nonfunctioning mutants, hydroxylated cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and 1alphaOHD(3). How they contribute to the pathogenesis of CTX despite being biologically active in vitro remains to be determined.",M1
17603722,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Saudi Arabian family-genotyping and long-term follow-up.A Saudi Arabian family is described in which there were 2 siblings with typical features of cerebral xanthomatosis <e>CTX</e> including premature cataracts, xanthomata of the Achilles tendons, neuro-psychiatric disturbances, and atherosclerosis. The 2 patients were homozygous for a point mutation in the mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase gene CYP27A1, OMIM 606530 located in the splice site of intron 6, where G was exchanged for A IVS6+1G&gt;A. Their parents were cousins, 5 siblings were healthy, 2 were heterozygous for the mutation, and one showed the wild-type genotype. The father was heterozygous for the mutation, while the other family members were not tested. The progress of the 2 CTX patients over 14 years is described; firstly when they were receiving treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid; when this medication was not available, and later when it was restored. A hereditary hyperlipidemia was also present in this family. It is suggested that when this occurs with CTX, a more serious illness results that merits more aggressive dual therapy.",M1
17553741,"Rifampicin-induced CYP3A4 activation in <e>CTX</e> patients cannot replace chenodeoxycholic acid treatment.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with cholestanol accumulation resulting from mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A). Conventional treatment includes chenodeoxycholic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Mice with disrupted Cyp27A (Cyp27 KO) do not show elevated cholestanol levels nor develop CTX manifestations. This phenomenon was proposed to be due to murine CYP3A overexpression leading to an alternative pathway for degradation of bile alcohols including cholestanol. Our objective was to examine the influence of CYP3A4 induction on cholestanol elimination in CTX patients. Rifampicin (600 mg/day x 7 days), known to induce the PXR, and thereby to increase CYP3A activity, was used. The degree of CYP3A4 induction was assessed by comparing midazolam pharmacokinetics before and after rifampicin treatment. Cholestanol levels and cholestanol/cholesterol ratios were assayed during the experimental period and compared to a 3 weeks period without treatment. The results show that despite 60% increase in CYP3A4 activity following rifampicin treatment, there is no significant change in cholestanol levels. We conclude that up-regulated expression of CYP3A affects cholestanol elimination in mice differently as compared to its effect in CTX patients. Therefore, CYP3A4 inducers cannot replace chenodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of CTX.",M1
17444890,"Unique patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Evidence for presence of a defect in a gene that is not identical to sterol 27-hydroxylase.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder believed to be exclusively caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene coding for the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. Common findings in CTX are tendon xanthomas, cataracts and progressive neurological dysfunction. Here, we characterize an adult female patient with tendon xanthomas and classic biochemical findings of CTX (i.e. high levels of bile alcohols and cholestanol and extremely low levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in plasma). Additionally, sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in cultured monocyte-derived macrophages from this patient was &lt;5% of normal. Sequencing the CYP27A1 gene uncovered that the patient is heterozygous for two previously undescribed base substitutions in exon 8, C478A and C479A, which are expected to affect the haeme-binding domain of the enzyme. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the corresponding protein had only 8% of normal enzymatic activity. No other mutation was found in the open reading frame of the CYP27A1 gene, intron-exon boundaries or in the 5'-untranslated region up to 5000 bp distal to the translational start site. Sequencing mRNA isolated from leucocytes from the patient revealed a 1 : 1 ratio of mutated and nonmutated species, with total mRNA levels that were not significantly different from the controls. It is concluded that the patient is heterozygous for two mutations affecting one allele of the CYP27A1 gene and with at least one additional yet undefined gene that is of critical importance for the activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase.",M1
17341417,"High-throughput urine screening for Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis using negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.BACKGROUND: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) are disorders affecting cholesterol metabolism. Currently, diagnosis relies on clinical recognition and specific and complex biochemical testing. METHODS: A rapid, high-throughput urine test, suitable for mass screening for these two disorders, was developed using flow injection negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring. Cholestane-pentol glucuronide, a known marker for CTX, was measured and a steroid sulfate with a proposed keto-pregnadien-diol structure was identified and measured for SLOS. Measurement of the two markers was readily incorporated into an existing tandem mass spectrometry method for diagnosing inborn errors of amino and organic acid metabolism. RESULTS: Levels in affected patients were well separated from 1738 controls, ranging from 6.7 to 100 times the 99.7th percentile of controls in SLOS patients (n=3) and 7.3 to 24 times the 99.7th percentile of controls in CTX patients (n=4). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of testing for SLOS and CTX to a routine tandem mass spectrometry urine screening program simplifies the diagnosis of these two disorders and further extends the range of inborn errors of metabolism detected by this technique.",M1
17325385,"On the mechanism of cerebral accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.The most serious consequence of sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency in humans [cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>)] is the development of cholestanol-containing brain xanthomas. The cholestanol in the brain may be derived from the circulation or from 7alpha-hydroxylated intermediates in bile acid synthesis, present at 50- to 250-fold increased levels in plasma. Here, we demonstrate a transfer of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one across cultured porcine brain endothelial cells (a model for the blood-brain barrier) that is approximately 100-fold more efficient than the transfer of cholestanol. Furthermore, there was an efficient conversion of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to cholestanol in cultured neuronal and glial cells as well as in monocyte-derived macrophages of human origin. It is concluded that the continuous intracellular production of cholestanol from a bile acid precursor capable of rapidly passing biomembranes, including the blood-brain barrier, is likely to be of major importance for the accumulation of cholestanol in patients with CTX. Such a mechanism also fits well with the observation that treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, which normalizes the level of the bile acid precursor, results in a reduction of cholestanol-containing xanthomas even in the brain.",M1

17012751,"Cholestanol metabolism in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: absorption, turnover, and tissue deposition.To study the metabolism of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), we measured the cholestanol absorption, the cholesterol and cholestanol turnover, and the tissue content of sterols in two patients. Cholestanol absorption was approximately 5.0%. The rapid exchangeable pool of cholestanol was 233 mg, and the total exchangeable pool was 752 mg. The production rate of cholestanol in pool A was 39 mg/day. [4-14C]cholestanol was detected in the xanthomas, but neither [4-14C]cholestanol nor [4-14C]cholesterol was detected in peripheral nerves biopsied at 49 and 97 days after [4-14C]cholesterol given intravenously. Of the 18 tissues analyzed at biopsy and autopsy, the cholestanol content varied from 0.09 mg/g in psoas muscle to 76 mg/g in a cerebellar xanthoma. With the assumption that the cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio is 1.0, the relative cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio varied from 1.0 in plasma and liver to 30.0 in the cerebellar xanthoma; cholestanol was especially high in nerve tissue. Our data indicate that CTX patients absorb cholestanol from the diet. They have a higher than normal cholestanol production rate. Cholestanol was derived from cholesterol. In CTX patients, the blood-brain barrier was intact to the passage of [4-14C]cholesterol and [4-14C]cholestanol. The deposition of large amounts of cholestanol (up to 30% of total sterols in cerebellum) in nerve tissues must have an important role in the neurological symptoms in CTX patients. In view of the intact blood-brain barrier, several other explanations for the large amounts of cholestanol in the brain were postulated.",M1
16816916,"Clinical and molecular diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with a review of the mutations in the CYP27A1 gene.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to defective activity of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. In 1991, sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A1) was localised on the long arm of chromosome 2 [1]. Clinical characteristics of CTX are diarrhoea, cataracts, tendon xanthomas and neurological manifestations including dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, and seizures. More than 300 patients with CTX have been reported to date worldwide and about 50 different mutations identified in the CYP27A1 gene. Almost all mutations lead to the absence or inactive form of the sterol 27-hydroxylase. In this review, according with the aims of this section of the journal, we describe the different pathogenetic mutations in the CYP27A1 gene and the main clinical and pathogenetic aspects that may help clinical neurologists in the diagnosis of CTX.",M1
16715243,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata.We report on a case of a 36-year-old lady who presented with large, painful soft-tissue swellings of both Achilles tendons. MRI demonstrated fusiform enlargement involving the Achilles tendons bilaterally. The tendons returned heterogeneous signal intensity characterised by a diffuse reticulated appearance. The right tendon mass was treated with a wide marginal excision and Achilles tendon reconstruction. The histology confirmed Achilles tendon xanthoma. Further metabolic investigation revealed the patient to have a rare autosomal recessive condition called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>). Her brother was also affected. CTX is easily treatable if diagnosed early, and should be suspected in patients presenting with bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas and normal plasma lipid levels.",M1
16445943,"Could steroids mask the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis?Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis, caused by impaired hydroxylation of cholesterol side chains due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), leading to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in brain and other tissues. Elevated plasma cholestanol serves as a key marker for the clinical diagnosis of CTX. In the present report we describe a young man with CTX who was on high dose steroids for a misdiagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and had normal level of serum cholestanol. When steroids were discontinued, markedly elevated serum cholestanol was measured concomitant with marked clinical worsening. This observation may imply that steroids can lower plasma cholestanol, possibly by directly inducing residual CYP27A1 activity or by inducing alternative pathways for cholestanol elimination.",M1
16372260,"New insights into the pathological mechanisms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the Taiwanese using genomic and proteomic tools.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is an autosomal recessive lipid-storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase. Genetic analysis utilizing SSCP and direct DNA sequencing identified a new mutation. One base-pair of cytosine was deleted at codon 326 on exon 2 of CYP27 in all CTX patients while their father was heterozygotic. This novel point deletion predicts a frameshift in mRNA (Pro(102) --&gt;Leu) and results in the appearance of a premature termination codon (TGA) to substitute for Val(106) (GTG). To characterize the pathological mechanism of CTX patients, the protein profiles of serum and leukocytes extracted from these subjects were presented by means of proteomic technologies including 2-DE and MALDI-TOF analysis. According to the results, the amount of vinculin, ABP-280, talin and vimentin in leukocytes of CTX patients had changed significantly, reflecting the changes in membrane dynamics concerning cholestanol accumulation. The expression of target proteins in CTX patients and control was further verified by western blotting which indicated the same tendency as 2-DE data. This is the first paper to integrate both genomic and proteomic concepts for analyzing the possible mechanism of CTX and provides more information for related study in the future.",M1

We report a 53-year-old man, with an unusual phenotype of CTX. He had xanthomas since adolescence. He had no mental retardation and developed at 44 years a progressive neuropsychiatric phenotype, suggestive of fronto-temporal dementia according to clinical Neary criteria. Cataract and ataxia were absent. Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse hyperintense T2 abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter without cerebellar atrophy or lesions, while Technetium-99m-ECD brain SPECT revealed a severe cerebellar hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol level was elevated with excessive urinary bile alcohols excretion. Mutation analysis revealed that he was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene: 1016 C &gt; T (exon 5) on one allele and a novel mutation, 1435C &gt; G (exon 8) on the other allele.

16157755,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: possible higher prevalence than previously recognized.BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare but treatable neurodegenerative disorder caused by 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP27) deficiency. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features and results of genetic analysis in a family with CTX. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital. Subjects A 54-year-old woman with CTX, her family members, and 115 white control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in the affected subject; results of mutation analysis of the CYP27 coding sequence in the patient, her parents, and the control subjects. RESULTS: The proband and her affected sibling had classic features of CTX, including presenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, diarrhea, and a complex neurodegenerative disorder. They were somewhat atypical, however, because their cataracts were congenital, cognitive impairment had been noted in childhood, and the white matter involvement was more severe than usual. The proband was shown to be homozygous for CYP27 mutation R362C. Similar analysis of 115 control subjects identified 1 subject who was a heterozygous carrier for this same CYP27 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CTX due to CYP27 mutation R362C alone is approximately 1 per 50,000 among white individuals. Although the disorder is rare, this incidence is substantially greater than previously recognized. Greater awareness of CTX is important because specific treatment is available.",M1
15795599,"Mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene associated with fatal cholestasis in infancy.BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are rare but potentially treatable causes of neonatal cholestasis. We here present a cholestatic infant with an ongoing cytomegalovirus infection who despite intensive treatment died of severe liver disease at 4 months of age. METHODS: The urinary steroids were investigated by electrospray mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Oxysterols in plasma were analysed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Glucuronidated bile alcohols, which are known to be excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) were detected in the urine. Analysis of plasma revealed markedly reduced levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Mutation analysis showed the presence of a stop codon in exon 7, confirming the diagnosis of CTX, a rare disease not previously diagnosed in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal and neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX have been reported previously and the present case supports the contention that reduced activity of the sterol 27-hydroxylase may predispose to the development of neonatal cholestasis. The associated viral infection may have further precipitated the liver disease. Since CTX, like other inborn errors of bile acid synthesis may be treated with bile acids an early diagnosis is essential. Thus, the analysis of urine by electrospray mass spectrometry is highly recommended in the investigation of patients with neonatal cholestasis.",M1
15736111,"Isotopomer spectral analysis of intermediates of cholesterol synthesis in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) and 2 healthy controls received a constant proximal intraduodenal infusion of 1- 13 C-acetate as a stable-isotope-labeled marker of sterol synthesis. One patient was treated with pravastatin (20 mg twice daily) and another patient with chenodeoxycholic acid (250 mg tid). Every hour, venous blood and duodenal samples were obtained. Stable-isotope enrichment of neutral and polar sterols in serum and bile was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Isotopomer spectral analysis was performed on cholesterol, lathosterol, Delta-8-cholesterol, methylsterol, and lanosterol. Stable-isotope labeling of cholestanol, bile acids, and bile alcohols was analyzed by assessing the change over time of the ratio of M + 3 to M + 0. Eleven hours after marker infusion, we found up to 50% newly synthesized lathosterol in serum and up to 80% in bile, with similar results for other cholesterol precursors. In cholesterol, stable-isotope labeling could be demonstrated in all study subjects with a more prominent labeling in bile than in serum. No stable-isotope labeling was detected in cholestanol. Only minor stable-isotope incorporation was detectable in polar sterols in some subjects. Therapy with pravastatin did not have any effect on fractional or absolute synthesis rates or on the concentrations of cholestanol or cholesterol precursors compared to untreated patients with CTX. In contrast, therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid markedly lowered the concentrations of cholestanol and cholesterol precursors, led to a disappearance of bile alcohols, and reduced absolute synthesis rates of lathosterol. Isotopomer spectral analysis proved to be a powerful method to assess the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol precursors in patients with CTX. Higher fractional synthesis in bile than in serum may be due to the size of the pools in bile vs serum. Cholestanol exhibits no marker uptake and is therefore probably synthesized from preformed cholesterol. Biliary cholesterol secretion in patients with CTX is decreased compared to healthy controls.",M1
15576845,"Disrupted coordinate regulation of farnesoid X receptor target genes in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) deficiency, is associated with markedly reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the most powerful activating ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We investigated the effects of reduced CDCA on FXR target genes in humans. Liver specimens from an untreated CTX patient and 10 control subjects were studied. In the patient, hepatic CDCA concentration was markedly reduced but the bile alcohol level exceeded CDCA levels in control subjects (73.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.2 nmol/g liver). Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) were upregulated 84- and 8-fold, respectively. However, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump were normally expressed. Marked CYP7A1 induction with normal SHP expression was not explained by the regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) or pregnane X receptor. However, another nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), was induced 2.9-fold in CTX, which was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of HNF4alpha target genes, CYP7A1, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12alpha-hydroxylase, CYP27A1, and NTCP. In conclusion, the coordinate regulation of FXR target genes was lost in CTX. The mechanism of the disruption may be explained by a normally stimulated FXR pathway attributable to markedly increased bile alcohols with activation of HNF4alpha caused by reduced bile acids in CTX liver.",M1
15256768,"Enhanced susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modification in a <e>CTX</e> patient:- role of chenodeoxycholic acid in xanthoma formation.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial sterol storage disease, causing multiple xanthomas in tendons and the brain. The underlying biochemical defect is a lack of the hepatic mitochondrial cholesterol 27-hydroxylase involved in the normal biosynthesis of bile acid, resulting in reduced biosynthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). It has been reported that administration of CDCA to CTX patients improves neurological disorders and xanthomas of the Achilles tendon. The present study investigated the effect of CDCA on the mechanism of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, the major cells in xanthoma. The LDL from the patients in this study was significantly more susceptible to oxidative modification than normal LDL, and supplement therapy with CDCA resulted in an improvement in the susceptibility to oxidative modification. In the incubation of CDCA with plasma, 13% of the CDCA added to serum was recovered in the LDL fraction. In addition, supplementation with CDCA enhanced cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity and reduced high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the plasma. This evidence suggests that the multiple xanthomas observed in CTX may be induced by increased oxidized LDL and the low activity of CETP, both of which are caused by a lack of CDCA.",M1
15147532,"Coronary heart disease in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Coronary heart disease is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of death in developed countries. Most cases are due to the cluster of classical risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia. However, a few patients develop severe and premature arteriosclerosis in spite of absence of common risk factors. Here, we present the clinical, analytical and molecular features of a 36-years-old man who died from advanced ischaemic heart disease as a result of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), a rare condition characterized by elevation in plasma and most tissues of cholestanol and where neurological impairment is the hallmark of this disease. We discuss the relevance of heart disease and the mechanism leading to accelerate arteriosclerosis is CTX.",M1
15131757,"Hydrophilic 7 beta-hydroxy bile acids, lovastatin, and cholestyramine are ineffective in the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.We compared the effect of treatments with hydrophilic bile acids (ursodeoxycholic and ursocholic acids), cholestyramine, and lovastatin versus chenodeoxycholic acid in 4 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>). Bile acids and bile alcohols in plasma, bile, and urine before and after treatment were quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography. Untreated, all patients showed abnormal biliary bile acid composition: cholic acid (72.7%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (6.2%), and polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols (10.0%), and elevated plasma cholestanol levels. Treatment with hydrophobic chenodeoxycholic acid inhibited abnormal bile acid synthesis (virtual disappearance of C(27)-bile alcohols from plasma, bile, and urine and marked reduction of plasma cholestanol levels). Hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic and ursocholic acids did not inhibit abnormal bile acid synthesis, while cholestyramine increased abnormal bile acid synthesis (continued increased formation of polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols and further elevation of plasma cholestanol levels). Lovastatin did not affect abnormal bile acid synthesis or reduce plasma cholestanol levels. The results demonstrate that impaired side-chain oxidation in bile acid synthesis due to mutations of Cyp27 results in increased formation of polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols and cholestanol in CTX. Hydrophobic chenodeoxycholic acid, but not cholestyramine, lovastatin, or hydrophilic 7beta-hydroxy acids, inhibited the abnormal synthetic pathway. The role of chenodeoxycholic acid in downregulating abnormal bile acid synthesis in CTX is emphasized.",M1
15061585,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical course, genotypes and metabolic backgrounds.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease. It has been reported in more than 200 people worldwide. This review covers the epidemiologic, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the disease, its clinical symptoms and treatment. A search of MEDLINE, using the keywords cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, brain xanthoma, tendon xanthoma, cholestanol, cholesterol and bile alcohol for articles covering clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, pathology, molecular defects and treatment of CTX, revealed 175 patients with documented CTX. Of these patients, 56% were female. The incidence of tendon xanthomas was 71%, cataracts 92%, low intelligence 81% and other neurologic symptoms 100%. Several genetic studies have revealed mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene, resulting in markedly diminished activity of the enzyme in CTX patients. This genetic defect is associated with elevated plasma cholestanol levels and consequently its accumulation in the brain, lens, tendons and other tissues. The disease can be treated by the administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, a cost-effective therapy that will considerably reduce the socioeconomic burden of treating patients with CTX. The mechanism of cholestanol accumulation in affected tissues and its pathogenesis are undefined and therefore warrant further investigation.",M1

We present and discuss the clinical, radiological and histopathologic findings in 2 siblings with CTX. Both the patients had juvenile cataract, mental retardation and marked cerebellar ataxia. The Achilles tendon swelling was present in only 1 patient (Case 2). MR imaging showed typical bilateral and symmetrical involvement of the dentate nuclei, inferior olives, brainstem and cerebellar hemispheric white matter. Although the diagnosis of CTX was made in the 3rd decade in both our cases, early diagnosis is possible if neuroimaging is done in the early course of the disease.",M1
14585188,"Cholestanol metabolism, molecular pathology, and nutritional implications.Cholestanol, not cholesterol, is a minor component in the human body and in foods, but an increase in cholestanol concentration in serum induces a pathological condition named cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>). In our investigation of this disease for more than 25 years, a procedure for quantification of cholestanol by high-performance liquid chromatography and an assay method for sterol 27-hydroxylase were established, and several mutations of the CYP 27 gene in 10 CTX families were identified. We also established experimental animal models with symptoms of CTX by feeding a high cholestanol diet. Corneal dystrophy and gallstones were produced in mice, and an apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells was observed in rats. We propose the following underlying mechanism of CTX pathogenesis: When cholesterol in the plasma membrane is replaced by cholestanol to some extent, the membrane fluidity is reduced, and the calcium channel fails to open, inducing cell death. CTX patients are treated with oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, which reduces the cholestanol concentration in serum. Cholestanol has a toxic effect, and an imbalance of the cholesterol/cholestanol ratio in plasma membrane is suspected to cause the disturbance of calcium channel function of the membrane.",M1

A case of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in a 57-year-old Japanese man with CTX, confirmed clinically, biochemically and at autopsy is reported together with analyses of the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) and p53 genes. A missense mutation of the p53 (G for C) was detected in the gallbladder adenocarcinoma. Direct sequence analysis also showed a silent mutational substitution of unknown significance, C for A, in CYP27 at codon 89. In the past, CTX patients have only demonstrated this infrequently, indicating no direct relationship between CYP27 dysfunction and tumour development. Thus, the present case of gallbladder cancer appears to be a chance occurrence.",M1
12637303,"Quantification of brain damage in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with magnetization transfer MR imaging.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging for quantification of brain damage in monitoring the evolution of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) has limitations. Magnetization transfer (MT) MR imaging is overcoming these limitations. Using MT MR imaging, we sought to quantify, in vivo, the extent of brain and cerebellar damage in patients with CTX, with the ulimate goal to investigate the magnitude of the correlation between MT MR imaging findings and clinical disability. METHODS: Conventional and MT MR images of the brain were obtained in nine patients with CTX and in 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. MT ratio histograms were derived of the whole brain, brain normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), brain normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM), cerebellar NAWM, and cerebellar NAGM. Clinical disability was measured by using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). RESULTS: Average MT ratio and peak heights of the whole brain, brain NAWM, and brain NAGM histograms in patients with CTX were significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the control subjects. All cerebellar NAGM MT ratio histogram-derived metrics and average MT ratio of the cerebellar NAWM histogram in patients with CTX were also significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the control subjects. Strong correlations were found between the EDSS score and a composite whole-brain MT ratio histogram score (r = 0.77, P &lt;.01) and a composite brain white matter MT ratio histogram score (r = 0.71, P &lt;.03). A strong correlation was also found between the cerebellar functional system score and a composite cerebellar NAWM score (r = 0.72, P &lt;.02). CONCLUSION: The quantitative assessment of brain damage in patients with CTX with use of MT MR imaging can provide powerful measures of disease outcome.",M1
12555943,"Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) cause hepatitis of infancy as well as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Follow-up investigations were undertaken on a previously reported patient who had severe familial giant cell hepatitis in infancy associated with substantially increased urinary excretion of bile alcohol glucuronides. By the age of 11 years, he had developed a profile of cholanoids in plasma and urine that closely resembled the pattern seen in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>). Sequencing of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) showed that he was homozygous for a deletion (525/526delG) that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. This genotype has previously been described in an adult female with classical symptoms of CTX (tendon xanthomata, cataracts and deteriorating cognitive function). A review of past medical histories of a group of patients with CTX revealed that prolonged neonatal cholestatic jaundice was common. The family histories also revealed fetal and neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX. We conclude that defective activity of cholesterol 27-hydroxylase can lead to neonatal cholestatic jaundice ('hepatitis of infancy'), which may be self-limiting. After a latent period, however, progressive accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol can lead to the xanthomata, neurodegeneration, cataracts and atherosclerosis that are typical of CTX.",M1
12487962,"[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendinous xanthomas: presentation of two cases]Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a genetic disorder caused by a 27-hydroxilase enzyme deficiency, leading to beta-cholestanol storage in many body tissues. Clinically, the disease is characterised by the presence of tendinous xanthomas, juvenile cataracts and progressive neurologic dysfunction. The diagnosis requires beta-cholestanol quantification in serum. We report two siblings with a history of photosensitive epilepsy of childhood onset, who developed progressive spastic paraparesis and cataracts in their third decade of life. They were diagnosed to have CTX in spite of the absence of tendinous xanthomas. Cranial and spinal MRI only showed bilateral high intensity signal in the dentate nuclei in the T2-weighted and proton-density sequences. Our patients presented with a progressive spastic paraparesis. The delay in the diagnosis in our case could be due to the absence of tendinous xanthomas and late-onset cataracts. The recognition of the disease is important, because the treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid induces a decrement of beta-cholestanol levels in serum and could prevent the progression of the disease.",M1
12486565,"[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a treatable metabolic disorder]Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis which can be clinically diagnosed and specifically treated. It is an underdiagnosed disorder worldwide.Here,we describe two women who were diagnosed with CTX during their forties after symptoms had already developed 15 years earlier. Both patients showed gait ataxia, spastic paraparesis, polyneuropathy, bilateral premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and cognitive deficits. One of the patients had also chronic diarrhea. The deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase results in a virtual absence of chenodeoxycholic acid. This leads to excessive production of cholestanol and cholesterol and accumulation of these sterols in many tissues, especially the eye lens, central nervous system,and tendons. The determination of a high cholestanol serum level allows the diagnosis,which can be confirmed through genetic analysis. Early diagnosis of CTX is important, since an effective therapy is available. Long-term therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid is effective for CTX, mainly in prevention of further deterioration.",M1
12270007,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: molecular characterization of two Scandinavian sisters.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a hereditary disorder, which is inherited as an autosomally recessive disease, causing production of cholesterol and cholestanol xanthomas and mental retardation. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene for sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). The only CTX patients diagnosed in Scandinavia are two Norwegian sisters from a consanguineous marriage. Here we have characterized the mutation and its functional consequences for the enzyme. Analysis of genomic DNA from cultured fibroblasts identified a base exchange C &gt; T in position 1441, causing arginine at amino acid position 441 to be replaced by tryptophan. The same mutation was introduced by mutagenesis in the complimentary DNA (cDNA) for CYP27, ligated into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax and transfected into HEK293 cells. The mutated enzyme had less than 5% of the enzyme activity compared with the native enzyme. No abnormal catalytic products could be identified in the cell culture medium. Probably the mutation affects the haem binding within the holoenzyme. The mutation has also previously been reported in a Japanese family. This is the second example of a CTX-causing mutation that has been recognized in more than one population.",M1

Clinically, CTX is characterized by tendon xanthomas, cataracts and progressive neurological deficits. Because of the disruption of the 27-hydroxylase activity, CTX patients have elevated plasma levels of cholestanol, a by-product of abnormal bile acid synthesis. The present authors describe a female patient with CTX. The proband in this study presented with elevated cholestanol levels, markedly reduced mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activity and altered bile acid composition. The 27-hydroxylase gene was analysed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the exons and the splice-junction regions of the gene. The proband was found to be a compound heterozygote for two different mutations which have not been previously described: (1) a G --&gt; A transition at nucleotide 455 that is responsible for converting a glycine to a glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 112 (G112E); and (2) a five-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 (from nucleotide 965 to 969) that is responsible for a shift in the reading frame and the insertion of a premature codon at position 296, and consequently, the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the heme-binding and andrenodoxin-binding domains.

To gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients.

Endocrine Metab., 84, 4111-4117]. None of the CYP27B1 mutants showed 1alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, it was assumed that the mutated amino-acid residues play important roles in the 1alpha-hydroxylase activity, such as substrate binding, activation of molecular oxygen, interaction with adrenodoxin, and folding of the cytochrome P450 structure. To examine our hypothesis, we generated various mutants of CYP27B1 and studied their enzymatic properties. In addition, the corresponding mutations were introduced to CYP27A1, which belongs to the same family as CYP27B1. As CYP27A1 showed much higher expression level than CYP27B1 in Escherichia coli, further analysis including heme-binding and substrate-binding was performed with CYP27A1 in place of CYP27B1. Western blot analysis, spectral analysis including reduced CO-difference spectra and substrate-induced difference spectra, and enzymatic analysis of the mutant CYP27A1 gave information on the structure-function relationships of both CYP27A1 and CYP27B1. Although the sequence alignment suggested that Arg107, Gly125, and Pro497 of CYP27B1 might be involved in substrate binding, the experimental data strongly suggested that mutations of these amino-acid residues destroyed the tertiary structure of the substrate-heme pocket. It was also suggested that Arg389 and Arg453 of CYP27B1 were involved in heme-propionate binding, and Asp164 stabilized the four-helix bundle consisting of D, E, I and J helices, possibly by forming a salt bridge. Thr321 was found to be responsible for the activation of molecular oxygen.",M1

CTX is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disease. The clinical hallmarks are: bilateral juvenile cataract, chronic diarrhoea, progressive neurological symptoms and signs, and tendon xanthomas.

11454857,"Side chain hydroxylations in bile acid biosynthesis catalyzed by CYP3A are markedly up-regulated in Cyp27-/- mice but not in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.The accumulation of various 25-hydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols in blood and their excretion in urine are characteristic features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) a recessively inherited inborn error of bile acid synthesis caused by mutations in the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene. These bile alcohols may be intermediates in the alternative cholic acid side chain cleavage pathway. The present study was undertaken to identify enzymes and reactions responsible for the formation of these bile alcohols and to explain why Cyp27(-/-) mice do not show CTX-related abnormalities. Microsomal activities of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 25- and 26-hydroxylases, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol 23R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylases and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase, a marker enzyme for CYP3A, in Cyp27(-/-) mice livers were markedly up-regulated (5.5-, 3.5-, 6.5-, 7.5-, 2.9-, and 5.4-fold, respectively). In contrast, these enzyme activities were not increased in CTX. The activities of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 25- and 26-hydroxylases and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylases were strongly correlated with the activities of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase in control human liver microsomes from eight unrelated donors. Troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A, markedly suppressed these microsomal side chain hydroxylations in both mouse and human livers in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, experiments using recombinant overexpressed human CYP3A4 confirmed that these microsomal side chain hydroxylations were catalyzed by a single enzyme, CYP3A4. The results demonstrate that microsomal 25- and 26-hydroxylations of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol and microsomal 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylations of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol are mainly catalyzed by CYP3A in both mice and humans.

We describe the clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management of the first reported Australasian case of CTX. Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of CTX and demonstrated that the patient was homozygous for a G--&gt;A transition in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene. Serum cholestanol concentrations were decreased with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin alone and greater reductions were achieved after the addition of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid; suggesting a synergistic effect of this combination. Despite serum cholestanol concentrations remaining within the low-normal range, there has been no significant improvement in mental and physical abilities or in EEG abnormalities with 5 years of treatment. Metabolism of radiolabeled 7-ketocholesterol to aqueous soluble products was absent in CTX-derived macrophages.

Patients with this disease are known to have mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27) gene. However, one study showed that mice with a disrupted Cyp27 gene did not have any CTX-related clinical or biochemical abnormalities. To explore the reason, hepatic cholesterol, cholestanol, and 12 intermediates in bile acid biosynthetic pathways were quantified in 10 Cyp27(-/-) and 7 Cyp27(+/+) mice, two CTX patients (untreated and treated with chenodeoxycholic acid), and four human control subjects by high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mitochondrial 27-hydroxycholesterol and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,27-tetrol were virtually absent in both Cyp27(-/-) mice and CTX patients. In Cyp27(-/-) mice, microsomal concentrations of intermediates in the early bile acid biosynthetic pathway (7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol), 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols (5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,23R,25-pentol, and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24R, 25-pentol), and cholestanol were all significantly elevated compared with those in Cyp27(+/+) mice, although the levels were lower than those in untreated CTX patients. The intermediate levels in early bile acid biosynthesis were more elevated in male (16;-86% of CTX) than in female Cyp27(-/-) mice (7-30% of CTX). In contrast, 25-hydroxylated bile alcohol concentrations were not significantly different between male and female Cyp27(-/-) mice and were considerably lower (less than 14%) than those in CTX patients.These results suggest that 1) in Cyp27(-/-) mice, especially in females, classic bile acid biosynthesis via 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol is not stimulated as much as in CTX patients; and 2) formed 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols are more efficiently metabolized in Cyp27(-/-) mice than in CTX patients.",M1

Clinically, CTX patients present with tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts, and progressive neurological dysfunction and can be diagnosed by the detection of elevated plasma cholestanol levels. CTX is caused by mutations affecting the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27 ). CTX has been identified in a number of populations, but seems to have a higher prevalence in the Japanese, Sephardic Jewish, and Italian populations. We have assembled 12 previously unreported pedigrees from the United States. The CYP27 locus had been previously mapped to chromosome 2q33-qter. We performed linkage analyses and found no evidence of genetic heterogeneity. All CTX patients showed segregation with the CYP27 locus, and haplotype analysis and recombinant events allowed us to precisely map CYP27 to chromosome 2q35, between markers D2S1371 and D2S424. Twenty-three mutations were identified from 13 probands analyzed thus far; 11 were compound heterozygotes and 2 had homozygous mutations. Of these, five are novel mutations [Trp100Stop, Pro408Ser, Gln428Stop, a 10-base pair (bp) deletion in exon 1, and a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the CYP27 gene]. Three-dimensional structural modeling of sterol 27-hydroxylase showed that, while the majority of the missense mutations disrupt the heme-binding and adrenodoxin-binding domains critical for enzyme activity, two missense mutations (Arg94Trp/Gln and Lys226Arg) are clearly located outside these sites and may identify a potential substrate-binding or other protein contact site.",M1

Besides typical CTX symptoms, all three patients showed severe parkinsonism. This observation has been rarely reported in CTX. The fact that the two siblings showed parkinsonism strongly suggests the genetic propensity to parkinsonism in these CTX patients. Positron emission tomography studies of the two patients revealed presynaptic dysfunction of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. Treatment with the reductase inhibitor hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme successfully corrected the serum cholestanol level in the early stage of the disease, which, however, did not arrest the progression of clinical symptoms, particularly their parkinsonism. Clinically, levodopa had a little effect on parkinsonism, whereas an antihistamine drug, diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPP) had excellent effects on all three patients throughout the long-term follow up. The mechanism of the action of DPP on parkinsonism is unclear, however, the drug seems to be a therapeutic choice for treating parkinsonism in CTX.",M1
11133792,"Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic changes in brains of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a rare disorder due to an inherited defect in the metabolic pathway of cholesterol. Early diagnosis of the disease is particularly important as patients benefit from therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid. Although the disease is clinically characterized by the concomitant presence of tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts and progressive neurological impairment, clinical features may vary greatly. Neuroradiological studies have suggested that the bilateral abnormality of the dentate nuclei could be typical of this disease. However, this finding has been seen inconsistently on conventional MRI. The dynamic of the CNS pathology in CTX is complex, and whether demyelination or axonopathy has primary importance in the pathogenesis of CTX pathology is not known. To clarify both neuroradiological and pathological issues, we performed combined brain MRI and spectroscopy examinations on 12 CTX patients. On conventional MRIs, bilateral hyperintensities of the dentate nuclei were clearly seen in nine out of 12 patients on T(2) -weighted MRIs, but were evident in all patients using a FLAIR sequence. On proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, significant decreases in N: -acetylaspartate resonance intensities (P: &lt;0.0001) and increases in lactate MR signals (P&lt;0.05) were found in the group of CTX patients in large volumes of interest localized above the lateral brain ventricles and in the cerebellar hemispheres. Cerebral values of N -acetylaspartate resonance intensities showed a close correlation with patients' disability (Spearman rank correlation = -0.78, P&lt;0.005). These results suggest that MR abnormalities in the dentate nuclei may be evident consistently in patients with CTX. Proton MR spectroscopy data demonstrated widespread axonal damage (as shown by the decrease in N -acetylaspartate) and diffuse brain mitochondrial dysfunction (as shown by the increase in brain parenchymal lactate) in patients with CTX. The close correlation seen between values of the putative axonal marker N-acetylaspartate and patients' disability scores suggests that proton MR spectroscopy can provide a useful measure of disease outcome in CTX.",M1

RESULTS: Apart from nonspecific supratentorial atrophy and deep white matter changes, more typical hyperintense lesions were seen on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus (in 79% of patients), globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and inferior olive and extended into adjacent white matter as disease progressed. In these locations, lipid crystal clefts and perivascular macrophages, neuronal loss, demyelination, fibrosis, and reactive astrocytosis were found at microscopic examination. Hypointensity was sometimes found on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus and was related to deposition of hemosiderin and calcifications. CT depicted fewer lesions; all had low attenuation, except for the calcifications. Spinal cord MR imaging revealed increased signal intensity in the lateral and dorsal columns on T2-weighted images. Achilles tendon xanthomas displayed intermediate signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. CONCLUSION: The typical pattern of MR imaging findings reflects the classic histopathologic findings and should prompt the diagnosis of CTX.",M1
10901139,"A new method for determination of serum cholestanol by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection.We developed a method for the determination of serum 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol (cholestanol). The sterols were derivatized to the 4'-bromobenzenesulfonyl esters and heated in isopropanol. The cholesterol-4'-bromobenzenesulfonate was solvolyzed to cholesteryl isopropyl ether, but the derivatized cholestanol did not change and could be measured in a high-performance liquid chromatographic system equipped with a UV detector at 235 nm. On the other hand, the resulting cholesteryl isopropyl ether, having different absorbance and chromatographic mobility was not detected. This method was used for measuring cholestanol levels in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), liver cirrhosis and serum from healthy control subjects. Reproducibility, linearity and recovery tests were done on 0.3 ml of serum samples containing &gt;2 microg/ml cholestanol, using stigmastanol as an internal standard (I.S.). Determining cholestenol by this method can be used for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CTX and various liver diseases.",M1
10885331,"[A case of familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia with the clinical features similar to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis]A 63-years-old woman noticed unsteady gait at the age of 56 years and then developed dysarthria two years later. A general physical examination at age 56 revealed mild hypertrophy of both Achilles tendons. On neurological examination, she had scanning speech, moderate limb and truncal ataxia, and moderate hyperreflexia of all limbs. A soft tissue X-ray examination disclosed hypertrophy of both Achilles tendons with multiple punctate calcification. Brain MRI showed diffuse cerebellar atrophy. Motor evoked potentials in the right limb disclosed a prolonged central conduction time. Blood chemistry showed familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia (cholesterol 320 mg/dl, and LDL-cholesterol 245 mg/dl), yet cholestanol level was normal. A examination of <e>CTX</e> gene mutation at hot spots revealed no mutation. Her mother and two siblings also had hypertrophy of Achilles tendons as well as type IIa hypercholesterolemia. In addition, the one sibling showed mild ataxia of lower limbs, respectively. This report suggests a possible link between familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia and cerebellar degeneration syndrome clinically mimicking CTX.",M1
10869358,"Sterol 27-hydroxylase acts on 7-ketocholesterol in human atherosclerotic lesions and macrophages in culture.27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OH) is the major oxysterol in human atherosclerotic lesions, followed by 7-ketocholesterol (7K). Whereas 7K probably originates nonenzymically, 27OH arises by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme expressed at particularly high levels in the macrophage and proposed to represent an important pathway by which macrophages eliminate excess cholesterol. We hypothesized and here show that 27-hydroxylated 7-ketocholesterol (270H-7K) is present in human lesions, probably generated by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase on 7K. Moreover, [(3)H]27OH-7K was produced by human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) supplied with [(3)H]7K but not in HMDMs from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) shown to have a splice-junction mutation of sterol 27-hydroxylase. Whereas [(3)H]27OH-7K was predominantly secreted into the medium, [(3)H]-27OH formed from [(3)H]-cholesterol was mostly cell-associated. The majority of supplied [(3)H]7K was metabolized beyond 27OH-7K to aqueous-soluble products (apparently bile acids derived from the sterol 27-hydroxylase pathway). Metabolism to aqueous-soluble products was ablated by a sterol 27-hydroxylase inhibitor and absent in CTX cells. Sterol 27-hydroxylase therefore appears to represent an important pathway by which macrophages eliminate not only cholesterol but also oxysterols such as 7K. The fact that 7K (and cholesterol) still accumulates in lesions and foam cells indicates that this pathway may be perturbed in atherosclerosis and affords a new opportunity for the development of therapeutic strategies to regress atherosclerotic lesions.",M1
10775536,"Clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a lipid storage disease caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP 27), due to mutations in its gene. In this study we report on mutations in 58 patients with CTX out of 32 unrelated families. Eight of these were novel mutations, two of which were found together with two already known pathogenic mutations. Twelve mutations found in this patient group have been described in the literature. In the patients from 31 families, mutations were found in both alleles. In the literature, 28 mutations in 67 patients with CTX out of 44 families have been described. Pooling our patient group and the patients from the literature together, 37 different mutations in 125 patients out of 74 families were obtained. Identical mutations have been found in families from different ethnic backgrounds. In 41% of all the patients, CYP 27 gene mutations are found in the region of exons 6-8. This region encodes for adrenodoxin and haem binding sites of the protein. Of these 125 patients, a genotype-phenotype analysis was done for 79 homozygous patients harbouring 23 different mutations, out of 45 families. The patients with compound heterozygous mutations were left out of the genotype-phenotype analysis. The genotype-phenotype analysis did not reveal any correlation.",M1
10768627,"Presence of diarrhea and absence of tendon xanthomas in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis. A diagnosis of CTX should be considered in patients with premature bilateral cataracts, intractable diarrhea, neurological signs and symptoms, and tendon xanthomas, especially in the Achilles tendons. The prevalence of these signs and symptoms increases with age. OBJECTIVES: To investigate signs and symptoms, age at onset, and age at diagnosis in 32 patients with biochemically and genetically confirmed CTX, and to compare this clinical spectrum with reports in the literature. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of records of all patients with CTX at our hospital (27 adults and 5 children). After a MEDLINE search in the English, French, and German literature, 181 patients with CTX (165 adults and 16 children) were identified worldwide. RESULTS: Of our 32 patients with CTX, 31 (97%) had cataracts and neurological signs and symptoms, predominantly pyramidal signs (26 [81%]); 21 (66%) had low intelligence and 18 (56%) had cerebellar signs. Only 13 (41%) had visible or palpable tendon xanthomas at the time of diagnosis. In total, 16 patients (50%) had chronic, intractable diarrhea that started in childhood. These findings were in contrast with the literature, where tendon xanthomas were reported in 89% and diarrhea in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that CTX is underdiagnosed worldwide. We recommend that the presence of 2 of the 4 clinical hallmarks of CTX prompt thorough metabolic screening, including determination of urine bile alcohol excretion and serum cholestanol level, because CTX is a treatable disease.",M1
10741487,"Sudden death due to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis confirmed by mutation analysis.A case of sudden death of a 52-year-old mentally retarded Caucasian male is described where the rectal temperature was 43.4 degrees C 3 h postmortem. The autopsy revealed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), a rare hereditary metabolic disorder, as the primary disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem identification of two mutations (compound heterozygosity for R237X and IVS6+1G--&gt;A) in the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene. Both mutations have already been described in patients with CTX and can be considered the most likely cause of the disease. The pathomechanism of the excessive hyperthermia could not be completely elucidated.",M1
10519880,"Mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) results in truncation of mRNA expressed in leucocytes in a Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.OBJECTIVES: A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts, prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique. METHODS: An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and subsequent sequencing. Samples of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the product of the proband was amplified with nested primers and sequenced. RESULTS: A homozygous G to A transition at the 5' end of intron 7 was detected in the patient. In RT-PCR analysis, only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient, whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings. The sequencing of the patient's cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8. CONCLUSION: The mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mRNA were identical with those of a recently reported Italian patient, although different in symptomatology. The application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique on analysing a constructive abnormality of CYP27 mRNA.",M1

MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Post-mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. An array of genotypes was found in these patients.

10406988,"Mutations producing premature termination of translation and an amino acid substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis associated with parkinsonism.OBJECTIVES: Mutational analysis of the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene was performed on three patients from two Japanese families who had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) associated with parkinsonism. METHODS: Clinical evaluations, brain MRI studies, and laboratory analyses were completed on the three patients. The CYP27 gene was analysed for mutations by PCR amplification of gene segments followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Two different, homozygous mutations were identified in these families. One is a novel transition, substituting T for G at Glu162 (GAG) resulting in a stop codon (TAG). The other is also a transition, substituting T for C at Arg441 (CGG) resulting in Trp (TGG). The second is located in two amino acids ahead of the heme ligand binding site (Cys443) of the protein likely rendering it non-functional. It is the most common CTX mutation in Japanese patients. CONCLUSIONS: CTX with parkinsonism is caused by mutations with a severe impact on enzyme function. The two mutations described here are likely to cause loss of function because they are chain terminating or affect an essential site in the protein.",M1
10066446,"Cholestanol induces apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is a hereditary lipid storage disease characterized by hyper-cholestanolemia, cerebellar ataxia, xanthoma, and cataract. We hypothesized that cholestanol in serum of CTX patients might induce neuronal cell death in the cerebellum and eventually lead to cerebellar ataxia. To gain support for this hypothesis we developed hyper-cholestanolemia rats by feeding cholestanol. Neuronal cells, especially Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were stained by Sudan black B only in the cholestanol-fed rats, indicating the deposit of cholestanol in cerebellum. To examine effects of cholestanol in vitro, cerebellar neuronal cells were cultured with cholestanol. The cholestanol concentration increased and the viability decreased in cells cultured with cholestanol. Apoptosis was evident in cells cultured with cholestanol more frequently than in control cells, determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method. As activities of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and CPP32 protease were increased in cells cultured with cholestanol, all these data taken together suggest that cholestanol induced apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells. Our observations may explain the mechanism of cerebellar ataxia of CTX patients.",M1
10024088,"Effect of simvastatin in addition to chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.The effects of combination therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin on serum cholestanol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and lathosterol levels were investigated in seven adult patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) who were on long-term treatment with CDCA. The patients were treated with a combination of CDCA 750 mg daily and an increasing dose of simvastatin from 10 mg to 40 mg daily for a period of 6 months. We found a significant effect of this combination therapy compared with CDCA alone in terms of decreasing the serum cholestanol and LDL cholesterol levels, particularly with a daily dose of 40 mg simvastatin. The mean cholestanol level decreased from 9.27 micromol/L (baseline) to 6.69 micromol/L (40 mg simvastatin), while the mean LDL cholesterol level decreased from 5.08 mmol/L (baseline) to 3.04 mmol/L (40 mg simvastatin). No side effects were reported, and there were no effects on the clinical condition, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked potentials, and electroencephalographic features. We conclude that a combination of 750 mg CDCA and 40 mg simvastatin daily is effective to further reduce serum cholestanol, LDL cholesterol, and lathosterol in adult CTX patients treated with long-term CDCA. Whether this combination treatment will be effective for the long-term prevention of neurological deterioration and atherosclerosis remains to be established.",M1
9868952,"Pulmonary manifestations in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.We investigated five cases with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) with particular reference to biochemical and pathological pulmonary disorders. To date, few reports discuss the pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders of CTX patients. This study is the first investigation of such pulmonary disorders. All 5 patients had no pulmonary symptoms and no disturbances on radiological studies and pulmonary function tests. However, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, many cells with cruciform reflexes, which is characteristic of intracellular sterol accumulation, were found under phase contrast microscopy. Biochemically, cholestanol was found to be increased in the BAL fluid as well as in serum. Pathological findings of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) samples disclosed foamy macrophages and small granulomas in alveolar septa. In conclusion, the lung was apparently involved in CTX, and the lesions were characterized with the accumulation of foamy and giant cells with a high concentration of cholestanol, which likely results in the formation of foreign body granulomas.",M1
9808240,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum.Premature atherosclerosis and cardiac complications have been reported among the systemic manifestations of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), a rare bile acid disorder with predominantly neurological features. In some cases, myocardial infarction has been the cause of sudden death. We examined nine CTX patients to determine whether they also had clinical or subclinical signs of cardiovascular disorders. In four of them, transthoracic echocardiography showed thickening of the interatrial septum compatible with lipomatous hypertrophy. The unexpected association of the two abnormalities is unlikely to be coincidental and suggests that careful cardiac examination should be considered, even in the absence of clinical manifestations.",M1
9790667,"A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27): its effects on pre-mRNA splicing and enzyme activity.A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>). The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362Arg to 362Ser (CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of mutant cDNA into COS-1 cells. Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52.5% of the normal level. As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5' splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3' end of exon 6. Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding effects on pre-mRNA splicing of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5' splice site.",M1

Its deficiency causes the autosomal recessive disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), characterized by progressive dementia, xanthomatosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Mice with a disrupted cyp27 (cyp27(-/-)) had normal plasma levels of cholesterol, retinol, tocopherol, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Excretion of fecal bile acids was decreased (&lt;20% of normal), and formation of bile acids from tritium-labeled 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol was less than 15% of normal. Compensatory up-regulation of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (9- and 2-3-fold increases in mRNA levels, respectively) was found. No CTX-related pathological abnormalities were observed. In CTX, there is an increased formation of 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols and cholestanol. In bile and feces of the cyp27(-/-) mice only traces of bile alcohols were found, and there was no cholestanol accumulation. It is evident that sterol 27-hydroxylase is more important for bile acid synthesis in mice than in humans. The results do not support the contention that 27-hydroxylated steroids are critical for maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis or levels of vitamin D metabolites in the circulation.",M1

In all children biochemical, neuroradiological, and neurophysiological studies were done. CTX was diagnosed and effects of therapy were evaluated by determination of the serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (CCR) and the urinary excretion of bile alcohols. All children were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg/day) in three divided oral doses. Diarrhoea and juvenile cataract were the main clinical features. Psychomotor retardation, pyramidal and cerebellar signs were also found. After starting treatment, biochemical abnormalities normalized and diarrhoea disappeared. After 1 year of therapy there was no further delay in motor development, and in three children the intelligence quotient improved. EEG abnormalities disappeared. After 5 years of therapy the children are in a stable clinical condition. CONCLUSION: The clinical, biochemical and neurophysiological abnormalities in five children with CTX showed a remarkable improvement after starting treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.

9521761,"Silent nucleotide substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site at the mutant codon in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients.A functionally silent nucleotide substitution of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27), identified in two families with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), was confirmed to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. Full-length RT-PCR analysis of the CYP 27 gene in a patient from one of the CTX families revealed one major and an additional faint band. Sequence analysis of the cloned RT-PCR product showed three species of cDNA: 3' terminal 13 bp of exon 2 deleted cDNA, exon 2 skipped cDNA, and full-length cDNA with a functionally silent G to T mutation at codon 112 (GGG 112Gly to GGT 112Gly). Only a single base change was identified by genomic DNA sequence analysis of the CYP 27 gene in the patient: T replaced G at the third position of codon 112, 13 bp upstream from the 3' terminus of exon 2. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, confirmed that this silent mutation resulted in alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site around the mutant codon. The mutation was also identified in two patients from another CTX family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at codon 372, a mutation reported previously by our group. The results elucidate a novel molecular basis for the CTX and suggest the significance of a silent nucleotide substitution with regard to pre-RNA splicing.",M1
9548584,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) caused by a G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>).A recently identified G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was shown here to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. Northern blot analysis of the patient's RNA revealed a broadened band in the human CYP 27 mRNA region compared to that of the normal sample, indicating that there may exist differently spliced mRNA species in the patient. RT-PCR produced three fragments in the patient, one was full-length size and the other two were of smaller sizes. Sequence analysis confirmed that the nucleotide of the full-length size was identical to that of the normal full-length cDNA, except for the G to A mutation at codon 362, which corresponds to the last nucleotide of exon 6. One of the smaller size species lacked exon 6 and the other was absent from the 3' terminal 88 bp of exon 6 due to the use of an activated cryptic 5' splice site in exon 6. The correctly spliced mRNA harbouring the G to A mutation was responsible for the deficiency of the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by transfection experiment. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, showed that correctly spliced mRNA was observed in the normal minigene while the mutant minigene was differently spliced. This is the first report of a G to A substitution at the last nucleotide of an exon resulting in both normal and abnormal pre-mRNA splicings, including exon skipping and activating of a coding region cryptic 5' splice site. The results reveal a new molecular basis for the CTX and provide information on aberrant splicing of pre-mRNA in multi-exon genes.",M1

Three Japanese CTX patients from two unrelated families were studied genetically. By DNA sequence analysis a novel mutation of A for G substitution at amino acid position 372 (CGG 372Arg to CAG 372Gln) was identified in one of the CTX families. The mutation was also found in two patients from the other family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at amino acid position 441 (CGG 441Arg to CAG 441Gln). The latter mutation was the same as previously reported by our group (J. Lipid Res. 1994. 35: 1031-1039). As the two mutations changed the restriction enzyme sites, rapid screening methods were developed for the detection of the carriers. Transfection of the two mutant cDNAs into COS cells resulted in markedly reduced sterol 27-hydroxylase activity. These results indicate that the two mutations are responsible for the deficiency of the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in these patients. The features of mutations identified till now in Japanese CTX patients are also reviewed.",M1

The reaction sequence involved treating the intermediate, alpha-diazoketone in methanol with 3% AgNO3 or Ag2O, anhydrous Na2CO3, Na2S2O/H2O resulting in the formation of homoursocholic acid in high yield. Esterification of the homoursocholic acid in methanol containing a catalytic amount of methanesulfonic acid under microwave irradiation conditions gave methyl homourscholate. The subsequent treatment of methyl homoursocholate with methyl magnesium iodide provided 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol in 88% yield. The products and synthetic intermediates prepared in these studies were fully characterized by the results of 1D and 2D NMR, and high-resolution mass spectral studies.

One patient was a 36-year-old woman with a 7-month history of dizziness and unsteadiness following surgical resection of a recurrent pilocystic astrocytoma located in the cerebellar vermis. The other patient was a 48-year-old man with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) and diffuse cerebellar atrophy, and a 10-year history of progressive gait and balance difficulties. Each patient was treated with a 6-week course of physical therapy that emphasized the practice of activities that challenged stability. The patient with the cerebellar tumor resection also performed eye-head coordination exercises. Each patient had weekly therapy and performed selected balance retraining exercises on a daily basis at home. Measurements taken before and after treatment for each patient included self-perception of symptoms, clinical balance tests, and stability during selected standing and gait activities; for the patient with the cerebellar tumor resection, vestibular function tests and posturography were also performed. Both patients reported improvements in symptoms and demonstrated similar improvements on several kinematic indicators of stability during gait. The patient with the cerebellar tumor resection improved on posturography following treatment, whereas the patient with CTX improved on clinical balance tests. This case report describes two individualized treatment programs and documents functional improvements in two patients with different etiologies, durations, and clinical presentations of cerebellar dysfunction. The outcomes suggest that patients with cerebellar lesions, acute or chronic, may be able to learn to improve their postural stability.",M1

The evaluation was based on the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) before and after 3 years of combined therapy. Clinically, the therapeutic effect was quite limited (almost no change in BMD values), and did not parallel the marked decrease in serum cholestanol level (normalization of serum levels). While the reason for the therapeutic failure in our patients is not known, it is possible that delay in starting treatment may have been a factor. Measurement of BMD for evaluation of therapeutic effect in long-standing osteoporosis in CTX patients is of little practical value.",M1

The disease is associated with mutations in CYP27, which encodes mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of sterol intermediates during bile acid synthesis. The loss of this enzyme results in accumulation of cholestanol in the nervous system and other tissues. Six different mutations have been previously described in CTX. We analyzed a Pakistani family, which included four affected individuals with clinical characteristics of CTX, for mutations in CYP27. The exons of CYP27 in the family DNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed for mutations by band shifts (single stranded conformational polymorphism [SSCP]) and DNA sequencing. The PCR product for exon 4 showed an SSCP change in this family. The DNA of affected individuals showed an abnormal mobility pattern interpreted as homozygous for the mutation. One non-affected sibling was homozygous for the normal migrating pattern, whereas the parents and another non-affected sibling were heterozygous. The sequence of exon 4 of affected individuals showed a substitution of C to T in codon 237, thus substituting arginine to a stop codon. This mutation would terminate the translation, which may result in a protein half the size of the wild type rendering it practically inactive.",M1

8950197,"Genetic analysis of a Japanese cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis family: identification of a novel mutation in the adrenodoxin binding region of the CYP 27 gene.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), an autosomal recessive lipid-storage hereditary disorder, is caused by mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27). A 24-year-old female Japanese CTX patient and her parents were studied for a CYP 27 mutation. Multiple xanthomas were the main complaint of the patient and plasma cholestanol level was markedly elevated. Sterol analysis of a xanthoma biopsy confirmed cholesterol and cholestanol deposition, and the cholestanol accounted for 8.1% of the total sterols. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in fibroblasts derived from the patient was undetectable, while the activities in fibroblasts from her mother and father were 54% and 41% of the normal level, respectively. Direct sequence analysis showed a missense mutation of A for G substitution in the CYP 27 gene at codon 362 (CGT 362Arg to CAT 362His) with a homozygous pattern in the patient, and a heterozygous pattern in the parents. The mutation, which eliminates a normal HgaI endonuclease site at position 1195 of the cDNA and is located at the adrenodoxin binding region of the gene, is most probably responsible for the decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in this Japanese CTX family. The combined data strongly support that the primary enzymatic defect in CTX is the disruption of sterol 27-hydroxylase and that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait.",M1
8863874,"Chronic diarrhoea as a dominating symptom in two children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.The objective of this study was to describe diarrhoea as a dominating symptom of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>), a lipid storage disease, and investigate its cause. Two children with chronic diarrhoea as the dominating symptom of CTX are presented. Before and after therapy with orally administered chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg kg-1 24 h, in three divided doses) bile alcohol excretion in urine, serum cholestanol level, serum bile acid patterns and faecal bile acids were measured. All routine gastro-intestinal investigations before therapy were normal. Diarrhoea ceased immediately after starting treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Abnormal bile alcohol excretion in urine decreased rapidly during the first days and elevated serum cholestanol level normalized in 2 years. We postulate the presence of bile alcohols in the lumen of the gut as most likely cause for diarrhoea in CTX, since the rapid decrease of bile alcohol excretion is associated with prompt cessation of diarrhoea after starting treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.",M1
8827518,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis caused by two new mutations of the sterol-27-hydroxylase gene that disrupt mRNA splicing.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is an inherited sterol storage disease associated with the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in various tissues. CTX is caused by a deficiency of sterol-27-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme that oxidizes the side chain of cholesterol in the pathway leading to the formation of bile acids. In the present study we report two mutations of sterol-27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27 gene) found in Italian CTX patients. Proband T.C. is homozygous for a G--&gt;A transition at the first nucleotide of intron 7. This mutation causes the formation of minute amounts of an abnormal mRNA, in which exon 6 joins directly to exon 8 with the skipping of exon 7. The exon 6-exon 8 junction results in a frame shift, downstream from the codon for Arg362, which generates a string of 28 novel amino acids preceding a premature termination codon. Proband C.U. is homozygous for a G--&gt;C transversion at the last nucleotide of exon 3. This mutation, which changes the consensus sequence of the 5' donor splice site, is associated with barely detectable levels of sterol-27-hydroxylase mRNA, of normal size, in proband fibroblasts. As both mutations change the sites for two restriction enzymes, rapid methods were devised for the identification of the healthy carriers among the probands' family members and for the screening of these mutations in other CTX patients.",M1

The patient was diagnosed as having cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) based on the high serum cholestanol level and diminished enzymatic activity of 27-hydroxylase of fibroblasts from her skin. Her clinical presentation was atypical regarding the presence of hemiparkinsonism and absence of apparent cataract, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia. Although MRI studies could not detect any abnormality in the basal ganglia or midbrain, PET analysis using [18F]-6-fluoro-L-dopa revealed reduced uptake of dopamine into the putamen, suggesting the impairment of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons.",M1
8728327,"Partial deletion of the gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase in a subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.An Italian subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) was found to have a partial deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27 gene). Southern blot analysis revealed that this deletion (approximately 2 kb) spans from intron 6 to the 3' flanking (3'FLK) region, eliminating exons 7-9, the last three exons of CYP27 gene. No sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA was detected in proband cells, either by Northern blot analysis or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This suggests that the mutant mRNA devoid of the exon encoding the whole untranslated sequence (exon 9) might be rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. We used inverse PCR to obtain a partial sequence of the 3'FLK region of the normal CYP27 gene; this allowed us to define the mechanism underlying the deletion. The established sequence was used to design suitable primers to perform step-wise sequences of a 1.7 kb segment of the 3'FLK region of the normal gene and of the deletion joint in the CTX patient. The analysis of the sequence data indicate that the deletion might result from a complex mechanism involving two intragenic recombinations between a) two 14 nucleotide complementary sequences, one in intron 6 and the other in the 3'FLK region: and b) AT-rich complementary sequences of the 3'FLK region, and a slipped mispairing between two 6 nucleotide direct repeats, one in intron 6 and the other in the 3'FLK region. Such repeats are brought close to each other by the formation of the stem-loops induced by the two intragenic recombinations. This is the first example of CTX caused by a rearrangement of CYP27 gene.",M1
8728324,"A novel mutation in the cytochrome P450(27) (CYP27) gene caused cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Japanese family.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disease caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450(27) (CYP27) gene. This disease is characterized by the accumulation of a bile alcohol, cholestanol, in diverse tissues. Accumulation in the central nervous system leads to neurological dysfunction including dementia, spinal cord paresis, and cerebellar ataxia. Accumulation in other tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cataracts. In a Japanese family with CTX, we identified two points mutations in the CYP27 gene at different sites. One is a novel transversion, which substitutes G for C at Pro 368 (CCC) to Arg (CGC). The other is a transition, which substitutes A for G at Arg441 (CGG) to Gln (CAG), this being the same mutation that Kim et al. reported (1994. J. Lipid Res. 35: 1031 - 1039). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the father and mother of this family, who themselves had no clinical manifestations of CTX, had the former and latter mutations heterozygously, respectively. On the other hand, the patients each had both mutations heterozygously. These results are highly suggestive, but not conclusive, that the newly identified transversion in the CYP27 gene accounts for the sterol 27-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.15) deficiency in these patients.",M1

Hence specimens of liver from four affecteds were examined by light and electron microscopy. These revealed perisinusoidal fibrosis, bile canalicular alterations and hepatocellular alterations including the appearance of fat droplets, proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigment, foci of cytoplasmic degeneration, proliferation of microbodies and prominent mitochondrial changes.

11344576,"Increased formation of ursodeoxycholic acid in patients treated with chenodeoxycholic acid.The formation of ursodeoxycholic acid, the 7 beta-hydroxy epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid, was investigated in three subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and in four subjects with gallstones. Total biliary bile acid composition was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography before and after 4 months of treatment with 0.75 g/day of chenodeoxycholic acid. Individual bile acids were identified by mass spectrometry. Before treatment, bile from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (<e>CTX</e>) subjects contained cholic acid, 85%; chenodeoxycholic acid, 7%; deoxycholic acid, 3%; allocholic acid, 3%; and unidentified steroids, 2%; while bile from gallstone subjects contained cholic acid, 45%; chenodeoxycholic acid, 43%; deoxycholic acid, 11%, and lithocholic acid, 1%. In all subjects, 4 months of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy increased the proportion of this bile acid to approximately 80% and decreased cholic acid to 3% of the total biliary bile acids, the remaining 17% of bile acids were identified as ursodeoxycholic acid. After the intravenous injection of [3H]chenodeoxycholic acid, the specific activity of biliary ursodeoxycholic acid exceeded the specific activity of chenodeoxycholic acid, and the resulting specific activity decay curves suggested precursor-product relationships. When [3H]7-ketolithocholic acid was administrated to another patient treated with chenodeoxycholic acid, radioactivity was detected in both the ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid fractions. These results indicate that substantial amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid are formed in patients treated with chenodeoxycholic acid. The ursodeoxycholic acid was synthesized from chenodeoxycholic acid presumably via 7-ketolithocholic acid.",M1

She developed SLE at 15 years of age, and was treated with prednisolone(PSL) and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>). Sometimes she experienced a flare-up clinically or serologically, requiring a dose increase of oral PSL. At 40 years of age, she visited our hospital after discontinuation of hospital visits for about 4 months. Oral PSL at 30 mg per day was not effective for urinary abnormalities, increase of anti double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titer and decrease in complement components. On admission she had hypertension (180/92 mmHg) and signs of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Renal biopsy findings showed the glomerular changes of lupus nephritis, WHO class IV-G (A), and lupus vasculopathy, which is marked luminal narrowing or total occlusion by abundant subendothelial accumulation of immunoglobulins and complement components.

20373678,"Protective effects of Nigella sativa oil and thymoquinone against toxicity induced by the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide.Constituents of the Nigella sativa seed are reported to possess potent antioxidant effects. Treatment with anticancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) is associated with significant toxicity due to over-production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in increased levels of oxidative stress. The aim of this study is to test whether or not N. sativa L oil (NSO) or its active ingredient, thymoquinone (TQ), can reduce CTX-induced toxicity. Male albino rats were treated with intraperitoneal administration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 200 mg/Kg CTX followed by intragastric administration of NSO or TQ on alternate days for 12 days. Administration of NSO and TQ was initiated 6 h before or after CTX injection. Twenty-four hours after the last NSO and TQ treatment, blood and liver were harvested to analyse toxicity-related parameters. Treatment with CTX induced significant toxicity as shown by decrease in haemoglobin concentration and increases in blood sugar levels, activities of liver enzymes, bilirubin, urea, creatinine, lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol) and lipid peroxidation in the liver. Treatment with NSO or TQ induced significant reduction in overall toxicity. The antitoxic effects of NSO and TQ were associated with induction of antioxidant mechanisms. These results suggest that administration of NSO or TQ can lower CTX-induced toxicity as shown by an up-regulation of antioxidant mechanisms, indicating a potential clinical application for these agents to minimise the toxic effects of treatment with anticancer drugs.",M2
20234820,"Impact of metronomic UFT/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drug assessed in a new preclinical model of locally advanced orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an intrinsically chemotherapy refractory malignancy. Development of effective therapeutic regimens would be facilitated by improved preclinical HCC models. Currently, most models consist of subcutaneous human tumor transplants in immunodeficient mice; however, these do not reproduce the extensive liver disease associated with HCC or metastasize. To address this deficiency, we developed an orthotopic model. Human HCC cells were transfected with the gene encoding secretable beta-subunit human choriogonadotropin (beta-hCG), which was used as a surrogate marker of tumor burden. The HCC cells were implanted into the left liver lobe of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, after which the efficacy of different therapies was evaluated on established, but liver-confined human Hep3B cell line HCC. Treatments included sorafenib or metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>), UFT, an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug, or doxorubicin either alone or in various combinations, with or without an antiangiogenic agent, DC101, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antibody. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner but caused severe weight loss in SCID mice, thus necessitating use of DC101 in subsequent experiments. Although less toxicity was observed using either single or doublet metronomic chemotherapy without any added antiangiogenic agent, none, provided survival benefit. In contrast, significantly improved overall survival was observed using various combinations of metronomic chemotherapy regimens such as UFT + CTX with DC101. In conclusion, using this model of liver-confined but advanced HCC suggests that the efficacy of a targeted antiangiogenic drug or metronomic chemotherapy can be mutually enhanced by concurrent combination treatment.",M2
20154220,"Cyclophosphamide enhances immunity by modulating the balance of dendritic cell subsets in lymphoid organs.Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>), a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent can enhance immune responses. The ability of CTX to promote the proliferation of effector T cells and abrogate the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been described. In this study, we examined the effects of CTX treatment on dendritic cell (DC) subsets and the subsequent outcome on the effector and suppressive arms of adaptive immunity. In secondary lymphoid tissues, tissue-derived migratory DCs (migratory DCs), lymphoid tissue-resident DCs (resident DCs), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are well described. CTX has profound and selective cytotoxic effects on CD8(+) resident DCs, but not skin-derived migratory DCs or pDCs in lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen, causing an imbalance among these DC subsets. CTX treatment increases the potency of DCs in antigen presentation and cytokine secretion, and partially inhibits the suppressor activity of Tregs. Adoptive transfer of CD8(+) DCs can reconstitute this population in regional draining LNs and abrogate the immune-enhancing effects of CTX in vivo. These findings demonstrate that CTX may improve immune responses by preferentially depleting CD8(+) lymphoid-resident DCs, which leads to diminished Treg suppression and enhanced effector T-cell function in vivo.",M2
20083664,"Cyclophosphamide induces dynamic alterations in the host microenvironments resulting in a Flt3 ligand-dependent expansion of dendritic cells.Preconditioning a recipient host with lymphodepletion can markedly augment adoptive T cell therapy. However, the precise mechanisms involved are poorly understood. In a recent study, we observed a significant increase in the circulating levels of dendritic cells (DCs; CD11c(+)CD11b(+)) during the recovery from cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)-induced lymphodepletion. Herein, we demonstrate that the CTX-induced DC expansion was not altered by adjuvant chemotherapy or tumor burden but was augmented by coadministration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. Although the increase in the number of DCs was preceded by a systemic expansion of a population expressing the phenotype of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gr-1(+)CD11b(+)), depletion of these Gr-1(+) cells had no effect on the noted expansion. Moreover, when Gr-1(high)CD11b(high) cells were sorted from CTX-treated mice and adoptively transferred into control or CTX-treated recipients, they did not differentiate into DCs. Post-CTX expansion of DCs was associated with proliferation of DCs in bone marrow (BM) during the lymphopenic phase and in the blood and spleen during the recovery phase. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of BM cells from CTX-treated mice produced equal numbers of DCs in the blood of either CTX-treated or untreated recipients. CTX induced a dynamic surge in the expression of growth factors and chemokines in BM, where CCR2 and Flt3 signaling pathways were critical for DC expansion. In sum, our data suggest that CTX induces proliferation of DCs in BM prior to their expansion in the periphery. Targeting DCs at these phases would significantly improve their contribution to the clinical application of lymphodepletion to adoptive immunotherapy.",M2
20036354,"Cyclophosphamide induces bone marrow to yield higher numbers of precursor dendritic cells in vitro capable of functional antigen presentation to T cells in vivo.We have shown recently that cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) treatment induced a marked increase in the numbers of immature dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, coinciding with enhanced antigen-specific responses of the adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells. Because this DC expansion was preceded by DC proliferation in bone marrow (BM), we tested whether BM post CTX treatment can generate higher numbers of functional DCs. BM was harvested three days after treatment of C57BL/6 mice with PBS or CTX and cultured with GM-CSF/IL-4 in vitro. Compared with control, BM from CTX-treated mice showed faster generation and yielded higher numbers of DCs with superior activation in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs generated from BM from CTX-treated mice induced comparable adjuvant effects to those induced by control DCs. Taken together, post CTX BM harbors higher numbers of DC precursors capable of differentiating into functional DCs, which be targeted to create host microenvironment riches in activated DCs upon treatment with TLR agonists.",M2
19952956,"Administration of cyclophosphamide changes the immune profile of tumor-bearing mice.Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) is often used to create a  window  for more effective therapeutic tumor vaccination. According to a commonly applied protocol, we injected 2 mg CTX intraperitoneally to mice with small (2 to 3 mm diameter) or large (5 to 7 mm, and in one experiment 8 to 10 mm diameter) subcutaneously growing tumors from the SW1 clone of the K1735 melanoma, euthanized the mice 4 days later and studied the composition of lymphoid cells by flow cytometry in both spleens and tumors. Administration of CTX increased the percentage of CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells with the increase in tumors being significantly greater than in spleens, and it also increased the percentage of B cells in spleens and tumors. Furthermore, CTX dramatically increased the frequency of tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 cells containing interferon gamma, of cells expressing NK1.1, and of cells expressing the dendritic cell markers CD11c, CD80, and CD86, with the greatest increases seen among tumor-infiltrating lymphoid cells (TIL) from mice with small tumors. Although CTX decreased the percentage of TIL that expressed CD4 or CD8 together with CD25 and FoxP3 and were therefore considered to be regulatory T cells, it increased the frequency of TIL that stained for Gr1/CD11b, a marker for myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We conclude that the administration of CTX can favorably impact several cell populations that are involved in tumor rejection. However, since CTX has a limited effect on TIL from tumors larger than a few millimeter in diameter and in view of an increased percentage of myeloid-derived suppressor cells among TIL from mice given CTX there is a need for more effective ways to improve tumor vaccination.",M2

This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent CTX at a single institution from January 2001 until April 2009 and received no induction versus induction with C-1H on a background of tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Those with C-1H received dose-reduced calcineurin inhibitor and no steroids. A total of 220 patients were included, 110 received C-1H and 110 received no induction. Recipient baseline characteristics, donor age and gender were not different between the two groups. Mean tacrolimus levels (ng/mL) for C-1H versus no induction: months 1-3 (8.5 vs. 12.9), month 4-6 (10.2 vs. 13.0), month 7-9 (10.2 vs. 11.9) and month 10-12 (9.9 vs. 11.3) were all significantly lower for the C-1H group, p &lt; 0.001. There were no differences between the C-1H and no induction groups at 12 months for overall survival 85.1% versus 93.6% p = 0.09, but freedom from significant rejection was significantly higher for the C-1H group, 84.5% versus 51.6%, p &lt; 0.0001.

19861704,"Regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor-I expression in the pituitary and ovary by a GnRH agonist and antagonist.The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) and antagonist (GnRH-ant) on the expression of GnRH receptor-I (GnRHR-I) in pituitary and ovaries in cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) chemotherapeutic rats and to investigate the possible mechanism of interventions of GnRH-a and GnRH-ant in CTX-induced ovarian damage. In total, 36 female rats were distributed into 6 groups at random: normal saline (NS) group, CTX group, GnRH-a + NS group, GnRH-a + CTX group, GnRH-ant + NS group, and GnRH-ant + CTX group. After the rats were killed, the expression of GnRHR-I messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins in pituitary and ovaries were examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The distribution of GnRHR-I in various compartments of the ovaries was observed by immunohistochemistry. Significant downregulation of GnRHR-I mRNA and protein expression in the pituitary were observed after treatment with GnRH-a or GnRH-ant. Moreover, GnRH-ant was more potent for this direct and fast inhibition. In ovary, GnRHR-I expression was significantly downregulated by GnRH-a. Although GnRH-ant slightly decreased the ovarian expression of GnRHR-I mRNA, the protein level was only weakly changed. In the ovarian compartment, GnRHR-ant groups had markedly GnRHR-I expression in early and late growing follicles compared to GnRHR-a groups that exhibited decreased expression of GnRHR-I, especially in late growing follicles. In summary, this study presents evidence for the different regulating effects of GnRH-a and GnRH-ant on the expression of GnRHR-I in pituitary and ovaries, which may provide insight into the mechanism of GnRH-a and GnRH-ant interventions on chemotoxic ovarian damage.",M2

There is growing evidence that DHA has some impact against tumors. Our purpose was to evaluate in vitro antitumoral properties of DHA in the murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line. At the same time, we observed the therapeutic effect of DHA combined with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) in the LLC and combined with cisplatin (CDDP) in the human non-small cell lung cancer A549 xenotransplanted carcinoma in vivo. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method, apoptosis was measured by AO/EB double staining and flow cytometry. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor KDR/flk-1 was analyzed by western blotting and RT-PCR. In vivo activity of DHA combined with CTX or CDDP was assayed through tumor growth and metastasis. RESULTS: Dihydroartemisinin exhibited high anti-cancer activity in LLC cell line. DHA also induced apoptosis of LLC cells and influenced the expression of VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1. Furthermore, in both tumor xenografts, a greater degree of growth inhibition was achieved when DHA and chemotherapeutics were used in combination. The affection by DHA combined CTX on LLC tumor metastasis was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Dihydroartemisinin is a potent compound against LLC cell line in vitro. In vivo, the combination strategy of DHA and chemotherapeutics holds promise for the treatment of relatively large and rapidly growing lung cancers.",M2

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect and safety of MET chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) in rats with chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Rats received weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diethylnitrosamine during 16 weeks for induction of HCC. The rats were divided into three groups: MTD group received 40 mg/kg CTX i.p. injection on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle; Control and MET groups received saline and 20 mg/kg CTX i.p. injection twice a week, respectively. The growth-modulating effects and overall survival were compared between the groups. Anti-angiogenic effects were evaluated by a measurement of endothelial cell and VEGFR-2 expression. RESULTS: At 6 weeks of therapy, MTD and MET chemotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in tumor number and size compared with Control group. MET chemotherapy showed more prolonged survival than MTD chemotherapy and Control groups (P &lt; 0.05). MET chemotherapy resulted in a significant decrease in both the micro-vessel density and endothelial proliferation index (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, MET chemotherapy led to a greater decrease in VEGFR-2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MET scheduling not only exhibits anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects, but also prolongs survival without major toxicities in a rat model of HCC. Our results suggest that MET chemotherapy has a high therapeutic value and should be considered for future clinical trials.",M2

B. longum-pBV22210-endostatin (Endo) was proved to have a definite inhibitive effect on tumor growth in our previous study. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of B. longum-pBV22210-GCSF and/or B. longum-pBV22210-Endo combined with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) on H22 and S180 tumor-bearing mice. Based on our previous work, the plasmid pBV22210-GCSF was constructed and transformed by electroporation into B. longum. The B. longum-pBV22210-GCSF and/or B. longum-pBV22210-Endo combined with CTX were applied to treat H22 and S180 tumor-bearing mice. A leukocyte count was carried out and the tumor inhibition rate was calculated after treatment. In our study, CTX combined with B. longum-pBV22210-GCSF significantly raised the leukocyte level of tumor-bearing mice, while combined with B. longum-pBV22210-GCSF alone or B. longum-pBV22210-Endo alone combinations with CTX inhibited tumor growth by over 65%. The results showed that B. longum-pBV22210-GCSF had an effective antagonistic effect on bone marrow inhibited by CTX and could inhibit tumor growth when it was combined with B. longum-pBV22210-Endo and CTX. Our results provide an enhanced understanding of B. longum and GCSF as well as their potential as an adjunctive approach in cancer gene therapy.",M2

Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3 months (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.2 months) and 21 months (95% confidence interval, 12.4-29.4 months), respectively. Toxicity was mild and no grade 3 to 4 toxicities occurred. A significant relationship was found between plasma VEGF and prostate-specific antigen values (r = 0.4223; P &lt; 0.001). VEGF levels significantly increased in nonresponders, whereas the responder patients maintained significantly lower levels of VE-C gene expression after the beginning of the treatment if compared with nonresponder ones. CONCLUSION: Metronomic CTX plus CXB and DEX showed favorable toxicity and activity profile in patients. VE-C gene expression and VEGF levels represent potentially useful pharmacodynamic markers for the clinical response.",M2
19608013,"Role of the spleen in cyclophosphamide-induced hematosuppression and extramedullary hematopoiesis in mice.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is induced in spleens due to various diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of spleen in cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)-induced hematosuppression and EMH in mice. METHODS: Balb/c mice were IP injected with 300 mg/kg CTX 2 weeks after splenectomy or sham operation and randomly sacrificed 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after injection. Blood samples were collected, and spleens were weighed, histologically analyzed, and then used for flow cytometry. RESULTS: There were significant differences in white blood count, red blood count, platelet numbers and hemoglobin concentration between the splenectomized and sham-operated mice after CTX injection. The cellularity of the spleen was reduced 3 days following CTX treatment but then rose 7 days after CTX treatment. The numbers of colony-forming units in the spleen reached a peak 7 days after CTX injection, then declined. Flow cytometry demonstrated the percentage of CD34(+) and CD117(+) cells in the spleen increased 7 days after CTX injection, indicating the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that EMH occurs as a compensatory reaction to CTX-induced hematosuppression in the murine spleen, implying that conservation of the spleen may promote the recovery of cancer patients from chemotherapy-induced hematosuppression.",M2
19533141,"Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis associated with dermatomyositis with nephrotic syndrome.We described a 44-year-old man developing dermatomyositis (DM) and nephrotic syndrome (NS). Renal biopsy revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) with depositions of immunoglobulin and complements. A combination therapy of steroid and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) was found very effective for the patient. Chronic glomerulonephritis is rare in DM. In our review of related literature, membranous glomerulonephritis (MN) is the main type of glomerular lesion, another type is mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (mesPGN). Here we reported a case of DM associated with DPGN developing NS, which was not found in existing literature. Although glomerulonephritis is uncommon in patients with DM, renal pathology is not as simplex as previously thought, and treatment with steroid or/and cytotoxic drugs is favorable for prognosis.",M2
19464751,"High-dose cyclophosphamide-mediated anti-tumor effects by the superior expansion of CD44(high) cells after their selective depletion.As alkylating agents, cyclophosphamides (<e>CTX</e>) are used to treat various cancers and, ironically, to boost immune responses. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the immunomodulatory effect of high-dose CTX in an established tumor model. A single injection of high-dose CTX increased the survival rate of immunocompetent, but not immunodeficient, mice. Notably, 10 days after CTX injection, the number of CD44(high) memory T cells significantly increased, without a selective decrease in the actual number and percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the proportion of Tregs among CD4+ T cells decreased due to expansion of memory and other CD4+ T cell subtypes. This outcome was accompanied by an increase in IL-15 mRNA and up-regulation of IL-15 receptors in the CD44+CD8+ T cell compartment. We postulate that the CTX-induced change in T cell balance may increase anti-tumor immunity.",M2
19460696,"[Protective effect of estrogen against chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in rats]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of estrogen against cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)-induced ovarian failure in female rats. METHODS: Sixty female Wistar rats (2-3 months old) were randomized into 4 groups to receive treatments with normal saline, CTX, estradiol (E2) or CTX+E2. Serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were measured regularly in the 4 groups, and the weight of the ovary and uterus, follicle number and mean diameter of the follicles were compared. RESULTS: Compared with CTX+EE2 group, the CTX group showed significantly increased FSH levels and decreased EE2 levels (P&lt;0.05). The weight of the ovary and uterus and follicle number were significantly lower in CTX group than in CTX+EE2 group (P&lt;0.05). No obvious differences in the indexes were found between the control and CTX+E2 groups. CONCLUSION: Estrogen administration provides protection against CTX-induced ovarian damage in rats.",M2
19447687,"Simultaneous determination of cyclophosphamide and carboxyethylphosphoramide mustard in human plasma using online extraction and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HTLC-ESI-MS/MS).A rapid and selective method for simultaneous determination of cyclophosphamide and its metabolite carboxyethylphosphoramide mustard (CEPM) was developed using online sample preparation and separation with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Diluted plasma was injected onto an extraction column (Cyclone MAX 0.5 mm x 50 mm, &gt;30 microm), the sample matrix was washed with an aqueous solution, and retained analytes were transferred to an analytical column (Gemini 3 microm C18 110A, 100 mm x 2.0 mm) using a gradient mobile phase prior to detection by MS/MS. Analytes were detected in an API-3000 LC-MS/MS system using positive multiple-reaction monitoring mode (m/z 261/140 and 293/221 for <e>CTX</e> and CEPM, respectively). Online extraction recoveries were 76% and 72% for cyclophosphamide and CEPM. Within-day and between-day variabilities were &lt;3.0%, and accuracies were between -6.9% and 5.2%. This method has been used to measure plasma cyclophosphamide and CEPM concentrations in an ongoing Phase II study in children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma.",M2
19417562,"Anti-4-1BB scFv immunogene therapy and low dose cyclophosphamide exhibit a synergistic antitumor effect in established murine lung tumors.T-cell costimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB may provide a distinct and important signal for promoting positive immune regulation. 4-1BB is thought to have potential use as a cancer immunotherapeutic drug. In our previous study, a nonreplicative adenovirus (Ad.4-1BB scFv) carrying single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) specific for the 4-1BB gene (anti-4-1BB scFv) possessed remarkable in vivo anti-hepatoma efficacy. However, monotherapy achieved by triggering 4-1BB signaling was not sufficient to induce eradicative antitumor activities in low immunogenic tumors. It is of great interest to explore any possible synergistic antitumor effect of 4-1BB signaling combined with low dose cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>), which is well documented to inhibit the suppressive capability of regulatory T-cells in mice and humans. In the present study, recombinant nonreplicative adenoviruses carrying an anti-4-1BB scFv gene were generated, characterized and explored for their stimulation of antilung tumor (TC-1) immunity in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Compared to adenovirus and cyclophosphamide alone, adenovirus-mediated anti-4-1BB scFv in combination with low dose CTX treatment could obviously augment the antitumor activity, in which some established TC-1 tumors were eradicated and the survival of mice was significantly extended. This synergistic antitumor effect could be largely attributed to the depletion of T regulatory cells induced by low dose CTX. These findings may provide a new and promising strategy for immunogene therapy against cancer.",M2
19414558,"OX40 engagement and chemotherapy combination provides potent antitumor immunity with concomitant regulatory T cell apoptosis.Expansion and recruitment of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T reg) cells are mechanisms used by growing tumors to evade immune elimination. In addition to expansion of effector T cells, successful therapeutic interventions may require reduction of T reg cells within the tumor microenvironment. We report that the combined use of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and an agonist antibody targeting the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 (OX86) provides potent antitumor immunity capable of regressing established, poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma tumors. CTX administration resulted in tumor antigen release, which after OX86 treatment significantly enhanced the antitumor T cell response. We demonstrated that T reg cells are an important cellular target of the combination therapy. Paradoxically, the combination therapy led to an expansion of T reg cells in the periphery. In the tumor, however, the combination therapy induced a profound T reg cell depletion that was accompanied by an influx of effector CD8(+) T cells leading to a favorable T effector/T reg cell ratio. Closer examination revealed that diminished intratumoral T reg cell levels resulted from hyperactivation and T reg cell-specific apoptosis. Thus, we propose that CTX and OX40 engagement represents a novel and rational chemoimmunotherapy.",M2

METHODS: The Semen litchi or <e>CTX</e> containing serum and control serum were prepared by serologic pharmacology method. MTT assay was used to observe the proliferation inhibition rate of HepG2 cells after incubated with different kinds of drug's containing serum. Nuclear morphological features of HepG2 cells were detected by fluorescencemicroscopy after staining with Hochest33258. The apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells in each group was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The cell viability and the apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells in Semen Litchi containing serum groups were higher than that of control group, and the results of fluorescencemicroscopy observation showed the nuclear morphological change of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Semen Litchi can inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells, the acting mechanism may be concerned with cell apoptosis.",M2
19201856,"Recovery from cyclophosphamide-induced lymphopenia results in expansion of immature dendritic cells which can mediate enhanced prime-boost vaccination antitumor responses in vivo when stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C).Recent preclinical studies suggest that vaccination following adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells into a lymphopenic host can augment the therapeutic antitumor responses of the transferred cells. However, the mechanism by which the lymphopenic microenvironment benefits Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses remains elusive. We show herein that induction of lymphodepletion by a single 4 mg cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) treatment induces a marked expansion of immature dendritic cells (DCs) in the peripheral blood on days 8-16 post-CTX (termed restoration phase). In vitro, these DCs were functional, because they showed normal phagocytosis and effective Ag presentation capability upon activation. In vivo, administration of the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) at the peak of DC expansion (day 12 postlymphopenia) induced inflammatory cytokine production and increases in the number of activated DCs in lymph nodes. Importantly, boosting with gp100(25-33) melanoma peptide combined with poly(I:C) 12 days after an initial priming with the same regimen significantly increased the expansion and the antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred pmel-1 CD8(+) T cells. These responses were abrogated after depletion of activated DCs during Ag boosting. In conclusion, our data show that CTX treatment induces, during the restoration phase, expansion of immature DCs, which are functional and can be exploited in vivo to foster more effective antitumor adoptive immunotherapy strategies.",M2
19190115,"Mechanisms involved in synergistic anticancer effects of anti-4-1BB and cyclophosphamide therapy.Chemotherapy can precondition for immunotherapy by creating an environment for homeostatic lymphoproliferation and eliminating some of the suppressive immune networks. We found that combination therapy with anti-4-1BB and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) produced synergistic anticancer effects in the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma model in mice. The antitumor effect of the combination therapy depended mainly on CD8(+) T cells, the 4-1BB-dependent expansion and differentiation of which into IFN-gamma-producing CD11c(+)CD8(+) T cells was enhanced by CTX. Anti-4-1BB induced a rapid repopulation of T and B cells from CTX-mediated lymphopenia. Anti-4-1BB protected naïve T cells from CTX and promoted proliferation of memory/effector and memory T cells. The combination treatment produced approximately 60- and 2.2-fold more CTLs per tumor-associated antigen compared with CTX or anti-4-1BB alone, respectively. This indicates that anti-4-1BB promoted a preferential expansion of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells among the repopulated lymphocytes following CTX-mediated lymphopenia. CTX treatment enhanced 4-1BB expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, and CTX alone or in combination with anti-4-1BB effectively suppressed peripheral regulatory T cells. Our results indicate that anti-4-1BB and CTX can be practical partners in cancer therapy because CTX creates an environment in which anti-4-1BB actively promotes the differentiation and expansion of tumor-specific CTLs.",M2
19177203,"Cyclophosphamide enhances human tumor growth in nude rat xenografted tumor models.The effect of the immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) on tumor growth was investigated in primary and metastatic intracerebral and subcutaneous rat xenograft models. Nude rats were treated with CTX (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 24 hours before human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3), small cell lung carcinoma (LX-1 SCLC), and glioma (UW28, U87MG, and U251) tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or in the right cerebral hemisphere or were infused into the right internal carotid artery. Tumor development was monitored and recorded. Potential mechanisms were further investigated. Only animals that received both CTX and Matrigel showed consistent growth of subcutaneous tumors. Cyclophosphamide pretreatment increased the percentage (83.3% vs 0%) of animals showing intraperitoneal tumors. In intracerebral implantation tumor models, CTX pretreatment increased the tumor volume and the percentage of animals showing tumors. Cyclophosphamide increased lung carcinoma bone and facial metastases after intra-arterial injection, and 20% of animals showed brain metastases. Cyclophosphamide transiently decreased nude rat white blood cell counts and glutathione concentration, whereas serum vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly elevated. Cyclophosphamide also increased CD31 reactivity, a marker of vascular endothelium, and macrophage (CD68-positive) infiltration into glioma cell-inoculated rat brains. Cyclophosphamide may enhance primary and metastatic tumor growth through multiple mechanisms, including immune modulation, decreased response to oxidative stress, increased tumor vascularization, and increased macrophage infiltration. These findings may be clinically relevant because chemotherapy may predispose human cancer subjects to tumor growth in the brain or other tissues.",M2
19168513,"Cyclophosphamide-evoked heart failure involves pronounced co-suppression of cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase activity and non-protein free thiol level.AIMS: Heart failure is a life-threatening complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) chemotherapy, and the present study aimed at identifying the mechanism involved in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: CTX at 800 mg/kg resulted in heart failure, in which cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) activity and non-protein free thiol (NPFT) level were suppressed by 90 and 62%, respectively. The combination of 350 mg/kg CTX and the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) also evoked heart failure, in which TrxR1 activity and NPFT level were suppressed by 66 and 62%, respectively. NPFT depletion alone by BSO did not cause cardiac toxicity. CTX at 350 mg/kg alone also did not cause cardiac toxicity, even though it suppressed TrxR1 activity by 68%. Previous studies have shown that half inactivation of TrxR1 in tumour, bladder, and kidneys was associated with toxicological consequences. Cardiac TrxR1 is dispensable, but cardiac cytoplasmic thioredoxin (Trx1) is essential. The potential uncoupling between TrxR1 and Trx1 may explain why there is no cardiac toxicity following TrxR1 inhibition. However, TrxR1 inactivation may still play a role in CTX-evoked heart failure because inactivated TrxR1 gains cytotoxic function, which may engender noticeable toxicity when massive NPFT is deleted. CONCLUSION: CTX-evoked heart failure involves pronounced co-suppression of TrxR1 activity and NPFT level.",M2
19094445,"Anti-tumour effects of exosomes in combination with cyclophosphamide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid.We examined the anti-tumour activity of exosomes derived from dendritic cells (DCs) in combination with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt (poly I:C). DCs were pulsed with L1210 lymphocytic leukaemia cell antigen and lipopolysaccharide. The exosomes that the DCs secreted were purified. In vitro, the anti-tumour activity of exosomes was assessed by measuring their ability to induce spleen cell proliferation and the extent to which they induced spleen cells to kill L1210 cells. Poly I:C was able to induce DC maturation. DC-derived exosomes stimulated spleen cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of spleen cells in vitro. DC-derived exosomes, in combination with CTX and poly I:C, suppressed L1210 tumour growth in vivo and gave the greatest prolongation of survival time in tumour-bearing DBA2 mice. These findings suggest that this combination of a tumour vaccine, a conventional anti-cancer agent and a promoter of DC maturation might be a useful anti-cancer therapy.",M2
19082918,"Chitosan hydrogel containing GMCSF and a cancer drug exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects via the induction of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.Cancer treatments consisting of a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been vigorously exploited to further improve the efficacy of cancer therapies. In this study, we utilized a chitosan hydrogel (CH) system loaded with GMCSF and a cancer drug as a chemo-immunotherapeutic agent in an effort to assess the effects on tumor growth in mice using TC-1 cervical tumor cells, which express the tumor-specific antigen, HPV-16 E7. The growth of TC-1 tumors was significantly reduced in mice treated with a CH harboring a cancer drug (doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CDDP), or cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)) and GMCSF (CH-a cancer drug + GMCSF), as compared to other groups that were treated with CH containing only a cancer drug(CH-a cancer drug) or GMCSF(CH-GMCSF). Among the cancer drugs, CTX exerted the most potent anti-tumor effects. Interestingly, the intra-tumoral injection of CH-a cancer drug + GMCSF induced a significant E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune response as compared to CH-GMCSF or CH-a cancer drug. This enhancement of tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell immunity was associated principally with the anti-tumor effects induced by CH-CTX + GMCSF, as demonstrated by antibody depletion. Collectively, the aforementioned results indicate that co-treatment of tumors with a combination of GMCSF and a cancer drug incorporated into a CH system results in synergistic anti-tumor effects, which occur via the induction of a tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. This study demonstrates the use of a biodegradable hydrogel system for the co-delivery of an immunoadjuvant and an anti-cancer drug for successful chemo-immunotherapy.",M2

METHODS: Thirty-six female SD rats were divided randomly into 6 groups to receive treatment with normal saline (NS), CTX, GnRH-a+NS, GnRH-a+CTX, GnRH-ant+NS, GnRH-ant+CTX, respectively. The rats were sacrificed between the first and second week after termination of the medication to compare the weight of the ovaries, the number of the primordial follicles and the follicle growth. The expressions of bcl-2 and bax mRNA in the ovaries were examined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The number of the primordial follicles was significantly greater and that of the growing follicles significantly lower in GnRH-a+NS and GnRH-a+CTX groups than in the GnRH-ant+CTX and CTX groups (P&lt;0.05). The rats in GnRH-a+NS and GnRH-a+CTX groups had the lowest ovarian weight among 6 the groups (P&lt;0.05). The bcl-2 mRNA level in the GnRH-ant+NS group was significantly higher than that in the other groups (P&lt;0.05). The Bax mRNA in the GnRH-a+NS and GnRH-a+CTX groups was significantly higher than that in the NS group (P&lt;0.05), but close to that in the CTX group (P&gt;0.05); bax mRNA expression in the GnRH-ant+NS group was significantly lower than that in the NS group (P&lt;0.05), but in GnRH-ant+CTX group, its expression was close to that in the NS group (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In female rats exposed to CTX, the GnRH analogs provides ovarian protection against CTX-induced gonadotoxicity by regulating the expression of the Bax mRNA in the ovary. GnRH-a may decrease the sensitivity of the follicles to CTX-induced gonadotoxicity by promoting follicle apoptosis and inhibiting follicle proliferation, and GnRH-ant increases the sensitivity to the CTX through a reverse effect on the follicles.",M2
19004041,"Cost comparison between mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide-azathioprine in the treatment of lupus nephritis.OBJECTIVE: To compare the healthcare expenditure associated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based immunosuppression in contrast to conventional therapy in patients with lupus nephritis. METHODS: Our retrospective single-center study compared the major healthcare costs during the first 24 months of treatment incurred by immunosuppressive medications, hospitalization, and complications in patients with severe lupus nephritis who had been treated with prednisolone and either MMF or sequential cyclophosphamide induction followed by azathioprine maintenance (<e>CTX</e>-AZA). RESULTS: Forty-four patients were studied (22 in each group). Baseline demographic and clinical measures, and remission rates after treatment, were similar between the 2 groups. Immunosuppressive drug cost was 13.6-fold higher in the MMF group (US$4168.3+/-1176.5 per patient, compared with $285.0+/-70.6 in the CTX-AZA group, mean difference $3883.2+/-251.3; p&lt;0.001). MMF treatment was associated with a lower incidence of infections (12.0 episodes/1000 patient-months, compared with 32.4 in the CTX-AZA group; p=0.035). Combined cost of hospitalization and treatment of infections was 82.5% lower in the MMF group (mean difference -2208.7+/-1700.6; p=0.120). Overall treatment expenditure on immunosuppressive drugs, hospitalization, and treatment of infections was 1.57-fold higher in the MMF group (mean US $4635.9 compared with $2961.5 in the CTX-AZA group; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: While the cost of MMF treatment for severe lupus nephritis is much higher compared with CTX-AZA, the increased drug cost is partially offset by savings from the reduced incidence of complications.",M2
18853660,"[Influence of antiplatelet drugs (AD) on the efectiveness of combined therapy in patients with small cell lung cancer. Part I. Influence of AD on the haemostatic system]In the last years, a sharp rise in the morbidity due to lung cancer is observed, especially in the male population. Despite the intensive, multidirectional development of oncology, early detection and effective treatment of lung cancer is still limited. Its detection is delayed because of the lack of characteristic early signs. Especially poor in prognosis are patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), who usually die in consequence of distant metastases. This may result due to coating of the surface of circulating neoplastic cells with thrombocytes and clots. Platelets aggregates on the surface of neoplastic cells may have a protective action in relation to cytostatic drugs. This is why neoplastic cells that persist through this phase, implant themselves into various organs giving rise to metastases. The aim of the 1st part of the paper was to evaluate the influence of antiplatelet drugs (AD) on the haemostatic system of patients with SCLC. There is data in literature indicating a ameliorating influence of AD on time of survival of patients with certain neoplasms. The study was performed in 87 male patients aged 35-73 years with SCLC, limited to half of the chest (limited disease). After 2 i.v. chemotherapy series in 3 week intervals (VAC scheme according Greco): --Adriamycin (ADR) 40 mg on 1sq.m of body surface; --Vincristin (VCR) 1 mg; on 1sq.m of body surface; --Cyclophosfamid (<e>CTX</e>) 1000 mg on 1sq.m of body surface; radiation was also applied--40 Gy during 20 days on the tumor and mediastinum. The described treatment was performed in 22 patients from controls (Group I). Patients from Group II (n = 22) received additionally Defibrotide, Group III (n = 22) Ticlide and Group IV (n = 21) Aspirin. To evaluate of the influence of AD on the haemostatic system--every 3 months during the consecutive 27 weeks, the following tests were performed: bleeding time, clotting time, platelet aggregation, platelets aggregation ratio, euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT), fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP). It was shown that AD prolonged bleeding and clotting time, increased the threshold ADP and collagen concentration causing platelets aggregation as well as increased platelet aggregation ratio. The used AD (Defibrotide, Ticlide) resulted in activation of the plasma fibrynolytic system as expressed by a shortening of the ECLT, lowering of fibrinogen level and increasing FDP. The influence of observed changes in the haemostatic system, as a result of AD on the remission and survival time of patients with SCLC will be presented in the 2nd part of this paper.",M2
18772494,"Contribution of host-derived tissue factor to tumor neovascularization.OBJECTIVE: The role of host-derived tissue factor (TF) in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis has hitherto been unclear and was investigated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared tumor growth, vascularity, and responses to cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) of tumors in wild-type (wt) mice, or in animals with TF levels reduced by 99% (low-TF mice). Global growth rate of 3 different types of transplantable tumors (LLC, B16F1, and ES teratoma) or metastasis were unchanged in low-TF mice. However, several unexpected tumor/context-specific alterations were observed in these mice, including: (1) reduced tumor blood vessel size in B16F1 tumors; (2) larger spleen size and greater tolerance to CTX toxicity in the LLC model; (3) aborted tumor growth after inoculation of TF-deficient tumor cells (ES TF(-/-)) in low-TF mice. TF-deficient tumor cells grew readily in mice with normal TF levels and attracted exclusively host-related blood vessels (without vasculogenic mimicry). We postulate that this complementarity may result from tumor-vascular transfer of TF-containing microvesicles, as we observed such transfer using human cancer cells (A431) and mouse endothelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study points to an important but context-dependent role of host TF in tumor formation, angiogenesis and therapy.",M2

METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective, controlled study. Twenty-seven MMF therapeutic and twenty-five CTX therapeutic lupus patients with &gt;or=50% crescent formation were enrolled in this study. The general conditions, clinicopathological findings, remission and relapse ratio, and outcomes of them were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference of general condition and clinicopathological findings between MMF and CTX group. At 12 months, the total remission ratio in MMF and CTX group were 73.1% and 69.6%, while the complete remission ratio in MMF group (53.8%) was significantly higher than that in CTX group (26.1%). The relapse ratio in MMF group (10.5%) was significantly lower than in CTX group (43.8%). Forty per cent of PR patients in CTX group suffered from relapse. Until June 2005, the patients in CTX group received a follow time with 38.5 +/- 21.2 (range 10 approximately 80) months, and in MMF group the follow time was 41.1 +/- 27.0 (range 12 approximately 90) months. Two patients in MMF group and two in CTX group entered into end stage renal failure. The side effect of infection was more significant in CTX group. CONCLUSION: Higher complete remission ratio and lower relapse ratio were observed in MMF group than in CTX group. The side effect of infection was more infrequent in MMF group, which showed preferable security of MMF.",M2

In our experiments, we studied CTX-treated T739 mice using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot for markers of proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor progression and distant metastasis. As a result, CTX increased the number and area of metastases and tumor embolus in lungs by effecting on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2. Taken together, it indicated that CTX enhanced the process of pulmonary metastasis by the synergistic effect of matrix-degrading proteases and adhesion proteins.",M2

METHODS: 28 female patients with SLE, aged 35.3 +/- 2.4 (30-39) were treated with prednisone orally 1 mg/kg daily for 8 weeks, and then the dose was decreased by 10% every 10 days. CTX 200 mg with normal saline 200 ml was intravenously injection every other day for 4 months. Peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count was made every week. If the WBC count was less than 3.5 x 10(9)/L, the use of CTX should be stopped temporarily until the WBC count became normal. And then, the CTX administration should be adjusted to 400 mg intravenously every week. All patients were offered treatment with Hypodermic injection of GnRH-a 3.75 mg was given monthly just at the beginning of the standard CTX regimen for 3 months. Follow-up was conducted for 6 months after the last prescription of GnRH-a. RESULTS: All patients developed amenorrhea after treated by GnRH-a. Menstruation recovered 73 days (69-82 days) after the last subcutaneous injection in 25 patients. Among these 25 patients, one developed amenorrhea again after two normal menses periods. The other 3 patients were in persistent amenorrhea during the following 6 months after the GnRH-a treatment. The levels of plasma estradiol (E2) was 998 +/- 308 pmol/L before GnRH-a treatment, and decreased significantly 1, 2, and 3 months after the last injection of GnRH-a (132 +/- 44 pmol/L, 88 +/- 37 pmol/L and 81 +/- 29 pmol/L respectively, all P &lt; 0.05). The level of plasma E2 increased 2 months after the last injection of GnRH-a in the 25 patients with return of menses, and the level of plasma E2 returned to the normal baseline level after 6 months in 24 patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment with GnRH-a during CTX therapy is associated with a significant reduction of premature ovarian failure in most women with SLE.",M2
18726131,"Neural progenitor cell-mediated delivery of interferon beta improves neuroblastoma response to cyclophosphamide.BACKGROUND: We have shown that continuous systemic delivery of interferon beta (IFN-beta) remodels dysfunctional tumor vasculature, thereby improving tumor perfusion and enhancing delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. We hypothesized that because of their inherent tumor tropism, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) engineered to express IFN-beta could also effect maturation of tumor vasculature without generating high systemic levels of IFN-beta. METHODS: Mice with luciferase-expressing disseminated human neuroblastoma were divided into four groups of equal tumor burden by bioluminescence imaging: (1) untreated controls; (2) NPC-IFN-beta only; (3) cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) only; and (4) NPC-IFN-beta in combination with CTX. Two million NPC-IFN-beta cells were administered twice, 7 days apart, starting 21 days after tail vein administration of tumor cells. CTX was administered every 6 days for three doses. Mice were killed at 6 weeks, livers and kidneys weighed, and tumor removed for immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells (CD34), pericytes (alpha-SMA), apoptosis (TUNEL [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling]), and diI-labeled NPCs. RESULTS: Fluorescent-labeled NPCs confirmed localization of these cells to tumors. The alpha-SMA/CD34 ratio, a marker for vascular maturation, greatly increased in NPC-IFN-beta-treated tumors compared with controls. Bioluminescent signal from luciferase-expressing tumor cells, reflecting tumor burden, was lower with combination therapy than control or either monotherapy, and combination therapy resulted in far less tumor burden by weight in the kidneys and liver. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted delivery of IFN-beta with NPCs produced low circulating levels of IFN-beta, yet the maturing effect on the tumor vasculature and the enhanced efficacy of adjuvant therapy was maintained. Thus, combination therapy of NPC-IFN-beta with CTX warrants further investigation for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma patients.",M2
18718065,"[Antiproliferative effect of curcumin combined with cyclophosmide on the growth of human lymphoma cell line HT/<e>CTX</e> with drug resistance and its relation with FA/BRCA pathway]The aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative effect of curcumin combined with cyclophosmide on the growth of human lymphoma cell line HT/CTX with drug resistance and its relation with FA/BRCA pathway. The inhibitory effects of the drugs on the growth of HT/CTX cells were determined by MTT assay. Cell cycle phase and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of FANCD2 protein in FA/BRCA pathway was determined by Western blot. The results indicated that the combination of curcumin with CTX had an additional synergistic inhibitory effects on the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of HT/CTX cells. The curcumin could enhance toxicity of CTX on HT/CTX cells through inhibition of FA/BRCA pathway which was realized by suppression of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. The curcumin combined with CTX could increase apoptosis inducing effect on HT/CTX cells, while the curcumin or CTX alone did not showed this effect, and without inhibition of FA/BRCA pahtway. It is concluded that combination of curcumin and CTX produces synergistic effects and reverses multiple drug resistance of HT/CTX cells effectively. The prevention of cells from entering the next cell cycle and down regulation of FANCD2 protein monoubiquitination may be involved in the mechanism.",M2
18711291,"A clinicopathological study of lupus nephritis in children.To assess clinical characteristics, pathological findings, and therapeutic response in children with lupus nephritis (LN), we retrospectively studied 25 children under 16 years of age with LN at the Abozar children's hospital from 1995 to 2006. The study included 13(65%) girls and 7(35%) boys. The mean age at the time of diagnosis of SLE was 10.2 (+/- 4.8) years. Eighteen patients (90%) were more than 8 years old. Sixty percent of the patients presented as nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. All the patients underwent percutaneous renal biopsy and were followed up for at least 36 months. The clinical and serologic parameters at the time of renal biopsy were recorded. Twenty patients were treated with the following regimens: one (class I) with low dose prednisone, 7 (class II, III) with high-dose of prednisone, 12 (class IV) with high-dose prednisone plus 13 intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) pulses (monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months), followed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as maintenance therapy. Remission was achieved in 17 (85%) cases; one required hemodialysis and 2 died due to renal failure and central nervous system involvement. Among 12 cases with class IV, 11 responded to prednisone and intravenous CTX pulses. We conclude that i.v. pulses of CTX induced clinical remission of renal disease in the majority of children with severe LN. MMF maintenance therapy was effective after induction of remission in refractory cases. However, this study was performed in a small number of subjects, further studies to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of CTX pulse therapy on larger numbers of patients are warranted.",M2
18692125,"Protective effect of triterpenoid fractions from the rhizomes of Astilbe chinensis on cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity in tumor-bearing mice.AIM OF THE STUDY: The objectives of this study were to investigate the protective effect of the triterpenoid fractions from the rhizomes of Astilbe chinensis (Saxifragaceae) (ATF) on cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)-induced toxicity in tumor-bearing mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice inoculated with mouse sarcoma S180 cells were treated with saline or CTX alone, or co-treated with CTX and ATF. The blood, femur bone, and serum samples were collected for determination of the haematological and biochemical parameters and splenocytes were for assay of proliferation, the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). RESULTS: ATF significantly increased the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow cellularity (BMC) in CTX-treated S180-bearing mice. Increase of aspartate transanimase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine in the serum of CTX-treated mice was significantly reversed by ATF. The lowered levels of splenocytes proliferation, NK cells activity, and IL-2 production from splenocytes in S180-bearing mice after CTX treatment were also increased by ATF administration. CONCLUSIONS: ATF provides significant protection against CTX-induced hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and immunotoxicity, and might be helpful in abrogation of CTX-induced toxicity during the chemotherapy.",M2
18690526,"Cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic administration of common cancer chemotherapeutics in rats.Although cognitive dysfunction manifested by severe memory and attention deficits has been reported in up to 70% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, the mechanisms of this serious side effect have not been defined. In particular, it has not been decisively resolved whether the dysfunction is attributable to the chemotherapy or to the malignancy itself. In the present study we tested whether cognitive dysfunction can be induced in an experimental setting by the administration of commonly used chemotherapeutics to rats. Female 10 month old Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with a combination of 2.5 mg/kg of adriamycin (ADR) and 25 mg/kg of cytoxan (<e>CTX</e>). A total of four doses were given at weekly intervals. The control group was treated with saline only. No mortality and no apparent morbidity were observed in either group. However, the chemotherapeutic treatment severely impaired memory function of rats as measured by a passive avoidance test. This memory deficiency was fully prevented by the administration of an antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) injected subcutaneously three times a week at 200 mg/kg in the course of chemotherapeutic treatment. These results indicate that chemotherapeutic agents alone, i.e., in the absence of malignancy, damage the brain resulting in memory dysfunction. Moreover, the results strongly indicate that the damaging effect is mediated by oxidative stress, as memory dysfunction is preventable by the co-administration of NAC.",M2
18619249,"[Study on the effect of Part III from Cynomorium songaricum on immunosuppressive mice induced by cyclophosphamide]OBJECTIVE: To study the immunomodulatory effect of Part III of Cynomorium songaricum Rupr. on the immunosuppressive mice. METHODS: The immunity-deficiency model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) at the dose of 100 mg/kg in mice; all the animals were divided into normal control group, immunity-deficiency model group, Part III treated group (300 mg/kg) and positive control group (TSPG, 300 mg/kg). The hemogram of peripheral blood, the index of immune organs, the phagocytosis activity of macrophage, the content of serum hemolysin were measured. RESULTS: The index of organs, the phagocytosis activity of macrophage and the content of serum hemolysin in the model group increased after administrated of Part III. CONCLUSION: Part III from Cynomorium songaricum Rupr. has protective effect on the immunosuppressive mice, which may be related to the increasing of humoral immunity and nonspecific immunity.",M2
18540827,"Immune-potentiating effects of the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide.Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) is an alkylating cytotoxic drug that primarily affects proliferating lymphocytes. CTX has been extensively used as a chemotherapeutic and disease-modifying agent against certain solid tumors, lymphomas, and some autoimmune conditions. Depending on its dose and timing of administration, CTX can also enhance immune responses. These opposing immune functions of CTX have been investigated in numerous animal models and recent clinical studies. Administration of CTX augments delayed type 1 hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, can precipitate type 1 diabetes, and boosts antitumor responses in both vaccination and adoptive cell transfer models. Although the mechanisms by which CTX elicits these effects are not fully understood, CTX treatment has a differential effect on lymphocyte compartments, rapidly depleting B and T cells. This is followed by a recovery phase characterized by extensive proliferation and bone marrow mobilization. The proposed underlying mechanisms of augmentation of immune responses include the facilitation of homing and homeostatic proliferation by the creation of space, the skewing of Th2/Th1 responses due to the cytokine storm during the recovery phase, and the removal or inhibition of a suppressor cell population. With the identification of naturally occurring and peripheral regulatory T cells, recent studies have re-evaluated these hypotheses and suggest that CTX inhibits the function of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In this review, we critically evaluate relevant historical and recent data on CTX-mediated immunomodulation and discuss the resulting implications for immunotherapy.",M2
18538085,"[Changes and significance of peripheral blood platelet count in tumor shrinkage induced by a low dose of <e>CTX</e> in T739 mice]AIM: To establish a mouse model for BTT739 tumor-bearing mice cured by a low dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX). And then to observe the dynamic changes and significance of peripheral blood counts especially blood platelet count during tumor shrinkage induced by a low dose of CTX in T739 mice. METHODS: Mouse bladder carcinoma tissues were inoculated subcutaneously into T739 mice. Seven days later, different doses of CTX or the same volume of NS were administered intraperitoneally to treat these tumor-bearing T739 mice. Tumor sizes were observed and recorded subsequently to find out the minimal dose of CTX that could cure most of these tumor-bearing mice. Then another 12 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into 15 mg/kg CTX treatment group and control group. Blood samples were obtained from orbital venous sinus on different times after CTX treatment. Complete blood counts were performed and the relationship between peripheral blood platelet counts and tumor shrinkage was analyzed. RESULTS: Within 2 weeks after CTX treatment, the speed of tumor shrinkage had a positive relationship with the dose of CTX used; but the survival rate of the tumor-bearing mice had a negative relationship with the dose of CTX used in 2 months after CTX treatment. 15 mg/kg CTX could cure most of the tumor bearing mice, while it had no remarkably inhibitive effects on peripheral blood cells. The perpherial platelet count increased to (1483.4+/-184.4)x10(9)/L in mice 6 h after CTX treatment. There was significant difference compared with that in mice of control group (1086.6+/-81.0)x10(9)/L (P&lt;0.01). During the 2nd to 14th day after CTX treatment, there was no obvious difference in the platelet count between treatment group and control group (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: CTX 15 mg/kg could cure most of bladder tumor-bearing T739 mice. The transient increase of the peripheral platelet count in 6 h after CTX treatment may relate to the antitumor effects of CTX.",M2
20029469,"Phase II trial of metronomic chemotherapy as salvage therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.AIM OF WORK: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of metronomic chemotherapy (which is the continuous administration of chemotherapy at relatively low minimally toxic doses on a frequent schedule of administration at close regular intervals with no prolonged drug-free breaks) in metastatic breast cancer patients as salvage therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II study we evaluated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of low dose, oral Methotrexate (MTX) and Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Between January 2004 and December 2005, 42 patients received MTX 2.5mg bid on day 1 and 2 each week and CTX 50mg/day administered continuously. RESULTS: Forty two patients were evaluable. The overall clinical benefit was 31% complete response, partial response and stable disease (CR+PR+SD &gt;or=24 weeks), while the overall response rate was 16.7% (none of the patients attained CR). Toxicity was generally mild. The most common non hematological toxicity was elevation in transaminases level, it was reported in 40.4% of patients and was reversible, while mild grade 1 or 2 neutropenia was the most common hematological toxicity, (28.5% of patients). Median time to response was 3+/-0.18 while progression free survival (PFS) among patients with clinical benefit was 10 months (95% CI 6.65-13.44). CONCLUSIONS: This phase II study shows that, the combination of continuously low dose MTX and CTX is an active minimally toxic and significantly cost effective regimen for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients.",M2
18463325,"Delayed severe pneumonia in mycophenolate mofetil-treated patients with IgA nephropathy.BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a relatively new immunosuppressant, is widely used in the field of transplantation and also for autoimmune diseases with good tolerance. It has been reported that MMF possesses potent activity against pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This study investigated the effects of this treatment on the occurrence of severe pneumonia (SP) including PCP and its risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Of 850 IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients that were followed up in our renal centre, 32 received MMF (1-1.5 g/day) and 47 were treated with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>; 50-100 mg/day). All the patients also received prednisone. SP was defined as diffuse bilateral lung infiltrate with respiratory failure, and PCP was diagnosed by detecting organisms in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage. RESULTS: Patients given MMF or CTX did not differ in their distribution of age, sex, renal function or prednisone dosage. However, 6 of the 32 patients developed SP around the third month after the initiation of MMF administration: 3 were diagnosed with PCP, 2 with suspected PCP and in the other PCP could not be excluded. SP did not occur in patients treated with CTX. Most SP cases (five of six) presented with abrupt onset and rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, from which four died. The deterioration of renal function was strongly associated with the occurrence of SP. Six patients (6 of 16) with chronic renal function impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) developed SP while none of the patients with eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) did. Absolute lymphocyte counts decreased significantly in patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) after 3 months of MMF treatment compared to the counts before MMF was initiated (1.71 +/- 0.23 versus 2.43 +/- 0.17 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.04). This effect was more pronounced in patients with SP, which had significantly lower counts than patients without SP (0.22 +/- 0.04 versus 1.91 +/- 0.20 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.001). The occurrence of SP or PCP in patients with chronically impaired renal function was also associated with lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of delayed SP including PCP following MMF plus corticosteroids in patients with IgAN. Chronically impaired renal function might be a risk factor for severe infection, and lymphocyte counts may serve as useful and convenient tools for monitoring the intendance of the occurrence of PCP. This finding and its risk factors need to be further evaluated.",M2
18457249,"[Study on the induction of skin transplantation tolerance against rejection in mice by third-party dendritic cells loaded with donor's antigens]OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the third-party dendritic cells (DC) incubated with donor's antigens possess the similar immune functions with donor derived immature DC. METHODS: Female C57 BL/6, BALB/c and Kunming mice were used as skin transplant donors, recipients and third-party, respectively. Forty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into A (normal control), B (cyclophosphamide administration), C (<e>CTX</e> and donor derived immature DC), D (CTX and third-party immature DC), E (CTX and third-party DC loaded with donor's antigens) groups, with 8 mice in each group. The mice in group B, C, D and E were given CTX (200 mg/Kg) 4 days before operation, while those in group A were given equivalent amount of normal saline(NS). Then in group C, D and E, DC at a dose of 1 x 10(7)/ml were intraperitoneally injected with 2 days before grafting and 12 days after operation, but the mice in group A and B were given NS in the same manner. Mean survival time (MST) of skin grafts was recorded, and biopsies of grafts on 5 and 10 post-operation days (POD) were harvested for histologic examination. RESULTS: Compared with group A [(16.1 +/- 3.5)d], MST of skin grafts in group C [(38.3 +/- 7.7) d] and E [(34.9 +/- 7.7) d] were significantly prolonged ( P &lt; 0.01), while no obvious difference was observed between group C and E( P &gt; 0.05), but there was statistically significant difference in MST between group D [(23.7 +/- 2.7) d] and E ( P &lt; 0.05). In addition, clear epithelial structure and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in specimens from both groups C and E. CONCLUSION: Both donor derived immature DC and third-party DC loaded with donor's antigens can partly induce donor specific transplantation tolerance.",M2
18446337,"Increased circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells correlate with clinical cancer stage, metastatic tumor burden, and doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.Abnormal accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) is an important mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) has also been shown in non-tumor bearing animals to cause transient surges in MDSC. Knowledge of MDSC is primarily based on preclinical work, and to date only few published studies have involved cancer patients. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that circulating MDSC levels correlate with clinical cancer stage, CTX-based chemotherapy, and metastatic tumor burden. Whole blood was collected from 106 newly diagnosed solid tumor patients (stages I-IV). Percentages of circulating MDSC (Lin(-/Lo), HLA DR-, CD33(+)CD11b(+)) were determined prior to initiation of systemic therapy. In 17 early stage breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy every 14 days (ddAC) blood was collected on day 1 of each cycle. Circulating MDSC were significantly increased in cancer patients of all stages relative to healthy volunteers. A significant correlation between circulating MDSC and clinical cancer stage was also observed. Moreover, among stage IV patients, those with extensive metastatic tumor burden had the highest percent and absolute number of MDSC. Significant increases in circulating MDSC were observed with ddAC when compared with pretreatment levels. Circulating MDSC levels correlate with clinical cancer stage, ddAC, and metastatic tumor burden. This information must be incorporated into the design of future trials exploring immune-based therapeutic strategies. Pharmacologic modulation of MDSC should also be tested in future clinical trials.",M2
18313158,"Hyperthermia improves the antitumour effect of metronomic cyclophosphamide in a rat transplantable brain tumour.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and hyperthermia (HT) both exert antitumour effects in part through antiangiogenic mechanisms, interactive effects of the two modalities were explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subcutaneously implanted rat tumours (BT4An) were treated with CTX 35 mg/kg i.p. three doses a week for two weeks, local water-bath HT yielding mean tumour temperature of 43 degrees C for one hour at day 0, both modalities combined (CTX-HT(0)), or saline. TUNEL assays, immunohistochemical staining of thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) and real time RT-PCR of TSP-1 mRNA were analysed the first three hours after completed treatment day 0. RESULTS: Metronomic dosed CTX (p=0.006) and HT (p&lt;0.001) both delayed tumour growth. The combined regimen was superior to either modality alone (p&lt;0.001). Complete tumour regressions were observed in CTX (6%), HT (12%), and CTX-HT(0) (41%) treated rats. TSP-1 protein was specifically upregulated in the vascular matrix of tumours receiving CTX (weak), HT (moderate) and CTX-HT(0) (strong). In contrast, reduced expression of TSP-1 protein was observed in tumour cells after HT alone and CTX-HT(0). TUNEL assays indicated induction of apoptosis by HT and CTX-HT(0) 90 minutes after end of the first treatment. CONCLUSION: A single session of local HT enhances the effects of low-dose metronomic CTX, possibly in part mediated through a differential effect on TSP-1 protein levels in tumour cells and tumour vasculature.",M2
18306113,"Effect of Andrographis paniculata as an adjuvant in combined chemo-radio and whole body hyperthermia treatment - a preliminary study.Modulation of immune responses to alleviate disease has been of interest for a long time. Intraperitoneal administration of Andrographis paniculata extract along with whole body hyperthermia (WBH) was found to enhance the total WBC count in cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and radiation treated animals when compared to untreated control animals. Maximum inhibition in the solid tumor development was observed when the CTX and radiation exposed animals were treated with extract in combination with whole-body hyperthermia. Similarly myeloperoxidase activity in tumor tissue from CTX and radiation-treated animals was also significantly inhibited when they were administered with Andrographis paniculata extract along with whole body hyperthermia. Moreover the production of cytokines such as IL-2 and GM-CSF, which was reduced after combined CTX and radiation treatment was significantly increased by the simultaneous treatment of extract and whole body hyperthermia. The elevated level of serum Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha) level, after CTX and radiation treatment was also lowered significantly after the administration of extract and simultaneous exposure of whole-body hyperthermia with respect to untreated tumor-bearing animals.",M2
18246198,"Chronic morphine use does not induce peripheral tolerance in a rat model of inflammatory pain.Although opioids are highly effective analgesics, they are also known to induce cellular adaptations resulting in tolerance. Experimental studies are often performed in the absence of painful tissue injury, which precludes extrapolation to the clinical situation. Here we show that rats with chronic morphine treatment do not develop signs of tolerance at peripheral mu-opioid receptors (micro-receptors) in the presence of painful CFA-induced paw inflammation. In sensory neurons of these animals, internalization of mu-receptors was significantly increased and G protein coupling of mu-receptors as well as inhibition of cAMP accumulation were preserved. Opioid receptor trafficking and signaling were reduced, and tolerance was restored when endogenous opioid peptides in inflamed tissue were removed by antibodies or by depleting opioid-producing granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>). Our data indicate that the continuous availability of endogenous opioids in inflamed tissue increases recycling and preserves signaling of mu-receptors in sensory neurons, thereby counteracting the development of peripheral opioid tolerance. These findings infer that the use of peripherally acting opioids for the prolonged treatment of inflammatory pain associated with diseases such as chronic arthritis, inflammatory neuropathy, or cancer, is not necessarily accompanied by opioid tolerance.",M2
18196606,"HER2 over-expression and response to different chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer.PURPOSE: To exam the relationship between HER2 over-expression and different adjuvant chemotherapies in breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1625 primary breast cancer patients who received post-surgery adjuvant chemotherapy in Tianjin Cancer Hospital, China, from July 2002 to November 2005 were included in the study. Among them, 600 patients were given CMF (<e>CTX</e>+MTX+5-Fu) regimen, 600 given CEF (CTX+E-ADM+5-Fu) regimen, and 425 given anthracyclines plus taxanes regimen, with mean follow-up time of 42 months. RESULTS: In CMF treatment group, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) in HER2 over-expressed patients was lower than that of the HER2-negative ones (89.80% vs 91.24%, P=0.0348); in node-positive subgroup, the 3-year DFS was 84.72% in HER2 over-expressed patients, and 90.18% in the HER-2-negative ones (P=0.0271). Compared to CMF regimen, anthracyclines and anthracyclines plus taxanes regimens are more effective (P&lt;0.05) in node-positive HER2 over-expression than those in the node-negative. CONCLUSION: HER2 over-expression is an independent index for predicting poor prognosis and short DFS for breast cancer patients. HER2 over-expressed patients are resistant to CMF regimen chemotherapy, but sensitive to anthracyclines-based or anthracyclines plus taxanes regimen. HER2 expression can be taken as a marker for therapies in breast cancer.",M2

METHODS: Experiment was carried out in tumor-bearing mice after inoculation of EL-4 cells. The mice were randomly divided into four groups after 7 days of the inoculation: untreated group, DBT-treated group [24 g/(kg x d)], CTX-treated group [7.5 mg/(kg x d)] and DBT plus CTX-treated group, with another ten normal mice as control. Inhibitory rate of tumor growth, survival time, immune function and variability of blood cells were measured in the mice during the experiment. RESULTS: After treatment of relevant interventions for 15 days, the tumor in the DBT-treated group, CTX-treated group and DBT plus CTX-treated group grew slower than the untreated group (P&lt;0.05). Murine survival time in the DBT-treated group, CTX-treated group and DBT plus CTX-treated group was lengthened as compared with that in the untreated group (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the untreated group, all kinds of immune indexes in the DBT-treated group and DBT plus CTX-treated group were significantly improved (P&lt;0.05), while the immune indexes in the CTX-treated group were decreased (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the CTX-treated group, all kinds of immune indexes in the DBT plus CTX-treated group were significantly improved (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DBT can enhance the immune function in tumor-bearing mice and the inhibitory effect of DBT on tumor growth is related to the enhanced immune response. DBT can also increase the therapeutic effects and reduce the side effects of CTX.",M2
18065810,"Mycophenolate mofetil versus cyclophosphamide for inducing remission of ANCA vasculitis with moderate renal involvement.OBJECTIVE: We performed a single-centre non-blinded clinical trial to compare the clinical efficacies of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and intermittent cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) pulse therapy as induction treatments in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis (AAV) and moderate renal involvement. METHODS: Patients with active AAV and serum creatinine &lt;500 micromol/L received either MMF treatment (MMF group) or monthly CTX pulse therapy (CTX group) for 6 months. Disease activity was assessed using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS). The disease activity, remission rate, renal function and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (15 male, 20 female: aged 49.1 +/- 12.2 years) were enrolled, with 18 in the MMF group and 17 in the CTX group. Of the 35 patients, 28 were MPO-ANCA positive and 2 were PR3-ANCA positive. Four patients were lost to follow-up in the CTX group. At Month 6, BVAS scores were much lower in the MMF group than in the CTX group (0.2 +/- 0.89 versus 2.6 +/- 1.7, P &lt; 0.05). In the intent-to-treatment analysis, 14 of 18 patients (77.8%) treated with MMF and 8 of 17 patients receiving CTX (47.1%) had complete remission with an absolute difference of 30.7%. Eight of 18 patients (44.4%) in the MMF group and 2 of 17 patients (15.4%) in the CTX group recovered renal function. Serum ANCA decreased to normal in 41.7% of patients in the MMF group and in 16.7% in the CTX group. Side effects in the MMF group were pneumonia (1), herpes zoster (1) and gastrointestinal symptoms (2), and in the CTX group were leukocytopenia (1), gastrointestinal distress (4) and pneumonia (1). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that MMF effectively ameliorates disease activity and considerably improves renal function in patients with AAV. Further large-scale multicentre prospective randomized controlled trials will be needed to confirm these findings.",M2

METHODS: Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley female rats were divided randomly into six groups, which received normal saline (NS), CTX, GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + CTX, GnRH-ant + NS, and GnRH-ant + CTX respectively. Levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E(2)) were measured successively by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and half of the rats were killed in the first week and between the fourth and the fifth week after stop of medication, respectively to compare the weight of the ovaries and the number of the primordial follicles and the growth follicles. RESULTS: (1) Throughout experiment, the serum levels of FSH, LH and E(2) of the control group fluctuated slightly, while those in the CTX group kept rising. During medication treatment, compared with the control group [(118 +/- 16) microg/L, (350 +/- 35) microg/L] and the CTX group [(113 +/- 15) microg/L, (289 +/- 42) microg/L], the concentrations of LH [(42 +/- 8) - (47 +/- 7) microg/L, (31 +/- 5) - (36 +/- 7) microg/L] and FSH [(124 +/- 45) - (136 +/- 32) microg/L, (178 +/- 54) - (198 +/- 27) microg/L] in the GnRH-a groups and the GnRH-ant groups were maintained at low levels significantly and the levels of LH in the GnRH-ant groups were significantly lower than that in the GnRH-a groups, but the levels of FSH in the GnRH-ant groups were significantly higher than that in the GnRH-a groups (P &lt; 0.05); and extremely different from the GnRH-a groups [(0.98 +/- 0.18) - (1.46 +/- 0.22) ng/L], the level of E(2) of the GnRH-ant groups [(3.58 +/- 0.43) - (3.98 +/- 0.74) ng/L] did not significantly decrease (P &lt; 0.01). After stop of therapy, the concentrations of LH, FSH and E(2) in the GnRH-a groups and the GnRH-ant + NS group rose gradually and were similar to the levels of the control group (P &gt; 0.05), but the levels of FSH, LH and E(2) of the GnRH-ant + CTX group rose obviously and were similar to the levels of the CTX group, especially the FSH , and the levels of LH and FSH of the GnRH-ant + CTX group [(156 +/- 12) microg/L, (520 +/- 44) microg/L] and the CTX group [(178 +/- 18) microg/L, (546 +/- 36) microg/L] were significantly higher than that of the other four groups [(121 +/- 15) - (132 +/- 13) microg/L, (335 +/- 35) - (359 +/- 26) microg/L] at the 4(th) - 5(th) week after stop of treatment (P &lt; 0.05). (2) At the 1(st) week after stopping therapy, the GnRH-a + NS group [(12 +/- 5) mg/100 g]and the GnRH-a + CTX group [(18 +/- 8) mg/100 g] had the lowest weight of ovaries which was significantly different from the other groups [(30 +/- 9) - (37 +/- 8) mg/100 g, P &lt; 0.05]. At the 4(th) - 5(th) week after stopping therapy, the GnRH-ant + CTX group [(22 +/- 6) mg/100 g] and the CTX group [(20 +/- 4) mg/100 g] had the lowest weight of ovaries which were significantly different from the other groups [(29 +/- 5) - (31 +/- 9) mg/100 g, P &lt; 0.05]. (3) At the 1(st) week after stopping therapy, there were the largest number of primordial follicles [(824 +/- 45), (689 +/- 39)] and the lowest number of growth follicles [(15 +/- 1), (21 +/- 3)] in the GnRH-a + NS group and the GnRH-a + CTX group, but there were the lowest number of primordial follicles [(255 +/- 24), (343 +/- 29)] and the largest number of growth follicles [(110 +/- 21), (87 +/- 17)] in the GnRH-ant + CTX group and the CTX group. At the 4(th) - 5(th) week after stopping therapy, the number of growth follicles in the GnRH-a + NS group (58 +/- 11) and the GnRH-a + CTX group (56 +/- 16) recovered to almost the level of the control group (57 +/- 9, P &gt; 0.05), but the number of all kinds of follicles declined significantly in the GnRH-ant + CTX group [(195 +/- 15), (36 +/- 12)] and the CTX group [(212 +/- 11), (36 +/- 9)] compared to the other four groups [(302 +/- 15) - (690 +/- 43), (44 +/- 12) - (58 +/- 11), P &lt; 0.05]. CONCLUSION: In rat model, GnRH-a prevents the ovarian function damage induced by CTX, but GnRH-ant does not show similar protective effect.",M2

METHODS: The clinical data of 108 patients with adenocarcinoma Barrett's esophagus picking out from 783 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients surgically treated between June 1978 to June 2001 in the Shandong Provincial Hospital and Shandong Qianfoshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. 60Co gamma-irradiation or 6MVX-ray with conventional fraction were used for radiotherapy with a total volume dosage of 55-70 Gy. The chemotherapy was either FAM (iv infusion of 5-Fu 500 mg, d1-d5; ADM 50 mg d1; MMC 12 mg, d1) or CMF regimen (iv infusion of <e>CTX</e> 800 mg d1, d8; MTX 30 mg d1; 5-Fu 500 mg, d1-d5) for 4-6 cycles. The Kaplan-Meier amalysis was used to estimate the survival rate. Log rank test was used for comparison of the survival difference among different groups. RESULTS: In this series, 76 of 92 patients who underwent radical surgical resection received postoperative radiotherapy alone, and 16 received radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Twelve of the other 16 patients who underwent palliative surgical resection received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, the remaining 4 patients died of operative complications during surgery. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of this series was 81.5%, 51.9% and 22.2%, respectively. In the radical resection group, it was 15.8% for the patients received radiotherapy alone versus 75.0% for those treated by chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. The 5-year survival rate was 33.3% for the patients without extra-esophageal infiltration and 33.3% for the patients without lymph node metastasis, respectively. However, it was only 9.1% for the patients with extra-esophageal infiltration and 14.3% for those with lymph node metastasis, respectively. For the patients who had palliative surgical resection, though they received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy postoperatively, none of them survived longer than 5-year. Statistically significant difference among these groups was demonstrated by Log rank test (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy after radical surgical resection may improve the survival of patients with adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus adenocarcinoma patient. The pathological stage, extra-esophageal infiltration, lymph node metastasis and postoperative chemotherapy plus radiotherapy are important prognostic factors.",M2

METHODS: The immunity-deficiency model was induced by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) at the dose of 100 mg/ kg in mice which were randomly divided into normal control group, immunity-deficiency model group, SKC treated group (250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg) and positive control group (500 mg/kg). The number of WBC in peripheral blood, the weight of immune organs, the phagocytosis activity of macrophage, the content of serum hemolysin and the proliferation of T lymphocyte in the spleen were measured. RESULTS: The number of WBC, the weight of immune organs, the phagocytosis activity of macrophage, the content of serum hemolysin and the proliferation of T lymphocyte in the model group were all decreased compared with those of normal control group. After the administration of SKC, the index mentioned above was increased compared with those of model group. CONCLUSION: SKC has a protective effect on the immunity-deficiency mice, which may be related to the increasing of cellular immunity, humoral immunity and nonspecific immunity.",M2
17917963,"Intermediate dose etoposide plus G-CSF 16 g/kg is more effective than cyclophosphamide 4 g/m(2) plus G-CSF 10 g/kg in PBSC mobilization of lymphoma patients.We designed intermediate dose etoposide + G-CSF 16 microg/kg as a Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) mobilization schedule suitable for outpatient administration. Forty-one Lymphoma patients received intermediate dose etoposide (200 mg/m(2) i.v. day +1, +2, +3) +G-CSF 16 microg/kg/day. Results of PBSC mobilization in these patients were compared with those of a group of 37 lymphoma patients mobilized using cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) at dosage of 4 g/m(2) + G-CSF 10 microg/kg/die. Mean peak of CD34+ cells achieved in P.B. and total CD34+ cells harvested were higher in patients mobilized with intermediate dose etoposide (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). After transplantation recovery of polymorphonucleate neutrophils (PMN) &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L did not differ significantly between groups: 11.7 days in intermediate dose etoposide group and 11.5 days in CTX group (p = 0.7). Intermediate dose etoposide + G-CSF 16 microg/kg resulted in a maximum length of neutropenia (PMN &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L) of 2 days and neutropenic fever was registered during only 3/41 courses (7.3%). Intermediate dose etoposide + G-CSF 16 microg/kg is a highly effective mobilizing therapy, further, it has the advantage of low hematologic toxicity and can be easily administered as outpatient treatment.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with CDDP-resistant/refractory and paclitaxel pretreated patients were treated with 8 cycles of GEM 800 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 and LDOX 30 mg/m2 day 1, alternating with CDDP 60 mg/m2 and CTX 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Objective responses were observed in 37.5% of patients (4 complete and 11 partial responses) with measurable disease (n=40). CA125 response occurred in 30 (71.4%) of patients with elevated CA125 (n=42). After a median follow-up of 23 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval, CI: 5.2-8.5), while the median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months (95% CI: 12.7-23.6). A progression-free interval (PFI) of 0-3 months was associated with lower objective responses (10% versus 46.6%, p=0.06). Chemotherapy was well tolerated. The most frequent toxicities were myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, nausea/vomiting, fatigue and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). Overall 31 (65%) patients received G-CSF and 13 (27%) antibiotics because of neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia.

17898787,"Bortezomib is synergistic with rituximab and cyclophosphamide in inducing apoptosis of mantle cell lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo.Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with poor clinical outcome. Although front therapy induces a high rate of complete remission (CR), relapse is inevitable and new regimens are much needed for relapsed MCL. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) induces apoptosis and sensitizes MCL cells to chemotherapy in relapsed MCL, but CR rates are low, with a short duration of response and severe toxicity. Here we evaluated whether BTZ is additive or synergistic with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and rituximab (RTX). Increasing doses of BTZ with a fixed dose of RTX and CTX (BRC regimen) resulted in markedly synergistic growth inhibition of MCL cells. BRC significantly enhanced apoptosis in MCL cell lines and primary tumor cells compared with single-agent treatment. Furthermore, western blotting analysis indicated that BRC induces apoptosis earlier via activation and cleavage of caspases-8, -9 and -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, than single-agent treatment. The pan-caspase inhibitor completely blocked apoptosis induced by BRC. In vivo studies showed that BRC eradicated subcutaneous tumors in MCL-bearing SCID mice and significantly prolonged the long-term event-free survival in 70% of the mice. Hence, our study demonstrates that cytoreductive chemotherapy with both BTZ and anti-CD20 antibody may offer a better therapeutic modality for relapsed MCL.",M2
17895357,"Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation without CD34+ cell selection in refractory Crohn's disease.OBJECTIVES: Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with CD34(+) cell selection has recently been used in the treatment of refractory Crohn's disease, showing good safety and promising efficacy. We investigated the safety and efficacy of HSCT with unselected peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) in moderate-severe refractory Crohn's disease. PATIENTS: Four patients (three male, one female; age range 26-45 years) with active moderate-severe Crohn's disease (median Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 319, range 272-345), refractory or intolerant to multiple drugs including infliximab, were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Unselected PBSCs were collected after mobilisation with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) 1.5 g/m2 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10 microg/kg. The conditioning regimen included CTX 50 mg/kg on days -5 to -2 and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/kg on days -4 to -2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints were toxicity and clinical remission (CDAI&lt;150) at 3 months. Secondary endpoints were clinical and endoscopic response at 3 months and toxicity, clinical and endoscopic remission at 12 months. RESULTS: No improvement or slight deterioration was observed following mobilisation (median CDAI 339, range 258-404). At the third month, the primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved in all patients, with a median CDAI of 91 (range 56-102), and complete endoscopic remission was achieved in 2/3 patients. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, 3/4 patients maintained both clinical and endoscopic remission, despite withdrawal of all drugs, and complete fistula closure was observed in all affected patients. No deaths or life-threatening infection occurred. Unexpected adverse events included a perianal abscess after mobilisation in one patient, pleural and pericardial effusions in another and BK virus-related macrohaematuria in another, all rapidly resolved with conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: Autologous HSCT with unselected PBSC appears to be safe and can induce and maintain remission in previously refractory Crohn's disease patients.",M2
17591836,"Liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer: a phase II multicentric study.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (TLC D-99) plus cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in light of the potential cardioprotective effect of TLC D-99 as compared with conventional doxorubicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients as defined according Simon's two-stage phase II design were enrolled. They received TLC D-99 at the dosage of 60 mg/m2 plus CTX 600 mg/m2, with cycles repeated every 3 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by ultrasonography at baseline and every two cycles. RESULTS: The principal characteristics of the 67 enrolled patients were as follows: median age 60 years (range 33-75), median World Health Organization performance status of 1 (range 0-2) and dominant disease site (viscera/bone/soft tissue): 47/15/15 There were nine complete responses and 32 partial responses for an overall response rate of 64%; a further 14 patients had stable disease and the remaining nine patients progressed. Median number of administered cycles was six. Median duration of response was 10 and 9 months, respectively, for complete responders and partial responders. Median duration of survival was 17+ months (range 3 to 33+). Hematological toxicity consisted in leucopenia (G1-G2) in 21 patients and anemia (G1-G2) in 20 patients; G1 thrombocytopenia was observed only in 2 patients. Non-hematological toxicity was generally mild with G1-G2 nausea/vomiting in 23 patients and G1-G2 mucositis in 10. Hair loss was registered in 30 patients and it was G2 in 14 patients. As to concern cardiac toxicity, one patient developed an asymptomatic 20% decline of left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value.

17870094,"Intravenous mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide as second-line therapy in multiple sclerosis: an open-label comparative study of efficacy and safety.The study's aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and mitoxantrone (MITO) as second-line therapy in a clinical sample of active relapsing-remitting (RR) or secondary-progressive (SP) multiple sclerosis subjects. MITO was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/m(2) monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months, until a dosage of 120 mg/m(2) was reached. CTX was administered at a dosage of 700 mg/m(2) monthly for 12 months, then bimonthly for another 24 months. We used the Kaplan-Meier curves to assess time to the first relapse in RR and SP patients with relapses, and time to progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in all the patients. MRI was assessed at baseline and after 12 months. Moreover, side effects were recorded. Seventy-five patients received MITO (31 RR, 44 SP) and 78 CTX (15 RR, 63 SP). The two groups differ only in terms of a significantly higher proportion of RR patients in the MITO group. After a mean follow-up of 3.6 years there was no significant difference in terms of time to the first relapse (MITO 2.6 years, CTX 2.5 years; p=0.50), whereas time to disease progression was slightly shorter in MITO than in CTX group (MITO 3.8 years, CTX 3.6 years; p=0.04). After 12 months of treatment, active MRI scans were reduced by 69% in MITO and 63% in CTX patients (p=0.10). Discontinuation due to side effects was more frequent in CTX patients. However, the overall tolerability profile was acceptable in both groups.",M2
17728363,"Induction therapies for class IV lupus nephritis with non-inflammatory necrotizing vasculopathy: mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous cyclophosphamide.The presence of renal noninflammatory necrotizing vasculopathy (NNV) is often associated with a severe form of lupus nephritis (LN), which is unresponsive to standard therapy. We conducted a 6-month randomized, prospective, open-label trial comparing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1.5-2.0 g/day) with monthly i.v. cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) (0.75-1.0 g/m2) as induction therapy for class IV LN with NNV. The primary and second end points were complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), respectively. Of 20 patients recruited, nine were randomly assigned to MMF and 11 to CTX. The baseline characteristics between groups were not significant. CR was achieved in four patients (44.4%) receiving MMF and in none of the patients receiving CTX (P = 0.026). PR was achieved in two patients (22.2%) in the MMF group and three patients (27.2%) in the CTX group. The total remission rate (CR + PR) in the MMF and CTX group was 66.6 and 27.2%, respectively (P = 0.17). MMF was more effective than i.v. CTX in reducing proteinuria and haematuria.

DC extract against cyclophosphamide induced toxicity in Swiss albino mice.An alcoholic extract of Biophytum sensitivum was studied against cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) induced toxicity in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of the extract with CTX significantly increased the total WBC count (3,356 +/- 236 cells/cm2), bone marrow cellularity (15.6 +/- 0.42 cells/femur) and alpha-esterase positive cells (846 +/- 30 cells) when compared to control mice treated with CTX alone. The relative organ weight of the spleen and thymus was also found to be increased after B. sensitivum administration when compared to the control mice. Reduction of GSH in liver (4.9 +/- 0.22 nmol/mg protein) and in intestinal mucosa (10.6 +/- 1.02 nmol/mg protein) of CTX treated controls was significantly reversed by B. sensitivum administration (liver: 6.5 +/- 0.18 nmol/mg protein; intestinal mucosa: 16.5 +/- 0.88 nmol/mg protein), with amelioration of changes in serum and liver ALP, GPT and lipid peroxidation. Histopathological analysis of the small intestine also suggests that B. sensitivum could reduce CTX induced intestinal damage. The level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, which was elevated during CTX administration, was significantly reduced by the administration of B. sensitivum extract. The lowered levels of cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-2 and GM-CSF after CTX treatment were also found to be increased by B. sensitivum extract administration.",M2

METHODS: Nineteen patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the treated group (10 cases) received combined therapy of prednisone and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) plus Chinese medicine Langchuang Recipe after being treated impactively with gamma-globulin. The control group (9 cases) was treated with prednisone and CTX. Changes of hypoplastic bone marrow, peripheral white blood cell (WBC), complement C3, 24 h urinary protein excretion, and lupus activity index (LAI) were observed, and a follow-up was carried out for one year. RESULTS: After one-month treatment, the bone marrow hypoplasia was relieved significantly in the treated group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), showing an improvement superior to that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01); after three months treatment, the level of complement C3 increased (P &lt; 0.01), while the 24 h urinary protein excretion and LAI decreased in the treated group (P &lt; 0.05), showing significant difference as compared with those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). In the follow-up period, 3 cases withdrew from the trial because of infection and 4 cases manifested full moon-face and acne in the control group, while no adverse reaction was found in the treated group.

17551502,"Chemotherapy enhances CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity induced by vaccination with vaccinia virus.The use of immunotherapy or chemotherapy alone is generally ineffective against well-established tumors. To overcome this intrinsic resistance against therapy for tumors, we have attempted to combine immunotherapy with chemotherapy. In this study, we tried to induce a rapid antitumor effect via chemoimmunotherapy using a vaccinia viral vaccine as an immunotherapeutic agent with anticancer agents including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and conventional anticancer drugs. Although a combination of vaccinia-mediated vaccination and chemotherapy led to a strong inhibition of tumor growth, monotherapy alone failed to completely cure tumors. In contrast, intravenous injection of cisplatin (CDDP) or cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) after vaccinia virus vaccination led to complete regression of the established tumors. Interestingly, anticancer drugs appear to augment the antitumor effect of the vaccinia virus-mediated immunotherapy. This effect is mainly associated with the enhanced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell immune response induced by vaccinia virus, which was demonstrated by antibody depletion. However, anticancer drugs alone failed to induce a significant enhancement of the tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell immune response. Taken together, these results suggest that combining vaccinia virus-based immunotherapy with anticancer drugs is particularly effective against established tumors by increasing the tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell immune response, which is primed by vaccinia virus-mediated vaccination.",M2
17548941,"Low dose radiation increased the therapeutic efficacy of cyclophosphamide on S(180) sarcoma bearing mice.We examined whether low dose radiation (LDR) exposure (75 mGy) could increase the therapeutic efficacy of cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) by comparing the effects of tumor suppression, tumor cell apoptosis, cell cycle and proliferation of bone marrow in vivo. Kunming mice implanted with S(180) sarcoma cells were given 75 mGy whole body gamma-ray radiation exposure and CTX (300 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection 36 hours after LDR. Proliferation of bone marrow and tumor cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytochrome c leakage from the tumor was measured by Western-blot. We discovered that tumor growth was significantly reduced in the group exposed to CTX add to LDR. The apoptosis of tumor cells increased significantly after LDR. The tumor cells were arrested in G(1) phase in the groups treated with CTX and CTX + LDR, but cell cycle was more significantly arrested in mice exposed to LDR followed by CTX than in mice exposed only to LDR or CTX chemotherapy. Concentration of bone marrow cells and proliferation index in CTX + LDR mice were higher than those in the untreated mice. LDR or CTX + LDR could induce greater cytochrome c levels and caspase-3 activity in tumors. These results suggest that low dose radiation can enhance the anti-tumor effect of the chemotherapy agent CTX markedly. Furthermore, LDR significantly protects hematopoetic function of the bone marrow, which is of practical significance on adjuvant chemotherapy.",M2

METHODS: Forty-three patients diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by kidney damage and qi-deficiency syndrome were randomly divided into trial group (n=23) and control group (n=20). Patients in both groups were treated for 3 months. Intravenous drip infusion of 0.8 g CTX was administered to all patients once a month, while intravenous drip infusion of 20 ml Astragalus injection was only administered to patients in the trial group every day for 12 days in each month. RESULTS: The decrease of active clinical symptom score after the treatment in the trial group was greater than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). The infection rates of the trial group and the control group were 4.35% and 25% respectively. The decrease of 24-hour urine protein and CD8, and the increase of red blood cell count and serum albumin in the trial group were greater than those in the control group, and there were significant differences between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). White blood cell count in the trial group was decreased less than that in the control group after the treatment (P&lt;0.05).

17442207,"Inhibitory effect of ginsenoside Rg3 combined with cyclophosphamide on growth and angiogenesis of ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside Rg3, the main component isolated from ginseng, inhibits some kinds of tumour growth and angiogenesis. The combination of low dose chemotherapy and antiangiogenesis inhibitors suppresses growth of experimental tumours more effectively than conventional therapy. The effect of this combination on ovarian cancer remains to be evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the synergism of ginsenoside Rg3 and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) on growth and angiogenesis of human ovarian cancer. METHODS: Twenty-eight female athymic mice were divided randomly into 4 groups of 7: ginsenoside Rg3, CTX, ginsenoside Rg3 and CTX combination and control, after being transplanted with ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3). The mice were given intraperitoneal injection of ginsenoside Rg3 and CTX for the 10 days following inoculation of SKOV-3 cells. The life quality and number of living days of mice were recorded. The size of tumour, tumour inhibitive rate, life elongation rate, proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index (PCNALI), expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) of the tumour tissues were estimated. RESULTS: Life quality of mice in ginsenoside Rg3 and combined treatment groups were better and number of living days longer than control. Average tumour weights of each treated group were less than control and there was no significant difference among the treated groups. PCNALI of treated groups was lower than control. The MVD value and VEGF expression in treated groups were significantly lower than control and the MVD values of ginsenoside Rg3 and combined treatment groups were lower than that of CTX group. CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenoside Rg3 significantly inhibited growth and angiogenesis of ovarian cancer when used alone or combined with CTX. Ginsenoside Rg3 and CTX combination reinforced the antitumour effect each other and improved the living quality and survival time of mice with tumour.",M2
17440723,"Single administration of low dose cyclophosphamide augments the antitumor effect of dendritic cell vaccine.Single administration of low dose cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) was previously reported to enhance the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapies. To investigate the possible mechanisms for this effect, we examined whether a single administration of low dose CTX could augment the immunogenicity of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines. Fifty milligrams per kilogram body weight dose of CTX was administrated intraperitoneally to mice after B16 melanoma or C26 colon carcinoma tumor models were established, DC vaccine generated from mouse bone marrow and pulsed with B16 or C26 tumor cells lysates were vaccinated 4 days later. CTX treatment potentiated the antitumor effects of the DC vaccine, and increased the proportion of IFN-gamma secreting lymphocytes in spleens. Furthermore, a significantly reduced proportion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells was detected by flow cytometry in spleen lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice treated with CTX. Thus, a single administration of low dose CTX could augment antitumor immune responses of DC vaccine by reducing the proportion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells in tumor-bearing mice. Our results suggested a possible mechanism of CTX-induced immunopotentiation and provided a strategy of immunotherapy combining a low dose CTX with DC vaccine.",M2

CASE PRESENTATION: We tried palliative chemotherapy with daily low dose oral cyclophosphamide with a patient suffering from stage IIIC ovarian cancer that responded to daily cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) after no response to chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first line and progression after second line with topotecan. The progression-free survival time on daily low dose oral cyclophosphamide treatment was 65 months without side effects. She was well during the chemotherapy and lived a normal working and social life. CONCLUSION: We think that use of low dose of oral CTX should be investigated further as a strategy against tumour progression after standard chemotherapy in patients who are platinum resistant with poor performance status.",M2
17430667,"[Clinical comparison of GC regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin) versus FEC regimen (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plays a crucial role in treating breast cancer, but there is no standard regimen. Recently, FEC regimen [5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin (EPI), plus cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)] is the most commonly used; gemcitabine (GEM) is also a new active antimetabolite for breast cancer, however, the experience with neoadjuvant gemcitabine is limited. This study was to compare the efficacy of GC regimen and FEC regimen on breast cancer, and observe the adverse events. METHODS: From Mar. 2003 to Sep. 2005, 62 patients with stage II-III breast cancer were treated with 2 cycles of either GC regimen or FEC regimen before operation. The 22 patients in GC group received GEM (1000 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and DDP (75 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 2. The 40 patients in FEC group received EPI (50 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1, CTX (500 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and 5-FU (500 mg/m(2)) by 4-hour continuous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8. Clinical response and adverse events were assessed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate (RR) was 63.6% in GC group and 72.5% in FEC group. After GC therapy, 4 patients showed clinical complete remission (cCR), 2 pathologic complete remission (pCR), 10 partial remission (PR), 8 stable disease (SD)û while after FEC therapy, 9 patients showed cCR, 5 pCR, 20 PR, 10 SD. The most common adverse events were anemia, leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. More cases of leukopenia were observed in GC group (18/22, P&lt;0.05), and more cases of anemia in FEC group (29/40, P&lt;0.05); the occurrence rates of gastroenteric reaction were similar in both groups. Only 1 patient in GC group suffered from oral mucositis; no renal toxicity and neurotoxicity were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GC and FEC regimens are both effective for breast cancer with tolerable adverse events. The efficacy of FEC regimen is better than that of GT regimen.",M2
17430657,"[Predictive value of in vitro MTT assay chemosensitivity test of cytotoxic drug activity in cervical cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cervical cancer has evoked more and more attention and has been used widely. But the chemosensitivity of individuals to various antitumor drugs is different. This study was to investigate the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to antitumor drugs using in vitro MTT assay chemosensitivity test. METHODS: The sensitivity of fresh human cervical cancer cells from 32 patients to 9 cytotoxic drugs was tested using in vitro MTT assay. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activities of the 9 drugs for cervical cancer were in sequence from high to low as follows: liposomal paclitaxel, taxol, carboplatin (CBP), ifosfamide (IFO), etoposide (VP-16), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (DDP), bleomycin (BLM), and cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>). Generally, cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel, taxol, and CBP than to other drugs (P&lt;0.05) with inhibition rates of 56.56%, 55.66%, and 46.81%, respectively. Stage Ib1 cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to taxol, paclitaxel, and CBP than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 58.71%, 53.00%, and 49.25%, respectively; stage Ib2 cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel and taxol than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 65.26% and 50.06%. Both moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell cancer cells were more sensitive to taxol, paclitaxel, and CBP than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 52.01%, 49.21%, and 40.02% for the former, and 60.02%, 61.16%, and 48.75% for the latter. CONCLUSIONS: MTT assay, a sensitive and widely used chemosensitivity testing method, is helpful in sensitive drug screening and neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen selection for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer cells are more sensitive to paclitaxel, taxol, and CBP than to other tested drugs in this study.",M2
17416014,"[Assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients]OBJECTIVE: To assess the response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its influencing factors in the breast cancer patients. METHODS: 171 patients with stage II or operable stage III breast cancers were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery between January 2004 and May 2005. Of these, 160 received and completed &gt; or =3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 11 received only 2 cycles. The regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were: CEF (<e>CTX</e>, Epirubicin, 5-Fu); NE (Navelbine, Epirubicin); TEC (Taxotere, Epirubicin, CTX). Response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated in all patients by palpation, ultrasonography and pathological methods. RESULTS: Complete response rate and clinical objective response rate determined by clinical palpation (cCR, cOR), ultrasonography (sCR, sOR) and pathology (pCR) was 18.7% and 88.3%; 4.1% and 74.9%; 15.2%, respectively. The correspondence rate of the pCR with cCR and sCR was 43.8% and 42.9%, respectively. It was showed by univariate analysis that patient whose tumor was &lt; or =3 cm in diameter, or ER negative or grade 3 were more likely to achieve a pCR than those whose tumor was &gt;3 cm, or ER positive or grade 1. Logistic regression analysis showed that only tumor size was the significant predictive factor for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Patient with small, or ER negative or grade 3 tumor may have better pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly, the tumor size is more predictive of pCR. Palpation or ultrasonography may have a tendency either to under- or to overestimate pCR. Breast neoplasms/drug therapy;",M2
17397027,"Tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium improves cyclophosphamide chemotherapy at maximum tolerated dose and low-dose metronomic regimens in a murine melanoma model.Chemotherapy for cancer is partly limited by the inability of drugs to act on poorly vascularized or avascularized areas of tumors. Tumor-targeting bacteria are capable of preferentially replicating in these poorly perfused regions. Some strains have been combined with chemotherapeutic agents and the results have been promising. However, no systematic work has been carried out to test the effect of bacteria on clinical modes of chemotherapy, such as standard maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and novel low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy. Here Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 was combined with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) at both MTD and LDM schedules in a murine melanoma model. The results showed that VNP20009 significantly improved the effects of all forms of CTX treatments. The combination of VNP20009 and CTX led to a more significant decrease in tumor microvessel density and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level, compared with either treatment alone. Furthermore, combination therapy remarkably increased the number of bacteria within tumors when compared with bacteria treatment alone. These findings suggest that tumor-targeting bacteria, in conjunction with CTX at standard MTD and LDM regimens, might be of clinical value for the treatment of melanoma.",M2
17365016,"Effect of AC II, an herbal formulation in cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in BALB/c mice--Implication in HIV treatment.Effect of AC II, herbal drug formulation in reducing immunosuppression caused by administration of cyclophosphamide was studied. Mice were injected cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) 50 mg/kg b.wt. for 14 days with or without the drug and total WBC, bone marrow cellularity and alpha-esterase positive cells were determined. On day 15, total WBC count in cyclophosphamide treated mice was 1500 +/- 420 cells/mm3, while in AC II-treated mice it was 7658 +/- 376 cells/mm3. On day 16, administration of cyclophosphamide reduced bone marrow cellularity to 3.42 +/- 0.38 x 10(6) cells/femur from the normal value of 13.83 +/- 0.96 x 10(6) cells/femur. In AC II treated group bone marrow cellularity was increased to 8.05 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) cells/femur. The number of alpha-esterase positive cells was found to be reduced to 177 +/- 25 cells per 4000 cells in CTX treated groups. But in AC II-treated group the number of alpha-esterase positive cells were raised to 843 +/- 86 cells per 4000 cells, which was closer to that of normal (710 +/- 49 cells per 4000 cells). Results indicate the usefulness of AC II to combat immunosuppression induced by chemical and biological agents.",M2
17250437,"Ameliorating effects of Andrographis paniculata extract against cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity in mice.Major drawbacks of chemotherapeutic agents are their toxic side effects and lack of tumor specificity. Immunological and biochemical studies were here carried out to investigate protective effects of ethanolic extract of Andrographis paniculata against cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) induced toxicity in vivo. Intraperitoneal administration of the extract significantly increased the total WBC account (3256.5+/-196 cells/cm(2)), bone marrow cellularity (17.1+/-10.4x10(6) cells/femur) and betaesterase positive cells (849+/-23.2 cells/4000 cells) in CTX treated animals, when compared to CTX alone treated control mice. Weights of lymphoid organs such as a spleen and thymus, reduced by CTX administration, were also increased by A paniculata treatment. Reduction of GSH in liver (4.8+/-0.21nmol/mg protein) and in intestinal mucosa (13+/-0.67 nmol/mg protein) of CTX-treated controls was significantly reversed by A paniculata administration (liver: 6.4+/-0.13, intestinal mucosa: 17.11+/-0.06), with amelioration of changes in serum and liver ALP, GPT, LPO (lipid peroxidation). Histopathological analysis of small intestine also suggests that extract could reduce the CTX induced intestinal damage. The level of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, which was elevated during CTX administration, was significantly reduced by the A paniculata extract administration. The lowered levels of other cytokines like IFN-gamma, IL-2, GM-CSF, after CTX treatment were also found to be increased by extract administration.",M2
17204170,"Effect of ginseng saponin, arsenic trioxide, beta-elemene combined with <e>CTX</e> on telomere-telomerase system in K562 cell line.This study was aimed to investigate the modulating effects on telomere length and telomerase activity in K562 cells treated by arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, beta-elemene alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide (CTX) and to explore the possible mechanism and new therapy for acute leukemia. Human erythroleukemic cell line K562 was co-cultured with the above-mentioned drugs. Cells were collected after 24, 48 and 72 hours for further detection. Telomere length and telomerase activity were detected by Southern-blot and PCR-ELISA respectively. The effects of these drugs were observed at different concentrations and exposure time. The results showed that (1) ginseng saponin, arsenic trioxide, beta-elemene, or CTX could completely inhibit the telomerase activity of K562 cells at proper concentrations and exposure time. The inhibiting effects were enhanced when the three former drugs were used with CTX. Telomerase activity decreased proportionally with the concentrations and length of time. (2) viability of K562 cells was decreased after being co-cultured with arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, beta-elemene and CTX. The level of inhibition depends on the concentration and exposure time. (3) telomere length of K562 cells was 5.36 +/- 0.18 kb. After being co-cultured with those drugs for 72 hours, telomere length was 5.90 kb -6.50 kb, significantly longer than that of control (5.18 - 5.35 kb). It is concluded that arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, and beta-elemene can inhibit the growth and telomerase activity of K562 cells. The inhibiting effects were enhanced when they were used in combination with CTX. The depression of telomerase activity may be one of the mechanisms of anti-tumor effect. Less dosage and shorter course can be expected when arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, and beta-elemene are used in combination with CTX. When telomerase activity was depressed, the telomere length prolonged a little, indicating K562 cell line may extend telomeres by some alternative way other than telomerase activation.",M2
17198082,"Defining the ability of cyclophosphamide preconditioning to enhance the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response to peptide vaccination: creation of a beneficial host microenvironment involving type I IFNs and myeloid cells.Although cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) has been clearly shown to enhance active specific and adoptive immunotherapies, the mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects have not been clearly defined. To define the impact of CTX preconditioning on the antigen-specific CD8 T-cell response to peptide vaccination, we used an adoptive transfer model based on the OT-1 T-cell receptor transgenic mouse. CTX preconditioning dramatically enhanced the antigen-specific CD8 T-cell response to peptide vaccination. Specifically, CTX significantly enhanced the expansion and function of responding CD8 T cells as demonstrated by flow cytometry and cytokine production. In parallel experiments, we attempted to define the mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects of CTX therapy. CTX therapy increased the relative number and activation status of myeloid dendritic cells, and was associated with the induction of significant levels of the inflammatory cytokines interferon-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IL-6. Adoptive transfer experiments into type I IFNR-/- and CR3-/- mice confirmed that the beneficial effects of CTX were at least partially dependent on type I interferons and myeloid cells. Adoptive transfer of up to 150x10(6) naive spleen cells at the time of antigen-specific CD8 T-cell transfer did not abrogate the effects of CTX therapy, suggesting that the creation of a niche in the immune system may not be required. CTX decreased the absolute, but not relative number of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, consistent with the possibility that regulatory T cells may be targeted by CTX therapy. Of note, combination therapy with CTX and a synthetic TLR3 agonist further enhanced the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response. Taken together, our data suggest that CTX modulates specific components of the innate immune system resulting in a beneficial host microenvironment. Specific targeting of these components may enhance the effectiveness of CTX preconditioning for adoptive immunotherapy.",M2
17156807,"Cyclophosphamide as a potent inhibitor of tumor thioredoxin reductase in vivo.Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) is in the nitrogen mustard group of alkylating antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents. It is one of the most frequently used antitumor agents for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human cancers. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of thioredoxin and play an important role in multiple cellular events related to carcinogenesis including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. This enzyme represents a promising target for the development of cytostatic agents. The purpose of this study is to determine whether CTX could target TrxR in vivo. Lewis lung carcinoma and solid H22 hepatoma treated with 50-250 mg/kg CTX for 3 h lost TrxR activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Over 75% and 95% of TrxR activity was lost at the dose of 250 mg/kg. There was, however, a recovery of TrxR activity such that it attained normal levels by 120 h after a dose of 250 mg/kg. In addition, we found that CTX caused a preferential TrxR inhibition over other antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. We also used ascites H22 cells to investigate cancer cells response after TrxR was inhibited by CTX in vivo since CTX is needed to be activated by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. The time course and dose-dependent changes of cellular TrxR activity were similar with those in tumor tissue. CTX caused a dose-dependent cellular proliferation inhibition which was positively correlated with TrxR inhibition at 3 h. Furthermore, when 3 h CTX-treated cells with various TrxR backgrounds, harvested from ascites-bearing mice, were implanted into mice, the proliferations of these cells were again proportionally dependent on TrxR activity. The TrxR inhibition could thereby be considered as a crucial mechanism contributing to anticancer effect seen upon clinical use of CTX.",M2

16995867,"Relationship of glutathione S-transferase genotypes with side-effects of pulsed cyclophosphamide therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.AIMS: Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) is an established treatment of severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cytotoxic CTX metabolites are mainly detoxified by multiple glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). However, data are lacking on the relationship between the short-term side-effects of CTX therapy and GST genotypes. In the present study, the effects of common GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genetic mutations on the severity of myelosuppression, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and infection incidences induced by pulsed CTX therapy were evaluated in patients SLE. METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes in patients with confirmed SLE diagnosis (n = 102). GSTM1 and GSTT1 null mutations were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-multiplex procedure, whereas the GSTP1 codon 105 polymorphism (Ile--&gt;Val) was analyzed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that SLE patients carrying the genotypes with GSTP1 codon 105 mutation [GSTP1*-105I/V (heterozygote) and GSTP1*-105 V/V (homozygote)] had an increased risk of myelotoxicity when treated with pulsed high-dose CTX therapy (Odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96, 12.76); especially in patients younger than 30 years (OR 7.50, 95% CI 2.14, 26.24), or in patients treated with a total CTX dose greater than 1.0 g (OR 12.88, 95% CI 3.16, 52.57). Similarly, patients with these genotypes (GSTP1*I/V and GSTP1*V/V) also had an increased risk of GI toxicity when treated with an initial pulsed high-dose CTX regimen (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.03, 10.79). However, GSTM1 and GSTT1 null mutations did not significantly alter the risks of these short-term side-effects of pulsed high-dose CTX therapy in SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: The GSTP1 codon 105 polymorphism, but not GSTM1 or GSTT1 null mutations, significantly increased the risks of short-term side-effects of pulsed high-dose CTX therapy in SLE patients. Because of the lack of selective substrates for a GST enzyme phenotyping study, timely detection of this mutation on codon 105 may assist in optimizing pulsed high-dose CTX therapy in SLE patients.",M2
16978400,"Trastuzumab in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in patients with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.BACKGROUND: HER2/neu overexpression is linked to promotion of angiogenesis in breast cancer. We therefore tested the activity of the combination of Trastuzumab with metronomic, low dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) and methotrexate (MTX) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Between April 2002 and June 2005, twenty-two patients with metastatic breast cancer with the presence of overexpression or amplification of HER2-/neu, all pre-treated with trastuzumab plus other cytotoxics, were treated with trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every three weeks) in combination with metronomic chemotherapy (MTX 2.5 mg, bid on Day 1 and Day 4 every week) and CTX (50 mg daily) (CM). RESULTS: The 22 enrolled patients are evaluable: most had an ECOG performance status of 0 (17 pts), and all were pre-treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease; 14 had progressive disease at study entry, and 11 had progressive disease during the last trastuzumab therapy. Metastatic sites included: lung (5 pts), liver (14 pts), bone (12 pts), lymph nodes (8 pts), central nervous system (CNS) (9 pts). We observed 4 partial remission (PR) (18%, 95% CI 5-40%), 10 stable disease (SD) (46%, 95% CI 24-68%), and 8 PD (36%, CI 17-59%). The clinical benefit (RP plus RC plus SD for &gt; or = 24 weeks) in all pts and in pts with disease resistant to previous trastuzumab therapy were 46% (95% CI, 24-68%) and 27% (95% CI, 6-61%), respectively. Median time to progression was 6 months and median duration of treatment was 5 months (range, 0,7 to 18.4 months and range, 1 to 18 months, respectively). Overall clinical toxicity was generally mild. Grade &gt; or =2 reversible liver toxicity and leukopenia were reported in 5 and 3 pts, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of trastuzumab and metronomic chemotherapy is effective and minimally toxic in advanced breast cancer patients. The efficacy observed in patients with disease resistant to trastuzumab supports the need of larger trial to confirm a role of this combination to delay acquired trastuzumab resistance.",M2

Methods of matrigel basement membrane and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were employed to investigate the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) after MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with the medicated serums. RESULTS: The gene expression of VEGF was dropped in CTX-treated, TAM-treated and Liver-Smoothing Recipe-treated groups. The gene expression of TIMP-1 was up-regulated in CTX-treated, Runing Recipe-treated and Kidney-Warming Recipe-treated groups; while MMP-9 was down-regulated in these groups.

The authors report results and long-term follow-up for patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who obtained prolonged clinical benefit with CM. Prospectively collected data from two successive clinical trials were evaluated. From July 1997 to October 2003, patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with low-dose oral chemotherapy (MTX 2.5 mg, twice daily on day 1 and day 2 or 4, and CTX 50 mg daily). Patients who achieved prolonged clinical benefit for a duration of 12 months or more (complete remission, partial remission or stabilization of disease) were considered for the analysis. Median follow-up was 23 months. A total of 153 patients were enrolled and are evaluable: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 in 90 patients, two or more sites of metastatic disease in 97 patients, zero regimen for metastatic breast carcinoma in 48 patients. Among 153 patients, five demonstrated complete remission and 25 partial remission. The proportion of patients who achieved prolonged clinical benefit was 15.7% (95% confidence interval 9.9-21.4%). Median time to progression for patients with prolonged clinical benefit was 21 months (range 12-37+ months). One patient maintained complete remission 42 months after therapy discontinuation. At the multivariate analysis endocrine responsiveness and the achievement of an objective response significantly correlated with the achievement of prolonged clinical benefit. Metronomic chemotherapy can induce prolonged clinical benefit in metastatic breast cancer, supporting its role as an additional therapeutic tool in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.",M2

METHODS: In this experiment, Lewis lung carcinoma model was established in C57BIL6 mice. Forty mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, cyclophosphamide (170 mg/kg, q6d) group, paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, q7d) group, and cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel group. The growth of tumor and the sideeffect of each therapy were investigated. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 immunostaining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) image analysis was performed for semiquantification of vascular enthothelial growth factor (VEGF). RESULTS: The combined low-dose therapy with cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel was most effective for antagonizing tumor-associated angiogensis; the mice of this group had the lowest MVD and VEGF expression, compared to mice of other groups (P &lt; 0.005). The combination therapy also brought about higher antitumor rate, lower tumor volume, and lower tumor weight than did the single therapy (P &lt; 0.005). Paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, q7d) therapy had the slightest side-effects; other therapies had similar acceptable side effects. CONCLUSION: The combined use of low dose cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel has synergistic antiangiogenic effect on the mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma; the combination of these two agents is clearly more effective for inhibiting angiogenesis and growth of tumor.",M2

Pretreatment of Swiss albino mice with A paniculata extract (10 mg/dose/animal intraperitoneally [ip]) and ANDLE (500 microg/dose/animal ip) could significantly reduce CTX (1.5 nmol/kg body weight)-induced urothelial toxicity. Morphological and histopathological analysis of urinary bladder of CTX-treated mice showed severe inflammation and dark coloration, whereas A paniculata and ANDLE-treated mice showed almost normal bladder morphology. Elevation of urinary protein level (7.33 +/- 0.3 g/L) by CTX administration was reduced by A paniculata (3.78 +/- 0.4 g/L) and ANDLE treatment (4.19 +/- 0.1 g/L). Urinary urea N2 level, which was elevated after 48 hours of CTX administration (24.25 +/- 0.2 g/L) was found to be reduced by the treatment with A paniculata (14.19 +/- 0.5 g/L) and ANDLE (15.79 +/- 0.4 g/L). A decreased level of reduced glutahione (GSH) content in liver (2.81 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein) and bladder (1.20 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg protein) after CTX administration was also increased by the treatment with A paniculata (liver: 5.78 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg protein; bladder: 2.96 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg protein) and ANDLE (liver: 5.14 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg protein; bladder: 2.84 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg protein). Production of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which was elevated during CTX administration, was found to be inhibited by A paniculata and ANDLE treatment.

16830884,"Quality of life comparison between corticosteroid- and-mycofenolate mofetil and corticosteroid- and-oral cyclophosphamide in the treatment of severe lupus nephritis.There is accumulating evidence that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), when combined with corticosteroid, is an effective induction treatment for severe proliferative lupus nephritis and is associated with fewer adverse effects compared to cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>), but the quality of life (QOL) associated with these regimens as perceived by the patient has not been compared. This study included patients who had experienced both treatment regimens, for distinct episodes of diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. QOL parameters during the first six months of each treatment were assessed through SF36 and WHOQOL questionnaires. Twelve patients and 24 episodes of severe lupus nephritis were studied. CTX-treated and MMF-treated episodes showed comparable baseline characteristics and response rate, with complete remission occurring in 83.3%. MMF treatment was associated with higher numerical scores for all domains across both QOL instruments than CTX. MMF treatment was associated with significantly less fatigue, less impediment of physical and social functioning, and better psychological well being compared to CTX. When each patient served as her/his own control, most patients ascribed higher QOL domain scores to the MMF-treated episode. Seventy-five percent of patients found MMF treatment more acceptable and preferred when compared with CTX, and the complications that most concerned them included Cushingoid features, alopecia, menstrual disturbance and infections. These data showed that MMF-based induction immunosuppression for severe lupus nephritis was associated with better QOL than CTX as perceived by patients, which was most likely attributed to the reduced side-effects during MMF treatment.",M2
16827141,"Plasmid DNA-induced cytokines together with cyclophosphamide decrease size and number of melanoma lung metastases.The aim of this study was to investigate whether the local induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse lungs would increase the therapeutic effect of cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) used to treat experimental B16(F10) melanoma lung metastases. CTX shows antiangiogenic properties and inhibits the growth of metastases, albeit without numerical reduction. To destroy small metastases remaining after CTX treatment, pro-inflammatory cytokines were induced by systemically administering plasmid DNA-PEl polyplexes. The CpG sequences present in plasmid DNA are immunostimulatory, i.e. they induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. The latter has great therapeutic potential as it activates NK cells directly involved in eliminating metastatic foci. Our data indicated, for the first time, that combining cyclophosphamide delivery and local induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs with plasmid DNA resulted in reduction in the size of malignant melanoma metastases and their number in mouse lungs. Both effects appeared to contribute to a significant extension of survival.",M2
16822541,"Preparation of a chemically sulfated polysaccharide derived from Grifola frondosa and its potential biological activities.This report describes the preparation, characterization and potential biological activities of a chemically sulfated polysaccharide (S-GAP-P), which was derived from water-insoluble polysaccharide of Grifola frondosa mycelia. S-GAP-P was determined to be a glucan sulfate with the average molecular weight of 28 kDa and the sulfur content of 16.4%. The antitumor and immunomodulating activities of the sulfated derivative were estimated in vitro and in vivo. S-GAP-P inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells and induced apoptosis, in a dose-dependent manner. And the results from in vivo experiments demonstrated that S-GAP-P significantly inhibited the tumor growth and enhanced the peritoneal macrophages phagocytosis in S180-bearing mice. It is noteworthy that S-GAP-P could accelerate the antitumor activity of <e>CTX</e> and improve the immunocompetence damaged by CTX, suggesting the combination might increase cytotoxic efficacy and decrease toxicity of some chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment.",M2
16815546,"Low-dose thalidomide in combination with oral fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is ineffective in heavily pre-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Elevated levels of TNF-alpha have been associated with progressive disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Thalidomide has been shown to inhibit production of TNF-alpha. We investigated the effects of thalidomide on clinical outcome and TNF-alpha serum levels in five pre-treated CLL patients. The schedule consisted on daily thalidomide (Thal), oral fludarabine (Flu) and oral cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>). Median duration of treatment was 60 days; four patients stopped treatment for disease progression and one patient for neurological toxicity. Serum TNF-alpha levels did not show any decrease during treatment. Low-dose thalidomide is not effective in CLL patients with refractory disease.",M2
16797508,"Cyclophosphamide suppresses thioredoxin reductase in bladder tissue and its adaptive response via inductions of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase.Mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyzes the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin in a NADPH-dependent manner, and contains a selenocysteine residue near the C-terminus. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is one of the primary antioxidant enzymes that scavenge hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. Both TrxR and GPx play an important role in protecting against oxidative stress. Cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>), one of the most widely prescribed antineoplastic drugs, could cause cystitis. We found that 4 h after a bolus dose of CTX (30, 90, 150, 300 and 450 mg/kg) were administrated intraperitoneally, TrxR activity was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, by 32%, 44%, 68%, 87% and 99%, respectively, in comparison with control group. When fixing CTX dose at 150 mg/kg, TrxR activity changed over time, significantly reduced to 68% of the activity in comparison with control tissue at 2 h, and gradually recovered to normal level within 24 h. In addition, we found that GPx activity was induced significantly after 4h. The results of the present study suggest that marked suppression of TrxR activity could be involved in the mechanism of CTX-induced cystitis, bladder may have a protective system against tissue damage by CTX via upregulation of TrxR and GPx, which is an adaptive response to oxidative stress.",M2
16733559,"Combination of IL-12 gene therapy and <e>CTX</e> chemotherapy inhibits growth of primary B16(F10) melanoma tumors in mice.We investigated suppression of murine B16(F10) melanoma tumor growth following a therapy which involved concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide and plasmid DNA bearing interleukin-12 gene. Since both therapeutic factors display antiangiogenic capabilities, we assumed that their use in blocking the formation of new blood vessels would result in augmented inhibition of tumor growth. This combined therapy regimen indeed resulted in a considerable suppression of tumor growth. We observed a statistically significant extension of treated animals' lifespan. Interestingly, the therapeutic effect was also obtained using a plasmid without an interleukin gene insert. This observation suggests that plasmid DNA, which has been widely applied for treating neoplastic tumors, contains element(s) that elicit immune response in mice.",M2

METHODS: Patterned the methods of PFC chemotherapy in clinic, the mice were given Cisplatim 3 mg/kg x ip once a week and Cytoxan, <e>CTX</e> and 5-FU 3 mg/kg x ip once everyday for 4 weeks to set up the mice models of multi-drug resistance of S180 tumor cell. At the same time, gave the mice models matrine 4 weeks, and observed the P170, LRP, TOPO II by flow cytometry. RESULTS: matrine could obviously reduce the express of P170, LRP and the activiation of TOPO II, correlated with mulit-drug resistance tumour cells which were induced by chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Matrine, with its adjustment of correlated biotic active matter, can intervene the ocurrence of the multidrug resistance of tumor cells induced by chemotherapy.",M2
16646673,"No polarization of type 1 or type 2 precursor dendritic cells in peripheral blood stem cell collections of non-hodgkin's lymphoma patients mobilized with cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF, GM-CSF, or GM-CSF followed by G-CSF.Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells and play a role in immune reconstitution after autologous transplantation. Recent reports suggest that mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) containing regimens polarizes DCs into pDC2, which could potentially result with increased Th2 response and decreased graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic transplantation and with decreased cytotoxic Th1 response and graft versus tumor effect, which in autologous transplantation could translate into increased relapse rate. Previously, we have shown that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients receiving cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>) plus granulocyte- macrophage (GM)-CSF, G-CSF or GM-CSF followed by G-CSF for stem cell collection, mobilize up to five-fold more mature CD80(+) DCs compared to CTX plus G-CSF mobilized patients. Here, we analyzed samples from the same study for the number of pDC1 and pDC2 subsets in blood and apheresis products obtained from these patients. Samples from 29 patients were collected. Patients mobilized with CTX plus G-CSF collected a mean of 1.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) pDC1/kg per day and 2.2 +/- 1 x 10(6) pDC2/kg per day, whereas patients mobilized with CTX plus GM-CSF collected a mean of 1.1 +/- 0.5 x 10(6) pDC1 and 1.5 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) pDC2/kg per day. Patients mobilized with CTX plus GM-CSF followed by G-CSF collected 2.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) pDC1 and 2 +/- 0.5 x 106 pDC2/kg per day, with significantly higher levels of pDC1 +/- pDC2 cells. No significant difference was observed in pDC1/pDC2 ratio between the three mobilization arms. Patients mobilized with the GM-CSFcontaining regimen had a higher probability for survival compared to patients receiving G-CSF alone (median of 55 months vs. 15 months; p = 0.02). These results support the hypothesis that higher levels of DCs in the graft might be associated with prolonged survival of autotransplanted NHL patients. Further similar studies are merited in a larger population of NHL patients.",M2
16608081,"[Comparison of the long term results between two conditioning regimens MCC and BuCy in chronic myelocytic leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation]OBJECTIVE: To observe and evaluate the long term survival of patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia transplanted with MCC and BuCy conditioning regimens. METHODS: Fourteen cases were treated with MCC regimen (Melphanlan 170 mg/m2 x d x 1, MeCCNU 400 mg/m2 x d x 1, <e>CTX</e> 60 mg/kg x d x 2) and the median follow up time was 6 years; 16 cases were treated with BuCy regimen (Busulfan 4 mg/kg x d x 4, CTX 60 mg/kg x d x 2) and the median follow up time was 4 year. RESULTS: All the patients were engrafted successfully. 4 of 10 patients examined in MCC group showed mixed chimerism at day 100 after transplantation, whereas only 1 of 12 patients examined in BuCy group showed mixed chimerism. All the patients became complete donor source later without any DLI. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 71.4% for MCC group and 62.5% for BuCy group. The transplant related mortality and relapse rate were 21% and 7% for MCC group, whereas those were 25% and 12% for BuCy group, respectively. The regimen related toxicity was relatively lower in MCC group and the median duration of hospitalization was 39 days (25-55 days) for patients with MCC regimen, and 55 days (39-90 days) for BuCy regimen. CONCLUSION: MCC regimen has a partial ablative effect on CML and the long term disease-free survival is the same as that of BuCy regimen. In regard to the cost-effect efficacy, MCC regimen has a substantial advantage over BuCy regimen.",M2
16499874,"Antiangiogenic effect of low-dose cyclophosphamide combined with ginsenoside Rg3 on Lewis lung carcinoma.Angiogenesis is now known to play an important role in both growth and metastasis of lung cancer. The intense interest in angiogenesis has led to a re-examination of the activity of many established cytotoxic agents. Some results of recent experimental studies have suggested that frequent administration of certain cytotoxic agents at low doses increases the antiangiogenic activity of the drugs. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the combination of low-dose cyclophosphamide and ginsenoside Rg3 for the antiangiogenic effect on Lewis lung carcinoma. Our findings suggest that continuous low-dose regimen of <e>CTX</e> increases the efficacy of targeting the tumor microvasculature, which produces therapeutic activity with decreased toxicity. The effects of the low-dose schedule of CTX may be further enhanced by concurrent administration of angiogenic inhibitor ginsenoside Rg3. As an antiangiogenic method, this regimen has the advantage of a reduced susceptibility to drug resistance mechanisms and improved animal survival.",M2
16403279,"[Induction of immune tolerance for allogenic recipient mice by non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation]This study was aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of transplantation tolerance induced by  TBI + cyclophosphamide (<e>CTX</e>)  regimen combined with intra-bone marrow injection of allogenic BMCs. On day 0 C57BL/6 (H-2(b), B6) mice received sublethal dose of total body irradiation (TBI) ((60)Co gamma-ray) followed by intrabone marrow-bone marrow transplantation (IBM-BMT) of 3 x 10(7) cells/30 microl BMCs from BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice. The recipient mice were given CTX intraperitoneally 2 days after IBM-BMT. On day 7 skin grafting was performed and the skin survival was observed. The tolerance mechanism was investigated by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), IL-2 reverse test, adoptive transfer assay in vitro. The results showed that the mean survival time (MST) of skin allografts in group treated with TBI + CTX + BMT was significantly longer, compared with that of other groups (P &lt; 0.01). On day 90 after IBM-BMT, the phenotypic character of the recipient mice (black color) began to convert to that of the donor mice (white color). The MLR demonstrated that the immune responses of recipient mice were donor-specific tolerance. Suppressive activity in the spleen cells of tolerant B6 mice was observed in adoptive transfer assay in vitro. IL-2 reversal and the phenotypic conversion showed that the tolerance mechanisms were involved in clonal anergy and the development of chimerism. It is concluded that the nonmyeloablative regimen combined with IBM-BMT can induce a long-term tolerance, and the multiple mechanisms including clonal anergy, suppressor cells and chimerism were involved in transplantation immune tolerance.",M2
16536320,"[Effect of survivin antisense mRNA transfection on the growth and chemotherapy sensitivity of lymphoma cells]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of transfecting survivin antisense mRNA on growth and chemotherapy sensitivity of lymphoma cells. METHODS: Eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3. 1-antisense (As) survivin was constructed and transfected into Jurkat T lymphoblastic lymphoma cell lines with high expression survivin mRNA by use of lipofectmine gene transfer technique. Expression of survivin mRNA and protein were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemical and Western blot. The effect of transfecting survivin antisense mRNA on the growth of Jurkat cell lines was monitored by population doubling time (PDT) and Apoptotic indexes (AI). The morphologic features were observed in transfected cells by light and electric microscopes. MTT assay was used to analyze the response of transfected cells to <e>CTX</e> and MTX. RESULTS: Compared with the control cells, the expression of survivin mRNA and protein were reduced after transfected pcDNA3. 1-Assurvivin 48 h, 5 w and 6 w, PDT (52 h) was prolonged. Apoptotic indexes were higher in transfected antisense survivin mRNA cells [20.2% (48 h)], 6.2% (5 w) and 6.8% (6 w) than control ones [2.1%, 1.3% (48 h)] and [1.3% (5 w) and 1.0% (6 w)]. The cells grow slowly and the dead cells increase and some swelling and apoptotic cells were observed in transfected pcDNA3. 1-Assurvivin groups by invert, light and electric microscopes. The Jurkat cell line of transfected pcDNA3. 1-Assurvivin had higher sensitivity to CTX and MTX. The rate of inhibition was higher in transfected group. There is a significant difference between the transfected group and untransfected one, P &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The result indicated that survivin gene was very important for growth of Jurkat cells. To inhibit the expression of survivin will be significant in therapy of T lymphoblastic lymphoma. Survivin gene might be a target of therapy.",M2
