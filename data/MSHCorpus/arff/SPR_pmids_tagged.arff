18095097,"Substance P receptor in U373 MG human astrocytoma cells activates mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 through Src.Substance P (SP) acting through substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) increases the proliferation of glioblastoma cells. At the molecular level, stimulation of SPR in human U373 MG glioblastoma cells results in phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. Examination of the underlying mechanism reveals that SPR mediates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a calcium-dependent manner. Surprisingly, blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is transactivated by SPR, has a minimal effect on SPR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, SPR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation is significantly reduced by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Interestingly, ERK1/2 in U373 MG cells is also activated by several other mitogenic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including alpha(1B)-adrenergic, M(3)-muscarinic, and H(1)-histaminergic in an Src-dependent manner. We conclude that c-Src is a mediator of SP-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human U373 MG glioblastoma cells.",M1
17535226,"Neuropeptides and their receptors in psoriatic skin in relation to pruritus.BACKGROUND: Pruritus in patients with psoriasis has been reported to be more common than previously thought. OBJECTIVES: To determine the actual prevalence of pruritus in psoriasis according to severity of psoriasis and to verify the hypothesis of involvement of neuropeptides and their receptors in psoriatic pruritus. METHODS: We analysed questionnaire replies from 152 patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis and we assayed the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors in lesional skin biopsies obtained from psoriatic patients with pruritus compared with those from psoriatic patients without pruritus, nonlesional skin of patients with pruritic psoriasis and normal controls by confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 152 patients with psoriasis, 112 (73.7%) had pruritus, and these patients had a higher mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score than psoriatic patients without pruritus. There was positive correlation between the PASI score and the intensity of pruritus. Keratinocytes in the psoriatic plaques of patients with pruritus showed consistently increased expression of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA) and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRPR). CONCLUSIONS: Pruritus is a common feature in psoriasis. Considering the well-known roles of neuropeptides in pathogenesis of both psoriasis and pruritus, increased SPR, TrkA and CGRPR may be involved in the pathogenesis of pruritus in psoriasis and in the severity of psoriasis.",M1
16987216,"Hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells selectively innervate aspiny interneurons.The specific connectivity among principal cells and interneurons determines the flow of activity in neuronal networks. To elucidate the connections between hippocampal principal cells and various classes of interneurons, CA3 pyramidal cells were intracellularly labelled with biocytin in anaesthetized rats and the three-dimensional distribution of their axon collaterals was reconstructed. The sections were double-stained for substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)- or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha (mGluR-1alpha)-immunoreactivity to investigate interneuron targets of the CA3 pyramidal cells. SPR-containing interneurons represent a large portion of the GABAergic population, including spiny and aspiny classes. Axon terminals of CA3 pyramidal cells contacted SPR-positive interneuron dendrites in the hilus and in all hippocampal strata in both CA3 and CA1 regions (7.16% of all boutons). The majority of axons formed single contacts (87.5%), but multiple contacts (up to six) on single target neurons were also found. CA3 pyramidal cell axon collaterals innervated several types of morphologically different aspiny SPR-positive interneurons. In contrast, spiny SPR-interneurons or mGluR-1alpha-positive interneurons in the hilus, CA3 and CA1 regions were rarely contacted by the filled pyramidal cells. These findings indicate a strong target selection of CA3 pyramidal cells favouring the activation of aspiny classes of interneurons.",M1
16580093,"Differential co-expression of AMPA receptor subunits in substance P receptor-containing neurons of basal forebrain regions of C57/BL mice.We are interested in cellular co-expression patterns of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunits 1-4 (GluR1-4) in substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)-containing neurons of the basal forebrain, which may act as a morphological basis for interaction between neurokinins and glutamate-driven neuronal signaling and excitotoxicity. Immunohistochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy in adult C57/BL mice revealed that distribution of SPR-positive neurons overlapped with that of GluR1-4-containing ones in most basal forebrain regions, i.e. the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular preoptic nucleus and substantia innominata. Neurons showing both SPR and GluR1-4-immunoreactivities were found in above cholinergic neurons-rich containing basal forebrain regions. Semi-quantification analysis indicated that about 57-95% of SPR-positive neurons displayed GluR1-4-immunoreactivity. The percentages of AMPA receptor subunits co-localizing in SPR-positive neurons were GluR4 (48%), GluR1 (47%), GluR2 (26%) and GluR3 (20%), respectively. However, the neurons co-expressing SPR and GluR1-4 were hardly detected in the basal nucleus of Meynert of the basal forebrain. The co-localization of SPR and AMPA receptors has provided a molecular basis for functional interaction between neurokinins and AMPA receptors-mediated signaling in basal forebrain neurons. This study has also implied that glutamate-driven neuronal transmission and excitotoxicity can be modulated by neurokinin peptides in most basal forebrain regions but not in the basal nucleus of Meynert, suggesting that neurokinins or SP may play certain roles in determining neuronal functional properties or excitotoxic susceptibility in the various basal forebrain regions of mammals.",M1
16012865,"Signal transduction through substance P receptor in human glioblastoma cells: roles for Src and PKCdelta.Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is found in human glioblastomas, and has been implicated in their growth. Consistent with a role for SPR in cell growth, activation of SPR in U373 MG human glioblastoma cells leads to the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases [extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)] and stimulation of cell proliferation. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the pathway through which these actions occur. Using either the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor, AG 1478, or a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against human EGFR, we found that transactivation of EGFR by SPR is only marginally involved in SP-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Src, however, is shown to be a major component of SPR signaling because the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, and a kinase-dead Src mutant both inhibit SP-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also report that SPR stimulates the phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta(PKCdelta), and that this stimulation is blocked by PP2. SP-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation is also blocked by rottlerin, a PKCdelta inhibitor, and the calcium scavenger, BAPTA/AM. Finally, rottlerin and PP2 were both found to inhibit the growth of several glioblastoma cell lines, underscoring the potential of these agents to block glioblastoma growth.",M1
15754181,"Impairment of skilled forelimb use after ablation of striatal interneurons expressing substance P receptors in rats: an analysis using a pasta matrix reaching task.Local injection of substance P (SP)-saporin can cause selective ablation of striatal interneurons expressing SP receptors (<e>SPR</e>). In this study, we evaluated quantitatively the impairment of skilled forelimb use after unilateral ablation of the striatal interneurons using a pasta matrix reaching task in rats. We found a significant decrease of the number of the pasta pieces (uncooked spaghetti) retrieved using the paw of the experimental side contralateral to the ablation, whereas the number of the pasta pieces retrieved using the paw of the intact side increased significantly. These findings, with our previous reports, suggest that the modulation of the cortico-striato-entopeduncular direct pathway by striatal interneurons is important for maintaining normal basal-ganglia control for skilled forelimb movements.",M1
15196776,"Differential expression of AMPA receptor subunits in substance P receptor-containing neurons of the caudate-putamen of rats.Previous evidence has suggested that glutamate-driving neurotransmission and glutamate-excitotoxicity are modulated by substance P in the basal ganglia, but the assembly of glutamate receptors mediating this process remains to be delineated. By using a double immunofluorescence, cellular expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor subunits (GluR1-4) in substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)-containing neurons was examined in the striatum of rats. It revealed that distribution of SPR-immunoreactive neurons completely overlapped with that of GluR1, 2, 3 or 4-immunoreactive neurons in the caudate-putamen. Neurons showing both SPR and AMPA receptor subunits (except of GluR3)-immunoreactivity were observed: all (100%) of SPR-positive neurons displayed GluR1-, GluR2- or GluR4-immunoreactivity, and the double-labeled neurons constituted about 33, 3 or 29% of total GluR-positive ones. In contrast, the neurons exhibiting both SPR- and GluR3-immunoreactivity were not detected, though numerous GluR3-positive neurons were still distributed in the caudate-putamen regions. Co-localization of SPR and distinct AMPA receptor subunits in the striatal neurons has provided a basis for functional modulation of neuronal APMA receptors by substance P in the caudate-putamen of rodents. Taken together with previous observations, this study has also suggested that, through interaction with AMPA receptors composed of subunits 1, 2 and 4, substance P or neurokinin peptides may play important roles in regulating neuronal properties and protecting neurons from excitotoxicity in the basal ganglia of mammals.",M1
15195591,"[Expression of substance P receptor positive cells in the Corti's organ with acute middle ear infection in guinea pigs]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of substance P receptor(<e>SPR</e>), SPR positive cells in the Corti's organ with acute middle ear infection in guinea pigs using the polyclonal antibody of SPR. METHODS: Twelve healthy guinea pigs were employed in the experiment. After general anesthesia, by injecting 1 x 10(8)/L staphylococcosis aureus into the middle cavity of right ear with the left ear serving as control, the acute middle ear infection model was established. Then three days later, immunohistochemical staining of SPR was performed in the Cochlear base membrane preparation. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of whole cochlear preparation revealed a number of SPR positive cells expression in the cochlear base membrane, these labeled cells usually did not exist in normal cochlear tissue. Obvious difference in morphology and distribution could be identified with inner hair cells, outer hair cells vascular endothelial cell and spiral ganglion neurons. Labeled SP receptor positive cells were similar to  neurons , scattering distributed in the free margin of cochlear base membrane, with larger size and multiple projections which was 6-12 times than the erythrocyte. There were the vesicle and granular substances in the cytoplasm of the labeled cells. CONCLUSIONS: Acute middle ear infection could induce the expression of SP receptor positive nonspecific cells in the Corti's organ of guinea pigs. These cells did not exist in the normal base membrane and might participate in initiating or inducing the immune response of inner ear.",M1
15011953,"Neurokinin peptides and neurokinin receptors as potential therapeutic intervention targets of basal ganglia in the prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease.Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious motor disorder and it is the second most common brain degenerative disease in human. PD is known to be caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra but the cause of cell death is largely unknown. Mammalian neurokinins [NKs] are a group of neuropeptides that include substance P (SP; neurokinin-1, NK-1), substance K (SK; NK-2; neurokinin A), and neuromedin K (NK; NK-3; neurokinin B). Their biological effects as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurotrophic-like factors are mediated by three distinct neurokinin receptors, namely SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>: NK-1 receptor, NK-1R), SKR (NK-2R), and NKR (NK-3R). Several lines of evidence have indicated that neurokinins are implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. First, decreases of SP level and SP-immunoreactivity have been found in nigral and striatal tissues of animals with PD and postmortem PD patients. Second, NKs exert neuroprotective effects on neurons. In addition, NK receptors, namely NK-1 and NK-3 receptors, are abundantly localized in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons of the basal ganglia, indicating that these neurons are under the physiological regulation of NKs. Moreover, modulation in motor activity occurred in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice, PD animal model, after systemic administration of NK receptor agonists. NKs and NK receptors, therefore, might be important molecules that are associated with functions and survival of neurons in the basal ganglia, in particular the dopamine neurons. Further studies should be devoted to elucidate the functional roles of NK systems in (a) the neuropathogenesis and neuroprotection during the course of PD, (b) the efficacy of NK receptor drugs towards PD, and (c) potential therapeutic intervention that targets at the prevention or treatment of PD.",M1
14664911,"Cytochrome oxidase activity in the monkey globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus after ablation of striatal interneurons expressing substance P receptors.To understand functional roles of striatal interneurons in primate basal ganglia circuitry, we ablated interneurons expressing substance P (SP) receptors (<e>SPR</e>) in the putamen with SP-saporin, a SPR selective neurotoxin. The effect of SP-saporin injection into the putamen was evaluated by examining the loss of cholinergic interneurons and NADPHd-positive (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase positive) interneurons. We then analyzed regional metabolic changes using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. CO activity in some regions of the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus (GP) in the lesioned hemisphere was lower than that in the contralateral or surrounding GP regions. CO activity in the subthalamic nucleus, however, showed no significant change. The present findings suggest that striatopallidal projection neurons exert enhanced inhibitory influence on the GP without modulatory control by the striatal SPR-expressing interneurons.",M1
14514386,"[The changes of mucosal mast cells and substance P in patients with irritable bowel syndrome]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of the mast cells (MCs) and substance P (SP), and to elucidate their possible roles in visceral hypersensitivity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: In 22 diarrhea-predominant IBS, 20 constipation-predominant IBS and 19 controls, the biopsies were carried out from the terminal ileum, the ileocecal junction, the ascending colon, and the sigmoid colon. The MCs and the SP-ergic nerve terminals, SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) cells were stained by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry respectively, and the results were investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by color image analyzer. The biopsies of the ICJ and the sigmoid colon were measured by radioimmunoassay. The structure relation between the MCs and SP-ergic terminals, SPR-ergic cells were studied through an ultramicroscopy using in situ embedding technique and a light microscopic study in serial sections respectively. RESULTS: The number of MCs in the terminal ileum, the ileocecal junction, and the ascending colon were significantly elevated in IBS patients (P &lt; 0.01), and the MCs in IBS have great variations. Significantly increased the SP-ergic nerve terminals were found in patients with IBS of intestine compared with the control. The correlation between mucosal MC and the SP-ergic nerve terminals was found, and MCs were close to these terminals in lamina propria, which were demonstrated SP-ergic nerve terminals. Some MCs were demonstrated to be SPR-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: The MCs and SP of intestinal mucosa may play a central role in the gut hypersensitivity in both motor response and visceral perception in IBS.",M1
12968283,"Co-expression of molecular chaperones does not improve the heterologous expression of mammalian G-protein coupled receptor expression in yeast.The limitations to high-level expression of integral membrane proteins are not well understood. The human A(2)a adenosine receptor (A(2)a) and mouse Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) were individually expressed in S. cerevisiae to identify potential cellular bottlenecks for G-protein coupled receptors. In the yeast system, A(2)a was not N-linked glycosylated but was functional and plasma membrane-localized. A(2)a also contained an intramolecular disulfide bond. Substance P receptor was also not N-linked glycosylated in yeast, but, unlike A(2)a, SPR was intracellularly retained, nonfunctional, and did not appear to contain an intramolecular disulfide bond. Since both receptors contain N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bonds in mammalian systems, machinery responsible for interacting with these modifications was investigated-specifically, the potential interactions between the nascent receptor and ER-resident proteins were explored. The chaperones calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase were co-overexpressed with the GPCRs to determine the effect on total and active yields of A(2)a and SPR, as well as on receptor trafficking. The effect of co-expressing the chaperone BiP on the total yields of A(2)a as well as intracellular fates of both receptors were determined. The co-expression of ER resident proteins did not improve A(2)a yields nor did they restore SPR activity or improve SPR cell surface expression. Taken together, these results indicate that an ER-folding bottleneck does not limit the expression of the mammalian receptors in yeast.",M1
12892378,"Suppression of neutrophil and endothelial activation by substance P receptor blockade in the Mg-deficient rat.The regulatory role of substance-P (SP) on neutrophil and endothelium activation as well as nitric oxide (NO) production induced by Mg-deficiency was examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180 g) were fed either a Mg-deficient (MgD) or Mg-sufficient (MgS) diet for 3 weeks. Enriched neutrophil fractions (&gt; 85%) isolated from whole blood of the Mg-deficient rats displayed an 11-fold (p &lt; 0.001) higher basal superoxide anion producing activity (assayed as SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction) compared to that obtained from the MgS rats. Treatment of the MgD rats with the specific SP-receptor (<e>SPR</e>) blocker, L-703,606 (1 mg/kg/day as s.c. implanted sustained-release pellets) attenuated the superoxide anion producing activity by 75% (p &lt; 0.025). In parallel, circulating prostacyclin (PGI2) level (assayed as 6-keto-PGF-1alpha) was elevated 13-fold in the MgD rats, but was reduced 90% by L-703,606 treatment. Concomitantly, plasma NO products (nitrate + nitrite), which increased 2.2-fold during Mg-deficiency, were completely suppressed by the SPR blockade. When the isolated hearts were subjected to ischemia/ reperfusion stress, NO products were elevated 2.4-fold in the effluent of the MgD group compared to MgS; such heightened NO release was also attenuated after in vivo treatment with the SPR blocker. In conclusion, SP plays a direct role in promoting activation of the neutrophil and endothelium as well as induction of NO production; these processes might participate in the oxidative stress that contributes to the depletion of blood glutathione and cardiac pathology.",M1
12885424,"Subtypes of substance P receptor immunoreactive interneurons in the rat basolateral amygdala.Local injections of the neurotoxin SP-saporin into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are reported to specifically lesion substance P receptor immunoreactive (<e>SPR</e>-IR) interneurons, and to reduce anxiety related behavior. Hence, this technique might provide a means to study how defined interneuron populations regulate neuronal activity in the BLA. However, what interneuron subgroups in the BLA might be targeted by SP-saporin lesions has not been established. This study has used dual-labeling immunofluorescence in the rat BLA to examine SPR-IR neurons for their colocalization with the calcium-binding proteins; calbindin-D28k (CB), parvalbumin (PV), and calretinin (CR); and the neuropeptides somatostatin (SOM) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We found that all NPY-IR neurons and 45% of SOM-IR interneurons expressed SPR-IR, and that 50% and 51% of the SPR-IR interneuron population expressed NPY- and SOM-IR, respectively. Previous studies have reported that approximately a third of SOM-IR interneurons also express NPY, which suggests a large degree of overlap between the NPY, SOM and SPR expressing neurons in the BLA. We also found that the majority of SPR-IR cells were CB-IR (62%), but that these interneurons represented only 2.8% of the total CB-IR population. Moreover, SPR-IR interneurons did not express either PV-or CR- IR. Hence, SP-saporin lesions would ablate all interneurons in the BLA that contain NPY, but leave the majority of the CB-IR cells intact, and have no effect on the CR- and PV-IR populations. Consequently, these results support the use of SP-saporin lesions as a useful technique to study the role of NPY-IR interneurons in the BLA.",M1
12831852,"The striatal GABA-ergic neurons expressing substance P receptors in the basal ganglia of mice.By using a double immunofluorescence, we have examined the distribution of striatal GABAergic neurons that expressed substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the basal ganglia of adult C57 mice. The distribution of GABA-immunoreactive neurons completely or partially overlapped with that of SPR-immunoreactive neurons in the striatum (i.e. the caudate-putamen), globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. Neurons showing both GABA- and SPR-immunoreactivities were, however, predominantly found in the caudate-putamen, and most of them were characterized by their large-sized aspiny neuronal profile. Semi-quantification indicated that only about 13% of the total GABA-immunoreactive neurons (including large and medium-sized) displayed SPR-immunoreactivity, and these double-labeled neurons constituted about 31% of the total SPR-immunoreactive cells in the striatum. Neurons double-labeled with GABA- and SPR-immunoreactivities were hardly detected in other aforementioned regions of the basal ganglia. In addition, double immunofluorescence also showed co-localization of SPR- with glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactivity, but not with parvalbumin-immunoreactivity, in the striatal neurons. Taken together with previous reports, the present study has suggested that a sub-population of striatal GABA-ergic neurons, most possibly GABA-ergic interneurons, may also receive direct physiological modulation by tachykinins through SPR in the basal ganglia of mammals.",M1
12818951,"The inhibitory effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on substance p receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Substance P receptors (<e>SPR</e>) modulate nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord. The effects of IV anesthetics on SPR are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of IV anesthetics on SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We examined the effects of ketamine, pentobarbital, propofol, and tramadol on SP-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents mediated by SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a whole-cell voltage clamp. Ketamine and pentobarbital inhibited the SPR-induced currents at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, but propofol and tramadol had little effect on the currents. We also studied the effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on [(3)H]-SP to SPR. Ketamine and pentobarbital inhibited the specific binding of [(3)H]-SP to SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Scatchard analysis of [(3)H]-SP binding revealed that ketamine and pentobarbital decreased the apparent dissociation constant for binding and maximal binding, indicating noncompetitive inhibition. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I did not abolish the inhibitory effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on SP-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents. The results suggest that ketamine and pentobarbital inhibit SPR function. The mechanism of their inhibition on SPR function could not be through activation of the PKC pathway and may be due to noncompetitive displacing the SP binding. IMPLICATIONS: We investigated the effects of IV anesthetics on substance P receptors (SPR) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Ketamine and pentobarbital inhibit SPR function via noncompetitive displacing SP binding. The findings imply that the inhibition of SPR function by these compounds may play a role in the analgesic effects of these IV anesthetics.",M1
12562528,"Human substance P receptor lacking the C-terminal domain remains competent to desensitize and internalize.Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) and its naturally occurring splice-variant, lacking the C-terminal tail, are found in brain and spinal cord. Whether C-terminally truncated SPR desensitizes like full-length SPR is controversial. We used a multivaried approach to determine whether human SPR (hSPR) and a C-terminally truncated mutant, hSPRDelta325, differ in their desensitization and internalization. In HEK-293 cells expressing either hSPRDelta325 or hSPR, SP-induced desensitization of the two receptors was similar when measured by inositol triphosphate accumulation or by transient translocation of coexpressed PKCbetaII-GFP to the plasma membrane. Moreover, translocation of beta-arrestin 1 or 2-GFP (betaarr1-GFP or betaarr2-GFP) to the plasma membrane, and receptor internalization were also similar. However, hSPR and hSPRDelta325 differ in their phosphorylation and in their ability to form beta-arrestin-containing endocytic vesicles. Unlike hSPR, hSPRDelta325 is not phosphorylated to a detectable level in intact HEK293 cells, and whereas hSPR forms vesicles containing either betaarr1-GFP or betaarr2-GFP, hSPRDelta325 does not form any vesicles with betaarr1-GFP, and forms fewer vesicles with betaarr2-GFP. We conclude that truncated hSPR undergoes agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization without detectable receptor phosphorylation.",M1
12388616,"Spinal neurons that possess the substance P receptor are required for the development of central sensitization.In previous studies, we have shown that loss of spinal neurons that possess the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) attenuated pain and hyperalgesia produced by capsaicin, inflammation, and nerve injury. To determine the role of SPR-expressing neurons in modulating pain and hyperalgesia, responses of superficial and deep lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons evoked by mechanical and heat stimuli and by capsaicin were made after ablation of SPR-expressing neurons using the selective cytotoxin conjugate substance P-saporin (SP-SAP). Morphological analysis and electrophysiological recordings were made after intrathecal infusion of vehicle, saporin alone, or SP-SAP. SP-SAP, but not vehicle or SAP alone, produced an approximately 62% decrease in SPR-expressing neurons in the dorsal horn. Loss of SPR-expressing neurons diminished the responses of remaining neurons to intraplantar injection of capsaicin. Peak responses to 10 microg of capsaicin were approximately 65% lower in animals pretreated with SP-SAP compared with controls. Additionally, sensitization to mechanical and heat stimuli that normally follows capsaicin was rarely observed. Importantly, responses to mechanical and heat stimuli in the absence of capsaicin were not altered after SP-SAP treatment. In addition, nociceptive neurons did not exhibit windup in the SP-SAP-treated group. These results demonstrate that SPR-expressing neurons located in the dorsal horn are a pivotal component of the spinal circuits involved in triggering central sensitization and hyperalgesia. It appears that this relatively small population of neurons can regulate the physiological properties of other nociceptive neurons and drive central sensitization.",M1
12383972,"Immunocytochemical localization of substance P receptor in hypothalamic oxytocin-containing neurons of C57 mice.With the use of double immunofluorescence, we have examined the distribution of oxytocin-containing neurons that express substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the hypothalamus of C57 mice. The distribution of oxytocin-like immunoreactive neurons overlapped with that of SPR-like immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Neurons showing both oxytocin- and SPR-like immunoreactivities were predominantly found in both nuclei. A few neurons that were double-labeled with oxytocin- and SPR-like immunoreactivities were also scattered in the hypothalamic periventricular and preoptic regions. Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that about 94% of the oxytocin-like neurons displayed SPR-like immunoreactivity. These double-labeled cells constituted about 91% of the SPR-like neurons in the aforementioned regions. The present study provides morphological evidence for tachykinin-induced modulation of oxytocin-containing neurons as mediated by substance P receptor in the hypothalamus of mammals.",M1
11876485,"Up-regulation of substance P and NMDA receptor mRNA in dorsal horn and preganglionic sympathetic neurons during adjuvant-induced noxious stimulation in rats.Substance P (SP) and glutamate-containing terminals are found in the dorsal horn and preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSNs) in the intermedio-lateral nucleus of the spinal cord. SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) and N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) were also recognized in portions of the dorsal horn and PSNs. Primary sensory nerve fibers containing SP and glutamate terminated around PSNs, or partly on PSNs directly as well as on dorsal horn neurons (DHNs). The present study was performed to investigate the changes in SPR and NMDAR mRNA expressions during nociception in rats. Upon the injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the front paw, edema and hyperalgesia occurred immediately, with the difference in latency score between injected and non-injected paws continuing to day 10. The up-regulation of SPR and NMDAR mRNAs in DHNs and PSNs was recognized using in situ hybridization and northern blot techniques. CFA injection increased SPR mRNA expression in PSNs at days 1 and 4, and NMDAR mRNA expression at days 1, 4 and 7. At day 14, the mRNA expression of both receptors decreased to the control level. These changes in the amount of receptor mRNAs in DHNs and PSNs may cause hyperalgesia and sympathetically mediated pain.",M1
11790480,"Tooth extraction-induced internalization of the substance P receptor in trigeminal nucleus and spinal cord neurons: imaging the neurochemistry of dental pain.Although pains arising from the craniofacial complex can be severe and debilitating, relatively little is known about the peripheral and central mechanisms that generate and maintain orofacial pain. To better understand the neurons in the trigeminal complex and spinal cord that are activated following nociceptive stimuli to the orofacial complex, we examined substance P (SP) induced internalization of substance P receptors (<e>SPR</e>) in neurons following dental extraction in the rat. Unilateral gingival reflection or surgical extraction of a rat maxillary incisor or molar was performed and tissues harvested at various time points post-extraction. Immunohistochemical analysis of brainstem and cervical spinal cord sections was performed using an anti-SPR antibody and confocal imaging. Both the number and location of neurons showing SPR internalization was dependent on the location and extent of tissue injury. Whereas extraction of the incisor induced internalization of SPR in neurons bilaterally in nucleus caudalis and the spinal cord, extraction of the molar induced strictly unilateral internalization of SPR-expressing neurons in the same brain structures. Minor tissue injury (retraction of the gingiva) activated SPR neurons located in lamina I whereas more extensive and severe tissue injury (incisor or molar extraction) induced extensive SPR internalization in neurons located in both laminae I and III-V. The rostrocaudal extent of the SPR internalization was also correlated with the extent of tissue injury. Thus, following relatively minor tissue injury (gingival reflection) neurons showing SPR internalization were confined to the nucleus caudalis while procedures which cause greater tissue injury (incisor or molar extraction), neurons showing SPR internalization extended from the interpolaris/caudalis transition zone through the C7 spinal level. Defining the population of neurons activated in orofacial pain and whether analgesics modify the activation of these neurons should provide insight into the mechanisms that generate and maintain acute and chronic orofacial pain.",M1
11772805,"The inhibitory effects of anesthetics and ethanol on substance P receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.The neuropeptide substance P (SP) modulates nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord. SP is unique to a subpopulation of C fibers found within primary afferent nerves. However, the effects of anesthetics on the SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of volatile anesthetics and ethanol on SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We examined the effects of halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, diethyl ether, and ethanol on SP-induced currents mediated by SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes, by using a whole-cell voltage clamp. All the volatile anesthetics tested, and ethanol, inhibited SPR-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (bisindolylmaleimide) enhanced the SP-induced Cl(-) currents. However, bisindolylmaleimide abolished the inhibitory effects on SPR of the volatile anesthetics examined and of ethanol. These results demonstrate that halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, diethyl ether, and ethanol inhibit the function of SPR and suggest that activation of protein kinase C is involved in the mechanism of action of anesthetics and ethanol on the inhibitory effects of SPR. IMPLICATIONS: We examined the effects of halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, diethyl ether, and ethanol on substance P receptor (SPR) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, by using a whole-cell voltage clamp. All the anesthetics and ethanol inhibited SPR function, and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor abolished these inhibitions. These results suggest that anesthetics and ethanol inhibit SPR function via PKC.",M1
11717901,"[Distribution of substance P receptors in rat nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis]OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential role of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the initiation and development of allergic rhinitis (AR). METHODS: Twenty healthy rats were randomly divided into two groups. A model of allergic rhinitis in rat was established by using ovalbumin intraperitoneal immunization and nasal antigen challenge. The nasal mucosa obtained from seven out of ten AR models as well as ten normal controls were studied routinely by HE and immunohistochemical staining to observe the distribution and changes of SPR. RESULTS: The study showed that immunoreactivity to SPR was present both on the surface and in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells, eosinophils, glandular cells and its ducts, mast cells, plasmocyte and other monocytes. During nasal hypersensitiveness, the staining density and the positive staining cells increased significantly as compared with those in normal controls. CONCLUSION: The increase of SPR in nasal mucosa in rat AR model indicates that SPR might play a critical role in the development of AR.",M1
11683288,"Modulation of substance P and somatostatin receptors in cutaneous lymphocytic inflammatory and tumoral infiltrates.BACKGROUND: The expression of receptors for neuropeptides in the skin is modified in skin diseases. OBJECTIVE: We studied the cutaneous expression of substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SOM) receptors (<e>SPR</e> and SSTR, respectively) in skin affected by cutaneous inflammatory or tumoral T-cell infiltrates because these two neuropeptides are the ones most involved in inflammation. METHODS: We revealed expression of these receptors using a binding in situ technique that gave highly specific results. Skin biopsies were incubated with biotinylated neuropeptides (SP or SOM). RESULTS: In normal skin, SSTR were observed on blood vessels, smooth muscle fibres and sweat glands. SSTR expression was modified only when expressed by keratinocytes in Ofuji papuloerythroderma and by plasmocytes in plasmocytoma. SPR distribution was not modified in subjects with atopic dermatitis or lupus. The expression of SPR in the epidermis was diminished in Ofuji papuloerythroderma and parapsoriasis and absent in mycosis fungoides. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that malignant lymphocytic infiltrates can inhibit SPR expression on keratinocytes.",M1
11516425,"Cholinergic neurons expressing substance P receptor (NK(1)) in the basal forebrain of the rat: a double immunocytochemical study.Cholinergic neurons expressing substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>, NK(1)) were examined in the rat brain using double immunofluorescence. The distribution of SPR-like immunoreactive (SPR-LI) neurons completely overlapped with that of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-LI neurons in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of diagonal band of Broca, the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the substantia innominata of basal forebrain, the caudate-putamen, and the ventral pallidum of the basal ganglia. In the mesopontine tegmentum and the cranial motor nuclei of the brainstem, the distribution of SPR-LI and ChAT-LI neurons was partially overlapping. Neurons showing both SPR-like and ChAT-like immunoreactivities, however, were predominantly found above basal forebrain regions and 82-90% of these ChAT-LI neurons displayed SPR-like immunoreactivity, in addition to the confirmatory observation that 100% of the ChAT-LI neurons exhibit SPR-like immunoreactivity in the basal ganglia. In contrast, neurons double-labeled for SPR-like and ChAT-like immunoreactivities were hardly detected in aforementioned regions of the brainstem. The present study has provided morphological evidence for direct physiological modulation of cholinergic neurons by tachykinins through substance P receptor in the basal forebrain of the rat.",M1
11438920,"Focal inhibitory interneuron loss and principal cell hyperexcitability in the rat hippocampus after microinjection of a neurotoxic conjugate of saporin and a peptidase-resistant analog of Substance P.Episodes of prolonged seizures or head trauma produce chronic hippocampal network hyperexcitability hypothesized to result primarily from inhibitory interneuron loss or dysfunction. The possibly causal role of inhibitory neuron failure in the development of epileptiform pathophysiology remains unclear because global neurologic injuries produce such a multitude of effects. The recent finding that Substance P receptors (<e>SPRs</e>) are expressed exclusively in the rat hippocampus by inhibitory interneurons provided the rationale for attempting to ablate interneurons selectively by using neurotoxic conjugates of SPR ligands and the ribosome inactivating protein saporin that specifically target Substance P receptor-expressing cells. Whereas intrahippocampal microinjection of a conjugate of native SP and saporin produced significant nonspecific damage at concentrations needed to produce even limited selective loss of SPR-positive cells, a conjugate of saporin and the more potent and peptidase-resistant SP analog [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)] Substance P (SSP-saporin) caused negligible nonspecific damage at the injection site, and a virtually complete loss of SPR-like immunoreactivity (LI) up to 1 mm from the injection site. Within the SPR depletion zone, immunoreactivities for most GABA-, parvalbumin-, somatostatin-, and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cells and fibers were eliminated. The few interneurons detectable within the affected zone were devoid of SPR-LI. The apparent loss of interneurons was selective in that calbindin- and glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) -positive principal cells survived within the affected zone, as did myelinated fibers and the extrinsic calretinin- and tyrosine hydroxylase--immunoreactive terminals of subcortical afferents. An apparent lack of reactive synaptic reorganization in response to interneuron loss was indicated by zinc transporter-3 (ZnT3)-- and beta-synuclein--LI, as well as by Timm staining, all of which revealed relatively normal patterns of excitatory terminal distribution. Control injections produced minor damage at the injection site, but no apparent specific loss of SPR-LI. One to 12 weeks after injection of SSP-saporin, extracellular electrophysiological field responses recorded in the CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cell layers in response to afferent stimulation were blindly evaluated simultaneously in two sites 1-2 mm apart along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. SSP-saporin-treated rats exhibited relatively normal responses in some sites, whereas disinhibition and hyperexcitability indistinguishable from the pathophysiology produced by experimental status epilepticus were simultaneously recorded at adjacent sites. Anatomic analysis of the recording sites in each animal revealed that epileptiform pathophysiology was consistently observed only within areas of SPR ablation, whereas relatively normal evoked responses were recorded from immediately adjacent and relatively unaffected regions. These data establish the efficacy of [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)] Substance P-saporin for producing a selective and spatially extensive ablation of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons in vivo and a highly focal disinhibition that was restricted to the site of interneuron loss. These results also demonstrate that the  epileptic  pathophysiology produced by experimental status epilepticus or head trauma can be replicated by focal interneuron loss per se, without involving principal cell loss and other interpretive confounds inherent in the use of global neurologic injury models.",M1
11324567,"[Peripheral substance P receptor mediating c-fos gene expression in the spinal dorsal horn induced by peripheral noxious stimulation]Employing immunohistochemical staining for FOS protein, which is the expression product of c-fos proto-oncogene, the role of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in noxious information transmission at peripheral terminals of the dorsal root ganglion cells was investigated by means of a selective SPR antagonist L668, 169 and agonist Sar-SP. Unilateral injection of L668, 169 (10(-4) mol/L) into the plantar of hindpaw 10 min before injection of 4% formalin, the number of FOS-like immunoreactive (LI) neurons in the superficial laminae of dorsal horn was significantly decreased, but the changes were not obvious in the deeper laminae. Smaller doses of L668, 169 (10(-5), 10(-6) mol/L) were almost ineffective on FOS-LI neurons in both the superficial and the deeper laminae. However, Sar-SP (10(-4) mol/L) or formalin did result in the expression of c-fos gene in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn. These results indicated that SP might contribute to the transmission of nociceptive information and induce noxious sensation, at least in part by activating SPR in peripheral terminals of the dorsal root ganglion cells.",M1
11292655,"Interleukin 12 and antigen independently induce substance P receptor expression in T cells in murine schistosomiasis mansoni.Substance P (SP) regulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production through interaction with the SP receptor NK1 (<e>SPr</e>) on T cells at sites of inflammation. Using murine schistosomiasis, we evaluated whether SPr expression was subject to immunoregulation. Splenocytes from schistosome-infected mice cultured for &lt; or =18 h did not express SPr, as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. However, exposure to schistosome egg antigen (SEA) for &lt; or =4 h induced strong receptor expression. Experiments using splenocytes fractionated with antibody-coupled, paramagnetic beads showed that induction localized exclusively to T cells. Receptor protein expression was confirmed with Western blot. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) also induced strong T-cell SPr expression. Both SEA and IL-12 remained strong inducers of T-cell SPr in lymphocytes from the IL-12 (p40) and IFN-gamma R double-knockout mouse, which suggested that SEA did not require IL-12 to induce SPr and that both worked independently of IFN-gamma. Splenocytes from wild-type mice cultured with SEA and neutralizing anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody (mAb) also showed SPr induction. However, anti-Ia mAb inhibited SEA induction of SPR: Thus, SPr is inducible on T cells. SEA induces SPr through interaction with T-cell receptor (TCR), independently of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. IL-12 induces SPr independently of TCR activation and IFN-gamma expression. SP and its receptor, which regulate IFN-gamma production, are probably part of the IL-12-Th1 circuit.",M1
11169468,"Substance P receptor expression by inhibitory interneurons of the rat hippocampus: enhanced detection using improved immunocytochemical methods for the preservation and colocalization of GABA and other neuronal markers.Two unresolved issues regarding the identification and characterization of hippocampal interneurons were addressed in this study. One issue was the longstanding inability to detect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the somata of several hippocampal interneuron subpopulations, which has prevented the unequivocal identification of all hippocampal interneurons as GABA neurons. The second issue was related to the identification of the hippocampal interneurons that constitutively express substance P (neurokinin-1) receptors (<e>SPRs</e>). The recent development of neurotoxins that specifically target SPR-expressing cells suggests that it may be possible to destroy hippocampal inhibitory interneurons selectively for experimental purposes. Although SPRs are apparently expressed in the hippocampus only by interneurons, colocalization studies have found that most interneurons of several subtypes and hippocampal subregions appear SPR-negative. Thus, the identities and locations of the inhibitory interneurons that are potential targets of an SPR-directed neurotoxin remain in doubt. Using newly developed methods designed to copreserve and colocalize GABA and polypeptide immunoreactivities with increased sensitivity, the authors report that virtually all hippocampal interneuron somata that are immunoreactive for parvalbumin (PV), calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin (SS), neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide exhibited clearly detectable, somal, GABA-like immunoreactivity (LI). Hippocampal SPR-LI was detected only on the somata and dendrites of GABA-immunopositive interneurons. All glutamate receptor subunit 2-immunoreactive principal cells, including dentate granule cells, hilar mossy cells, and hippocampal pyramidal cells, were devoid of detectable SPR-LI, even after prolonged electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway that induced the expression of other neuronal proteins in principal cells. Thus, hippocampal interneurons of all subtypes and subregions were found to be SPR-immunoreactive, including the PV-positive interneurons of the dentate hilus and hippocampus, and the SS-positive cells of area CA1, both of which were previously reported to lack SPR-LI. Only minor proportions of hippocampal interneurons appeared clearly devoid of detectable SPR-LI. These results demonstrate for the first time that all identified interneuron subpopulations of the rat hippocampus are GABA-immunoreactive, and that many inhibitory interneurons of all subtypes in all subregions of the rat hippocampus express SPRs constitutively.",M1
11125799,"Morphological change of substance P receptor immunoreactive dendrites of preganglionic sympathetic neurons.Substance P (SP)-containing terminals and SP receptors (<e>SPRs</e>) are found on the dendrites of preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSNs) in the intermedio-lateral nucleus (IML) of the spinal cord. The SP-containing fibers were thought to be of supraspinal origin. However, the primary sensory nerve fibers terminated around PSNs, and some of them directly on PSNs. We observed approximately 150 SPR-immunoreactive (ir) varicosities on the dendrites of PSNs in slices of the first thoracic segment (T1) in control rats. The number of varicosities decreased to 41% 14 days after hemisection of the spinal cord at the fourth cervical segment (C4), and to 55% 14 days after sectioning the spinal dorsal roots at the C8 and T1 levels. The number of varicosities decreased by 33% in 8-week-old rats which had been administered capsaicin subcutaneously within 24 hours after birth to eradicate unmyelinated sensory fibers. However, varicosities increased by 15% 15 minutes after injection of capsaicin into the plantar surface of the front paw to stimulate somatosensory nerve fibers in adult rats. The results demonstrate that SPR-ir varicosities on the dendrites of PSNs were modulated not only by the supraspinal nervous system but also directly by the primary sensory nerve terminals.",M1
11044592,"Collateral projection of substance P receptor expressing neurons in the medullary dorsal horn to bilateral parabrachial nuclei of the rat.Employing a combination of fluorescent retrograde double labeling and immunofluorescence histochemistry for substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), we examined the collateral projection from single SPR-like immunoreactive neurons in the medullary dorsal horn (caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus) to bilateral parabrachial nuclei in the rat. After injection of fast blue (FB) or diamidino yellow (DY) into the right or left parabrachial nucleus, respectively, single-labeled FB or DY neurons and double-labeled FB/DY neurons were observed mainly bilaterally in laminae I and II of the medullary dorsal horn. Some of the single-labeled FB or DY and double-labeled FB/DY neurons showed SPR-like immunoreactivity, especially in lamina I. In lamina I of left medullary dorsal horn which is ipsilateral to the DY injection into the PBN, the percentages of double-labeled FB/DY neurons to the total number of FB- or DY-labeled neurons were 34.0% or 20.2%, triple-labeled FB/DY/SPR neurons to the total number of FB/DY double-labeled or SPR-like immunoreactive neurons were 22.0% or 2.4%, respectively. In lamina I of the right medullary dorsal horn which is ipsilateral to the FB injection into the PBN, the percentages of double-labeled FB/DY neurons to the total number of FB- or DY-labeled neurons were 12.9% or 59.3%, triple-labeled FB/DY/SPR neurons to the total number of double-labeled FB/DY or SPR-like immunoreactive neurons were 24. 6% or 3.9%, respectively. The results suggest that some of the single SPR expressing neurons in the medullary dorsal horn might be innervated by substance P containing primary afferent fibers and transmit sensory information diffusely to bilateral parabrachial nuclei by way of their axonal collaterals.",M1
10915824,"Noradrenergic neurons expressing substance P receptor (NK1) in the locus coeruleus complex: a double immunofluorescence study in the rat.By using a double immunofluorescence method we examined the distribution of noradrenergic neurons expressing substance P receptor (NK1) or neuromedin K receptor (NK3) in the rat brainstem. The distribution of <e>SPR</e>-like immunoreactive (-LI) neurons completely overlapped that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-LI neurons in the locus coeruleus (A6), ventrolateral and lateral reticular formation of pons (A5 and A7). Partially overlapping distribution of SPR- and TH-LI neurons were found in certain regions of the medulla oblongata (A1-A4). Neurons showing both SPR- and TH-like immunoreactivities, however, were only found in the locus coeruleus complex (A5-A7): 100% of these TH-LI neurons displayed SPR-like immunoreactivity. Neurons showing both NKR- and TH-like immunoreactivities were not detected in the aforementioned areas of brainstem. The present study has provided morphological evidence for direct physiological modulation of noradrenergic neurons by tachykinins through SPR in locus coeruleus complex (A5-A7).",M1
10876032,"Immunohistochemical localization of substance P receptors in the midline glia of the developing rat medulla oblongata with special reference to the formation of raphe nuclei.Immunohistochemical localization of the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) was examined in the developing rat medulla oblongata, with special reference to the development of substance P (SP)-immunoreactive neurons which form the medullary raphe nuclei. During development, SPR immunoreactivity was detected in cells lying lateral to the medullary midline from embryonic day 13 (E13) to postnatal day 5 (P5). The SPR-positive cell bodies were located close to the fourth ventricle, and bore long processes extending to the ventral pial surface. This SPR immunoreactivity co-localized with staining for monoclonal antibody 1D11, a specific marker of immature astrocytes. Substance P (SP)-immunoreactive neurons were first detected at E14 in the ventrolateral part of the medulla. By E16 their number had increased and they were arrayed in two rows closely parallel to the SPR-immunoreactive processes of non-neuronal cells. By P1, two separate SP-immunoreactive cell clusters could be recognized at the midline, representing dorsally the nascent raphe pallidus and ventrally the raphe obscurus. In addition, many SP-immunoreactive fibers traveled rostrocaudally in the medulla oblongata, juxtaposed to the midline sheets of SPR-immunoreactive long processes. SPR-immunoreactive processes at the midline were also immunoreactive for S-100, a glia-specific calcium-binding protein that is known to promote axonal growth of raphe neurons. These results suggest that SPR-expressing immature glial cells at the medullary midline are involved in the development of SP-immunoreactive raphe neurons, both in the formation of the medullary raphe nuclei and in axon guidance and growth.",M1
10816627,"Gut peptide receptor expression in human pancreatic cancers.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) peptide receptor expression in pancreatic cancers, and to further assess signaling mechanisms regulating neurotensin (NT)-mediated pancreatic cancer growth. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the leading causes of GI cancer death; novel strategies for the early detection and treatment of these cancers is required. Previously, the authors have shown that NT, an important GI hormone, stimulates the proliferation of an NT receptor (NTR)-positive pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A total of 26 human pancreatic adenocarcinomas, obtained after resection, and 5 pancreatic cancer xenografts were analyzed for expression of NTR, vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VIPR), substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). In addition, NTR expression, [Ca2+]i mobilization, and growth in response to NT was determined in L3.6, a metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line. RESULTS: Neurotensin receptor was expressed in 88% of the surgical specimens examined and all five of the pancreatic cancer xenografts. In contrast, VIPR, SPR, and GRPR expression was detected in 31%, 27%, and 8% of pancreatic cancers examined, respectively. Expression of NTR, functionally coupled to the Ca2+ signaling pathway, was identified in L3.6 cells; treatment with NT (10 micromol/L) stimulated proliferation of these cells. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated NTR expression in most of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas examined. In contrast, VIPR, SPR, and GRPR expression was detected in fewer of the pancreatic cancers. The expression of NTR and other peptide receptors suggests the potential role of endocrine manipulation in the treatment of these cancers. Further, the presence of GI receptors may provide for targeted chemotherapy or radiation therapy or in vivo scintigraphy for early detection.",M1
10567262,"Transmission of chronic nociception by spinal neurons expressing the substance P receptor.Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)-expressing spinal neurons were ablated with the selective cytotoxin substance P-saporin. Loss of these neurons resulted in a reduction of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia associated with persistent neuropathic and inflammatory pain states. This loss appeared to be permanent. Responses to mildly painful stimuli and morphine analgesia were unaffected by this treatment. These results identify a target for treating persistent pain and suggest that the small population of SPR-expressing neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",M1
10536860,"Substance P receptor-like immunoreactive neurons in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus send axons to the gelatinosus thalamic nucleus in the rat.By means of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) immunofluorescence histochemistry combined with Fluoro-Gold (FG) fluorescent retrograde labeling, SPR-like immunoreactive neurons in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus of the rat were observed to send their axons to the gelatinosus thalamic nucleus with a clear ipsilateral dominance. FG/SPR double-labeled neurons were distributed mainly in the ventral part of lamina I at the rostral level of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus. The percentages of FG/SPR-LI neurons in the total number of SPR-LI neurons and FG-labeled neurons are 10.5% and 31.1%, respectively. The present results suggest that trigemino-gelatinosus thalamic projection neurons with SPR-LI in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus might receive SP-containing, nociceptive primary afferent fibers from the orofacial region and transmit nociception to the gelatinosus thalamic nucleus.",M1
10460273,"Spinal substance P receptor expression and internalization in acute, short-term, and long-term inflammatory pain states.Inflammatory pain involves the sensitization of both primary afferent and spinal cord neurons. To explore the neurochemical changes that contribute to inflammatory pain, we have examined the expression and ligand-induced internalization of the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the spinal cord in acute, short-term, and long-term inflammatory pain states. These inflammatory models included unilateral injection of formalin (8-60 min), carrageenan (3 hr), and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; 3 d) into the rat hindpaw as well as adjuvant-induced polyarthritis (21 d). In acute inflammatory pain there is ongoing release of substance P (SP) as measured by SPR internalization in lamina I neurons at both 8 and 60 min after formalin injection. Although there is no tonic release of SP in short-term inflammatory pain, at 3 hr after carrageenan injection, SP is released in response to both noxious and non-noxious somatosensory stimulation with SPR internalization being observed in neurons located in both laminae I and III-IV. In long-term inflammatory pain models (CFA and polyarthritis) the same pattern of SP release and SPR activation occurs as is observed in short-term inflammation with the addition that there is a significant upregulation of the SPR in lamina I neurons. These results suggest that SPR internalization might serve as a marker of the contribution of ongoing primary afferent input in acute and persistent pain states. These stereotypical neurochemical changes suggest that there are unique neurochemical signatures for acute, short-term, and long-term inflammatory pain.",M1

Substance P receptor-like immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies were seen most frequently in lamina I, and were scattered throughout the remaining laminae of the dorsal horn and the area around the central canal. Some neurons in the intermediolateral nucleus also showed weak immunoreactivity. The pattern of distribution of SPR-LI neurons in the adult spinal cord was essentially the same as that in the newborn spinal cord. However, SPR-LI neurons cell bodies were seen much more frequently in the newborn than in the adult dorsal horn, especially in lamina II.",M1
10229849,"The substance P receptor is necessary for a normal granulomatous response in murine schistosomiasis mansoni.Immune cells within the granulomas of murine schistosomiasis mansoni make the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and express neurokine 1 receptor, which is the specific receptor for substance P (<e>SPr</e>). It was determined if mice with deletion of the SPr (SPr-/-) would develop a normal granulomatous response to schistosome ova during the course of natural infection. Mean liver granuloma size was smaller in SPr-/- mice compared with that of wild-type control animals. Although flow analysis revealed little difference in the cellular composition of the granulomas, both splenocytes and granuloma cells from SPr-/- mice produced much less IFN-gamma and IgG2a and less IgE. The expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-5) and IgG1 was comparable to the wild-type control. The mouse with targeted disruption of its SPr had the nonmammalian gene encoding the enzyme beta-galactosidase inserted in exon 1 of the SPr gene. There was beta-galactosidase activity in many mononuclear cells scattered throughout the schistosome granulomas of SPr-/- mice. Also, a granuloma T cell line derived from this transgenic mouse produced beta-galactosidase. These results provide further evidence that in murine schistosomiasis SPr is displayed commonly on granuloma inflammatory cells and is important for granuloma development and expression of IFN-gamma circuitry in this natural infection.",M1
10220564,"Characterization of differences between rapid agonist-dependent phosphorylation and phorbol ester-mediated phosphorylation of human substance P receptor in intact cells.Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), which plays a key role in pain transmission, is known to undergo rapid agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization. The present study shows that human SPR undergoes agonist-dependent phosphorylation in intact cells. Immunoprecipitation of SPR from 32Pi-labeled Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human SPR (CHO-hSPR) indicates that substance P (SP) causes a rapid (T1/2 &lt; 1 min), dose-dependent (EC50 = 2 nM), and pronounced (5-fold over basal) phosphorylation of SPR. Because SPR in CHO-hSPR couples to Galphaq, Galphas, and Galphao (), we examined the involvement of various second messenger-activated protein kinases in SPR phosphorylation. Although increases in intracellular cyclic AMP or treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 do not cause SPR phosphorylation, treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) causes a 2.5-fold increase in SPR phosphorylation with a T1/2 of &lt;1 min. However, PKC inhibitor GF109203X has no effect on SP-dependent SPR phosphorylation. Furthermore, although SP treatment phosphorylates SPR on both serine and threonine residues equally, PMA treatment phosphorylates the receptor predominantly on serine residues. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping data indicate that SP-dependent and PMA-dependent phosphorylations of SPR have some unique differences. Taken together, these data suggest that although activation of PKC by PMA can lead to SPR phosphorylation, PKC does not mediate SP-dependent phosphorylation of SPR. In conclusion, the present study represents the first demonstration and characterization of agonist-dependent and PMA-mediated phosphorylation of SPR in intact cells.",M1
10085363,"Primary afferent fibers that contribute to increased substance P receptor internalization in the spinal cord after injury.Upon noxious stimulation, substance P (SP) is released from primary afferent fibers into the spinal cord where it interacts with the SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>). The SPR is located throughout the dorsal horn and undergoes endocytosis after agonist binding, which provides a spatial image of SPR-containing neurons that undergo agonist interaction. Under normal conditions, SPR internalization occurs only in SPR+ cell bodies and dendrites in the superficial dorsal horn after noxious stimulation. After nerve transection and inflammation, SPR immunoreactivity increases, and both noxious as well as nonnoxious stimulation produces SPR internalization in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. We investigated the primary afferent fibers that contribute to enhanced SPR internalization in the spinal cord after nerve transection and inflammation. Internalization evoked by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve was examined in untreated animals, at 14 days after sciatic nerve transection or sham surgery and at 3 days after hindpaw inflammation. Electrical stimulation was delivered at intensities to excite Abeta fibers only, Abeta and Adelta fibers or A and C fibers as determined by the compound action potential recorded from the tibial nerve. Electrical stimuli were delivered at a constant rate of 10 Hz for a duration of 5 min. Transection of the sciatic nerve and inflammation produced a 33.7 and 32.5% increase in SPR and immunoreactivity in lamina I, respectively. Under normal conditions, stimulation of Adelta or C fibers evoked internalization that was confined to the superficial dorsal horn. After transection or inflammation, there was a 20-24% increase in the proportion of SPR+ lamina I neurons that exhibited internalization evoked by stimulation of Adelta fibers. The proportion of lamina I SPR+ neurons that exhibited internalization after stimulation of C-fibers was not altered by transection or inflammation because this was nearly maximal under normal conditions. Moreover, electrical stimulation sufficient to excite C fibers evoked SPR internalization in 22% of SPR+ lamina III neurons after nerve transection and in 32-36% of SPR+ neurons in lamina III and IV after inflammation. Stimulation of Abeta fibers alone never evoked internalization in the superficial or deep dorsal horn. These results indicate that activation of small-caliber afferent fibers contributes to the enhanced SPR internalization in the spinal cord after nerve transection and inflammation and suggest that recruitment of neurons that possess the SPR contributes to hyperalgesia.",M1
10066824,"Real-time visualization of the cellular redistribution of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and beta-arrestin 2 during homologous desensitization of the substance P receptor.The substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a key role in pain regulation. The SPR desensitizes in the continued presence of agonist, presumably via mechanisms that implicate G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and beta-arrestins. The temporal relationship of these proposed biochemical events has never been established for any GPCR other than rhodopsin beyond the resolution provided by biochemical assays. We investigate the real-time activation and desensitization of the human SPR in live HEK293 cells using green fluorescent protein conjugates of protein kinase C, GRK2, and beta-arrestin 2. The translocation of protein kinase C betaII-green fluorescent protein to and from the plasma membrane in response to substance P indicates that the human SPR becomes activated within seconds of agonist exposure, and the response desensitizes within 30 s. This desensitization process coincides with a redistribution of GRK2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, followed by a robust redistribution of beta-arrestin 2 and a profound change in cell morphology that occurs after 1 min of SPR stimulation. These data establish a role for GRKs and beta-arrestins in homologous desensitization of the SPR and provide the first visual and temporal resolution of the sequence of events underlying homologous desensitization of a GPCR in living cells.",M1
10022336,"Distribution of <e>SPR</e>-like immunoreactivity in the medullary visceral zone of the rat and changes following acute myocardial ischemia induced by intravenous injection of vasopressin.Substance P receptor-like immunoreactive (SPR-LI) structures and changes following intravenous injection of vasopressin in the medullary visceral zone (MVZ) of the rat were studied by using immunohistochemical methods. In normal control rats the distribution of SPR-LI structure in MVZ generally matched with that of immunostaining against substance P (SP-LI) except in some areas. SPR-LI neurons and dendrites differed in size and shape in different areas of MVZ. Their dendrites could be classified into three types, i.e, wool-shaped, smooth and varicose. Some SPR-LI neurons were also positive for tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity (TH-LI) . After administration of vasopressin SPR-LI structures became denser, especially at levels of pyramidal decussation (PYX) and area postrema (AP). The dendrites of motor dorsal nucleus of X (NMDX) in the dorsal part of MVZ appeared thin and straight in morphology instead of curl and thick outlooks. These results implicate that some SPR-LI neurons might be involved in the modulation of the cardiovascular stress induced by vasopressin.",M1
9873229,"Expression of substance P receptors in normal and psoriatic skin.Recently, substance P receptors (<e>SPR</e>) have been detected in neonatal foreskin.

As SP has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory cutaneous lesions, we wondered whether SPR localization was modified in psoriatic lesions. In normal skin, SP binding sites were detected using biotinylated SP and abrogated by a specific NK1 antagonist (spantide) on blood vessels, sweat glands and hair follicles. In the normal epidermis, SPR were usually observed on granular layers but may also be observed on other cell layers. The SP binding processed on cultured keratinocytes demonstrated that SPR were expressed in the epidermis, except basal cell layers, confirming that keratinocytes constitutively express SPR. In skin lesions of psoriatic patients, SP binding sites were expressed on the uppermost keratinocytes which are not granular cells, and seem to be overexpressed. Our results raise the question of the role of SPR on psoriatic keratinocytes.",M1
9725216,"Substance P (neurokinin-1) receptor is a marker of human mucosal but not peripheral mononuclear cells: molecular quantitation and localization.Reciprocal communication between the immune system and the neuroendocrine system is mediated via a common chemical language of shared ligands and receptors. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been implicated as a mediator of immunomodulation. The evidence for substance P receptors on human lymphocytes is, however, controversial. The aims of the present study are to investigate substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) expression in human peripheral and mucosal mononuclear cells and to identify cellular sites of expression in human colonic mucosa. Using reverse-transcriptase PCR, we demonstrate that PBMC isolations are negative for SPR mRNA expression, whereas lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) isolations express on average eight SPR mRNA transcripts per cell. In situ hybridization performed on surgically resected colonic tissue confirms the expression of SPR mRNA in LPMC in vivo. SPR mRNA signal was detected in LPMC, lymphoid follicles, and epithelium. The complementary technique of immunohistochemistry gave a similar distribution of SPR expression that colocalized with CD45 immunoreactivity. Dual-fluorochrome flow cytometry revealed SPR expression by CD4, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD8, CD19, and CD14 LPMC subsets, but not PBMC. Our findings suggest that SPR expression is distinctive of human colonic mucosal mononuclear cells and support a direct role for SP in mucosal immunomodulation.",M1
9717704,"Immunocytochemical localization of substance P receptor in rat periaqueductal gray matter: a light and electron microscopic study.The distribution of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) protein in the rat periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) was investigated with a polyclonal antibody in the four subdivisions obtained by cytochrome-oxidase histochemistry (Co-hi). At light microscopic analysis, immunoreactivity appeared particularly dense in the dorsal subdivision of the PAG, was less intense in the other subdivisions, and formed several longitudinally organized columns. SPR-like immunoreactivity (SP(R-i)) was localized mostly to cell bodies and dendrites of small and medium-sized neurons, which constituted about 6% of the total neuronal population of the PAG. At the electron microscopic level, SP(R-i) could be observed on postsynaptic as well as on nonsynaptic regions of both cell bodies and dendrites. A small proportion of axons (4.2%) and axon terminals (5.3%) showed SP(R-i), the majority of labeled axon terminals, amounting to about 70% of synapsing elements, formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites. Rare astroglial processes displaying SP(R-i) were also observed scattered throughout the neuropil of all PAG subdivisions. Our observations suggest that 1) also in the PAG, SP may act in a diffuse, nonsynaptic manner, probably on targets that are distant from its sites of release; and 2) SP may modulate excitatory neurotransmission acting presynaptically on those labeled axons that form asymmetric synapses.",M1
9679937,"High affinity binding sites for [3H]substance P in urinary bladders of cats with interstitial cystitis.PURPOSE: Pain is a common feature of interstitial cystitis (IC). Although the effects of IC on sensory neuron density have been investigated, its influence on substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) numbers and function are not well known. To evaluate the role of SPR in cats with IC, we measured the affinity (Kd), numbers (Bmax), and substrate specificity of binding sites for [3H]SP in urinary bladders of healthy cats and cats suffering from IC. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Radioligand binding assays of cat and rat brain, normal cat bladders, and inflamed bladders from cats diagnosed with IC were conducted using [3H]SP to determine SPR affinity and numbers. Binding sites for [125I]SP were identified using autoradiography in slide-mounted frozen tissue sections, and their specificity determined with competition binding studies. RESULTS: In bladder homogenate binding studies, low affinity SP binding sites for [3H]SP were found both in normal and inflamed tissue, whereas high affinity binding sites were found in inflamed bladder tissue only. Based on autoradiographic studies, high affinity binding appeared to be to small blood vessels, and to be specific for substance P, a pharmacology consistent with the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R). CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of NK1R may be part of the pathophysiology of IC, as it is in some other inflammatory diseases. If so, more specifically targeted therapies for IC may become available.",M1
9667822,"Substance P receptor immunodetection in the spinal cord: comparative use of direct anti-receptor antibody and anti-complementary peptide antibody.The immunolocalization of substance P (SP) receptors was compared in the rat spinal cord using either a direct anti-substance P NK1-receptor antibody (anti-<e>SPR</e>) or an anti-complementary peptide antibody (anti-CP). The first antibody recognizes an intracellular epitope, the C-terminal tail of the NK1-receptor. The second antibody recognizes an extracellular epitope located at or near the ligand-binding domain because anti-CP antibody and SP were previously shown to compete for binding to the receptor. At the light microscope level, it was observed that anti-CP antibody labels both laminae I and II of the dorsal horn, while anti-SPR antibody labels exclusively lamina I, except at the lumbar level. This could suggest that spinal NK1 receptors are heterogeneous. Anti-SPR antibodies may recognize an NK1 receptor subclass confined to lamina I. Conversely, anti-CP antibody may recognize either another receptor subclass or two different subclasses present in laminae I and II. At the electron microscope level, labeling was localized either on the intracellular or the extracellular face of the plasma membrane depending on the location of the epitope recognized by both antibodies on the transmembrane receptor. However, using either antibody, the ultrastructural labeling was found at non-junctional sites, suggesting that SP may act in a non-synaptic manner on all putative receptor subclasses.",M1
9654151,"Human substance P receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells directly activates G(alpha q/11), G(alpha s), G(alpha o).Substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stimulates at least three second messenger systems including phosphoinositide hydrolysis, cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation, and arachidonic acid release. Whether these second messenger systems are activated via single or multiple G proteins is not known. Therefore, in the present study we examined whether human SPR (hSPR) stably expressed in CHO cells activates multiple G proteins. This was achieved by photoaffinity labeling of G(alpha)-subunits with [32P]azidoanilido-GTP ([32P]AA-GTP) upon hSPR stimulation in CHO-hSPR membranes followed by immunoprecipitation of the labeled G(alpha)-subunits with antibodies specific for various G(alpha)-subunits. These experiments reveal that hSPR directly activates G(alpha q/11), G(alpha s) and G(alpha o). While hSPR is known to couple G(alpha q/11), the present study provides the first evidence that hSPR can also activate G(alpha s) and G(alpha o) in a mammalian system.",M1

After injection of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the nucleus of the solitary tract, FG-labeled neurons showing SPR-LI were mainly seen in lamina I of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns, lamina V and the lateral spinal nucleus of the spinal cord. The present results suggest that the trigeminal and spinal neurons with SPR-LI, especially those in lamina I may be involved in the transmission of somatic and/or visceral nociceptive information from the medullary and spinal dorsal horns to the nucleus of the solitary tract.",M1
9477943,"Characterization of GRK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of the human substance P receptor in Sf9 membranes.G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), resulting in GPCR desensitization. GRK2 is one of the better studied of the six known GRKs and phosphorylates several GPCRs. In a previous study, we documented that GRK2 and GRK3 phosphorylate purified and reconstituted rat substance P receptor (rSPR) [Kwatra et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9161-9164]. Here, we characterize in detail GRK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of human <e>SPR</e> (hSPR) in intact membranes. GRK2 phosphorylates hSPR in urea-washed Sf9 membranes in an agonist-dependent manner with a stoichiometry of 19 +/- 1 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor, which increases slightly (1.3-fold increase) in the presence of G beta gamma. Kinetic analyses indicate that receptor phosphorylation occurs with a Km of 6.3 +/- 0.4 nM and a Vmax of 1.8 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/mg; these kinetic parameters are only slightly affected by G beta gamma [Km = 3.6 +/- 1.0 nM and Vmax = 2.2 +/- 0.2 nmol/min/mg]. The lack of a strong stimulatory effect of G beta gamma on GRK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of hSPR is surprising since G beta gamma potently stimulates GRK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin. Involvement of G beta gamma endogenously present in membranes is ruled out as a source of high levels of hSPR phosphorylation, since receptor phosphorylation was not affected by guanine nucleotides that suppress or enhance the release of endogenous G beta gamma. The present study determines, for the first time, the kinetics of phosphorylation of a receptor substrate of GRK2 in intact membranes. Further, our results identify hSPR as a unique substrate of GRK2 whose phosphorylation is strong even in the absence of G beta gamma.",M1
9484906,"17beta-estradiol stimulates substance P receptor gene expression.The actions of substance P (SP), a widely distributed tachykinin neuropeptide, are mediated by the NK1 receptor, a seven trans-membrane spanning domain cell surface receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins. SP regulates cellular processes in the CNS, placenta and vasculature including permeability, inflammation, mitogenesis and transformation. Examples of sexual dimorphism in tissue distribution and expression of SP and the SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in various organ systems (breast, uterus, brain) suggest the SPR may be under hormonal control. Using Northern blot analysis of SPR mRNA levels, we studied the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on SPR gene expression in AR42J (rat pancreatic acinar) cells which constitutively express high levels of SPR. E2 (100 nM) led to a 2.5-fold increase in SPR mRNA levels (4.7 kb band) which was time- and concentration-dependent. The increase was inhibited by the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D (5 microg/ml) but not by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (10 microg/ml). In addition, the antiestrogen tamoxifen (1 microM) blocked the stimulatory effect of E2 on SPR mRNA. Increased SPR mRNA levels in response to E2 were linearly related to increased [3H]SP binding to the SPR. This study has implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of hormonal control of receptor gene expression.",M1
9368840,"Collateral projections from striatonigral neurons to substance P receptor-expressing intrinsic neurons in the striatum of the rat.It is well known that striatonigral neurons produce substance P (SP); however, no SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) has so far been found in the substantia nigra. On the other hand, a previous study in the rat striatum indicated that SPR was expressed only in cholinergic or somatostatinergic intrinsic neurons (Kaneko et al. [1993] Brain Res. 631:297-303). Thus, it was assumed that SP produced by striatonigral neurons might be released through their intrastriatal axon collaterals to act upon intrinsic neurons in the striatum. To confirm this assumption, the distribution of axon collaterals of striatonigral neurons was examined in the striatum of the rat. The experiments were performed on brain slices by combining retrograde labeling with tetramethylrhodamine-dextran amine, electrophysiological recording, intracellular staining with biocytin, and immunocytochemistry for SPR. The distribution of axons of cholinergic striatal neurons (a group of SP-negative intrinsic striatal neurons) was also examined. It was observed that 16% of varicosities of intrastriatal axon collaterals of striatonigral neurons, as well as 6% of axonal varicosities of cholinergic neurons, were in close apposition to dendrites and cell bodies of SPR-immunoreactive striatal neurons. Since SPR-immunoreactive striatal neurons constituted only 2.7% of the total population of striatal neurons (Kaneko et al. [1993] Brain Res. 631:297-303), it appeared that axonal varicosities of striatonigral neurons were preferentially apposed to SPR-immunoreactive striatal neurons and that the varicosities in close apposition to SPR-immunoreactive neurons were derived more frequently from striatonigral neurons than from cholinergic interneurons. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that axonal varicosities in close apposition to SPR-immunoreactive cells showed synaptophysin immunoreactivity, a marker of synaptic vesicles. In intrastriatal axons of striatonigral neurons, it was further revealed from electron microscopy that axonal varicosities in close apposition to SPR-immunoreactive dendrites, at least a part of them, made synapses of the symmetric type. Striatonigral neurons might release SP preferentially around cholinergic or somatostatinergic intrinsic neurons to regulate them through SP-SPR interactions.",M1
9220368,"Substance P receptor expression and cellular responses to substance P in prenatal rat spinal cord cells.Substance P receptors (<e>SPRs</e>) are expressed by prenatal rat spinal cord neurons and glial cells early in their differentiation, and SPRs may mediate developmental influences in the developing spinal cord. In order to understand better early SPR expression, we quantified SPR mRNA in the rat spinal cord during prenatal development using a cDNA probe for the rat SPR in nuclease protection assays. SPR mRNA was present in the rat spinal cord at E14, the earliest stage examined, and the presence of specific binding sites for radiolabeled SP suggested that SPRs were expressed at the protein level as well. Comparisons of samples from rats at different prenatal ages showed that the relative abundance of SPR mRNA declined by about 75% from E14 through the remainder of prenatal development. Assays of the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol performed on prenatal spinal cord cells in culture revealed that SP caused a small but significant stimulation. These results show that expression of SPRs is an early molecular event in the development of the rat spinal cord in vivo and that SPRs on young spinal cord cells can mediate functional responses at early developmental stages.",M1
9372527,"Effect of UVB 311 nm irradiation on normal human skin.Ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) on the skin induces erythema, inflammation and modifications of the immune system. These changes have been reported after excessive short-term or long-term exposure to broad spectrum UVB. In this study, we examined the effects of local repetitive UVB irradiation of 311 nm wavelength on the skin of seven young volunteers. Skin biopsies were taken before and after UVB irradiation, and we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of CD1a and HLA-DR antigens of Langerhans cells (LC), the possible infiltration of dermis/epidermis by CD11b macrophages, the modifications or the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) involved in the binding of leukocytes to the endothelial surface and the development of perivascular infiltrates of LFA-1+ mononuclear cells. We also determined the expression of substance P receptors (<e>SPR</e>) using biotinylated substance P (SPB). Exposure of UVB 311 nm induced a drastic reduction of CD1a+ cells and a moderate increase of HLA-DR+ dendritic cells in the epidermis without infiltration by CD11b macrophages. An increase of the binding of SPB to upper layer epidermal cells was noted in five of seven biopsies. In the dermis, vessel-associated ICAM-1 expression increased and an induction of E-selectin occurred on nearly 20 to 40% of endothelial cells, but VCAM-1 expression remained undetectable. The percentage of LFA-1+ cells did not change significantly after irradiation. These observations may be compatible with a selective role of UVB 311 nm on the skin immune response.",M1
9483197,"Mucosal substance P receptor expression in HIV infection and inflammatory bowel disease.Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is a common manifestation of HIV infection. Symptoms may result from the acquisition of intestinal infection, but in certain cases functional and mucosal abnormality may result from mucosal HIV infection. The pathogenesis of HIV enteropathy is poorly understood, but a range of neuroenteric disturbances has been described including a reduction in mucosal substance P (SP). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a generic term used to describe two major clinical entities; Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dysregulation of mucosal neuropeptide expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD and UC. Mucosal SP expression has been variously described as increased, normal or reduced in intestinal tissue from patients with IBD. In contrast, uniform increases in mucosal SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) have been described in patients with IBD using quantitative autoradiography. The purpose of this study was to characterize intestinal mucosal SPR mRNA expression in control, HIV and IBD patients using semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR. Intestinal tissue was obtained during diagnostic colonoscopy from 7 control, 9 HIV-infected and 28 (12 CD and 16 UC) IBD patients. RNA was isolated from the tissue biopsies, reverse transcribed and amplified with primers specific for SPR. SPR mRNA expression was detected in 7/7 (100%) of control, 2/9 (22%) of HIV-infected, 12/12 (100%) of CD and 11/16 (69%) of UC intestinal biopsies. These data demonstrate that SPR mRNA expression is significantly reduced in patients with HIV infection. Reduced mucosal SPR expression may contribute to the mucosal abnormality, altered intestinal motility and GI symptoms associated with HIV infection.",M1
9034907,"Distribution of trigeminohypothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons displaying substance P receptor-like immunoreactivity in the rat.Primary afferent neurons containing substance P (SP) are apparently implicated in the transmission of noxious information from the periphery to the central nervous system, and SP released from primary afferent neurons acts on second-order neurons with the SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>). In the rat, nociceptive information reached the hypothalamus not only through indirect pathways but also directly through trigeminohypothalamic and spinohypothalamic pathways. Thus, in the present study, the distribution pattern of trigeminohypothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons showing SPR-like immunoreactivity (SPR-LI) was examined in the rat by a retrograde tract-tracing method combined with immunofluorescence histochemistry for SPR. A substantial number of trigeminal and spinal neurons with SPR-LI were retrogradely labeled with Fluoro-Gold (FG) injected into the hypothalamic regions. These neurons were distributed mainly in lamina I of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns, lateral spinal nucleus, regions around the central canal of the spinal cord, and the lateral aspect of the deep part of the spinal dorsal horn. A number of SPR-LI neurons in the spinal parasympathetic nucleus were labeled with FG injected into the area around the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Some SPR-LI neurons in the lateral spinal nucleus and the lateral aspect of the deep part of the spinal dorsal horn were also labeled with FG injected into the septal region. On the basis of the distribution areas of SPR-LI trigeminal and spinal neurons projecting to the hypothalamic and septal regions, it is likely that these neurons are involved in the transmission of somatic and/or visceral noxious information.",M1
9034894,"Immunostaining for substance P receptor labels GABAergic cells with distinct termination patterns in the hippocampus.A specific antiserum against substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) labels nonprincipal neurons in the cerebral cortex of the rat (T. Kaneko et al. [1994], Neuroscience 60:199-211; Y. Nakaya et al. [1994], J. Comp. Neurol. 347:249-274). In the present study, we aimed to identify the types of SPR-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus according to their content of neurochemical markers, which label interneuron populations with distinct termination patterns. Markers for perisomatic inhibitory cells, parvalbumin and cholecystokinin (CCK), colocalized with SPR in pyramidallike basket cells in the dentate gyrus and in large multipolar or bitufted cells within all hippocampal subfields respectively. A dense meshwork of SPR-immunoreactive spiny dendrites in the hilus and stratum lucidum of the CA3 region belonged largely to inhibitory cells terminating in the distal dendritic region of granule cells, as indicated by the somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) content. In addition, SPR and NPY were colocalized in numerous multipolar interneurons with dendrites branching close to the soma. Twenty-five percent of the SPR-immunoreactive cells overlapped with calretinin-positive neurons in all hippocampal subfields, showing that interneurons specialized to contact other gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic cells may also contain SPR. On the basis of the known termination pattern of the colocalized markers, we conclude that SPR-positive interneurons are functionally heterogeneous and participate in different inhibitory processes: (1) perisomatic inhibition of principal cells (CCK-containing cells, and parvalbumin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus), (2) feedback dendritic inhibition in the entorhinal termination zone (somatostatin and NPY-containing cells), and (3) innervation of other interneurons (calretinin-containing cells).",M1
8898641,"Substance P activation of enteric neurons in response to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Nerves have been suggested to mediate the effects of bacterial toxins in intestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. This study examined endogenous substance P (SP) activation of the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) on enteric neurons in the rat ileum after exposure to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A. METHODS: After intraluminal injection of toxin A in ileal loops, tissue was examined for pathological changes by histology and for SPR activation by immunocytochemical analysis of SP-induced SPR endocytosis. RESULTS: After toxin A administration, &gt; 70% of enteric neurons showed SPR endocytosis and became swollen with thickened dendrites. In contrast, SPRs in control rats were largely confined to the plasma membrane. Rats denervated of primary afferent fibers with neonatal capsaicin injection and animals pretreated with a nonpeptide SPR antagonist showed few endosomal SPRs, and the pathological inflammatory effects of toxin A were ablated. CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal toxin A causes the release of SP from primary afferent neurons: this endogenous SP then acts on enteric neurons in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. SP is the primary mediator of an axon reflex mediating neurogenic inflammation in the intestine. SPR blockade may prove to be a novel therapy used to prevent intestinal inflammation.",M1
8873981,"Patchy distribution of substance P receptor immunoreactivity in the' developing rat striatum.Developmental changes of the distribution pattern of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) were investigated immunohistochemically in the rat striatum. The SPR immunoreactivity in the striatum first emerged at postnatal day 1 and transiently showed a patchy pattern of distribution until it displayed the adult pattern of homogeneous distribution by the third postnatal week. The SPR-immunoreactivity patches were most marked in the medial and dorsolateral parts of the striatum, as well as in the subcallosal streak. They matched tyrosine hydroxylase-enriched areas and, conversely, avoided calbindin-enriched zones. No neurons within the SPR-immunoreactive patches contained either choline acetyltransferase or somatostatin, which is known to be contained in intrinsic neurons in the striatum. The vast majority of SPR-immunoreactive patch neurons also contained DARPP-32, a phosphoprotein that is expressed in striatal projection neurons with D1 dopamine receptor. The results indicate that SPR-immunoreactive patches which appear transiently in the developing striatum are in register with the striatal patch compartment, and that SPR immunoreactivity within these patches may be expressed on projection neurons rather than intrinsic neurons. Such SPR immunoreactivity in projection neurons in striatal patches may fade out in adulthood.",M1

As a step towards this end, immunocytochemical methods were used to identify the NK-1 receptors (<e>SPR</e>) in rat tongue. SPR-IR was found in the basolateral membranes of taste cells in fungiform, circumvallate and foliate papillae. SPR-IR was not found in the dorsal epithelium or in any structure that could be clearly identified as a neuron.

8723708,"Distribution and neurochemical character of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)-immunoreactive striatal neurons of the macaque monkey: accumulation of SP fibers and SPR neurons and dendrites in  striocapsules  encircling striosomes.The striatal distribution of the substance P receptor (SPR) protein was examined in relation to its ligand, the neuro-peptide SP, as well as to the neurochemical and compartmental composition of the neostriatum in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in immunohistochemical experiments. About 2% of striatal neurons, displaying varicose, virtually spine-free dendrites characteristic of large and medium-sized aspiny interneurons, expressed SPR immunoreactivity. SPR/choline acetyltransferase, SPR/somatostatin, SPR/GABA, SPR/calbindin D28k, and SPR/parvalbumin double immunolabeling experiments demonstrated that SPR-positive cells are either cholinergic or somatostatinergic. Comparison of SP and SPR immunoreactivities in double-labeled and adjacent single-labeled sections revealed compartment-specific match and mismatch between the densities of the peptide and receptor. A matching high density of SP fibers and SPR cells and dendrites was only observed in the rim of the striosome compartments. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for an anatomical border comprised of dendritic processes that separate striatal compartments. We have termed these zones  striocapsules,  because they encircle and encapsulate striosomal cell islands. In the striatal matrix, an abundance of SPR-labeled profiles was complemented with light SP staining. By contrast, in the core of the striosomes, SPR labeling was sparse and SP staining intense. SP-positive axon-like puncta frequently contacted SPR-positive dendrites in all striatal compartments. The SP receptor/ligand match indicates a sharp increase in the efficacy of SP action in the striocapsules, and suggests that the influence of SP might be heightened in this striatal subcompartment.",M1
8723707,"Presynaptic and postsynaptic subcellular localization of substance P receptor immunoreactivity in the neostriatum of the rat and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).The substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) gene is expressed at high levels in basal ganglia, but the paucity of information about localization of the encoded receptor protein has limited our understanding of this peptide's involvement in cellular and subcellular mechanisms in this region. Morphological evidence in the rodent striatum indicates that SPRs are expressed in postsynaptic neuronal elements, while pharmacological studies suggest the existence of presynaptic SPRs in this structure. We have examined the issue of subcellular distribution of this receptor protein in rat and primate neostriatal tissue, employing an antiserum raised against SPR. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that SPR immunoreactivity is present in presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal elements in both species. In agreement with earlier studies, SPR immunoreactivity was found predominantly in perikarya and dendrites of a small subset of striatal neurons, the large and medium-sized aspiny interneurons. In addition, a small but significant proportion of the immunoreaction product was localized in presynaptic profiles, both in axons and axon terminals. The majority of SPR immunoreactive boutons formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites and dendritic spines. The association of SPRs with asymmetric synapses provides a morphological substrate for peptidergic modulation of excitatory neurotransmission of extrastriatal origin. A minor proportion of immunolabeled axons established symmetric synaptic junctions with unlabeled dendrites. The presence of SPRs in these synapses suggests a presynaptic peptidergic modulation of intrinsic striatal transmitter systems. The observations in this study also indicate that SPR mediates a complex combination of postsynaptic and presynaptic effects on acetylcholine release in the mammalian striatum.",M1

METHODS: Substance P, [DTPA-Arg1]SP and [3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl-Arg1]SP (Bolton-Hunter-SP, [BH-SP]) were tested as competitors for 125I-BH-SP to SPR in rat brain cortex membranes. An autoradiographic displacement study of the submandibular gland of the rat with the 125I-BH-SP as radioligand and [DTPA-Arg1]SP as competitor was performed. Tissue distribution and ex vivo autoradiography were studied in rats, with and without pretreatment with the selective nonpeptide antagonist CP96,345 to quantify specific binding. In vivo metabolism of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]SP was performed in control rats. Gamma-camera scintigraphic studies were carried out with control rats to visualize the SPR+ salivary glands in rats bearing the SPR+ transplantable pancreatic tumor CA20948 and in rats with SPR+ adjuvant arthritic joints, which was induced after injection of a homogenate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: Substance P, [DTPA-Arg1]SP and BH-SP dose-dependently inhibited binding of 125I-BH-SP to SPR in rat brain cortex membranes with IC50 values of 0.2, 4 and 2 nM, respectively. In an autoradiographic displacement study of the submandibular gland with 125I-BH-SP as radioligand, an IC50 of 2.7 nM was found for [DTPA-Arg1]SP. In vivo metabolism of the radiopharmaceutical in the rat revealed a renal clearance rate of 50% of the injected radioactive dose in 30 min and a rapid enzymatic degradation of the radiopharmaceutical, resulting in an effective half-life of the intact radiopharmaceutical in blood of approximately 3 min. Tissue distribution and ex vivo autoradiographic studies in rats showed uptake and specific binding of radioactivity in isolated tumors and submandibular and parotid glands. Optimum SPR+ target-to-background ratios were found 24 hr after injection of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]SP. Visualization of normal SPR+ tissues, such as the salivary glands by gamma camera scintigraphy, after administration of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]SP was demonstrated in untreated rats. Pathological SPR+ processes were visualized both in rats bearing the transplantable pancreatic tumor CA20948 and in those with adjuvant mycobacteria tuberculosis-induced arthritic joints. CONCLUSION: [Indium-111-DTPA-Arg1]SP can be used successfully to visualize SPR+ processes in vivo by gamma camera scintigraphy.",M1
8581503,"A relationship between substance P receptor and retinal fibers in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus controls many of the circadian rhythms in mammalian species. In the present study, we investigated the location of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>)-containing neurons in the rat SCN, using a specific antibody against SPR, which corresponds to the NK-1 subtype of tachykinin receptors, and also examined the synaptic relationship between SPR-containing neurons and retinal fibers at the ultrastructural level. An SPR-immunoreactive meshwork of labeled somata and dendrites was identified in the SCN. The strongest SPR-immunoreactivity was observed in the dorsal and lateral parts of the SCN. Many labeled somata were identified there and their dendrites protruded ventrally from their somata. A few SPR-immunoreactive somata were observed also in the ventral part of the SCN and within the optic tract. In the SCN of eye-enucleated animals, degenerating retinal fibers were shown to terminate on SPR-immunoreactive dendrites forming asymmetrical axo-dendritic contacts.",M1

These neurons were distributed mainly in lamina I, and additionally in lamina III.",M1

8552274,"Synaptic organization and ultrastructural features of the substance P-receptor-like immunoreactive neurons in the nucleus intermediolateralis of rats.Synaptic and ultrastructural organization in the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) of rat were investigated with electron microscopy combined with pre-embedding immunohistochemistry for substance P (SP)-receptor (<e>SPr</e>). SPr immunoreactivity in IML was found in the vicinity of the cellular membrane of the perikarya and dendritic profiles of the small sized neurons, ranging from 15 to 25 microns in length. A SPr-immunoreactive (SPr-ir) soma had symmetric or asymmetric synaptic contacts with three to five unlabeled axon terminals. Two different types of axon terminals made synapses on the SPr soma, one contained 20-30 nm pleomorphic vesicles and large dense cored vesicles and the other contained clear pleomorphic vesicles of 30-50 nm in size. Occasionally, SPr-ir dendrites are very closely apposed to the blood capillary. Our present results suggested the possibility that the IML SPr-ir neurons might be activated by several kinds of synaptic inputs and SP provided from blood flow.",M1
7583237,"LIF-and IL-1 beta-mediated increases in substance P receptor mRNA in axotomized, explanted or dissociated sympathetic ganglia.Regulation of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) mRNA was examined in the rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in vitro and in vivo after axotomy. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) treatment of explanted ganglia elevated levels of SPR mRNA. By contrast, dissociated cultures of purified sympathetic neurons, purified fibroblasts, and purified Schwann cells each expressed only low levels of SPR mRNA, and treatment with the cytokine did not alter levels of the receptor mRNA. Treatment of Schwann cell or fibroblast cultures with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) also did not alter SPR mRNA. However, treatment of pure neuronal cultures with LIF significantly elevated levels of the receptor mRNA. Further, SPR mRNA increased in pure sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence of conditioned medium from IL-1 beta treated fibroblasts or Schwann cells; this effect was blocked in the presence of LIF antibody. This suggests that the stimulatory effects of IL-1 beta on SPR mRNA in explants is mediated by LIF release. Axotomy of the SCG in vivo resulted in a significant increase in LIF mRNA. Further, axotomy resulted in a significant increase in SPR mRNA, suggesting that LIF may mediate the increase in SPR mRNA. In view of the known effects of substance P (SP) on inflammatory responses, these observations suggest that coordinated expression of SP and SPR mRNA in neurons after nerve injury may participate in inflammatory and repair processes in the ganglion.",M1
7891090,"Functional wild-type and carboxyl-terminal-tagged rat substance P receptors expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells.The rat substance P (SP) receptor (<e>SPR</e>) was expressed in insect Sf9 cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus. The receptor bound SP with high affinity (KD = 360 pM) and had a rank order of affinity of SP &gt; neurokinin A &gt; neurokinin B. Ligand activation of the receptor resulted in an increase in both inositol lipid hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). However, high-level expression of the receptor, in the absence of ligand, was correlated with increased basal turnover of inositol lipids and an elevated rate of Ca2+ influx. These results demonstrate that the Sf9 cells provide a suitable environment for the high-level expression of a functionally active SPR. Two carboxy-terminal epitope-tagged receptors (SPR-KT3 = SPR-TPPPEPET, COOH; SPR-Glu = SPR-EEEEYMPME, COOH) were also expressed. The affinity of the KT3-tagged receptor for ligand was similar to that of the wild-type receptor (KD = 405 pM), and that of the Glu-tagged receptor was slightly lower (KD = 1,082 pM). The high-affinity SP binding site of all three receptors was sensitive to guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) pretreatment. The maximal signal-transducing ability of the epitope-tagged receptors was comparable to that of the wild-type receptor ([Ca2+]i rise as a percentage of wild-type: SPR-KT3, 80-100%; SPR-Glu, 88-100%). These data show that heterologous expression in the baculovirus system results in high expression of functional wild-type and tagged receptors.",M1
7537460,"Immunochemical localization of type I VIP receptor and NK-1-type substance P receptor in rat lung.Peptidergic nerves in the respiratory tract release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and substance P (SP), which mediate physiological and immune functions. Antipeptide antibodies to type I VIP receptor (VIPR) and NK-1-type SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) were used to identify these receptors in normal rat lungs. VIPRs and SPRs were detected on airway epithelium from the trachea to the respiratory bronchioles but not in alveoli, submucosal glands, or pulmonary smooth muscle, except for that of some pulmonary veins. VIPRs also were expressed on macrophages around capillaries, in tracheal and bronchial connective tissue, in alveolar walls, and in the subintima of pulmonary veins and some arterioles. The absence of receptors from airway smooth muscle and submucosal glands implies that mediation of some known effects of SP and VIP may be epithelial or macrophage dependent. Other types of VIPRs and SPRs on airway glands and smooth muscle may transduce direct effects. The similar localization of VIPRs and SPRs in rat lung suggests that VIP and SP may coordinately regulate some pulmonary functions.",M1
7535928,"Rapid endocytosis of a G protein-coupled receptor: substance P evoked internalization of its receptor in the rat striatum in vivo.Studies on cultured cells have shown that agonists induce several types of G protein-coupled receptors to undergo internalization. We have investigated this phenomenon in rat striatum, using substance P (SP)-induced internalization of the SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) as our model system. Within 1 min of a unilateral striatal injection of SP in the anesthetized rat, nearly 60% of the SPR-immunoreactive neurons within the injection zone display massive internalization of the SPR--i.e., 20-200 SPR+ endosomes per cell body. Within the dendrites the SPR undergoes a striking translocation from the plasma membrane to endosomes, and these dendrites also undergo a morphological reorganization, changing from a structure of rather uniform diameter to one characterized by large, swollen varicosities connected by thin fibers. In both cell bodies and dendrites the number of SPR+ endosomes returns to baseline within 60 min of SP injection. The number of neurons displaying substantial endosomal SPR internalization is dependent on the concentration of injected SP, and the SP-induced SPR internalization is inhibited by the nonpeptide neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist RP-67,580. These data demonstrate that in the central nervous system in vivo, SP induces a rapid and widespread SPR internalization in the cell bodies and dendrites and a structural reorganization of the dendrites. These results suggest that many of the observations that have been made on the internalization and recycling of G protein-coupled receptors in in vitro transfected cell systems are applicable to similar events that occur in the mammalian central nervous system in vivo.",M1
7605934,"Striatal neurones displaying substance P (NK1) receptor immunoreactivity in human and non-human primates.The striatum of normal human subjects and that of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) was found to contain two distinct types of neurones displaying immunoreactivity for substance P (neurokinin-1) receptor (<e>SPR</e>). Large and medium-sized SPR-immunoreactive neurones, both with aspiny dendrites, were fairly uniformly distributed in the striatum of humans and squirrel monkeys. In humans the proportions of large and medium-sized SPR-positive neurones were 57.2% and 42.8% in putamen, compared with 51.9% and 48.1% in caudate nucleus. These findings suggest that substance P exerts its local influence not only on large cholinergic neurones, as commonly believed, but also on a subset of medium-sized interneurones in the striatum of human and non-human primates.",M1
7796113,"Spinoparabrachial tract neurons showing substance P receptor-like immunoreactivity in the lumbar spinal cord of the rat.By using substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) immunofluorescence histochemistry combined with fluorescent retrograde labeling, SPR-like immunoreactive (SPR-LI) neurons sending their axons to the lateral parabrachial region were observed in the lumbar spinal cord of the rat. After injection of Fluoro-Gold into the lateral parabrachial region, retrogradely labeled neurons with SPR-LI were seen frequently in lamina I and the lateral spinal nucleus, and occasionally in laminae IV and V, with a predominantly contralateral distribution. Some of these neurons, especially those in lamina I, may convey nociceptive information to the lateral parabrachial region.",M1
7978889,"Rat pancreatic AR42J cells. Amphicrine cells as an in vitro model to study peptide hormone receptor regulation.The rat pancreatic acinar tumor cell line, AR42J, is widely used to study pancreatic acinar cell biology and biochemistry. In addition to the well-documented exocrine cell features, we have identified by immunofluorescence and by electron microscopy the co-expression of small neuroendocrine (NE) vesicles using the NE vesicle-specific markers synaptophysin and  protein S.V.2.  AR24J cells store [3H]GABA, which is secreted upon potassium depolarization in a calcium-dependent manner. In addition, we found the expression of the receptor for the neurotransmitter substance P by using a receptor-specific cDNA probe. Glucocorticoid treatment, which profoundly inhibits cellular growth and induces differentiation, results in a rapid decrease of substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) gene expression as assessed by Northern blot analysis. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was then determined in response to substance P in control cells and glucocorticoid-pretreated cells by dual wavelength spectrophotometry using fura-2 in single cells. Glucocorticoid-mediated down-regulation of substance P receptors resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by substance P. In summary, these data indicate that AR42J cells display an amphicrine phenotype with two differentially regulated secretory pathways; during glucocorticoid-induced differentiation, the cells become less sensitive to substance P stimulation as a consequence of reduced gene expression of the substance P receptor.",M1
7814667,"Immunohistochemical localization of substance P receptor in the central nervous system of the adult rat.In an attempt to reveal the function sites of substance P (SP) in the central nervous system (CNS), the distribution of SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) was immunocytochemically investigated in adult rat and compared with that of SP-positive fibers. SPR-like immunoreactivity (LI) was mostly localized to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Neurons with intense SPR-LI were distributed densely in the cortical amygdaloid nucleus, hilus of the dentate gyrus, locus ceruleus, rostral half of the ambiguus nucleus, and intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic cord; moderately in the caudatoputamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, median, pontine, and magnus raphe nuclei, laminae I and III of the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and lamina I of the spinal cord; and sparsely in the cerebral cortex, basal nucleus of Meynert, claustrum, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and lobules IX and X of the cerebellar vermis. Neurons with weak to moderate SPR-LI were distributed more widely throughout the CNS. The regional patterns of distribution of SPR-LI were not necessarily the same as those of SP-positive fibers. The entopedunucular nucleus, substantia nigra, and lateral part of the interpeduncular nucleus showed intense SP-LI but displayed almost no SPR-LI. Conversely, the hilus of the dentate gyrus, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, and dorsal tegmental nucleus showed intense to moderate SPR-LI but contained few axons with SP-LI. These findings confirmed the presence of the  mismatch  problem between SP and SPR localizations. However, the distribution of SPR-LI was quite consistent with that of the SP-binding activity, which has been studied via autoradiography. This indicates that the sites of SPR-LI revealed in the present study represent most, if not all, sites of SP-binding activity.",M1
7519157,"mRNAs encoding muscarinic and substance P receptors in cultured sympathetic neurons are differentially regulated by LIF or CNTF.Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) have previously been shown to regulate neuronal choice of neurotransmitter. In this present study, these factors were shown to specifically and differentially regulate levels of both muscarinic (subtypes m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5) and substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) mRNAs in sympathetic neurons of the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) using solution hybridization/RNase protection analysis. In vivo, neonatal rat SCG expressed predominantly m2 (10.31 +/- 0.43 pg mRNA/micrograms total RNA) and some m1 (1.54 +/- 0.84 pg/microgram) muscarinic receptor mRNA, which increased developmentally to adult levels (m2 mRNA levels being 60% higher than those in neonates). By contrast, m3, m4, and m5 subtype mRNAs were much less abundant at all time points measured. A similar developmental regulation was found in dissociated SCG neurons in vitro. After 16 days in culture, m2 mRNA increased 334% to 15.76 +/- 0.68 pg/microgram, while m1 mRNA changed little (2.03 +/- 1.00 pg/microgram). However, LIF or CNTF treatment (5 ng/ml, 14 days) in sister cultures completely blocked this developmental increase. Further, LIF treatment blocked the normal muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in intracellular calcium (fura-2 imaging), indicating a functional change in receptor phenotype. By contrast, levels of SPR mRNA, which were low in untreated cultures (0.037 +/- 0.025 pg SPR mRNA/microgram total RNA), were elevated by LIF or CNTF treatment, to 0.866 +/- 0.034 pg/microgram and 0.662 +/- 0.148 pg/microgram, respectively. These observations indicate that muscarinic and SPR receptor expression are differentially regulated by the same factors in SCG neurons and that neuronal choice of receptor phenotype may be, at least in part, specifically regulated by cytokines/growth factors in the cellular milieu.",M1
7518397,"Attenuation of agonist-induced desensitization of the rat substance P receptor by progressive truncation of the C-terminus.We have investigated the C-terminal tail of the rat substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) as a domain essential for agonist-induced desensitization. Four progressively shorter mutants, using premature termination in the C-terminus, were constructed and compared with the unaltered SPR using ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant receptors in Xenopus oocytes. These mutants were designated D16, D47, D70 and D96 with 16, 47, 70 and 96 amino acids residues deleted from the tail, respectively. Wild type SPR, D16 and D47 exhibited normal current responses when challenged with substance P, but D70 and D96 had reduced maximal current responses (70% and 5% of wild type SPR, respectively). D70, however, exhibited substantial resistance to substance P-induced desensitization in that 55%, versus 8% for wild type SPR, of the peak current of the first response was preserved on second challenge with substance P. Therefore, a domain from residues 338 to 360 of the rat SPR, though not necessary for the functional activity of the receptor, plays an essential role in agonist-induced desensitization.",M1
7514869,"Interactions between neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and the substance P (NK1) receptor expressed in mammalian cells.Interactions between neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP) and the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>; NK1) were investigated by examining substance P (SP) degradation, SP binding and SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in epithelial cells transfected with cDNA encoding the rat SPR and rat NEP. Expression of NEP accelerated the degradation of SP by intact epithelial cells and by membrane preparations, and degradation was reduced by the NEP inhibitor thiorphan. In cells expressing SPR alone, specific 125I-SP binding after 20 min incubation at 37 degrees C was 92.2 +/- 3.1% of maximal binding and was unaffected by thiorphan. Coexpression of NEP in the same cells as the SPR markedly reduced SP binding to 13.9 +/- 0.5% of maximal, and binding was increased to 82.7 +/- 2.4% of maximal with thiorphan. Coexpression of NEP in the same cells as the SPR also reduced to undetectable the increase in intracellular Ca2+ in response to low concentrations of SP (0.3 and 0.5 nM), and significantly reduced the response to higher concentrations (1 and 3 nM). The Ca2+ response was restored to control values by inhibition of NEP with thiorphan. In contrast, SP binding and SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization were only slightly reduced when cells expressing SPR alone were mixed with a 3- to 24-fold excess of cells expressing NEP alone. Therefore, in this system, NEP markedly down-regulates SP binding and SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization only when coexpressed in the same cells as the SPR.",M1
7489329,"Stimulation of transcriptional regulatory activity by substance P.The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is one of the principal mediators of neurogenic inflammation as well as a neurotransmitter in nociceptive affect neurons. The mechanisms by which binding of SP to its receptor stimulates diverse downstream biologic effects remain unknown. In order to elucidate this process we have established stably transfected cell lines expressing functional rat SP receptors (KNRK-<e>SPR</e>). When stimulated by SP, KNRK-SPR cells respond by simultaneously mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ and increasing cAMP levels. To determine if SP stimulation activates downstream transcriptional regulatory factors, we transfected KNRK-SPR cells with plasmids containing the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and cAMP-responsive (CRE) enhancer elements coupled to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Stimulation with SP 1-1,000 nM caused a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in CAT activity in both AP-1-CAT- and CRE-CAT-transfected KNRK-SPR cells. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrate that the mechanism by which SP stimulates AP-1 enhancer activity involves increases in both c-jun mRNA and protein. Moreover, gel retardation assays with oligomers containing the AP-1 and CRE binding sites showed that SP induces specific retardation bands consistent with increases in AP-1 and CRE complexes. These experiments suggest that SP-mediated stimulation of cells involves the participation of two signaling pathways resulting in several transcriptional regulatory mechanisms being activated.",M1
7511591,"Characterization of the substance P receptor-mediated calcium influx in cDNA transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. A possible role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in calcium influx.In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the substance P (SP) receptor clone (CHO-<e>SPR</e> cells), we examined SP-stimulated [Ca2+]i changes by microscopic fluorescence analysis and electrophysiological recordings. In fura-2-loaded cells, SP (1 microM) induced a prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i, which comprised a rapid and transient Ca2+ mobilization and a prolonged phase of Ca2+ entry, but thrombin (1 unit/ml) induced only transient elevation of [Ca2+]i. The formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) was stimulated to 230% above the control by SP but 10% by thrombin 10 s after stimulation. In whole cell clamp recordings, SP induced a long lasting inward current, whereas thrombin did not evoke an inward current. Gq alpha antibody applied intracellularly blocked the SP-induced current, but GS alpha antibody did not block it. Furthermore, decavanadate and heparin, inhibitors of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to its receptor, suppressed the SP-induced current. In cell-attached patch, bath-applied SP activated channel currents carried by Ba2+, Ca2+, or Na+. In inside-out patches, Ins(1,4,5)P3, but neither inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate nor inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, activated channel currents carried by Ba2+, Ca2+, or Na+. The channel activity induced by Ins(1,4,5)P3 was abolished by heparin. These results demonstrate that SP induces Ca2+ entry through activation of cation channels and suggest that Ins(1,4,5)P3 may regulate both SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ entry in CHO-SPR cells.",M1
7508118,"Synaptic relationship between substance P and the substance P receptor: light and electron microscopic characterization of the mismatch between neuropeptides and their receptors.Light microscopic studies have demonstrated significant mismatches in the location of neuropeptides and their respective binding sites in the central nervous system. In the present study we used an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the substance P (SP) receptor (<e>SPR</e>) to further explore the relationship between a neuropeptide and its receptor. Light microscopy revealed an excellent correlation between the patterns of SPR immunoreactivity and of 125I-labeled SPR-binding sites in the central nervous system. The SPR appeared to be exclusively expressed by neurons; in fact, the SPR decorates the somatic and dendritic surface of neurons, producing Golgi-like images. Electron microscopic analysis in cortex, striatum, and spinal cord revealed that approximately 70% of the surface membrane of immunoreactive neurons is SPR laden. Simultaneous electron microscopic labeling of SP and SPR demonstrated significant mismatch at the synaptic level. Although some SP terminals contacted SPR-immunoreactive membrane, no more than 15% of the SPR-laden membrane apposed synaptic terminals. These results suggest that in contrast to more  classical  central and peripheral nervous system synapses, wherein the receptor immediately apposes the site of neurotransmitter storage and release, much of the surface of SPR-expressing neurons can be targeted by SP that diffuses a considerable distance from its site of release.",M1
7507985,"Characterization of antibodies to the rat substance P (NK-1) receptor and to a chimeric substance P receptor expressed in mammalian cells.Antibodies to neuropeptide receptors can be used to localize and characterize the receptors in tissues and cell lines. Two strategies were used to study the rat substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>, NK-1) by immunological methods. First, a polyclonal antiserum was raised by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the 15 amino acid residues (KTMTESSSFYSNMLA, SPR393-407) at the intracellular C-terminus of the rat SPR coupled to bovine thyroglobulin. An antiserum was obtained with a titer for half-maximal binding of 125I-SPR393-407 of 1:70,000. Nonradioactive SPR393-407 inhibited 50% of binding at a concentration of 10 pM. Binding of 125I-SPR393-407 to the antiserum was also displaced in a parallel manner by membrane proteins from tissues expressing high levels of the SPR (brain and submaxillary gland). Second, a chimeric SPR construct of a hydrophilic Flag peptide (DYKDDDDK) genetically engineered in sequence with the extracellular N-terminus of rat SPR was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The Flag-SPR chimera was expressed in rat kidney epithelial cells (KNRK) and judged to be fully functional, assessed by binding of 125I-substance P (apparent Kd of 5.63 nM) and calcium mobilization in response to substance P (EC50 of 0.66 nM). Antibodies to SPR393-407 and the Flag peptide stained the plasma membrane of KNRK cells expressing the native SPR or the Flag-SPR chimera. Staining was abolished by preincubation with SPR393-407 or the Flag peptide. Cells transfected with vector alone were unstained. The SPR antiserum recognized a broad protein band on Western blots of membranes prepared from cells expressing SPR but not from cells transfected with vector alone. The signal was quenched by preincubation of the antiserum with SPR393-407. By immunohistochemistry, the SPR antiserum was found to bind to neurons in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord and to ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the rat ileum near substance P-immunoreactive nerve fibers. Staining was abolished by preabsorption of the antiserum with SPR393-407. These antibodies can be used to localize the SPR in tissues and cells and to examine the function of the receptor in cell lines.",M1

A light and electron microscope study in the rat.The superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) have been known to contain many axons showing substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI). We, therefore, immunohistochemically examined the distribution of SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the superficial layers of the SC in the rat by using a specific antibody against SPR. The majority of SC neurons with SPR-LI were distributed in the zonal and the superficial gray layers, the rest of them were in the optic layer. Electron microscopy revealed that SPR-immunoreaction products in SC neurons were distributed not only in postsynaptic sites, but also in non-synaptic regions of perikaryal and dendritic profiles.",M1
7907524,"Substance P receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the rat neostriatum are segregated into somatostatinergic and cholinergic aspiny neurons.Immunochemical characteristics of neostriatal neurons producing substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) were examined in adult rats by double- and triple-immunofluorescence methods. In the neostriatum, SPR immunoreactivity was detected in large and medium-sized aspiny neurons. Virtually all SPR-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum contained somatostatin (SS) or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), but not parvalbumin. All SS- and ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum showed SPR immunoreactivity. The co-existence of SS and ChAT was, however, not found in single neurons expressing SPR immunoreactivity. The present results indicate that neostriatal neurons immunoreactive for SPR are segregated into 2 groups: (1) medium-sized, spiny somatostatinergic, and (2) large, aspiny cholinergic neurons.",M1
7683643,"The substance P receptor, which couples to Gq/11, is a substrate of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 and 2.The agonist-occupied forms of several G-protein-coupled receptors that modulate the activity of adenylycyclase via Gs (e.g. beta 2-adrenergic) or Gi (e.g. alpha 2-adrenergic and cardiac muscarinic) are phosphorylated by beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (beta ARK 1 and beta ARK 2). beta ARK-catalyzed phosphorylation of these receptors appears to correlate with their agonist-induced desensitization. The possibility that beta ARK isozymes may also be involved in the desensitization of other G-protein-coupled receptors such as those mediating phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis was tested by determining the phosphorylation of the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>), which is coupled to PI hydrolysis in numerous tissues. Rat SPR was expressed in Sf9 cells, partially purified, and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. The reconstituted SPR bound the SPR agonist substance P, 125I-labeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent, with low affinity. However, addition of purified Gq/11 to the reconstituted SPR resulted in the conversion of all the receptors to a high affinity state, suggesting that SPR couples to Gq/11. Phosphorylation of the reconstituted SPR with purified beta ARK 1 or 2 in the absence and presence of substance P (SP) was then studied. In the presence of 100 microM SP, both kinases promoted phosphorylation of the receptor to a stoichiometry of 9 +/- 2 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor. However, no phosphorylation of the receptor could be detected in the absence of agonist. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was blocked by coincubation with the SPR antagonist spantide. These results show that beta ARK isozymes may regulate the function of both adenylylcyclase as well as PI-coupled receptors, and suggest a role for beta ARK isozymes in SPR signal transduction.",M1

The antibody specifically reacted with SPR expressed in a mammalian cell line and rat striatum. Light and electron microscope analyses of the rat striatum revealed intense SPR-like immunoreactivity in neuronal somata and dendrites.

8150047,"Distribution of neurons expressing substance P receptor messenger RNA in immature and adult cat visual cortex.We have investigated the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) in the visual cortex of adult cats and 17-day-old kittens, using in situ hybridization histochemistry with two digoxigenin-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the SPR mRNA. In the adult cortex, a subset of large pyramidal neurons of layer V and layer III is heavily labeled. Other, mainly pyramidal neurons in layers II, III and V are less intensely labeled, but most neurons in these layers appear unlabeled. Neurons in layer IV and VI, and in the white matter do not show hybridization signals above background levels. In the 17-day-old kitten, SPR mRNA-expressing cells are confined to layer V and to the upper white matter (subplate zone), whereas supragranular neurons do not yet contain SPR mRNA. A few neurons in layer VI display moderate labeling. Astrocytes, identified with anti-glial fibrillary acid protein antibodies, did not express detectable levels of SPR mRNA in both adult and kitten visual cortex. These results indicate that SPR mRNA expression is transient in neurons of the white matter, and is developmentally regulated in supragranular layers. In addition, the localization of SPR mRNA in a subset of pyramidal cells suggests that substance P modulates the excitability of certain projection neurons which are the origin of extrinsic connections.",M1
1283362,"Antibodies to the rat substance P receptor: production and characterization.1. A protein A-rat substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) fusion protein was genetically engineered and used as an immunogen to raise a polyclonal antiserum to the SPR.

The fusion protein was purified using an IgG-Sepharose column, which specifically binds proteins containing the protein A moiety. The IgG fraction obtained after the immunization was cleaved to produce Fab fragments, which were subsequently purified using a fusion protein affinity column. The serum (anti-SPR Fab serum) was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunohistochemistry on both a constitutive cell line for the SPR (AR42J) and a cell line transfected with the SPR (KNRKSPR). 3. Specificity of the antiserum for SPR was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on cells using antiserum that had been preincubated with the protein A fusion protein (blocked). 4. The Ca2+ signal normally observed on stimulation of SPR with SP in AR42J cells and SP binding to KNRKSPR cells was shown to be diminished in the presence of anti-SPR Fab serum. SPR from both cell lines was immunoprecipitated using the anti-SPR Fab serum. The antiserum itself did not induce intracellular Ca2+ mobilization normally observed when cells were incubated with SP. 5. This specific SPR antiserum will be a useful tool to investigate further the mechanisms of SP/SPR interactions.",M1
1279124,"Tachykinin systems in the spinal cord and basal ganglia: influence of neonatal capsaicin treatment or dopaminergic intervention on levels of peptides, substance P-encoding mRNAs, and substance P receptor mRNA.The aim of the study was to test whether the synthesis of substance P (SP) and that of its receptor (also known as NK1 receptor) are coordinately regulated after chronic pharmacologic intervention in two neural systems, the spinal cord and basal ganglia. In one set of experiments, capsaicin was administered subcutaneously during the early postnatal period (day 3 after birth) to induce degeneration of afferent sensory neurons in the spinal cord. In the other set of experiments, interruption of dopaminergic transmission was achieved by two methods: (a) The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine was used to denervate dopaminergic neurons during the early postnatal period, and (b) haloperidol was used in adult animals to block dopaminergic transmission by receptor blockade. The spinal cord, striatum, or both were used for the quantification of tachykinin [SP and neurokinin A (NKA)] and opioid peptides [[Met5]-enkephalin (ME) and dynorphin A (1-8) (DYN)] by radioimmunoassays. The abundance of total SP-encoding preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA and SP receptor (<e>SPR</e>) mRNA in spinal cord (C5 to T1 segments), striatum, or microdissected substantia nigra was determined by northern blot or solution hybridization analysis. Amines and their acid metabolites were quantified by HPLC. Capsaicin administration (subcutaneously) during the early postnatal period increased latency in a hot-plate test, decreased SP and NKA levels, increased levels of PPT mRNAs, and did not affect SPR mRNA levels in the spinal cord. Intraspinal SP systems may attempt to compensate for the loss of afferent SP input, whereas spinal cord receptor mRNA levels do not appear to be altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
1382977,"Delineation of structural domains involved in the subtype specificity of tachykinin receptors through chimeric formation of substance P/substance K receptors.The mammalian tachykinin receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and consist of the substance P, substance K and neuromedin K receptors (<e>SPR</e>, SKR and NKR). We constructed 14 chimeric receptors in which seven transmembrane segments were sequentially exchanged between the rat SPR and SKR and examined the subtype specificity of the chimeric receptors by radioligand binding and inositol phosphate measurements after transfection into COS cells. All chimeric receptors showed maximum responses in agonist-induced inositol phosphate stimulation. Detailed analysis of five receptors with agonist selectivity similar to SPR indicated that the selectivity is mainly determined by the region extending from transmembrane segment II to the second extracellular loop together with a minor contribution of the extracellular N-terminal portion. This conclusion was more directly confirmed by an additional chimeric formation in which the introduction of the above middle portion of SPR into the corresponding region of SKR conferred a high affinity binding to substance P. The tachykinin receptors can thus be divided into two functional domains: the region covering transmembrane segments V-VII and responsible for fundamental recognition of the common tachykinin sequence; and its preceding portion involved in evoking subtype specificity by interacting with the divergent sequences of the peptides.",M1
1281755,"Measles virus-substance P receptor interaction: Jurkat lymphocytes transfected with substance P receptor cDNA enhance measles virus fusion and replication.1. We have demonstrated previously (Harrowe et al., 1990), using a lymphoblastoid cell line that constitutively expresses the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) (Payan et al., 1984, 1986), that this receptor may facilitate measles virus (MV) fusion with these cells. In order to test this hypothesis further, a stable cell line transfected with SPR cDNA has been established, and various stages of MV infection in SPR positive and negative cells compared. 2. Jurkat cells, a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line, were transfected with a cDNA clone encoding the SPR. Cells transfected with only the plasmid were used as controls. Jurkat cells and Jurkat vector control cells (J-vo) failed to demonstrate any detectable 125I-SP binding, whereas a clonally selected population of cells transfected with SPR cDNA (J-SPR) expressed about 50,000 receptors/cell (Sudduth-Klinger et al., 1992). 3. Using the J-vo- and J-SPR-transfected cell lines, the following experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of SPR expression on MV infection. To determine if MV would preferentially attach to J-SPR as compared to J-vo, we absorbed virus to cells at 37 degrees C for various times and measured bound MV using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Using this approach, we found that MV bound to a greater degree to J-SPR compared with J-vo. In addition to equilibrium being reached faster for J-SPR, the total amount of bound MV was higher on J-SPR. The effect was greater at lower MOIs, suggesting that there existed multiple binding sites for MV on these cells and that the affinity is higher for those cells expressing the SPR. 4. Since binding does not necessitate a successful viral infection, we needed to know if this difference in binding reflected a difference in infection. This was demonstrated by showing an approximate twofold increase in infected cells after a 2-hr binding period with J-SPR as compared to J-vo at an MOI of 1 in an infectious cell-center assay. Moreover, when both cells types were subjected to continuous infection in culture, J-SPR-infected cells produced a seven- to ninefold increase in measles viral titer in 24 hr as compared with J-vo. The observed increase in viral titer may have resulted in more of the J-SPR cells binding virus, as indicated by our binding and infectious cell-center data, or alternatively, the virus might have entered the J-SPR cells faster and begun replication before the J-vo-infected cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1
1281754,"Functional and immunological responses of Jurkat lymphocytes transfected with the substance P receptor.1. We have transfected the rat substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) cDNA into the leukemic T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat (J-wt) in order to study the effects of substance P (SP) on lymphocyte signaling mechanisms and the resultant neuropeptide-induced immunological changes. 2. The SPR cDNA was transfected into J-wt by the method of electroporation. Clones expressing SPRs were selected using a functional assay that measured SP-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and by their expression of specific 125I-SP binding. 3. One clone, J-SPR, was identified and shown by Northern blot and 125I-SP saturation binding techniques to express the 2.2-kb SPR message and approximately 50,000 SPRs/cell with a Kd of 0.3 nM, respectively. Stimulation of J-SPR by SP resulted in the rapid mobilization of [Ca2+]i. This response was dose dependent in the range 10(-11)-10(-6) M SP and was maximal at 10(-7) M SP, with an EC50 of 0.3-0.5 nM SP. We further demonstrated that the SPR is rapidly desensitized following SP stimulation and by activation of the cell's T-cell receptor (TCR). Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on J-SPR show that SP stimulation induces a Cl- current by a Ca2+ mediated process dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). 4. Stimulation of J-SPR by SP results in changes in the cell surface expression of a number of molecules that play important roles in cell adhesion and activation: the expression of LFA-1 is decreased, and CD2 and IL-2 receptors are increased by 30 min, 6 hr, and 24 hr, respectively, following stimulation, as assessed by antibody staining in a FACS. 5. The expression of functional SPRs in Jurkat lymphocytes will not permit a detailed examination of how the activation of SPRs result in altered immune responses and further elucidate the role this neuropeptide receptor plays in inflammation.",M1
1312928,"The primary structure and gene organization of human substance P and neuromedin K receptors.The gene organization and amino acid sequences of human substance P and neuromedin K receptors (<e>SPR</e> and NKR, respectively) are reported on the basis of molecular cloning and sequence determination of genomic DNA containing the respective receptor gene. The human SPR and NKR genes, unlike many other genes for G-protein-coupled receptors, (G protein, guanyl-nucleotide-binding-regulatory protein), contain introns which interrupt the protein-coding regions into 5 exons. The human SPR and NKR genes extend over 60 kb and 45 kb, respectively and are considerably larger than the human substance K receptor (SKR) gene consisting of 12 kb. All 4 introns, however, are located at equivalent positions of the three tachykinin receptor genes, suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestral gene. Human SPR and NKR consist of 407 and 465 amino acid residues, respectively, each possessing structural features characteristic of the members of G-protein-coupled receptors. The human and rat receptors show a common tendency of distinctly segmented sequence conservation and divergence among the three receptors, and the observed sequence conservation and divergence would contribute to the emergence of similar but distinct properties of the three receptors. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences and the gene sizes are more closely related between SPR and NKR than between SKR and NKR, suggesting that the SPR gene evolved from the primordial NKR gene after a gene duplication to form the NKR and SKR genes.",M1
1718267,"Molecular cloning, structural characterization and functional expression of the human substance P receptor.A cDNA encoding the human substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) was isolated and the primary structure of the protein was deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis. This SPR consists of 407 residues and is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Comparison of rat and human SPR sequences demonstrated a 94.5% identity. The receptor was expressed in a COS-7 cell line and displayed a Kd for Tyr-1-SP binding of 0.24 nM. Ligand displacement by naturally occurring tachykinin peptides was SP much greater than neurokinin A greater than neurokinin B. SP stimulation of transfected cells resulted in a rapid and transient inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate response.

1702421,"Selective inhibition of expression of the substance P receptor mRNA in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells by glucocorticoids.The effect of glucocorticoids on the regulation of the substance P receptor (<e>SPR</e>) mRNA was studied in rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells by Northern blot analysis with the cloned cDNA. After a lag period of about 1 h, dexamethasone rapidly decreased steady-state SPR mRNA to almost negligible levels by 2 h. This decrease occurred in a dose-dependent manner by dexamethasone and was caused by various steroids in accordance with their relative potencies as glucocorticoids. These results indicate that the expression of the SPR mRNA is selectively and negatively regulated by glucocorticoids through interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. The mechanisms of reduction of SPR mRNA levels were studied by treatment of AR42J cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The SPR mRNA half-life was approximately 30 min, and this rate remained unchanged by dexamethasone treatment. Furthermore, the rapid turnover of the SPR mRNA required ongoing protein synthesis. On the basis of the result of actinomycin D treatment, together with kinetics of dexamethasone-induced changes in SPR mRNA levels, we discuss the mechanism in which glucocorticoids act at transcription initiation to reduce SPR mRNA levels.",M1
20462430,"Photorhabdus adhesion modification protein (Pam) binds extracellular polysaccharide and alters bacterial attachment.BACKGROUND: Photorhabdus are Gram-negative nematode-symbiotic and insect-pathogenic bacteria. The species Photorhabdus asymbiotica is able to infect humans as well as insects. We investigated the secreted proteome of a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at different temperatures in order to identify proteins relevant to the infection of the two different hosts. RESULTS: A comparison of the proteins secreted by a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at simulated insect (28 degrees C) and human (37 degrees C) temperatures led to the identification of a small and highly abundant protein, designated Pam, that is only secreted at the lower temperature. The pam gene is present in all Photorhabdus strains tested and shows a high level of conservation across the whole genus, suggesting it is both ancestral to the genus and probably important to the biology of the bacterium. The Pam protein shows limited sequence similarity to the 13.6 kDa component of a binary toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. Nevertheless, injection or feeding of heterologously produced Pam showed no insecticidal activity to either Galleria mellonella or Manduca sexta larvae. In bacterial colonies, Pam is associated with an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)-like matrix, and modifies the ability of wild-type cells to attach to an artificial surface. Interestingly, Surface Plasmon Resonance (<e>SPR</e>) binding studies revealed that the Pam protein itself has adhesive properties. Although Pam is produced throughout insect infection, genetic knockout does not affect either insect virulence or the ability of P. luminescens to form a symbiotic association with its host nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. CONCLUSIONS: We studied a highly abundant protein, Pam, which is secreted in a temperature-dependent manner in P. asymbiotica. Our findings indicate that Pam plays an important role in enhancing surface attachment in insect blood. Its association with exopolysaccharide suggests it may exert its effect through mediation of EPS properties. Despite its abundance and conservation in the genus, we find no evidence for a role of Pam in either virulence or symbiosis.",M2
20407699,"Bifunctional polyacrylamide based polymers for the specific binding of hexahistidine tagged proteins on gold surfaces.We describe a modified bifunctional analogue of polyacrylamide that spontaneously forms self-assembled polymeric thin films on Au surfaces. The film is engineered to specifically bind histidine tagged proteins (6His), while simultaneously remaining inherently resistant to the non-specific adsorption of proteins in solution. The backbone of a polyacrylamide-co-n-acryloxysuccinimide copolymer is functionalized via tandem active ester (NHS) couplings with 3-(methylthio)propylamine (MTP) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). The resulting functionalized polymers form stable and exceptionally hydrophilic thin films that are approximately 2-5 nm thick, a mass coverage that varies with the MTP graft density. These films are characterized using a variety of techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), ellipsometry, surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>), and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)) to establish their structure and function. The protein resistance of the films, as demonstrated by their exposure to solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA), can be modulated by the amount of MTP grafted to the polymer, which in turn, affects their mass coverage. We show that it is possible to specifically capture hexahistidine tagged proteins with low incidences of nonspecific adsorption using these materials, a discrimination quantified using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at concentrations down to approximately 20 nM. These polymers also bind strongly to the surfaces of Au nanoparticles, stabilizing them against aggregation, providing them with a similar capacity to selectively bind 6His tagged proteins that can then be speciated using MALDI.",M2
20397247,"Template-assembled synthetic G-quadruplex (TASQ): a useful system for investigating the interactions of ligands with constrained quadruplex topologies.A new biomolecular device for investigating the interactions of ligands with constrained DNA quadruplex topologies, using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>), is reported. Biomolecular systems containing an intermolecular-like G-quadruplex motif 1 (parallel G-quadruplex conformation), an intramolecular G-quadruplex 2, and a duplex DNA 3 have been designed and developed. The method is based on the concept of template-assembled synthetic G-quadruplex (TASQ), whereby quadruplex DNA structures are assembled on a template that allows precise control of the parallel G-quadruplex conformation. Various known G-quadruplex ligands have been used to investigate the affinities of ligands for intermolecular 1 and intramolecular 2 DNA quadruplexes. As anticipated, ligands displaying a pi-stacking binding mode showed a higher binding affinity for intermolecular-like G-quadruplexes 1, whereas ligands with other binding modes (groove and/or loop binding) showed no significant difference in their binding affinities for the two quadruplexes 1 or 2. In addition, the present method has also provided information about the selectivity of ligands for G-quadruplex DNA over the duplex DNA. A numerical parameter, termed the G-quadruplex binding mode index (G4-BMI), has been introduced to express the difference in the affinities of ligands for intermolecular G-quadruplex 1 against intramolecular G-quadruplex 2. The G-quadruplex binding mode index (G4-BMI) of a ligand is defined as follows: G4-BMI=K(D)(intra)/K(D)(inter), where K(D)(intra) is the dissociation constant for intramolecular G-quadruplex 2 and K(D)(inter) is the dissociation constant for intermolecular G-quadruplex 1. In summary, the present work has demonstrated that the use of parallel-constrained quadruplex topology provides more precise information about the binding modes of ligands.",M2

20381694,"Detection of mutant p53 using field-effect transistor biosensor.We assessed the abilities of wild p53 and mutant p53 proteins to interact with the consensus DNA-binding sequence using a MOSFET biosensor. This is the first report in which mutant p53 has been detected on the basis of DNA-protein interaction using a FET-type biosensor. In an effort to evaluate the performance of this protocol, we constructed the core domain of wild p53 and mutant p53 (R248W), which is DNA-binding-defective. After the immobilization of the cognate DNA to the sensing layer, wild p53 and mutant p53 were applied to the DNA-coated gate surface, and subsequently analyzed using a semiconductor analyzer. As a consequence, a significant up-shift in drain current was noted in response to wild p53, but not mutant p53, thereby indicating that sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions could be successfully monitored using a field-effect-based biosensor. These data also corresponded to the results obtained using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) measurements. Taken together, our results show that a FET-type biosensor might be promising for the monitoring of mutant p53 on the basis of its DNA-binding activity, providing us with very valuable insights into the monitoring for diseases, particularly those associated with DNA-protein binding events.",M2

20307545,"Molecular basis for the high degree of antigenic cross-reactivity between hepatitis B virus capsids (HBcAg) and dimeric capsid-related protein (HBeAg): insights into the enigmatic nature of the e-antigen.The hepatitis B virus core gene codes for two closely related antigens: a 21-kDa protein that forms dimers that assemble as multimegadalton capsids, and a 17-kDa protein that also forms dimers but that do not assemble. The proteins, respectively referred to as core antigen (HBcAg) and e-antigen (HBeAg), share a sequence of 149 residues but have different amino- and carboxy-termini. Their structural and serological relationship has long been unclear. With insights gained from recent structural studies on immune complexes of the capsids, the relationship was reassessed using recombinant forms of the antigens and a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) commonly believed to discriminate between core and e-antigen. Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) was used to measure the affinities, in contrast to previous studies that used more error-prone and less sensitive plate-type assays. Four of the six mAbs did not discriminate between core and e-antigen, nor did they discriminate between e-antigen and dimers of dissociated core antigen capsids. One mAb (3120) was specific for assembled capsids and one (e6) was specific for unassembled dimers. Epitope valency of the e-antigen was also studied, using a sandwich SPR assay where e-antigen was captured with one mAb and probed with a second. The e-antigen is often considered to be a monomeric protein on the basis of monovalent reactivity with antibody pairs specific for either an alpha or beta epitope (in a prior nomenclature for e-antigen specificity). This model, however, is incorrect, because recombinant e-antigen is a stable dimer and its apparent monovalency is due to steric blockage. This was proven by the formation of a 2:1 Fab e6-e-antigen complex. These results suggest new approaches for the isolation of the authentic e-antigen, its biological assay, and its stabilization as an immune complex for structural studies.",M2
20302283,"Longitudinal surface plasmon resonance based gold nanorod biosensors for mass spectrometry.A  strategy  for analyte capture/ionization based on chemical derivatization of gold nanorods and infrared laser desorption ionization (IR-LDI) is described. This is the first example of laser desorption/ionization of biomolecules using gold nanorods irradiated with an IR laser. LDI is performed at wavelengths (1064 nm) that overlap with the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mode of gold nanorods. The absorbed energy from the laser facilitates desorption and ionization of the analyte. The wavelength of the LSPR band can be tuned by controlling the aspect ratio (length-to-diameter) of the nanorod. For example, the <e>SPR</e> band for Au nanorods having an aspect ratio of 5:1 is centered at approximately 840 nm, and this band overlaps with the 1064 nm output of a Nd:YAG laser. We show that a variety of biomolecules can be efficiently desorbed and ionized by 1064 nm irradiation of nanorods. We also show that analyte capture can be controlled by surface chemistry of the nanorods.

AgI/II contributes to virulence and has been studied as an immunological and structural target, but a fundamental understanding of its underlying architecture has been lacking. Here we report a high-resolution (1.8 A) crystal structure of the A(3)VP(1) fragment of S. mutans AgI/II that demonstrates a unique fibrillar form (155 A) through the interaction of two noncontiguous regions in the primary sequence. The A(3) repeat of the alanine-rich domain adopts an extended alpha-helix that intertwines with the P(1) repeat polyproline type II (PPII) helix to form a highly extended stalk-like structure heretofore unseen in prokaryotic or eukaryotic protein structures. Velocity sedimentation studies indicate that full-length AgI/II that contains three A/P repeats extends over 50 nanometers in length. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the high-affinity association between the A(3) and P(1) helices is enthalpically driven. Two distinct binding sites on AgI/II to the host receptor salivary agglutinin (SAG) were identified by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>).

QCM-D and SPR data confirm that the binding ability of rec1-resilin on a substrate is strongly pH-dependent the protein packing density on a gold surface is calculated to be 4.45 x 10(13) per cm(2) at the isoelectric point (IEP approximately 4.9), 8.79 x 10(11) per cm(2) at pH 2 and 9.90 x 10(11) per cm(2) at pH 12, respectively. Our findings based on the thickness, dissipation and viscoelasticity of the rec1-resilin adlayer also indicate that it is adsorbed onto the gold substrate with different orientation depending on pH, such as back-on adsorption at acidic pH of 2, compact end-on bilayer adsorption at the IEP and side-on at high alkaline pH of 12. When rec1-resilin is 'pinned' to the substrate at IEP and subsequently exposed to an electrolyte solution adjusted to different pH, it switches from a compact globular conformation of the bio-macromolecule at the IEP to a coil conformation at pH between IEP to IED (IED = pKa value of tyrosine amino acid residue) and an extended coil conformation at pH &gt; IED. This transformation from globule to coil to extended coil conformation is kinetically fast, robust and completely reversible.

A laser device implemented in the SPR system allowed us to trigger light-induced conformational changes in rhodopsin and to monitor light-dependent binding of the photoreceptor cell G-protein transducin to rhodopsin. The sensor chip surface can be regenerated and used for several rounds of interaction analysis. Furthermore, illuminated rhodopsin can be regenerated by applying 9-cis-retinal on the sensor chip surface.",M2
20217626,"Incorporation of a transmembrane protein into a supported 3D-matrix of liposomes for <e>SPR</e> studies.Surface analytical tools as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have become increasingly important in biomedical research since they offer high detection sensitivity compared to traditional biomedical methods. For the use of SPR as a biomedical research tool there is a need to immobilize the reactants to a solid sensor surface. It is nowadays fairly straightforward to immobilize various reactants and hydrophilic proteins to a solid sensor surface and SPR has successfully been used in several applications using such proteins when studying various protein interactions. When using SPR for the analysis of transmembrane proteins the immobilization onto the solid surface becomes more difficult. Transmembrane proteins are more sensitive to the surroundings and need to be incorporated into a structure where it can reside in a natural environment. Supported liposomes offer such environment. In this chapter a new method is presented where multilayers of such supported liposomes are used to immobilize transmembrane proteins onto a solid sensor surface which is suitable for use in SPR detection.",M2
20217625,"Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy in determination of the interactions between amyloid beta proteins (Abeta) and lipid membranes.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) spectroscopy is emerging as a useful tool for determination of molecular interactions in real time. Studies on the molecular pathogenesis of amyloidoses have shown that the plasma membrane plays an important role in amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity induced by amyloidogenic proteins. By immobilizing lipid bilayers on a sensor chip surface, SPR spectroscopy has been employed to examine the binding of amyloidogenic proteins, such as amyloid beta protein (Abeta), to a variety of lipid membranes, and it provided new insights into the molecular interactions between these amyloidogenic proteins and membranes. In this chapter, we describe the application of SPR spectroscopy to the determination of the binding of Abeta to lipid membranes.",M2
20217624,"Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy for studying the membrane binding of antimicrobial peptides.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) employs the optical principle of SPR to measure changes in mass on a sensor chip surface in real time. Surface chemistry has been developed which enables the immobilization of lipid bilayers and determination of protein-membrane interactions in real time. Antimicrobial peptides are being increasingly recognized as potential candidate antibacterial drugs in the face of the rapidly emerging bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics in recent years. However, a precise understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial peptide structure and their cytolytic function in a range of organisms is still lacking. This is a result of the complex nature of the interactions of antimicrobial peptides with the cell membrane, the mechanism of which can vary considerably between different classes of antimicrobial peptides. SPR has recently been applied to the study of biomembrane-based systems which has allowed a real-time analysis of binding affinity and kinetics. This chapter describes an SPR method to study the membrane interactions of melittin, a well-known antimicrobial peptide.",M2
20217620,"Carbohydrate-lectin interactions assayed by <e>SPR</e>.Surface plasmon resonance is a valuable tool to determine the affinity between glycoconjugates and sugar-binding proteins such as plant and animal lectins. The main interest of using such an approach is that neither the lectins - which are proteins - nor their ligands - natural compounds such as glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, or synthetic glycoconjugates such as glycoclusters or neoglycoproteins - require any tag. Because lectins bear several binding sites, they behave like immunoglobulin eliciting avidity phenomena. This peculiarity may lead to erroneous results if special conditions are not applied. We obtained best and reproducible results when the lectin was immobilized and its ligands were used as soluble analytes. With heterogeneous glycoconjugates such as neoglycoproteins (which are heterogeneous in terms of nature, number, and position of sugar residues) or a mixture of oligosaccharides, the data may be more accurately gathered by using the Sips approach, which has been used to determine mean binding constants of polyclonal antibodies. With small analytes such as oligosaccharides, we found it convenient to determine binding constants by using an inhibitory approach: a neoglycoprotein (M (r) = approximately 80,000) was allowed to bind to the immobilized lectin and small oligosaccharides were used as inhibitors. With larger glycoconjugates such as peptides substituted with glycoclusters, direct binding measurements gave accurate results. Because of the availability of low-cost simple sugars (mono- or disaccharides) it is very convenient to use large concentrations of such carbohydrates to clean the sensor chips instead of more drastic cleaning solutions such as acids or alkali, in such a way that the immobilized lectin is stable for many experiments.",M2
20217619,"<e>SPR</e> biosensor as a tool for screening prion protein binders as potential antiprion leads.Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of neurodegenerative disorders affecting animals and humans. No effective treatments are currently available for the diseases, vCJD in particular. It is believed that the formation of protease-resistant insoluble prion protein (PrP(Sc)), which is the main component of amyloidal deposits, from the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), is essential for the progression of the disease. Therefore, both PrP(Sc) and PrP(C) are currently being used as potential drug targets.This protocol details an optimised experimental protocol to conduct an affinity screening of compound libraries by the immobilisation of PrP(C) using an SPR-based instrument, Biacore 3000.",M2
20217618,"High-throughput kinase assay based on surface plasmon resonance.We have designed a novel high-throughput (HTP) kinase assay using an array-based surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) apparatus. For high flexibility and performance, the kinase assay procedure is divided into an in vitro phosphorylation part and a phospho-detection part on a sensor chip. Not only biotinylated peptides but also recombinant proteins fused with FLAG-GST tandem tag can be used as native substrates. The substrate is selectively captured by a capture antibody immobilized on a sensor chip, and phospho-tyrosine (pTyr) residues are detected by an anti-pTyr antibody. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation is calculated from the capture level of the substrates and the binding level of the anti-pTyr antibody monitored by SPR. A wide dynamic range and real-time monitoring of SPR contribute to improved data reliability, and optimization of the procedure for an array-based apparatus achieved multiple sample processing (1,000 samples/day).",M2
20217617,"Surface plasmon resonance signal enhancement for immunoassay of small molecules.Sensitive detection of small molecules using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) presents significant challenges as the antigen cannot serve as a signal generator because of its low mass; efficient binding of the target requires the binding event to be spaced from the sensor surface through a specialist linker conjugation. Competitive immunoassay of steroid hormones can be performed by conjugation through a rationally designed linker system at positions distant from existing antigenic functional groups. The binding signal from the primary antibody can then be further enhanced by sequential addition of secondary antibody or conjugated gold nanoparticles which can produce 13-fold signal enhancements through both their mass and co-operative plasmon coupling.",M2
20217616,"Affinity constants for small molecules from <e>SPR</e> competition experiments.Direct assay of small molecules by SPR in general is troublesome and at least tedious procedures have to be applied. Competition experiments offer an attractive alternative. A small ligand known to bind to the analyte is immobilized on an SPR sensor surface, and the binding of the larger analyte in the presence of compounds under investigation in a concentration range is assayed. The resulting inhibition curves of the equilibrium SPR signal as function of the compound concentration can be analyzed to yield thermodynamic binding constants for the interaction in solution between analyte and the compounds under investigation. An additional advantage of this method is that series of compounds can be analyzed using the same sensor surface, so there is no immobilization needed for each compound. An adaptation of the method to analyze interactions with bivalent analytes (e.g., antibodies) is also included. Some observed different affinities in solution compared to that on the SPR surface are discussed.",M2
20217615,"A capture coupling method for the covalent immobilization of hexahistidine tagged proteins for surface plasmon resonance.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) is a robust method to detect and quantify macromolecular interactions; however, to measure binding interactions, one component must be immobilized on a sensor surface. This is typically achieved using covalent immobilization via free amines or thiols, or noncovalent immobilization using high-affinity interactions such as biotin/streptavidin or antibody/antigen. In this chapter we describe a robust method to covalently immobilize His(6) fusion proteins on the sensor surface for SPR analysis.",M2

The challenge in its use is the controlled positioning of one of the components of an interaction on a carefully designed surface. Many attempts in interaction analysis fail due to the non-functional or unsuccessful immobilization of a reactant onto the complex matrix of that surface. The most common technique for linking ligands covalently to a hydrophilic solid surface is amine coupling via reactive esters. In this chapter detailed methods and problem discussions will be given to assist in fast decision analysis to optimize immobilization and regeneration. Topics in focus are different coupling techniques for small and large molecules, streptavidin-biotin sandwich immobilization, and optimizing regeneration conditions.",M2

The need to be aware of and critically test the assumptions underlying the analysis models is emphasized and the consequences for the experimental design are discussed. The two most common sources of deviation in SPR surface binding kinetics from the ideal pseudo-first-order binding kinetics of bimolecular reactions are mass transport limitations and the heterogeneity of the surface sites. These problems are intrinsic to the use of a biosensor surface for characterizing interactions. The effect of these factors on the observed binding kinetics, and strategies to account for them are reviewed, both in the context of mathematical data analysis, as well as the design of the experiments and controls.",M2
20217611,"Surface plasmon resonance: a general introduction.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) analysis is rather unique in that it allows assay of binding constants (affinity) and kinetic analysis of binding phenomena. This introductory chapter deals with some specific features that are relevant to many diverse applications. The role and impact of kinetics in biomolecular interactions is highlighted. A concise description of the physical principles of the SPR phenomenon is given from a practical point of view, such that some possibilities and limitations of the method can be rationalized, e.g., depth of the evanescent field. A specific condition that may come forward in kinetic analysis is mass transport limitation (MTL). A practical model is presented, which allows estimation of the extent of MTL. Based on this model it can be rationalized whether MTL can be avoided by experimental design. In this framework also rules are presented to convert SPR signals (RU or millidegree) to mass/surface unit. The chapter concludes with an overview of commercially available SPR equipment.",M2

The results showed that AM3 has 1000 and 5300 times higher affinity for cholesterol- and ergosterol-containing liposomes, respectively, than those without sterol. The two-state reaction model well reproduced the sensor grams, which indicated that the interaction is composed of two steps, which correspond to binding to the membrane and internalization to form stable complexes.",M2
20190519,"[Fragment screening using surface plasmon resonance optical biosensor technology]A surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) optical biosensor is a label-free biophysical device which can detect molecular interaction in real time. SPR is an emerging technology for fragment screening, the first step in fragment-based drug discovery. Low levels of protein consumption and the ability to detect interactions with K(d) as low as mM make this technology particularly attractive. Inherently small SPR responses due to fragment binding had been an issue but, owing to well-established experimental protocols, such responses have become readily detectable. Medium-throughput instruments are now on the market from several manufacturers that enable complete screening of a library with several thousand compounds within a few days. In fragment screening, test compounds are injected at a high concentration because of the low affinity expected for small molecules, making it likely that many false positives arise from non-specific binding to an unrelated part of the target protein. Such false positives have to be eliminated by a well-designed assay cascade so as to select true hits which can then be subjected to X-ray crystallization to obtain detailed structural information. SPR-based direct binding assays have to be developed with a sufficient binding capacity and good reproducibility with a Z'-factor larger than 0.6. In selecting hit candidates from fragment primary screens, the shape of sensorgrams, binding stoichiometry and response level to reference proteins when available must be carefully evaluated. The selected compounds from primary screening need to be further examined in terms of dose-dependence and binding competition against tight binding reference compounds to ensure that they bind to the designated site of the target protein.",M2
20184351,"Autocalibrated scanning-angle prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy for nanometer-precision axial position determination.An automatic calibration and scanning-angle prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) was constructed and tested for the highest vertical resolution. The angle of the incident laser beam can be changed automatically and reliably from subcritical angles to nearly 90 degrees with intervals smaller than 0.2 degrees, and the laser illumination spot in the sample can be calibrated to automatically overlap with the center of the microscope's field of view. By scanning through a wide range of incident angles with different evanescent-field layer thicknesses, the fluorescence intensity decay curves of randomly distributed fluorescent nanospheres in agarose gel were obtained and fitted with the theoretical decay functions to determine their vertical positions. The best axial resolution was demonstrated to be better than 10 nm under the rigorous statistical analysis of confidence levels and by the Monte Carlo simulation. The new setup was further utilized to determine the tilting angle of the microtubules buried in agarose gel and to find the precise surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) angle for gold film enhanced TIRFM. We demonstrate the new microscope's unique capability to find the best illumination configuration for complex systems automatically and reproducibly.",M2
20173933,"Effect of aging on optical properties of bimetallic sensor chips.Bimetallic silver/gold sensor chips are attractive since they combine the advantages of both silver and gold layers. Optical properties of the bimetallic sensor chips show significant aging effects. Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) curves were produced on an SPR device and the time dependence of aging on SPR curves was studied. The results show that resonance angle and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of response curves increase with the aging time after film deposition. The performance of the sensor chips in terms of intrinsic sensitivity (IS) degrades with aging time. The underlying mechanism of the aging effect is explained as the growth of a silver oxide layer between gold and silver during the aging process.",M2
20171645,"Modeling protein binding and elution over a chromatographic surface probed by surface plasmon resonance.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) spectroscopy is used as a scaled-down, analytical, pseudo-chromatography tool for analyzing protein binding and elution over an ion-exchange surface under cyclic sorption conditions. A micrometric-scale adsorption surface was produced by immobilizing a typical ion exchange ligand--diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)--onto commercially available planar gold sensor chip surfaces pre-derivatized with a self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid with known density. An explicit mathematical formulation is provided for the deconvolution and interpretation of the SPR sensorgrams. An adsorption rate model is proposed to describe the SPR sensorgrams for bovine serum albumin, used here as model protein, when the DEAE surface is subjected to a cyclic series of binding and elution steps. Overall, we demonstrate that the adsorption rate model is capable of quantitatively describing BSA binding and elution for protein titers from dilute conditions up to overloaded conditions and a broad range of salt concentrations.",M2
20170134,"Surface plasmon resonance analysis of antibiotics using imprinted boronic acid-functionalized Au nanoparticle composites.Au nanoparticles (NPs) are functionalized with thioaniline electropolymerizable groups and (mercaptophenyl)boronic acid. The antibiotic substrates neomycin (NE), kanamycin (KA), and streptomycin (ST) include vicinal diol functionalities and, thus, bind to the boronic acid ligands. The electropolymerization of the functionalized Au NPs in the presence of NE, KA, or ST onto Au surfaces yields bisaniline-cross-linked Au NP composites that, after removal of the ligated antibiotics, provide molecularly imprinted matrixes which reveal high sensitivities toward the sensing of the imprinted antibiotic analytes (detection limits for analyzing NE, KA, and ST correspond to 2.00 +/- 0.21 pM, 1.00 +/- 0.10 pM, and 200 +/- 30 fM, respectively). The antibiotics are sensed by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) spectroscopy, where the coupling between the localized plasmon of the NPs and the surface plasmon wave associated with the Au surface is implemented to amplify the SPR responses. The imprinted Au NP composites are, then, used to analyze the antibiotics in milk samples.",M2
20170113,"Quantification of immunoglobulin g in bovine and caprine milk using a surface plasmon resonance-based immunosensor.Detection of colostrum in bovine and caprine milks is essential for dairy industries to avoid negative economical and technological consequences. One of the best markers of the presence of colostrum is immunoglobulin G (IgG). Two quantification methods have been evaluated for IgG in bovine or caprine milk, based on the real-time immunodetection of IgG by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) spectroscopy. Calibration curves were established by extracting affinity data from the sensorgrams, either using the residual bound IgG level after the association and dissociation phases or using the IgG binding rate during the association phase. The binding rate method allows for substantially reduced analysis times of below 4 min, which make it compatible with the milking time of small ruminants. Moreover, the binding rate method showed a better analytical performance, with lower detection limit and higher precision and accuracy than the residual binding method.",M2

20140191,"A variant of TNFR2-Fc fusion protein exhibits improved efficacy in treating experimental rheumatoid arthritis.Etanercept, a TNF receptor 2-Fc fusion protein, is currently being used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, 25% to 38% of patients show no response which is suspected to be partially due to insufficient affinity of this protein to TNFalpha. By using computational protein design, we found that residue W89 and E92 of TNFR2 were critical for ligand binding. Among several mutants tested, W89Y/E92N displayed 1.49-fold higher neutralizing activity to TNFalpha, as compared to that of Etanercept. Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) based binding assay revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constant of W89Y/E92N to TNFalpha was 3.65-fold higher than that of Etanercept. In a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), W89Y/E92N showed a significantly better ability than Etanercept in reducing paw swelling and improvement of arthritic joint histopathologically. These data demonstrate that W89Y/E92N is potentially a better candidate with improved efficacy in treating RA and other autoimmune diseases.",M2
20133111,"Influence of ionic strength changes on the structure of pre-adsorbed salivary films. A response of a natural multi-component layer.Salivary films coating oral surfaces are critically important for oral health. This study focuses on determining the underlying nature of this adsorbed film and how it responds to departures from physiological conditions due to changes in ionic strength. Under physiological conditions, it is found that pre-adsorbed in vitro salivary film on hydrophobic surfaces is present as a highly hydrated viscoelastic layer. We follow the evolution of this film in terms of its effective thickness, hydration and viscoelastic properties, as well as adsorbed mass of proteins, using complementary surface characterisation methods: a Surface Plasmon Resonance (<e>SPR</e>) and a Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D). Our results support a heterogeneous model for the structure of the salivary film with an inner dense anchoring layer and an outer highly extended hydrated layer. Further swelling of the film was observed upon decreasing the salt concentration down to 1mM NaCl. However, upon exposure to deionised water, a collapse of the film occurs that was associated with the loss of water contained within the adsorbed layer. We suggest that the collapse in deionised water is driven by an onset of electrostatic attraction between different parts of the multi-component salivary film. It is anticipated that such changes could also occur when the oral cavity is exposed to food, beverage, oral care and pharmaceutical formulations where drastic changes to the structural integrity of the film is likely to have implications on oral health, sensory perception and product performance.",M2

Ag/a-Si(1-x)C(x):H and Au/a-Si(1-x)C(x):H multilayers are found to provide a significant advantage in terms of sensitivity over both Ag and Au for SPR refractive index sensing. The possibility for the subsequent linking of stable organic monolayers through Si-C bonds is demonstrated.

20128591,"Gold nanoparticles and imaging mass spectrometry: double imaging of latent fingerprints.Latent fingerprint (LFP) detection is a top-priority task in forensic science. It is a simple and effective means for the identification of individuals. Development of nanomaterials which maximize the surface interaction with endogenous substances on the ridges to enhance the contrast of the fingerprints is an important application of nanotechnology in LFP detection. However, most developments in this area have mainly focused on the visualization of the physical pattern of the fingerprints and failed to explore the molecular information embedded in LFPs. Here, we have integrated certain distinctive properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with imaging mass spectrometry for both the visualization and molecular imaging of LFPs. Two contrasting colors (blue and pink), arising from different surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) bands of the AuNPs, reveal the optical images of LFPs. The laser desorption/ionization property of the AuNPs allows the direct analysis of endogenous and exogenous compounds embedded in LFPs and imaging their distributions without disturbing the fingerprint patterns. The simultaneous visualization of LFP and the recording of its molecular images not only provide evidence on individual identity but also resolve overlapping fingerprints and detect hazardous substances.",M2

A critical angle measurement for total internal reflection identifies the ERI of the nanofluid at different nanoparticle concentrations. The corresponding SPR reflectance intensities correlate the nanofluidic ERI with the nanoparticle concentrations.

20121141,"Development of an aptamer beacon for detection of interferon-gamma.Traditional antibody-based affinity sensing strategies employ multiple reagents and washing steps and are unsuitable for real-time detection of analyte binding. Aptamers, on the other hand, may be designed to monitor binding events directly, in real-time, without the need for secondary labels. The goal of the present study was to design an aptamer beacon for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based detection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)--an important inflammatory cytokine. Variants of DNA aptamer modified with biotin moieties and spacers were immobilized on avidin-coated surfaces and characterized by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). The SPR studies showed that immobilization of aptamer via the 3' end resulted in the best binding IFN-gamma (K(d) = 3.44 nM). This optimal aptamer variant was then used to construct a beacon by hybridizing fluorophore-labeled aptamer with an antisense oligonucleotide strand carrying a quencher. SPR studies revealed that IFN-gamma binding with an aptamer beacon occurred within 15 min of analyte introduction--suggesting dynamic replacement of the quencher-complementary strand by IFN-gamma molecules. To further highlight biosensing applications, aptamer beacon molecules were immobilized inside microfluidic channels and challenged with varying concentration of analyte. Fluorescence microscopy revealed low fluorescence in the absence of analyte and high fluorescence after introduction of IFN-gamma. Importantly, unlike traditional antibody-based immunoassays, the signal was observed directly upon binding of analyte without the need for multiple washing steps. The surface immobilized aptamer beacon had a linear range from 5 to 100 nM and a lower limit of detection of 5 nM IFN-gamma. In conclusion, we designed a FRET-based aptamer beacon for monitoring of an inflammatory cytokine-IFN-gamma. In the future, this biosensing strategy will be employed to monitor dynamics of cytokine production by the immune cells.",M2
20106520,"Quantification of the binding affinity of a specific hydroxyapatite binding peptide.The genesis of bone and teeth involves highly coordinated processes, which involve multiple cell types and proteins that direct the nucleation and crystallization of inorganic hydroxyapatite (HA). Recent studies have shown that peptides mediate the nucleation process, control HA microstructure or even inhibit HA mineralization. Using phage display technology, a short peptide was identified that binds to crystalline HA and to HA-containing domains of human teeth with chemical and morphological specificity. However, the binding affinity and specific amino acids that significantly contribute to this interaction require further investigation. In this study, we employ a microfluidic chip based surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) technique to quantitatively measure peptide affinity by fabricating a novel 4 layer HA <e>SPR</e> sensor. We find the peptide (SVSVGMKPSPRPGGGK) binds with relatively high affinity (K(D) = 14.1 microM +/- 3.8 microM) to HA. The independently measured amino acid fragment SVSV seems to impart a significant contribution to this interaction while the MKPSP fragment may provide a conformational dependent component that enhances the peptides affinity but by itself shows little specificity in the current context. These data show that together, the two moieties promote a stronger synergistic binding interaction to HA than the simple combination of the individual components.",M2
20104921,"Anti-nonspecific protein adsorption properties of biomimetic glycocalyx-like glycopolymer layers: effects of glycopolymer chain density and protein size.In many cases, biomaterials surfaces are desired to be resistant to protein adsorption. A system fulfilling this task in nature is the so-called glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is an outer layer on the cell membrane with bound glycoproteins and glycolipids, exposing a pattern of carbohydrate groups. There is a growing interest to mimic this glycocalyx layer to have a tool to overcome the problems with uncontrolled protein adsorption on biomaterials. In this work a glycocalyx-like layer is artificially imitated by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of a glycomonomer, D-gluconamidoethyl methacrylate (GAMA), from a mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of an ATRP initiator-immobilized hydroxyl-terminated thiol and a methyl-terminated thiol as diluent. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/IR-ATR), contact angle, and ellipsometry measurements were employed to confirm the grafting of the glycopolymer. The anti-nonspecific protein binding properties of this glycopolymer layer were then investigated with surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). Three proteins with different size, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and fibrinogen were used as model solutes to investigate the influence of protein size on the protein resistance behavior. The glycopolymer chain density was controlled during surface-initiated ATRP by varying the ratio of the components in the mixed SAM, and the chain length was adjusted by ATRP time. The effect of chain density in combination with the protein size was also evaluated. The most important results are that poly(GAMA) layers of higher grafting density show resistance to adsorption of the model proteins used in this work and that the amount of adsorbed protein depends on the length and density of the glycopolymer chains and also on the size of the proteins.",M2
20102177,"High-sensitivity detection of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 using a gold/zinc oxide thin film surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor.We report that gold/zinc oxide (Au/ZnO) nanocomposite films were effectively employed to enhance the performance of surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) for the detection of tumor markers. Carbohydrate antigen 15.3 (CA15-3), a tumor marker for breast cancer, was chosen as a model analyte. We analyzed intensity response to the samples at various concentrations (0.0125 U/mL to 160 U/mL) in pleural fluid to evaluate the detection capability of the SPR biosensor based on Au/ZnO thin films. The linear range extended from 1 to 40 U/mL with a correlation coefficient of R(2) = 0.991 and a limit of detection reaching 0.025 U/mL at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. Compared with the degree of the shift in SPR intensity induced by the specific binding event between antibody and antigen, the change of intensity on the Au/ZnO layers was increased by at least 2 fold over that on the gold/chromium (Au/Cr) layers. In addition, we determined that the Au/ZnO layers allowed for a detection limit 4 times lower than the Au/Cr layers, which are in widespread use as the sensing interfaces in current SPR-based detectors. In conclusion, the use of Au/ZnO films greatly enhanced the SPR signal yield for this bimolecular interaction and showed high sensitivity.",M2
20100457,"The membrane insertion of helical antimicrobial peptides from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1.The interaction of two helical antimicrobial peptides, HPA3 and HPA3P with planar supported lipid membranes was quantitatively analysed using two complementary optical biosensors. The peptides are analogues of Hp(2-20) derived from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1 (RpL1). The binding of these two peptide analogues to zwitterionic dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and negatively charged membranes composed of DMPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (4:1) was determined using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) and dual polarisation interferometry (DPI). Using SPR analysis, it was shown that the proline substitution in HPA3P resulted in much lower binding for both zwitterionic and anionic membranes than HPA3. Structural changes in the planar DMPC and DMPC/DMPG (4:1) bilayers induced by the binding of both Hp(2-20) analogues were then resolved in real-time with DPI. The overall process of peptide-induced changes in membrane structure was analysed by the real-time changes in bound peptide mass as a function of bilayer birefringence. The insertion of both HPA3 and HPA3P into the supported lipid bilayers resulted in a decrease in birefringence with increasing amounts of bound peptide which reflects a decrease in the order of the bilayer. The binding of HPA3 to each membrane was associated with a higher level of bound peptide and greater membrane lipid disordering and a faster and higher degree of insertion into the membrane than HPA3P. Furthermore, the binding of both HPA3 and HPA3P to negatively charged DMPC/DMPG bilayers also leads to a greater disruption of the lipid ordering. These results demonstrate the geometrical changes in the membrane upon peptide insertion and the extent of membrane structural changes can be obtained quantitatively. Moreover, monitoring the effect of peptides on a structurally characterised bilayer has provided further insight into the role of membrane structure changes in the molecular basis of peptide selectivity and activity and may assist in defining the mode of antimicrobial action.",M2
20099807,"Characterization of non-equilibrium nanoparticle adsorption on a model biological substrate.The kinetics of nanoparticle (NP) adsorption on a model biological interface (collagen) is measured in microfluidic channels using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) imaging over a range of CdSe/ZnS quantum dot concentrations to investigate the underlying binding process. Spherical CdSe/ZnS core-shell NP, derivatized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA), were considered to be model NPs because of their widespread use in biological applications and their relatively monodisperse size. The kinetic adsorption data suggests that the binding between the NP and the collagen substrate is irreversible at room temperature (pH approximately 7.4), and this type of adsorption process was further characterized in the context of a surface absorption model. Specifically, diffusion-limited adsorption was found to predominate the adsorption process at lower concentrations (&lt;0.4 micromol/L), and NP adsorption was reaction-limited at higher concentration (&gt;0.4 micromol/L). A limited pH study of our system indicates that NPs desorb from collagen under acidic conditions (pH 5.5); no significant desorption was observed under neutral and basic pH conditions. These observations are consistent with electrostatic interactions being the dominant force governing NP desorption from collagen substrates. Our present methodology for characterizing the seemingly irreversible NP adsorption complements our earlier study where NP adsorption onto weakly adsorbing surfaces (self-assembled monolayers) was characterized by Langmuir NP adsorption measurements.",M2
20098778,"Hairpin DNA probe based surface plasmon resonance biosensor used for the activity assay of E. coli DNA ligase.Using hairpin DNA probe self-structure change during DNA ligation process, a sensitive, label-free and simple method of E. coli DNA ligase assay via a home-built high-resolution surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) instrument was developed. The DNA ligation process was monitored in real-time and the effects of single-base mutation on the DNA ligation process were investigated. Then an assay of E. coli DNA ligase was completed with a lower detection limit (0.6 nM), wider concentration range and better reproducibility. Moreover, the influence of Quinacrine on the activity of E. coli DNA ligase was also studied, which demonstrated that our method was useful for drug screening.",M2
20097030,"Surface plasmon resonance based immunosensor for serological diagnosis of dengue virus infection.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) is a promising tool in sensor technology for biomedical applications. An SPR based immunosensor was established for label free and real time assay for the serological diagnosis of dengue virus infection employing the dengue virus antigen as the sensing element. The dengue virus antigen conjugated with bovine serum albumin is covalently immobilized on a gold sensor chip via activated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, by amide coupling. Surface morphology of the biosensor was recorded using atomic force microscopy. Presence of dengue virus specific IgM antibodies in dengue positive sera was monitored by increase in resonance angle in direct immunoassay, whereas the principle of indirect competitive inhibition immunoassay was used to detect presence of dengue virus for early detection of the onset of dengue viral infection in clinical diagnostics. Results were compared with those obtained by MAC-ELISA. The regeneration was achieved by pepsin solution in glycin-HCl buffer (pH 2.2) and sensor surface displayed a high level of stability during repeated immunoreaction cycles. The proposed biosensor being simple, effective and based on utilization of natural antigen-antibody affinity, our study presents an encouraging scope for development of biosensors for diagnosis of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which continues to be a major health problem in the tropical and subtropical regions of world.",M2
20093103,"A binary Cy3 aptamer probe composed of folded modules.Aptamers are short single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences that are selected in vitro based on their high affinity to a target molecule. Dye-binding aptamers are promising tools for real-time detection of not only DNA or RNA sequences but also proteins of interest both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we aimed to isolate an RNA aptamer to Cy3, a widely used, membrane-permeant, and nontoxic fluorescent cyanine dye. Extensive selection of affinity RNA molecules to Cy3 yielded a unique sequence aptamer named Cy3_apt. The selected Cy3_apt was 83 nucleotides long and successfully shortened to 49 nucleotides long with increased affinity to Cy3 by multiple base changes. The shortest Cy3_apt is composed of two separate hairpin modules that are required for the affinity to Cy3 as monitored by the surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) assay. Also, the fluorescence of Cy3 increased on binding to Cy3_apt. The two modules of Cy3_apt, when detached from each other, functioned as a binary aptamer probe. We demonstrate that the binary Cy3_apt probe is applicable to the detection of target oligonucleotides or RNA-RNA interaction by tagging with target sequences. This binary probe consists of two folded modules, referred to as a folded binary probe.",M2
20092352,"Comparison of binding platforms yields insights into receptor binding differences between shiga toxins 1 and 2.Protein-glycan interactions are typically very weak, and avid binding is achieved when proteins express multiple glycan binding sites. Shiga toxin (Stx) uses glycan receptors to enter cells. Stx has five identical binding subunits, each with three nonidentical glycan binding sites. Previous studies examined binding to biantennary glycans expressing Pk trisaccharide mimics immobilized on streptavidin, resulting in display of four trisaccharides per streptavidin face. Stx1 preferred the Pk trisaccharide of its native receptor, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), while the more potent and clinically relevant variant, Stx2, preferred the Pk trisaccharide with the terminal galactose replaced with N-acetylgalactosamine (NHAc-Pk). In the present study, binding of Stxs to Pk analogues was examined using two experimental platforms, ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). ELISA was more sensitive than SPR. Sensitivity in the ELISA was due to high streptavidin density, suggesting that avid binding may require engagement of more than four trisaccharides. Selectivity for the Pk analogues was maintained in both experimental platforms. Glycan preference was mapped to binding site 2, since reciprocal mutation of a single amino acid (asparagine 32 of Stx1 B-subunit/serine 31 of Stx2 B-subunit) reversed binding preference. However, native Stx1 bound well to plates loaded with a 50:50 mixture of Pk-NHAc-Pk, while Stx2 bound less efficiently, suggesting that one of the Stx1 binding sites may only engage Pk, while another may tolerate either Pk or NHAc-Pk. Varying glycan structure and density across different in vitro binding platforms revealed important differences in receptor binding properties between Stx1 and Stx2.",M2
20086207,"Binding investigation of integrin alphavbeta3 with its inhibitors by <e>SPR</e> technology and molecular docking simulation.Integrins play critical roles in the process of angiogenesis and are attractive targets for anticancer therapies. It is desirable to develop new types of small-molecule inhibitors of integrin. Herein, the binding features of several inhibitors to integrin alpha(v)beta(3) have been studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technology and molecular docking analyses. The SPR results indicated that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) values are evaluated for the inhibitors and showed that the K(D) value of cyclopeptide c-Lys is much lower than the reference molecule. In addition, the 3D structural model of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) was generated according to the crystal structure of the integrin alpha(v)beta(3) complex, and the molecular docking simulation analyses revealed that the predicted binding sites for the most active cyclopeptide c-Lys were consistent with the reported structure. These results thus implied that cyclopeptide c-Lys could be developed as a novel inhibitor for integrin alpha(v)beta(3). The current work has potential for application in structure-based integrin alpha(v)beta(3) inhibitor discovery.",M2
20085747,"Role of membranotropic sequences from herpes simplex virus type I glycoproteins B and H in the fusion process.The entry of enveloped viruses involves attachment followed by close apposition of the viral and plasma membranes. Then, either on the cell surface or in an endocytotic vesicle, the two membranes fuse by an energetically unfavourable process requiring the destabilisation of membrane microenvironment in order to release the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The core fusion machinery, conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, involves glycoprotein B (gB) and the non-covalently associated complex of glycoproteins H and L (gH/gL). Both gB and gH possess several hydrophobic domains necessary for efficient induction of fusion, and synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions are able to associate to membranes and induce fusion of artificial liposomes. Here, we describe the first application of surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) to the study of the interaction of viral membranotropic peptides with model membranes in order to enhance our molecular understanding of the mechanism of membrane fusion. SPR spectroscopy data are supported by tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). We selected peptides from gB and gH and also analysed the behaviour of HIV gp41 fusion peptide and the cationic antimicrobial peptide melittin. The combined results of SPR and ESR showed a marked difference between the mode of action of the HSV peptides and the HIV fusion peptide compared to melittin, suggesting that viral-derived membrane interacting peptides all act via a similar mechanism, which is substantially different from that of the non-cell selective lytic peptide melittin.",M2
20084172,"Critical structural and functional roles for the N-terminal insertion sequence in surfactant protein B analogs.BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein B (SP-B; 79 residues) belongs to the saposin protein superfamily, and plays functional roles in lung surfactant. The disulfide cross-linked, N- and C-terminal domains of SP-B have been theoretically predicted to fold as charged, amphipathic helices, suggesting their participation in surfactant activities. Earlier structural studies with Mini-B, a disulfide-linked construct based on the N- and C-terminal regions of SP-B (i.e., approximately residues 8-25 and 63-78), confirmed that these neighboring domains are helical; moreover, Mini-B retains critical in vitro and in vivo surfactant functions of the native protein. Here, we perform similar analyses on a Super Mini-B construct that has native SP-B residues (1-7) attached to the N-terminus of Mini-B, to test whether the N-terminal sequence is also involved in surfactant activity. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: FTIR spectra of Mini-B and Super Mini-B in either lipids or lipid-mimics indicated that these peptides share similar conformations, with primary alpha-helix and secondary beta-sheet and loop-turns. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that Super Mini-B was dimeric in SDS detergent-polyacrylamide, while Mini-B was monomeric. Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>), predictive aggregation algorithms, and molecular dynamics (MD) and docking simulations further suggested a preliminary model for dimeric Super Mini-B, in which monomers self-associate to form a dimer peptide with a  saposin-like  fold. Similar to native SP-B, both Mini-B and Super Mini-B exhibit in vitro activity with spread films showing near-zero minimum surface tension during cycling using captive bubble surfactometry. In vivo, Super Mini-B demonstrates oxygenation and dynamic compliance that are greater than Mini-B and compare favorably to full-length SP-B. CONCLUSION: Super Mini-B shows enhanced surfactant activity, probably due to the self-assembly of monomer peptide into dimer Super Mini-B that mimics the functions and putative structure of native SP-B.",M2
20079682,"Analysis of immunoreaction with localized surface plasmon resonance biosensor.The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based optical biosensor was used as a potential tool for label-free detection of immunoreaction. The glass substrate covered with the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of gold colloids was used widely in the sensors. Here, the glass substrate was modified by chemical hydroxylation first, and then gold colloids were immobilized on the substrate by electrostatic adsorption. The LSPR spectra were obtained on UV-vis absorption spectrometer. The specificity was examined by extensive nonspecific binding tests. The resonance condition on the local dielectric environment enables a simple form of molecular sensing. The binding of analyte to the biosensor surface causes a change in the absorbance which was responsive to the concentration of human IgG. So, the LSPR sensing yields similar results to the <e>SPR</e> technique, yet with much simpler instrument.",M2
20065648,"Dimers and multimers of monoclonal IgG1 exhibit higher in vitro binding affinities to Fcgamma receptors.The in vitro binding of monomeric, dimeric and multimeric forms of monoclonal IgG1 molecules, designated mAb1 and mAb2, to the extracellular domains of Fcgamma receptors RI, RIIA and RIIIB were investigated using a surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) based biosensor technique. Stable noncovalent and covalent dimers of mAb1 and mAb2, respectively, were isolated from CHO cell expressed materials. The dissociation constants of monomeric mAb1 and mAb2 were determined to be 1 nM for the FcgammaRI-binding and 6-12 microM for the FcgammaRIIA- and FcgammaRIIIB-binding. Dimeric mAb1 and mAb2 exhibited increased affinities, by 2-3 fold for FcgammaRI and 200-800 fold for FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIB. Further increases in binding were observed when the antibodies formed large immune complexes with multivalent antigens, but not in a linear relation with size. The binding properties of monomeric mAb2 were identical with and without a bound monovalent antigen, indicating that antigen-binding alone does not induce measurable change in binding of antibodies to Fcgamma receptors. Dimerization is sufficient to show enhancement in the receptor binding. Given the wide distribution of the low-affinity Fcgamma receptors on immune effector cells, the increased affinities to aggregated IgG may lead to some biological consequences, depending on the subsequent signal transduction events. The SPR-based in vitro binding assay is useful in evaluating Fcgamma receptor binding of various species in antibody-based biotherapeutics.",M2
20060451,"The role of intermolecular interactions with penetratin and its analogue on the enhancement of absorption of nasal therapeutic peptides.We investigated the relationship between intermolecular binding and the ability of novel cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to enhance the nasal absorption of therapeutic peptides and proteins. The absorption-enhancing effect of a novel l-penetratin analogue, 'shuffle (R,K fix) 2' coadministered with different biotherapeutic peptides was evaluated after nasal administration in rats. Shuffle (R,K fix) 2 significantly increased the nasal absorption of insulin, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and exendin-4, compared with the absorption seen with l-penetratin. Intermolecular binding was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>)-based binding assay. The binding characteristics implied that the higher the amount of CPP bound, the greater the nasal drug absorption. In addition, the calculated binding ratio between CPP and drug proved a critical aspect in enhancing the absorption of insulin and GLP-1. This difference in the enhancing effect of CPPs on nasal drug absorption is attributed to the degree of binding with the therapeutic macromolecule.",M2
20059279,"Design considerations for surface plasmon resonance-based fiber-optic detection of human blood group.A fiber-optic surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) sensor for the detection of human blood groups is proposed. Previous experimental results describing the wavelength-dependent refractive index variation of multiple samples of different blood groups are considered for theoretical calculations. The spectral interrogation method, along with silica fiber and silver layer, is considered. The sensor's performance is closely analyzed in terms of shift in SPR wavelength and SPR curve width in order to optimize the design parameters for a reliable and accurate blood-group identifier. The sensor design parameters include silver layer thickness, fiber core diameter, sensing region length, and temperature variation. The results are explained in terms of light coupling and plasmon resonance condition. The proposed sensing probe is able to provide high sensitivity and accuracy of blood-group detection, thereby opening an easy and reliable window for medical applications.",M2
20058938,"Degradation and adsorption characteristics of PHB depolymerase as revealed by kinetics of mutant enzymes with amino acid substitution in substrate-binding domain.Extracelluar Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) depolymerase (PhaZ(RpiT1)) from Ralstonia pickettii T1 adsorbs to PHB surface via its substrate-binding domain (SBD) to enhance PHB degradation. Our previous study combining PCR random mutagenesis with the determination of PHB degradation levels of mutant enzymes suggested that Ser, Tyr, Val, Ala, and Leu residues in SBD are probably involved in the enzymatic adsorption to and degradation of PHB. In the present study, the effects of mutations at Leu441, Tyr443, and Ser445 on PHB degradation were investigated because these residues were predicted to form a beta-sheet structure and orient in the same direction to interact possibly directly with the PHB surface. Purified L441H, Y443H, and S445C mutant enzymes were prepared, and their CD spectra and hydrolytic activities for water-soluble substrates were found to be identical to those of wild-type enzyme, indicating that these mutations have no influence on their structures and their ability to cleave the ester bond. In contrast, the PHB-degrading activity of these mutants differed from that of the wild type: L441H and Y443H enzymes had lower PHB-degrading activity than their wild-type counterpart, whereas S445C had higher activity. Kinetic analysis of PHB degradation by the mutants suggested that the hydrophobic residues at these positions are important for the enzyme adsorption to the PHB surface, and such substitutions as Y443H and S445C may more effectively disrupt the PHB surface to enhance the hydrolysis of PHB polymer chains than the wild-type enzyme. Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) analysis revealed that the three substitutions mentioned above altered the association phase rather than the dissociation phase in the enzyme adsorption to the polymer surface.",M2
20056550,"Molecular design of N-linked tetravalent glycosides bearing N-acetylglucosamine, N,N'-diacetylchitobiose and N-acetyllactosamine: Analysis of cross-linking activities with WGA and ECA lectins.Two types of nonspacer- and spacer-N-linked tetravalent glycosides bearing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N,N'-diacetylchitobiose [(GlcNAc)(2)] and N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) were designed and prepared as glycomimetics. The interactions of wheat germ (Triticum vulgaris) agglutinin (WGA) and coral tree (Erythrina cristagalli) agglutinin (ECA) with a series of tetravalent glycosides and related compounds were studied using a hemagglutination inhibition assay, a precipitation assay, double-diffusion test, and an optical biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). The tetravalent glycosides were found to be capable of binding and precipitating the lectins as tetravalent ligands. Strong interactions with WGA, due to a combination of multivalency effects and spacer effects, were observed for tetravalent glycosides bearing flexible tandem GlcNAc. The chelate effect leads to large rate enhancement for the tetravalent system with favorable orientation of ligands. Our simple strategy produced multivalent glycosides with strong cross-linking activity for lectin as a specific coagulant.",M2
20047281,"Electrochemical surface plasmon resonance: basic formalism and experimental validation.A quantitative formalism of electrochemical surface plasmon resonance (EC-<e>SPR</e>) was developed for studying electrochemical reactions. The EC-SPR signal from the reactions was found to be a convolution function of electrochemical current, and therefore, EC-SPR is a powerful tool that can provide information similar to the conventional current-based electrochemical techniques. As an example, potential-sweep EC-SPR was analyzed in details and was found to provide a new way to measure convolution voltammetry without the need of numerical integration. In addition to the benefits provided by the conventional convolution voltammetry, the EC-SPR has several unique advantages, including (1) spatial resolution that is particularly attractive for studying heterogeneous reactions, (2) optical properties of the reactions species that may assist identification of reaction mechanisms, and (3) high surface sensitivity for studying surface binding of the reaction species. Experiments and numerical simulations were carried out for a model system, hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride. The simultaneously measured electrochemical current and SPR response confirmed the relationship between the two quantities, and the numerical simulations were in excellent agreement with the measurements.",M2
20045435,"Biochemical and biophysical characterisation of DBL1alpha1-varO, the rosetting domain of PfEMP1 from the VarO line of Plasmodium falciparum.Rosetting of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum is frequently observed in children with severe malaria. This adhesion phenomenon has been linked to the DBL1alpha domain of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) in three laboratory clones: FCR3S1.2, IT4R29 and Palo Alto varO. Here, we compare the soluble recombinant NTS-DBL1alpha(1)-varO domain (NTS: N-terminal segment) obtained from E. coli, Pichia pastoris and baculovirus/insect cell expression systems. In each case, the presence of NTS was necessary for obtaining a soluble product. Successful expression in E. coli required maltose-binding protein as an N-terminal fusion partner. Each expression system produced an identical, correctly folded protein, as judged by biochemical and biophysical characterisations, and by the capacity to elicit antibodies that react with the surface of VarO-infected erythrocytes and disrupt VarO rosettes. Binding studies using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) techniques showed that NTS-DBL1alpha(1) produced in E. coli binds to heparin with micromolar affinity. IC(50) constants for other sulphated oligosaccharides were determined using SPR by measuring their competitive binding to the soluble protein in the presence of immobilized heparin. The affinity to NTS-DBL1alpha(1) was related to the degree of sulphation of the oligosaccharide, although the position of the sulphate groups on the sugar rings was also important. VarO rosettes could be disrupted by sulphated oligosaccharides with an efficacy that correlated with their binding affinity to recombinant NTS-DBL1alpha(1). Thus high yields of soluble NTS-DBL1alpha(1) with native conformation have been produced, opening novel perspectives for both structure-function studies and vaccine development.",M2
20044245,"Detection of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated cellular response involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement using surface plasmon resonance.G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form a superfamily of cell surface receptors that play fundamental roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Although GPCRs have been the most successful targets for drug discovery, there still remain many orphan GPCRs, which provides opportunities for development of novel drugs. Here, we introduce a new method for evaluation of GPCR activation utilizing a surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) sensor. Cells expressing GPCRs were cultured directly on an SPR sensor chip and stimulated with GPCR ligands, resulting in SPR responses that were dependent on the type of G alpha subunits coupling with receptors. Namely G(i)- and/or G(12/13)-coupled receptors evoked SPR responses but G(s)- or G(q)-coupled ones did not. Analyses on the intracellular signal pathways revealed that small G protein Rho/Rac-mediated actin rearrangement plays an important role in the signal transduction pathways leading to the SPR responses. An SPR response was also evoked by insulin-like growth factor-1, which stimulates Rac-dependent stress fiber formation via its receptor-tyrosine kinase. Thus, this method provides a unique opportunity for real-time monitoring of cellular responses involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, and may be useful in ligand/drug discovery for certain types of receptor, such as G(i)- and G(12/13)-coupled receptors.",M2
20041723,"Interaction of hydrophobically end-capped poly(ethylene glycol) with phospholipid vesicles: the hydrocarbon end-chain length dependence.We have investigated the adsorption of hydrophobically end-capped poly(ethylene glycol) (HE-PEG) with carbon number (m) in the hydrocarbon end chain ranging from 0 to 16 onto phospholipid membrane by use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). QCM-D and SPR studies show that the hydrophobic interaction between HE-PEG chains and the lipid membrane increases with the hydrocarbon chain length. At a low HE-PEG concentration, the adsorption cannot induce a vesicle-to-bilayer transition until the carbon number is up to 16. However, at a high HE-PEG concentration, the adsorption results in a vesicle-to-bilayer transition at m &gt; or = 12. ITC measurements demonstrate that enthalpy change (DeltaH) for the mixing of lipid vesicles with HE-PEG chains is too small to be detectable when m is less than 12. However, DeltaH changes from positive to negative as the carbon number increases from 12 to 16, indicating that the HE-PEG insertion increases with its hydrocarbon end-chain length. The present study reveals that the hydrophobic interaction between the lipid membrane and HE-PEG chains as well as the osmotic pressure drive the adsorption and insertion of such polymer chains.",M2
20036206,"Real-time assay method of lipid extraction activity.Intracellular lipid translocation is mediated by lipid transfer proteins and their functional impairments cause severe disorder in lipid metabolism. However, molecular mechanisms of protein-mediated lipid transfer remain unclear since conventional assay methods could not observe elementary processes in the lipid transfer reaction, such as lipid bilayer binding and lipid uptake. In this study, we found that ceramide extraction mediated by a ceramide trafficking protein (CERT) could be detected as decreasing the response of surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). Based on this finding, we developed a novel real-time assay method that enables quantitative evaluation of the ceramide extraction activity of CERT, using the SPR technique. Performing this SPR-based assay using ceramide-embedded and ceramide-free lipid bilayers as ligands allows for the exclusive investigation of ceramide uptake processes, differentiating them from other CERT-membrane binding events. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments of CERT using this SPR-based assay clearly elucidated whether an amino acid residue plays a role in the ceramide uptake process or the lipid bilayer binding process. This SPR-based assay method can separately evaluate the lipid extraction activity and lipid bilayer binding activity of the lipid transfer proteins, and provide more detailed information about lipid transfer phenomena.",M2
20028085,"Binding affinity and kinetic analysis of targeted small molecule-modified nanoparticles.Nanoparticles bearing surface-conjugated targeting ligands are increasingly being explored for a variety of biomedical applications. The multivalent conjugation of targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles is presumed to enhance binding to the desired target. However, given the complexities inherent in the interactions of nanoparticle surfaces with proteins, and the structural diversity of nanoparticle scaffolds and targeting ligands, our understanding of how conjugation of targeting ligands affects nanoparticle binding remains incomplete. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) to directly and quantitatively study the affinity and binding kinetics of nanoparticles that display small molecules conjugated to their surface. We studied the interaction between a single protein target and a structurally related series of targeting ligands whose intrinsic affinity varies over a 4500-fold range and performed SPR at protein densities that reflect endogenous receptor densities. We report that even weak small molecule targeting ligands can significantly enhance target-specific avidity (by up to 4 orders of magnitude) through multivalent interactions and also observe a much broader range of kinetic effects than has been previously reported. Quantitative measurement of how the affinity and kinetics of nanoparticle binding vary as a function of different surface conjugations is a rapid, generalizable approach to nanoparticle characterization that can inform the design of nanoparticles for biomedical applications.",M2
20028034,"Residues essential for plasminogen binding by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor.The 300 kDa cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) is a multifunctional protein that binds diverse intracellular and extracellular ligands with high affinity. The CI-MPR is a receptor for plasminogen, and this interaction can be inhibited by lysine analogues. To characterize the molecular basis for this interaction, surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) analyses were performed using truncated forms of the CI-MPR and plasminogen. The results show that the N-terminal region of the CI-MPR containing domains 1 and 2, but not domain 1 alone, of the receptor's 15-domain extracytoplasmic region binds plasminogen (K(d) = 5 +/- 1 nM) with an affinity similar to that of the full-length receptor (K(d) = 20 +/- 6 nM). In addition to its C-terminal serine protease domain, plasminogen contains lysine binding sites (LBS), which are located within each of its five kringle domains, except kringle 3. We show that kringles 1-4, but not kringles 1-3, bind the CI-MPR, indicating an essential role for the LBS in kringle 4 of plasminogen. To identify the lysine residue(s) of the CI-MPR that serve(s) as an essential determinant for recognition by the LBS of plasminogen, site-directed mutagenesis studies were carried out using a construct encoding the N-terminal three domains of the CI-MPR (Dom1-3His) which contains both a mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) and plasminogen binding site. The results demonstrate two lysine residues (Lys53 located in domain 1 and Lys125 located in the loop connecting domains 1 and 2) of the CI-MPR are key determinants for plasminogen binding but are not required for Man-6-P binding.",M2
20024058,"Integrated active mixing and biosensing using surface acoustic waves (SAW) and surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) on a common substrate.This article presents a device incorporating surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing and surface acoustic wave (SAW) actuation integrated onto a common LiNbO(3) piezoelectric substrate. The device uses Rayleigh-type SAW to provide active microfluidic mixing in the fluid above the SPR sensor. Validation experiments show that SAW-induced microfluidic mixing results in accelerated binding kinetics of an avidin-biotin assay. Results also show that, though SAW action causes a parasitic SPR response due to heat injection into the fluid, a relatively brief relaxation time following the SAW pulses allows the effect to dissipate, without affecting the overall assay response. Since both SPR sensors and SAW transducers can be fabricated simultaneously using low-cost microfabrication methods on a single substrate, the proposed design is well-suited to lab-on-chip applications.",M2

We describe here the thorough characterization of these substrates and arrays as they progress through the fabrication process. Two surface plasmon-conducting metals, gold and silver, were utilized in the carbon-on-metal substrate preparation and their SPR responses compared.

20014858,"Multivalent benzoboroxole functionalized polymers as gp120 glycan targeted microbicide entry inhibitors.Microbicides are women-controlled prophylactics for sexually transmitted infections. The most important class of microbicides target HIV-1 and contain antiviral agents formulated for topical vaginal delivery. Identification of new viral entry inhibitors that target the HIV-1 envelope is important because they can inactivate HIV-1 in the vaginal lumen before virions can come in contact with CD4+ cells in the vaginal mucosa. Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs) demonstrate the ability to act as entry inhibitors due to their ability to bind to glycans and prevent gp120 binding to CD4+ cells. However, as proteins they present significant challenges in regard to economical production and formulation for resource-poor environments. We have synthesized water-soluble polymer CBAs that contain multiple benzoboroxole moieties. A benzoboroxole-functionalized monomer was synthesized and incorporated into linear oligomers with 2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide (HPMAm) at different feed ratios using free radical polymerization. The benzoboroxole small molecule analogue demonstrated weak affinity for HIV-1BaL gp120 by <e>SPR</e>; however, the 25 mol % functionalized benzoboroxole oligomer demonstrated a 10-fold decrease in the K(D) for gp120, suggesting an increased avidity for the multivalent polymer construct. High molecular weight polymers functionalized with 25, 50, and 75 mol % benzoboroxole were synthesized and tested for their ability to neutralize HIV-1 entry for two HIV-1 clades and both R5 and X4 coreceptor tropism. All three polymers demonstrated activity against all viral strains tested with EC(50)s that decrease from 15000 nM (1500 microg mL(-1)) for the 25 mol % functionalized polymers to 11 nM (1 microg mL(-1)) for the 75 mol % benzoboroxole-functionalized polymers. These polymers exhibited minimal cytotoxicity after 24 h exposure to a human vaginal cell line.",M2
20000526,"Arsenic removal from Vietnamese groundwater using the arsenic-binding DNA aptamer.Single-stranded DNA aptamers were generated from a random library to remove arsenic from Vietnamese groundwater. On the basis of significant arsenic contamination levels, three areas in Ha Nam province (Vinh Tru, Bo De, and Hoa Hau) and five areas near the Mekong River Delta (MR1-5) were selected as study areas. The aptamers were in vitro selected using an arsenic aptamer affinity column created by immobilizing arsenic on Affi-gel 10 resin. Quantitative analyses of the aptamer candidates Ars-1 to Ars-8 by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) revealed the Ars-3 aptamer to have the highest affinity to arsenate [(As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)] with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 4.95 +/- 0.31 and 7.05 +/- 0.91 nM, respectively. The specific affinity interactions of the Ars-3 aptamer to arsenic were verified against other heavy metals. After obtaining successful removal results with a laboratory-prepared aqueous arsenic solution, Ars-3 was applied for removal of any arsenic present in the groundwater samples collected from the studied areas in Vietnam. Field results were also successful: various arsenic concentrations ranging from 28.1 to 739.2 microg/L were completely removed after 5 min of incubation with the arsenic-binding aptamer Ars-3.",M2
19997874,"Quantitative analysis of small molecule-nucleic acid interactions with a biosensor surface and surface plasmon resonance detection.Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) technology with biosensor surfaces has become a widely-used tool for the study of nucleic acid interactions without any labeling requirements. The method provides simultaneous kinetic and equilibrium characterization of the interactions of biomolecules as well as small molecule-biopolymer binding. SPR monitors molecular interactions in real time and provides significant advantages over optical or calorimetic methods for systems with strong binding coupled to small spectroscopic signals and/or reaction heats. A detailed and practical guide for nucleic acid interaction analysis using SPR-biosensor methods is presented. Details of the SPR technology and basic fundamentals are described with recommendations on the preparation of the SPR instrument, sensor chips, and samples, as well as extensive information on experimental design, quantitative and qualitative data analysis and presentation. A specific example of the interaction of a minor-groove-binding agent with DNA is evaluated by both kinetic and steady-state SPR methods to illustrate the technique. Since the molecules that bind cooperatively to specific DNA sequences are attractive for many applications, a cooperative small molecule-DNA interaction is also presented.",M2
19997429,"Surface plasmon resonance and field enhancement in #-shaped gold wires metamaterial.A #-shaped gold wires metamaterial is designed for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and sensing. The tunability of surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) excitations, hotspots distribution, localized field enhancement and sensitivity of the structure are investigated. In contrast to most metamaterial, the #-shaped structure exhibits two pronounced SPRs that are insensitive to the polarization of excitation light. Pure electromagnetic Raman enhancement factors of about 10(6) are achieved on the symmetrically distributed field hotspots. It is possible to break the usable wavelength range of conventional gold SERS substrates via higher order excitations of the #-shaped metamaterial. In addition, the sensitivity and the figure of merits are found to be comparable or even higher than those of conventional SERS substrates. All these factors together with the high reproducibility nature of metamaterial and its simple planer structure suggest that this structure is very promising for surface enhanced spectroscopy and sensing applications.",M2
19997370,"Propagation-dependent beam profile distortion associated with the Goos-Hanchen shift.The propagation-dependent profile distortion of the reflected beam is studied via deriving the theoretical model of the optical field distribution in both the near and far field. It is shown that strong and fast-varying beam distortions can occur along the propagation path, compared to the profile on the reflecting surface. Numerical simulations for the case of a typical <e>SPR</e> configuration with a sharp angular response curve reveal that, when the phase distribution in the angular range covered by the input beam becomes nonlinear, previous theories based on the linear phase approximation fail to predict the Goos-Hanchen shift and its propagation-dependent variations precisely. Our study could shed light on more accurate modeling of the Goos-Hanchen effect's impact on the relevant photonic devices and measurement applications.",M2
19997358,"Phase and amplitude sensitivities in surface plasmon resonance bio and chemical sensing.We consider amplitude and phase characteristics of light reflected under the Surface Plasmon Resonance (<e>SPR</e>) conditions and study their sensitivities to refractive index changes associated with biological and chemical sensing. Our analysis shows that phase can provide at least two orders of magnitude better detection limit due to the following reasons: (i) Maximal phase changes occur in the very dip of the SPR curve where the vector of probing electric field is maximal, whereas maximal amplitude changes are observed on the resonance slopes: this provides a one order of magnitude larger sensitivity of phase to refractive index variations; (ii) Under a proper design of a detection scheme, phase noises can be orders of magnitude lower compared to amplitude ones, which results in a much better signal-to-noise ratio; (iii) Phase offers much better possibilities for signal averaging and filtering, as well as for image treatment. Applying a phase-sensitive SPR polarimetry scheme and using gas calibration model, we experimentally demonstrate the detection limit of 10(-8) RIU, which is about two orders of magnitude better compared to amplitude-sensitive schemes. Finally, we show how phase can be employed for filtering and treatment of images in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio even in relatively noisy detection schemes. Combining a much better physical sensitivity and a possibility of imaging and sensing in micro-arrays, phase-sensitive methodologies promise a substantial upgrade of currently available SPR technology.",M2
19997319,"Silicon based total internal reflection bio and chemical sensing with spectral phase detection.Si-based total internal reflection (TIR) bio/chemical sensor presents an attractive alternative to Surface Plasmon Resonance (<e>SPR</e>) technology due to a relatively simple optical arrangement and technological implementation, as well as a relatively easy bio/chemical immobilization on Si/SiO(2) surface with a number of novel attractive applications. This sensor is based on the control of phase difference between p- and s-polarized components of light reflected from Si/air or Si/water interface in TIR geometry and a high sensitivity of the sensor is granted by a high refractive index of Si (3.56 at 1200 nm). We study properties of TIR sensors in a configuration of spectral phase detection and identify conditions of maximal phase sensitive response. We also experimentally show that the detection limit of Si-based TIR sensor can be lowered down to a level of detection of commercially available SPR devices (10(-6) Refractive Index Units, RIU) under the use of a proper low-noisy method of the phase control. The concept of Si-based TIR opens attractive prospects for the miniaturization of sensor devices, taking advantage of the advanced state of development of Si-based microfabrication technologies, while the proposed spectral phase detection scheme offers much easier packaging and calibration steps.",M2
19997309,"A generalized model of maximizing the sensitivity in intensity-interrogation surface plasmon resonance biosensors.Intensity interrogation of surface plasmon resonance (IISPR) biosensors possesses the greatest sensitivity beyond other interrogations and is operated at a fixed incident angle to enable real-time analysis without time delay, so that it promises excellent performance in biological/chemical detection and <e>SPR</e> imaging systems. Here we provide a general model to describe its sensitivity based on Lorentz equation and unveil the relation between the sensitivity and the metal thickness. This model presents the dependency between sensitivity and metal thickness, and the optimal thickness of gold layers to maximize the sensitivity in our experiment is 53 nm that agrees well in both measurement and simulation. This general model can be further applied in other intensity-interrogation SPR configurations as a design rule for sensing and imaging applications.",M2
19997302,"The characterization of GH shifts of surface plasmon resonance in a waveguide using the FDTD method.We have explicated the Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift in a mum-order Kretchmann-Raether configuration embedded in an optical waveguide structure by using the finite-difference time-domain method. For optical waveguide-type surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) devices, the precise derivation of the GH shift has become critical. Artmann's equation, which is accurate enough for bulk optics, is difficult to apply to waveguide-type SPR devices. This is because Artmann's equation, based on the differentiation of the phase shift, is inaccurate at the critical and resonance angles where drastic phase changes occur. In this study, we accurately identified both the positive and the negative GH shifts around the incidence angle of resonance. In a waveguide-type Kretchmann-Raether configuration with an Au thin film of 50 nm, positive and negative lateral shifts of -0.75 and + 1.0 microm are obtained on the SPR with the incident angles of 44.4 degrees and 47.5 degrees, respectively, at a wavelength of 632.8 nm.",M2
19997267,"Nanoimprinted plastic substrates for enhanced surface plasmon resonance imaging detection.Periodic nanostructures fabricated by Nanoimprint Litography (NIL) in low-cost plastic substrates and coated with thin gold film were explored for enhanced surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) detection. Rigorous coupled-wave analysis was used to model the SPRi response of these nanostructured surfaces. Two-dimensional nanogratings and nanogrooves were fabricated on Zeonor 1060R(TM) by NIL and followed by metal deposition. The detection of refractive index changes in the dielectric layer due to bulk medium change, DNA immobilization and DNA hybridization events were monitored using SPRi to assess the corresponding signal amplification. The results indicate target-dependent sensitivity enhancement which is maximized for the detection of biomolecular binding events. The 500 nm period nanogrooves provided a 4 times <e>SPR</e> signal amplification compared to the conventional uniform gold film on SF-11 glass for DNA hybridization detection. Our work demonstrates that the use of nanoimprinted plastic substrates provides a low-cost solution for the SPR-based detection with sensitivity that meets the requirements in practical diagnostic applications.",M2
19962753,"Functionalizable and ultra-low fouling zwitterionic surfaces via adhesive mussel mimetic linkages.In this work, a biomimetic polymer (pCB(2)-catechol(2)), with two zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (pCB) arms for ultra-low fouling and two adhesive catechol groups for surface anchoring, was developed. Two pCB arms were grown from an initiator with two catechol groups via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Binding tests of pCB(2)-catechol(2) were performed on a gold surface under a range of conditions such as pH values and solvents. Protein adsorption from single protein solutions of fibrinogen and lysozyme, and complex media of 100% blood plasma and serum was evaluated using a surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) sensor. Results are compared with those from two other polymers (i.e., one polymer with one pCB chain and one catechol group, termed as pCB-catechol, and another polymer with one pCB chain and two catechol groups, termed as pCB-catechol(2)). Furthermore, the direct immobilization of anti-activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (anti-ALCAM) was carried out on the pCB(2)-catechol(2) modified surface. Results showed that the antibody-immobilized surface maintained its excellent ultra-low fouling properties. The detection of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) in 100% blood plasma with high sensitivity and specificity was achieved. This work demonstrates an effective and convenient strategy to obtain functionalizable and ultra-low fouling surfaces.",M2
19961412,"Characterization of physical interaction between replication initiator protein DnaA and replicative helicase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.In the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, the causative agent of tuberculosis, the genetic and biochemical mechanisms for initiation of DNA replication are largely unknown. In the present study, we have characterized the physical interactions between M. tuberculosis DnaA and DnaB using both in vivo methods, such as bacterial two-hybrid assays, and in vitro techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) and Pull-down/Western blotting. The full-length N-terminus (1-206 residues) of DnaB was found to interact with DnaA, while the shorter N-terminal domain of DnaB (1-125 residues), which lacked the linker region, did not. Further SPR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the N-terminus (1-206 residues) of DnaB also had a critical role in regulating DnaA complex formation at the origin of replication (OriC). This regulatory effect was not obviously observed for DNA substrates containing only two DnaA-boxes. This is the first report showing a physical interaction between DnaA and replicative helicase DnaB from M. tuberculosis and the role in subsequent DnaA-OriC interactions. The findings reported here further the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for initiation of DNA replication in this important human pathogen.",M2
19956625,"Sulfatides partition disabled-2 in response to platelet activation.BACKGROUND: Platelets contact each other at the site of vascular injury to stop bleeding. One negative regulator of platelet aggregation is Disabled-2 (Dab2), which is released to the extracellular surface upon platelet activation. Dab2 inhibits platelet aggregation through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain by competing with fibrinogen for alphaIIbbeta3 integrin receptor binding by an unknown mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using protein-lipid overlay and liposome-binding assays, we identified that the N-terminal region of Dab2, including its PTB domain (N-PTB), specifically interacts with sulfatides. Moreover, we determined that such interaction is mediated by two conserved basic motifs with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.6 microM as estimated by surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) analysis. In addition, liposome-binding assays combined with mass spectroscopy studies revealed that thrombin, a strong platelet agonist, cleaved N-PTB at a site located between the basic motifs, a region that becomes protected from thrombin cleavage when bound to sulfatides. Sulfatides on the platelet surface interact with coagulation proteins, playing a major role in haemostasis. Our results show that sulfatides recruit N-PTB to the platelet surface, sequestering it from integrin receptor binding during platelet activation. This is a transient recruitment that follows N-PTB internalization by an actin-dependent process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our experimental data support a model where two pools of Dab2 co-exist at the platelet surface, in both sulfatide- and integrin receptor-bound states, and their balance controls the extent of the clotting response.",M2
19950893,"Formation of AgPt alloy nanoislands via chemical etching with tunable optical and catalytic properties.An effective way is developed to fabricate AgPt alloy nanoislands on gold nanorods based on the galvanic replacement between Ag and PtCl(4)(2-) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The optical and catalytic properties benefit from the porous structure composed of AgPt nanoislands. A large red shift (265 nm) after etching is observed for longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) in comparison with Au@Pt0.1@Ag. Alloy compositions in bulk miscibility gap can be obtained and finely tuned from Ag(0.56)Pt(0.44) to Ag(0.38)Pt(0.62). A unique composition dependence is found for both electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and catalytic oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) by hydrogen peroxide. In both systems, the highest catalytic activity is achieved at the alloy composition of Pt(0.62)Ag(0.38). Proper alloying with Ag not only improves the CO poisoning of Pt catalyst but also enhances the catalytic activity greatly.",M2
19939663,"High-sensitive flow-based kinetic exclusion assay for okadaic acid assessment in shellfish samples.Episodes of shellfish contamination with okadaic acid (OA) are a human health threat that is causing increasing concern. As a way to overcome the shortcomings involved in the reference methods of analysis set by legislations, alternative procedures are envisaged. This paper describes the development of different immunosensors for the analysis of OA, focusing on the comparison of their sensitivity, precision, ease of use and sample matrix effects. Initially, a surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>)-based immunosensor was developed, which enabled the quantification of the toxin in mussel samples at concentrations in the range of the 160 microg kg(-1) European regulatory limit with good percentages of recovery. Nevertheless, calibration curves with spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effects could not be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based on kinetic exclusion measurements was developed achieving the theoretical lowest limit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA antibody (IC(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in the assay solution). This highly sensitive automated system allows rapid and reliable OA quantification, with no significant matrix effects for the analysis of spiked mussel and scallop samples. Performance features such as high sensitivity and precision, low limits of detection and simplicity of the analysis protocol, shows the biosensing-systems based on kinetic exclusion measurements for toxin detection in shellfish samples as highly performing tools for rapid and continuous screening.",M2
19938822,"Measuring surface charge density and particle height using surface plasmon resonance technique.We demonstrate a method to measure surface charge density and particle height using surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) detection. It is based on two facts: (1) The equilibrium height of a charged particle over a charged surface depends on the electrostatic interaction between the particle and the surface; and (2) SPR is extremely sensitive to the height of the particle. We perform numerical simulations to establish the relations between the SPR signal and the particle height, and between the particle height and the surface charge density, and carry out systematic experiments, including effects of different buffer concentrations, particle sizes, and concentrations, to examine the relations. The simulation and experimental results are in good agreement with each other. Using the method, we determine surface charge density of gold surface functionalized with different molecules. If the surface charge density is known, the method can also be used to determine the charges of the particles.",M2
19926541,"Comparison of ELISA and <e>SPR</e> biosensor technology for the detection of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins.An enzyme labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor assay for the detection of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins were developed and a comparative evaluation was performed. A polyclonal antibody (BC67) used in both assay formats was raised to saxitoxin-jeffamine-BSA in New Zealand white rabbits. Each assay format was designed as an inhibition assay. Shellfish samples (n=54) were evaluated by each method using two simple rapid extraction procedures and compared to the AOAC high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mouse bioassay (MBA). The results of each assay format were comparable with the HPLC and MBA methods and demonstrate that an antibody with high sensitivity and broad specificity to PSP toxins can be applied to different immunological techniques. The method of choice will depend on the end-users needs. The reduced manual labor and simplicity of operation of the SPR biosensor compared to ELISA, ease of sample extraction and superior real time semi-quantitative analysis are key features that could make this technology applicable in a high-throughput monitoring unit.",M2
19921844,"Indium tin oxide nanoparticles with compositionally tunable surface plasmon resonance frequencies in the near-IR region.Here we report the synthesis of conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles (NPs) and their surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) properties. The SPR peaks of the ITO NPs can be easily tuned by changing the concentration of Sn doping from 3 to 30 mol %. The shortest SPR wavelength of 1618 nm in 10% Sn-doped ITO NPs may reflect the highest electron carrier density in the ITO NPs. The controllable SPR frequencies of metal oxides may offer a novel approach for noble-metal-free SPR applications. Unlike noble-metal nanostructures, ITO has no inter- and intraband transitions in the vis-near-IR region and represents a free-electron conduction, allowing us to systematically study the origin of optical effects arising from the SPRs of conduction electrons.",M2
19918786,"Surface plasmon resonance for high-throughput ligand screening of membrane-bound proteins.Technologies based on surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) have allowed rapid, label-free characterization of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. SPR has become the gold standard in industrial and academic settings, in which the interaction between a pair of soluble binding partners is characterized in detail or a library of molecules is screened for binding against a single soluble protein. In spite of these successes, SPR is only beginning to be adapted to the needs of membrane-bound proteins which are difficult to study in situ but represent promising targets for drug and biomarker development. Existing technologies, such as BIAcoreTM, have been adapted for membrane protein analysis by building supported lipid layers or capturing lipid vesicles on existing chips. Newer technologies, still in development, will allow membrane proteins to be presented in native or near-native formats. These include SPR nanopore arrays, in which lipid bilayers containing membrane proteins stably span small pores that are addressable from both sides of the bilayer. Here, we discuss current SPR instrumentation and the potential for SPR nanopore arrays to enable quantitative, high-throughput screening of G protein coupled receptor ligands and applications in basic cellular biology.",M2
19914317,"Fabrication of gold nanoparticles for targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer.The targeted delivery of a drug should result in enhanced therapeutic efficacy with low to minimal side effects. This is a widely accepted concept, but limited in application due to lack of available technologies and process of validation. Biomedical nanotechnology can play an important role in this respect. Biomedical nanotechnology is a burgeoning field with myriads of opportunities and possibilities for advancing medical science and disease treatment. Cancer nanotechnology (1-100 nm size range) is expected to change the very foundations of cancer treatment, diagnosis and detection.

19913402,"Surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) as a rapid tool for serotyping of Salmonella.An SPR-based sandwich immunoassay for serotyping of Salmonella is demonstrated. The Salmonella are captured on an SPR chip using polyclonal capture antibody. SPR sensorgrams are obtained for the immunoreactions of the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) surface antigens, of the captured bacteria, to their respective antibodies. The sensorgram data are compiled to determine the antigenic formula in accordance with the Kauffmann-White scheme. Salmonella Enteritidis was completely serotyped using this SPR-based method. In addition, Salmonella belonging to serogroups B, C and D were successfully assigned to their respective serogroups. Before serotyping the bacteria are grown to a concentration of 1x10(10) mL(-1). This SPR-based serotyping provides quantitative data, and thus, eliminates the possibility of false detections as encountered in the conventional slide agglutination test (SAT). This method was also proved to work with rough strains.",M2

In order for early detection of the Alzheimer's disease, an ultrasensitive diagnostic tool is required. In this study, an ultrasensitive surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) based immunosensor for beta3-amyloid (1-40) was developed and its signal enhanced (1-40) with a gold (Au) nanoparticle-antibody complex. Antibodies to beta3-amyloid (1-40) were immobilized on the Au surface leading to a highly efficient immunoreaction due to the fact the paratope of the antibody faced in the opposite direction to the solid surface. The surface morphology of the bio-surface was investigated by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The binding process of antibody fragments to the Au surface, target analytes, and Au nanoparticle-antibody complexes were monitored using SPR. The plot of SPR angle difference versus beta3-amyloid (1-40) concentration shows a linear correlation over a concentration range of nine orders of magnitude, having a detetion limit up to 1 fg/ml.",M2

The pretreatment of electrodes with Fc-D allows the covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase. The resulting integrated hybrid system provides electrical contact between the redox center of the enzyme and the electrode, and improves the overall bioelectrocatalyzed oxidation of glucose. Cyclic voltammetry combined with surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>) is used to investigate the redox-induced orientation changes of ferrocene-tethered dendrimers and the optimal electrical wiring of the enzyme, depending on the length of the alkyl chain of the ferrocene-tethered groups. The amount of substrate controls the steady-state concentration ratio of Fc/Fc(+) in the film composition.

19903492,"An antibody surface for selective neuronal cell attachment.An optimal surface for culturing human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neuronal cells is of high interest. In this study, a specific antibody to a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was immobilised on a solid surface of polystyrene and used as a selective matrix for culturing of hESC-derived neuronal cells. Thereafter, hESC-derived neurospheres were seeded on the matrix. The neurospheres did not attach to the NCAM antibody containing matrix whereas individual neuronal cells did. The neuronal cell attachment was depended on the NCAM antibody concentration. The neuronal cells were viable on the NCAM antibody containing matrix during an 8 day follow-up and exhibited typical bipolar morphology of immature neurons.

19896385,"Design, synthesis and evaluation of 4,7-diamino-1,10-phenanthroline G-quadruplex ligands.A series of 4,7-diamino-1,10-phenanthroline derivatives carrying positively charged side chains has been synthesized, and their G-quadruplex interaction evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) and surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>). In absence of side chains, 4,7-diamino-1,10-phenanthroline exhibits a weak but significant G-quadruplex stabilizing effect, compared to no stabilization by 1,10-phenanthroline. We hypothesize that this effect is due to increased basicity of the phenanthroline nitrogens and protonation or ion chelation to form a central positive charge which stack on the G-tetrad above the central ionic column. Introduction of positively charged side chains results in compounds with appreciable G-quadruplex stabilizing properties and high aqueous solubility, with the longer side chains giving more potent compounds. Ligands carrying guanidine side chains in general show higher quadruplex stabilizing activity and distinctly slower kinetic properties than their amino and dimethylamino analogues, possibly due to specific hydrogen bond interactions with the G-quadruplex loops.",M2
19908757,"Phenylalanine sensing based on surface plasmon resonance.A phenylalanine sensing system was constructed with photochromic spiroxazine derivative via surface plasmon resonance (<e>SPR</e>).

After spectroscopic characterizations of monolayer, various concentrations of d- and l-phenylalanine were employed as analytes on UV addressable ring-opened spiroxazine monolayer. The different SPR angle shift derived from interaction between d- and l-phenylalanine and spiroxazine monolayer can be explained by the different dipole moment of ionic complexes. Computer simulations using Molecular Orbital PACkage AM1 approximation reinforced the reliability of the experimental results.
