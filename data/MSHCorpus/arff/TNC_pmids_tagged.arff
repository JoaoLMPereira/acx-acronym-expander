19710535,"Pressure overload-induced right ventricular failure is associated with re-expression of myocardial tenascin-C and elevated plasma tenascin-C levels.BACKGROUND: We investigated whether (1) monocrotaline(MCT)-induced right ventricular (RV) dilatation is associated with re-expression of myocardial tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), (2) elevated plasma TNC levels can be used as a marker of ventricular dilatation, and (3) MCT-induced RV dilatation is associated with alterations of other remodeling-related proteins. METHODS: Rats were treated with MCT in low dose (30 mg/kg, MCT30, n=10) to induce compensated RV hypertrophy, in high dose (80 mg/kg, MCT80, n=11) to induce RV failure, and with saline as control (CONT, n=9). After 4 weeks, RV function was assessed. TNC gene expression, protein levels, and plasma levels were assayed. Myocardial gene expression of integrin subunit alpha6 and beta1, and myocardial proMMP2 and proMMP9 levels were assessed. RESULTS: TNC gene expression in the RV of MCT80 rats was significantly upregulated compared with RV of CONT (4-fold, p&lt;0.001) and MCT30 rats (3-fold, p&lt;0.01), whereas TNC gene expression was very low in LV and IVS of MCT80 rats, and absent in those of CONT and MCT30 rats. Myocardial TNC protein levels were only observed in MCT80 rats, and were higher in RV (0.62+/-0.64 ng/mg) than in LV (0.21+/-0.44 ng/mg) or IVS (0.21+/-0.09 ng/mg) (p&lt;0.01, RV vs LV and IVS). Plasma levels of TNC were significantly elevated in MCT80 rats compared with CONT (p&lt;0.05). RV volumes correlated positively with TNC plasma levels and RV ejection fraction correlated negatively with TNC plasma levels. MCT-induced RV failure was also associated with a significant downregulation of integrin alpha6 gene expression (by 48%, p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MCT-induced RV failure is associated with an upregulation of TNC gene expression, resulting in re-expression of myocardial TNC protein levels, and elevated TNC plasma levels. As RV ejection fraction correlated significantly with TNC plasma levels, TNC plasma levels may serve as a marker of ventricular failure. De-adhesive properties of TNC in combination with a downregulation of integrin alpha6 may have caused cardiomyocyte slippage, leading to adverse ventricular remodeling.",M1
19696512,"Genetic risk factors for musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.Acute and overuse musculoskeletal soft tissues injuries are common as a result of participating in specific physical or workplace activities. Multiple risk factors, including genetic factors, are implicated in the aetiology of these injuries. Common musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries for which a genetic contribution has been proposed include the Achilles tendon in the heel, the rotator cuff tendons in the shoulder and the cruciate ligaments in the knee. Recent developments in the identification of genetic risk factors for tendon and ligament injuries will be reviewed. Sequence variants within genes that encode for several tendon and/or ligament extracellular matrix proteins have been shown to be associated with specific musculoskeletal soft tissues injuries. Variants within the <e>TNC</e>, COL5A1 and MMP3 genes co-segregate with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The variant within the TNC gene also appears to co-segregate with Achilles tendon ruptures, while sequence variants within the COL1A1 and COL5A1 genes have been shown to be associated with cruciate ligament ruptures and/or shoulder dislocations. Whether these variants are directly involved in the development of these musculoskeletal soft tissue abnormalities or in strong linkage disequilibrium with actual disease-causing loci remains to be established. We proposed that genetic risk factors will in the future be included in multifactorial models developed to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries or related pathology. Clinicians could eventually use these models to develop personalised training programmes to reduce the risk of injury as well as to develop treatment and rehabilitation regimens for the injured individual.",M1
19690384,"Wnt signaling regulates smooth muscle precursor development in the mouse lung via a tenascin C/PDGFR pathway.Paracrine signaling from lung epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme is important for lung SMC development and function and is a contributing factor in an array of pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. Wnt7b, which is exclusively expressed in the lung epithelium, is important for lung vascular smooth muscle integrity, but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates lung SMC development is unclear. In this report, we have demonstrated that Wnt7b regulates a program of mesenchymal differentiation in the mouse lung that is essential for SMC development. Genetic loss-of-function studies showed that Wnt7b and beta-catenin were required for expression of Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta and proliferation in pulmonary SMC precursors. In contrast, gain-of-function studies showed that activation of Wnt signaling increased the expression of both Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta as well as the proliferation of SMC precursors. We further showed that the effect on Pdgfr expression was, in part, mediated by direct transcriptional regulation of the ECM protein tenascin C (<e>Tnc</e>), which was necessary and sufficient for Pdgfralpha/beta expression in lung explants. Moreover, this pathway was highly upregulated in a mouse model of asthma and in lung tissue from patients with pulmonary hypertension. Together, these data define a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis that is critical for smooth muscle development and disease progression in the lung.",M1
19641104,"Tenascin-C is an inhibitory boundary molecule in the developing olfactory bulb.We recently described the boundary-like expression pattern of the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-C (<e>Tnc</e>) in the developing mouse olfactory bulb (OB) (Shay et al., 2008). In the present study, we test the hypothesis that Tnc inhibits olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axon growth in the developing OB before glomerulogenesis. The period of time before glomerular formation begins, when axons remain restricted to the developing olfactory nerve layer (ONL), is crucial for axon sorting. Here, we show with in vitro analyses that OSN neurite outgrowth is inhibited by Tnc in a dose-dependent manner and that, in stripe assays, axons preferentially avoid Tnc. Using Tnc-null mice, we also show that that glomerular development is delayed in the absence of Tnc. In wild-type mice, OSN axons coalesce into immature or protoglomeruli, which further differentiate and segregate into glomeruli. Glomeruli are first identifiable as discrete structures at birth. In null mice, glomeruli appear immature at birth, remain fused to the ONL, and have a significantly larger diameter compared with wild-type controls. By postnatal day 4, null glomeruli are indistinguishable from controls. Thus, OSN axons appear delayed in their coalescence into glomerular structures. These data correlate with behavioral reports of Tnc-null mice, which are delayed by 24 h in their acquisition of an olfactory behavior (de Chevigny et al., 2006). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Tnc is an inhibitory boundary molecule in the developing OB during a key period of development.",M1
19626416,"Differential expression of tenascin-C in the developing human lung: an immunohistochemical study.Much of the specification for the basic embryonic body plan is the result of a hierarchy of developmental decisions at different developmental times. The extracellular matrix (ECM) appears to be a very dynamic structure during embryogenesis. One of the mesenchymal ECM proteins, tenascin, is reported to be transiently expressed during embryonic tissue development, and is absent or much reduced in most fully developed organs. The respiratory system is an outgrowth of the ventral wall of the foregut, and the epithelium of the larynx, trachea, bronchi and alveoli is of endodermal origin. The cartilaginous and muscular components are of mesodermal origin. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) in the developing human lung, during the pseudoglandular, canalicular and saccular stage of lung maturation. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the lungs of 30 embryos (10 corresponding to the 10th to the 16th gestational week (pseudoglandular stage), 10 to the 17th to the 23rd gestational week (canalicular stage), and 10 to the 24th to the 27th gestational week (saccular stage), were investigated by conventional histology and immunohistology for the expression levels of TNC. The changes observed in the distribution patterns suggest that during embryogenesis, the rate of tenascin synthesis changes significantly. During the pseudoglandular stage, the density of cells expressing TNC was higher in the condensing mesenchyme surrounding the epithelial glands than in the epithelial cells, whereas the inverse result was observed during the canalicular stage. During the saccular stage the pattern of immunoreactivity with TNC was lower than those of the pseudoglandular and canalicular stage, either in epithelial or mesenchymal cells, but it was highly expressed in the basement membranes. This restricted spatiotemporal distribution suggests that tenascin has a key role (1) in mesenchymal tissue remodeling during the pseudoglandular stage, a period that describes the development of the complete bronchial tree and (2) on the epithelial cell shape and function during the canalicular stage, a period that describes the formation of pneumocytes type I and pneumocytes type II. The later, will produce the surfactant, a phospholipid-rich fluid capable of lowering surface tension at the air-alveolar interface. During the saccular stage, tenascin was present mainly in the basement membranes surrounding the acinar and vascular structures, indicating a supporting and mechanical role.",M1
19596991,"Trimer stabilization, oligomerization, and antibody-mediated cell surface immobilization improve the activity of soluble trimers of CD27L, CD40L, 41BBL, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand.For many ligands of the TNF family, trimer stability and oligomerization status are crucial determinants of receptor activation. However, for the immunostimulatory ligands CD27L, CD40L, 41BBL, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand (GITRL) detailed information regarding these requirements is lacking. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the effect of trimer stability and oligomerization on receptor activation by these ligands. Treatment with soluble Flag-tagged CD27L, 41BBL, and GITRL minimally activated receptor signaling, while Flag-CD40L was highly active. Oligomerization with anti-Flag Abs further enhanced the specific activity of Flag-CD40L 10-fold and of Flag-41BBL more than 200-fold, but it failed to activate Flag-CD27L and Flag-GITRL. We next investigated the relevance of trimer stability by introducing the tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) trimerization domain, yielding stabilized Flag-TNC-ligand trimers. Oligomerization with anti-Flag Ab potently activated signaling by Flag-TNC-CD27L and Flag-TNC-GITRL and, albeit to a lesser extent, Flag-TNC-CD40L and Flag-TNC-41BBL. Forced hexamerization, by introducing an Ig Fc domain, revealed that hexameric derivatives of Flag-TNC-41BBL, Flag-CD40L, and Flag-TNC-GITRL all activate receptor signaling with high efficiency, whereas hexameric Flag-CD27L variant left inactive. Finally, we attempted to selectively activate receptor signaling on targeted cells, by using Ab fragment (single-chain fragment variable region, scFv)-ligand fusion proteins, an approach previously applied to other TNF ligands. Target cell surface Ag-selective activation was achieved for scFv-41BBL, scFv-CD40L, and scFv-GITRL, although the latter two displayed already significant activity toward Ag-negative cells. In conclusion, our data establish that trimeric CD40L is active, 41BBL requires hexamerization, GITRL requires trimer stabilization, and CD27L requires trimer stabilization and oligomerization. Furthermore, surface immobilization might be exploited to gain locally enhanced ligand activity.",M1
19561617,"Tenascin-C is an endogenous activator of Toll-like receptor 4 that is essential for maintaining inflammation in arthritic joint disease.Although there have been major advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with the advent of biological agents, the mechanisms that drive cytokine production and sustain disease chronicity remain unknown. Tenascin-C (encoded by <e>Tnc</e>) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein specifically expressed at areas of inflammation and tissue damage in inflamed rheumatoid joints. Here we show that mice that do not express tenascin-C show rapid resolution of acute joint inflammation and are protected from erosive arthritis. Intra-articular injection of tenascin-C promotes joint inflammation in vivo in mice, and addition of exogenous tenascin-C induces cytokine synthesis in explant cultures from inflamed synovia of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, in human macrophages and fibroblasts from synovia of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, tenascin-C induces synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines via activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Thus, we have identified tenascin-C as a novel endogenous activator of TLR4-mediated immunity that mediates persistent synovial inflammation and tissue destruction in arthritic joint disease.",M1
19508743,"The glia-derived extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C promotes embryonic and postnatal retina axon outgrowth via the alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domain TNfnD.Tenascin-C (<e>Tnc</e>) is an astrocytic multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that potentially promotes or inhibits neurite outgrowth. To investigate its possible functions for retinal development, explants from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat retinas were cultivated on culture substrates composed of poly-d-lysine (PDL), or PDL additionally coated with Tnc or laminin (LN)-1, which significantly increased fiber length. When combined with LN, Tnc induced axon fasciculation that reduced the apparent number of outgrowing fibers. In order to circumscribe the stimulatory region, Tnc-derived fibronectin type III (TNfn) domains fused to the human Ig-Fc-fragment TNfnD6-Fc, TNfnBD-Fc, TNFnA1A2-Fc and TNfnA1D-Fc were studied. The fusion proteins TNfnBD-Fc and to a lesser degree TNfnA1D-Fc were stimulatory when compared with the Ig-Fc-fragment protein without insert. In contrast, the combination TNfnA1A2-Fc reduced fiber outgrowth beneath the values obtained for the Ig-Fc domain, indicating potential inhibitory properties. The monoclonal J1/tn2 antibody (clone 578) that is specific for domain TNfnD blocked the stimulatory properties of the TNfn-Fc fusions. When postnatal day 7 retinal ganglion cells were used rather that explants, Tnc and Tnc-derived proteins proved permissive for neurite outgrowth. The present study highlights a strong retinal axon growth-promoting activity of the Tnc domain TNfnD, which is modulated by neighboring domains.",M1
19459213,"Tenascin C and tenascin R similarly prevent the formation of myelin membranes in a RhoA-dependent manner, but antagonistically regulate the expression of myelin basic protein via a separate pathway.Membrane formation and the initiation of myelin gene expression are hallmarks of the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from their precursors. Here, we compared the roles of the two related extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins Tenascin C (<e>Tnc</e>) and Tenascin R (Tnr) in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocyte precursors from Tnr-deficient mice exhibited reduced differentiation, as revealed by retarded expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in culture. This could be rescued with purified Tnr. In contrast, when we cultured oligodendrocytes on a Tnc-containing, astrocyte-derived ECM, they barely expressed MBP. This inhibition could be overcome when we used ECM from astrocytes deficient for Tnc, suggesting that Tnc inhibits differentiation. In contrast to their antagonistic effect on differentiation, both Tnc and Tnr similarly inhibited morphologic maturation. When oligodendrocytes were cultured on the purified glycoproteins, process elaboration and membrane expansion were reduced. Both Tnc and Tnr interfered with the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. Conversely, RhoA and Rac1 activation induced by cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) increased the formation of myelin membranes, whereas Y27632-mediated inhibition of the Rho-cascade prevented it without, however, affecting the fraction of MBP-expressing cells. Because Tnc and Tnr play antagonistic roles for differentiation and comparably inhibit morphologic maturation, we conclude that independent molecular pathways regulate these processes.",M1
19405959,"Tumour-associated tenascin-C isoforms promote breast cancer cell invasion and growth by matrix metalloproteinase-dependent and independent mechanisms.INTRODUCTION: The stromal microenvironment has a profound influence on tumour cell behaviour. In tumours, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition differs from normal tissue and allows novel interactions to influence tumour cell function. The ECM protein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is frequently up-regulated in breast cancer and we have previously identified two novel isoforms - one containing exon 16 (TNC-16) and one containing exons 14 plus 16 (TNC-14/16). METHODS: The present study has analysed the functional significance of this altered TNC isoform profile in breast cancer. TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 splice variants were generated using PCR-ligation and over-expressed in breast cancer cells (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MD-231, MDA-MB-468, GI101) and human fibroblasts. The effects of these variants on tumour cell invasion and proliferation were measured and compared with the effects of the large (TNC-L) and fully spliced small (TNC-S) isoforms. RESULTS: TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 significantly enhanced tumour cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.05) and invasion, both directly (P &lt; 0.01) and as a response to transfected fibroblast expression (P &lt; 0.05) with this effect being dependent on tumour cell interaction with TNC, because TNC-blocking antibodies abrogated these responses. An analysis of 19 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 to 4 (TIMP 1 to 4) revealed that TNC up-regulated expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-3 two to four fold relative to vector, and invasion was reduced in the presence of MMP inhibitor GM6001. However, this effect was not isoform-specific but was elicited equally by all TNC isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a dual requirement for TNC and MMP in enhancing breast cancer cell invasion, and identify a significant role for the tumour-associated TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 in promoting tumour invasion, although these isoform-specific effects appear to be mediated through MMP-independent mechanisms.",M1
19394429,"Tenascin-C stimulates contactin-dependent neurite outgrowth via activation of phospholipase C.Tenascin-C (<e>Tnc</e>) is transiently expressed during neural development. Within its alternatively spliced fibronectin type III (TNfn) -motifs the TNfnD domain is crucial for a neurite outgrowth-promoting region that is recognized by the GPI-linked adhesion molecule of the Ig-superfamily contactin. In order to understand the downstream signaling mechanisms, embryonic day E18 rat hippocampal neurons were cultivated on TNfnBD-containing and control substrates in the presence of various inhibitors. As predicted, axon outgrowth promotion could be suppressed by antibodies to the TNfnD domain, to contactin, or to the beta1-integrin subunit. The chelators BAPTA/AM or EGTA as well as blockade of membrane-based calcium channels or of the release of calcium from intracellular stores reduced axon growth to control levels. The inhibition of phospholipase C and its downstream targets protein kinase C or calmodulin kinase likewise blocked outgrowth promotion. We propose that TNfnBD stimulates the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by activating calcium- and phospholipase C-depending pathways. Digital video microscopy studies revealed that increase of fiber length was caused by an augmentation of growth cone velocity.",M1
19280660,"Genetic ablation of tenascin-C expression leads to abnormal hippocampal CA1 structure and electrical activity in vivo.Despite evidence that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is implicated in brain development and plasticity, its roles in the intact adult brain are unknown. Here we report that spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activity in freely moving adult TNC-deficient mice is abnormal. The power of cortical and hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations was enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice. The alteration in hippocampal gamma rhythm was subfield specific, such that CA1 gamma was accentuated while dentate gyrus gamma was normal. Similar to LFP, synaptic transmission and plasticity at perforant path synapses in the dentate gyrus were unaffected by the mutation. Morphological analyses revealed a subfield-specific reduction in the CA1 volume and a reduction in the numbers of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus as potential structural substrates of the observed functional aberrations. These findings indicate a role for tenascin-C in structural organization of the CA1 hippocampal subfield and in shaping neural activity.",M1
19181384,"Enforced covalent trimerisation of soluble feline CD134 (OX40)-ligand generates a functional antagonist of feline immunodeficiency virus.The feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) targets activated CD4-positive helper T cells preferentially, inducing an AIDS-like immunodeficiency in its natural host species, the domestic cat. The primary receptor for FIV is CD134, a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and all primary viral strains tested to date use CD134 for infection. To investigate the effect of the natural ligand for CD134 on FIV infection, feline CD134L was cloned and expressed in soluble forms. However, in contrast to murine or human CD134L, soluble feline CD134L (sCD134L) did not bind to CD134. Receptor-binding activity was restored by enforced covalent trimerisation following the introduction of a synthetic trimerisation domain from tenascin (<e>TNC</e>). Feline and human TNC-CD134Ls retained the species-specificity of the membrane-bound forms of the ligand while murine TNC-CD134L displayed promiscuous binding to feline, human or murine CD134. Feline and murine TNC-CD134Ls were antagonists of FIV infection; however, potency was both strain-specific and substrate-dependent, indicating that the modulatory effects of endogenous sCD134L, or exogenous CD134Lbased therapeutics, may vary depending on the viral strain.",M1
19147558,"Tenascin-C is a novel RBPJkappa-induced target gene for Notch signaling in gliomas.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) expression is known to correlate with malignancy in glioblastoma (GBM), a highly invasive and aggressive brain tumor that shows limited response to conventional therapies. In these malignant gliomas as well as in GBM cell lines, we found Notch2 protein to be strongly expressed. In a GBM tumor tissue microarray, RBPJk protein, a Notch2 cofactor for transcription, was found to be significantly coexpressed with TNC. We show that the TNC gene is transactivated by Notch2 in an RBPJk-dependent manner mediated by an RBPJk binding element in the TNC promoter. The transactivation is abrogated by a Notch2 mutation, which we detected in the glioma cell line Hs683 that does not express TNC. This L1711M mutation resides in the RAM domain, the site of interaction between Notch2 and RBPJk. In addition, transfection of constructs encoding activated Notch2 or Notch1 increased endogenous TNC expression identifying TNC as a novel Notch target gene. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of the transcriptional coactivator MAML1 or knocking down RBPJk in LN319 cells led to a dramatic decrease in TNC protein levels accompanied by a significant reduction of cell migration. Because addition of purified TNC stimulated glioma cell migration, this represents a mechanism for the invasive properties of glioma cells controlled by Notch signaling and defines a novel oncogenic pathway in gliomagenesis that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in GBM patients.",M1
19121738,"Identification of biomarkers in Dupuytren's disease by comparative analysis of fibroblasts versus tissue biopsies in disease-specific phenotypes.PURPOSE: Biomarkers are molecular mediators that can serve as indicators of normal biological processes, pathologic processes, and therapeutic interventions. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers in Dupuytren's disease (DD), a fibroproliferative benign tumor with an unknown etiology and high recurrence after surgery. METHODS: Bioinformatic analytical techniques were employed to identify candidate genes that may be differentially expressed in DD, which included gene expression analysis of microarray data and thorough literature searches in genetic linkage and other related biomolecular studies. All DD cases were males with advanced DD (n = 5, 66 years +/- 14). RNA was extracted from biopsies and corresponding cultures of normal fascia (unaffected transverse palmar fascia), palmar nodule and cord from each patient. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions were performed to determine the gene expression levels for disease-related transcripts. RESULTS: The bioinformatic analysis revealed 25 candidate genes, which were further short-listed to 6 genes via functional annotation. The 6 selected candidate genes included: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM12), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member (ALDH1) A1, Iroquois homeobox protein 6 (IRX6), proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>), and periostin (POSTN). The culturing treatments were shown to have significant impact on the gene expression for ALDH1A1, PRG4, and TNC. In tissue biopsies, significant fold changes were observed for ADAM12, POSTN, and TNC in the cord and/or nodule when compared with that of normal fascia. ADAM12 and POSTN are associated with accelerated or abnormal cell growth, whereas TNC has been associated with fibrotic diseases and cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated differential gene expression results in DD tissue biopsies compared with that of their corresponding cultures. ADAM12, POSTN, and TNC were identified from the cord and nodule biopsy samples as potential biomarkers in relation to DD development.",M1
18986532,"Differential gene expression associated with postnatal equine articular cartilage maturation.BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage undergoes an important maturation process from neonate to adult that is reflected by alterations in matrix protein organization and increased heterogeneity of chondrocyte morphology. In the horse, these changes are influenced by exercise during the first five months of postnatal life. Transcriptional profiling was used to evaluate changes in articular chondrocyte gene expression during postnatal growth and development. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from the articular cartilage of neonatal (0-10 days) and adult (4-5 years) horses, subjected to one round of linear RNA amplification, and then applied to a 9,367-element equine-specific cDNA microarray. Comparisons were made with a dye-swap experimental design. Microarray results for selected genes (COL2A1, COMP, P4HA1, TGFB1, TGFBR3, <e>TNC</e>) were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Fifty-six probe sets, which represent 45 gene products, were up-regulated (p &lt; 0.01) in chondrocytes of neonatal articular cartilage relative to chondrocytes of adult articular cartilage. Conversely, 586 probe sets, which represent 499 gene products, were up-regulated (p &lt; 0.01) in chondrocytes of adult articular cartilage relative to chondrocytes of neonatal articular cartilage. Collagens, matrix-modifying enzymes, and provisional matrix non-collagenous proteins were expressed at higher levels in the articular cartilage of newborn foals. Those genes with increased mRNA abundance in adult chondrocytes included leucine-rich small proteoglycans, matrix assembly, and cartilage maintenance proteins. CONCLUSION: Differential expression of genes encoding matrix proteins and matrix-modifying enzymes between neonates and adults reflect a cellular maturation process in articular chondrocytes. Up-regulated transcripts in neonatal cartilage are consistent with growth and expansion of the articular surface. Expression patterns in mature articular cartilage indicate a transition from growth to homeostasis, and tissue function related to withstanding shear and weight-bearing stresses.",M1
18815154,"Lack of association between Tenascin-C gene and spondyloarthritis.OBJECTIVES: We previously identified a new susceptibility region linked to SpA in 9q31-34. Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) appears as one of the best positional and functional candidate genes lying within this SPA2 locus. The objectives of the present study were to identify TNC polymorphisms, and to examine their putative association with SpA. METHODS: We first performed variants screening in 20 independent SpA patients from families with high linkage score to the SPA2 locus, and three unrelated controls: TNCs coding regions (28 exons), intron-exon boundaries and 5'- and 3'-flank regions were fully re-sequenced to identify polymorphisms. Then we genotyped selected variants in 183 independent trios, and assessed their intrafamilial association with SpA by transmission disequilibrium test. RESULTS: Variants screening allowed us to identify 26 polymorphisms, 7 of which were selected for further study, in addition to an intronic polymorphism previously reported as associated with Achilles tendon injuries. In intrafamilial association test, none of the variants showed significant transmission disequilibrium. Results from analysis restricted to AS were not different from those obtained on the whole SpA group. CONCLUSIONS: TNC was one of the best positional and functional candidate genes within the SPA2 locus. Nevertheless, we found no association between polymorphisms in this gene and SpA. However, we cannot exclude that variants located in intronic regions or in the vicinity of TNC, which were not tested in the present study, could be implicated in the predisposition to SpA.",M1
18793269,"Plant pharming of a full-sized, tumour-targeting antibody using different expression strategies.The aims of this work were to obtain a human antibody against the tumour-associated antigen tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) and to compare the yield and quality of plant-produced antibody in either stable transgenics or using a transient expression system. To this end, the characterization of a full-sized human immunoglobulin G (IgG) [monoclonal antibody H10 (mAb H10)], derived from a selected single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and produced in plants, is presented. The human mAb gene was engineered for plant expression, and Nicotiana tabacum transgenic lines expressing both heavy (HC) and light (LC) chain were obtained and evaluated for antibody expression levels, in vivo assembly and functionality. Affinity-purified H10 from transgenics (yield, 0.6-1.1 mg/kg fresh weight) revealed that more than 90% of HC was specifically degraded, leading to the formation of functional antigen-binding fragments (Fab). Consequently, H10 was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants through an Agrobacterium-mediated gene-transfer system. Moreover, the use of the p19 silencing suppressor gene from artichoke mottled crinkle virus raised antibody expression levels by an order of magnitude (yields of purified H10, 50-100 mg/kg fresh weight). Approximately 75% of purified protein consisted of full-sized antibody functionally binding to TNC (K(D) = 14 nm), and immunohistochemical analysis on tumour tissues revealed specific accumulation around tumour blood vessels. The data indicate that the purification yields of mAb H10, using a transient expression system boosted by the p19 silencing suppressor, are exceptionally high when compared with the results reported previously, providing a technique for the over-expression of anticancer mAbs by a rapid, cost-effective, molecular farming approach.",M1
18757758,"Mechano-regulated tenascin-C orchestrates muscle repair.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is a mechano-regulated, morphogenic, extracellular matrix protein that is associated with tissue remodeling. The physiological role of TNC remains unclear because transgenic mice engineered for a TNC deficiency, via a defect in TNC secretion, show no major pathologies. We hypothesized that TNC-deficient mice would demonstrate defects in the repair of damaged leg muscles, which would be of functional significance because this tissue is subjected to frequent cycles of mechanical damage and regeneration. TNC-deficient mice demonstrated a blunted expression of the large TNC isoform and a selective atrophy of fast-muscle fibers associated with a defective, fast myogenic expression response to a damaging mechanical challenge. Transcript profiling mapped a set of de-adhesion, angiogenesis, and wound healing regulators as TNC expression targets in striated muscle. Expression of these regulators correlated with the residual expression of a damage-related 200-kDa protein, which resembled the small TNC isoform. Somatic knockin of TNC in fast-muscle fibers confirmed the activation of a complex expression program of interstitial and slow myofiber repair by myofiber-derived TNC. The results presented here show that a TNC-orchestrated molecular pathway integrates muscle repair into the load-dependent control of the striated muscle phenotype.",M1
18753731,"Noninvasive detection of cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction in rats by 111 In Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody specific for tenascin-C.Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes heart failure, and thus it is important to evaluate cardiac repair as the early stage of LV remodeling. Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is transiently and abundantly expressed in the heart during the early stage of tissue remodeling after MI. However, it is not expressed in healthy adult heart. This study was undertaken to develop a new noninvasive diagnostic technique to detect cardiac repair after acute MI using 111 In Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody specific for TNC. 111 In-anti-TNC-Fab was injected intravenously in 13 rats at 1 (D1, n = 3), 3 (D3, n = 5), and 5 (D5, n = 5) days after producing MI and in 5 sham-operated rats (S). We performed autoradiography and dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (SPECT) of 111 In-anti-TNC-Fab and 99mTc methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI). The radioactivity in the heart was significantly higher in D (D1, 0.45 +/- 0.06% injected-dose/g; D3, 0.64 +/- 0.12; D5, 0.38 +/- 0.07) than S (0.27 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.01 versus D1 and D3, P &lt; 0.05 versus D5). By autoradiography, higher radioactivities were observed in the infarcted area than in the noninfarcted area of MI hearts. Dual-isotope SPECT demonstrated the regional myocardial uptake of 111 In-anti-TNC-Fab, which was complementary to the perfusion image. The results of the present study indicated that we can localize the infarcted region in the heart by ex vivo and in vivo imaging methods using 111 In-anti-TNC-Fab, and suggested the potential usefulness of noninvasive detection of cardiac repair.",M1
18617690,"An induction gene trap screen in neural stem cells reveals an instructive function of the niche and identifies the splicing regulator sam68 as a tenascin-C-regulated target gene.Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in a niche that abounds in extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. The ECM glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>Tnc</e>) that occurs in more than 25 isoforms represents a major constituent of the privileged NSC milieu. To understand its role for NSCs, the induction gene trap technology was successfully applied to mouse embryonic NSCs, and a library of more than 500 NSC lines with independent gene trap vector integrations was established. Our pilot screen identified Sam68 as a target of Tnc signaling in NSCs. The Tnc-mediated downregulation of Sam68, which we found expressed at low levels in the niche along with Tnc, was independently confirmed on the protein level. Sam68 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein, and its potential significance for cultured NSCs was studied by overexpression. Increased Sam68 levels caused a marked reduction in NSC cell proliferation. In addition, Sam68 is a signal-dependent regulator of alternative splicing, and its overexpression selectively increased the larger Tnc isoforms, whereas a mutated phosphorylation-deficient Sam68 variant did not. This emphasizes the importance of Sam68 for NSC biology and implicates an instructive rather than a purely permissive role for Tnc in the neural stem cell niche.",M1
18504437,"Identification of VEGF-regulated genes associated with increased lung metastatic potential: functional involvement of tenascin-C in tumor growth and lung metastasis.Metastasis is the primary cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Overexpression of c-myc in humans correlates with metastases, but transgenic mice only show low rates of micrometastases. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress both c-myc and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Myc/VEGF) in the mammary gland, which develop high rates of pulmonary macrometastases. Gene expression profiling revealed a set of deregulated genes in Myc/VEGF tumors compared to Myc tumors associated with the increased metastatic phenotype. Cross-comparisons between this set of genes with a human breast cancer lung metastasis gene signature identified five common targets: tenascin-C(<e>TNC</e>), matrix metalloprotease-2, collagen-6-A1, mannosidase-alpha-1A and HLA-DPA1. Signaling blockade or knockdown of TNC in MDA-MB-435 cells resulted in a significant impairment of cell migration and anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Mice injected with clonal MDA-MB-435 cells with reduced expression of TNC demonstrated a significant decrease (P&lt;0.05) in (1) primary tumor growth; (2) tumor relapse after surgical removal of the primary tumor and (3) incidence of lung metastasis. Our results demonstrate that VEGF induces complex alterations in tissue architecture and gene expression. The TNC signaling pathway plays an important role in mammary tumor growth and metastases, suggesting that TNC may be a relevant target for therapy against metastatic breast cancer.",M1
18503956,"Plasma biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis and remodeling in terminal heart failure patients supported by mechanical circulatory support devices.BACKGROUND: In this study we analyzed putative biomarkers for myocardial remodeling in plasma from 55 endstage heart failure patients with the need for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). We compared our data to 40 healthy controls and examined if MCS by either ventricular assist devices or total artificial hearts has an impact on plasma concentrations of remodeling biomarkers. METHODS &amp; RESULTS: Plasma biomarkers were analysed pre and 30 days post implantation of a MCS device using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We observed that the plasma concentrations of remodeling biomarkers: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>), galectin 3 (LGALS3), osteopontin (OPN) and of neurohumoral biomarker brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are significantly elevated in patients with terminal heart failure compared to healthy controls. We did not find elevated plasma concentrations for matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and procollagen I C-terminal peptide (PCIP). However, only BNP plasma levels were reduced by MCS, whereas the concentrations of remodeling biomarkers remained elevated or even increased further 30 days after MCS. LGALS3 plasma concentrations at device implantation were significantly higher in patients who did not survive MCS due to multi organ failure (MOF). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that mechanical unloading in endstage heart failure is not reflected by a rapid reduction of remodeling plasma biomarkers.",M1
18490578,"Examination of oral cancer biomarkers by tissue microarray analysis.OBJECTIVE: To validate the DNA microarray results on a subset of genes that could potentially serve as biomarkers of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by examining their expression with an alternate quantitative method and by assessing their protein levels. DESIGN: Based on DNA microarray data from our laboratory and data reported in the literature, we identified 6 potential biomarkers of OSCC to investigate further. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine expression changes of CDH11, MMP3, SPARC, POSTN, <e>TNC</e>, and TGM3 in OSCC and histologically normal control tissues. We further examined validated markers at the protein level by immunohistochemical analysis of OSCC tissue microarray sections. RESULTS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed upregulation of CDH11, SPARC, POSTN, and TNC gene expression and decreased TGM3 expression in OSCC tissue compared with control tissue; MMP3 was not found to be differentially expressed. In tissue microarray immunohistochemical analyses, SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine), periostin, and tenascin C exhibited increased protein expression in tumor tissue compared with control tissue, and their expression was primarily localized within tumor-associated stroma rather than tumor epithelium. Conversely, transglutaminase 3 protein expression was found only within keratinocytes in control tissue and was significantly downregulated in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Of 6 potential gene markers of OSCC, initially identified by DNA microarray analyses, differential expression of CDH11, SPARC, POSTN, TNC, and TGM3 were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differential expression and localization of proteins encoded by SPARC, POSTN, TNC, and TGM3 were clearly shown by tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis.",M1
18373886,"Breast cancer metastasis: a microRNA story.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with regulatory functions, which play an important role in breast cancer. Several studies have shown that miRNAs can act either as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes, and that measurement of miRNA expression in malignancies may have diagnostic and prognostic implications. This article highlights a series of three recent studies that prove the involvement of miRNAs in breast cancer metastases. The first proves that miR-10b indirectly activates the pro-metastatic gene RHOC by suppressing HOXD10, thus leading to tumor invasion and metastasis. The second proves that miR-373 and miR-520c can also promote tumor invasion and metastasis, at least in part by regulating the gene CD44. The third identifies miR-335, miR-206, and miR-126 as suppressors of breast cancer metastasis. Loss of miR-335 leads to the activation of SOX4 and <e>TNC</e> (encoding tenascin C), which are responsible for the acquisition of metastatic properties. Altogether, these remarkable findings are important for our understanding of malignant transformation in the breast and may have implications for the management of patients with advanced breast cancer. The use of miRNAs as anticancer therapeutic agents is promising, and such fine molecular studies certainly help in bringing miRNAs closer to clinical practice.",M1
18305139,"Biological and genetic interaction between tenascin C and neuropeptide S receptor 1 in allergic diseases.Neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1, GPRA 154, GPRA) has been verified as a susceptibility gene for asthma and related phenotypes. The ligand for NPSR1, Neuropeptide S (NPS), activates signalling through NPSR1 and microarray analysis has identified Tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>) as a target gene of NPS-NPSR1 signalling. TNC has previously been implicated as a risk gene for asthma. We aimed therefore to study the genetic association of TNC in asthma- and allergy-related disorders as well as the biological and genetic interactions between NPSR1 and TNC. Regulation of TNC was investigated using NPS stimulated NPSR1 transfected cells. We genotyped 12 TNC SNPs in the cross-sectional PARSIFAL study (3113 children) and performed single SNP association, haplotype association and TNC and NPSR1 gene-gene interaction analyses. Our experimental results show NPS-dependent upregulation of TNC-mRNA. The genotyping results indicate single SNP and haplotype associations for several SNPs in TNC with the most significant association to rhinoconjunctivitis for a haplotype, with a frequency of 29% in cases (P = 0.0005). In asthma and atopic sensitization significant gene-gene interactions were found between TNC and NPSR1 SNPs, indicating that depending on the NPSR1 genotype, TNC can be associated with either an increased or a decreased risk of disease. We conclude that variations in TNC modifies, not only risk for asthma, but also for rhinoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, we show epistasis based on both a direct suggested regulatory effect and a genetic interaction between NPSR1 and TNC. These results suggest merging of previously independent pathways of importance in the development of asthma- and allergy-related traits.",M1
18234543,"CPA6, FMO2, LGI1, SIAT1 and <e>TNC</e> are differentially expressed in early- and late-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma--a pilot study.To identify novel genes that could be involved in oncogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma a microarray-based gene-expression analysis was performed using tumour samples from patients with low-stage (n=4) and high-stage (n=4) disease in a pilot study. Genes (601) were found to be significantly regulated in cancer tissue compared to adjacent intraindividual mucosa controls. Genes (25) were identified with differences in their regulation comparing samples from early-stage cancer with those from advanced disease. The gene expression pattern of 5 of 7 genes examined by real-time-PCR verified the results received from the microarray-experiment. Among these, FMO2, CPA6, TNC and SIAT1 were significantly upregulated in early disease stages. LGI1 gene expression was significantly enhanced in normal adjacent mucosa of patients with early-stage disease without showing a differential expression in carcinoma biopsies. With this pilot study several novel genes were identified, which could be related to early and late stage disease. Hypotheses from these findings are discussed and have to be confirmed in a larger study sample.",M1
18160825,"Tenascin C in stem cell niches: redundant, permissive or instructive?The stem cell niche provides the specialized environment that is able to sustain the lifelong maintenance of stem cells in their discrete locations within organs. The niche is usually composed of several different cell types and a specialized extracellular matrix consisting of many different constituents. Additionally, a variety of growth factors are secreted into the extracellular space and contribute to the functional organization of the niche. Here, I will concentrate on the multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin C (<e>Tnc</e>) and discuss it as an exemplary molecule that is present in several stem cell niches. In spite of its intuitively suggestive presence, it has been difficult to provide functional evidence for the importance of Tnc in the context of stem cells. In the nervous system, the careful analysis of Tnc-deficient mice has revealed that the developmental program neural stem cell pass-through is delayed due to changes in growth factor responsiveness. To gain further insight, we have employed the gene trap technology in neural stem cells to identify potential Tnc target genes. This approach has surfaced 2 interesting candidates that may contribute to a better understanding of the signal(s) elicited by Tnc in neural stem/progenitor cells in the niche.",M1
17982629,"Over-expression of 14-3-3sigma in budding colorectal cancer cells modulates cell migration in the presence of tenascin-C.Epigenetic silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene by CpG hypermethylation has been reported in many kinds of cancers, but has been considered inapplicable in the colorectal variety. The expression of 14-3-3sigma in colorectal cancer is located primarily in the invasive area. The interaction between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in tumor invasion. In the current study, we investigated the correlation between 14-3-3sigma expression and the ECM, focusing especially on the presence of tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) at the invasive area of colorectal cancers. Correlations between the immunohistochemical expression of 14-3-3sigma and TNC, as well as other clinicopathological factors, were evaluated in 123 colorectal carcinoma tissues. 14-3-3sigma expression was frequently observed in budding tumor cells in the invasive area and expression was significantly correlated with budding formation (p=0.001), pTNM classification (p=0.001) and stromal TNC expression (p=0.004). Using colorectal cancer cell lines and ECMs, the up-regulation of 14-3-3sigma mRNA levels was investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. TNC surrounding the tumor cells increased 14-3-3sigma mRNA expression 1.8- to 2.2-fold in HCT116 cells. The effect of 14-3-3sigma over-expression on tumor cell migration was investigated using an agarose-cell droplet migration assay. Over-expression of 14-3-3sigma up-regulated HCT116 cell migration on TNC (p&lt;0.001). We concluded that the expression of 14-3-3sigma in the invasive area modulates tumor cell migration in certain types of colorectal cancer and thus facilitates tumor progression.",M1
17728181,"Reverse ventricular remodelling after cardiac resynchronization therapy is associated with a reduction in serum tenascin-C and plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels.BACKGROUND: In heart failure patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to reverse ventricular remodelling. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether changes in levels of circulating biomarkers of extracellular matrix metabolism correlate with the response to CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical parameters, left ventricular (LV) volumes, and circulating levels of tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and amino-terminal propeptide of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were assessed in 64 patients at baseline and 6 months follow-up. The majority of patients (72%) showed a &gt;10% reduction in LV end-systolic volume at follow-up, and were classified as responders to CRT. The remaining patients were classified as non-responders. In responders, a significant decrease in circulating levels of TNC (from 60+/-40 ng/mL to 47+/-30 ng/mL, p&lt;0.01), MMP-9 (from 55+/-30 AU to 44+/-27 AU, p&lt;0.01), and NT-proBNP (from 2106+/-1805 pg/mL to 1132+/-1289 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001) were observed at follow-up; MMP-2 levels were unchanged. In non-responders TNC, NT-proBNP, MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: At 6 months follow-up, CRT was associated with reverse LV remodelling, and a significant decrease in TNC, MMP-9, and NT-proBNP levels. This suggests an important role of ECM modulation in the process of reverse ventricular remodelling in patients responding to CRT.",M1
17703232,"Enforced covalent trimerization increases the activity of the TNF ligand family members TRAIL and CD95L.Variants of human TRAIL (hTRAIL) and human CD95L (hCD95L), encompassing the TNF homology domain (THD), interact with the corresponding receptors and stimulate CD95 and TRAILR2 signaling after cross-linking. The murine counterparts (mTRAIL, mCD95L) showed no or only low receptor binding and were inactive/poorly active after cross-linking. The stalk region preceding the THD of mCD95L conferred secondary aggregation and restored CD95 activation in the absence of cross-linking. A corresponding variant of mTRAIL, however, was still not able to activate TRAIL death receptors, but gained good activity after cross-linking. Notably, disulfide-bonded fusion proteins of the THD of mTRAIL and mCD95L with a subdomain of the tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) oligomerization domain, which still assembled into trimers, efficiently interacted with their cognate cellular receptors and robustly stimulated CD95 and TRAILR2 signaling after secondary cross-linking. Introduction of the TNC domain also further enhanced the activity of THD encompassing variants of hTRAIL and hCD95L. Thus, spatial fixation of the N-terminus of the THD appears necessary in some TNF ligands to ensure proper receptor binding. This points to yet unanticipated functions of the stalk and/or transmembrane region of TNF ligands for the functionality of these molecules and offers a broadly applicable option to generate recombinant soluble ligands of the TNF family with superior activity.",M1
17502243,"Elevated expressions of osteopontin and tenascin C in ascending aortic aneurysms are associated with trileaflet aortic valves as compared with bicuspid aortic valves.OBJECTIVE: Ascending aortic aneurysms (AscAAs) are a highly lethal condition whose pathobiology remains to be poorly understood. Although most AscAAs occur in the presence of a trileaflet aortic valve (TAV), a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital anomaly associated with an increased risk for an AscAA and dissection independent of functional valve pathology but secondary to inherent structural abnormality of the aorta. The objective of this investigation was to compare the patterns of gene expression in aortas between TAV and BAV patients with the aim of identifying markers for AscAAs. METHODS: We used microarray analysis to first compare messenger RNA expressions between aneurysmal aortas from TAV patients (n=11) and those from BAV patients (n=11), identified genes overexpressed in TAV aneurysms, and compared expressions of the selected genes among TAV aneurysms, BAV aneurysms, and normal aortas (n=3). Finally, expressions of the selected genes were assessed by immunostaining of aortas from the TAV, BAV, and normal specimens. RESULTS: Two overexpressed genes in the TAV group, osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>), were consistently more highly expressed in TAV aneurysms than in BAV aneurysms and normal aortas as determined by real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Differential staining revealed that OPN protein was concentrated in the medial smooth muscle and that TNC protein was concentrated around the vasa vasorum. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel potential markers, OPN and TNC, that are strongly associated with TAV aneurysms. The roles of OPN and TNC in influencing extracellular matrix remodeling in AscAAs warrant further investigation.",M1
17322629,"Higher serum tenascin-C levels reflect the severity of heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.BACKGROUND: Tenascin-C (TN-C), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is specifically expressed at high levels during embryonic development, but not in the adult heart. TN-C reappears at sites of inflammatory tissue remodeling or wound healing under various pathologic conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction, acute myocarditis, and some cases of cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the expression of TN-C might be useful for detecting the clinical characteristics of, and ventricular remodeling in, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating serum TN-C levels in 107 patients with DCM were measured using an ELISA kit. Clinical data were also assessed by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation analysis to estimate correlations between variables. Serum TN-C levels in DCM patients were higher than those in normal controls (p&lt;0.001). <e>TNC</e> levels showed a significantly positive correlation with New York Heart Association functional class (p&lt;0.001), B-type natriuretic peptide level (p&lt;0.001), cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray (p&lt;0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (p&lt;0.05) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (p&lt;0.01), and a significantly negative correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that increased serum TN-C levels indicate the severity of heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in patients with DCM.",M1
17264084,"Neural stem/progenitor cells express 20 tenascin C isoforms that are differentially regulated by Pax6.Tenascin C (<e>Tnc</e>) is an alternatively spliced, multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in the ventricular zone of the developing brain. Pax6-deficient small eye (sey) mouse mutants show an altered Tnc expression pattern. Here, we investigated the expression of Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells and their regulation by the paired-box transcription factor Pax6. Neural stem/progenitor cells cultured as neurospheres strongly expressed Tnc on the protein level. The Tnc isoform expression in neural stem/progenitor cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and dot blot Southern hybridization. In total, 20 different Tnc isoforms were detected in neurospheres derived from embryonic fore-brain cell suspensions. The Tnc isoform containing the fibronectin type III domains A1A4BD is novel and might be neural stem/progenitor cell-specific. Transient overexpression of Pax6 in neurospheres of the medial ganglionic eminence did not alter the total Tnc mRNA expression level but showed a pronounced regulative effect on different Tnc isoforms. The larger Tnc isoforms containing four, five, and six additional alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domains were up-regulated, whereas the small Tnc isoforms without any or with one additional domain were down-regulated. Thus, Pax6 is a homeodomain protein that also modulates the splicing machinery. We conclude that the combinatorial code of Tnc isoform expression in the neural stem/progenitor cell is complex and regulated by Pax6. These findings suggest a functional significance for individual Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells.",M1
17261551,"Tendon and ligament injuries: the genetic component.Tendons and ligaments within the upper and lower limbs are some of the more common sites of musculoskeletal injuries during physical activity. Several extrinsic and intrinsic factors have been shown to be associated with these injuries. More recently, studies have suggested that there is also, at least in part, a genetic component to the Achilles tendon, rotator cuff and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. However, specific genes have not been suggested to be associated with rotator cuff or anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Sequence variants of the tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>) gene, on the other hand, have been shown to be associated with Achilles tendinopathies and Achilles tendon ruptures, whereas a variant of the collagen V alpha 1 (COL5A1) gene has also been shown to be associated with Achilles tendinopathies. Both genes encode for important structural components of tendons and ligaments. The COL5A1 gene encodes for a component of type V collagen, which has an important role in regulating collagen fibre assembly and fibre diameters. The TNC gene, on the other hand, encodes for TNC, which regulates the tissue's response to mechanical load. To date, only variants in two genes have been shown to be associated with Achilles tendon injuries. In addition, although specific genes have not been identified, investigators have suggested that there is also a genetic component to both rotator cuff and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. In future, specific genotypes associated with increased risk of injury to specific tendons and ligaments can prevent these injuries by identifying individuals at higher risk.",M1
17202312,"Microarray-based identification of tenascin C and tenascin XB, genes possibly involved in tumorigenesis associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a complex variety of clinical manifestations. The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which are resistant to conventional therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To identify new signaling pathways involved in the malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas, we applied a 22,000-oligonucleotide microarray approach to a series of plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Changes in the expression of selected genes were then confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: We identified two tenascin gene family members that were significantly deregulated in both human NF1-associated tumors and NF1-deficient primary cells: Tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>) was up-regulated whereas tenascin XB (TNXB) was down-regulated during tumor progression. TNC activation is mainly due to the up-regulation of large TNC splice variants. Immunohistochemical studies showed that TNC transcripts are translated into TNC protein in TNC-overexpressing tumors. Aberrant transcriptional activation of TNC seems to be principally mediated by activator protein transcription factor complexes. CONCLUSION: TNXB and TNC may be involved in the malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Anti-TNC antibodies, already used successfully in clinical trials to treat malignant human gliomas, may be an appropriate new therapeutic strategy for NF1.",M1
17121418,"Deficiency of tenascin-C attenuates liver fibrosis in immune-mediated chronic hepatitis in mice.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is upregulated in chronic liver disease. Here, we investigated the contribution of TNC to liver fibrogenesis by comparing immune-mediated hepatitis in wild-type (WT) and TNC-null (TNKO) mice. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice received weekly intravenous injections of concanavalin A to induce hepatitis, and were sacrificed one week after the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th injections. In WT livers, immunohistochemical staining revealed a gradual increase in TNC deposition. TNC mRNA levels also increased sequentially and peaked after the 9th injection. Collagen deposition, stained with picrosirius red, was significantly less intense in TNKO mice than in WT mice, and procollagen I and III transcripts were significantly upregulated in WT mice compared with TNKO mice. Inflammatory infiltrates were most prominent after the 3rd-6th injections in both groups and were less intense in TNKO mice than in WT mice. Interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4 mRNA levels were significantly higher in WT mice than in TNKO mice, while activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and myofibroblasts, a cellular source of TNC and procollagens, were more common in WT livers. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in WT mice, but not in TNKO mice. In conclusion, TNC can promote liver fibrogenesis through enhancement of inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation, HSC recruitment, and TGF-beta expression during progression of hepatitis to fibrosis.",M1
16997097,"Immunohistochemical expression of fibronectin and tenascin after direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide.The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of 2 extracellullar matrix glycoproteins, fibronectin (FNC) and tenascin (<e>TNC</e>), following direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide (CH). Third molars scheduled for extraction were used. Standardized class I cavities with pulp exposures were prepared. After control of bleeding, CH powder was applied in the exposure sites, which were covered with CH cement (Dycal; Dentsply) and the cavities were filled with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. Three teeth were extracted at each post-treatment period (1, 7, 14, and 30 days). Demineralized and paraffin-embedded specimens were stained for histologic technique (hematoxylin-eosin) and for immunohistochemical analysis. Anti-TNC and anti-FNC monoclonal antibodies were used with the streptavidin-biotin complex method. Generally, similar patterns of immunohistochemical expression were observed for TNC and FNC in the pulp tissue as a whole. In the exposure site, TNC immunostaining increased over time, exhibiting a thicker immunostaining pattern within 30 days. The imunohistochemical technique showed expression of both glycoproteins during pulp healing process.",M1
16730455,"Delayed onset of odor detection in neonatal mice lacking tenascin-C.The olfactory bulb is one of the few regions in the adult mammalian forebrain in which neurons are constitutively replaced throughout life. New neurons generated in the subventricular zone migrate long distances along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb where they differentiate into interneurons. Neuronal precursor generation, migration and incorporation into the bulbar network occur in an environment rich in extracellular matrix molecules. We investigated the potential role of one of the constituents of the extracellular matrix, tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), in bulbar neurogenesis and olfactory performance using TNC-deficient mice. We found that TNC deficiency resulted in a delayed onset of olfactory responses in neonatal animals. This delay normalized at around postnatal day 10. Interestingly, this delay in early olfactory performance was not due to impaired bulbar neurogenesis as proliferation, migration, incorporation and fate determination of newborn bulbar interneurons were normal in TNC-deficient animals. Thus, we conclude that a constitutive lack of TNC does not affect bulbar neurogenesis, but instead leads to ontogenetically early impairments in olfactory detection.",M1
16553788,"Enhanced novelty-induced activity, reduced anxiety, delayed resynchronization to daylight reversal and weaker muscle strength in tenascin-C-deficient mice.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is an extracellular matrix protein with multiple and important functions during development and in the adult. We here present a study on the behaviour of TNC-deficient (knockout, KO) mice. Longitudinal experiments including tests for circadian activity, exploration, state and trait anxiety, motor coordination and cognition were performed. KO mice showed increased reactivity to explore a novel environment and decreased anxiety. Spontaneous circadian activity was unaffected, but KO mice showed delayed resynchronization to daylight reversal. TNC deficiency caused weaker muscle strength, whereas gait, coordination and motor learning were unaltered. Short- and long-term memory in the fear conditioning task and working memory in the spontaneous alternation test were normal in KO mice. KO mice showed impaired memory recall in the step-down, but not in the step-through, passive avoidance task. Ethological observation of mice behaviour and principal component analyses indicated that the higher novelty- and stress-induced active responses of KO mice account for their poorer performance in passive avoidance tasks, whereas cognitive abilities are unaltered. The present study extends and corrects previous results, and is an example of how an ethological approach allows a precise description and interpretation of the behavioural alterations of mutant mice.",M1
16450333,"Tenascin C and annexin II expression in the process of pancreatic carcinogenesis.Tenascin C (<e>TNC</e>) is a component of the provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) that characterizes solid tumours. Cell surface annexin II is a high-affinity receptor for large TNC splice variants. The aim of this study was to analyse whether TNC and annexin II play a role in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC is characterized by a rich ECM populated by pancreatic stellate cells, which play a crucial role in pancreatic desmoplasia. The mRNA and protein levels of TNC and of annexin II were analysed in pancreatic tissues by DNA array, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. TNC large splice variants were detected by RT-PCR. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure TNC levels in serum and culture supernatants. TNC and annexin II mRNA levels were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer tissues than in the normal pancreas. TNC expression was detected with increased frequency in the progression from PanIN-1 lesions to PDAC, and a parallel switch from cytoplasmic to cell surface expression of annexin II was observed. Large TNC transcripts were found in pancreatic cancer and in chronic pancreatitis, but not in the normal pancreas. TNC expression was demonstrated in pancreatic stellate cells, where it could be induced by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and by cancer cell supernatants supplemented with TGF-beta1. In conclusion, the expression of TNC and cell surface annexin II increases in the progression from low-grade PanIN lesions to pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic stellate cells are identified as a source of TNC in pancreatic tissues, possibly under the influence of soluble factors released by the tumour cells.",M1

To reduce the incidence of recurrence by promoting clot organization, the authors designed a platinum coil coated with tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, and then histologically examined tissue responses. METHODS: Platinum coils were prepared by successive coatings with cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic heparin and then TNC or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was immobilized by affinity binding to the heparin. Six unmodified, six heparin-coated, six bFGF-coated, or eight TNC-coated platinum coils were inserted into ligated common carotid arteries (CCAs) of adult male rats, and CCA segments were harvested after 14 or 28 days. The percentages of organized areas occupying the luminal cavity in unmodified, heparin-coated, bFGF-coated, and TNC-coated groups were 4.8 +/- 4.6, 1.6 +/- 1.1, 17.9 +/- 10.7, and 93.4 +/- 6.9%, respectively. In addition, the mean lumen size in the TNC-coated group (0.35 +/- 0.23 mm2) was reduced to less than half that of the unmodified group (0.72 +/- 0.21 mm2). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells were a major cellular component of the organized tissue within the TNC-coated coils but not in the bFGF group. Collagen fibrils in the organized areas were also much thicker and denser with TNC-coated coils than with bFGF-coated coils. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of TNC-coated coils can remarkably accelerate organization of luminal cavities and reduce their volume, providing improved efficacy of these coils for endovascular embolization.",M1
16262655,"Opposite impacts of tenascin-C and tenascin-R deficiency in mice on the functional outcome of facial nerve repair.The glycoproteins tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) and tenascin-R (TNR) are extracellular matrix proteins involved in the development, plasticity and repair of the nervous system. Altered expression patterns after nerve lesions in adult animals have suggested that these molecules influence axonal regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we investigated adult mice constitutively deficient in the expression of TNC, TNR or both, using the facial nerve injury paradigm. Quantitative analysis of vibrissal movements prior to nerve transection and repair (facial-facial anastomosis) did not reveal genotype-specific differences, and thus impacts of the mutations on motor function in intact animals. Two months after nerve repair, recovery of vibrissal whisking was poor in wild-type mice, a typical finding after facial-facial anastomosis in rodents. Differential effects of the mutations on whisking were found: recovery of function was worse in TNC-deficient and better in TNR null mice compared with wild-type littermates. In double-knockout animals, vibrissal performance was insufficient, but to a lesser extent compared with TNC null mutant mice. Retrograde labelling of motoneurons in the same animals showed that similar numbers of motoneurons had reinnervated the whisker pads in all experimental groups precluding varying extents of motoneuron death and/or axon regeneration failures as causes for the different outcomes of nerve repair. Our results provide strong evidence that TNC promotes and TNR impedes recovery after nerve lesion. These findings are of particular interest with regard to the scanty knowledge about factors determining success of regeneration in the peripheral nervous system of mammals.",M1
16157221,"Tenascin-C promotes cell survival by activation of Akt in human chondrosarcoma cell.Tenascin-C (<e>TnC</e>) is an extracellular matrix protein that is highly expressed in tumor stroma. In this report, we examined the roles of TnC-mediated cell adhesion in the modulation of chondrosarcoma cell survival. We found that hTnC-mediated adhesion could confer a significant (P&lt;0.05) survival advantage to human chondrosarcoma cell line, JJ012, following serum-deprivation compared with the same cells grown on poly-lysine. This pro-survival signal was due to the activation of the Akt upon adhesion to hTnC. Moreover, hTnC-induced Akt activation was blocked by LY294002 and the expression of dominant-negative Akt. Taken together, these studies support that the TnC-mediated adhesion can promote cell survival through Akt in human chondrosarcoma cells.",M1
16115819,"Coding SNP in tenascin-C Fn-III-D domain associates with adult asthma.The extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) has been accepted as a valuable histopathological subepithelial marker for evaluating the severity of asthmatic disease and the therapeutic response to drugs. We found an association between an adult asthma and an SNP encoding TNC fibronectin type III-D (Fn-III-D) domain in a case-control study between a Japanese population including 446 adult asthmatic patients and 658 normal healthy controls. The SNP (44513A/T in exon 17) strongly associates with adult bronchial asthma (chi2 test, P=0.00019, Odds ratio=1.76, 95% confidence interval=1.31-2.36). This coding SNP induces an amino acid substitution (Leu1677Ile) within the Fn-III-D domain of the alternative splicing region. Computer-assisted protein structure modeling suggests that the substituted amino acid locates at the outer edge of the beta-sheet in Fn-III-D domain and causes instability of this beta-sheet. As the TNC fibronectin-III domain has molecular elasticity, the structural change may affect the integrity and stiffness of asthmatic airways. In addition, TNC expression in lung fibroblasts increases with Th2 immune cytokine stimulation. Thus, Leu1677Ile may be valuable marker for evaluating the risk for developing asthma and plays a role in its pathogenesis.",M1
15780469,"Tenascin-C regulates proliferation and migration of cultured astrocytes in a scratch wound assay.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is involved in tissue morphogenesis like embryogenesis, wound healing or tumorigenesis. Astrocytes are known to play major roles in wound healing in the CNS. To elucidate the roles of TNC in wound closure by astrocytes, we have examined the morphological changes of cultured astrocytes in a scratch wound assay and measured the content of soluble TNC released into the medium. We have also localized the expression of TNC mRNA, TNC, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin and integrin beta1. After wounding, glial cells rapidly released the largest TNC isoform and proliferated in the border zones. Subsequently, they became polarized with unidirectional processes and finally migrated toward the denuded area. The proliferating border zone cells and pre-migratory cells intensely expressed TNC mRNA, TNC-, vimentin-, GFAP- and integrin beta1-like immunoreactivity, while the migratory cells showed generally reduced expression except the front. Exogenous TNC enhanced cell proliferation and migration, while functional blocking with anti-TNC or anti-integrin beta1 antibody reduced both of them. These results suggest that mechanical injury induces boundary astrocytes to produce and release TNC that promotes cell proliferation and migration via integrin beta1 in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.",M1
15537675,"Structural and functional aberrations in the cerebral cortex of tenascin-C deficient mice.The extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) has been implicated in neural development and plasticity but many of its functions in vivo remain obscure. Here we addressed the question as to whether the constitutive absence of TNC in mice affects cortical physiology and structure. Defined major cell populations (neurons and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia) were quantified in the somatosensory and motor cortices of adult TNC deficient (TNC-/-) and wild-type (TNC+/+) mice by immunofluorescence labelling and stereology. In both areas studied we found abnormally high neuronal density, astrogliosis, low density of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and reduced ratios of oligodendrocytes to neurons and of inhibitory to excitatory neurons in the TNC deficient as opposed to the non-deficient animals. Analysis of Golgi-impregnated layer V pyramidal neurons in TNC-/- animals showed aberrant dendrite tortuosity and redistribution of stubby spines within first- to third-order dendritic arbors. Significantly enhanced responses upon whisker stimulation were recorded epicranially over the barrel and the motor cortices of TNC-/- as compared to TNC+/+ animals, and this effect might be associated with the diminished inhibitory circuitry. These results indicate that TNC is essential for normal cortical development and function.",M1
15059978,"Tenascin-C and SF/HGF produced by myofibroblasts in vitro provide convergent pro-invasive signals to human colon cancer cells through RhoA and Rac.Myofibroblasts are present at the invasion front in colon cancer. In an attempt to understand their putative proinvasive activity, we have developed an in vitro model. Myofibroblasts isolated from colon cancer tissue or obtained through transdifferentiation of colon fibroblasts by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulate invasion of colon cancer cells into collagen type I and Matrigel. We identified two convergent proinvasive agents secreted by myofibroblasts: namely scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) and the TGF-beta-upregulated extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), each of which is necessary though not sufficient for invasion. Myofibroblast-stimulated invasion into collagen type I is characterized by a change from a round, nonmigratory morphotype with high RhoA and low Rac activity to an elongated, migratory morphotype with low RhoA and high Rac activity. RhoA inactivation is determined by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of TNC through EGF-receptor signaling that confers a permissive and priming signal for the proinvasive activity of SF/HGF that activates Rac via c-Met. We confirmed the validity of this mechanism by using pharmacological modulators and dominant negative or constitutive active mutants that interfere with RhoA-Rho kinase and Rac signaling. Our in vitro results point to a new putative proinvasive signal for colon cancer cells provided by myofibroblasts in the tumor stroma.",M1
15024713,"Interaction between cell and extracellular matrix in heart disease: multiple roles of tenascin-C in tissue remodeling.The heart remodels myocardial tissue in physiological and pathological response. The cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction provides not only structural and mechanical support but also important biological signaling during tissue remodeling. Among various ECM molecules, tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is well known as a regulator of multiple cellular functions during embryogenesis, wound healing or cancer progression. In the heart, TNC appears in several important steps of embryonic development such as the initial differentiation of cardiomyocytes or coronary vasculo/angiogenesis, but it is not detected in a normal adult myocardium. However, TNC is found to re-express after myocardial injury and may regulate cellular behavior during tissue remodeling by modulating the attachment of cardiomyocytes to connective tissue, by enhancing migration and differentiation of myofibroblasts, and by inducing matrix metallo-proteinases. TNC also interacts with other ECM molecules and may modulate progression of fibrosis. Furthermore, transient and site specific expression of TNC closely associated with myocardial injury and inflammation suggests not only its key roles during tissue remodeling but also that TNC can be a marker for myocardial disease activity.",M1
14993772,"Tenascin-C is associated with coronary plaque instability in patients with acute coronary syndromes.BACKGROUND: Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that increases after inflammation and injury. In cultured cells TNC has been reported to markedly induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, which stimulates collagen degradation in the fibrous cap of human atherosclerotic plaque. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical techniques were used to analyze the expression of TNC protein in 51 coronary atherectomy specimens obtained from patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP, n=23) or acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (n=28; unstable angina pectoris, n=20, acute myocardial infarction, n=8). Immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD68, CD45, and CD31 was also performed in serial sections to identify the cell types that express TNC protein. The %TNC + area (percentage of the area of immunostaining for TNC protein in the total surface area of the plaque) was larger in coronary samples with the plaque characteristics of thrombus, angiogenesis, intraplaque hemorrhage, and macrophage (CD68(+)), and lymphocyte (CD45 (+)) clusters than in coronary samples without them (52+/-3.4 vs 39+/-4.8, p&lt;0.05; 57+/-3.7 vs 36+/-3.7, p&lt;0.01; 51+/-3.6 vs 39+/-4.8, p&lt;0.05; 53+/-3.4 vs 33+/-4.5, p&lt;0.01; 56+/-4.1 vs 37+/-3.6, p&lt;0.01, respectively). The presence of other components, such as dense fibrous tissue, neointimal hyperplasia, atheromatous gruel and calcification, was not significantly correlated with the %TNC + area. The %TNC + area was larger in coronary samples from patients with ACS than in samples from patients with SAP (56+/-3.2% vs 34+/-4.3%, p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that TNC may have specific functions in coronary plaque formation and may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary lesions in ACS.",M1
14568337,"Secretion of tenascin-C by cultured astrocytes: regulation of cell proliferation and process elongation.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is involved in tissue morphogenesis like embryogenesis, wound healing or tumorigenesis. Quiescent astroglia in long-term primary cultures are known to show rapid morphological changes after subculture and serum deprivation/re-addition (SSDR). To elucidate roles of TNC in the morphogenetic processes of cultured astrocytes, we have revealed morphological changes in association with soluble TNC contents in the medium and expression of TNC mRNA, TNC, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and integrin beta1, one of its cell surface receptors, in glial cells after SSDR. Soluble TNC in the medium rapidly increased in amount at 4 h when GFAP-positive cells expressed TNC mRNA, TNC and integrin beta1. Cellular proliferation and growth occurred in colonies expressing TNC mRNA, TNC and integrin beta1 during the first 24 h. During the next 24 h, process elongation and cell migration occurred in association with increased GFAP expression and re-elevation of soluble TNC in the medium. Cell bodies became flat and larger with increased GFAP and reduced TNC expression at 72 h, while cultures became confluent with reduced GFAP and TNC expression at 96 h after SSDR. Functional blocking with anti-TNC antibody reduced cell proliferation and induced morphological change from a process-bearing slender shape to a flat and wide shape presumably due to increased cell adhesion. These findings strongly support the idea that endogenous TNC produced and released by astrocytes in response to serum stimulation induces their proliferation and process elongation through a paracrine/autocrine mechanism.",M1
12926160,"Tenascin-C expression and its prognostic significance in oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Tenascin-C (Tn-C) is an extracellular matrix protein with growth-, invasion- and angiogenesis-promoting activities. It is up-regulated in tumorigenesis and has been suggested to correlate with prognosis in various carcinomas, but its significance in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of Tn-C expression in oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tn-C expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 65 consecutive tumors from patients with primary oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Based on staining intensity, both the stroma and invasion border were separately classified into two groups and the results correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: The tumor stroma showed strong Tn-C expression in 56 (86%) samples, and weak Tn-C expression in 9 (14%). At the invasion border, Tn-C expression was strong in 38 (58%) samples and weak in 27 (42%). Tn-C expression was not a statistically significant predictor of survival and there was no correlation between Tn-C expression and tumor or patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Tn-C protein was overexpressed in the majority of our oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples. The presence of <e>TnC</e> did not appear to predict for OS or DFS.",M1
12904321,"Fetal lungs of tenascin-C-deficient mice grow well, but branch poorly in organ culture.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is a multidomain extracellular matrix protein that contributes to organogenesis and tumorgenesis. To elucidate its developmental function in the context of TNC deficiency, lung lobes of TNC null mice were obtained at Embryonic Days E11.5 and E12.5 and cultured for 3 d. In lung explants of homozygote TNC-deficient embryos (E12.5) the number of future airway branches was reduced by 36% as compared with wild-type. In heterozygote explants only half of the reduction (18%) was observed. No significant alteration, neither of the explant growth nor of the pattern of airway branching, was noticed in TNC-null explants. However, the terminal endbuds of the transgenic explants were enlarged. The results are supported by a morphologic investigation at Postnatal Day P2, where the airspaces of TNC-deficient lungs appeared larger than in wild-type lungs. Taken together, our results represent the first developmental phenotype of TNC-null mice. We conclude that TNC takes part in the control of fetal lung branching, and that not only the presence of TNC but also its amount is important. Because TNC is predominantly expressed at the growing tip of the future airways, we hypothesize that TNC promotes the penetration into the surrounding mesenchyme and the branching of the growing airways.",M1
12823230,"The dynamic expression of tenascin-C and tenascin-X during early heart development in the mouse.One of a family of extracellular matrix proteins, tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is expressed in a spatiotemporally restricted pattern associated with tissue remodeling during embryonic development, wound healing, cancer invasion and tissue regeneration. Another form, tenascin-X (TNX), is found in most tissues but most predominantly in heart and muscle, often complementarily to TNC. The present analysis demonstrated their expression during early heart development, using mouse lines containing the lacZ gene targeted to the TNC locus, by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. TNC was transiently expressed at important steps during heart development: (1) precardiac mesodermal cells differentiating to cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells at E 7.5 - 8.5; (2) cardiomyocytes in the outflow tract at E 8.5 - 12; (3) endocardial cells forming cushion tissue at E 9.5 - 13; and (4) mesenchymal cells in the proepicardial organ (PEO), the precursors of coronary vessels, at E 9.5. When PEO cells were transferred onto the heart surface, the expression of TNC was downregulated, while TNX was upregulated at E 11. Initially, epicardial cells around the AV groove and atrium started to express TNX. TNX-positive cells then gradually spread all over the entire surface of the heart and invaded and formed primitive vascular channels in the myocardium. Despite restricted expression at important sites and steps during cardiogenesis, the hearts of TNC deficient mice developed normally. No difference in the expression pattern of TNX were observed in TNC knockout and wild mice. These results suggest; (1) TNC could play important roles in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes and the early morphogenesis of the heart; (2) TNX could be involved in coronary vasculogenesis; (3) TNX does not compensate for the loss of TNC.",M1
12557222,"Induction of tenascin-C by tumor-specific EWS-ETS fusion genes.Ewing sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are associated with a chromosomal translocation resulting in a fusion of the amino-terminus of EWS with the DNA-binding domain of an ETS transcription factor (most commonly FLI1 or ERG). Although previous reports suggested that these chimera proteins would act as aberrant transcription factors, their downstream targets have not been fully elucidated. To identify downstream targets of these EWS-ETS fusion proteins, we introduced EWS-ETS fusion constructs into a human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT-1080, by retroviral transduction. Here we report that Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is induced to a significantly higher level in cells expressing EWS-ETSs than in cells expressing normal ETSs. Furthermore, through use of an antisense cDNA expression vector we show that expression of endogenous TNC mRNA and protein were reduced coordinately with attenuation of EWS-FLI1 fusion protein expression. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed direct interaction between the TNC promoter and the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in vivo. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay revealed that EWS-ETSs upregulated the TNC gene through four ETS binding sites in the TNC promoter. High levels of TNC expression were observed in a subset of ES cell lines (3 of 6) and primary tumors (4 of 6). Together with previous studies showing that TNC expression is involved in the invasive and malignant phenotype of several tumor types, our data suggest that the oncogenic effect of EWS-ETS may be mediated in part by upregulating of TNC expression.",M1
12359049,"Invasion of melanoma in double knockout mice lacking tenascin-X and tenascin-C.The roles of extracellular matrix glycoproteins belonging to the tenascin family in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis are not known. To address this issue, we generated tenascin-X (TNX) and tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) double knockout mice and compared findings in these mice with those in single knockout (TNX + / + TNC - / - and TNX - / - TNC + / +) mice. We investigated the proliferation and invasion of B16-BL6 melanoma cells after these cells had been injected into the footpads of mice in each group. The primary tumor size and invasion to the ankle adjacent to the primary tumor site were examined at 35 days after injection of the melanoma cells. The primary tumor size in TNX - / - TNC + / + mice was significantly larger than that in wild-type mice, but those of TNX + / + TNC - / - and double knockout mice were comparable to that in the wild-type mice. On the other hand, invasion to the ankle was obviously promoted in TNX - / - TNC + / + and double knockout mice compared with that in the wild-type mice, but invasion to the ankle in TNX + / + TNC - / - mice was only slightly promoted. Gelatin zymography confirmed increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity in the dorsal skin of TNX - / - TNC + / +, TNX + / + TNC - / - and double knockout mice. However, the amounts of MMP-9 mRNA in the dorsal skins of all mice were almost the same, indicating that the increased activity of MMP-9 in the single and double knockout mice is regulated at the MMP-9 processing level. These results indicate that MMP-9 is activated in all TN-deficient mice, but that TNX exerts a greater effect on tumor invasion than does TNC.",M1
12221059,"Detection of experimental autoimmune myocarditis in rats by 111In monoclonal antibody specific for tenascin-C.BACKGROUND: Although the identification of inflammatory infiltrates in endomyocardial biopsy specimens is necessary for the definite diagnosis of myocarditis, the biopsy test is invasive and is not sensitive. Therefore, a new diagnostic technique for the early and noninvasive evaluation of myocarditis has been awaited. Expression of tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>), one of the oligometric extracellular glycoproteins, is induced in various pathological states, including inflammation, suggesting that TNC can be a molecular marker of myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: An 111In anti-TNC monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment was injected intravenously into rats with experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM), and the biodistribution of this radiotracer was measured. Rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood was observed in both EAM and control rats (&lt;1% at 6 hours after injection). Myocardial uptake of the tracer was much higher in EAM rats than in control rats (7.54-, 4.39-, and 3.51-fold at 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection, respectively). By autoradiography, high radioactivities were clearly observed in the regions indicative of inflammation in EAM rats. Single-photon emission CT imaging demonstrated the focal myocardial uptake of 111In anti-TNC Fab' in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabeled anti-TNC Fab' may be useful for the noninvasive diagnosis of myocarditis.",M1

In the normal human adult, TNC is found in large concentrations in articular cartilage, suggesting tissue-specific function. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific in vitro TNC splicing patterns of articular chondrocytes and a human chondrosarcoma cell line. Cells were cultured in a three-dimensional bead system and TNC splice variant expression and distribution were examined with the use of Western blotting techniques, semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. At both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, the chondrocytes were found to express significantly higher levels of the smaller 220 kDa isoform (P &lt; 0.01), which was predominantly incorporated into the matrix. The splicing pattern of the malignant cells was characterized by a higher proportion of the larger 320 kDa isoform which was extruded into the media. In vivo studies are necessary to verify the expression of the large TNC isoform in chondrosarcoma and the production and integration of the smaller isoform in normal chondroid matrix. In addition, elucidation of the biologic functions of the two major TNC isoforms may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to chondrosarcoma.",M1
12115886,"Tenascin-C is a useful marker for disease activity in myocarditis.Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is an extracellular matrix protein which appears at active sites of tissue remodelling during embryogenesis or cancer invasion. In normal heart, TNC is only present during the early stages of development but reappears in pathological states. This study examined the diagnostic value of TNC for assessing disease activity of myocarditis. Expression of TNC was examined in myosin-induced autoimmune myocarditis mouse models. Sequential changes in amount, localization and the producing cells were analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and compared with the histological picture. The expression of TNC was upregulated at a very early stage of myocarditis. Immunostaining was detectable before cell infiltration and myocytolysis became histologically apparent, remained during the active stage while cell infiltration and necrosis continued, and disappeared in scar tissue with healing. TNC immunostaining was always observed at the periphery of necrotic or degenerating cardiomyocytes in foci of inflammation, the expression level correlating with histological evidence of inflammatory activity. Interstitial fibroblasts were the major source of TNC, expressing the large isoform containing alternative splicing sites. These data demonstrate that TNC is a useful marker for evaluation of disease activity in myocarditis.",M1
12009782,"Tenascin-C expression and splice variant in habu snake venom-induced glomerulonephritis.Extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) expression is up-regulated in tissue remodeling processes such as tumorigenesis and wound healing. Mouse tenascin-C contains six alternatively spliced domains (A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D) between the fifth and the sixth type III fibronectin domains, which generate large numbers of TNC isoforms. To study TNC isoform variability of wound healing in mice, we induced glomerulonephritis by using Habu snake venom (HSV) and examined alternatively spliced regions by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. RT-PCR products were separated into seven bands in both healthy and diseased kidneys. Among the seven bands, those containing one or five alternatively spliced domains were mainly up-regulated from 2 days to 1 week after HSV injection. Southern blotting revealed that only domain-D detected all six bands in both healthy and diseased kidneys. Furthermore, only the domain-C transcriptional level did not show an obvious change in progress following HSV injection. These results suggested that (a) the isoforms containing one or five alternatively spliced domains play important roles in the healing process of glomerulonephritis, (b) domain-D is particularly significant in kidney, and (c) domain-C may not play an important role in the healing process of HSV-induced glomerulonephritis.",M1

In this study, we examined the relationship of TNC and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) in glomerular mesangial cells. TNC and PDGFR-alpha and -beta transcriptions were up-regulated in wild type (WT) mice after HSV injection, but in TNKO mice PDGFR-alpha transcription was not up-regulated. Immunohistochemistry showed that PDGFR-alpha was found in mesangial areas of colocalized alpha-smooth muscle actin, but in TNKO mice it was not detectable. In vitro studies showed that the expressions of PDGFR-alpha and -beta mRNA and protein in cultured glomerular mesangial cells (GMC) of TNKO mice were lower than those in WT GMC. These results suggest that failures of both TNC and PDGFR-alpha are a candidate for abnormal restoration of TNKO mice.",M1
11721178,"The clinical significance of tenascin-C splice variant expression in chondrosarcoma.OBJECTIVES: Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is an oligomeric glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix that is prominently expressed in malignant tumors. The purpose of this study was: (1) to determine the in vitro TNC splicing pattern in cultured human chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells, (2) to determine the in vivo TNC splicing pattern in clinical chondrosarcoma specimens, and (3) to perform survival analysis based on the TNC splicing pattern of the tumor specimens. METHODS: Human articular chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells (cell line JJ012) were grown in a three-dimensional alginate bead system and harvested at two time points. Semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the in vitro TNC splicing pattern for the two cell types. Clinical chondrosarcoma specimens were obtained intra-operatively and underwent RT-PCR to determine the in vivo TNC splicing pattern. Specific immunohistochemical staining for the large TNC splice variant was performed on the clinical specimens. Survival analysis was used to determine the association between the specific TNC splicing pattern and survival. RESULTS: The in vitro mRNA expression pattern of TNC in normal human articular chondrocytes was characterized by a high ratio of the small to the large splice variant (TNC(small):TNC(large)), whereas the in vitro mRNA expression pattern for cultured chondrosarcoma cells was characterized by a low TNC(small):TNC(large) ratio. Clinical chondrosarcoma specimens with a lower TNC(small):TNC(large) ratio showed a trend towards decreased survival. The TNC splicing pattern of these specimens was verified through specific immunohistochemical staining for the large TNC isoform. CONCLUSIONS: The specific TNC splicing pattern may have clinical significance in chondrosarcoma. TNC expression may therefore play a future role in objective tumor grading and novel therapeutic approaches to this malignancy.",M1
11565810,"Tenascin-C splice variant adhesive/anti-adhesive effects on chondrosarcoma cell attachment to fibronectin.Tenascin-C is an oligomeric glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix that has been found to have both adhesive and anti-adhesive properties for cells. Recent elucidation of the two major <e>TNC</e> splice variants (320 kDa and 220 kDa) has shed light on the possibility of varying functions of the molecule based on its splicing pattern. Tenascin-C is prominently expressed in embryogenesis and in pathologic conditions such as tumorogenesis and wound healing. Fibronectin is a prominent adhesive molecule of the extracellular matrix that is often co-localized with tenascin-C in these processes. We studied the chondrosarcoma cell line JJ012 with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assays, cell attachment assays and antibody-blocking assays to determine the adhesive/anti-adhesive properties of the two major tenascin-C splice variants with respect to fibronectin and their effect on chondrosarcoma cell attachment. We found that the small tenascin-C splice variant (220 kDa) binds to fibronectin, whereas the large tenascin-C splice variant (320 kDa) does not. In addition, the small tenascin-C splice variant was found to decrease adhesion for cells when bound to fibronectin, but contributed to adhesion when bound to plastic in fibronectin-coated wells. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed that both the small tenascin-C splice variant and fibronectin contribute to cell adhesion when bound to plastic. The large tenascin-C splice variant did not promote specific cell attachment. We hypothesize that the biologic activity of tenascin-C is dependent on the tissue-specific splicing pattern. The smaller tenascin-C isoform likely plays a structural and adhesive role, whereas the larger isoform, preferentially expressed in malignant tissue, likely plays a role in cell egress and metastasis.",M1

The present study was designed to clarify the contribution of TNC to ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. We examined the expression of TNC after experimental myocardial infarction in the rat by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Within 24 hours of permanent coronary ligation, interstitial fibroblasts in the border zone started to express TNC mRNA. The expression of TNC was down-regulated on Day 7 and was no longer apparent by Day 14 after infarction. During the healing process, TNC protein and TNC-producing cells were found at the edges of the residual myocardium. Some of the TNC-producing cells were immunoreactive for alpha-smooth muscle actin. In culture, TNC increased the number of cardiomyocytes attached to laminin but inhibited the formation of focal contacts at costameres. The results indicate that during the acute phase after myocardial infarction, interstitial cells in the border zone synthesize TNC, which may loosen the strong adhesion of surviving cardiomyocytes to connective tissue and thereby facilitate tissue reorganization.",M1
11216993,"Adventitial remodeling after angioplasty is associated with expression of tenascin mRNA by adventitial myofibroblasts.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the temporospatial expression of tenascin-C (<e>TnC</e>) in balloon-injured rat and porcine arteries. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that cell migration, in addition to cell proliferation, is a critical component of neointima formation after vascular injury. We have previously shown that adventitial myofibroblasts synthesize growth factors that contribute to the formation of neointima after arterial injury. We have also shown that the extracellular matrix protein, TnC, regulates cell migration. Consequently, we investigated the temporospatial expression of TnC by myofibroblasts after vascular injury. METHODS: In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the temporospatial expression of TnC in injured arteries. Northern and Western blots were used to determine the in vitro expression of TnC. RESULTS: In situ hybridization revealed that the major site of TnC expression early after vascular injury was the adventitial myofibroblasts. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that TnC expression began in adventitial myofibroblasts three days after injury. Tenascin-C expression, however, did not persist in this region. Rather, it moved progressively across the vascular wall toward the luminal surface. By one week, TnC expression reached the developing neointima. In vitro, myofibroblasts did not express TnC mRNA under basal conditions. In contrast, angiotensin II and PDGF-BB, factors that have been implicated in remodeling of balloon-injured arteries, markedly upregulated TnC mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Tenascin-C is expressed in response to balloon injury. Tenascin-C expression begins with adventitial myofibroblasts. Over a period of 7 to 14 days, expression moves progressively across the vessel wall to the neointima. We hypothesize that adventitial myofibroblasts are actively involved in the formation of neointima and that TnC facilitates migration of these cells during adventitial remodeling.",M1
10555287,"Concerted evolution of exons and introns in the MHC-linked tenascin-X gene of mammals.Two modes of evolution of repeated domains in proteins have been described: (1) a conservative mode, whereby individual domains are conserved across gene duplication and speciation events, and (2) a concerted mode, whereby repeat domains become homogenized within a gene, presumably by intragenic partial duplication and/or gene conversion. The evolution of repeated EGF-like and fibronection-type-III-like (Fn-III) domains in the vertebrate extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-X (TNX) and tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) was studied by comparisons between human and mouse orthologs and between the paralogous TNC and TNX genes. The EGF-like repeats have largely been homogenized within each gene by concerted evolution since the duplication of the two genes but have been conserved since the divergence of rodents and primates. The Fn-III domains of TNC have likewise mainly evolved in a conservative fashion since the divergence of rodents and primates. In contrast, the Fn-III repeats of TNX fall into three distinct categories with regard to mode of evolution: (1) The three C-terminal repeats have been conserved since before duplication of the TNX and TNC genes. (2) Certain other repeats have been homogenized within each gene since gene duplication but have been conserved since the divergence of rodents and primates. (3) Still other repeats have evolved in a concerted fashion in rodent and primate lineages since their divergence. Remarkably, certain introns adjacent to the exons encoding these concertedly evolving Fn-III repeats have themselves evolved in a concerted fashion. This is the first known example of concerted evolution of repeated introns within a protein-coding gene.",M1
10341205,"Tenascin-C modulates tumor stroma and monocyte/macrophage recruitment but not tumor growth or metastasis in a mouse strain with spontaneous mammary cancer.The local growth of tumors and their ability to metastasize are crucially dependent on their interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix. Tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>) is an extracellular matrix protein which is highly expressed during development, tissue repair and cancer. Despite the high levels of TNC in the stroma of primary and metastatic tumors, the function of TNC is not known. In the present study we have crossed TNC-null mice with a mouse strain where both female and male mice spontaneously develop mammary tumors followed by metastatic disease in the lungs. We report that the absence of TNC had no effect on the temporal occurrence of mammary tumors and their metastatic dissemination in lungs. Furthermore, the number and size of tumors, the number and size of metastatic foci in the lungs, the proliferation rate and apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor angiogenesis were not altered in the absence of TNC. Histological examination revealed that the tumor organisation, however, was modulated by TNC. In the presence of TNC both primary as well as metastatic tumors were organised in large tumor cell nests surrounded by thick layers of extracellular matrix proteins. In the absence of TNC these tumor cell nests were smaller but still separated from each other by extracellular matrix proteins. In addition, the TNC-null stromal compartment contained significantly more monocytes/macrophages than tumor stroma from TNC wild-type mice. Using in vitro coculture experiments we show that TNC-null tumor cells were still able to activate the TNC gene in fibroblasts which express low basal levels of TNC. Altogether these data indicate that TNC has a very limited role during the spontaneous development and growth of mamary tumors and their metastasis to the lungs.",M1
9288108,"Tenascin-X deficiency is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.The tenascins are a family of large extracellular matrix proteins with at least three members: tenascin-X (TNX), tenascin-C (<e>TNC</e>, or cytotactin) and tenascin-R (TN-R, or restrictin). Although the tenascins have been implicated in a number of important cellular processes, no function has been clearly established for any tenascin. We describe a new contiguous-gene syndrome, involving the CYP21B and TNX genes, that results in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and a connective-tissue disorder consisting of skin and joint hyperextensibility, vascular fragility and poor wound healing. The connective tissue findings are typical of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The abundant expression of TNX in connective tissues is consistent with a role in EDS, and our patient's skin fibroblasts do not synthesize TNX protein in vitro or in vivo. His paternal allele carries a novel deletion arising from recombination between TNX and its partial duplicate gene, XA, which precludes TNX synthesis. Absence of TNX mRNA and protein in the proband, mapping of the TNX gene and HLA typing of this family suggest recessive inheritance of TNX deficiency and connective-tissue disease. Although the precise role of TNX in the pathogenesis of EDS is uncertain, this patient's findings suggest a unique and essential role for TNX in connective-tissue structure and function.",M1
20128626,"Effect of calcium-sensitizing mutations on calcium binding and exchange with troponin C in increasingly complex biochemical systems.The calcium-dependent interactions between troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and other thin and thick filament proteins play a key role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Five hydrophobic residues (Phe(20), Val(44), Met(45), Leu(48), and Met(81)) in the regulatory domain of TnC were individually substituted with polar Gln, to examine the effect of these mutations that sensitized isolated TnC to calcium on (1) the calcium binding and exchange with TnC in increasingly complex biochemical systems and (2) the calcium sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase. The hydrophobic residue mutations drastically affected calcium binding and exchange with TnC in increasingly complex biochemical systems, indicating that side chain intra- and intermolecular interactions of these residues play a crucial role in determining how TnC responds to calcium. However, the mutations that sensitized isolated TnC to calcium did not necessarily increase the calcium sensitivity of the troponin (Tn) complex or reconstituted thin filaments with or without myosin S1. Furthermore, the calcium sensitivity of reconstituted thin filaments (in the absence of myosin S1) was a better predictor of the calcium dependence of actomyosin ATPase activity than that of TnC or the Tn complex. Thus, both the intrinsic properties of TnC and its interactions with the other contractile proteins play a crucial role in modulating the binding of calcium to TnC in increasingly complex biochemical systems.",M2
20104876,"Solution structure of the Apo C-terminal domain of the Lethocerus F1 troponin C isoform.Muscle contraction is activated by two distinct mechanisms. One depends on the calcium influx, and the other is calcium-independent and activated by mechanical stress. A prototypical example of stretch activation is observed in insect muscles. In Lethocerus, a model system ideally suited for studying stretch activation, the two mechanisms seem to be under the control of different isoforms of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), F1 and F2, which are responsible for stretch and calcium-dependent regulation, respectively. We have previously shown that F1 TnC is a typical collapsed dumbbell EF-hand protein that accommodates one calcium ion in its fourth EF-hand. When calcium loaded, the C-terminal domain of F1 TnC is in an open conformation which allows binding to troponin I. We have determined the solution structure of the isolated F1 TnC C-terminal domain in the absence of calcium and have compared it together with its dynamical properties with those of the calcium-loaded form. The domain is folded also in the absence of calcium and is in a closed conformation. Binding of a single calcium is sufficient to induce a modest but clear closed-to-open conformational transition and releases the conformational entropy observed in the calcium-free form. These results provide the first example of a TnC domain in which the presence of only one calcium ion is sufficient to induce a closed-to-open transition and clarify the role of calcium in stretch activation.",M2
20100491,"Regulation of oscillatory contraction in insect flight muscle by troponin.Insect indirect flight muscle is activated by sinusoidal length change, which enables the muscle to work at high frequencies, and contracts isometrically in response to Ca(2+). Indirect flight muscle has two <e>TnC</e> isoforms: F1 binding a single Ca(2+) in the C-domain, and F2 binding Ca(2+) in the N- and C-domains. Fibres substituted with F1 produce delayed force in response to a single rapid stretch, and those with F2 produce isometric force in response to Ca(2+). We have studied the effect of TnC isoforms on oscillatory work. In native Lethocerus indicus fibres, oscillatory work was superimposed on a level of isometric force that depended on Ca(2+) concentration. Maximum work was produced at pCa 6.1; at higher concentrations, work decreased as isometric force increased. In fibres substituted with F1 alone, work continued to rise as Ca(2+) was increased up to pCa 4.7. Fibres substituted with various F1:F2 ratios produced maximal work at a ratio of 100:1 or 50:1; a higher proportion of F2 increased isometric force at the expense of oscillatory work. The F1:F2 ratio was 9.8:1 in native fibres, as measured by immunofluorescence, using isoform-specific antibodies. The small amount of F2 needed to restore work to levels obtained for the native fibre is likely to be due to the relative affinity of F1 and F2 for TnH, the Lethocerus homologue of TnI. Affinity of TnC isoforms for a TnI fragment of TnH was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The K(d) was 1.01 muM for F1 binding and 22.7 nM for F2. The higher affinity of F2 can be attributed to two TnH binding sites on F2 and a single site on F1. Stretch may be sensed by an extended C-terminal domain of TnH, resulting in reversible dissociation of the inhibitory sequence from actin during the oscillatory cycle.",M2
19920153,"Troponin regulatory function and dynamics revealed by H/D exchange-mass spectrometry.Muscle contraction is tightly regulated by Ca(2+) binding to the thin filament protein troponin. The mechanism of this regulation was investigated by detailed mapping of the dynamic properties of cardiac troponin using amide hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry. Results were obtained in the presence of either saturation or non-saturation of the regulatory Ca(2+) binding site in the NH(2) domain of subunit <e>TnC</e>. Troponin was found to be highly dynamic, with 60% of amides exchanging H for D within seconds of exposure to D(2)O. In contrast, portions of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil exhibited high protection from exchange, despite 6 h in D(2)O. The data indicate that the most stable portion of the trimeric troponin complex is the coiled-coil. Regulatory site Ca(2+) binding altered dynamic properties (i.e. H/D exchange protection) locally, near the binding site and in the TnI switch helix that attaches to the Ca(2+)-saturated TnC NH(2) domain. More notably, Ca(2+) also altered the dynamic properties of other parts of troponin: the TnI inhibitory peptide region that binds to actin, the TnT-TnI coiled-coil, and the TnC COOH domain that contains the regulatory Ca(2+) sites in many invertebrate as opposed to vertebrate troponins. Mapping of these affected regions onto the troponin highly extended structure suggests that cardiac troponin switches between alternative sets of intramolecular interactions, similar to previous intermediate resolution x-ray data of skeletal muscle troponin.",M2
19175017,"[Curve-fit with hybrid logistic function for intracellular calcium transient]As the left ventricular (LV) pressure curve and myocardial tension curve in heart are composed of contraction and relaxation processes, we have found that hybrid logistic (HL) function calculated as the difference between two logistic functions curve-fits better the isovolumic LV pressure curve and the isometric twitch tension curve than the conventional polynomial exponential and sinusoidal functions. Increase and decrease in intracellular Ca2+ concentration regulate myocardial contraction and relaxation. Recently, we reported that intracellular Ca2+ transient (CaT) curves measured using the calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein, aequorin, were better curve-fitted by HL function compared to the polynomial exponential function in the isolated rabbit RV and mouse LV papillary muscles. We speculate that the first logistic component curve of HL fit represents the concentration of the Ca2+ inflow into the cytoplasmic space, the concentration of Ca2+ released from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the concentration of Ca2+ binding to troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), and the attached number of cross-bridge (CB) and their time courses, and that the second logistic component curve of HL fit represents the concentration of Ca2+ sequestered into SR, the concentration of Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasmic space, the concentration of Ca2+ released from TnC, and the detached number of CB and their time courses. This HL approach for CaT curve may provide a more useful model for investigating Ca2+ handling, Ca(2+) -TnC interaction, and CB cycling.",M2
19015190,"Calcium- and myosin-dependent changes in troponin structure during activation of heart muscle.Each heartbeat is triggered by a pulse of intracellular calcium ions which bind to troponin on the actin-containing thin filaments of heart muscle cells, initiating a change in filament structure that allows myosin to bind and generate force. We investigated the molecular mechanism of calcium regulation in demembranated trabeculae from rat ventricle using polarized fluorescence from probes on troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). Native TnC was replaced by double-cysteine mutants of human cardiac TnC with bifunctional rhodamine attached along either the C helix, adjacent to the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding site, or the E helix in the IT arm of the troponin complex. Changes in the orientation of both troponin helices had the same steep Ca(2+) dependence as active force production, with a Hill coefficient (n(H)) close to 3, consistent with a single co-operative transition controlled by Ca(2+) binding. Complete inhibition of active force by 25 microM blebbistatin had very little effect on the Ca(2+)-dependent structural changes and in particular did not significantly reduce the value of n(H). Binding of rigor myosin heads to thin filaments following MgATP depletion in the absence of Ca(2+) also changed the orientation of the C and E helices, and addition of Ca(2+) in rigor produced further changes characterized by increased Ca(2+) affinity but with n(H) close to 1. These results show that, although myosin binding can switch on thin filaments in rigor conditions, it does not contribute significantly under physiological conditions. The physiological mechanism of co-operative Ca(2+) regulation of cardiac contractility must therefore be intrinsic to the thin filaments.",M2
18986304,"Phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I by mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1.Mst1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase and its activation in the heart causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Its myocardial substrates, however, remain unknown. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library with a dominant-negative Mst1 (K59R) mutant used as bait, cTn [cardiac Tn (troponin)] I was identified as an Mst1-interacting protein. The interaction of cTnI with Mst1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in both co-transfected HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) and native cardiomyocytes, in which cTnI interacted with full-length Mst1, but not with its N-terminal kinase fragment. in vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that cTnI is a sensitive substrate for Mst1. In contrast, cTnT was phosphorylated by Mst1 only when it was incorporated into the Tn complex. MS analysis indicated that Mst1 phosphorylates cTnI at Thr(31), Thr(51), Thr(129) and Thr(143). Substitution of Thr(31) with an alanine residue reduced Mst1-mediated cTnI phosphorylation by 90%, whereas replacement of Thr(51), Thr(129) or Thr(143) with alanine residues reduced Mst1-catalysed cTnI phosphorylation by approx. 60%, suggesting that Thr(31) is a preferential phosphorylation site for Mst1. Furthermore, treatment of cardiomyocytes with hydrogen peroxide rapidly induced Mst1-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI at Thr(31). Protein epitope analysis and binding assays showed that Mst1-mediated phosphorylation modulates the molecular conformation of cTnI and its binding affinity to TnT and <e>TnC</e>, thus indicating functional significances. The results of the present study suggest that Mst1 is a novel mediator of cTnI phosphorylation in the heart and may contribute to the modulation of myofilament function under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",M2
18803402,"The dilated cardiomyopathy G159D mutation in cardiac troponin C weakens the anchoring interaction with troponin I.NMR spectroscopy has been employed to elucidate the molecular consequences of the DCM G159D mutation on the structure and dynamics of troponin C, and its interaction with troponin I (TnI). Since the molecular effects of human mutations are often subtle, all NMR experiments were conducted as direct side-by-side comparisons of the wild-type C-domain of troponin C (cCTnC) and the mutant protein, G159D. With the mutation, the affinity toward the anchoring region of cTnI (cTnI 34-71) was reduced ( K D = 3.0 +/- 0.6 microM) compared to that of the wild type ( K D &lt; 1 microM). Overall, the structure and dynamics of the G159D.cTnI 34-71 complex were very similar to those of the cCTnC.cTnI 34-71 complex. There were, however, significant changes in the (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N NMR chemical shifts, especially for the residues in direct contact with cTnI 34-71, and the changes in NOE connectivity patterns between the G159D.cTnI 34-71 and cCTnC.cTnI 34-71 complexes. Thus, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that the development of disease results from the poor anchoring of cTnI to cCTnC, with the resulting increase in the level of acto-myosin inhibition in agreement with physiological data. Another possibility is that long-range electrostatic interactions affect the binding of the inhibitory and switch regions of cTnI (cTnI 128-147 and cTnI 147-163) and/or the cardiac specific N-terminus of cTnI (cTnI 1-29) to the N-domain of cTnC. These important interactions are all spatially close in the X-ray structure of the cardiac <e>TnC</e> core.",M2
18689462,"Free-energy linkage between folding and calcium binding in EF-hand proteins.Troponin is the singular Ca(2+)-sensitive protein in the contraction of vertebrate striated muscles. Troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), the Ca(2+)-binding subunit of the troponin complex, has two distinct domains, C and N, which have different properties despite their extensive structural homology. In this work, we analyzed the thermodynamic stability of the isolated N-domain of TnC using a fluorescent mutant with Phe 29 replaced by Trp (F29W/N-domain, residues 1-90). The complete unfolding of the N-domain of TnC in the absence or presence of Ca(2+) was achieved by combining high hydrostatic pressure and urea, a maneuver that allowed us to calculate the thermodynamic parameters (DeltaV and DeltaG(atm)). In this study, we propose that part of the affinity for Ca(2+) is contributed by the free-energy change of folding of the N- and C-domains that takes place when Ca(2+) binds. The importance of the free-energy change for the structural and regulatory functions of the TnC isolated domains was evaluated. Our results shed light on how the coupling between folding and ion binding contributes to the fine adjustment of the affinity for Ca(2+) in EF-hand proteins, which is crucial to function.",M2
18393534,"Volume and free energy of folding for troponin C C-domain: linkage to ion binding and N-domain interaction.Troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) is an 18-kDa acidic protein of the EF-hand family that serves as the trigger for muscle contraction. In this study, we investigated the thermodynamic stability of the C-domain of TnC in all its occupancy states (apo, Mg (2+)-, and Ca (2+)-bound states) using a fluorescent mutant with Phe 105 replaced by Trp (F105W/C-domain, residues 88-162) and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. High hydrostatic pressure was employed as a perturbing agent, in combination with urea or without it. On the basis of changes in Trp emission, the C-domain apo state was denatured by pressure (in the range of 1-1000 bar) in the absence of urea. The fluorescence data were corroborated by following the changes in the (1)H NMR signal of Histidine 128. Addition of Ca (2+) or Mg (2+) increased the C-domain stability so that complete denaturation was attained only by the combined use of high hydrostatic pressure and either 7-8 M or 1.5-2 M urea, respectively. The (1)H NMR spectra in the presence of Ca (2+) was typical of a highly structured protein and allowed us to follow the changes in the local environment of several amino-acid residues as a function of pressure at 4 M Urea. Different residues presented different volume changes, but those that are in the hydrophobic core portrayed values very similar to that obtained for tryptophan 105 as measured by fluorescence, indicating that it is indeed a good probe for the overall tertiary structure. From these experiments, we calculated the thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees atm and Delta V) that govern the folding of the C-domain in all its possible physiological states and constructed a thermodynamic cycle. Furthermore, a comparison of the volume and free-energy changes of folding of isolated C-domain with those of intact TnC (F105W) revealed that the N-domain has little effect on the structure of the C-domain, even in the presence of Ca (2+). The volume and free-energy diagrams reveal a landscape of different conformations from the less structured, denatured apo form to the highly structured, Ca (2+)-bound form. The large change in folding free energy of the C-domain that takes place when Ca (2+) binds may explain the much higher Ca (2+) affinity of sites III and IV, 2 orders of magnitude higher than the affinity of sites I and II.",M2
18386050,"Modulation of troponin C affinity for the thin filament by different cross-bridge states in skinned skeletal muscle fibers.In vertebrate skeletal muscle, the C-domain of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) serves as an anchor; the N-domain regulates the position of troponin-tropomyosin on the thin filament after changes in intracellular Ca2+. Another type of thin-filament regulation is provided by cross-bridges. In this study, we use skinned fibers reconstituted with chicken recombinant TnC (rTnC) to examine TnC-thin filament affinity when cross-bridges containing different ligands are formed. Dissociation and equilibrium binding of apo-TnC (i.e., lacking divalent cations) under different conditions were monitored by a standard test for maximum tension (P (o)). After 10 min in low-Mg2+ relaxing solution, rTnC dissociation (i.e., tension loss) was 80% vs only 45% in rigor. In rigor, adding myosin subfragment 1 (S1) reduced dissociation approximately twofold, whereas stretching to reduce filament overlap increased dissociation to nearly the value for relaxed fibers. Dissociation of rTnC after addition of Pi or MgADP to form A.M.Pi or A.M.ADP cross-bridges was significantly greater than with rigor (A.M) bridges. The increase in P (o) during equilibration with different concentrations of rTnC showed that the affinity for rTnC binding to the thin filament increased progressively with stronger cross-bridges: rTnC concentrations for half-maximal reconstitution (K (0.5)) were 8.1, 3.7, 2.9, and 1.1 microM for A + M.ADP.Pi, A.M.Pi, A.M, and A.M + S1. Cross-bridges containing MgADP(-) (A.M.ADP) were also less effective than rigor bridges in promoting rTnC binding. We conclude that cross-bridge state and number both modulate TnC affinity for the thin filament and that the TnC C-domain is a central element in this pathway.",M2
18286628,"Infrared spectroscopic study of the binding of divalent cations to Akazara scallop troponin C: the effect of the methylene side chain of glutamate residue.Akazara scallop striated adductor muscle troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) binds only one Ca2+ because the three EF-hand motifs are short of critical residues for the coordination of Ca2+. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to study coordination structures of M2+ (= Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) bound in an Akazara scallop TnC mutant (E142D) and the wild-type TnC C-lobe in D2O solution. The region of the COO- antisymmetric stretch provides information regarding the coordination modes of a COO- group to a metal ion. The side chain COO- group of Asp142 did not bind to Ca2+ in the bidentate coordination mode, suggesting that the absence of a methylene group is critical for the Ca2+ coordination structure of Akazara scallop TnC (Nara et al., Vib Spect 2006, 42, 188-191). The present study has shown that the absence of a methylene group is not compensated for by a larger metal ion such as Sr2+ or Ba2+. CD spectra showed that the secondary structures are conserved between M2+-free (apo), Mg2+-loaded, Ca2+-loaded, Sr2+-loaded, and Ba2+-loaded states, which was consistent with the results estimated from their amide I band patterns. The metal-ligand interaction at position 12 of site IV is discussed in comparison with the coordination mode of the side chain COO- group of the wild-type TnC C-lobe.",M2
18231806,"Differential effects of a green tea-derived polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on the acidosis-induced decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac and skeletal muscle.(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a green tea-derived polyphenol, has received much attention as a protective agent against cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we determined its effects on the acidosis-induced change in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of myofilaments in myofibrils prepared from porcine ventricular myocardium and chicken pectoral muscle. EGCg (0.1 mM) significantly inhibited the decrease caused by lowering the pH from 7.0 to 6.0 in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity in cardiac muscle, but not in skeletal muscle. Studies on recombinant mouse cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and chicken fast skeletal troponin C (sTnC) using circular dichroism and intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy showed that EGCg bound to cTnC with a dissociation constant of approximately 3-4 muM, but did not bind to sTnC. By presumably binding to the cTnC C-lobe, EGCg decreased Ca(2+) binding to cTnC and overcame the depressant effect of protons on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the cardiac contractile response. To demonstrate isoform-specific effects of the action of EGCg, the pH sensitivity of the Ca(2+) response was examined in cardiac myofibrils in which endogenous cTnC was replaced with exogenous sTnC or cTnC and in skeletal myofibrils in which the endogenous sTn complex was replaced with whole cardiac Tn complex (cTn). The results suggest that the binding of EGCg to the cardiac isoform-specific <e>TnC</e> or Tn complex alters the effect of pH on myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in striated muscle.",M2
18212018,"A novel mutant cardiac troponin C disrupts molecular motions critical for calcium binding affinity and cardiomyocyte contractility.Troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) belongs to the superfamily of EF-hand (helix-loop-helix) Ca(2+)-binding proteins and is an essential component of the regulatory thin filament complex. In a patient diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, we identified two novel missense mutations localized in the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding Site II of TnC, TnC((E59D,D75Y)). Expression of recombinant TnC((E59D,D75Y)) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes induced a marked decrease in contractility despite normal intracellular calcium homeostasis in intact cardiomyocytes and resulted in impaired myofilament calcium responsiveness in Triton-permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Expression of the individual mutants in cardiomyocytes showed that TnC(D75Y) was able to recapitulate the TnC((E59D,D75Y)) phenotype, whereas TnC(E59D) was functionally benign. Force-pCa relationships in TnC((E59D,D75Y)) reconstituted rabbit psoas fibers and fluorescence spectroscopy of TnC((E59D,D75Y)) labeled with 2-[(4'-iodoacetamide)-aniline]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid showed a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and Ca(2+) binding affinity, respectively. Furthermore, computational analysis of TnC showed the Ca(2+)-binding pocket as an active region of concerted motions, which are decreased markedly by mutation D75Y. We conclude that D75Y interferes with proper concerted motions within the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding pocket of TnC that hinders the relay of the thin filament calcium signal, thereby providing a primary stimulus for impaired cardiomyocyte contractility. This in turn may trigger pathways leading to aberrant ventricular remodeling and ultimately a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype.",M2
18092822,"Tryptophan mutants of cardiac troponin C: 3D structure, troponin I affinity, and in situ activity.In situ fluorescence/NMR spectroscopic approaches have been used to elucidate the structure, mobility, and domain orientations of troponin C in striated muscle. This led us to consider complementary approaches such as solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The biophysical properties of tryptophan and Trp-analogues, such as fluorotryptophan or hydroxytryptophan, are often exploited to probe protein structure and dynamics using solid-state NMR or fluorescence spectroscopy. We have characterized Phe-to-Trp mutants in the 'structural' C-domain of cardiac troponin C, designed to immobilize the indole ring in the hydrophobic core of the domain. The mutations and their fluorinated analogues (F104W, F104(5fW), F153W, and F153(5fW)) were shown not to perturb the structural properties of the protein. In this paper, we characterize the mutations F77W and F77W-V82A in the 'regulatory' N-domain of cardiac troponin C. We used NMR to determine the structure and dynamics of the mutant F77W-V82A-cNTnC, which shows a unique orientation of the indole ring. We observed a decrease in calcium binding affinity and a weaker affinity for the switch region of TnI for both mutants. We present force recovery measurements for all of the N- and C-domain mutants reconstituted into skeletal muscle fibers. The F77W mutation leads to a reduction of the in situ force recovery, whereas the C-domain mutants have the same activity as the wild type. These results suggest that the perturbations of the N-domain caused by the Trp mutation disturb the interaction between <e>TnC</e> and TnI, which in turn diminishes the activity in fibers, providing a clear example of the correlation between in vitro protein structures, their interactions, and the resulting in situ physiological activity.",M2
18087728,"Molecular characterization and immunohistochemical localization of a novel troponin C during silkworm development.We have cloned and sequenced a novel Bombyx mori gene that encodes a protein having a high degree of homology with other known troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) proteins. The amino acid sequence, DX[DN]X[DSG]X(6)E, a highly conserved putative Ca(2+) -binding motif found in loops within the globular domains of previously identified TnC proteins, is also present in BmTnC. We have expressed and purified to homogeneity a His-tagged BmTnC fusion protein having a molecular weight of approximately 21.6 kDa. We have used this purified fusion protein to produce polyclonal antibodies against BmTnC for Western blot analyses. These analyses have revealed that BmTnC is expressed in the larval head, the Malpighian tubule, the epidermis, the testis, and the gut, as has been confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction has shown that BmTnC mRNA levels differ substantially among these tissues. Our findings indicate that BmTnC is selectively expressed in the muscular tissues of the silkworm, including portions of the head, the Malpighian tubule, the body wall, and the gut.",M2
18079104,"Ca(2+) exchange with troponin C and cardiac muscle dynamics.Controversy abounds in the cardiac muscle literature over the rate-limiting steps of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. However, the idea of a single biochemical mechanism being the all-inclusive rate-limiting step for cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation may be oversimplified. There is ample evidence that Ca(2+) concentration and dynamics, intrinsic cross-bridge properties, and even troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) Ca(2+) binding and dissociation can all modulate the mechanical events of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. However, TnC has generally been thought to play no role in influencing cardiac muscle dynamics due to the idea that Ca(2+) exchange with TnC is very rapid. This definitely is the case for isolated TnC, but not for the more sophisticated biochemical systems of reconstituted thin filaments and myofibrils. This review will discuss the biochemical influences on Ca(2+) exchange with TnC and their physiological implications.",M2
18054324,"Spectroscopic and ITC study of the conformational change upon Ca2+-binding in <e>TnC</e> C-lobe and TnI peptide complex from Akazara scallop striated muscle.Akazara scallop (Chlamys nipponensis akazara) troponin C (TnC) of striated adductor muscle binds only one Ca(2+) ion at the C-terminal EF-hand motif (Site IV), but it works as the Ca(2+)-dependent regulator in adductor muscle contraction. In addition, the scallop troponin (Tn) has been thought to regulate muscle contraction via activating mechanisms that involve the region spanning from the TnC C-lobe (C-lobe) binding site to the inhibitory region of the TnI, and no alternative binding of the TnI C-terminal region to TnC because of no similarity between second TnC-binding regions of vertebrate and the scallop TnIs. To clarify the Ca(2+)-regulatory mechanism of muscle contraction by scallop Tn, we have analyzed the Ca(2+)-binding properties of the complex of TnC C-lobe and TnI peptide, and their interaction using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and gel filtration chromatography. The results showed that single Ca(2+)-binding to the Site IV leads to a structural transition not only in Site IV but also Site III through the structural network in the C-lobe of scallop TnC. We therefore assumed that the effect of Ca(2+)-binding must lead to a change in the interaction mode between the C-lobe of TnC and the TnI peptide. The change should be the first event of the transmission of Ca(2+) signal to TnI in Tn ternary complex.",M2
17940202,"Functional and evolutionary relationships of troponin C.Striated muscle contraction is initiated when, following membrane depolarization, Ca(2+) binds to the low-affinity Ca(2+) binding sites of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). The Ca(2+) activation of this protein results in a rearrangement of the components (troponin I, troponin T, and tropomyosin) of the thin filament, resulting in increased interaction between actin and myosin and the formation of cross bridges. The functional properties of this protein are therefore critical in determining the active properties of striated muscle. To date there are 61 known TnCs that have been cloned from 41 vertebrate and invertebrate species. In vertebrate species there are also distinct fast skeletal muscle and cardiac TnC proteins. While there is relatively high conservation of the amino acid sequence of TnC homologs between species and tissue types, there is wide variation in the functional properties of these proteins. To date there has been extensive study of the structure and function of this protein and how differences in these translate into the functional properties of muscles. The purpose of this work is to integrate these studies of TnC with phylogenetic analysis to investigate how changes in the sequence and function of this protein, integrate with the evolution of striated muscle.",M2
17928540,"The origin of passive force enhancement in skeletal muscle.The aim of the present study was to test whether titin is a calcium-dependent spring and whether it is the source of the passive force enhancement observed in muscle and single fiber preparations. We measured passive force enhancement in troponin C (<e>TnC</e>)-depleted myofibrils in which active force production was completely eliminated. The TnC-depleted construct allowed for the investigation of the effect of calcium concentration on passive force, without the confounding effects of actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and active force production. Passive forces in TnC-depleted myofibrils (n = 6) were 35.0 +/- 2.9 nN/ microm(2) when stretched to an average sarcomere length of 3.4 microm in a solution with low calcium concentration (pCa 8.0). Passive forces in the same myofibrils increased by 25% to 30% when stretches were performed in a solution with high calcium concentration (pCa 3.5). Since it is well accepted that titin is the primary source for passive force in rabbit psoas myofibrils and since the increase in passive force in TnC-depleted myofibrils was abolished after trypsin treatment, our results suggest that increasing calcium concentration is associated with increased titin stiffness. However, this calcium-induced titin stiffness accounted for only approximately 25% of the passive force enhancement observed in intact myofibrils. Therefore, approximately 75% of the normally occurring passive force enhancement remains unexplained. The findings of the present study suggest that passive force enhancement is partly caused by a calcium-induced increase in titin stiffness but also requires cross-bridge formation and/or active force production for full manifestation.",M2
17868693,"The regulation of myosin binding to actin filaments by Lethocerus troponin.Lethocerus indirect flight muscle has two isoforms of troponin C, <e>TnC</e>-F1 and F2, which are unusual in having only a single C-terminal calcium binding site (site IV, isoform F1) or one C-terminal and one N-terminal site (sites IV and II, isoform F2). We show here that thin filaments assembled from rabbit actin and Lethocerus tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) regulate the binding of rabbit myosin to rabbit actin in much the same way as the mammalian regulatory proteins. The removal of calcium reduces the rate constant for S1 binding to regulated actin about threefold, independent of which TmTn is used. This is consistent with calcium removal causing the TmTn to occupy the B or blocked state to about 70% of the total. The mid point pCa for the switch differed for TnC-F1 and F2 (pCa 6.9 and 6.0, respectively) consistent with the reported calcium affinities for the two TnCs. Equilibrium titration of S1 binding to regulated actin filaments confirms calcium regulated binding of S1 to actin and shows that in the absence of calcium the three actin filaments (TnC-F1, TnC-F2 and mammalian control) are almost indistinguishable in terms of occupancy of the B and C states of the filament. In the presence of calcium TnC-F2 is very similar to the control with approximately 80% of the filament in the C-state and 10-15% in the fully on M-State while TnC-F1 has almost 50% in each of the C and M states. This higher occupancy of the M-state for TnC-F1, which occurs above pCa 6.9, is consistent with this isoform being involved in the calcium activation of stretch activation. However, it leaves unanswered how a C-terminal calcium binding site of TnC can activate the thin filament.",M2
17761138,"Microtiter plate monoclonal antibody epitope analysis of Ca2+- and Mg2+-induced conformational changes in troponin C.Spectroscopic methods such as circular dichroism and Förster resonance energy transfer are current approaches for monitoring protein conformational changes. Those analyses require special equipment and expertise. The need for fluorescence labeling of the protein may interfere with the native structure. We have developed a microtiter plate-based monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitope analysis to detect protein conformational changes in a high throughput manner. This method is based on the concept that the affinity of the antigen-binding site of an antibody for the specific antigenic epitope will change when the 3-D structure of the epitope changes. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated in the present study on troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), an allosteric protein in the Ca(2+) regulatory system of striated muscle. Using TnC purified by a highly effective rapid procedure and mAbs developed against epitopes in the N- and C-domains of TnC enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) clearly detected Ca(2+)-induced conformational changes in both the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal structural domain of TnC. On the other hand, Mg(2+)-binding to the C-domain of TnC resulted in a long-range effect on the N-domain conformation, indicating a functional significance of Ca(2+)-Mg(2+) exchange at the C-domain metal ion-binding sites. In addition to further understanding of the structure-function relationship of TnC, the data demonstrate that the mAb epitope analysis provides a simple high throughput method for monitoring 3-D structural changes in native proteins under physiological condition and has broad applications in protein structure-function relationship studies.",M2
17693547,"Modulation of the rate of cardiac muscle contraction by troponin C constructs with various calcium binding affinities.We investigated whether changing thin filament Ca(2+) sensitivity alters the rate of contraction, either during normal cross-bridge cycling or when cross-bridge cycling is increased by inorganic phosphate (P(i)). We increased or decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force production by incorporating into rat skinned cardiac trabeculae the troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) mutants V44QTnC(F27W) and F20QTnC(F27W). The rate of isometric contraction was assessed as the rate of force redevelopment (k(tr)) after a rapid release and restretch to the original length of the muscle. Both in the absence of added P(i) and in the presence of 2.5 mM added P(i) 1) Ca(2+) sensitivity of k(tr) was increased by V44QTnC(F27W) and decreased by F20QTnC(F27W) compared with control TnC(F27W); 2) k(tr) at submaximal Ca(2+) activation was significantly faster for V44QTnC(F27W) and slower for F20QTnC(F27W) compared with control TnC(F27W); 3) at maximum Ca(2+) activation, k(tr) values were similar for control TnC(F27W), V44QTnC(F27W), and F20QTnC(F27W); and 4) k(tr) exhibited a linear dependence on force that was indistinguishable for all TnCs. In the presence of 2.5 mM P(i), k(tr) was faster at all pCa values compared with the values for no added P(i) for TnC(F27W), V44QTnC(F27W), and F20QTnC(F27W). This study suggests that TnC Ca(2+) binding properties modulate the rate of cardiac muscle contraction at submaximal levels of Ca(2+) activation. This result has physiological relevance considering that, on a beat-to-beat basis, the heart contracts at submaximal Ca(2+) activation.",M2
17637342,"The structure of Lethocerus troponin C: insights into the mechanism of stretch activation in muscles.To gain a molecular description of how muscles can be activated by mechanical stretch, we have solved the structure of the calcium-loaded F1 isoform of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) from Lethocerus and characterized its interactions with troponin I (TnI). We show that the presence of only one calcium cation in the fourth EF hand motif is sufficient to induce an open conformation in the C-terminal lobe of F1 TnC, in contrast with what is observed in vertebrate muscle. This lobe interacts in a calcium-independent way both with the N terminus of TnI and, with lower affinity, with a region of TnI equivalent to the switch and inhibitory peptides of vertebrate muscles. Using both synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins, we show that the N lobe of F1 TnC is not engaged in interactions with TnI, excluding a regulatory role of this domain. These findings provide insights into mechanically stimulated muscle contraction.",M2

TnC of the invertebrate Akazara scallop can bind only one Ca(2+) at the C-terminal EF-hand motif. Recombinant TnC was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, complexed with a 24-residue synthetic peptide derived from scallop troponin I (TnI) and crystallized. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 1.80 A resolution and belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 32.1, b = 42.2, c = 60.0 A.

17350907,"Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of the proximity changes between the central helix of troponin C and the C-terminus of troponin T from chicken skeletal muscle.Recent structural studies of the troponin (Tn) core complex have shown that the regulatory head containing the N-lobe of <e>TnC</e> is connected to the IT arm by a flexible linker of TnC. The IT arm is a long coiled-coil formed by alpha-helices of TnI and TnT, plus the C-lobe of TnC. The TnT is thought to play a pivotal role in the linking of Ca(2+) -triggered conformational changes in thin filament regulatory proteins to the activation of cross-bridge cycling. However, a functional domain at the C-terminus of TnT is missing from the Tn core complex. In this study, we intended to determine the proximity relationship between the central helix of TnC and the TnT C-terminus in the binary and the ternary complex with and without Ca2+ by using pyrene excimer fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Chicken fast skeletal TnC contains a Cys102 at the E helix, while TnT has a Cys264 at its C-terminus. These two cysteines were specifically labeled with sulfhydryl-reactive fluorescence probes. The measured distance in the binary complex was about 19 Angstroms and slightly increased when they formed the ternary complex with TnI (20 Angstroms). Upon Ca2+ binding the distance was not affected in the binary complex but increased by approximately 4 Angstroms in the ternary complex. These results suggest that TnI plays an essential role in the Ca(2+) -mediated change in the spatial relationship between the C-lobe of TnC and the C-terminus of TnT.",M2
17303066,"Removing the regulatory N-terminal domain of cardiac troponin I diminishes incompatibility during bacterial expression.Troponin I (TnI) is a muscle-specific protein and plays an allosteric function in the Ca(2+) regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Expression of cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli is an essential approach to preparing human TnI and mutants for structural and functional studies. The expression level of cardiac TnI in E. coli is very low. To reduce the potential toxicity of cardiac TnI to the host cell, we constructed a bi-cistronic expression vector to co-express cardiac TnI and cardiac/slow troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), a natural binding partner of TnI and a protein that readily expresses in E. coli at high levels. The co-expression moderately increased the expression of cardiac TnI although a high amount of TnC protein was produced from the bi-cistronic mRNA. The use of an E. coli strain containing additional tRNAs for certain low bacterial usage eukaryotic codons improved the expression of cardiac TnI. Modifications of two 5'-regional codons that have predicted low usages in bacterial cells did not reproduce the improvement, indicating that not the 5' but the overall codon usage restricts the translational efficiency of cardiac TnI mRNA in E. coli. However, deletion of the cardiac TnI-specific N-terminal 28 amino acids significantly improved the protein expression independent of the host cell tRNA modifications. The results suggest that the regulatory N-terminal domain of cardiac TnI is a dominant factor for the incompatibility in bacterial cells, supporting its role in modulating the overall molecular conformation.",M2
17278361,"Calcium structural transition of troponin in the complexes, on the thin filament, and in muscle fibres, as studied by site-directed spin-labelling EPR.We have measured the intersite distance, side-chain mobility and orientation of specific site(s) of troponin (Tn) complex on the thin filaments or in muscle fibres as well as in solution by means of site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR). We have examined the Ca(2+)-induced movement of the B and C helices relative to the D helix in a human cardiac (hc)<e>TnC</e> monomer state and hcTnC-hcTnI binary complex. An interspin distance between G42C (B helix) and C84 (D helix) was 18.4 angstroms in the absence of Ca2+. The distance between Q58C (C helix) and C84 (D helix) was 18.3 angstroms. Distance changes were observed by the addition of Ca2+ and by the formation of a complex with TnI. Both Ca2+ and TnI are essential for the full opening -3 angstroms of the N-domain in cardiac TnC. We have determined the in situ distances between C35 and C84 by measuring pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy. The distances were 26.0 and 27.2 A in the monomer state and in reconstituted fibres, respectively. The addition of Ca2+ decreased the distance to 23.2 angstroms in fibres but only slightly in the monomer state, indicating that Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe of hcTnC induced a larger structural change in muscle fibres than in the monomer state. We also succeeded in synthesizing a new bifunctional spin labels that is firmly fixed on a central E-helix (94C-101C) of skeletal(sk)TnC to examine its orientation in reconstituted muscle fibres. EPR spectrum showed that this helix is disordered with respect to the filament axis. We have studied the calcium structural transition in skTnI and tropomyosin on the filament by SDSL-EPR. The spin label at a TnI switch segment (C133) showed three motional states depending on Ca2+ and actin. The data suggested that the TnI switch segment binds to TnC N-lobe in +Ca2+ state, and that in -Ca2+ state it is free in TnC-I-T complex alone while fixed to actin in the reconstituted thin filaments. In contrast, the side chain spin labels along the entire tropomyosin molecule showed no Ca(2+)-induced mobility changes.",M2

17254604,"Orientational information of troponin C within the thin filaments obtained by neutron fiber diffraction.In striated muscles contraction is regulated by the thin filament-based proteins, troponin consisting of three subunits (<e>TnC</e>, TnI, and TnT), and tropomyosin. Knowledge of in situ structures of these proteins is indispensable for elucidating this Ca(2+)-sensitive regulatory mechanism. We employed neutron scattering to investigate the structure of TnC within the thin filament, and found that TnC assumes extended dumbbell-like structures and moves toward the filament axis by binding of Ca(2+). Here, in order to obtain more detailed in situ structural information of TnC, neutron fiber diffraction measurements were performed. Sols of native thin filaments and the thin filaments containing deuterated TnC were prepared in (2)H(2)O. The oriented samples were obtained by placing these sols sealed in quartz capillaries with a diameter of 3 mm in a magnetic field of 18 Tesla. Neutron fiber diffraction patterns were obtained from these oriented samples in the absence and presence of Ca(2+). The patterns obtained showed strong equatorial diffraction due to the thin filaments, 59 A and 51 A layer-lines due to actin, and meridional reflections due to Tn-complex. Analysis of the meridional reflections due to Tn-complex with aid of model calculation showed that the angle between the thin filament axis and the long axis of TnC was estimated to be 67(+/-7) degrees and 49(+/-17) degrees , in the absence and presence of Ca(2+), respectively, suggesting that TnC, which assumes orientations rather perpendicular to the filament axis in the absence of Ca(2+), tilts toward the filament axis and the orientational and positional disorder increases by binding Ca(2+). It also showed that the relative position of the TnC moved by about 22 A by binding Ca(2+), and this apparent movement was concomitant with the movements of other Tn-subunits. This implies that by binding Ca(2+), significant structural rearrangements of Tn-subunits occur.",M2
17204497,"Thin-filament regulation of force redevelopment kinetics in rabbit skeletal muscle fibres.Thin-filament regulation of isometric force redevelopment (k(tr)) was examined in rabbit psoas fibres by substituting native <e>TnC</e> with either cardiac TnC (cTnC), a site I-inactive skeletal TnC mutant (xsTnC), or mixtures of native purified skeletal TnC (sTnC) and a site I- and II-inactive skeletal TnC mutant (xxsTnC). Reconstituted maximal Ca(2+)-activated force (rF(max)) decreased as the fraction of sTnC in sTnC: xxsTnC mixtures was reduced, but maximal k(tr) was unaffected until rF(max) was &lt;0.2 of pre-extracted F(max). In contrast, reconstitution with cTnC or xsTnC reduced maximal k(tr) to 0.48 and 0.44 of control (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, with corresponding rF(max) of 0.68 +/- 0.03 and 0.25 +/- 0.02 F(max). The k(tr)-pCa relation of fibres containing sTnC: xxsTnC mixtures (rF(max) &gt; 0.2 F(max)) was little effected, though k(tr) was slightly elevated at low Ca(2+) activation. The magnitude of the Ca(2+)-dependent increase in k(tr) was greatly reduced following cTnC or xsTnC reconstitution because k(tr) at low levels of Ca(2+) was elevated and maximal k(tr) was reduced. Solution Ca(2+) dissociation rates (k(off)) from whole Tn complexes containing sTnC (26 +/- 0.1 s(-1)), cTnC (38 +/- 0.9 s(-1)) and xsTnC (50 +/- 1.2 s(-1)) correlated with k(tr) at low Ca(2+) levels and were inversely related to rF(max). At low Ca(2+) activation, k(tr) was similarly elevated in cTnC-reconstituted fibres with ATP or when cross-bridge cycling rate was increased with 2-deoxy-ATP. Our results and model simulations indicate little or no requirement for cooperative interactions between thin-filament regulatory units in modulating k(tr) at any [Ca(2+)] and suggest Ca(2+) activation properties of individual troponin complexes may influence the apparent rate constant of cross-bridge detachment.",M2
17056730,"Cooperative effects of rigor and cycling cross-bridges on calcium binding to troponin C.The effects of rigor and cycling cross-bridges on distributions of calcium (Ca) bound within sarcomeres of rabbit psoas muscle fibers were compared using electron probe x-ray microanalysis. Calcium in the overlap region of rigor fibers, after correction for that bound to thick filaments, was significantly higher than in the I-band at all pCa levels tested between 6.9 and 4.8, but the difference was greatest at pCa 6.9. With addition of MgATP, differences were significant at high levels of activation (pCa 5.6 and 4.9); near and below the threshold for activation, Ca was the same in I-band and overlap regions. Comparison of Ca and mass profiles at the A-I junction showed elevation of Ca extending 55-110 nm (up to three regulatory units) into the I-band. Extraction of <e>TnC</e>-reduced I-band and overlap Ca in rigor fibers at pCa 5.6 to the same levels found in unextracted fibers at pCa 8.9, suggesting that variations reported here reflect changes in Ca bound to troponin C (TnC).

17021793,"Functional effects of the DCM mutant Gly159Asp troponin C in skinned muscle fibres.We recently reported a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) causing mutation in a novel disease gene, TNNC1, which encodes cardiac troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). We have determined how this mutation, Gly159Asp, affects contractile regulation when incorporated into muscle fibres. Endogenous troponin in rabbit skinned psoas fibres was partially replaced by recombinant human cardiac troponin containing either wild-type or Gly159Asp TnC. We measured both the force-pCa relationship of these fibres and the activation rate using the caged-Ca(2+) compound nitrophenyl-EGTA. Gly159Asp TnC had no significant effect on either the Ca(2+) sensitivity or cooperativity of force generation when compared to wild type. However, the mutation caused a highly significant (ca. 50%) decrease in the rate of activation. This study shows that whilst not affecting the force-pCa relationship, the mutation Gly159Asp causes a significant decrease in the rate of force production and a change in the relationship between the rate of force production and generated force. In vivo, this mutation may cause both a slowing of force generation and reduction in total systolic force. This represents a novel mechanism by which a cardiomyopathy-causing mutation can affect contractility.",M2
16857772,"Development and cardiac contractility: cardiac troponin T isoforms and cytosolic calcium in rabbit.Cardiac contractility depends on calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments and cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) during activation. During development, the cardiac troponin T isoform cTnT(1) is replaced by shorter cTnT isoforms, including cTnT(4), and changes occur in other myofibrillar proteins and in calcium regulation. We expressed rabbit recombinant (r)cTnT(1) and rcTnT(4) in Spodoptera frugiperda cells and determined their effect on calcium binding to <e>TnC</e> in solution and on the calcium sensitivity of myofilaments in skinned rabbit ventricular fibers in vitro. We measured [Ca(2+)](i) and L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) in ventricular myocytes from 3-wk-old and adult rabbits. The dissociation constant (K(d)) of Ca-Tn(cTnT1) in solution was smaller than that of Ca-Tn(cTnT4) (mean +/- SE: 0.52 +/- 0.08 mumol/L versus 0.83 +/- 0.09 mumol/L). The Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development was greater in fibers reconstituted with rcTnT(1) (pCa(50) 6.07 +/- 0.04) than those reconstituted with rcTnT(4) (pCa(50) 5.75 +/- 0.07). Systolic [Ca](i) was lower in 3-wk-old than adult cells (443 +/- 35 nmol/L versus 882 +/- 88 nmol/L) as was I(Ca) (5.8 +/- 0.9 pA/pF versus 14.2 +/- 1.6 pA/pF). The higher calcium sensitivity of Tn-Ca binding and of force development conferred by rcTnT(1) suggest that higher neonatal cTnT(1) expression may partially compensate for the lower systolic [Ca(2+)](i).",M2
16857209,"Myofibrillar troponin exists in three states and there is signal transduction along skeletal myofibrillar thin filaments.Activation of striated muscle contraction is a highly cooperative signal transduction process converting calcium binding by troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) into interactions between thin and thick filaments. Once calcium is bound, transduction involves changes in protein interactions along the thin filament. The process is thought to involve three different states of actin-tropomyosin (Tm) resulting from changes in troponin's (Tn) interaction with actin-Tm: a blocked (B) state preventing myosin interaction, a closed (C) state allowing weak myosin interactions and favored by calcium binding to Tn, and an open or M state allowing strong myosin interactions. This was tested by measuring the apparent rate of Tn dissociation from rigor skeletal myofibrils using labeled Tn exchange. The location and rate of exchange of Tn or its subunits were measured by high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Three different rates of Tn exchange were observed that were dependent on calcium concentration and strong cross-bridge binding that strongly support the three-state model. The rate of Tn dissociation in the non-overlap region was 200-fold faster at pCa 4 (C-state region) than at pCa 9 (B-state region). When Tn contained engineered TnC mutants with weakened regulatory TnI interactions, the apparent exchange rate at pCa 4 in the non-overlap region increased proportionately with TnI-TnC regulatory affinity. This suggests that the mechanism of calcium enhancement of the rate of Tn dissociation is by favoring a TnI-TnC interaction over a TnI-actin-Tm interaction. At pCa 9, the rate of Tn dissociation in the overlap region (M-state region) was 100-fold faster than the non-overlap region (B-state region) suggesting that strong cross-bridges increase the rate of Tn dissociation. At pCa 4, the rate of Tn dissociation was twofold faster in the non-overlap region (C-state region) than the overlap region (M-state region) that likely involved a strong cross-bridge influence on TnT's interaction with actin-Tm. At sub-maximal calcium (pCa 6.2-5.8), there was a long-range influence of the strong cross-bridge on Tn to enhance its dissociation rate, tens of nanometers from the strong cross-bridge. These observations suggest that the three different states of actin-Tm are associated with three different states of Tn. They also support a model in which strong cross-bridges shift the regulatory equilibrium from a TnI-actin-Tm interaction to a TnC-TnI interaction that likely enhances calcium binding by TnC.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: The aequorin method was used with intact ferret papillary muscles and a tetanic contraction was induced by a repetitive electrical stimulation in the presence of ryanodine. The extra-Ca2+, the transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to a rapid reduction in muscle length, which reflects the change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC because of cross-bridge detachment, was measured, and the cross-bridge-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC was estimated by observing the change in the slope of the extra-Ca2+ -tension relation. The extra-Ca2+ -tension relation measured during relaxation became steeper than that during contraction in all cases. The extra-Ca2+ -tension relation became steeper in the presence of 20 mmol/L caffeine during contraction in all cases. CONCLUSION: During relaxation, the downstream-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC was enhanced, compared with that during contraction, because of a decrease in the number of attached cross-bridges.",M2
16764818,"Regulation of contraction kinetics in skinned skeletal muscle fibers by calcium and troponin C.The influences of [Ca(2+)] and Ca(2+) dissociation rate from troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) on the kinetics of contraction (k(Ca)) activated by photolysis of a caged Ca(2+) compound in skinned fast-twitch psoas and slow-twitch soleus fibers from rabbits were investigated at 15 degrees C. Increasing the amount of Ca(2+) released increased the amount of force in psoas and soleus fibers and increased k(Ca) in a curvilinear manner in psoas fibers approximately 5-fold but did not alter k(Ca) in soleus fibers. Reconstituting psoas fibers with mutants of TnC that in solution exhibited increased Ca(2+) affinity and approximately 2- to 5-fold decreased Ca(2+) dissociation rate (M82Q TnC) or decreased Ca(2+) affinity and approximately 2-fold increased Ca(2+) dissociation rate (NHdel TnC) did not affect maximal k(Ca). Thus the influence of [Ca(2+)] on k(Ca) is fiber type dependent and the maximum k(Ca) in psoas fibers is dominated by kinetics of cross-bridge cycling over kinetics of Ca(2+) exchange with TnC.",M2
16674185,"Bioenzymatic detection of troponin C using micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems.Diagnosis and monitoring of critical diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) require a quantitative analysis of biological molecules. A high-throughput identification of these biological molecules can be generated by using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) structures like simple cantilever beams, which respond to the intermolecular forces resulting from binding these molecules. Biochemical markers like troponin C are considered the primary markers for myocardial injury and have generated considerable interest. A 26-residue lytic membrane protein of bee venom melittin (ME) is chosen to interact with rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) on the surface of the cantilever beams. An optical beam deflection method is employed to identify the enzymatic reaction on the surface of the cantilever due to these proteins. Identification of these proteins is also done using fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) to compliment the optical monitored deflection method. A second set of proteins like horse radish peroxide (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are applied to atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever beams to study their behavior under the enzymatic reactions of proteins. Identification of these proteins is done using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). An analytical model of the cantilever beam is developed, and its mode shapes are studied by employing orthogonal polynomials in the classic Rayleigh-Ritz method. The surface stress caused by the enzymatic reaction of the proteins that leads to pure bending on the top surface of the cantilever is evaluated. The information provided by the experimental and analytical modeling reported in this work will be useful in the development of a portable biosensor for the detection of AMI.",M2
16475158,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study on the Ca2+ -bound coordination structures of synthetic peptide analogues of the calcium-binding site III of troponin C.The coordination structures of Ca(2+) ion bound to synthetic peptide analogues of the calcium-binding site III of rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The region of the COO(-) antisymmetric stretching vibration provides information about the coordination modes of a COO(-) group to a metal ion. The 34-residue peptide corresponding to the EF hand motif (helix-loop-helix) showed a band at 1552 cm(-1) in the Ca(2+)-loaded state, indicating that the side-chain COO(-) group of Glu at the 12th position serves as a ligand for Ca(2+) in the bidentate coordination mode. On the other hand, the 13-residue peptide (Ac-DRDADGYIDAEEL-NH(2)) containing the Ca(2+)-binding site III (DRDADGYIDAEE) did not show such spectral patterns in the Ca(2+)-loaded state, meaning that shorter synthetic peptide corresponding to the site III has less or no affinity for Ca(2+). It was found that the 17-residue peptide (Ac-DRDADGYIDAEELAEIF-NH(2)) is the minimum peptide necessary for the interaction of side-chain COO(-)of Glu at the 12th position with Ca(2+) in the bidentate coordination mode. We discuss the relationship between the amino acid length of synthetic peptide analogues and the formation of Ca(2+)-bound coordination structure.",M2
16415057,"Dynamics of the C-terminal region of TnI in the troponin complex in solution.The determination of crystal structures of the troponin complex (Takeda et al. 2003. Nature. 424:35-41; Vinogradova et al. 2005. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 102:5038-5043) has advanced knowledge of the regulation of muscle contraction at the molecular level. However, there are domains important for actin binding that are not visualized. We present evidence that the C-terminal region of troponin I (TnI residues 135-182) is flexible in solution and has no stable secondary structure. We use NMR spectroscopy to observe the backbone dynamics of skeletal [2H, 13C, 15N]-TnI in the troponin complex in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA/Mg2+. Residues in this region give stronger signals than the remainder of TnI, and chemical shift index values indicate little secondary structure, suggesting a very flexible region. This is confirmed by NMR relaxation measurements. Unlike <e>TnC</e> and other regions of TnI in the complex, the C-terminal region of TnI is not affected by Ca2+ binding. Relaxation measurements and reduced spectral density analysis are consistent with the C-terminal region of TnI being a tethered domain connected to the rest of the troponin complex by a flexible linker, residues 137-146, followed by a collapsed region with at most nascent secondary structure.",M2
16375855,"Calcium-dependent movement of troponin I between troponin C and actin as revealed by spin-labeling EPR.We measured EPR spectra from a spin label on the Cys133 residue of troponin I (TnI) to identify Ca(2+)-induced structural states, based on sensitivity of spin-label mobility to flexibility and tertiary contact of a polypeptide. Spectrum from Tn complexes in the -Ca(2+) state showed that Cys133 was located at a flexible polypeptide segment (rotational correlation time tau=1.9ns) that was free from <e>TnC</e>. Spectra of both Tn complexes alone and those reconstituted into the thin filaments in the +Ca(2+) state showed that Cys133 existed on a stable segment (tau=4.8ns) held by TnC. Spectra of reconstituted thin filaments (-Ca(2+) state) revealed that slow mobility (tau=45ns) was due to tertiary contact of Cys133 with actin, because the same slow mobility was found for TnI-actin and TnI-tropomyosin-actin filaments lacking TnC, T or tropomyosin. We propose that the Cys133 region dissociates from TnC and attaches to the actin surface on the thin filaments, causing muscle relaxation at low Ca(2+) concentrations.",M2
16339881,"A quantitative analysis of cardiac myocyte relaxation: a simulation study.The determinants of relaxation in cardiac muscle are poorly understood, yet compromised relaxation accompanies various pathologies and impaired pump function. In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca2+]i transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca2+ from troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+ sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.",M2
16322912,"Transient expression of fast troponin C transcripts in embryonic quail heart.Most myofibrillar proteins, including troponin I and troponin T subunits of troponin complex, undergo developmental stage-specific isoform transitions in vertebrate heart before attaining adult contractile and regulatory characteristics. Only the cardiac/slow skeletal muscle type isoform of troponin C, however, has been shown to be expressed in both adult and developing heart. The changes in troponin C could be functionally important as the <e>TnC</e> isoforms vary in their affinities for Ca(2+). For example, fast troponin C has two Ca(2+) binding sites while slow/cardiac troponin C has a single regulatory site. This study demonstrates the co-expression of both fast and slow transcripts of troponin C in not only quail embryonic skeletal muscle but also embryonic heart using two different analytical techniques of polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation procedure. Fast troponin C expression in the quail heart using in situ hybridisation procedure was first observed at embryonic day 3, with maximum expression at day 5 after which its level in the developing heart was gradually down regulated. In situ hybridisation staining of sections at these developmental stages demonstrated the expression of both fast and slow transcripts of troponin C in all cardiomyocytes.",M2
16300900,"Ionic interventions that alter the association of troponin C C-domain with the thin filaments of vertebrate striated muscle.The regulatory complex of vertebrate skeletal muscle integrates information about cross-bridge binding, divalent cations and other intracellular ionic conditions to control activation of muscle contraction. Relatively little is known about the role of the troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) C-domain in the absence of Ca2+. Here, we use a standardized condition for measuring isometric tension in rabbit psoas skinned fibers to track TnC attachment and detachment in the absence of Ca2+ under different conditions of ionic strength, pH and MgATP. In the presence of MgATP and Mg2+, TnC detaches more readily and has a 1.5- to 2-fold lower affinity for the intact thin filament at pH 8 and 250 mM K+ than at pH 6 or in 30 mM K+; changes in affinity are fully reversible. The response to ionic strength is lost when Mg2+ and MgATP are absent, whereas the response to pH persists, suggesting that weaker electrostatic TnC-TnI-TnT interactions can be overridden by strongly bound cross-bridges. In solution, titration of a fluorescent C-domain mutant (F154W TnC) with Mg2+ reveals no significant changes in Mg2+ affinity with pH or ionic strength, suggesting that these parameters influence TnC binding by acting directly on electrostatic forces between TnC and TnI rather than by changing Mg2+ binding to C-domain sites III and IV.",M2
16258047,"Kinetics of cardiac thin-filament activation probed by fluorescence polarization of rhodamine-labeled troponin C in skinned guinea pig trabeculae.A genetically engineered cardiac <e>TnC</e> mutant labeled at Cys-84 with tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide was passively exchanged for the endogenous form in skinned guinea pig trabeculae. The extent of exchange averaged nearly 70%, quantified by protein microarray of individual trabeculae. The uniformity of its distribution was verified by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence polarization, giving probe angle and its dispersion relative to the fiber long axis, was monitored simultaneously with isometric tension. Probe angle reflects underlying cTnC orientation. In steady-state experiments, rigor cross-bridges and Ca2+ with vanadate to inhibit cross-bridge formation produce a similar change in probe orientation as that observed with cycling cross-bridges (no Vi). Changes in probe angle were found at [Ca2+] well below those required to generate tension. Cross-bridges increased the Ca2+ dependence of angle change (cooperativity). Strong cross-bridge formation enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity and was required for full change in probe position. At submaximal [Ca2+], the thin filament regulatory system may act in a coordinated fashion, with the probe orientation of Ca2+-bound cTnC significantly affected by Ca2+ binding at neighboring regulatory units. The time course of the probe angle change and tension after photolytic release [Ca2+] by laser photolysis of NP-EGTA was Ca2+ sensitive and biphasic: a rapid component approximately 10 times faster than that of tension and a slower rate similar to that of tension. The fast component likely represents steps closely associated with Ca2+ binding to site II of cTnC, whereas the slow component may arise from cross-bridge feedback. These results suggest that the thin filament activation rate does not limit the tension time course in cardiac muscle.",M2
16213185,"Troponin C/calmodulin chimeras as erythrocyte plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activators.Calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) are EF-hand proteins that play fundamentally different roles in animal physiology. TnC has a very low affinity for the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and is a poor substitute for CaM in increasing the enzyme's affinity for Ca2+ and the rate of ATP hydrolysis. We use a series of recombinant TnC (rTnC)/CaM chimeras to clarify the importance of the CaM carboxyl-terminal domain in the activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase. The rTnC/CaM chimera, in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of TnC is replaced by that of CaM, has the same ability as CaM to bind and transmit the signal to Ca2+ sites on the enzyme. There is no further functional gain when the amino-terminal domain is modified to make the rTnC/CaM chimera more CaM-like. To identify which regions of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CaM are responsible for these effects, we constructed the chimeras rTnC/3CaM and rTnC/4CaM, where only one-half of the C-terminal domain of CaM (residues 85-112 or residues 113-148) replaces the corresponding region in rTnC. Neither rTnC/3CaM nor rTnC/4CaM can mimic CaM in its affinity for the enzyme. Nevertheless, with respect to the signal transduction process, rTnC/4CaM, but not rTnC/3CaM, shows the same behaviour as CaM. We conclude that the whole C-terminal domain is required for binding to the enzyme while Ca2+-binding site 4 of CaM bears all the requirements to increase Ca2+ binding at PMCA sites. Such mechanism of binding and activation is distinct from that proposed for most other CaM targets. Furthermore, we suggest that Ala128 and Met124 from CaM site 4 may play a crucial role in discriminating CaM from TnC.",M2
16183325,"Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) binding to weak sites of <e>TnC</e> C-domain induces exposure of a large hydrophobic surface that leads to loss of TnC from the thin filament.The C-domain of troponin C, the Ca(2+)-binding subunit of the troponin complex, has two high-affinity sites for Ca(2+) that also bind Mg(2+) (Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) sites), whereas the N-domain has two low-affinity sites for Ca(2+). Two more sites that bind Mg(2+) with very low affinity (K(a)&lt;10(3)M(-1)) have been detected by several laboratories but have not been localized or studied in any detail. Here we investigated the effects of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) binding to isolated C-domain, focusing primarily on low-affinity sites. Since TnC has no Trp residues, we utilized a mutant with Phe 154 replaced by Trp (F154W/C-domain). As expected from previous reports, the changes in Trp fluorescence revealed different conformations induced by the addition of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) (Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) sites). Exposure of hydrophobic surfaces of F154W/C-domain was monitored using the fluorescence intensity of bis-anilino naphthalene sulfonic acid. Unlike the changes reported by Trp, the increments in bis-ANS fluorescence were much greater (4.2-fold) when Ca(2+)+Mg(2+) were both present or when Ca(2+) was present at high concentration. Bis-ANS fluorescence increased as a function of [Ca(2+)] in two well-defined steps: one at low [Ca(2+)], consistent with the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) sites (K(a) approximately 1.5 x 10(6)M(-1)), and one of much lower affinity (K(a) approximately 52.3M(-1)). Controls were performed to rule out artifacts due to aggregation, high ionic strength and formation of the bis-ANS-TnC complex itself. With a low concentration of Ca(2+) (0.6mM) to occupy the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) sites, a large increase in bis-ANS binding also occurred as Mg(2+) occupied a class of low-affinity sites (K(a) approximately 59 M(-1)). In skinned fibers, a high concentration of Mg(2+) (10-44 mM) caused TnC to dissociate from the thin filament. These data provide new evidence for a class of weak binding sites for divalent cations. They are located in the C-domain, lead to exposure of a large hydrophobic surface, and destabilize the binding of TnC to the regulatory complex even when sites III and IV are occupied.",M2
16176967,"Electrophoretic and functional identification of two troponin C isoforms in toad skeletal muscle fibers.The differential sensitivity of frog twitch and slow-tonic fibers to Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) suggests that these two fiber types express different troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) isoforms. To date, only one TnC isoform from anurans (resembling the mammalian fast-twitch isoform) has been isolated and characterized. In this study, we examined the possibility that anuran striated muscle contains more than one TnC isoform. Toward this end, we determined the TnC isoform composition of 198 single fibers from the rectus abdominis of the cane toad (a mixed slow-tonic and twitch muscle) and of toad cardiac muscle using a method that enables the identification of TnC isoforms on the basis of the effect of Ca(2+) on their electrophoretic mobility. The fibers were typed according to their myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform composition. The data indicate that striated muscle of the cane toad contains two TnC isoforms, one of which (TnC-t) is present in all fibers displaying only twitch MHC isoforms and the other of which (TnC-T/c) is present in fibers displaying the tonic MHC isoform and in cardiac muscle. For a subpopulation of 15 fibers, the TnC isoform composition was also compared with Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) activation characteristics. Fibers containing the TnC-T/c isoform were approximately 3-fold more sensitive to Ca(2+), approximately 40-fold more sensitive to Sr(2+), and responded to a approximately 4.6-fold broader range of [Ca(2+)] than did fibers containing the TnC-t isoform. The Ca(2+) activation properties of toad fibers containing the TnC-T/c isoform appear to be consistent with the previously reported physiological characteristics of amphibian slow-tonic muscle fibers.",M2
16157641,"Dynamic structures of motor proteins myosin and kinesin, and switch protein troponin as detected by SDSL-ESR.We have studied biological nano-machines, motor and switch proteins operating as supramolecular complexes by electron spin resonance (ESR) and found key features of their molecular movements. In all the systems, the specific movements of elements or domains were detected and quite dynamic at nanometer scale. We have observed two broad but distinct orientations, separated by a 25 degrees axial rotation, of a spin label attached specifically to the light chain (LC) domain of myosin motor in the muscle fibers. The distribution became only narrower upon muscle activation. ESR spectrum from the spin label of the neck-linker of dimeric kinesin motor consisted of immobilized and mobilized components and did not exhibit nucleotide-dependent mobility change. The distance between two labels of kinesin dimer was also measured by spin dipole-dipole interaction, showing a broad distribution and a nucleotide-dependent change on the nanometer scale (&gt;1.5 nm). These results suggest that two LC domains of myosin and two neck linkers of kinesin play a similar role for sliding movement using two conformations. The spin label of the skeletal (Tn)-I regulatory domain (TnIreg) showed a large mobility change by Ca2+ ion suggesting a Ca-induced switch movement of TnIreg. Spin dipole-dipole interaction showed that in reconstituted muscle fibers both skeletal and cardiac <e>TnC</e> undergo Ca2+-induced structural change that is thought to be essential for TnIreg movement. We also succeeded in fixing the newly-synthesized bifunctional spin label rigidly on the TnC molecule in solution, indicating that we can determine the precise coordinate of the spin principal axis of troponin on the oriented filament.",M2
16157639,"Crystal structure of troponin and the molecular mechanism of muscle regulation.Troponin plays a central role in the regulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction. The protein consists of three polypeptide chains (TnT, TnI and <e>TnC</e>) and is located on polymerized actin together with tropomyosin, forming muscle thin filament. We have determined the molecular structures of the core domains (relative molecular mass of 46,000 and 52,000) of human cardiac troponin in the Ca2+-saturated form by X-ray crystallography. Analysis of the four structures derived from the two crystal forms reveals that the core domain is further divided into sub-domains, connected by linkers, making the entire molecule highly flexible. The structures of the troponin ternary complex suggests that the Ca2+-binding to the regulatory TnC site displaces the carboxyl-terminal portion of TnI from actin/tropomyosin, thereby altering mobility and/or flexibility of the troponin/tropomyosin strand on the actin filament. These Ca2+-dependent changes in the properties of the tropomyosin strand on the actin filament may in turn alter accessibility of myosin heads (motor protein) to the actin filament.",M2
16131667,"Effects of Phe-to-Trp mutation and fluorotryptophan incorporation on the solution structure of cardiac troponin C, and analysis of its suitability as a potential probe for in situ NMR studies.19F NMR spectroscopy is potentially a powerful tool for probing protein properties in situ. However, results obtained using this technique are relevant only if the 19F probe offers minimal perturbation to the surrounding environment. In this paper, we examine the effect of 5-fluorotryptophan (5fW) incorporation on the three-dimensional structure of cardiac troponin-C (cTnC), with the intention of developing a 19F-labeled <e>TnC</e> for use in in situ 19FNMR. We find that, in general, 5fW does not perturb the structure of the protein significantly. Replacement of residue Phe 153 with 5fW produces no noticeable change in protein conformation. However, replacement of residue Phe 104 with 5fW produces a folding behavior that is dependent on the Escherichia coli strain used to express the mutant. The orientations of the indole rings in these mutants are such that the Trp residue adopts a chi2 of approximately 90 degrees in the F104W mutant and approximately -100 degrees in the F153W mutant. Using results from 19F-1H heteronuclear NOE experiment, we show the replacement of L-Trp with 5fW at these positions does not change the orientation of the indole ring and the spread of the 5fW side-chain dihedral angles increases moderately for the F104(5fW) mutant and not at all for the F153(5fW) mutant. Based on these structures, we conclude that the substitution of Phe by 5fW at these two positions has minimal effects on the structure of cTnC and that the 5fW indole rings in both mutants have well defined orientation, making the two mutants viable candidates for use in in situ 19F NMR spectroscopy.",M2
16128816,"Comparative studies on the functional roles of N- and C-terminal regions of molluskan and vertebrate troponin-I.Vertebrate troponin regulates muscle contraction through alternative binding of the C-terminal region of the inhibitory subunit, troponin-I (TnI), to actin or troponin-C (<e>TnC</e>) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this regulation by molluskan troponin, we compared the functional properties of the recombinant fragments of Akazara scallop TnI and rabbit fast skeletal TnI. The C-terminal fragment of Akazara scallop TnI (ATnI(232-292)), which contains the inhibitory region (residues 104-115 of rabbit TnI) and the regulatory TnC-binding site (residues 116-131), bound actin-tropomyosin and inhibited actomyosin-tropomyosin Mg-ATPase. However, it did not interact with TnC, even in the presence of Ca(2+). These results indicated that the mechanism involved in the alternative binding of this region was not observed in molluskan troponin. On the other hand, ATnI(130-252), which contains the structural TnC-binding site (residues 1-30 of rabbit TnI) and the inhibitory region, bound strongly to both actin and TnC. Moreover, the ternary complex consisting of this fragment, troponin-T, and TnC activated the ATPase in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner almost as effectively as intact Akazara scallop troponin. Therefore, Akazara scallop troponin regulates the contraction through the activating mechanisms that involve the region spanning from the structural TnC-binding site to the inhibitory region of TnI. Together with the observation that corresponding rabbit TnI-fragment (RTnI(1-116)) shows similar activating effects, these findings suggest the importance of the TnI N-terminal region not only for maintaining the structural integrity of troponin complex but also for Ca(2+)-dependent activation.",M2
16120452,"Arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) release from cardiac myofilaments.We investigated the initiation of Ca(2+)waves underlying triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) occurring in rat cardiac trabeculae under conditions that simulate the functional non-uniformity caused by mechanical or ischemic local damage of the myocardium. A mechanical discontinuity along the trabeculae was created by exposing the preparation to a small constant flow jet of solution with a composition that reduces excitation-contraction coupling in myocytes within that segment. Force was measured and sarcomere length as well as [Ca(2+)](i) were measured regionally. When the jet-contained Caffeine, BDM or Low-[Ca(2+)], muscle-twitch force decreased and the sarcomeres in the exposed segment were stretched by shortening of the normal regions outside the jet. During relaxation the sarcomeres in the exposed segment shortened rapidly. Short trains of stimulation at 2.5 Hz reproducibly caused Ca(2+)-waves to rise from the borders exposed to the jet. Ca(2+)-waves started during force relaxation of the last stimulated twitch and propagated into segments both inside and outside of the jet. Arrhythmias, in the form of non-driven rhythmic activity, were triggered when the amplitude of the Ca(2+)-wave increased by raising [Ca(2+)](o). The arrhythmias disappeared when the muscle uniformity was restored by turning the jet off. We have used the four state model of the cardiac cross bridge (Xb) with feedback of force development to Ca(2+) binding by Troponin-C (<e>TnC</e>) and observed that the force-Ca(2+) relationship as well as the force-sarcomere length relationship and the time course of the force and Ca(2+) transients in cardiac muscle can be reproduced faithfully by a single effect of force on deformation of the TnC.Ca complex and thereby on the dissociation rate of Ca(2+). Importantly, this feedback predicts that rapid decline of force in the activated sarcomere causes release of Ca(2+) from TnC.Ca(2+),which is sufficient to initiate arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results show that non-uniform contraction can cause Ca(2+)-waves underlying TPCs, and suggest that Ca(2+) dissociated from myofilaments plays an important role in the initiation of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+)-waves.",M2
16081096,"Role of the fetal and alpha/beta exons in the function of fast skeletal troponin T isoforms: correlation with altered Ca2+ regulation associated with development.In mammalian fast skeletal muscle, constitutive and alternative splicing from a single troponin T (TnT) gene produce multiple developmentally regulated and tissue specific TnT isoforms. Two exons, alpha (exon 16) and beta (exon 17), located near the 3' end of the gene and coding for two different 14 amino acid residue peptides are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner giving rise to the adult TnTalpha and the fetal TnTbeta isoforms. In addition, an acidic peptide coded by a fetal (f) exon located between exons 8 and 9 near the 5' end of the gene, is specifically present in TnTbeta and absent in the adult isoforms. To define the functional role of the f and alpha/beta exons, we constructed combinations of TnT cDNAs from a single human fetal fast skeletal TnTbeta cDNA clone in order to circumvent the problem of N-terminal sequence heterogeneity present in wild-type TnT isoforms, irrespective of the stage of development. Nucleotide sequences of these constructs, viz. TnTalpha, TnTalpha + f, TnTbeta - f and TnTbeta are identical, except for the presence or absence of the alpha or beta and f exons. Our results, using the recombinant TnT isoforms in different functional in vitro assays, show that the presence of the f peptide in the N-terminal T1 region of TnT, has a strong inhibitory effect on binary interactions between TnT and other thin filament proteins, TnI, <e>TnC</e> and Tm. The presence of the f peptide led to reduced Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in a reconstituted thin filament, whereas the contribution of the alpha and beta peptides in the biological activity of TnT was primarily modulatory. These results indicate that the f peptide confers an inhibitory effect on the biological function of fast skeletal TnT and this can be correlated with changes in the Ca2+ regulation associated with development in fast skeletal muscle.",M2
15826946,"Calcium-dependent changes in the flexibility of the regulatory domain of troponin C in the troponin complex.With the recent advances in structure determination of the troponin complex, it becomes even more important to understand the dynamics of its components and how they are affected by the presence or absence of Ca(2+). We used NMR techniques to study the backbone dynamics of skeletal troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) in the complex. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy pulse sequences and deuteration of TnC were essential to assign most of the TnC residues in the complex. Backbone amide (15)N relaxation times were measured in the presence of Ca(2+) or EGTA/Mg(2+). T(1) relaxation times could not be interpreted precisely, because for a molecule of this size, the longitudinal backbone amide (15)N relaxation rate due to chemical shift anisotropy and dipole-dipole interactions becomes too small, and other relaxation mechanisms become relevant. T(2) relaxation times were of the expected magnitude for a complex of this size, and most of the variation of T(2) times in the presence of Ca(2+) could be explained by the anisotropy of the complex, suggesting a relatively rigid molecule. The only exception was EF-hand site III and helix F immediately after, which are more flexible than the rest of the molecule. In the presence of EGTA/Mg(2+), relaxation times for residues in the C-domain of TnC are very similar to values in the presence of Ca(2+), whereas the N-domain becomes more flexible. Taken together with the high flexibility of the linker between the two domains, we concluded that in the absence of Ca(2+), the N-domain of TnC moves independently from the rest of the complex.",M2

We prepared two hcTnC mutants (C35S and C84S) containing one native cysteine residue (84 and 35, respectively) for spin labelling. The mutants were labelled with a methane thiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL) and the <e>TnC</e> was reconstituted into permeabilized muscle fibres. The mobility of Cys84-MTSSL changed markedly after addition of Ca2+, while that of the Cys35 residue did not change in the monomer state or in fibres. The rotational correlation time of Cys84-MTSSL decreased from 32ns to 13ns upon Ca(2+)-binding in the monomer state, whereas in fibres the spectrum of Cys84-MTSSL was resolved into mobile (16ns) and immobile (35ns) components and the addition of Ca2+ increased the immobile component. Moreover, the accessibility of Cys84-MTSSL to molecular oxygen increased slightly in the presence of Ca2+. These data suggest that Cys35 remains in the same location regardless of the addition of Ca2+, whereas Cys84 is located at the position that interacts with B and C helices of hcTnC and interacts with troponin I (TnI) at high concentrations of Ca2+. We determined the distances between Cys35 and Cys84 by measuring pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectra. The distances were 26.0 angstroms and 27.2 angstroms in the monomer state and in fibres, respectively, and the addition of Ca2+ decreased the distance to 23.2 angstroms in fibres but only slightly in the monomer state, showing that Ca2+ binding to the N-domain of hcTnC induced a larger structural change in muscle fibres than in the monomer state.",M2
15784741,"Ca(2+)-regulated structural changes in troponin.Troponin senses Ca2+ to regulate contraction in striated muscle. Structures of skeletal muscle troponin composed of <e>TnC</e> (the sensor), TnI (the regulator), and TnT (the link to the muscle thin filament) have been determined. The structure of troponin in the Ca(2+)-activated state features a nearly twofold symmetrical assembly of TnI and TnT subunits penetrated asymmetrically by the dumbbell-shaped TnC subunit. Ca ions are thought to regulate contraction by controlling the presentation to and withdrawal of the TnI inhibitory segment from the thin filament. Here, we show that the rigid central helix of the sensor binds the inhibitory segment of TnI in the Ca(2+)-activated state. Comparison of crystal structures of troponin in the Ca(2+)-activated state at 3.0 angstroms resolution and in the Ca(2+)-free state at 7.0 angstroms resolution shows that the long framework helices of TnI and TnT, presumed to be a Ca(2+)-independent structural domain of troponin are unchanged. Loss of Ca ions causes the rigid central helix of the sensor to collapse and to release the inhibitory segment of TnI. The inhibitory segment of TnI changes conformation from an extended loop in the presence of Ca2+ to a short alpha-helix in its absence. We also show that Anapoe, a detergent molecule, increases the contractile force of muscle fibers and binds specifically, together with the TnI switch helix, in a hydrophobic pocket of TnC upon activation by Ca ions.",M2
15752712,"Functional importance of Ca2+-deficient N-terminal lobe of molluscan troponin C in troponin regulation.Ca(2+)-binding sites I and II in the N-terminal lobe of molluscan troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) have lost the ability to bind Ca(2+) due to substitutions of the amino acid residues responsible for Ca(2+) liganding. To evaluate the functional importance of the Ca(2+)-deficient N-terminal lobe in the Ca(2+)-regulatory function of molluscan troponin, we constructed chimeric TnCs comprising the N-terminal lobes from rabbit fast muscle and squid mantle muscle TnCs and the C-terminal lobe from akazara scallop TnC, TnC(RA), and TnC(SA), respectively. We characterized their biochemical properties as compared with those of akazara scallop wild-type TnC (TnC(AA)). According to equilibrium dialysis using (45)Ca(2+), TnC(RA), and TnC(SA) bound stoichiometrically 3 mol Ca(2+)/mol and 1 mol Ca(2+)/mol, respectively, as expected from their primary structures. All the chimeric TnCs exhibited difference-UV-absorption spectra at around 280-290 nm upon Ca(2+) binding and formed stable complexes with akazara scallop troponin I, even in the presence of 6M urea, if Ca(2+) was present. However, when the troponin complexes were constructed from chimeric TnCs and akazara scallop troponin T and troponin I, they showed different Ca(2+)-regulation abilities from each other depending on the TnC species. Thus, the troponin containing TnC(SA) conferred as high a Ca(2+) sensitivity to Mg-ATPase activity of rabbit actomyosin-akazara scallop tropomyosin as did the troponin containing TnC(AA), whereas the troponin containing TnC(RA) conferred virtually no Ca(2+) sensitivity. Our findings indicate that the N-terminal lobe of molluscan TnC plays important roles in molluscan troponin regulation, despite its inability to bind Ca(2+).",M2
15705058,"Effects of troponin C isoform on the action of the cardiotonic agent EMD 57033.The effects of the cardiotonic potentiator EMD 57033 on different <e>TnC</e> (troponin C) isoforms were investigated. Endogenous skeletal TnC was extracted from glycerinated, permeabilized rabbit psoas fibres and replaced with either purified native rabbit psoas TnC (fast TnC) or human recombinant cTnC (cardiac TnC) (3 mg/ml in relaxing solution for 30 min). In both conditions, 10 microM EMD 57033 increased maximal calcium-activated force (Pmax) and gave a leftward shift in the pCa-tension curve. With cTnC, the increase in Pmax was much greater (228%) compared with the effect seen for fast TnC (137%), which was the same as that in unextracted control fibres. When the whole troponin was replaced rather than just TnC, the effects of EMD 57033 on fibres replaced with cTn were the same as with the cTnC subunit alone, except that the force at low Ca2+ concentrations was not increased as much. If TnC was only partially extracted, it was found that the degree of extraction did not influence the effect of EMD 57033, except when force was decreased to below 10% of the pre-extraction Pmax. Dynamic stiffness was not altered by EMD 57033 in any of the preparations. The rate of tension recovery following a release-restretch method (ktr) was decreased by EMD 57033. We conclude that EMD 57033 acts by a rate-modulating effect, and that the quantitative response of this effect is dependent on the TnC isoform present.",M2
15670158,"Mapping contacts between regulatory domains of skeletal muscle <e>TnC</e> and TnI by analyses of single-chain chimeras.The troponin (Tn) complex is formed by TnC, TnI and TnT and is responsible for the calcium-dependent inhibition of muscle contraction. TnC and TnI interact in an antiparallel fashion in which the N domain of TnC binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the C domain of TnI, releasing the inhibitory effect of the latter on the actomyosin interaction. While the crystal structure of the core cardiac muscle troponin complex has been determined, very little high resolution information is available regarding the skeletal muscle TnI-TnC complex. With the aim of obtaining structural information regarding specific contacts between skeletal muscle TnC and TnI regulatory domains, we have constructed two recombinant chimeric proteins composed of the residues 1-91 of TnC linked to residues 98-182 or 98-147 of TnI. The polypeptides were capable of binding to the thin filament in a calcium-dependent manner and to regulate the ATPase reaction of actomyosin. Small angle X-ray scattering results showed that these chimeras fold into compact structures in which the inhibitory plus the C domain of TnI, with the exception of residues 148-182, were in close contact with the N-terminal domain of TnC. CD and fluorescence analysis were consistent with the view that the last residues of TnI (148-182) are not well folded in the complex. MS analysis of fragments produced by limited trypsinolysis showed that the whole TnC N domain was resistant to proteolysis, both in the presence and in the absence of calcium. On the other hand the TnI inhibitory and C-terminal domains were completely digested by trypsin in the absence of calcium while the addition of calcium results in the protection of only residues 114-137.",M2
15632309,"Differential pH effect on calcium-induced conformational changes of cardiac troponin C complexed with cardiac and fast skeletal isoforms of troponin I and troponin T.The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular events associated with the deleterious effects of acidosis on the contractile properties of cardiac muscle as in the ischemia of heart failure. We have conducted a study of the effects of increasing acidity on the Ca(2+) induced conformational changes of pyrene labelled cardiac troponin C (PIA-cTnC) in isolation and in complex with porcine cardiac or chicken pectoral skeletal muscle TnI and/or TnT. The pyrene label has been shown to serve as a useful fluorescence reporter group for conformational and interaction events of the N-terminal regulatory domain of <e>TnC</e> with only minimal fluorescence changes associated with C-terminal domain. Results obtained show that the significant decreases at pH 6.0 of site II Ca(2+) affinity of PIA-cTnC when complexed as a binary complex with either cTnI or cTnT are significantly reduced when cTnI is replaced with sTnI or cTnT with sTnT. However, this effect is appreciably diminished when the cTnI and cTnT in the ternary complex are replaced by sTnI and sTnT. The smaller effects in the ternary complex of replacing both cTnI and cTnT by their skeletal counterparts on depressing the Ca(2+) affinity from pH 7.0 to 6.0 arise from TnI replacement. Thus, changes in TnC conformation resulting from isoform-specific interactions with TnI and TnT could be an integral part of the effect of pH on myofilament Ca(2+)sensitivity.",M2
15628883,"Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance study of the calcium-induced structural transition in the N-domain of human cardiac troponin C complexed with troponin I.Calcium-induced structural transition in the amino-terminal domain of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) triggers skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction. The salient feature of this structural transition is the movement of the B and C helices, which is termed the  opening  of the N-domain. This movement exposes a hydrophobic region, allowing interaction with the regulatory domain of troponin I (TnI) as can be seen in the crystal structure of the troponin ternary complex [Takeda, S., Yamashita, A., Maeda, K., and Maeda, Y. (2003) Nature 424, 35-41]. In contrast to skeletal TnC, Ca(2+)-binding site I (an EF-hand motif that consists of an A helix-loop-B helix motif) is inactive in cardiac TnC. The question arising from comparisons with skeletal TnC is how both helices move according to Ca(2+) binding or interact with TnI in cardiac TnC. In this study, we examined the Ca(2+)-induced movement of the B and C helices relative to the D helix in a cardiac TnC monomer state and TnC-TnI binary complex by means of site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Doubly spin-labeled TnC mutants were prepared, and the spin-spin distances were estimated by analyzing dipolar interactions with the Fourier deconvolution method. An interspin distance of 18.4 A was estimated for mutants spin labeled at G42C on the B helix and C84 on the D helix in a Mg(2+)-saturated monomer state. The interspin distance between Q58C on the C helix and C84 on the D helix was estimated to be 18.3 A under the same conditions. Distance changes were observed by the addition of Ca(2+) ions and the formation of a complex with TnI. Our data indicated that the C helix moved away from the D helix in a distinct Ca(2+)-dependent manner, while the B helix did not. A movement of the B helix by interaction with TnI was observed. Both Ca(2+) and TnI were also shown to be essential for the full opening of the N-domain in cardiac TnC.",M2
15611027,"Cardiac troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and a site I skeletal TnC mutant alter Ca2+ versus crossbridge contribution to force in rabbit skeletal fibres.We studied the relative contributions of Ca(2+) binding to troponin C (TnC) and myosin binding to actin in activating thin filaments of rabbit psoas fibres. The ability of Ca(2+) to activate thin filaments was reduced by replacing native TnC with cardiac TnC (cTnC) or a site I-inactive skeletal TnC mutant (xsTnC). Acto-myosin (crossbridge) interaction was either inhibited using N-benzyl-p-toluene sulphonamide (BTS) or enhanced by lowering [ATP] from 5.0 to 0.5 mm. Reconstitution with cTnC reduced maximal force (F(max)) by approximately 1/3 and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force (pCa(50)) by 0.17 unit (P &lt; 0.001), while reconstitution with xsTnC reduced F(max) by approximately 2/3 and pCa(50) by 0.19 unit (P &lt; 0.001). In both cases the apparent cooperativity of activation (n(H)) was greatly decreased. In control fibres 3 mum BTS inhibited force to 57% of F(max) while in fibres reconstituted with cTnC or xsTnC, reconstituted maximal force (rF(max)) was inhibited to 8.8% and 14.3%, respectively. Under control conditions 3 mum BTS significantly decreased the pCa(50), but this effect was considerably reduced in cTnC reconstituted fibres, and eliminated in xsTnC reconstituted fibres. In contrast, when crossbridge cycle kinetics were slowed by lowering [ATP] from 5 to 0.5 mm in xsTnC reconstituted fibres, pCa(50) and n(H) were increased towards control values. Combined, our results demonstrate that when the ability of Ca(2+) binding to activate thin filaments is compromised, the relative contribution of strong crossbridges to maintain thin filament activation is increased. Furthermore, the data suggest that at low levels of Ca(2+), the level of thin filament activation is determined primarily by the direct effects of Ca(2+) on tropomyosin mobility, while at higher levels of Ca(2+) the final level of thin filament activation is primarily determined by strong cycling crossbridges.",M2
15589995,"Evaluation of the cross-bridge-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of troponin C in aequorin-injected ferret ventricular muscles.Ca2+ affinity of cardiac troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) is regulated by the active cross-bridges (downstream-dependent mechanism). In the present study, we showed one of the methods to evaluate the downstream-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC during contraction using the aequorin-injected ferret papillary muscle. For this purpose, the tension-dependent change in the extra-Ca2+ (a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to a quick length reduction) was measured under various conditions. We examined whether the regression line between the magnitude of tension reduction and the magnitude of the normalized extra-Ca2+ (the extra-Ca2+ was divided by [Ca2+]i immediately before length change) (the normalized extra-Ca2+-tension relation) in twitch contraction can be used for the estimation of the downstream-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC. The normalized extra-Ca2+-tension relation became shallow by EMD 57033 (EMD) (one of the Ca2+ sensitizers) and by an increase in Ca2+ concentration in the solution ([Ca2+]o) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) (one of the desensitizers) antagonized the effects of EMD and higher [Ca2+]o in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects of EMD and BDM were also observed in the normalized extra-Ca2+-tension relation in tetanic contraction. The normalized extra-Ca2+-tension relation became steep by shortening the initial muscle length before contraction in tetanic contraction. Length-tension relation in twitch contraction was significantly shifted upward by higher [Ca2+]o and EMD, but BDM showed the opposite effects on them in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the downstream-dependent change in the Ca2+ affinity of TnC which physiologically functions in intact cardiac muscle can be evaluated using the normalized extra-Ca2+-tension relation.",M2
15351646,"Conformational changes of troponin C within the thin filaments detected by neutron scattering.Regulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction is associated with structural changes of the thin filament-based proteins, troponin consisting of three subunits (<e>TnC</e>, TnI, and TnT), tropomyosin, and actin, triggered by Ca2+-binding to TnC. Knowledge of in situ structures of these proteins is indispensable for elucidating the molecular mechanism of this Ca2+-sensitive regulation. Here, the in situ structure of TnC within the thin filaments was investigated with neutron scattering, combined with selective deuteration and the contrast matching technique. Deuterated TnC (dTnC) was first prepared, this dTnC was then reconstituted into the native thin filaments, and finally neutron scattering patterns of these reconstituted thin filaments containing dTnC were measured under the condition where non-deuterated components were rendered  invisible  to neutrons. The obtained scattering curves arising only from dTnC showed distinct difference in the absence and presence of Ca2+. These curves were analyzed by model calculations using the Monte Carlo method, in which inter-dTnC interference was explicitly taken into consideration. The model calculation showed that in situ radius of gyration of TnC was 23 A (99% confidence limits between 22 A and 23 A) and 24 A (99% confidence limits between 23 A and 25 A) in the absence and presence of Ca2+, respectively, indicating that TnC within the thin filaments assumes a conformation consistent with the extended dumbbell structure, which is different from the structures found in the crystals of various Tn complexes. Elongation of TnC by binding of Ca2+ was also suggested. Furthermore, the radial position of TnC within the thin filament was estimated to be 53 A (99% confidence limits between 49 A and 57 A) and 49 A (99% confidence limits between 44 A and 53 A) in the absence and presence of Ca2+, respectively, suggesting that this radial movement of TnC by 4A is associated with large conformational changes of the entire Tn molecule by binding of Ca2+.",M2
15196987,"Stability and folding studies of the N-domain of troponin C.

Unfolding was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy using urea, pH, and temperature as denaturants, in the absence and in the presence of calcium. The unfolding of TnC(1-91)F29W was reversible and did not follow a two-state transition, suggesting that an intermediate may be present during this reaction. Our results support the hypothesis that intermediates are likely to occur during the folding of small proteins and domains. The physiological significance of the presence of an intermediate in the folding pathway of troponin C is discussed.",M2
15183295,"An interfering component in cardiac troponin I immunoassays-Its nature and inhibiting effect on the binding of antibodies against different epitopes.OBJECTIVES: We recently reported on the occurrence of a common interfering factor (IF) that negatively affects determinations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The aim of the present investigation was to extend our initial finding by a detailed epitope-based determination of the location of IF and to reveal the approximate size and characteristics of IF. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two-site immunoassays using combinations of 16 monoclonal and 2 polyclonal cTnI antibodies and 1 monoclonal troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) antibody were used to measure the analytical recovery of cTnI or cTnI-TnC in serum samples. Gel filtration of serum samples containing IF was performed and the analytical recovery of cTnI in the fractions was determined. EDTA-plasma samples to which cTnI had been added and serum samples containing endogenous cTnI were also separated by gel filtration. RESULTS: The mean analytical recoveries of cTnI were 28.3% (range 7.5-55.1%) and of cTnI-TnC were 23.5% (range 8.7-51.8%) in samples containing IF when antibodies against midfragment epitopes of cTnI were used. The mean recovery of cTnI was 65.1% and 73.3% for antibodies with N- and C-terminal epitopes. Gel filtration of samples with low recovery of cTnI showed that the approximate molecular mass of IF was 50-200 kDa and that the cTnI elution profiles of samples containing IF were shifted towards higher molecular mass compared with samples with less IF. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against midfragment epitopes of cTnI are affected by IF to a considerable but variable extent, and the presence of IF can be demonstrated by gel filtration.",M2
15137099,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study on the binding of Mg2+ to a mutant Akazara scallop troponin C (E142Q).Troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) is the Ca(2+)-binding regulatory protein of the troponin complex in muscle tissue. Vertebrate fast skeletal muscle TnCs bind four Ca(2+), while Akazara scallop (Chlamys nipponensis akazara) striated adductor muscle TnC binds only one Ca(2+) at site IV, because all the other EF-hand motifs are short of critical residues for the coordination of Ca(2+). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied to study coordination structure of Mg(2+) bound in a mutant Akazara scallop TnC (E142Q) in D(2)O solution. The result showed that the side-chain COO(-) groups of Asp 131 and Asp 133 in the Ca(2+)-binding site of E142Q bind to Mg(2+) in the pseudo-bridging mode. Mg(2+) titration experiments for E142Q and the wild-type of Akazara scallop TnC were performed by monitoring the band at about 1600 cm(-1), which is due to the pseudo-bridging Asp COO(-) groups. As a result, the binding constants of them for Mg(2+) were the same value (about 6 mM). Therefore, it was concluded that the side-chain COO(-) group of Glu 142 of the wild type has no relation to the Mg(2+) ligation. The effect of Mg(2+) binding in E142Q was also investigated by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The on-off mechanism of the activation of Akazara scallop TnC is discussed on the basis of the coordination structures of Mg(2+) as well as Ca(2+).",M2
15134451,"NMR and mutagenesis studies on the phosphorylation region of human cardiac troponin I.Phosphorylation of the cardiac troponin complex by PKA at S22 and S23 of troponin I (TnI) accelerates Ca(2+) release from troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). The region of TnI around the bisphosphorylation site binds to, and stabilizes, the Ca(2+) bound N-terminal domain of TnC. Phosphorylation interferes with this interaction between TnI and TnC resulting in weaker Ca(2+) binding. In this study, we used (1)H-(15)N-HSQC NMR to investigate at the atomic level the interaction between an N-terminal fragment of TnI consisting of residues 1-64 of TnI (I1-64) and TnC. We produced several mutants of I1-64, TnI, and TnC to test the contribution of certain residues to the transmission of the phosphorylation signal in both NMR experiments and functional assays. We also investigated how phosphorylation of the PKC sites in I1-64 (S41 and S43) affects the interaction of I1-64 with TnC. We found that phosphorylation of S22 and S23 produced only localized effects in the structure of I1-64 between residues 24 and 34. Residues 1-17 of I1-64 did not bind to TnC, and residues 38-64 bound tightly to the C-terminal domain of TnC regardless of phosphorylation. Residues 22-34 bound weakly to TnC in a phosphorylation sensitive manner. Bisphosphorylation prevented this phosphorylation switch region from interacting with TnC. Systematic mutation of residues in the phosphorylation switch did not prevent PKA phosphorylation from accelerating Ca(2+) release from troponin. We conclude that the phosphorylation switch binds to TnC via an extended interaction site spanning residues R19 to A34.",M2
15098700,"Myofibrillar determinants of rate of relaxation in skinned skeletal muscle fibers.The influence of Ca2+ dissociation rate from <e>TnC</e> and decreased cross-bridge detachment rate on the time course of relaxation induced by flash photolysis of diazo-2 in rabbit skinned psoas fibers was investigated at 15 degrees C. A TnC mutant (M82Q TnC) that exhibited increased Ca2+ sensitivity caused by a decreased Ca2+ dissociation rate in solution also increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force and decreased the rate of relaxation in fibers approximately 2-fold. In contrast, a TnC mutant (NHdel TnC) with decreased Ca2+ sensitivity caused by an increased Ca2+ dissociation rate in solution decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force but did not accelerate relaxation. Decreasing the rate of cross-bridge kinetics by reducing [Pi] slowed relaxation -2-fold and led to two phases of relaxation, a linear phase followed by an exponential phase. In fibers, M82Q TnC further slowed relaxation in low [Pi] approximately 2-fold whereas NHdel TnC had no significant effect on relaxation. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Ca2+ dissociation rate and cross-bridge detachment rate are similar in fast twitch skeletal muscle such that decreasing either rate slows relaxation but accelerating Ca2+ dissociation has little effect on relaxation.",M2
15098675,"Orientation and motion of myosin light chain and troponin in reconstituted muscle fibers as detected by ESR with a new bifunctional spin label.Using electron spin resonance, we have studied dynamic structures of myosin neck domain and troponin C by site-directed spin labeling. We observed two broad but distinct orientations of a spin label attached specifically to a single cysteine (cys156) on the regulatoy light chain (RLC) of myosin in relaxed skeletal muscle fibers. The two probe orientations, separated by a 25 degrees axial rotation, did not change upon muscle activation, but orientational distributions became narrower substantially, indicating that a fraction of myosin heads undergoes a disorder-to-order transition of the myosin light chain domain upon force generation and muscle contraction. These results provide insight into the mechanism how myosin heads move their domains to translocate an actin filament. Site-directed spin-labeling was achieved by cysteine residues of human cardiac troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). Spin dipole-dipole interaction showed that free TnC undergoes a global structural change (extended-to-compact) by Ca2+ or Mg2+. The spectra from the spin labels at N-terminal half domain were broad and almost identical in parallel and perpendicular orientations of fiber, suggesting that the N-terminal of TnC molecule is flexible or disoriented with respect to the filament axis. We also succeeded, for the first time, in fixing the newly-synthesized bifunctional spin label rigidly on TnC molecule in solution (either in +/- Ca2+), giving a promise that we can determine the precise coordinate of the spin principal axis on protein surface.",M2
15049709,"Characterization of the interaction between the N-terminal extension of human cardiac troponin I and troponin C.The N-terminal extension of cardiac troponin I (TnI) is bisphosphorylated by protein kinase A in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. How this signal is transmitted between TnI and troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), resulting in accelerated Ca(2+) release, remains unclear. We recently proposed that the unphosphorylated extension interacts with the N-terminal domain of TnC stabilizing Ca(2+) binding and that phosphorylation prevents this interaction. We now use (1)H NMR to study the interactions between several N-terminal fragments of TnI, residues 1-18 (I1-18), residues 1-29 (I1-29), and residues 1-64 (I1-64), and TnC. The shorter fragments provide unambiguous information on the N-terminal regions of TnI that interact with TnC: I1-18 does not bind to TnC whereas the C-terminal region of unphosphorylated I1-29 does bind. Bisphosphorylation greatly weakens this interaction. I1-64 contains the phosphorylatable N-terminal extension and a region that anchors I1-64 to the C-terminal domain of TnC. I1-64 binding to TnC influences NMR signals arising from both domains of TnC, providing evidence that the N-terminal extension of TnI interacts with the N-terminal domain of TnC. TnC binding to I1-64 broadens NMR signals from the side chains of residues immediately C-terminal to the phosphorylation sites. Binding of TnC to bisphosphorylated I1-64 does not broaden these NMR signals to the same extent. Circular dichroism spectra of I1-64 indicate that bisphosphorylation does not produce major secondary structure changes in I1-64. We conclude that bisphosphorylation of cardiac TnI elicits its effects by weakening the interaction between the region of TnI immediately C-terminal to the phosphorylation sites and TnC either directly, due to electrostatic repulsion, or via localized conformational changes.",M2
14985239,"Troponin C isoform composition determines differences in Sr(2+)-activation characteristics between rat diaphragm fibers.Single fibers of rat diaphragm containing different naturally occurring combinations of myofibrillar protein isoforms were used to evaluate the contribution of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) isoforms to fiber type-related differences with respect to sensitivity to Sr(2+) of the contractile system. Mechanically skinned fibers were studied for their isometric force vs. Sr(2+) concentration ([Sr(2+)]) relationships and then analyzed electrophoretically for myofibrillar protein isoform composition. Our data demonstrate that fiber-type differences in Sr(2+) dependence of contractile activation processes are primarily determined by the TnC isoform composition, with the slow isoform conferring on average a sevenfold greater sensitivity to Sr(2+) than the fast isoform. Moreover, the ratio of TnC isoforms determined functionally from the force-pSr (-log(10) [Sr(2+)]) curves is tightly (r(2) = 0.97) positively correlated with that estimated electrophoretically. Together, these results validate the use of Sr(2+) activation characteristics to distinguish fibers containing different proportions of fast and slow TnC isoforms and to study the mechanisms by which divalent cations activate the contractile apparatus. We also found that the functionally and electrophoretically determined ratios of TnC isoforms present in a fiber display similar sigmoidal relationships with the ratio of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform types expressed. These relationships 1) offer further insight in the functional and molecular expression of TnC in relation to the molecular expression of MHC isoform types and 2) may provide the basis for predicting sensitivity to Sr(2+), TnC, and MHC isoforms in pure and hybrid skeletal muscle fibers.",M2

14765112,"A troponin switch that regulates muscle contraction by stretch instead of calcium.The flight muscles of many insects have a form of regulation enabling them to contract at high frequencies. The muscles are activated by periodic stretches at low Ca2+ levels. The same muscles also give isometric contractions in response to higher Ca2+. We show that the two activities are controlled by different isoforms of <e>TnC</e> (F1 and F2) within single myofibrils. F1 binds one Ca2+ with high affinity in the C-terminal domain and F2 binds one Ca2+ in the C-terminal domain and one exchangeable Ca2+ in the N-terminal domain. We have characterised the isoforms and determined their effect on the development of stretch-activated and Ca2+-activated tension by replacing endogenous TnC in Lethocerus flight muscle fibres with recombinant isoforms. Fibres with F1 gave stretch-activated tension and minimal isometric tension; those with F2 gave Ca2+-dependent isometric tension and minimal stretch-activated tension. Regulation by a TnC responding to stretch rather than Ca2+ is unprecedented and has resulted in the ability of insect flight muscle to perform oscillatory work at low Ca2+ concentrations, a property to which a large number of flying insects owe their evolutionary success.",M2
14572306,"A single-fibre study of the relationship between MHC and <e>TnC</e> isoform composition in rat skeletal muscle.In the present study, we investigated the possibility that MHC (myosin heavy chain) and TnC (troponin C) isoforms exist in specific combinations in rat-skeletal-muscle fibres. Single fibres (numbering 245) from soleus (predominantly slow-twitch) and sternomastoid (predominantly fast-twitch) muscles of adult rats were analysed for MHC and TnC isoform composition, using alanine-SDS/PAGE for separating MHC isoforms, and a novel method (based on the previously reported influence of Ca2+ on the mobility of Ca2+-binding proteins in SDS gels) for unequivocal identification of TnC isoforms in single-fibre segments. In this study, all fibres that contained only one MHC isoform (slow or fast) contained only the matching TnC isoform and all fibres that contained multiple fast MHC isoforms contained only the fast TnC isoform. Fibres expressing both slow and fast MHC isoforms displayed either both TnC isoforms or only one TnC isoform of a type depending on the relative proportion of fast/slow MHC present. Our results suggest a close relationship between MHC and TnC isoform composition in non-transforming skeletal muscles of adult rat.",M2
14534082,"Ca transients from Ca channel activity in rat cardiac myocytes reveal dynamics of dyad cleft and troponin C Ca binding.The properties of the dyad cleft can in principle significantly impact excitation-contraction coupling, but these properties are not easily amenable to experimental investigation. We simultaneously measured the time course of the rise in integrated Ca current (ICa) and the rise in concentration of fura 2 with Ca bound ([Ca-fura 2]) with high time resolution in rat myocytes for conditions under which Ca entry is only via L-type Ca channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release is blocked, and compared these measurements with predictions from a finite-element model of cellular Ca diffusion. We found that 1) the time course of the rise of [Ca-fura 2] follows the time course of integrated ICa plus a brief delay (1.36 +/- 0.43 ms, n = 6 cells); 2) from the model, high-affinity Ca binding sites in the dyad cleft at the level previously envisioned would result in a much greater delay (&gt;/=3 ms) and are therefore unlikely to be present at that level; 3) including ATP in the model promoted Ca efflux from the dyad cleft by a factor of 1.57 when low-affinity cleft Ca binding sites were present; 4) the data could only be fit to the model if myofibrillar troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) Ca binding were low affinity (4.56 microM), like that of soluble troponin C, instead of the high-affinity value usually used (0.38 microM). In a  good model,  the rate constants for Ca binding and dissociation were 0.375 times the values for soluble TnC; and 5) consequently, intracellular Ca buffering at the rise of the Ca transient is inferred to be low.",M2
12967628,"Interaction of levosimendan with cardiac troponin C in the presence of cardiac troponin I peptides.The interaction between troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and troponin I (TnI) is essential for the regulation of muscle contraction. There are several binding sites for TnI on TnC that are differentially occupied depending on the phase of the contraction/relaxation cycle. TnI and TnC interact in an antiparallel fashion with each other. The C-domain of cTnC and the N-domain region of cTnI(residues 33-70) always interact under physiological conditions, whereas the interaction between regulatory regions of TnC and TnI (residues 128-166) is calcium dependent. Previously, it has been shown that levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer used as a treatment for acute heart failure, can interact with both domains of isolated cTnC. To understand which interaction is relevant for the mechanism of calcium sensitization, we used a more complete troponin model obtained by complexing cTnI(32-79) and cTnI(128-180) with calcium-saturated cTnC(CS). The cTnI peptides bound to cTnC(CS) to form a 1:1:1 complex. The interaction of levosimendan with this complex was followed by 1H-(15)N heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy. It was clear that based on chemical shift changes, cTnI(32-79) blocked the levosimendan interaction sites on the C-domain, whereas cTnI(128-180) did not compete with levosimendan for the binding site on the N-domain. Hence, the effective binding site of levosimendan on cTnC resulting in the calcium-sensitizing effect is located in the regulatory domain (N-domain).",M2
12939162,"A cross-linking study of the N-terminal extension of human cardiac troponin I.Phosphorylation of the unique N-terminal extension of cardiac troponin I (TnI) by PKA modulates Ca(2+) release from the troponin complex. The mechanism by which phosphorylation affects Ca(2+) binding, however, remains unresolved. To investigate this question, we have studied the interaction of a fragment of TnI consisting of residues 1-64 (I1-64) with troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) by isothermal titration microcalorimetry and cross-linking. I1-64 binds extremely tightly to the C-terminal domain of TnC and weakly to the N-terminal domain. Binding to the N-domain is weakened further by phosphorylation. Using the heterobifunctional cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide and four separate cysteine mutants of I1-64 (S5C, E10C, I18C, R26C), we have probed the protein-protein interactions of the N-terminal extension. All four I1-64 mutants cross-link to the N-terminal domain of TnC. The cross-linking is enhanced by Ca(2+) and reduced by phosphorylation. By introducing the same monocysteine mutations into full-length TnI, we were able to probe the environment of the N-terminal extension in intact troponin. We find that the full length of the extension lies in close proximity to both TnC and troponin T (TnT). Ca(2+) enhances the cross-linking to TnC. Cross-linking to both TnC and TnT is reduced by prior phosphorylation of the TnI. In binary complexes the mutant TnIs cross-link to both the isolated TnC N-domain and whole TnC. Cyanogen bromide digestion of the covalent TnI-TnC complex formed from intact troponin demonstrates that cross-linking is predominantly to the N-terminal domain of TnC.",M2
12909700,"Temperature and the expression of seven muscle-specific protein genes during embryogenesis in the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L.Seven cDNA clones coding for different muscle-specific proteins (MSPs) were isolated from the fast muscle tissue of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes was used to characterize the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression with respect to somite stage in embryos incubated at 4 degrees C, 7 degrees C and 10 degrees C. MyoD transcripts were first observed in the presomitic mesoderm prior to somite formation, and in the lateral compartment of the forming somites. MyoD expression was not observed in the adaxial cells that give rise to the slow muscle layer, and expression was undetectable by in situ hybridization in the lateral somitic mesoderm after the 35-somite stage, during development of the final approximately 15 somites. RT-PCR analysis, however, confirmed the presence of low levels of the transcript during these later stages. A phylogenetic comparison of the deduced aminoacid sequences of the full-length MyoD cDNA clone and those from other teleosts, and inference from the in situ expression pattern suggested homology with a second paralogue (MyoD2) recently isolated from the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. Following MyoD expression, alpha-actin was the first structural gene to be switched on at the 16-somite stage, followed by myosin heavy chain, troponin T, troponin I and muscle creatine kinase. The final mRNA in the series to be expressed was troponin C. All genes were switched on prior to myofibril assembly. The troponin C sequence was unusual in that it showed the greatest sequence identity with the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss cardiac/slow form, but was expressed in the fast myotomal muscle and not in the heart. In addition, the third <e>TnC</e> calcium binding site showed a lower level of sequence conservation than the rest of the sequence. No differences were seen in the timing of appearance or rate of posterior progression (relative to somite stage) of any MSP transcripts between embryos raised at the different temperatures. It was concluded that myofibrillar genes are activated asynchronously in a distinct temporal order prior to myofibrillar assembly and that this process was highly canalized over the temperature range studied.",M2
12846843,"Calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions induce changes in proximity relationships of Cys48 and Cys64 in chicken skeletal troponin I.The goal of this study was to relate conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of chicken troponin I (TnI) to Ca2+ activation of the actin-myosin interaction. The two cysteine residues in this region (Cys48 and Cys64) were labeled with two sulfhydryl-reactive pyrene-containing fluorophores [N-(1-pyrene)maleimide, and N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide]. The labeled TnI showed a typical fluorescence spectrum: two sharp peaks of monomer fluorescence and a broad peak of excimer fluorescence arising from the formation of an excited dimer (excimer). Results obtained show that forming a binary complex of labeled TnI with skeletal <e>TnC</e> (sTnC) in the absence of Ca2+ decreases the excimer fluorescence, indicating a separation of the two residues. This reduction in excimer fluorescence does not occur when labeled TnI is complexed with cardiac TnC (cTnC). The latter causes only partial activation of the Ca2+-dependent myofibrillar ATPase. The binding of Ca2+ to the two N-terminal sites of sTnC causes a significant decrease in excimer fluorescence and an increase in monomer fluorescence in complexes of labeled TnI with skeletal TnC or TnC/TnT, while Ca2+ binding to site II of cTnC only causes an increase in monomer fluorescence but no change in excimer fluorescence. Thus a conformational change in the N-terminal region of TnI may be necessary for full activation of muscle contraction.",M2
12840750,"Structure of the core domain of human cardiac troponin in the Ca(2+)-saturated form.Troponin is essential in Ca(2+) regulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction. It consists of three subunits (TnT, <e>TnC</e> and TnI) and, together with tropomyosin, is located on the actin filament. Here we present crystal structures of the core domains (relative molecular mass of 46,000 and 52,000) of human cardiac troponin in the Ca(2+)-saturated form. Analysis of the four-molecule structures reveals that the core domain is further divided into structurally distinct subdomains that are connected by flexible linkers, making the entire molecule highly flexible. The alpha-helical coiled-coil formed between TnT and TnI is integrated in a rigid and asymmetric structure (about 80 angstrom long), the IT arm, which bridges putative tropomyosin-anchoring regions. The structures of the troponin ternary complex imply that Ca(2+) binding to the regulatory site of TnC removes the carboxy-terminal portion of TnI from actin, thereby altering the mobility and/or flexibility of troponin and tropomyosin on the actin filament.",M2
12767223,"Effect of temperature and the F27W mutation on the Ca2+ activated structural transition of trout cardiac troponin C.The Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac contractile element is reduced at lower temperatures, in contrast to that in fast skeletal muscle. Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) replacement in mammalian skinned fibers showed that <e>TnC</e> plays a critical role in this phenomenon (Harrison and Bers, (1990), Am. J. Physiol. 258, C282-8). Understanding the differences in affinity and structure between cTnCs from cold-adapted ectothermic species and mammals may bring new insights into how the different isoforms provide different resistances to cold. We followed the Ca(2+) titration to the regulatory domain of rainbow trout cTnC by NMR (wild type at 7 and 30 degrees C and F27W mutant at 30 degrees C) and fluorescence (F27W mutant, at 7 and 30 degrees C) spectroscopies. Using NMR spectroscopy, we detected Ca(2+) binding to site I of trout cTnC at high concentrations. This places trout cTnC between mammalian cTnC, in which site I is completely inactive, and skeletal TnC, in which site I binds Ca(2+) during muscle activation, and which is not as much affected by lower temperatures. This binding was seen both at 7 and at 30 degrees C. Despite the low Ca(2+) affinity, trout TnC site I may increase the likelihood of an opening of the regulatory domain, thus increasing the affinity for TnI. This way, it may be responsible for trout cTnC's capacity to function at lower temperatures.",M2
12731895,"Role of hydration in the closed-to-open transition involved in Ca2+ binding by troponin C.Troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) is the Ca(2+)-binding subunit of the troponin complex of vertebrate skeletal muscle. It consists of two structurally homologous domains, N and C, connected by an exposed alpha-helix. The C-domain has two high-affinity sites for Ca(2+) that also bind Mg(2+), whereas the N-domain has two low-affinity sites for Ca(2+). Previous studies using isolated N- and C-domains showed that the C-domain apo form was less stable than the N-domain. Here we analyzed the stability of isolated N-domain (F29W/N-domain) against urea and pressure denaturation in the absence and in the presence of glycerol using fluorescence spectroscopy. Increasing the glycerol concentration promoted an increase in the stability of the protein to urea (0-8 M) in the absence of Ca(2+). Furthermore, the ability to expose hydrophobic surfaces normally promoted by Ca(2+) binding or low temperature under pressure was partially lost in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol. Glycerol also led to a decrease in the Ca(2+) affinity of the N-domain in solution. From the ln K(obs) versus ln a(H)2(O), we obtained the number of water molecules (63.5 +/- 8.7) involved in the transition N &lt;=&gt;N:Ca(2) that corresponds to an increase in the exposed surface area of 571.5 +/- 78.3 A(2). In skinned fibers, the affinity for Ca(2+) was also reduced by glycerol, although the effect was much less pronounced than in solution. Our results demonstrate quantitatively that the stability of this protein and its affinity for Ca(2+) are critically dependent on protein hydration.",M2
12730342,"Thin filament activation and unloaded shortening velocity of rabbit skinned muscle fibres.The unloaded shortening velocity of skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibres is sensitive to [Ca2+]. To determine whether Ca2+ affects the unloaded shortening velocity via regulation of crossbridge kinetics or crossbridge number, the shortening velocity was measured following changes in either [Ca2+] or the number of active thin filament regulatory units. The native troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) was extracted and replaced with either cardiac TnC (cTnC) or a mixture of cTnC and an inactive mutant cardiac TnC (CBMII TnC). The unloaded shortening velocity of the cTnC-replaced fibres was determined at various values of [Ca2+] and compared with different cTnC:CBMII TnC ratios at a saturating [Ca2+]. If Ca2+ regulates the unloaded shortening velocity via kinetic modulation, differences in the velocity-tension relationship between the cTnC fibres and the cTnC:CBMII TnC fibres would be apparent. Alternatively, Ca2+ control of the number of active crossbridges would yield similar velocity-tension relationships when comparing the cTnC and cTnC:CBMII TnC fibres. The results show a decline in the unloaded shortening velocity that is determined by the relative tension, defined as the level of thin filament activation, rather than the [Ca2+]. Furthermore, at lower levels of relative tension, the reduction in unloaded shortening is not the result of changes in any cooperative effects of myosin on Ca2+ binding to the thin filament. Rather, it may be related to a decrease in crossbridge-induced activation of the thin filament at the level of the individual regulatory unit. In summary, the results suggest that Ca2+ regulates the unloaded shortening velocity in skinned fibres by reducing the number of crossbridges able to productively bind to the thin filament without affecting any inherent property of the myosin.",M2
12718873,"In situ orientations of protein domains: troponin C in skeletal muscle fibers.A recently developed approach for mapping protein-domain orientations in the cellular environment was used to investigate the Ca(2+)-dependent structural changes in the tropomyosin/troponin complex on the actin filament that regulate muscle contraction. Polarized fluorescence from bifunctional rhodamine probes attached along four alpha helices of troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) was measured in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers. In relaxed muscle, the N-terminal lobe of TnC is less closed than in crystal structures of the Ca(2+)-free domain, and its D helix is approximately perpendicular to the actin filament. In contrast to crystal structures of isolated TnC, the D and E helices are not collinear. On muscle activation, the N lobe orientation becomes more disordered and the average angle between the C helix and the filament changes by 32 degrees +/- 5 degrees. These results illustrate the potential of in situ measurements of helix and domain orientations for elucidating structure-function relations in native macromolecular complexes.",M2
12558500,"Troponin C in different insect muscle types: identification of two isoforms in Lethocerus, Drosophila and Anopheles that are specific to asynchronous flight muscle in the adult insect.The indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Lethocerus (giant water bug) and Drosophila (fruitfly) are asynchronous: oscillatory contractions are produced by periodic stretches in the presence of a Ca(2+) concentration that does not fully activate the muscle. The troponin complex on thin filaments regulates contraction in striated muscle. The complex in IFM has subunits that are specific to this muscle type, and stretch activation may act through troponin. Lethocerus and Drosophila have an unusual isoform of the Ca(2+)-binding subunit of troponin, troponin C (<e>TnC</e>), with a single Ca(2+)-binding site near the C-terminus (domain IV); this isoform is only in IFMs, together with a minor isoform with an additional Ca(2+)-binding site in the N-terminal region (domain II). Lethocerus has another TnC isoform in leg muscle which also has two Ca(2+)-binding sites. Ca(2+) binds more strongly to domain IV than to domain II in two-site isoforms. There are four isoforms in Drosophila and Anopheles (malarial mosquito), three of which are also in adult Lethocerus. A larval isoform has not been identified in Lethocerus. Different TnC isoforms are expressed in the embryonic, larval, pupal and adult stages of Drosophila; the expression of the two IFM isoforms is increased in the pupal stage. Immunoelectron microscopy shows the distribution of the major IFM isoform with one Ca(2+)-binding site is uniform along Lethocerus thin filaments. We suggest that initial activation of IFM is by Ca(2+) binding to troponin with the two-site TnC, and full activation is through the action of stretch on the complex with the one-site isoform.",M2
12557238,"Kinetic analysis of the interactions between troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and troponin I (TnI) binding peptides: evidence for separate binding sites for the 'structural' N-terminus and the 'regulatory' C-terminus of TnI on TnC.The Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent interactions between TnC and TnI play a critical role in regulating the 'on' and 'off' states of muscle contraction as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the troponin complex in the off state. In the present study, we have investigated the binding interactions between the N-terminus of TnI (residues 1-40 of skeletal TnI) and skeletal TnC in the presence of Ca(2+) ions, Mg(2+) ions and in the presence of the C-terminal regulatory region peptides: TnI(96-115), TnI(96-131) and TnI(96-139). Our results show the N-terminus of TnI can bind to TnC with high affinity in the presence of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) ions with apparent equilibrium dissociation constants of K(d(Ca(2+) ) ) = 48 nM and K(d(Mg(2+) ) ) = 29 nM. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants for the interactions were, k(on) = 4.8 x 10(5) M (-1) s(-1), 3.4 x 10(5) M (-1) s(-1) and k(off) = 2.3 x 10(-2) s(-1), 1.0 x 10(-2) s(-1) for TnC(Ca(2+)) and TnC(Mg(2+)) states, respectively. Competition studies between each of the TnI regions and TnC showed that both TnI regions can bind simultaneously to TnC while native gel electrophoresis and SEC confirmed the formation of stable ternary complexes between TnI(96-139) (or TnI(96-131)) and TnC-TnI(1-40). Further analysis of the binding interactions in the ternary complex showed the binding of the TnI regulatory region to TnC was critically dependent upon the presence of both TnC binding sites (i.e. TnI(96-115) and TnI(116-131)) and the presence of Ca(2+). Furthermore, the presence of TnI(1-40) slightly weakened the affinity of the regulatory peptides for TnC. Taken together, these results support the model for TnI-TnC interaction where the N-terminus of TnI remains bound to the C-domain of TnC in the presence of high and low Ca(2+) levels while the TnI regulatory region (residues 96-139) switches in its binding interactions between the actin-tropomyosin thin filament and its own sites on the N- and C-domain of TnC at high Ca(2+) levels, thus regulating muscle contraction.",M2
12531902,"Parallel measurement of Ca2+ binding and fluorescence emission upon Ca2+ titration of recombinant skeletal muscle troponin C. Measurement of sequential calcium binding to the regulatory sites.Calcium binding to chicken recombinant skeletal muscle <e>TnC</e> (TnC) and its mutants containing tryptophan (F29W), 5-hydroxytryptophan (F29HW), or 7-azatryptophan (F29ZW) at position 29 was measured by flow dialysis and by fluorescence. Comparative analysis of the results allowed us to determine the influence of each amino acid on the calcium binding properties of the N-terminal regulatory domain of the protein. Compared with TnC, the Ca(2+) affinity of N-terminal sites was: 1) increased 6-fold in F29W, 2) increased 3-fold in F29ZW, and 3) decreased slightly in F29HW. The Ca(2+) titration of F29ZW monitored by fluorescence displayed a bimodal curve related to sequential Ca(2+) binding to the two N-terminal Ca(2+) binding sites. Single and double mutants of TnC, F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW were constructed by replacing aspartate by alanine at position 30 (site I) or 66 (site II) or both. Ca(2+) binding data showed that the Asp --&gt; Ala mutation at position 30 impairs calcium binding to site I only, whereas the Asp --&gt; Ala mutation at position 66 impairs calcium binding to both sites I and II. Furthermore, the Asp --&gt; Ala mutation at position 30 eliminates the differences in Ca(2+) affinity observed for replacement of Phe at position 29 by Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, or 7-azatryptophan. We conclude that position 29 influences the affinity of site I and that Ca(2+) binding to site I is dependent on the previous binding of metal to site II.",M2
12531735,"Cross-bridge kinetics modeled from myoplasmic [Ca2+] and LV pressure at 17 degrees C and after 37 degrees C and 17 degrees C ischemia.We modeled changes in contractile element kinetics derived from the cyclic relationship between myoplasmic [Ca(2+)], measured by indo 1 fluorescence, and left ventricular pressure (LVP). We estimated model rate constants of the Ca(2+) affinity for troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) on actin (A) filament (TnCA) and actin and myosin (M) cross-bridge (A x M) cycling in intact guinea pig hearts during baseline 37 degrees C perfusion and evaluated changes at 1) 20 min 17 degrees C pressure, 2) 30-min reperfusion (RP) after 30-min 37 degrees C global ischemia during 37 degrees C RP, and 3) 30-min RP after 240-min 17 degrees C global ischemia during 37 degrees C RP. At 17 degrees C perfusion versus 37 degrees C perfusion, the model predicted: A x M binding was less sensitive; A x M dissociation was slower; Ca(2+) was less likely to bind to TnCA with A x M present; and Ca(2+) and TnCA binding was less sensitive in the absence of A x M. Model results were consistent with a cold-induced fall in heart rate from 260 beats/min (37 degrees C) to 33 beats/min (17 degrees C), increased diastolic LVP, and increased phasic Ca(2+). On RP after 37 degrees C ischemia vs. 37 degrees C perfusion, the model predicted the following: A x M binding was less sensitive; A x M dissociation was slower; and Ca(2+) was less likely to bind to TnCA in the absence of A. M. Model results were consistent with reduced myofilament responsiveness to [Ca(2+)] and diastolic contracture on 37 degrees C RP. In contrast, after cold ischemia versus 37 degrees C perfusion, A x M association and dissociation rates, and Ca(2+) and TnCA association rates, returned to preischemic values, whereas the dissociation rate of Ca(2+) from A x M was ninefold faster. This cardiac muscle kinetic model predicted a better-restored relationship between Ca(2+) and cross-bridge function on RP after an eightfold longer period of 17 degrees C than 37 degrees C ischemia.",M2
12501194,"The solution structure of a cardiac troponin C-troponin I-troponin T complex shows a somewhat compact troponin C interacting with an extended troponin I-troponin T component.We have investigated the structure of the cTnC-cTnI-cTnT(198-298) calcium-saturated, ternary cardiac troponin complex by small-angle scattering with contrast variation. Shape restoration was also applied to the scattering information resulting from the deuterated cTnC subunit, the unlabeled cTnI-cTnT(198-298) subunits, and the entire complex. The experimental results and modeling indicate that cTnC adopts a partially collapsed conformation, while the cTnI-cTnT(198-298) components have an extended, rod-like structure. Shape restoration applied to the X-ray scattering data and the entire contrast variation series suggest that cTnC and the cTnI-cTnT(198-298) component lie with their long axes roughly parallel to one another with a relatively small surface area for interaction. Our findings indicate that the nature of the interactions between <e>TnC</e> and the TnI-TnT component differs significantly between the cardiac and skeletal isoforms as evidenced by the different degrees of compactness between the cardiac TnC and skeletal TnC in their respective ternary complexes and the fact that the cTnC subunit is not highly intertwined with the other subunits, as observed in the binary complex of the skeletal isoforms [Olah, G.

12482894,"Determinants of relaxation rate in rabbit skinned skeletal muscle fibres.The influence of Ca(2+)-activated force, the rate of dissociation of Ca(2+) from troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and decreased crossbridge detachment rate on the time course of relaxation induced by flash photolysis of diazo-2 in rabbit skinned psoas fibres was investigated at 15 degrees C. The rate of relaxation increased as the diazo-2 chelating capacity (i.e. free [diazo-2]/free [Ca(2+)]) increased. At a constant diazo-2 chelating capacity, the rate of relaxation was independent of the pre-photolysis Ca(2+)-activated force in the range 0.3-0.8 of maximum isometric force. A TnC mutant that exhibited increased Ca(2+) sensitivity caused by a decreased Ca(2+) dissociation rate in solution (M82Q TnC) also increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of steady-state force and decreased the rate of relaxation in fibres by approximately twofold. In contrast, a TnC mutant with decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity caused by an increased Ca(2+) dissociation rate in solution (NHdel TnC) decreased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of steady-state force but did not accelerate relaxation. Decreasing the rate of crossbridge kinetics by reducing intracellular inorganic phosphate concentration ([P(i)]) slowed relaxation by approximately twofold and led to two phases of relaxation, a slow linear phase followed by a fast exponential phase. In fibres, M82Q TnC further slowed relaxation in low [P(i)] conditions by approximately twofold, whereas NHdel TnC had no significant effect on relaxation. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Ca(2+)-dissociation rate and crossbridge detachment rate are similar in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, such that decreasing either rate slows relaxation, but accelerating Ca(2+) dissociation has little effect on relaxation.",M2
12397067,"Engineering competitive magnesium binding into the first EF-hand of skeletal troponin C.The goal of this study was to examine the mechanism of magnesium binding to the regulatory domain of skeletal troponin C (<e>TnC</e>). The fluorescence of Trp(29), immediately preceding the first calcium-binding loop in TnC(F29W), was unchanged by addition of magnesium, but increased upon calcium binding with an affinity of 3.3 microm. However, the calcium-dependent increase in TnC(F29W) fluorescence could be reversed by addition of magnesium, with a calculated competitive magnesium affinity of 2.2 mm. When a Z acid pair was introduced into the first EF-hand of TnC(F29W), the fluorescence of G34DTnC(F29W) increased upon addition of magnesium or calcium with affinities of 295 and 1.9 microm, respectively. Addition of 3 mm magnesium decreased the calcium sensitivity of TnC(F29W) and G34DTnC(F29W) approximately 2- and 6-fold, respectively. Exchange of G34DTnC(F29W) into skinned psoas muscle fibers decreased fiber calcium sensitivity approximately 1.7-fold compared with TnC(F29W) at 1 mm [magnesium](free) and approximately 3.2-fold at 3 mm [magnesium](free). Thus, incorporation of a Z acid pair into the first EF-hand allows it to bind magnesium with high affinity. Furthermore, the data suggests that the second EF-hand, but not the first, of TnC is responsible for the competitive magnesium binding to the regulatory domain.",M2
12381325,"Kinetic analysis of the interactions between troponin C and the C-terminal troponin I regulatory region and validation of a new peptide delivery/capture system used for surface plasmon resonance.Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy, the apparent kinetic constants, k(on) and k(off), and equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), have been determined for the binding interaction between rabbit skeletal troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) and rabbit skeletal troponin I (TnI) regulatory region peptides: TnI(96-115), TnI(96-131) and TnI(96-139). To carry out SPR analysis, a new peptide delivery/capture system was utilized in which the TnI peptides were conjugated to the E-coil strand of a de novo designed heterodimeric coiled-coil domain. The TnI peptide conjugates were then captured via dimerization to the opposite strand (K-coil), which was immobilized on the biosensor surface. TnC was then injected over the biosensor surface for quantitative binding analysis. For fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, the environmentally sensitive fluoroprobe 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) was covalently linked to Cys98 of TnC and free TnI peptides were added. SPR analysis yielded equilibrium dissociation constants for TnC (plus Ca(2+)) binding to the C-terminal TnI regulatory peptides TnI(96-131) and TnI(96-139) of 89nM and 58nM, respectively. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants for each interaction were k(on)=2.3x10(5)M(-1)s(-1), 2.0x10(5)M(-1)s(-1) and k(off)=2.0x10(-2)s(-1), 1.2x10(-2)s(-1) for TnI(96-131) and TnI(96-139) peptides, respectively. These results were consistent with those obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy analysis: K(d) being equal to 130nM and 56nM for TnC-TnI(96-131) and TnC-TnI(96-139), respectively. Interestingly, although the inhibitory region peptide (TnI(96-115)) was observed to bind with an affinity similar to that of TnI(96-131) by fluorescence analysis (K(d)=380nM), its binding was not detected by SPR. Subsequent investigations examining salt effects suggested that the binding mechanism for the inhibitory region peptide is best characterized by an electrostatically driven fast on-rate ( approximately 1x10(8) to 1x10(9)M(-1)s(-1)) and a fast off-rate ( approximately 1x10(2)s(-1)). Taken together, the determination of these kinetic rate constants permits a clearer view of the interactions between the TnC and TnI proteins of the troponin complex.",M2
12379133,"Cross-linking between the regulatory regions of troponin-I and troponin-C abolishes the inhibitory function of troponin.We reported previously that both residues 48 and 82 on opposite sides of troponin-C's (<e>TnC</e>'s) N-terminal regulatory hydrophobic cleft photo-cross-linked to Met121 of troponin-I (TnI) [Luo, Y., Leszyk, J., Qian, Y., Gergely, J., and Tao, T. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 6678-6688]. Here we report that the Ca2+-absent inhibitory activity of troponin (Tn) was progressively lost as the extent of photo-cross-linking increased. To extend these studies, we constructed a mutant TnI with a single cysteine at residue 121 (TnI121). In Tn complexes containing TnI121 and mutant TnCs with a single cysteine at positions 12, 48, 82, 98, or 125 (TnC12, TnC48 etc.), TnI121 formed disulfide cross-links primarily with TnC48 and TnC82 when Ca2+ was present, and with only TnC48 when Ca2+ was absent. These results indicate that TnI Met121 is situated within the N-domain hydrophobic cleft of TnC in the presence of Ca2+, and that it moves out of the cleft upon Ca2+ removal but remains within the vicinity of TnC. Activity assays revealed that the Met121 to Cys mutation in TnI121 reduced the Ca2+-present activation of Tn, indicating that Met121 is important in hydrophobic interactions between this TnI region and TnC's N-domain cleft. The formation of a disulfide cross-link between TnI121 and TnC48 or TnC82 abolished the Ca2+-absent inhibitory activity of Tn, indicating that the movement of the Met121 region of TnI out of TnC's N-domain cleft is essential for the occurrence of further events in the inhibitory process of skeletal muscle contraction. On the basis of these and other results, a simple mechanism for Ca2+ regulation of skeletal muscle contraction is presented and discussed.",M2
12367529,"Activation of striated muscle: nearest-neighbor regulatory-unit and cross-bridge influence on myofilament kinetics.We have formulated a three-compartment model of muscle activation that includes both strong cross-bridge (XB) and Ca(2+)-activated regulatory-unit (RU) mediated nearest-neighbor cooperative influences. The model is based on the tight coupling premise--that XB retain activating Ca(2+) on the thin filament. Using global non-linear least-squares, the model produced excellent fits to experimental steady-state force-pCa and ATPase-pCa data from skinned rat soleus fibers. In terms of the model, nearest-neighbor influences over the range of Ca(2+) required for activation cause the Ca(2+) dissociation rate from regulatory-units (k(off)) to decrease and the cross-bridge association rate (f) to increase each more than ten-fold. Moreover, the rate variations occur in separate Ca(2+) regimes. The energy of activation governing f is strongly influenced by both neighboring RU and XB. In contrast, the energy of activation governing k(off) is less affected by neighboring XB than by neighboring RU. Nearest-neighbor cooperative influences provide both an overall sensitization to Ca(2+) and the well-known steep response of force to free Ca(2+). The apparent sensitivity for Ca(2+)-activation of force and ATPase is a function of cross-bridge kinetic rates. The model and derived parameter set produce simulated behavior in qualitative agreement with steady-state experiments reported in the literature for partial <e>TnC</e> replacement, increased [P(i)], increased [ADP], and MalNEt-S1 addition. The model is an initial attempt to construct a general theory of striated muscle activation-one that can be consistently used to interpret data from various types of muscle manipulation experiments.",M2
12207022,"Structural consequences of cardiac troponin I phosphorylation.beta-Adrenergic stimulation of the heart results in bisphosphorylation of the N-terminal extension of cardiac troponin I (TnI). Bisphosphorylation of TnI reduces the affinity of the regulatory site on troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) for Ca(2+) by increasing the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation. What remains unclear is how the phosphorylation signal is transmitted from one subunit of troponin to another. We have produced a series of mutations in the N-terminal extension of TnI designed to further our understanding of the mechanisms involved. The ability of phosphorylation of the mutant TnIs to affect Ca(2+) sensitivity has been assessed. We find that the Pro residues found in a conserved (Xaa-Pro)(4) motif N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites are not required for the effect of the N-terminal extension on Ca(2+) binding in the presence or absence of phosphorylation. Our experiments also reveal that the full effects of phosphorylation are seen even when residues 1-15 of TnI are deleted. If further residues are removed, not only does the effect of phosphorylation diminish but deletion of the N-terminal extension mimics phosphorylation. We propose that TnI residues 16-29 bind to TnC stabilizing the  open  Ca(2+)-bound state. Phosphorylation (or deletion) prevents this binding, accelerating Ca(2+) release.",M2
12147696,"Solution structure of calcium-saturated cardiac troponin C bound to cardiac troponin I.Cardiac troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) is composed of two globular domains connected by a flexible linker. In solution, linker flexibility results in an ill defined orientation of the two globular domains relative to one another. We have previously shown a decrease in linker flexibility in response to cardiac troponin I (cTnI) binding. To investigate the relative orientation of calcium-saturated TnC domains when bound to cTnI, (1)H-(15)N residual dipolar couplings were measured in two different alignment media. Similarity in alignment tensor orientation for the two TnC domains supports restriction of domain motion in the presence of cTnI. The relative spatial orientation of TnC domains bound to TnI was calculated from measured residual dipolar couplings and long-range distance restraints utilizing a rigid body molecular dynamics protocol. The relative domain orientation is such that hydrophobic pockets face each other, forming a latch to constrain separate helical segments of TnI. We have utilized this structure to successfully explain the observed functional consequences of linker region deletion mutants. Together, these studies suggest that, although linker plasticity is important, the ability of TnC to function in muscle contraction can be correlated with a preferred domain orientation and interdomain distance.",M2
12135750,"Mechano-chemical effects of Ca(2+) in cross-linked troponin-C films.Changes in troponin C (<e>TnC</e>) conformation upon Ca(2+) binding forms the basis for regulatory and structural functions of TnC molecules. In the present study, Ca(2+)-induced conformational changes in TnC were observed by mechanical measurements. TnC films were prepared by drying or electrospraying TnC solutions, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and isometric tension and stiffness measured as a function of pCa. An increase in Ca(2+) from a pCa of 9 to 4 induced large-scale mechanical changes in the TnC films causing several percent shrinkage of the unloaded films. This shrinkage could be partially assigned to Ca(2+) binding to the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) sites of TnC.",M2
