20509902,"Infrequent detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii by PCR in oral wash specimens from TB patients with or without HIV and healthy contacts in Tanzania.BACKGROUND: In tuberculosis (TB) endemic parts of the world, patients with pulmonary symptoms are managed as  smear-negative TB patients  if they do not improve on a two-week presumptive, broad-spectrum course of antibiotic treatment even if they are TB microscopy smear negative. These patients are frequently HIV positive and have a higher mortality than smear-positive TB patients. Lack of access to diagnose Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia might be a contributing reason. We therefore assessed the prevalence of P. jirovecii by PCR in oral wash specimens among TB patients and healthy individuals in an HIV- and TB-endemic area of sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A prospective study of 384 patients initiating treatment for sputum smear-positive and smear-negative TB and 100 healthy household contacts and neighbourhood controls. DNA from oral wash specimens was examined by PCR for P. jirovecii. All patients delivered sputum for TB microscopy and culture. Healthy contacts and community controls were clinically assessed and all study subjects were HIV tested and had CD4 cell counts determined. Clinical status and mortality was assessed after a follow-up period of 5 months. RESULTS: 384 patients and 100 controls were included, 53% and 8% HIV positive respectively. A total number of 65 patients and controls (13.6%) were at definitive risk for <e>PCP</e> based on CD4 counts &lt;200 cells per mm3 and no specific PCP prophylaxis. Only a single patient (0.3% of the patients) was PCR positive for P. jirovecii. None of the healthy household contacts or neighbourhood controls had PCR-detectable P. jirovecii DNA in their oral wash specimens regardless of HIV-status. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of P. jirovecii as detected by PCR on oral wash specimens was very low among TB patients with or without HIV and healthy individuals in Tanzania. Colonisation by P. jirovecii was not detected among healthy controls. The present findings may encourage diagnostic use of this non-invasive method.",M1
20378904,"Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive marker of inflammation and tissue damage. We aimed to describe CRP responses in HIV-infected patients presenting with Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>), bacterial pneumonia (BP) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and, in patients with PCP, to identify if elevated CRP has prognostic significance. Data obtained by case-note review of consecutive HIV-infected adults with acute respiratory episodes included admission CRP (elevated &gt;5 mg/L), haemoglobin, white blood count, CD4 count and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO(2)), presence of pulmonary co-pathology/intercurrent infection and outcome (survival). Median (range) CRP in patients with BP = 120 mg/L (&lt;5-620 mg/L), TB = 44 mg/L (&lt;5-256.3 mg/L) and PCP = 35 mg/L (&lt;5-254 mg/L). CRP was elevated in 93/103 (90.3%) patients with PCP; six patients died; and all had an elevated CRP. PaO(2) and CRP values were associated as follows: average CRP levels declined by 10% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20%) per kPa increase in PaO(2) = 0.002. Factors associated with death were higher CRP, odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 5.30 (1.61 to 17.51) per 100 mg/L increase, P = 0.006 and haemoglobin, OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.29 to 0.93) per g/dL, P = 0.033. CRP is elevated in the majority of HIV-infected patients with PCP, BP and TB. Admission CRP measurement lacks specificity, but in PCP elevations of CRP are associated with disease severity (PaO(2)) and poor outcome and might be used prognostically, together with other mortality risk factors; further prospective evaluation is needed.",M1
20194450,"A survey of rheumatologists' practice for prescribing pneumocystis prophylaxis.OBJECTIVE: Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) occurs in immunocompromised hosts, in both the presence and absence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with substantial morbidity and a heightened mortality. We assessed practice patterns among rheumatologists for prescribing PCP prophylaxis. METHODS: Invitations to an online international survey were e-mailed to 3150 consecutive members of the American College of Rheumatology. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 727 (23.1%) members. Among respondents, 505 (69.5%) reported prescribing prophylaxis. Factors associated with significantly higher frequency of prescribing PCP prophylaxis included female gender (OR 1.47, p = 0.03), US-based (OR 1.77, p = 0.004), academic-based (OR 2.75, p &lt; 0.001), in practice less than 10 years (OR 4.08, p &lt; 0.001), having previously treated PCP (OR 2.62, p &lt; 0.001), and in a practice with a higher proportion of patients maintained on chronic glucocorticoids (OR 2.04, p &lt; 0.001) or other immunosuppressant medications (OR 3.19, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, rheumatologists early in their careers and those with academic and US-based practices were more likely to prescribe prophylaxis. Among prescribers, the most important determinants for issuing prophylaxis were treatment regimen (68.6%), rheumatologic diagnosis (9.3%), and medication dosage (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third (30%) of the rheumatologists surveyed reported that they never prescribed PCP prophylaxis. While the patient characteristics for which prophylaxis was prescribed varied widely, physician demographics were strongly predictive of PCP prophylaxis use. These findings suggest that development of consensus guidelines might influence clinical decision-making regarding PCP prophylaxis in HIV-negative patients with rheumatologic diagnoses.",M1
20173272,"Racial variations in care and outcomes for inpatient HIV-related pneumocystis pneumonia.Racial disparities in HIV-care include the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on African Americans. We conducted a retrospective review of 1,855 cases at 78 hospitals in nine cities to evaluate racial variations in inpatient care for AIDS-related Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) shortly after the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapies. While inpatient HIV-related PCP mortality was comparable between Whites and Hispanics (p=0.94), African Americans were less likely than Whites to die in-hospital (AOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48, 0.99) and more likely to receive timely anti-PCP medications (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21, 2.30) and timely corticosteroids (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17, 1.82). Findings were compared with those from our study involving 1,547 patients at 82 hospitals in five cities over the first decade of the AIDS epidemic. In contrast to the first study, in the second decade African Americans were more likely to receive timely and appropriate therapy for HIV-related PCP, and resultantly were more likely to survive the hospitalization.",M1
20154431,"Comparison of clinical and radiological features of pneumocystis pneumonia between malignancy cases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The clinical features of pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) differ according to the predisposing factors responsible for immunosuppression. Although PCP in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been extensively described, its characteristics in non-AIDS patients, such as those with malignancies, are not thoroughly documented. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare the clinical and imaging features of PCP in patients with malignancies with those in AIDS patients. DESIGN: A multi-center retrospective study. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated the clinical and radiological features of PCP in 21 patients with malignancies and in 17 with AIDS. Clinical presentation, serum markers, oxygenation, CT findings, and outcome were examined. RESULTS: The patients with malignancies showed shorter durations of symptoms before PCP was diagnosed. The levels of serum markers and the oxygenation index did not differ. CT showed diffuse or widespread ground-glass opacity (GGO) in all of the patients evaluated. None of the AIDS patients demonstrated consolidation, whereas half of the patients with malignancy showed consolidation along with GGO. The extent of GGO scored on CT images was significantly greater in the AIDS patients. No correlation was observed between the CT findings and other clinical parameters. All of the AIDS patients recovered from PCP, whereas six patients with malignancies died within a month after the onset of PCP. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the CT images differed between the patient groups with different underlying disorders, although it remains to be determined whether CT findings are associated with other clinical features or are predictive of the outcome of PCP.",M1
20126455,"Echinocandin treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia in rodent models depletes cysts leaving trophic burdens that cannot transmit the infection.Fungi in the genus Pneumocystis cause pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in hosts with debilitated immune systems and are emerging as co-morbidity factors associated with chronic diseases such as COPD. Limited therapeutic choices and poor understanding of the life cycle are a result of the inability of these fungi to grow outside the mammalian lung. Within the alveolar lumen, Pneumocystis spp., appear to have a bi-phasic life cycle consisting of an asexual phase characterized by binary fission of trophic forms and a sexual cycle resulting in formation of cysts, but the life cycle stage that transmits the infection is not known. The cysts, but not the trophic forms, express beta -1,3-D-glucan synthetase and contain abundant beta -1,3-D-glucan. Here we show that therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of PCP with echinocandins, compounds which inhibit the synthesis of beta -1,3-D-glucan, depleted cysts in rodent models of PCP, while sparing the trophic forms which remained in significant numbers. Survival was enhanced in the echincandin treated mice, likely due to the decreased beta -1,3-D-glucan content in the lungs of treated mice and rats which coincided with reductions of cyst numbers, and dramatic remodeling of organism morphology. Strong evidence for the cyst as the agent of transmission was provided by the failure of anidulafungin-treated mice to transmit the infection. We show for the first time that withdrawal of anidulafungin treatment with continued immunosuppression permitted the repopulation of cyst forms. Treatment of PCP with an echinocandin alone will not likely result in eradication of infection and cessation of echinocandin treatment while the patient remains immunosuppressed could result in relapse. Importantly, the echinocandins provide novel and powerful chemical tools to probe the still poorly understood bi-phasic life cycle of this genus of fungal pathogens.",M1
20113271,"Imaging characteristics of pneumocystis pneumonia after renal transplantation.Identification of Pneumocysis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) after renal transplantation has a great impact on early diagnosis and therapy, which could decrease its mortality. Due to a lack of characteristic clinical symptoms, imaging modalities became very important in the diagnosing PCP. Thirteen PCP patients after renal transplantation were reviewed. They underwent a series of chest radiographs and chest high-resolution CT scans. The common radiological presentations were bilateral diffuse symmetrical ground-glass and consolidation opacities, followed by pneumoceles or air-filled cysts or linear or reticular shadows. Ground-glass attenuations were showed clearly on HRCT in 13 patients, while only 6 on CXR. Pneumoceles or cysts (n = 8) were seen only on HRCT. Air-filled cysts or pneumoceles within bilateral diffuse symmetrical ground-glass and consolidation opacities may be the characteristic of this disease. If combined with clinical data, the diagnosis of PCP could be established.",M1
20049469,"Radiological features of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with and without AIDS.The aim of this study was to compare chest computerized tomography (CT) findings of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in immunocompromised patients with and without acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Chest CT findings and clinical parameters of 38 consecutive immunocompromised patients, nine with AIDS and 29 with other causes of immunosuppression, were characterized and compared. PCP in patients without AIDS was diagnosed after a significantly shorter time interval from symptom onset: 8 +/- 6 vs. 18 +/- 1.0 days (p = 0.024). From a radiographic point of view, non-AIDS patients had a significantly higher proportion of diffuse ground glass lesions, 86 vs. 44% (p = 0.02), and a lower proportion of cystic lesions, 3 vs. 56% (p = 0.015). The two subgroups did not differ in smoking status and the number of pack-years. On multivariant analysis, only the presence of AIDS was found to be a risk factor for the formation of pulmonary cystic lesions. Different immune reactions to the parasite P. jirovecii in immunocompromised patients with and without AIDS results in a different time lag between symptoms and a correspondingly different radiographic pattern: widespread ground glass opacities in the former and cystic lesions in the latter.",M1
20020829,"Current understanding of Pneumocystis immunology.Pneumocystis jirovecii is the opportunistic fungal organism that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in humans. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, Pneumocystis causes disease in individuals who are immunocompromised, particularly those infected with HIV. PCP remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Incidence has decreased greatly with the advent of HAART. However, an increase in the non-HIV immunocompromised population, noncompliance with current treatments, emergence of drug-resistant strains and rise in HIV(+) cases in developing countries makes Pneumocystis a pathogen of continued interest and a public health threat. A great deal of research interest has addressed therapeutic interventions to boost waning immunity in the host to prevent or treat PCP. This article focuses on research conducted during the previous 5 years regarding the host immune response to Pneumocystis, including innate, cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and associated immunotherapies tested against PCP.",M1
19949093,"Anti-CD3 antibody decreases inflammation and improves outcome in a murine model of Pneumocystis pneumonia.The T cell-mediated immune response elicited by Pneumocystis plays a key role in pulmonary damage and dysfunction during Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (<e>PcP</e>). Mice depleted of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells prior to infection are markedly protected from PcP-related respiratory deficit and death, despite progressive lung infection. However, the therapeutic effectiveness of Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function in mice already displaying clinical symptoms of disease has not been determined. Therefore, a murine model of PcP-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was used to assess whether Ab to the pan-T cell molecule CD3 is effective for reducing the severity of PcP when administered after the onset of disease. Mice that received anti-CD3 Ab exhibited a rapid and dramatic halt in the PcP-associated pulmonary function decline within 1 week after treatment, and a striking enhancement of survival rate compared with mice receiving the control Ab. Physiologic improvement in anti-CD3 treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells recovered in lung lavage fluid. This effectiveness of anti-CD3 was noted whether the mice also received antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These data suggest that monoclonal Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function may represent a specific and effective adjunctive therapy to rapidly reverse the ongoing pathologic immune response occurring during active PcP. Thus, the anti-human CD3 monoclonal Ab OKT3, which is already in clinical use, has the potential to be developed as an adjunctive therapy for PcP.",M1
19947989,"Differences in the clinical characteristics of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromized patients with and without HIV infection.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in patients with predisposing immunodeficiencies other than AIDS is growing. Knowing the different characteristics and outcomes of PCP according to HIV status would help physicians manage and treat patients with PCP. METHODS: The medical charts of all patients with a proven first episode of PCP, diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed, and clinical and laboratory data abstracted. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients with PCP, 18 were HIV-positive and 17 were HIV-negative with other immunosuppressive conditions. HIV-negative patients were significantly older than HIV-positive patients. The WCC (10 952 +/- 5669 vs 9750 +/- 3133/microL; P = 0.015), neutrophil counts (9631 +/- 5421 vs 5680 +/- 2628/microL; P = 0.01) and CD4+ lymphocyte counts (329 +/- 502 vs 47 +/- 50/microL; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in HIV-negative patients. Six of the 17 HIV-negative patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt;300/microL. Serum IgG levels were lower in HIV-negative patients (943 +/- 379 vs 1635 +/- 657 mg/dL; P = 0.017). Mortality was higher in HIV-negative (52.9%) than in HIV-positive patients (0%). On univariate analysis, risk factors for mortality from PCP were the presence of underlying pulmonary disease (odds ratio 4.000, 95% CI: 1.501-10.658) and HIV-negative status (odds ratio 2.125, 95% CI: 1.283-3.518). CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics and outcomes of PCP differ significantly depending on HIV status. The existence of underlying pulmonary diseases may be associated with the prognosis of HIV-negative patients with PCP.",M1
19922070,"Good outcome with trimethoprim 10 mg/kg/day-sulfamethoxazole 50 mg/kg/day for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV infected patients.Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is usually treated with trimethoprim (TMP)-sulfamethoxazole (SMX) 1920 mg 3 times daily (approximately equivalent to TMP 15 mg/kg/day-SMX 75 mg/kg/day) for 21 days. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that lower doses would be equally efficacious and might be associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects. We conducted a retrospective review of case notes for the first episode of laboratory-confirmed PCP in HIV-infected patients treated at Auckland City Hospital, from January 1991 through December 2007. Seventy-three of 84 (87%) patients were treated with TMP-SMX 960 mg 4 times daily or 3 times daily (approximately TMP 10 mg/kg/day-SMX 50 mg/kg/day). The overall mortality was 5/73 (7%). The mortality in patients with severe disease (transcutaneous oxygen saturation on admission &lt; or =84%) was 3/16 (19%) and in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 5/9 (56%). Fifteen of 73 (21%) patients required a change to an alternative treatment regimen because of adverse effects (rash in 10, rash plus fever in 3, neutropenia in 1, fever plus headache in 1). Treatment of PCP in adult HIV-infected patients with TMP-SMX 960 mg QID or TID appears to have comparable efficacy to treatment with higher doses and to be associated with a lower rate of treatment limiting adverse effects.",M1
19879509,"Pneumocystis pneumonia in children.Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised children with quantitative and qualitative defects in T lymphocytes. At risk are children with lymphoid malignancies, HIV infection, corticosteroid therapy, transplantation and primary immunodeficiency states. Diagnosis is established through direct examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from respiratory secretions. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole is used for initial therapy in most patients, while pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin plus primaquine, and dapsone plus trimethoprim are alternatives. Prophylaxis of high-risk patients reduces but does not eliminate the risk of PCP.

Few data exist to guide the choice of second-line therapy for patients failing or developing toxicity to first-line therapy. METHODS: A case note review of 1122 patients with 1188 episodes of HIV-associated PCP from three observational cohorts in Copenhagen, London and Milan, between 1989 and 2004, was conducted. RESULTS: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (962 PCP episodes, 81%) was the most frequently used first-line therapy, followed by intravenous pentamidine (87 episodes, 7%), clindamycin/primaquine (72 episodes, 6%) and 'other' (atovaquone, dapsone/pyrimethamine, trimetrexate or inhaled pentamidine; 67 episodes, 6%). Rates of unchanged therapy were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 79%, clindamycin/primaquine = 65% and pentamidine = 60% (P &lt; 0.001). First-line therapy was changed because of failure in 82 (7%) episodes and because of toxicity in 198 (17%) episodes. Three month survival rates were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 85%, clindamycin/primaquine = 81% and pentamidine = 76% (P = 0.09). After adjustment for possible confounders, pentamidine was associated with a significantly greater risk of death at 3 months [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.4]. Second-line therapy survival rates differed: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 85%; clindamycin/primaquine = 87%; and pentamidine = 60% (P = 0.01). Multivariable time-updated Cox regression analysis showed a greater risk of death associated with pentamidine (HR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.2-5.0), but not for clindamycin/primaquine, when both were compared with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Pentamidine was associated with a greater risk of death when used as first- and second-line therapy for HIV-associated PCP, and was associated with more treatment changes. Clindamycin/primaquine appeared superior to pentamidine as second-line therapy for PCP in patients failing or developing toxicity with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In patients failing first-line treatment with non-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole regimens, second-line therapy should be trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.",M1

Among 91 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as a first-line treatment for PCP, 31 (34%) did not respond and 7 (8%) had adverse reactions. Fourteen patients received C-P and 9 received pentamidine as a second-line regimen because of treatment failure or an adverse reaction to TMP-SMX.

Data describing use of PCP prophylaxis in immunosuppressed dermatologic patients are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the frequency of PCP among dermatologic patients receiving immunosuppression for immunobullous disease or connective tissue disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients with immunobullous and connective tissue disease at our department of dermatology between 1980 and 2006 who received immunosuppression and had subsequent development of pneumonia. We recorded patient characteristics, use of PCP prophylaxis, whether PCP developed, and if so, their morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of 334 patients identified, 7 (2.1%) were given the diagnosis of PCP during immunosuppressive treatment. Of these 7 patients, 3 (43%) died within 1 month of diagnosis, and none received PCP prophylaxis. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design and limited patient group are limitations.

19825785,"Predicting mortality from HIV-associated Pneumocystis pneumonia at illness presentation: an observational cohort study.BACKGROUND: Although the use of antiretroviral therapy has led to dramatic declines in AIDS-associated mortality, Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) remains a leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients. OBJECTIVES: To measure mortality, identify predictors of mortality at time of illness presentation and derive a PCP mortality prediction rule that stratifies patients by risk for mortality. METHODS: An observational cohort study with case note review of all HIV-infected persons with a laboratory diagnosis of PCP at San Francisco General Hospital from 1997 to 2006. RESULTS: 451 patients were diagnosed with PCP on 524 occasions. In-hospital mortality was 10.3%. Multivariate analysis identified five significant predictors of mortality: age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) per 10-year increase, 1.69; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.65; p = 0.02); recent injection drug use (AOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.28 to 6.42; p = 0.01); total bilirubin &gt;0.6 mg/dl (AOR 2.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 5.62; p = 0.02); serum albumin &lt;3 g/dl (AOR 3.63; 95% CI 1.72-7.66; p = 0.001); and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient &gt;or=50 mm Hg (AOR 3.02; 95% CI 1.41 to 6.47; p = 0.004). Using these five predictors, a six-point PCP mortality prediction rule was derived that stratifies patients according to increasing risk of mortality: score 0-1, 4%; score 2-3, 12%; score 4-5, 48%. CONCLUSIONS: The PCP mortality prediction rule stratifies patients by mortality risk at the time of illness presentation and should be validated as a clinical tool.",M1
19805570,"Polyamine transport as a target for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia.Polyamine levels are greatly increased in alveolar macrophages (AMs) during Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>), leading to increased production of H(2)O(2), which causes AMs to undergo apoptosis. One of the mechanisms by which polyamine levels in AMs are elevated is enhanced uptake of exogenous polyamines. In this study, the possibility of targeting polyamine uptake as a treatment for PCP was examined. Four anthracene- and one benzene-polyamine conjugates that are potential polyamine transport inhibitors, including N1-anthracen-9-ylmethyl-butane-1,4-diamine; N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-anthracen-9-ylmethylbutane-1,4-diamine; N-[4-(4-aminobutylamino)butyl]-N-anthracen-9-ylmethylbutane-1,4-diamine; N-(4-amino-butyl)-N'-(10-[[4-(4-amino-butylamino)butylamino]-methyl]anthracen-9-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine (44-Ant-44); and benzene-polyamine conjugate N-(4-amino-butyl)-N'-(4-[[4-(4-amino-butylamino)butylamino]-methyl]benzyl)butane-1,4-diamine (44-Bn-44), were tested. Compounds 44-Ant-44 and 44-Bn-44 were found to have a very low toxicity to AMs in vitro and were evaluated for their therapeutic effect on PCP in vivo. Sprague-Dawley rats infected with P. carinii for 28 days were intranasally instilled with 50 microl of a 1 mM solution of 44-Bn-44 or 44-Ant-44 every 2 days. Twenty-one days after initiation of the treatment, three to five rats from each group were sacrificed and examined for lung pathology, organism burden, and apoptosis of AMs. Both 44-Bn-44 and 44-Ant-44 reduced organism burdens; however, only 44-Ant-44 decreased the severity of the infection with reduced lung inflammation, increased clearance of exudates, increased air space, and decreased apoptosis of AMs. 44-Ant-44 also significantly prolonged the survival of treated animals. These results suggest that polyamine uptake is a potential target for treatment of PCP.",M1

19795979,"Restriction fragment length polymorphism typing demonstrates substantial diversity among Pneumocystis jirovecii isolates.Better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission patterns of human Pneumocystis should lead to improved strategies for preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). We have developed a typing method for Pneumocystis jirovecii that is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis after polymerase chain reaction amplification of an approximately 1300 base-pair region of the msg gene family, which comprises an estimated 50-100 genes/genome. The RFLP pattern was reproducible in samples containing &gt;1000 msg copies/reaction and was stable over time, based on analysis of serial samples from the same patient. In our initial analysis of 48 samples, we found that samples obtained from different individuals showed distinct banding patterns; only samples obtained from the same patient showed an identical RFLP pattern. Despite this substantial diversity, samples tended to cluster on the basis of country of origin. In an evaluation of samples obtained from an outbreak of PCP in kidney transplant recipients in Germany, RFLP analysis demonstrated identical patterns in samples that were from 12 patients previously linked to this outbreak, as well as from 2 additional patients. Our results highlight the presence of a remarkable diversity in human Pneumocystis strains. RFLP may be very useful for studying clusters of PCP in immunosuppressed patients, to determine whether there is a common source of infection.",M1

Nine weeks later they were sacrificed, and cytokines in BALF and lung histopathology were compared between them. Cyst burden was greater in GKO than in WT nude mice. Histopathology in the lung was severer and granulomatous lesions were observed more frequently in GKO nude mice. Levels of IL-17 were higher in BALF of GKO than in that of WT nude mice. Greater number of CD4(+) T cells from lungs of infected GKO nude mice produced IL-17 than those from WT ones. These results suggest that deficiency in IFN-gamma induces the differentiation of Th17 and that IL-17 is responsible for inflammatory response in PCP.",M1
19731525,"[An epidemiologic study on Pneumocystis pneumonia in non-HIV infected patients in China]OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiologic features of Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) among non-HIV infected patients in China. METHODS: Sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens obtained from 851 pneumonia patients without HIV infection from Jan. 2006 to Oct. 2008 were detected, using PCR and Gomori' s methenamine silver (UMS) stain for Pneumocystis jirovecii. RESULTS: Of the 615 sputum specimens, P. jirovecii positive rates of PCR and GMS stain were 20.3% and 10.2% respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Of 236 BALF specimens, P. jirovecii positive rates of PCR and GMS stain were 32.6% and 25.5% respectively (P &gt; 0.05). Of the total 851 pneumonia cases, 123 (14.5%) were GMS positive for P. jirovecii cyst and 202 cases (23.7%) were PCR positive for P. jirovecii DNA. In those immuno-suppressed patient group including patients with connective tissue diseases, organ transplant recipients, nephrotic, hematologic diseases and malignant tumor, P. jirovecii positive rate appeared the highest, 28.2% for GMS stain and 39.4% for PCR. There were also PCP patients in the immuno-competent pneumonia patient groups including senile patients with chronic diseases and patients without clear predisposing immuno-deficiencies. The positive rates of P. jirovecii GMS were 8.7% and 10.9%, respectively and 17.5% and 19.6% for P. jirovecii under PCR. CONCLUSION: PCR assay seemed sensitive for the detection of P. jirovecii in the sputum specimens and could be used for screening PCP patients without HIV infection. Our data showed that there was high risk of PCP in non-HIV infected patients in China.",M1

The breakdown of 20 patients was rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 5 cases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 5, dermatomyositis (DM) in 2, systemic scleroderma (SSc) in 1, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) in 1, Sjögren syndrome (SjS) in 1, polyarteritis nodosa (PN) in 3, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in 1, Schönlein-Henoch purpura in 1. Patients having interstitial pneumonia (IP) or renal dysfunction before acquiring PCP showed poor prognosis. High level of beta-D glucan was observed in all patients, and elevated levels of LDH and KL-6 were also characteristic of PCP. For the treatment of their own collagen diseases, high dose steroids had been given in 11 patients (55%), and immunosuppressive agents in 12 (60%), resulting in severe suppression of immune function in these patients. They were treated with Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) after Pneumocystis infection, however, 10 patients died and 8 of them died of respiratory failure in spite of high dose steroids. Nine patients fulfilled the criteria for PCP protective therapy provided by Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare, and 7 of them died of respiratory failure. The frequency of PCP remarkably decreased in our hospital after we had started the protective therapy with ST using the criteria, suggesting that it is effective for the protection of PCP.

19667941,"Outbreak of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in renal transplant recipients: P. jiroveci is contagious to the susceptible host.BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is only recommended during some periods after renal transplantation. Recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy have considerably reduced acute rejection. However, the reported PCP outbreaks are increasing in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Only three sporadic PCP cases had occurred since 1976 in our Renal Transplant Unit until the index case in July 2004. A PCP outbreak of 27 cases occurred mainly in the outpatient clinic within 1 year, followed by six additional cases during the next 3 years. Molecular analysis of P. jiroveci and surveys of reservoir were performed. RESULTS: Molecular analysis documented that all cases were caused by the same strain. Among 27 cases of the outbreak, human-to-human transmissions were traceable in 22 cases based on dates of outpatient clinic visits and in four cases during hospitalization. Based on the confirmed cases, airborne transmission was suspected with an estimated median PCP incubation period of 53 days (range 7-188 days). Surveys for reservoir of P. jiroveci identified asymptomatic carriers and environmental contamination. Some sporadic cases might be caused by reservoirs. Among the 33 cases, none had received PCP prophylaxis, 22 cases had PCP over 12 months, and six cases over 10 years after renal transplantation. CONCLUSION: On documentation of a PCP case, we recommend PCP prophylaxis for a maximum period of 6 months (upper limit of incubation period) in all renal transplant recipients including those on regular maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.",M1

19601796,"Preclinical drug discovery for new anti-pneumocystis compounds.Pneumocystis remains an important cause of fatal pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in HIV patients and other immunocompromised hosts. Preclinical drug discovery for agents active against PCP has been hindered in large part by the lack of a continuous in vitro growth system. Since approval in 1978, the combination of the folic acid synthesis inhibitor combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the primary agent for prophylaxis and therapy. Short term in vitro assays using cell monolayer-based and cell free systems in combination with in vivo studies in rodent models of infection have been the mainstay of candidate screening methods. These systems and their applications are reviewed here. Most strategies have focused on testing compounds already in clinical use, such as dapsone or atovaquone, for activity against Pneumocystis alone or in combination, and as parent compounds for chemical derivation, such as pentamidine and its analogues. Other successes from the bench include primaquine-clindamycin for moderate pneumonia and the family of Beta-glucan synthase inhibitors, which hold promise for clinical use against PCP. Despite the significant obstacles for drug discovery, progress in identifying novel agents has been made with current systems and the promise of future new targets is expected with the annotation of the Pneumocystis genome.",M1
19584693,"Analysis of USRDS: incidence and risk factors for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of modern immunosuppression on the incidence, risk factors, morbidity, and mortality of Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in recipients of kidney transplants. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32,757 Medicare primary transplant recipients in the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2004. PCP infection was defined by Medicare claims using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes. The incidence of PCP infections, graft loss, and death were measured. RESULTS: There were a total of 142 cases (cumulative incidence 0.4%) of PCP after kidney transplantation during the study period. By using multivariate analysis with Cox regression, expanded criteria donor, donation after cardiac death, and earlier year of transplant were associated with development of PCP disease. Induction immunosuppression and acute rejections were not associated with risk for PCP infections. However, based on adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), maintenance immunosuppression regimens containing the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus (AHR 3.60, confidence interval [CI] 2.03-6.39), Neoral and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.09, CI 1.31-3.31), and sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.77, CI 1.40-5.47), were associated with development of PCP. As a time dependent variable, PCP was associated with an increased risk of both graft loss and death. CONCLUSION: PCP infections are rare in the modern era of prophylaxis; however, these infections are a serious risk factor for graft loss and patient death, in particular, in patients who are on sirolimus as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. The median time to development of PCP after transplant was 0.80+/-0.95 years, suggesting a longer period of PCP prophylaxis.",M1
19549975,"Evolving health effects of Pneumocystis: one hundred years of progress in diagnosis and treatment.2009 marks the 100th anniversary of the first description of Pneumocystis, an organism that was ignored for much of its first 50 years but that has subsequently been recognized as an important pathogen of immunocompromised patients, especially patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We present a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who died from Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) despite appropriate anti-Pneumocystis therapy. Although substantial advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PCP have decreased its frequency and improved prognosis, PCP continues to be seen in both HIV-infected patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Pneumocystis species comprise a family of fungi, each of which appears to be able to infect only 1 host species. Pneumocystis has a worldwide distribution. Immunocompetent hosts clear infection without obvious clinical consequences. Pneumocystis has been identified in patients with other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although its clinical impact is uncertain. Immunocompromised patients develop disease as a consequence of reinfection and possibly reactivation of latent infection. In patients with HIV infection, the CD4 count is predictive of the risk for developing PCP, but such reliable markers are not available for other immunocompromised populations. In the majority of patients with PCP, multiple Pneumocystis strains can be identified using recently developed typing techniques. Because Pneumocystis cannot be cultured, diagnosis relies on detection of the organism by colorimetric or immunofluorescent stains or by polymerase chain reaction. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the preferred drug regimen for both treatment and prevention of PCP, although a number of alternatives are also available. Corticosteroids are an important adjunct for hypoxemic patients.",M1

The observation of several cases with reduced increase of CD4-cells upon start of antiretroviral treatment (ART) prompted us to investigate the topic using the ClinSurv cohort. METHODS: 17 German HIV treatment centers contribute to ClinSurv, a multicentre observational cohort under the auspices of the Robert Koch Institute. We retrospectively selected all antiretroviral-naive patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) and - as comparator group - with pneumocystosis (<e>PCP</e>) between January 1999 and December 2005. RESULTS: A total of 257 patients were included in the analysis, 61 with TE and 196 with PCP. Demographic baseline data showed differences with regard to gender, transmission group, and baseline CD4 superset+ counts (60.9 vs. 44.7/microl, p = 0.022). After ART-initiation the increase in CD4 superset+ lymphocytes was lower in the TE- versus the PCP-group in the first, second and fourth three-month-period (74.4 vs. 120.3/microl, p = 0.006; 96.6 vs. 136.2/microl, p = 0.021; 156.5 vs. 211.5/microl, p = 0.013). Viral load (VL) was higher in the PCP-group at baseline (4.46 log subset10cop/ml vs. 5.00 log subset10cop/ml, p = 0.008), while virological success of ART was equal. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time that the average CD4 superset+ T-cell increase of patients with toxoplasmosis is impaired compared to PCP-patients. Most clinicians would not be prepared to discontinue follow-up TE-therapy unless CD4 superset+ counts of 200/microl are reached. Explanation for our finding might be the myelosuppressive side effect of pyrimethamine, possible interactions of toxoplasmosis therapy with ART, or an unknown direct biological influence of toxoplasmosis on immune restoration.",M1

In this retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive HIV-infected patients with microscopically diagnosed PCP at San Francisco General Hospital between 1997 and 2006, 121 of 522 patients (23%) were unaware of their HIV infection prior to their diagnosis of PCP. The proportion of patients with concurrently diagnosed HIV and PCP each year remained unchanged during the study period. Patients with newly diagnosed HIV had a significantly higher alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient at presentation (median 51 vs 45 mm Hg, p =0.03), but there were no differences in mortality, frequency of mechanical ventilation, or admission to intensive care compared to patients with previously diagnosed HIV infection. In multivariate analysis, patients who reported a sexual risk factor for HIV infection were more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than patients who reported injection drug use as their only HIV risk factor (odds ratio = 3.14, 95% CI 1.59-6.18, p=0.001). This study demonstrates a continued need for HIV education and earlier HIV testing, particularly in patients with high-risk sexual behavior.",M1
19487471,"Effects of decreased calmodulin protein on the survival mechanisms of alveolar macrophages during Pneumocystis pneumonia.Pneumocystis infection causes increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent apoptosis of alveolar macrophages (Amø). Assessments of key prosurvival molecules in Amø and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected rats and mice showed low levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and reduced activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Ubiquitous calcium-sensing protein calmodulin protein and mRNA levels were also reduced in Amø during Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>Pcp</e>). Calmodulin has been implicated in control of GM-CSF production and PI-3K activation in other immune cell types. Experiments to determine the control of GM-CSF and PI-3K by calmodulin in Amø showed that GM-CSF expression and PI-3K activation could not be induced when calmodulin was inhibited. Calmodulin inhibition also led to increased levels of ROS and apoptosis in cells exposed to bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected animals. Supplementation of Amø with exogenous calmodulin increased survival signaling via GM-CSF and PI-3K and reduced ROS and apoptosis. These data support the hypotheses that calmodulin levels at least partially control survival signaling in Amø and that restoration of GM-CSF or PI-3K signaling will improve host response to the organism.",M1

In general, a combination of two antifolate agents, sulfamethoxazole (inhibition of dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS)) and trimethoprim (inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase), is the first choice for PcP treatment, and pentamidine or atovaquone (inhibition of cytochrome b) are the alternative reagents for the therapy. Amino acid substitutions of drug-binding sites in DHPS shown in genotypic analysis have been reported to be associated with failures of prophylaxis / treatment or severe mortality for PcP, while there is another article showing a negative relationship between the DHPS mutations and poor prognosis. Drug sensitivity tests using the phenotypes as well as genotypes are necessary, although it is difficult to culture Pc. This review focuses on the relationship between mutations of drug-targeting molecules and treatment failure based on original data and other reports.

Pneumocystis pneumonia causes interstitial changes, so making a diagnosis of <e>PCP</e> in patients who have interstitial pneumonia (IP) with P. jirovecii colonization is sometimes difficult based on radiography. METHODS: This study investigated the prevalence of P. jirovecii colonization in IP patients and assessed pulmonary injury due to P. jirovecii colonization by measurement of serum markers (KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, and (1--&gt;3) beta-D-glucan (beta-D-glucan)) and the peripheral lymphocyte counts, prospectively. A total of 75 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 29), collagen vascular-related interstitial pneumonia (n = 19), chronic bronchitis or pneumonia (n = 20), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 7) were enrolled in this prospective study. P. jirovecii DNA was detected in sputum samples, while serum markers and the lymphocyte count were measured in the peripheral blood. RESULTS: IP patients (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and collagen vascular-related IP) who received oral corticosteroids had a high prevalence of P. jirovecii colonization (23.3%). In IP patients, oral corticosteroid therapy was a significant risk factor for P. jirovecii colonization (P &lt; 0.05). Serum markers did not show differences between IP patients with and without P. jirovecii colonization. The beta-D-glucan level and lymphocyte count differed between patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia or P. jirovecii colonization. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, and beta-D-glucan were not useful for detecting P. jirovecii colonization in IP patients. However, the serum beta-D-glucan level and lymphocyte count were useful for distinguishing P. jirovecii colonization from pneumocystis pneumonia in IP patients.",M1

At that time, he was on maintenance treatment with azathioprine at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg per day, and had not received supplementary steroids for 9 mo. He had never received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha therapy. Shortly after apparently effective treatment with intravenous steroids and an increased dose of azathioprine, he developed worsening colitic and new respiratory symptoms, and was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). Pneumomediastinum is rare in immunocompetent hosts, but is a recognized complication of PCP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, although our patient's HIV test was negative. Treatment of PCP with co-trimoxazole resulted in resolution of both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, without the need to increase the steroid dose. There is increasing vigilance for opportunistic infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease following the advent of anti-TNFalpha therapy. This case emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of such infections in all patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irrespective of the immunosuppressants they receive, and highlights the potential of steroid-responsive opportunistic infections to mimic worsening colitic symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis.",M1

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used 2000-2004 data from the Supplement to HIV/AIDS Surveillance (SHAS) project, a cross-sectional interview project of HIV-infected persons &gt;or=18 years conducted in 18 states. We limited the analysis to persons who denied having prior PCP, reported having a current prescription to prevent PCP, and answered the question  In the past 30 days, how often were you able to take the PCP medication(s) exactly the way your doctor told you to take them?  We used multivariable logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Of 1,666 subjects prescribed PCP prophylaxis, 305 (18.3%) were nonadherent. Persons were more likely to be nonadherent if they reported using marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-2.4), non-injection drugs other than marijuana (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.1), or injection drugs (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.3-4.1) in the past year; their mental health was  not good  for &gt;or=1 day during the past month (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2); their most recent CD4 count was &lt;200 cells/microL (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2); or taking ART usually (aOR = 9.6, 95% CI = 6.7-13.7) or sometimes/rarely/never (aOR = 18.4, 95% CI = 11.1-30.4), compared with always, as prescribed.

METHODS: We compared P jiroveci PCR and conventional stains in HIV-uninfected immunocompromised patients. RESULTS: Among the 448 patients, 296 (66%) patients had hematologic malignancies; 72 (16.1%), bone marrow transplants; 44 (9.8%), solid tumors; 21 (4.7%), renal transplants; and 15 (3.4%) were taking immunosuppressants for systemic diseases. Diagnostic strategy consisted of BAL in 351 patients and induced sputum (IS) in 97 patients. Conventional pneumocystic pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) stain was positive in 39 (8.7%) patients, including 34 with positive PCR. In addition, PCR was positive in 32 patients, including 21 with complete follow-up, of whom 14 were diagnosed with probable or definitive PCP (a 36% increase). PCR was 87.2% sensitive and 92.2% specific; positive and negative predictive values were 51.5% and 98.7%, respectively. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were 100% on IS. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-uninfected immunocompromised patients with acute pulmonary infiltrates, P jiroveci PCR correlates with clinical evidence of PCP.

19255292,"Trends in hospitalizations for AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in the United States (1986 to 2005).BACKGROUND: Although hospitalizations for AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in the United States have decreased since the introduction of chemoprophylaxis and potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), PCP remains an important cause of illness and death among AIDS patients. METHODS: We analyzed trends in AIDS-associated PCP hospital discharges using the National Hospital Discharge Surveys between 1986 and 2005. RESULTS: An estimated 539 million patients were discharged from hospitals between 1986 and 2005, of whom an estimated 312,411 had AIDS-associated PCP. The proportion of patients discharged from the hospital with AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 31% before the introduction of chemoprophylaxis (1986 to 1989) to 17% with chemoprophylaxis (1990 to 1995) and subsequently to 9% after the introduction of ART in 1996 (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality from AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 21 to 16% and subsequently to 7% between these three time periods (p &lt; 0.001). Among those who received mechanical ventilation, mortality decreased from 79% in the prechemoprophylaxis era to 31% in the ART era (p &lt; 0.001) alongside an increase (from 5 to 11%) in the use of mechanical ventilation. We also observed a shift in the population at-risk for PCP over time: a greater proportion of black people, women, and people from Southern states were affected (all p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While there have been significant reductions in hospitalizations and hospital mortality for AIDS-associated PCP over the last 20 years, these reductions have not been homogenous across demographic subpopulations and geographic regions and point to new at-risk populations. Furthermore, mortality in severe cases of PCP that require mechanical ventilation has improved substantially.",M1

At the onset of PCP, the median dosages of prednisolone and methotrexate were 7.5 mg/day and 8 mg/week, respectively. Pneumocystis jiroveci was microscopically identified in only 2 patients, although the polymerase chain reaction test for the organism was positive in 20 patients. The patients with PCP had significantly lower serum albumin levels (P &lt; 0.001) and lower serum IgG levels (P &lt; 0.001) than the patients without PCP. Computed tomography of the chest in all patients with PCP revealed ground-glass opacity either with sharp demarcation by interlobular septa or without interlobular septal boundaries. Sixteen of the 21 patients with PCP developed acute respiratory failure, but all survived. CONCLUSION: PCP is a serious complication that may occur early in the course of infliximab therapy in patients with RA. For the proper clinical management of this infectious disease, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of PCP developing during infliximab therapy.",M1
19218768,"Clinical utility of serum beta-D-glucan and KL-6 levels in Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.OBJECTIVE: New serum markers (1--&gt;3) beta-D-glucan (beta-D-glucan) and KL-6 are reported to be useful for the clinical diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). However, the utility of these markers in PCP with HIV infection (HIV PCP) and without HIV (non-HIV PCP) is unknown. This study was aimed to evaluate the utility of beta-D-glucan and KL-6 for the diagnosis of PCP in patients with HIV infection (HIV PCP) and non-HIV PCP. METHODS: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive 35 patients. The serum levels of beta-D-glucan and KL-6 in HIV PCP and non-HIV PCP were comparatively evaluated. We evaluated these markers in survivors and non survivors. RESULTS: The detection rates of serum beta-D-glucan and KL-6 levels in non-HIV PCP were lower than those in HIV PCP (88% vs. 100%, 66% vs. 88%, respectively). The false positive rates of these markers in both groups were similar (12%, 37%, respectively). Oxygenation index, serum albumin, and mechanical ventilation were the variables which were significantly associated with poor outcome in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, beta-D-glucan was a reliable diagnostic marker for PCP. However, the detection rate of beta-D-glucan and KL-6 in non-HIV PCP was lower than in HIV PCP. Neither beta-D-glucan nor KL-6 was associated with the outcome of PCP.",M1
19211148,"Low prevalence of human metapneumovirus and human bocavirus in adult immunocompromised high risk patients suspected to suffer from Pneumocystis pneumonia.BACKGROUND: Novel respiratory viruses were discovered in the last years predominantly in children. Until now information on newly identified respiratory viruses in immunosuppressed adult patients is limited. Here we investigated immunocompromised adults with suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) for new respiratory viruses. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 128 patients with atypical pneumonia (HIV-infected n=50, hematological malignancy n=51, immunosuppressive treatment n=27) were prospectively evaluated for P. jirovecii and retrospectively for new respiratory viruses (HMPV, HBoV, HCoV-NL63/SARS/HKU1). RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 26/128, bacteria in 10, fungi in four, Influenza A in two patients. Novel respiratory viruses were found in only two/128 patients with hematological malignancy, of those one patient with HBoV-infection and one with HMPV-infection, respectively. No pathogens were detected in 82/128 patients. The one patient with detection of hMPV and clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonia died of pulmonary failure. CONCLUSION: Human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus are rarely involved in atypical pneumonia in immunocompromised adult patients with suspected PCP, but may contribute to severe respiratory failure.",M1

Here we report a renal transplant recipient who received belatacept and developed severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) with fatal superinfections 4 years post transplant. Cytomegalovirus infection preceded PCP, which typically occurs in overimmunosuppressed patients, but has not yet been reported under T-cell costimulation blockade in transplant patients.

19210645,"Real-time PCR is more specific than conventional PCR for induced sputum diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunocompromised patients without HIV infection.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is based on microscopic examination of respiratory specimens. PCP patients without AIDS have a lower burden of P. jiroveci than those with AIDS, which leads to difficulty in detecting the organisms. Although conventional PCR (c-PCR) has been used to detect the DNA, it is frequently positive in patients with colonization. Real-time PCR (r-PCR), a method to detect the DNA quantitatively, might be helpful in distinguishing between infection and colonization. We investigated the utility of real-time PCR in the diagnosis of PCP in non-AIDS patients. METHODS: Induced sputum samples obtained from 86 non-HIV immunocompromized patients with clinical symptoms of pulmonary infection were evaluated for the presence of Pneumocystis jiroveci-specific DNA using c-PCR and r-PCR. The diagnosis of PCP was confirmed by typical clinical and radiological findings and response to treatment. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients, 17 were diagnosed as having PCP. Twenty-eight samples were positive for c-PCR, but the false-positive rate was high (46.4%). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPV) of c-PCR were 88.2%, 81.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Concentrations of the DNA detected by r-PCR were significantly higher in PCP patients than in non-PCP patients. Using 30 copies per tube as a cut-off value for the diagnosis of PCP, the sensitivity (82.4%) of r-PCR was almost equal to c-PCR. Notably, its specificity and PPV were higher than c-PCR (98.6% and 93.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: r-PCR on induced sputum is more useful for diagnosing PCP than c-PCR in non-HIV immunocompromized patients, especially in terms of distinguishing between colonization and infection.",M1
19201882,"Immune reconstitution during Pneumocystis lung infection: disruption of surfactant component expression and function by S-nitrosylation.Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>), the most common opportunistic pulmonary infection associated with HIV infection, is marked by impaired gas exchange and significant hypoxemia. Immune reconstitution disease (IRD) represents a syndrome of paradoxical respiratory failure in patients with active or recently treated PCP subjected to immune reconstitution. To model IRD, C57BL/6 mice were selectively depleted of CD4(+) T cells using mAb GK1.5. Following inoculation with Pneumocystis murina cysts, infection was allowed to progress for 2 wk, GK1.5 was withdrawn, and mice were followed for another 2 or 4 wk. Flow cytometry of spleen cells demonstrated recovery of CD4(+) cells to &gt;65% of nondepleted controls. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid harvested from IRD mice were analyzed in tandem with samples from CD4-depleted mice that manifested progressive PCP for 6 wks. Despite significantly decreased pathogen burdens, IRD mice had persistent parenchymal lung inflammation, increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity, markedly impaired surfactant biophysical function, and decreased amounts of surfactant phospholipid and surfactant protein (SP)-B. Paradoxically, IRD mice also had substantial increases in the lung collectin SP-D, including significant amounts of an S-nitrosylated form. By native PAGE, formation of S-nitrosylated SP-D in vivo resulted in disruption of SP-D multimers. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from IRD mice selectively enhanced macrophage chemotaxis in vitro, an effect that was blocked by ascorbate treatment. We conclude that while PCP impairs pulmonary function and produces abnormalities in surfactant components and biophysics, these responses are exacerbated by IRD. This worsening of pulmonary inflammation, in response to persistent Pneumocystis Ags, is mediated by recruitment of effector cells modulated by S-nitrosylated SP-D.",M1
19158080,"Pneumocystis mediates overexpression of antizyme inhibitor resulting in increased polyamine levels and apoptosis in alveolar macrophages.Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PcP</e>) is the most common opportunistic disease in immunocompromised patients. Alveolar macrophages are responsible for the clearance of Pneumocystis organisms; however, they undergo a high rate of apoptosis during PcP due to increased intracellular polyamine levels. In this study, the sources of polyamines and mechanisms of polyamine increase and polyamine-induced apoptosis were investigated. The level of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was elevated in alveolar macrophages, and the number of alveolar macrophages that took up exogenous polyamines was increased 20-fold during PcP. Monocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ T lymphocytes that were recruited into the lung during PcP expressed high levels of ornithine decarboxylase, suggesting that these cells are sources of polyamines. Both protein and mRNA levels of antizyme inhibitor (AZI) were increased in alveolar macrophages during PcP. This AZI overexpression correlated with increased polyamine uptake by alveolar macrophages, because AZI expression knockdown decreased the polyamine uptake ability of these cells. AZI expression knockdown also decreased the apoptosis rate of alveolar macrophages. Pneumocystis organisms and zymosan A were found to induce AZI overexpression in alveolar macrophages, suggesting that beta-glucan, which is the major component of the Pneumocystis cell wall, induces AZI overexpression. The levels of mRNA, protein, and activity of polyamine oxidase were increased in alveolar macrophages during PcP, indicating that the H(2)O(2) generated during polyamine catabolism caused alveolar macrophages to undergo apoptosis. Taken together, results of this study indicate that Pneumocystis organisms induce AZI overexpression in alveolar macrophages, leading to increased polyamine synthesis and uptake and apoptosis rate of these cells.",M1

The patients who contracted Pneumocystis jeroveccii were retrospectively selected from our medical charts and conditions related to the patients' death were reviewed. The findings indicated that lower levels of serum albumin and cholinesterase, increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, intratracheal intubation, and necessity to treat in the intensive care unit were significantly related to deaths associated with PCP in CVD. A special attention should be paid to decreased serum albumin and cholinesterase as ominous predictors in PCP occurred in patients with CVD.",M1

Incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) among patients with systemic rheumatic diseases varies from 0.2% for rheumatoid arthritis to up 12% for Wegener's granulomatosis. Clinical and radiological presentation of pneumocystis pneumonia among non-VIH patients is often difficult to diagnose and the installation can be abrupt. Most of cases of PCP occur during the first 3 months following the beginning of immunosuppressant agents. Mortality during PCP is high with an average of 40% of death, rising 60% in case of mechanical ventilation. Prophylaxis of PCP is needed (without support by randomised studies) for patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, in case of cyclophosphamide or high-dose of methotrexate use except for rheumatoid patients, if a simultaneous treatment by corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agent is required, if a prolonged corticosteroid treatment (&gt; 2 months) is used with dose of prednisone-equivalent &gt; 16mg per day or &gt; 20mg per day &gt; 1month associated with one or more risk factors of PCP among advanced age, denutrition or deep lymphopenia.

AIM: The present study was conducted to compare polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targetting three different genes of Pneumocystis to study their application in its diagnosis. METHODS: One hundred and eighty (n = 180) clinical samples from 145 immunocompromised patients with clinical suspicion of PCP and 35 samples from control group of 30 immunocompetent individuals with respiratory infections other than PCP were prospectively examined for the presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). All the samples were subjected to microscopic examination, one single [major surface glycoprotein, (MSG)] and two nested [mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal ribonucelic acid, (mtLSU rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region], polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Microscopic examination was positive in only six (n = 6) patients, whereas single round MSG PCR detected P. jirovecii deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 16 cases. When the clinical samples were tested by mtLSU rRNA and ITS nested PCR assays, it was possible to detect seven additional cases of PCP, making it to a total of 23 cases. None of the clinical specimens in control group (n = 30) were positive by any of the above-mentioned techniques. Amongst the 81 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples tested, 16 were positive by MSG PCR, while 20 were positive by both nested, i.e., mtLSU rRNA and ITS PCR assays. Similarly, out of 50 sputum samples, only three were positive by MSG, seven by mtLSU rRNA and six by ITS nested PCR assays. CONCLUSION: It has been observed that MSG is relatively more sensitive when single round PCR assay is used for detection of human Pneumocystosis compared to the first (single) rounds of either ITS or mtLSU rRNA nested PCRs. However, the two nested PCRs using ITS and mtLSU rRNA have been found to be more sensitive. On comparison of two nested PCR assays, the results have been more or less comparable.",M1

We report 2 cases of lymphoma complicated with Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously known as P. carinii) pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) while being treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens. In both cases, PCP developed during the neutropenic period. With timely diagnosis and proper management, both were treated successfully. We searched the literature and found that such opportunistic infection occurred only infrequently in lymphoma patients, and it has not been reported in the large-scale clinical trials of rituximab. Such cases demonstrate the importance of taking PCP into diagnostic consideration in lymphoma patients receiving similar therapies.",M1
18971152,"Pneumocystis pneumonia.Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PcP</e>) in humans is caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, which has recently been reclassified as a fungus because its cell wall composition and nucleotide sequences are more similar to those of fungi. PcP occurs only in immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS. Despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, PcP remains the leading opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. Based on nucleotide sequence variations in the internal transcribed spacer region of rRNA genes, more than 60 different types of P. jirovecii have been identified. Although type differences do not appear to correlate with the clinical characteristics of PcP, nucleotide sequence variations of the organism have been useful in epidemiologic studies. As a result, some recurrent infections are found to be due to re-infection with new types, and outbreaks due to the same types of P. jirovecii have been identified. Initial diagnosis of PcP is usually based on symptoms and chest radiography. A characteristic histopathologic feature is the presence of acellular eosinophilic exudates and organisms in the alveoli. Ultimate diagnosis of PcP is achieved by demonstration of the organism in induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by tinctorial staining or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the many different PCR methods, the nested PCR that targets the large subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene is the most sensitive and specific. Combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is the first choice of drugs for both treatment and prophylaxis of PcP. Other drugs that can be used include a combination of primaquine and clindamycin, pentamidine, atovaquone, and a combination of dapsone and trimethoprim. Pneumocystis organisms have the ability to inactivate the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages and to induce them to undergo apoptosis. This apoptosis is due to activation of caspase 9 by polyamines that are present in high levels in the lung and alveolar macrophages during PcP.",M1
18828021,"Risk factors of Pneumocystis jeroveci pneumonia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.Pneumocystis jeroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is an opportunistic infection which occurs mostly in the immune-deficiency host. Although PCP infected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient carries poor outcome, no standard guideline for prevention has been established. The aim of our study is to identify the risk factors which will indicate the PCP prophylaxis in SLE. This is a case control study. A search of Ramathibodi hospital's medical records between January 1994 and March 2004, demonstrates 15 cases of SLE with PCP infection. Clinical and laboratory data of these patients were compared to those of 60 matched patients suffering from SLE but no PCP infection. Compared to SLE without PCP, those with PCP infection have significantly higher activity index by MEX-SLEDAI (13.6 +/- 5.83 vs. 6.73 +/- 3.22) or more renal involvement (86 vs. 11.6%, P &lt; 0.01), higher mean cumulative dose of steroid (49 +/- 29 vs. 20 +/- 8 mg/d, P &lt; 0.01), but lower lymphocyte count (520 +/- 226 vs. 1420 +/- 382 cells/mm(3), P &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, in all cases, a marked reduction in lymphocyte count (710 +/- 377 cells/mm(3)) is observed before the onset of PCP infection. The estimated CD4+ count is also found to be lower in the PCP group (156 +/- 5 vs. 276 +/- 8 cells/mm(3)). Our study revealed that PCP infected SLE patients had higher disease activity, higher dose of prednisolone treatment, more likelihood of renal involvement, and lower lymphocyte count as well as lower CD4+ count than those with no PCP infection. These data should be helpful in selecting SLE patients who need PCP prophylaxis.",M1

Epidemiology of PCP in the recent era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not well known and the impact of HAART on outcome of PCP has been debated. AIM: To determine the epidemiology of PCP in HIV-infected patients and examine the impact of HAART on PCP outcome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 262 patients diagnosed with PCP between January 2000 and December 2003 at a county hospital at an academic medical center. Death while in the hospital was the main outcome measure. Multivariate modeling was performed to determine predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Overall hospital mortality was 11.6%. Mortality in patients requiring intensive care was 29.0%. The need for mechanical ventilation, development of a pneumothorax, and low serum albumin were independent predictors of increased mortality. One hundred and seven patients received HAART before hospitalization and 16 patients were started on HAART while in the hospital. HAART use either before or during hospitalization was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Overall hospital mortality and mortality predictors are similar to those reported earlier in the HAART era. PCP diagnoses in HAART users likely represented failing HAART regimens or non-compliance with HAART.",M1

Twenty HIV-negative patients with no chest symptoms constituted Group A, 25 HIV antibody positive asymptomatic children formed Group B, while 45 HIV antibody positive children with respiratory infections comprised Group C. Group C was subdivided into C(1) (n = 20, documented PCP on microbiology), C(2) (n = 10, tuberculosis) and C(3) (n = 15, bacterial pneumonias). The mean age group of patients in Group A, Group B and Group C was 4.7 +/- 1.9, 4.2 +/- 1.5 and 4.8 +/- 1.7 years, respectively. All patients were subjected to complete blood count, blood culture, chest radiographs, microscopic staining of sputum (PCP stains, Ziehl-Nielsen staining, Gram staining), ABG and Mantoux test. All these patients underwent dynamic lung scans using (99m)Tc-DTPA aerosols and lung clearance was calculated in terms of half-time transfer value (T(1/2)) value. T(1/2) was compared between different groups and lung scan findings were correlated with radiological and microbiological results. Patients with PCP had T(1/2) in the range of 9.02 +/- 1.35, TB 28.2 +/- 3.03 min and other bacterial pneumonias in the range of 20.5 +/- 3.1 min (range for normal individuals was 49.8 +/- 6.13 min). T(1/2) in patients with PCP was found to be significantly lower when compared with T(1/2) in other groups. Patients with PCP had characteristic biphasic curves while the rest had monophasic curves. Some patients with PCP had low T(1/2) values even when chest radiographs and arterial blood gases were normal.

DESIGN: A cohort study conducted in consecutive hospitalized Asian patients. METHODS: Multivariate analyses were performed on the Cambodian sample to determine clinical, radiological, and biological predictors of PCP or TB at hospital admission. The Vietnamese sample was kept for independent validation. RESULTS: In Cambodia, the gold standard technique for TB and PCP were fulfilled in 172 (27 cases) and 160 (84 cases) patients, respectively. For TB, independent predictors included the following: headache [odds ratio (OR) 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 8.6], localized radiological opacity (OR 5.8; 95% CI 1.9-17.9), and mediastinal adenopathy (OR 10.1; 95% CI 3.5 to 29.0); and for PCP: resting oxygen saturation &lt;90% (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 8.5 for resting arterial oxygen saturation &gt;or=80%; and OR 9.1; 95% CI 1.8 to 44.5 for resting arterial oxygen saturation &lt;80%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.6), and diffuse radiological shadowing (OR 7.0; 95% CI 2.7 to 18.6). PCP risk predicted by a score based on these 3 factors ranged from 3% to 92% (Cambodia). When tested on Vietnamese patients (n = 69, 38 with PCP), the score maintained correct predictive ability (c-index = 0.72) but with poor calibration.

DESIGN: Double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Infants with a clinical diagnosis of PCP, based on an 'atypical' pneumonia with: (i) hypoxia out of proportion to the clinical findings on auscultation; (ii) C-reactive protein count less than 10 mg/1; (iii) lactate dehydrogenase level above 500 IU/1; (iv) compatible chest radiograph findings; and (v) positive HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbert assay (ELISA) were included in the study. Patients were randomised to receive either prednisone or placebo. The protocol provided for the addition of prednisone to the treatment at 48 hours if there was clinical deterioration or an independent indication for steroid therapy. Other treatment was carried out in accordance with established guidelines. The primary study endpoint was in-hospital survival. Secondary outcome was time from admission to the first day of mean oxygen saturation above 90% in room air. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 47 in the prednisone and 53 in the placebo group. Patients in the prednisone group had a 43% better chance of survival than the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 - 1.07, p=0.08). No significant differences could be demonstrated between groups with regard to other parameters of recovery. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-exposed infants with clinical PCP, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment does not appear to add benefit regarding time to recovery or oxygen independency, but early administration may improve survival. A large multicentred trial is needed to confirm these findings.",M1

Animal models of HIV-AIDS-related PcP indicate that development of severe disease is dependent on the presence of CD8(+) T cells and the TNF receptors (TNFR) TNFRsf1a and TNFRsf1b. To distinguish roles of parenchymal and hematopoietic cell TNF signaling in PcP-related lung injury, murine bone marrow transplant chimeras of wild-type, C57BL6/J, and TNFRsf1a/1b double-null origin were generated, CD4(+) T cell depleted, and inoculated with Pc. As expected, C57 --&gt; C57 chimeras (donor marrow --&gt; recipient) developed significant disease as assessed by weight loss, impaired pulmonary function (lung resistance and dynamic lung compliance), and inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast, TNFRsf1a/1b(-/-) --&gt; TNFRsf1a/1b(-/-) mice were relatively mildly affected despite carrying the greatest organism burden. Mice solely lacking parenchymal TNFRs (C57 --&gt; TNFRsf1a/1b(-/-)) had milder disease than did C57 --&gt; C57 mice. Both groups of mice with TNFR-deficient parenchymal cells had low bronchoalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts and fewer lavageable CD8(+) T cells than did C57 --&gt; C57 mice, suggesting that parenchymal TNFR signaling contributes to PcP-related immunopathology through the recruitment of damaging immune cells. Interestingly, mice with wild-type parenchymal cells but TNFRsf1a/1b(-/-) hematopoietic cells (TNFRsf1a/1b(-/-) --&gt; C57) displayed exacerbated disease characterized by increased MCP-1 and KC production in the lung and increased macrophage and lymphocyte numbers in the lavage, indicating a dysregulated immune response.

18573675,"Acute respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia: outcome and prognostic factors.OBJECTIVES: To examine the outcome and prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) caused by Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) admitted to a medical intensive care unit. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with ARF from PCP in Ramathibodi Hospital between 2000 and 2006. Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and laboratory, radiological and microbiological findings, as well as therapy and clinical course were included in the analysis of prognostic factors of death. RESULTS: A total of 14 HIV-infected and 30 otherwise immunosuppressed patients were identified. The overall mortality rate was 63.6%. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that APACHE II score on day 1 and level of PEEP used on day 3 of respiratory failure were associated with higher hospital mortality. In a comparison between the HIV group and the non-HIV group, the early mortality rate was significantly higher in the HIV group, but late hospital mortality was not different between the two groups. Using a univariate logistic regression model, four parameters were found to be significantly associated with death in the HIV group: sex, APACHE II score on day 1, CMV co-infection, and level of PEEP on day 3 of ARF. In the non-HIV group, corticosteroid use prior to diagnosis of PCP and level of PEEP on day 3 of ARF were found to be the significant parameters. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in patients with ARF caused by PCP was high. Various variable factors were related to a poor prognosis. For improved survival, multimodality treatments are needed to reduce these risk factors.",M1

Initially 89 patients (74%) received oral administration of 2 single-strength trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) tablets twice daily from day -21. In 45 of 89 patients (51%), TMP-SMZ administration for a scheduled duration was completed. In the remaining 44 patients (49%), however, TMP-SMZ administration was discontinued prior to day -3 because of toxicity. Among these patients, 42 subsequently received aerosolized pentamidine (AP) on a median of day -13 (range, -20 to -6). Thirty-one patients (26%) received AP without TMP-SMZ administration on a median of day -14 (range, -21 to -9). None of the 120 patients were diagnosed with PCP within 100 days or 2 years after CBT; however, one patient who received AP before CBT but no prophylaxis after CBT developed cerebral toxoplasmosis on day +91. Pre-transplant prophylaxis against PCP did not significantly affect transplantation-related mortality or disease-free survival at 2 years after CBT. The results suggest that PCP during the early period after CBT can be effectively prevented by any pre-transplant prophylactic method.",M1
18554841,"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in Spanish HIV-infected patients in the combined antiretroviral therapy era: prevalence of dihydropteroate synthase mutations and prognostic factors of mortality.The incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in HIV-infected patients has decreased thanks to sulfa prophylaxis and combined antiretroviral therapy. The influence of P. jirovecii dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene mutations on survival is controversial and has not been reported in Spain. This prospective multicenter study enrolled 207 HIV-infected patients with PCP from 2000 to 2004. Molecular genotyping was performed on stored specimens. Risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were identified using a logistic regression model. Seven patients (3.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-7.5%) had DHPS mutations. Overall mortality was 15% (95% CI, 10-21%), rising to 80% (95% CI, 61-92%) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. None of the patients with DHPS mutants died, nor did they need ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. PaO(2) &lt;60 mm Hg at admission was a predictor of ICU admission (P = 0.01), and previous antiretroviral therapy predicted non-ICU admission (P = 0.009). PaO(2) &lt;60 mm Hg at admission and ICU admission during the 1st week were predictors of mortality (P = 0.03 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The prevalence of DHPS mutants in Spain is low and is not associated with a worse outcome. Severe respiratory failure at admission is the strongest predictor of PCP outcome.",M1
18553280,"CT findings in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infections.PURPOSE: To evaluate computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, and to detect the accuracy of first-choice diagnoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT chest scans of 57 immunocompromised patients who had pulmonary infections were evaluated retrospectively, and a first and second interpretation of etiology (first- and second-choice diagnosis) was proposed. The etiology of pulmonary infection was verified by microbiological tests such as blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures, sputum, and BAL smears, or diagnosed on the basis of response to treatment and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had a bacterial infection, 20 patients had a fungal infection, 8 patients had a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, 8 patients had Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) and 2 patients had a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. There were consolidations in 13 patients (68.4%) and areas of ground-glass attenuation and ground-glass nodules in 6 patients (31.6%) with bacterial infection. Six of 8 eight patients (75%) with CMV infection had centrilobular nodules associated with bronchial wall thickening and ground-glass areas and nodules. There were parenchymal nodules in 18 of 20 patients (90%) who had a fungal infection. All 8 patients who had PCP had bilateral areas of ground-glass densities on CT scans. The first-choice diagnosis was accurate in most of the fungal infections (95.0%) and PCP (87.5%), but was less accurate for bacterial and viral infections (73.7% and 75.0%, respectively). Neither of the 2 tuberculous infections was identified on the basis of CT findings. CONCLUSION: In the evaluation of febrile immunocompromised patients, pulmonary fungal infection and PCP may be identified with high accuracy on the basis of CT findings.",M1
18544202,"Tuberculosis as primary cause of death among AIDS cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.SETTING: Data from the mortality database, Rio de Janeiro City (RJC) Health Department, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. OBJECTIVES: To determine the role played by tuberculosis (TB) in Brazil's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive population, we investigated the frequency of TB as the primary cause of death among HIV-positive subjects in RJC. DESIGN: Information about acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) deaths from 1996 to 2005 in individuals aged &gt;12 years was obtained from the Mortality Information System (SIM), and the cause of death was classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), through primary causes coded in Chapter I--B20 to B24 (HIV disease). RESULTS: There were 8601 AIDS-related deaths in RJC between 1996 and 2005. TB was the primary cause of death in 9.0% of all AIDS-related deaths, while Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) accounted for 4.7%. TB cases erroneously classified under other infectious diseases may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of TB deaths among HIV-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that TB is the leading cause of AIDS-related deaths and is responsible for twice as many deaths as PCP, in a scenario of free access to antiretrovirals. The potential benefits of TB preventive treatment and of the availability of highly active antiretroviral treatment could not be established by this analysis.",M1
18483698,"Evaluation of Toluidine Blue O staining for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci in expectorated sputum sample and bronchoalveolar lavage from HIV-infected patients in a tertiary care referral center in Ethiopia.BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is becoming increasingly recognized in sub-Saharan Africa. The currently recommended diagnostic methods using induced sputum (IS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are neither technically feasible nor affordable for a wider clinical use in developing countries. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and affordable diagnostic test. METHODS: The yield of Toluidine Blue O (TBO) stain, immunofluorescence (IF), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci were compared in 78 expectorated sputum and 118 BAL samples of 131 HIV-infected patients presenting with atypical chest X-ray and sputum smear-negative for acid-fast bacilli. RESULTS: A total of 56 (42.7%) patients tested positive for P. jiroveci by PCR, 39 (29.4%) by IF, and 28 (21.4%) by TBO stain. The sensitivity of TBO as compared to IF and PCR was 71.4% and 34.5% in expectorated sputum and 68% and 41.5% in BAL samples, respectively, with a specificity approaching 100% in both. The sputum PCR showed high concordance rate with BAL PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of sputum PCR as compared to BALPCR was 78.9% and 89%, respectively. In both TBO and IF positive BAL samples, majority were from patients who could not produce sputum (p&lt;0.001). The density of P. jiroveci clusters in BAL samples did not correlate with prior co-trimoxazole use, immunologic status of the patient or overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Compared to IF, TBO staining has an acceptable sensitivity and very high specificity both in expectorated sputum and BAL samples. Expectorated sputum is, therefore, the most practical specimen and TBO staining an inexpensive diagnostic method to be recommended for high-HIV, resource-constrained settings. Bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of PCP is often not required for patients who can produce sputum. For patients who cannot produce sputum, however, the cost and efficacy of TBO in IS sample needs to be investigated in resource-poor countries.",M1
18482201,"Absence of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients receiving short-term (3-month) prophylaxis.Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) is a fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in liver transplant recipients. Consequently, prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is typically administered for at least 1 year at most liver transplant programs. At our center we have utilized a short-term (3-month) prophylactic regimen with TMP/SMZ for the past decade and report our experience and speculate on the potential widespread application of this approach. METHODS: For patients transplanted at our center between January 1997 and January 2007, we recorded all documented PCP infections by review of our liver transplant database and hospital-based electronic medical records system, both of which record all infections and culture results. RESULTS: We recorded no cases of PCP in any of the liver transplant recipients at our center during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: We report the absence of PCP in a large cohort of liver transplant recipients receiving a short-term (3-month) prophylaxis with TMP/SMZ. These findings provide a rational basis to consider short-term (3-month) PCP prophylaxis or avoidance of prophylaxis altogether in selected low-risk patients.",M1
18480575,"Clinical and radiological features of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in comparison with methotrexate pneumonitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a multicenter study.OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the clinical and radiological features of Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with methotrexate (MTX) pneumonitis in RA and Pneumocystis pneumonia in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 14 PCP cases in RA (RA-PCP), 10 MTX pneumonitis cases in RA (MTX-P) and 11 PCP cases in AIDS (AIDS-PCP) from 9 centers in the Kanto area in the last 6 years. RESULTS: Compared with AIDS-PCP, both RA-PCP and MTX-P developed more rapidly, showing higher serum CRP and lower plasma beta-D-glucan levels, and more severe oxygenation impairment. In most of the RA-PCP cases, a high dose of corticosteroid was administered as adjunctive therapy, resulting in a favorable outcome. The mortality was 14% in RA-PCP, 0% in AIDS-PCP and 0% in MTX-P cases. In RA-PCP patients the CD4 cell count showed only mild suppression, not reaching the predisposing level for PCP in HIV infection, suggesting that there are risk factors for RA-PCP other than immunosuppression. Radiologic analysis revealed some characteristic patterns of each disease. In MTX-P, diffuse homogeneous ground glass opacity (GGO) with sharp demarcation by interlobular septa (type A GGO) was found in 70%, while in AIDS-PCP diffuse, homogeneous or nonhomogeneous GGO without interlobular septal boundaries (type B GGO) was predominant (91%). In RA-PCP, type A GGO was found in 6 cases and type B GGO in 5 cases, showing the complex nature of this disease. CONCLUSION: RA-PCP differed considerably from AIDS-PCP clinically and radiologically. Clinically it occurred without severe immunosuppression, and showed characteristic aspects, with more intense inflammation and less parasite burden. Radiologically it mimicked MTX-P in some cases sharing the conspicuous CT features of MTX-P, rendering the distinction of these two disorders difficult.",M1
18463325,"Delayed severe pneumonia in mycophenolate mofetil-treated patients with IgA nephropathy.BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a relatively new immunosuppressant, is widely used in the field of transplantation and also for autoimmune diseases with good tolerance. It has been reported that MMF possesses potent activity against pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). This study investigated the effects of this treatment on the occurrence of severe pneumonia (SP) including PCP and its risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Of 850 IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients that were followed up in our renal centre, 32 received MMF (1-1.5 g/day) and 47 were treated with cyclophosphamide (CTX; 50-100 mg/day). All the patients also received prednisone. SP was defined as diffuse bilateral lung infiltrate with respiratory failure, and PCP was diagnosed by detecting organisms in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage. RESULTS: Patients given MMF or CTX did not differ in their distribution of age, sex, renal function or prednisone dosage. However, 6 of the 32 patients developed SP around the third month after the initiation of MMF administration: 3 were diagnosed with PCP, 2 with suspected PCP and in the other PCP could not be excluded. SP did not occur in patients treated with CTX. Most SP cases (five of six) presented with abrupt onset and rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, from which four died. The deterioration of renal function was strongly associated with the occurrence of SP. Six patients (6 of 16) with chronic renal function impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) developed SP while none of the patients with eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) did. Absolute lymphocyte counts decreased significantly in patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) after 3 months of MMF treatment compared to the counts before MMF was initiated (1.71 +/- 0.23 versus 2.43 +/- 0.17 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.04). This effect was more pronounced in patients with SP, which had significantly lower counts than patients without SP (0.22 +/- 0.04 versus 1.91 +/- 0.20 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.001). The occurrence of SP or PCP in patients with chronically impaired renal function was also associated with lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of delayed SP including PCP following MMF plus corticosteroids in patients with IgAN. Chronically impaired renal function might be a risk factor for severe infection, and lymphocyte counts may serve as useful and convenient tools for monitoring the intendance of the occurrence of PCP. This finding and its risk factors need to be further evaluated.",M1
18455558,"Radiographic features of paediatric pneumocystis pneumonia -- a historical perspective.AIM: To determine differences between the plain radiographic features of paediatric pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) recorded before the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1982 and those documented in the HIV era. To establish differences in the radiographic features of PCP documented in HIV-infected children in developed and developing countries. METHOD: A Medline search of articles was conducted from 1950 to 2006, using the terms  pneumocystis pneumonia in children  and  chest radiographic features  or  bilateral opacification  or  lobar consolidation  or  asymmetrical opacification  or  pneumatocoeles  or  cavities  or  pneumothorax  or  pneumomediastinum  or  pleural effusion  or  mediastinal adenopathy  or  nodules  or  normal chest radiography . Appropriate articles were retrieved, radiological data extracted, reference lists examined and hand searches of referenced articles conducted. RESULTS: Diffuse bilateral  ground-glass  or alveolar pulmonary opacification, which may show some asymmetry, has been consistently documented as the commonest radiographic finding in childhood PCP throughout the period under review. The less common radiological features of PCP in children are similar to those in adults. In developed countries, PCP-related pulmonary air cysts have been reported at an earlier age in HIV-infected children, compared with uninfected children. PCP-related air cysts, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum have been reported in children in developed but not in developing countries. CONCLUSION: The radiological features of paediatric PCP documented before the HIV epidemic are similar to those recorded in the HIV era. Further study of the determinants of the uncommon radiographic features in children is warranted.",M1
18442007,"[Effects of Fructus Psoralea and Brucea javanica on the level of IL-2 and NK cell in rats infected with Pneumocystis carinii]SD rat model of <e>PCP</e> was established by subcutaneous injection with dexamethasone. The treatment groups received Fructus Psoralea (FP, 10.0 mg/kg), Brucea javanica (BJ, 1.2 mg/kg) and a mixture of the two Chinese herbs(FP 5mg/kg, BJ 0.6 mg/kg) respectively. By means of detecting the level of IL-2 in sera and NK cells in spleens, the effect of FP and BJ on the level of IL-2 and NK cells in rats with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was observed, with SMZco treatment group (TMP 50 mg/kg, SMZ 250 mg/kg) and groups of infected and normal rats as controls. Compared with the infected group, the level of IL-2(526.1 +/- 5.5) pg/ml and NK cells (27.1% +/- 0.8%) significantly increased in the FP group (P &lt; 0.01), followed by the FP/BJ combination group [(314.7 +/- 6.7) pg/ml, 22.9% +/- 0.9%) (P &lt; 0.05)], and BJ group [(285.4 +/- 6.1) pg/ml, 20.7% +/- l.0%) (P &lt; 0.05)].

18415849,"Study of DHPS and DHFR genes of Pneumocystis jirovecii in Thai HIV-infected patients.The combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. Many studies have shown that mutations in the drug target, the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene, are presumably involved with the failure of prophylaxis and treatment. We have analyzed dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mutations in P. jirovecii isolates recovered from Thai patients. Out of 17 samples, 11.7% (2) of the DHPS gene contained a double mutation at codon 55 and codon 57, whereas out of 18 samples, 61.1% (11) of the DHFR genes contained the silent mutation at codon 104. In comparison to previous reports, we have found a higher number of DHFR mutations but a lower prevalence of DHPS mutations.",M1
18400546,"Decreased inflammatory response in Toll-like receptor 2 knockout mice is associated with exacerbated Pneumocystis pneumonia.Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PcP</e>) is marked by substantial inflammatory damage to the lung. We have found that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mediates macrophage inflammatory responses to Pneumocystis and hypothesized that TLR2 deficiency would lead to less severe inflammation and milder lung injury during PcP. Histopathology examination showed that TLR2-/- mice with PcP indeed exhibited milder pulmonary inflammation. TLR2-/- mouse lungs contained less TNF-alpha and displayed lower levels of NF-kappaB activation during PcP. However, TLR2-/- mice with PcP displayed increased severity in symptoms and organism burden. The increased organism burden is likely due to defects in protective mechanisms in TLR2-/- mice. mRNA levels of the inducible nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase p47phox, as well as nitric oxide levels in the lungs, were decreased in TLR2-/- PcP mice. Taken together, this study shows that TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses contribute to a certain degree to the clearance of Pneumocystis organism in mice.",M1
18365995,"Pneumocystis pneumonia.Pneumocystis is an opportunistic fungus that is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. Despite a decline in incidence with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Pneumocystis remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is an increasing cause of disease in patients with other forms of immunosuppression. Although there have been advances in the prevention and treatment of this infection, the mortality for Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in the setting of AIDS remains 10 to 20%. The mortality for patients with other forms of immunosuppression is poorly defined but may actually be higher than that reported in the setting of AIDS. The continued severity of PCP in the AIDS population, its increasing frequency in other immunosuppressed populations, and increasing evidence that normal hosts may serve as a reservoir for the organism merit continued evaluation of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this infection.",M1
18360286,"Second-line salvage treatment of AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: a case series and systematic review.BACKGROUND: Limited clinical data exist to guide the choice of second-line salvage treatment for AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). METHODS: We did a systematic search of MEDLINE for all randomized and observational studies of PCP treatment published up to August 2007 and included individual treatment data of AIDS-associated PCP from a tricenter study. We calculated pooled estimates of reported outcome of second-line treatment using averaged odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies with sufficient detail of second-line treatment and outcome, including data from 82 individual cases from the tricenter study, yielded a total of 468 PCP second-line treatment episodes. Response rates to second-line treatment were comparable for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; 68%) and clindamycin-primaquine (73%) (OR for response = 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 3.2] and 2.7 [95% CI: 1.3 to 4.0], respectively) but were considerably lower for intravenous pentamidine (44%; OR = 0.8 [95% CI: 0.6 to 1.0]). CONCLUSIONS: Clindamycin-primaquine is an alternative to intravenous pentamidine as second-line treatment for PCP in patients who fail treatment with TMP-SMX. TMP-SMX should be used as a second-line treatment for those failing first-line treatments with regimens other than TMP-SMX.",M1
18306977,"Asymptomatic carriage of Pneumocystis jiroveci in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Japan: a possible association between colonization and development of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia during low-dose MTX therapy.Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) has been used effectively for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its favorable risk-benefit ratio. One of the recent concerns arising from this therapy is a possible increase in the rate of opportunistic infections, particularly Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>). In this study, we report two cases of PCP occurring during low-dose methotrexate therapy for RA and review 13 additional cases from the literature on Japanese patients with RA. The average age of these patients was 67.7 years, and most were over the age of 60. MTX-associated PCP appears to occur more frequently in elderly individuals in Japan. To identify individuals with a high risk of PCP, we performed a polymerase chain reaction on specimens from induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from 55 patients with RA. At that point in time, they showed no evidence of PCP development. We found six patients (10.9%) having asymptomatic carriage of P. jiroveci. The mean age of the P. jiroveci-positive patients was 74.7 years, which was significantly older than the P. jiroveci-negative patients (mean age 63.6 years). Of the RA patients over the age of 65, 18.8% (6 cases out of 32) were carriers of P. jiroveci. There were no significant differences in RA duration or counts of white blood cells or lymphocytes between the positive and negative groups. Notably, we encountered a case of PCP occurring in an asymptomatic carrier of P. jiroveci during low-dose MTX therapy for RA. This case appeared to be a reactivation of latent infection. By careful follow-up on the carriers of P. jiroveci, we succeeded in promptly diagnosing PCP, and we employed the appropriate therapeutic strategies for this possibly life-threatening complication.",M1
18304356,"Critical care management and outcome of severe Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with and without HIV infection.BACKGROUND: Little is known about the most severe forms of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) in HIV-negative as compared with HIV-positive patients. Improved knowledge about the differential characteristics and management modalities could guide treatment based on HIV status. METHODS: We retrospectively compared 72 patients (73 cases, 46 HIV-positive) admitted for PCP from 1993 to 2006 in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. RESULTS: The yearly incidence of ICU admissions for PCP in HIV-negative patients increased from 1993 (0%) to 2006 (6.5%). At admission, all but one non-HIV patient were receiving corticosteroids. Twenty-three (85%) HIV-negative patients were receiving an additional immunosuppressive treatment. At admission, HIV-negative patients were significantly older than HIV-positive patients (64 [18 to 82] versus 37 [28 to 56] years old) and had a significantly higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II (38 [13 to 90] versus 27 [11 to 112]) but had a similar PaO2/FiO2 (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio (160 [61 to 322] versus 183 [38 to 380] mm Hg). Ventilatory support was required in a similar proportion of HIV-negative and HIV-positive cases (78% versus 61%), with a similar proportion of first-line non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (67% versus 54%). NIV failed in 71% of HIV-negative and in 13% of HIV-positive patients (p &lt; 0.01). Mortality was significantly higher in HIV-negative than HIV-positive cases (48% versus 17%). The HIV-negative status (odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 12.60) and SAPS II (odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.12) were independently associated with mortality at multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The yearly incidence of ICU admissions for PCP in HIV-negative patients in our unit increased from 1993 to 2006. The course of the disease and the outcome were worse in HIV-negative patients. NIV often failed in HIV-negative cases, suggesting that NIV must be watched closely in this population.",M1
18259974,"Pneumocystis: a novel pathogen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in significant morbidity and mortality. Smoking has long been recognized as the primary risk factor for development of COPD, but factors determining the severity or pattern of disease in smokers are largely unknown. Recent interest has focused on the potential role of infectious agents and the associated host response in accelerating progression of airway obstruction or in perpetuating its progression following discontinuation of tobacco exposure. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. Recent evidence has linked this organism with COPD. Using sensitive molecular techniques, low levels of Pneumocystis have been detected in the respiratory tract of certain individuals and termed colonization. Several findings support the theory that colonization with Pneumocystis is involved in the  vicious circle  hypothesis of COPD in which colonization with organisms perpetuates an inflammatory and lung remodeling response. Pneumocystis colonization is more prevalent in smokers and in those with severe COPD. The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs, even at low levels, produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD, with increases in numbers of neutrophils and CD8(+) lymphocytes. HIV-infected subjects who have had <e>PCP</e> develop permanent airway obstruction, and HIV-infected patients have a high prevalence of both emphysema and Pneumocystis colonization. In addition, a non-human primate model of colonization shows development of airway obstruction and radiographic emphysema. Additional studies are needed to confirm the role of Pneumocystis in the pathogenesis of COPD, given that this agent might be a treatable co-factor in disease progression.",M1
18248760,"Host-microbe interplay in persistent Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in HIV patients.It has been shown that persistent Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage results in increased bacterial dispersal and a higher risk of infection compared to non-or-intermittent S. aureus carriage. Although many studies investigated S. aureus nasal carriage in HIV patients, none compared persistent carriage to non-persistent carriage nor were studies performed in the HAART era. We investigated the host-microbe interplay of persistent S. aureus nasal carriage in HIV-infected patients by studying host determinants of persistent carriage as well as the genetic structure of S. aureus strains isolated. We compared this genetic structure with the previously determined population structure of S. aureus isolates obtained from healthy individuals. Between February 2004 and June 2005 all HIV patients visiting the outpatient department of Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) were asked to participate in this study. Participants were interviewed and screened for persistent S. aureus carriage using two semi-quantitative nasal swab cultures. For 443 patients two cultures were available, 131 (29.6%) were persistent carriers, which is significantly higher as compared to healthy individuals from the same geographic region (17.6%; P&lt;0.0001). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-3.73), current smoking (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) prophylaxis (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.97) and antiretroviral therapy (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.98) were independent determinants of persistent carriage. Only two strains were mecA positive (1.2%) and no PVL positive strains were detected. The population structure of S. aureus strains isolated from HIV patients appeared to be strongly overlapping with that of S. aureus isolates from healthy individuals.",M1
18216217,"Molecular evidence of nosocomial Pneumocystis jirovecii transmission among 16 patients after kidney transplantation.In recent years, clusters of Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) among immunocompromised individuals have been reported. Mostly, the source of infections was suspected to be within the clinical settings when transplant recipients and PCP patients shared hospital facilities. We report on a cluster of 16 renal transplant recipients positive for P. jirovecii. None of them received anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis prior to P. jirovecii detection. Epidemiological studies revealed that 15 of them had received kidney transplants at a German university hospital and attended the same inpatient and outpatient clinic from January through September 2006. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on the following genes: ITS1, beta-tub, 26S, and mt26S. P. jirovecii DNA was available from 14 patients and showed identical MLST types among these renal transplant recipients. Surprisingly, one patient who was treated at a different nephrological center and reported no personal contact with patients from the renal transplantation cluster harbored an identical P. jirovecii MLST type. Three HIV-positive patients and one bone-marrow-transplanted hematologic malignancy patient--treated at different medical centers--were used as controls, and different MLST types were revealed. Interestingly, in three of the four previously described regions, new alleles were detected, and one new polymorphism was observed in the mt26S region. The epidemiological data and the genotyping results strongly suggest a nosocomial patient-to-patient transmission of P. jirovecii as the predominant transmission route. Therefore, strict segregation and isolation of P. jirovecii-positive/suspected patients in clinical settings seems warranted.",M1
18190281,"Early predictors of mortality from Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients: 1985-2006.BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) remains the leading cause of opportunistic infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. Previous studies of PCP that identified case-fatality risk factors involved small numbers of patients, were performed over few years, and often focused on patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify case-fatality risk factors present at or soon after hospitalization among adult HIV-infected patients admitted to University College London Hospitals (London, United Kingdom) from June 1985 through June 2006. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a review of case notes for 494 consecutive patients with 547 episodes of laboratory-confirmed PCP. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 13.5%. Mortality was 10.1% for the period from 1985 through 1989, 16.9% for the period from 1990 through June 1996, and 9.7% for the period from July 1996 through 2006 (P = .142). Multivariate analysis identified factors associated with risk of death, including increasing patient age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.23; P = .011), subsequent episode of PCP (AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.14-4.52; P = .019), low hemoglobin level at hospital admission (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83; P &lt; .001), low partial pressure of oxygen breathing room air at hospital admission (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.81; P &lt; .001), presence of medical comorbidity (AOR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.77-8.72; P = .001), and pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (AOR, 6.95; 95% CI, 2.26-21.37; P = .001). Patients with a first episode of PCP were sicker (mean partial pressure of oxygen at admission +/- standard deviation, 9.3+/-2.0 kPa) than those with a second or third episode of PCP (mean partial pressure of oxygen at admission +/- standard deviation, 9.9+/-1.9 kPa; P = .008), but mortality among patients with a first episode of PCP (12.5%) was lower than mortality among patients with subsequent episodes of PCP (22.5%) (P = .019). No patient was receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy before presentation with PCP, and none began highly active antiretroviral therapy during treatment of PCP. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk factors for PCP were identifiable at or soon after hospitalization. The trend towards improved outcome after June 1996 occurred in the absence of highly active antiretroviral therapy.",M1
18177224,"S-adenosylmethionine levels in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection.BACKGROUND: S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a key molecule involved in methylation reactions and polyamine synthesis. Pneumocystis carinii are unable to synthesize this molecule and have been shown to scavenge this metabolic intermediate from the plasma of rats during active infection. A prior study involving humans strongly suggested that low levels of plasma AdoMet are sensitive and specific indicators of acute infection. METHODS: From March 2004 through January 2006, we collected plasma AdoMet levels from patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and either confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>), confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis, or confirmed bacterial pneumonia. We compared levels in patients with PCP with those in patients with other diseases and also monitored changes in levels during treatment of PCP. RESULTS: Initial AdoMet levels were significantly lower in patients with PCP, and there was no overlap between the groups. Among patients with PCP, levels of AdoMet increased with successful treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of plasma AdoMet levels in patients with HIV infection who have pulmonary infections can identify those with PCP.",M1
18175999,"Preventive effect of sulfamethoxasole-trimethoprim on Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with interstitial pneumonia.BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is a potentially fatal complication in interstitial pneumonia patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy. Prophylaxis of PCP during glucocorticoid therapy is an important issue in the treatment of interstitial pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the prophylactic effect of sulfamethoxasole-trimethoprim (TMP-SMX) in interstitial pneumonia patients receiving glucocorticoids. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 74 interstitial pneumonia patients who received glucocorticoid therapy. RESULTS: Seven of the 74 patients developed PCP. At the time of diagnosis of PCP, the mean duration of glucocorticoid therapy was 71 days and the mean daily dose of prednisolone was 37 mg. Among the 7 patients, the circulating CD4+ lymphocyte count was 370 /microl on average and it was over 200 /microl in 3 cases. The PCP patients showed a significant reduction of the lymphocyte count at 4 weeks after initiation of steroid therapy. None of the patients who received prophylactic TMP-SMX therapy developed PCP even if the CD4+ lymphocyte count was less than 200 /microl. CONCLUSION: Interstitial pneumonia patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy can benefit from TMP-SMX prophylaxis against PCP. Development of PCP cannot be ruled out in patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of greater than 200 /microl.",M1
19571493,"Evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia.The aim of this study was to evaluate of the quantification of Pneumocystis jiroveci using a real-time PCR assay. We tried to verify whether quantification was really effective in differentiating between carriage and Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) using real-time PCR with or without sample species normalization for classifying each sample species (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage: bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and total samples). Twenty-two positive samples previously examined by conventional qualitative PCR were subjected to real-time PCR. Of these 22 lower respiratory tract specimens, 10 were BAL samples and 12 were (induced) sputum samples. According to our clinical diagnostic criteria, 17 were PCP and 5 were non-PCP. In the 12 sputum samples the concentrations of Pneumocystis-specific DNA detected in the non-PCP patients did not differ significantly from those in the PCP patients. The data were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the housekeeping gene to exclude differences due to the number of human cells in collected samples. After normalization, the Pneumocystis-specific DNA/GAPDH-DNA ratio in the non-PCP patients was higher than that in the PCP patients. In the BAL samples (10 samples), the mean concentration of Pneumocystis-specific DNA detected in the PCP patients was 9.6 times higher than that in the non-PCP patients (P=0.058), and after normalization, the Pneumocystis-specific DNA/GAPDH-DNA ratio in the PCP patients did not differ significantly (P=0.19) from that in the non-PCP patients. Although the present study indicated that normalization using GAPDH might be not helpful but BAL specimens are recommended over sputum specimens for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis Pneumonia by quantification with real-time PCR.",M1

18065667,"Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for diagnosing Pneumocystis pneumonia.Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel, rapid nucleic acid amplification method with high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal conditions. In this study a LAMP assay for diagnosing Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) was developed. Oligonucleotide primers specific for Pneumocystis species were designed corresponding to 18S rRNA gene sequences. The assay, performed for 30 min at 61 degrees C, was capable of detecting 50 copies per tube (2 x 10(3) copies ml(-1)) in 30 min and did not show cross-reactivity to other species of fungi, including the genera Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. A total of 21 of 24 clinical specimens (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) from patients with suspected PCP tested positive using the LAMP assay by real-time fluorescence detection. The results of the LAMP reaction were also observed by real-time turbidity detection and end-point visual turbidity or fluorescence detection. With real-time fluorescence detection, melting curves of the products were effective at distinguishing specific amplification from non-specific amplification or self-amplification. Visual detection was also possible as a rapid and easy assay using only a heat block and a black light.",M1

METHODS: P. carinii pneumonia (<e>PcP</e>) rat models were established by subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone for 14 weeks. Total RNA was extracted from lung of P. carinii rat and p55 antigen gene fragment was cloned by RT-PCR, which was identified by sequencing. The 690 bp fragment was cloned to pGEX-4T-1, the recombinant plasmid was screened and identified by restriction analysis and PCR. The recombinant plasmid was finally induced with IPTG to express a new fusion protein, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. RESULTS: A fragment of 690 bp was obtained by RT-PCR. The recombinant pGEX-4T-1/690 was constructed. SDS-PAGE revealed that the molecular weight of the recombinant protein was approximately Mr 62,000, the maximum amount of the fusion protein produced was 11.6% of the total protein.

METHODS: Wistar rats were injected intramuscularly continually with dexamethasone to establish the rat model of PCP. The experimental rats (group A) were injected intramuscularly with garlicin at a dose of 10 mg/(kg x d) for 5 days in the 3rd, 6th and 9th week respectively, and SMZ/TMP therapy group (B), PCP infected group (C) and normal group (D) were established as controls. Three days after the last treatment, the rats of all groups were killed and BALF was collected without contamination and enzymes AST, ALF, CHE, ALP, LDH, CK, CKMB, HBDH, AFU, 5'NT, ADA were examined. RESULTS: The ALP level in group C [(573.41 +/- 350.63)U/L] was significantly higher than that in group D [(210.56 +/- 114.41) U/L] (q = 4.682, P &lt; 0.01), group A [(392.07 +/- 217.57) U/L] (q = 3.851, P &lt; 0.05), and group B [(325.21 +/- 180.65) U/L] (q = 4.380, P &lt; 0.01); the level of CK, CKMB and 5'NT in group C [948.94 +/- 403.43, 489.47 +/- 254.46 and (6.76 +/- 3.11) U/L respectively] was higher than those in group D [426.22 +/- 319.00, 213.33 +/- 144.54 and (3.22 +/- 1.20) U/L] (q = 4.696, 3.784, 3.812, P&lt; 0.05); there was no significant difference in the level of AST, ALT, CHE, LDH, HBDH, AFU and ADA among the four groups (F = 1.852, 0.958, 2.470, 1.423, 1.178, 1.342, 0.611, P &gt; 0.05).

18024536,"Pneumocystis colonisation is common among hospitalised HIV infected patients with non-Pneumocystis pneumonia.BACKGROUND: When Pneumocystis DNA is recovered from respiratory specimens of patients without Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>), patients are said to be colonised with Pneumocystis, although the significance of this state is unknown. Understanding risk factors for and outcomes of colonisation may provide insights into the life cycle and transmission dynamics of Pneumocystis jirovecii. METHODS: We performed a cross sectional study of the prevalence and clinical predictors of Pneumocystis colonisation in 172 HIV infected, PCP negative inpatients undergoing diagnostic evaluation of 183 episodes of pneumonia at either the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans between 2003 and 2005 or San Francisco General Hospital between 2000 and 2005. DNA was extracted from sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens and amplified using a nested PCR assay at the mitochondrial large subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA locus. Colonisation was deemed present if Pneumocystis DNA was identified by both gel electrophoresis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: 68% (117/172) of all patients were colonised with Pneumocystis. No strong associations with colonisation were identified for any demographic factors. Among clinical factors, having a CD4+ T cell count &lt;/=50 cells/mul (unadjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.48; p = 0.031) and using PCP prophylaxis (unadjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; p = 0.077) were associated with Pneumocystis colonisation, although the latter association may have been due to chance. After adjustment for CD4+ T cell count, use of PCP prophylaxis was associated with a decreased odds of colonisation (adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98; p = 0.045). 11 patients who were colonised were subsequently readmitted for evaluation of a second episode of pneumonia; three were found to be colonised again, but none had PCP. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospitalised HIV infected patients with non-PCP pneumonia are colonised with Pneumocystis. Failure to use co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and severe immunosuppression are associated with an increase in the odds of colonisation. Pneumocystis colonisation among hospitalised patients does not commonly lead to PCP.",M1

17934116,"Clinical picture of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is common in patients with HIV infection but may also occur in patients with other causes of immunodeficiency, including hematologic and solid malignancies. METHODS: To better describe the clinical picture of PCP as to maintain a high level of suspicion in adequate cases, we studied 56 cancer patients with PCP and compared them to 56 cancer patients with bacterial pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 56 PCP patients, 44 patients (78.6%) had hematologic malignancies (18 recipients of bone marrow transplantation) and 12 patients had solid tumors. The time since diagnosis was 24 months (range, 4 to 49 months). All patients with solid tumors and 20 patients (45.4%) with hematologic malignancies were receiving steroids. Only six patients were receiving PCP prophylaxis. The main symptoms were fever (85.7%), dyspnea (78.6%), and cough (57.1%). Time from symptom onset was 7 days (range, 3 to 14 days). PCP presented as severe pneumonia (Pao(2), 58 mm Hg [range, 50 to 70 mm Hg]) with bilateral interstitial infiltrates (80.4%) and bilateral ground-glass attenuation (89.3%) by CT. Of the 24 ICU patients (42.9%), 16 patients (19.6%) required mechanical ventilation. Eleven patients (19.6%) died. Compared to 56 patients with bacterial pneumonia, PCP patients were more likely to have non-Hodgkin lymphoma and be receiving long-term steroids; they had longer times since diagnosis, longer symptom duration, higher frequencies of fever and of diffuse lung disease (diffuse crackles, bilateral infiltrates, and hypoxemia), higher frequency of ground-glass opacities, and lower frequency of pleural involvement. CONCLUSIONS: PCP presents as subacute, febrile, hypoxemic, and diffuse pulmonary involvement in patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies receiving long-term steroids.",M1
17927302,"Management of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in children receiving chemotherapy.Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia (<e>PCP</e>) is a serious opportunistic infection in children and adolescents with cancer. It was the most common cause of death among children receiving chemotherapy prior to the inclusion of PCP prophylaxis as part of standard care for children with leukemia. The incidence of PCP has decreased significantly since initiation of prophylaxis; however, breakthrough cases continue to occur. Hematologic malignancies, brain tumors necessitating prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, and lymphopenia are the most important risk factors for PCP in children not infected with HIV. Of children with leukemia, 15-20% may develop PCP in the absence of prophylaxis. Infection with P. jiroveci occurs early in life in most individuals. However, clinically apparent disease occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised persons. Dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever are the most common presenting symptoms of PCP. Chest radiography and high-resolution CT scans of the chest demonstrate a characteristic ground-glass pattern. Induced sputum analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage are the diagnostic procedures of choice. Gomori's methenamine-silver stain, Geimsa or Wright's stain, and monoclonal immunofluorescent antibody stains are most commonly used to make a diagnosis. However, identification of P. jiroveci DNA using polymerase chain reaction assays in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is more sensitive. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ; cotrimoxazole) is the recommended drug for the treatment of PCP. Patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMZ or who have not responded to treatment after 5-7 days of therapy with TMP-SMZ should be treated with pentamidine. A short course of corticosteroids is recommended for moderate to severe cases of PCP within the first 72 hours after diagnosis. Mutations in the dihydropteroate synthetase gene may confer resistance to TMP-SMZ; however, the clinical relevance of these mutations is not well established. TMP-SMZ is the most commonly used agent for prophylaxis. Myelosuppression is the most important adverse effect of TMP-SMZ and the most frequent cause for choosing alternative prophylactic agents in children undergoing chemotherapy. Alternative agents for chemoprophylaxis include dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, and atovaquone. Alternative prophylactic agents must be used in patients developing myelosuppression secondary to TMP-SMZ or dapsone.",M1
20299071,"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in blood and breast milk samples from residents of a schistosomiasis area with Na-<e>PCP</e> application in China.Schistosomiasis has prevailed in some areas of China for a long time. Chinese technical sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-PCP) has been used to control the spread of snail-borne schistosomiasis since the 1960s. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), impurities contained in the Na-PCP, enter the soil and may accumulate in the food chain. In order to evaluate their potentially harmful effects on local residents, 50 breast milk samples and 20 blood samples were collected in 2004 from residents in the Dongting Lake area, one of China's known schistosomiasis areas. Levels of 17 PCDD/F congeners were measured in all samples, and DNA damage was simultaneously assessed in blood samples. The PCDD/F congener distribution patterns in human tissue samples from the Dongting Lake area were similar to those in Na-PCP, and the octachlorodibenzodioxin (OCDD) congener was predominant in all samples. We also had a primary investigation that the breast milk WHO-TEQ associated with some factors such as: age, dietary habit, body mass index (BMI) and the total menses times. In blood samples, the samples with higher OCDD level had higher DDS (DNA damage score) values than those samples with low OCDD level, which indicated that the higher DNA damage value in general population might be caused directly or indirectly by PCDD/Fs. The results also indicated that the WHO-TEQ values in blood were associated with age (r=0.6, p=0.007).",M2
20218544,"Evaluation of the potential of pentachlorophenol degradation in soil by pulsed corona discharge plasma from soil characteristics.Chlorinated organics are frequently found as harmful soil contaminants and persisted for extended periods of time. A novel approach, named pulsed corona discharge plasma (PCDP), was employed for the degradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in soil. Experimental results showed that 87% of PCP could be smoothly removed in 60 min. Increasing pulse voltage, enhancing soil pH, lowering humic acid (HA) in soil and reducing granular size of the soil were found to be favorable for PCP degradation efficiency. Oxidation and physical processes simultaneously contributed to PCP removal in soil and ozone was the main factor in PCDP treatment. C-Cl bonds in PCP were cleaved during PCDP treatment by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The mineralization of PCP was confirmed by total organic carbon (TOC) and dechlorination analyses. The main intermediate products such as tetrachlorocatechol, tetrachlorohydroquinone, acetic acid, formic acid, and oxalic acid were identified by HPLC/MS and ion chromatography. A possible pathway of PCP degradation in soil in such a system was proposed.",M2

The effects of the milling time and additives on the dechlorination rate were investigated. The resulting product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and ion chromatography (IC). It is found that grinding operation could dechlorinate PCP, with the formation of inorganic chloride and amorphous carbon. The addition of quartz to the grinding mixture facilitated dechlorination. On the basis of the experimental results, the decomposition mechanism was proposed. Decomposition predominantly proceeds through rupture of C-Cl bond in PCP molecule, followed by the formation of inorganic chlorides.",M2

The influence of humic acid (HA) type on the catalytic oxidation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) was investigated using two HAs as follows: Shinshinotsu peat (SHA) with a lower carboxylic acid content; Tohro ando soil (THA) with a higher carboxylic acid content. The levels of PCP degradation and dechlorination for the catalysts prepared using SHA (SHA-FeTHP) and THA (THA-FeTHP) were significantly higher than those for FeTHP. In terms of oxidation products, the more toxic dimer, octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), was not produced in the case of the SHA-FeTHP system, while 4-7% of the PCP was converted to OCDD when the FeTHP and THA-FeTHP catalytic systems were used. These results indicate that a catalyst prepared using SHA is more active, in terms of the detoxification of PCP, than other catalysts. Comparisons of UV-Vis absorption spectra before and after the catalytic oxidation showed that the Soret band for SHA-FeTHP clearly remained after a 30-min incubation period, while the intensity of the majority of Soret bands for FeTHP and THA-FeTHP were rapidly reduced after a 5-min incubation period. These results suggest that the SHA-FeTHP is a stable catalyst, and this stability results in a more extensive oxidation of the more toxic byproducts.",M2

The catalytic system, which included the synthesized catalyst (resol) and an oxygen donor (KHSO(5)), was applied to the oxidative degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TrCP) and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in contaminated soil suspensions. The optimal conditions (catalyst, KHSO(5) and substrate concentrations) were investigated. In both FeTPP(OH)(4) and resol catalytic systems, more than 95% of TrCP (100 microM) and PCP (25 microM) degraded at pH 4, [catalyst] 20 microM and [KHSO(5)] 1 mM. When initial concentrations of TrCP and PCP were increased to [TrCP](0) 200 micro M and [PCP](0) 50 micro M, the percent degradation of the CPs and the levels of dechlorination in the resol catalytic system were significantly greater than the values obtained using the FeTPP(OH)(4) system. These results show that the synthesized resol catalyst effectively enhances oxidative degradation of TrCP and PCP in contaminated soil suspensions. The resol catalysts adsorbed to contaminated soils were at levels that were significantly greater than those of FeTPP(OH)(4). Therefore, the enhanced degradation of CPs by resol catalysts can be attributed to the interactions between adsorbed CPs on the soil surface and the catalytic center of the resol catalysts.",M2
19822198,"Effect of pentachlorophenol and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol on the activity of cDNA-expressed human alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP), potent inhibitors of phenol sulphotransferases, are frequently used in animal studies to elucidate the role of these enzymes in the biotransformation and toxicity of xenobiotics. An unexpected finding with 1-hydroxymethylpyrene--a strong decrease in the excretion of the corresponding carboxylic acid in rats concurrently treated with PCP-led us to suspect that this sulphotransferase inhibitor may also affect alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and/or aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Subsequently we investigated the influence of PCP and DCNP on the activity of cDNA-expressed human ADHs and ALDHs. PCP inhibited all four ADHs studied. The inhibition was strong for ADH3 (K(i) 1.4 microM, K(i)' 5.2 microM, mixed-type) and ADH2 (K(i) 3.7 microM, competitive), but moderate for ADH4 (K(i) 81 microM, competitive) and ADH1C (K(i)' 310 microM, uncompetitive). Activities of ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 were unaffected by PCP (used up to a concentration of 1 mM). In contrast, DCNP primarily inhibited ALDH2 (K(i)=K(i)' 7.4 microM, non-competitive), showed moderate competitive inhibition of ADH2 (K(i) 160 microM) and ADH4 (K(i) 710 microM), but did not affect the remaining enzymes (ADH1C, ADH3 and ALDH3A1).

19800731,"Extraction of pentachlorophenol from soils using environmentally benign lactic acid solutions.Soil contamination with pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) is widespread across the globe. Soil washing/extraction is a common technique to remove this compound. Several soil washing/extraction solutions have been used but a majority of them have the problem of persistence in the environment due to their low biodegradability. Our aim was to investigate mixed solutions of lactic acid and water as potential alternatives to surfactant solutions or organic solvent systems used for the removal of PCP from three soils: montmorillonite, a natural sediment (with organic matter), and the same sediment without organic matter (ignited sediment). This study included the optimization of the concentration of lactic acid in water for maximum extraction efficiency and the determination of linear desorption constants for removal of PCP from the three soils with lactic acid. The effect of soil/sediment organic matter on the extraction efficiency was also studied. Initial experiments showed that 24h was the optimum extraction time. High extraction efficiencies were obtained for montmorillonite (40-80%) and ignited sediment ( approximately 90%). The natural sediment exhibited low PCP extraction due to presence of organic matter, while high desorption coefficient values ( approximately 23 L/kg) were obtained for the ignited sediment. For all soils, a decrease in extraction was observed at higher concentrations of lactic acid. The specific surface area of soil/sediment was also found to be an important factor affecting the extraction of PCP.",M2

The main intermediates of PCP degradation were identified by GC-MS, HPLC and IC analyses. It was found that the cycling process between Fe(III) and Fe(II) in both the goethite and hematite systems occurred more vigorously at the initial stage and gradually became gentle, while the rate of PCP photodegradation varied from fast to slow during the reaction time. Furthermore, the formation of H(2)O(2) during photoreaction was studied to explore its relationship with the photodegradation efficiency and the iron cycling process.",M2
19786897,"Mortality rates among workers exposed to dioxins in the manufacture of pentachlorophenol.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if workers exposed to dioxins in pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) manufacturing were at increased risk of death from specific causes. METHODS: We examined death rates among 773 workers exposed to chlorinated dioxins during PCP manufacturing from 1937 to 1980 using serum dioxin evaluations to estimate exposures to five dioxins. RESULTS: Deaths from all causes combined, all cancers combined, lung cancer, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease were near expected levels. There were eight deaths from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (standardized mortality ratios = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0 to 4.8). We observed no trend of increasing risk for any cause of death with increasing dioxin exposure. However, the highest rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were found in the highest exposure group (standardized mortality ratios = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.5). CONCLUSIONS: Other than possibly an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we find no other cause of death related to the mixture of the dioxin contaminants found in PCP.",M2
19683864,"EPR detection of hydroxyl radical generation and its interaction with antioxidant system in Carassius auratus exposed to pentachlorophenol.In the present study, direct evidence of hydroxyl radical production in livers of Carassius auratus exposed to pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) was provided using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with spin-trapping. A dose-effect relationship was obtained between hydroxyl radical intensities and PCP exposure. It was observed that hydroxyl radical was significantly induced by 0.001 mg l(-1) (below the criteria for Chinese fishery water quality) of PCP exposure. A strong positive correlation (r=0.9581, p&lt;0.001) was observed between PCP liver concentrations and hydroxyl radical intensities within 7d of PCP exposure, which suggests that hydroxyl radical are mainly produced from PCP itself. However, no correlation was observed between PCP liver concentrations and hydroxyl radical intensities after 7d, and a higher intensity of hydroxyl radical could still be observed when the PCP liver concentrations decreased to a lower level, which suggests that other mechanisms may possibly contribute to hydroxyl radical production after 7d. The glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio decreased below that of the control level during the entire period of PCP exposure (0.05 mg l(-1)), which suggested oxidative stress occurred.",M2
19683343,"Bioaccumulation and biotransformation of brominated and chlorinated contaminants and their metabolites in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from East Greenland.We report on the comparative bioaccumulation, biotransformation and/or biomagnification from East Greenland ringed seal (Pusa hispida) blubber to polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues (adipose, liver and brain) of various classes and congeners of persistent chlorinated and brominated contaminants and metabolic by-products: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (CHLs), hydroxyl (OH-) and methylsulfonyl (MeSO(2)-) PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), OH-PBBs, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) flame retardants and OH- and methoxyl (MeO-) PBDEs, 2,2-dichloro-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethene (p,p'-DDE), 3-MeSO(2)-p,p'-DDE, pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and 4-OH-heptachlorostyrene (4-OH-HpCS). We detected all of the investigated contaminants in ringed seal blubber with high frequency, the main diet of East Greenland bears, with the exception of OH-PCBs and 4-OH-HpCS, which indicated that these phenolic contaminants were likely of metabolic origin and formed in the bears from accumulated PCBs and octachlorostyrene (OCS), respectively, rather than being bioaccumulated from a seal blubber diet. For all of the detectable sum of classes or individual organohalogens, in general, the ringed seal to polar bear mean BMFs for SigmaPCBs, p,p'-DDE, SigmaCHLs, SigmaMeSO(2)-PCBs, 3-MeSO(2)-p,p'-DDE, PCP, SigmaPBDEs, total-(alpha)-HBCD, SigmaOH-PBDEs, SigmaMeO-PBDEs and SigmaOH-PBBs indicated that these organohalogens bioaccumulate, and in some cases there was tissue-specific biomagnification, e.g., BMFs for bear adipose and liver ranged from 2 to 570. The blood-brain barrier appeared to be effective in minimizing brain accumulation as BMFs were &lt;or=1 in the brain, with the exception of SigmaOH-PBBs (mean BMF=93+/-54). Unlike OH-PCB metabolites, OH-PBDEs in the bear tissues appeared to be mainly accumulated from the seal blubber rather than being metabolic formed from PBDEs in the bears. In vitro PBDE depletion assays using polar bear hepatic microsomes, wherein the rate of oxidative metabolism of PBDE congeners was very slow, supported the probability that accumulation from seals is the main source of OH-PBDEs in the bear tissues. Our findings demonstrated from ringed seal to polar bears that organohalogen biotransformation, bioaccumulation and/or biomagnification varied widely and depended on the contaminant in question. Our results show the increasing complexity of bioaccumulated and in some cases biomagnified, chlorinated and brominated contaminants and/or metabolites from the diet may be a contributing stress factor in the health of East Greenland polar bears.",M2
19680897,"Pentachlorophenol, polychlorodibenzodioxin and polychlorodibenzofuran in eggs from hens exposed to contaminated wood shavings.Laying hens may be exposed to pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) present in bedding materials derived from treated timber. As a result, this chemical and its contaminants or degradation products, such as polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), may be present in eggs. The litter-to-eggs transfer and depletion of these compounds were studied in a flock of laying hens reared on contaminated wood shavings. PCP determination was carried out via high resolution gas chromatography coupled to low resolution mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HRGC-LRMS/MS); PCDDs and PCDFs were quantified by HRGC-HRMS (SIM). After substitution of the litter contaminated with PCDDs and PCDFs at an average of 50 pg WHO-TE g(-1) and with PCP at 15 microg g(-1), pooled eggs from six selected hens were sampled twice a month for the depletion study. At steady state, PCDDs and PCDFs showed a transfer ratio of 0.9; for PCP it was 0.03. PCP concentration in eggs (500 ng g(-1) whole weight) fell sharply the second week after exposure withdrawal; for PCDDs and PCDFs (47 pg WHO-TE g(-1) fat, at day 0), the overall TEQ half-life was estimated at an average of 3.8 weeks. Due to differences in toxicokinetics (a faster depletion), PCP does not appear to be a suitable marker of PCDD and PCDF violative levels. However, the prominent analytical contribution of H(7)CCD and O(8)CCD in the contamination profile may help to trace the source of contamination. Among congeners, 2,3,7,8 T(4)CDF exhibited a different depletion pattern, indicating a possible mechanism of active transport.",M2
19656621,"Simulataneous pentachlorophenol decomposition and granular activated carbon regeneration assisted by dielectric barrier discharge plasma.An integrated granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption/dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) process was applied to the treatment of high concentration pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) wastewater. The PCP in water firstly was adsorbed onto GAC, and then the degradation of PCP and regeneration of exhausted GAC were simultaneously carried out by DBD. The degradation mechanisms and products of PCP loaded on GAC were analyzed by EDX, FT-IR and GC-MS. The results suggested that the C-Cl bonds in PCP adsorbed by GAC were cleaved by DBD plasma, and some dechlorination and dehydroxylation products were identified. The adsorption capacity of adsorption/DBD treated GAC could maintain relatively high level, which confirmed that DBD treatment regenerated the GAC for subsequent reuse. The adsorption of N2, Boehm titration and XPS were used to investigate detailed surface characterizations of GAC. It could be found that DBD plasma not only increased the BET surface area and pore volume in micropore regions, but also had remarkably impact on the distribution of the oxygen-containing functional groups of GAC.",M2
19634422,"Influence of organic amendments on the sorption of pentachlorophenol on soils.The influence of pH on the sorption of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) onto three organic amendments, char, humic acid (HA) and peat, and the effect of organic amendments on PCP sorption to three kinds of soils were evaluated. The sorption of PCP on these sorbents fitted the Freundlich model well, suggesting that PCP sorption isotherms were nonlinear with exponential coefficient (N) value lower than 1. The PCP sorption capacity on three organic amendments and the N values increased with decreasing pH. The sorption capacities were in the order: char &gt; HA &gt; peat. Organic amendments resulted in an enhancement of sorption capacities of soils. The N values of PCP sorption on soils were decreased by char amendment and increased by HA and peat amendments. This study demonstrated that application of traditional organic amendments led to the enhancement of PCP sorption by soils. This information may aid both in predicting environmental fates of hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds and in developing remediation strategies for them.",M2
19543759,"Screening pentachlorophenol degradation ability by environmental fungal strains belonging to the phyla Ascomycota and Zygomycota.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) bioremediation by the fungal strains amongst the cork-colonising community has not yet been analysed. In this paper, the co- and direct metabolism of PCP by each of the 17 fungal species selected from this community were studied. Using hierarchical data analysis, the isolates were ranked by their PCP bioremediation potential. Fifteen isolates were able to degrade PCP under co-metabolic conditions, and surprisingly Chrysonilia sitophila, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Mucor plumbeus, Penicillium janczewskii and P. glandicola were able to directly metabolise PCP, leading to its complete depletion from media. PCP degradation intermediates are preliminarily discussed. Data emphasise the significance of these fungi to have an interesting potential to be used in PCP bioremediation processes.",M2
19539347,"Bioaccessibility, bioavailability and ecotoxicity of pentachlorophenol in compost amended soils.The influence of compost on the bioaccessibility, bioavailability and ecotoxicity of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) as a function of time was studied by means of different chemical and ecotoxicological methods. Experiments were conducted in both sterile and non-sterile microcosms and samplings carried out at 20, 60 and 120d from initial contamination. PCP bioaccessibility, assessed by means of Porapak resin extraction, was around 75% of the applied dose with no aging or compost effects. Two different methods were applied to assess the bioavailability of PCP, respectively, to bacteria and earthworms and linked to ecotoxicological assays (biosensor and earthworm coelomocytes assays). Water extraction was applied to assess the bioavailability to bacteria: results showed that this fraction was always below 50%, with significant decreases as a result of aging processes and compost addition. In non-sterile microcosms, compost amendment increased the amount of PCP biodegraded, while the ecotoxicological assay with the biosensor Pseudomonas fluorescens pUCD607 indicated a higher toxicity in the most degraded samples, thus suggesting the formation of more toxic metabolites. Earthworm body accumulation results were rather in accordance with water extractions data, with decreasing bioavailable amounts as a result of time and compost addition. No compost or aging effects were instead detected by coelomocytes assay. Results indicate how different methods must be applied altogether to assess the bioavailability and ecotoxicity of xenobiotics such as PCP in soil. The addition of compost was also proven as an effective strategy for the remediation of PCP contaminated soils, although issues related to the possible formation of toxic metabolites must be taken into account.",M2
19490998,"1H NMR to investigate metabolism and energy supply in rhesus macaque sperm.Sperm ATP is derived primarily from either glycolysis or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the present studies, (1)H NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the metabolite profile in primate sperm treated either with alpha-chlorohydrin (ACH), a known inhibitor of sperm glycolysis or pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Sperm were collected from monkeys in the fall and spring, washed and incubated with either the media control, ACH (0.5mM) or PCP (50 microM). Using principal components analysis, PC1 scores plot indicated that the greatest level of variance was found between fall and spring samples and not chemical-treated samples. However, PC4 scores plot did show a consistent effect of ACH treatment. From the PC1 loadings plot, metabolites contributing to the seasonal differences were higher levels of formate in the fall and higher levels of carnitine and acetylcarnitine in the spring as well as possible differences in lipoprotein content. The PC4 loadings plot indicated that ACH treatment decreased lactate and ATP consistent with inhibition of glycolysis. Carnitine also was decreased and acetylcarnitine increased although the latter was not statistically significant. With PCP-treated sperm, no difference between control and treated samples could be discerned suggesting either that primate sperm are insensitive to uncoupling agents or that glycolysis played the more important role in maintaining sperm ATP levels. Overall, NMR studies may prove useful in the development of metabolomic markers that signal sperm metabolic impairments and have the potential to provide useful biomarkers for reproductive health.",M2
19448311,"Electrochemical degradation of pentachlorophenol on a palladium modified gas-diffusion electrode.Pd/C catalyst was prepared by a hydrogen reduction method and used for making a Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode. It was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). In the catalyst, Pd particles with an average size of 4.0 nm were highly dispersed in the activated carbon with an amorphous structure; Pd content on the surface of the Pd/C catalyst reached 1.3 at% (atomic concentration). The Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode was then used as the cathode to investigate the electrochemical degradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in a diaphragm electrolysis device, feeding firstly with hydrogen gas then with air, compared with the carbon/polytetrafluoroethylene (C/PTFE) gas-diffusion cathode. The Pd/C gas-diffusion cathode can not only reductively dechlorinate PCP by feeding hydrogen gas, but also accelerate the two-electron reduction of O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by feeding air. Therefore, both the removal efficiency and the dechlorination degree of PCP exceeded 80% after 100 min, and the average removal efficiency of PCP in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) was more than 75% after 200 min by using Pd/C gas-diffusion cathode, which was better than that of the C/PTFE gas-diffusion cathode. Phenol was identified as the dechorination product using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).",M2
19443213,"Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) dechlorination in horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass (HAIB) reactors.This study verifies the potential applicability of horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass (HAIB) reactors to pentachlorophenol (PCP) dechlorination. Two bench-scale HAIB reactors (R1 and R2) were filled with cubic polyurethane foam matrices containing immobilized anaerobic sludge. The reactors were then continuously fed with synthetic wastewater consisting of PCP, glucose, acetic acid, and formic acid as co-substrates for PCP anaerobic degradation. Before being immobilized in polyurethane foam matrices, the biomass was exposed to wastewater containing PCP in reactors fed at a semi-continuous rate of 2.0 microg PCP g(-1) VS. The applied PCP loading rate was increased from 0.05 to 2.59 mg PCP l(-1)day(-1) for R1, and from 0.06 to 4.15 mg PCP l(-1)day(-1) for R2. The organic loading rates (OLR) were 1.1 and 1.7 kg COD m(-3)day(-1) at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 24h for R1 and 18 h for R2. Under such conditions, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of up to 98% were achieved in the HAIB reactors. Both reactors exhibited the ability to remove 97% of the loaded PCP. Dichlorophenol (DCP) was the primary chlorophenol detected in the effluent. The adsorption of PCP and metabolites formed during PCP degradation in the packed bed was negligible for PCP removal efficiency.",M2
19442831,"Evaluation of pathways involved in pentachlorophenol-induced apoptosis in rat neurons.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) (C(6)HCl(5)O) is a synthetic toxic organochloride fungicide for humans which exhibit neurotoxic properties. In the present research, we describe the potential pathways implicated in PCP-induced apoptosis in an acute model of toxicity in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). In our experiments, acute exposure of CGNs to micromolar concentrations of PCP induced the transcriptional activity of genes related to the classical apoptosis pathway (caspase 3, caspase 8, Bad), oxidative stress and glutathione metabolism (glutathione peroxidase-1, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase-3 and superoxide dismutase-1), and mitogenic response (cyclin D1, cdk2, cdk4, cdkn2b). Results from Western blot also shown significative increases in the expression of cyclins D1, E and A and cdk4. The mitogenic response was also related to a significative increase in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). PCP would cause apoptosis up-regulating the transcriptional activity of p53 gene and also increasing their activation by phosphorylation, concomitant with a decrease in the sirtuin 1 content. In conclusion, acute exposure of CGNs to PCP induces the classical p53 apoptotic pathway, promotes the up-regulation of several genes related to oxidative stress and the over-expression of molecules involved in the cell cycle control.",M2

The results showed that the extractable PCP residues in surface soil in the treatments CK, N, OM and N + OM under non-rice cultivation condition were 28.3, 34.2, 19.3, 18.7 mg/kg after harvesting rice plant, and the extractable PCP residues in subsurface soil were 6.3, 9.1, 5.1, 4.1 mg/kg,respectively. Under rice cultivation condition, the extractable PCP residues in surface soil were 19.4, 30.9, 16.7, 8.7 mg/kg, and the extractable PCP residues in subsurface soil were 3.7, 6.1, 2.6, 2.8 mg/kg, respectively. The results indicated that the long-term application of organic fertilizer or inorganic plus organic fertilizer significantly accelerated the dissipation of PCP in surface soil, and decreased the transportation of PCP down the soil profile. However, long-term application of urea inhibited the dissipation of PCP in surface soil, and increased the transportation of PCP down the soil profile. When compared with non-rice cultivation, rice cultivation significantly accelerated the dissipation of PCP in surface soil other than the treatment N. In addition,the rice cultivation significantly decreased the transportation of PCP down the soil profile. No matter rice was cultivated or not, the dechlorinated metabolites of PCP detected in paddy soil were 2,3,4,5-TeCP and 3,4,5-TCP. 2,3,4,5-TeCP was the major dechlorinated metabolite of PCP under non-rice cultivation condition,whereas 3,4,5-TCP was the major dechlorinated metabolite of PCP under rice cultivation condition.",M2
19410655,"Induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis by pentachlorophenol in primary cultures of Carassius carassius hepatocytes.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) is a highly toxic contaminant of chlorophenols. Due to its slow and incomplete biodegradation, it can be found in surface, groundwater and in soils. To investigate the role of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species in apoptosis induced by PCP in cultured hepatocytes, the primary hepatocytes of Carassius carassius were incubated with different concentrations of PCP at 25 degrees C for 8 h in vitro. Apoptosis was detected by DNA laddering, caspase activation and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that apoptosis was involved in the cytotoxic effect of PCP, and that PCP-induced apoptosis occurred in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the induction of apoptosis by PCP was accompanied with Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity decline, intracellular Ca2+ elevation, generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) disruption and ATP depletion. Concomitantly, there were dose-dependent increases in lipid peroxidation production (MDA) and decreases in glutathione (GSH). These investigations suggest that PCP-induces apoptosis in the cultured hepatocytes by affecting multiple targets, and suggest that [Ca2+]i increase and ROS generation may be involved in apoptosis induction by PCP.",M2
19408893,"Potential mechanism for pentachlorophenol-induced carcinogenicity: a novel mechanism for metal-independent production of hydroxyl radicals.The hydroxyl radical ((*)OH) has been considered to be one of the most reactive oxygen species produced in biological systems. It has been shown that (*)OH can cause DNA, protein, and lipid oxidation. One of the most widely accepted mechanisms for (*)OH production is through the transition metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction. Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) was one of the most widely used biocides, primarily for wood preservation. PCP is now ubiquitously present in our environment and even found in people who are not occupationally exposed to it. PCP has been listed as a priority pollutant by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and classified as a group 2B environmental carcinogen by the International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC). The genotoxicity of PCP has been attributed to its two major quinoid metabolites: tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ). Although the redox cycling of PCP quinoid metabolites to generate reactive oxygen species is believed to play an important role, the exact molecular mechanism underlying PCP genotoxicity is not clear. Using the salicylate hydroxylation assay and electron spin resonance (ESR) secondary spin-trapping methods, we found that (*)OH can be produced by TCBQ and H(2)O(2) independent of transition metal ions. Further studies showed that TCBQ, but not its corresponding semiquinone radical, the tetrachlorosemiquinone radical (TCSQ(*)), is essential for (*)OH production. The major reaction product between TCBQ and H(2)O(2) was identified to be trichloro-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (TrCBQ-OH), and H(2)O(2) was found to be the source and origin of the oxygen atom inserted into this reaction product. On the basis of these data, we propose that (*)OH production by TCBQ and H(2)O(2) is not through a semiquinone-dependent organic Fenton reaction but rather through the following novel mechanism: a nucleophilic attack of H(2)O(2) to TCBQ, leading to the formation of an unstable trichloro-hydroperoxyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TrCBQ-OOH) intermediate, which decomposes homolytically to produce (*)OH. These findings represent a novel mechanism of (*)OH formation not requiring the involvement of redox-active transition metal ions and may partly explain the potential carcinogenicity of the widely used biocides such as PCP and other polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.",M2
19402522,"[Electrochemical degradation of sodium pentachlorophenol on a Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode]Pd/C catalyst was prepared by hydrogen reduction method and used for the Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode. It was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The electrochemical degradation of sodium pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>-Na) was investigated in a diaphragm electrolysis device, feeding firstly with hydrogen gas then with air, using the Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode and the carbon/polytetrafluoroethylene (C/PTFE) gas-diffusion electrode as the cathode, respectively. The results indicate that the two-electron reduction from O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced at the Pd/C gas-diffusion electrode, and the accumulated H2O2 in the cathodic compartment reach to the steady concentration of 9.8 mg/L after 100 min. The Pd/C gas-diffusion cathode can reductively dechlorinate PCP-Na by feeding hydrogen gas, and accelerate the two-electron reduction of O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by feeding air. Therefore, both the removal efficiency and the dechlorination degree of PCP-Na exceed 80% after 100 min, and the average removal efficiency of PCP-Na in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) exceeds 75% after 200 min by using Pd/C gas-diffusion cathode,which is better than that of the C/PTFE gas-diffusion cathode.

19368227,"Endocrine disrupting effects of herbiicides and pentachlorophenol: in vitro and in vivo evidence.The potential for agricultural chemicals to cause endocrine disruption (ED) in humans and wildlife is an increasing concern; however, the effects of commonly used pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations are largely unknown. Therefore, 12 environmentally relevant pesticides (11 herbicides and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>)) were tested for their endocrine disrupting potential in two in vitro assays. A recombinant yeast screen was used to detect receptor mediated (anti-) estrogenic and (anti-) androgenic activity (concentration range: 0.01-1000 microM), and cultured Xenopus oocytes were used to measure effects on the ovulatory response and ovarian steroidogenesis (concentration range: 0.00625-62.5 microM). Eleven pesticides were active in at least one assay (isoproturon, diuron, linuron, 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy acetic acid (MCPA), mecoprop, atrazine, simazine, PCP, trifluralin, chlorpropham, bentazone), and one had no effect (2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4,-D)). The most common effects were antiestrogenic/ antiandrogenic activity in the yeast screen, and inhibition of ovulation in vitro, accompanied by decreased testosterone production. Estrogenic activity was never observed. In addition, the most potent compound identified in vitro (PCP) was tested for ED activity in vivo. A short-term exposure (6 days) of adult female Xenopus to low concentrations (0.1 or 1 microg/L; 0.375 or 3.75 nM) resulted in minor alterations in plasma hormone levels and toxic effects on the ovary. Changes in in vitro human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulated hormone production in ovarian follicles from exposed individuals was also observed. In conclusion, novel effects of herbicides and PCP at environmentally relevant concentrations were found, and the effects of these compounds on humans and/or wildlife warrant further investigation.",M2
19365804,"Inducibility of metallothionein biosynthesis in the whole soft tissue of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha exposed to cadmium, copper, and pentachlorophenol.Freshwater mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) were exposed to the elevated concentrations of Cd (10, 50, 100, and 500 microg/L), Cu (10, 30, 50, and 80 microg/L), and an organochlorinated pesticide, pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) (1, 10, and 100 microg/L). Induced synthesis of biomarker metallothionein (MT) and changes in concentrations of cytosolic Cd, Cu, and Zn in the whole soft tissue of mussels were monitored after a 7-day laboratory exposure to the contaminants. A clear dose-dependent elevation in the MT concentration was observed after exposure to Cd at doses of 10-100 microg/L, and this increase of MT content was accompanied with a linear increase of cytosolic Cd. Cd concentration of 500 microg/L caused no additional increase of MT and Cd in mussel cytosol, suggesting possible toxic effects due to exceeding cellular inducible/defense capacity. Cu exposure resulted with variable changes in MT concentrations, with no clear linear relationship between MT and Cu concentrations in water, although a progressive dose-dependent accumulation of Cu in the soluble fraction of mussel tissues was recorded. A decrease of cytosolic Zn was evident at higher exposure concentrations of both metals used. PCP in concentrations applied was unable to induce MT synthesis, but the higher concentrations of PCP influenced the cytosolic metal concentrations. In conclusion, the results obtained confirm the specificity of MT induction in D. polymorpha as an biological response on metal stimulation, especially by cadmium, being more closely correlated to MT than copper within the ecologically relevant concentration range. The strong induction potential of cadmium as well as an absence of MT induction following exposure to PCP as an organic chemical contaminant are supporting evidences for usage of zebra mussel MT as a specific biomarker of Cd exposure in biomonitoring programs.",M2

Peroxidases, such as lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase, as well as laccases are mainly produced by basidiomycetes and to a lower extent by other fungi, such as ascomycetes. Peroxidase-encoding genes have been described and homologous expression has been achieved in basidiomycetes. Heterologous expression has also been achieved in some non-producing peroxidase ascomycetes, like Penicillium and Aspergillus. In this work, heterologous expression of peroxidase-encoding genes, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase was achieved in a zygomycete producing only phenoloxidases (Amylomyces rouxii), aimed at coupling two different pathways used in nature for PCP removal in only one microbial strain. The ability of PCP removal was assayed with one of the obtained transformants, resulting in increased activity with respect to the ability of the parental strain cultured free of the inducer tyrosine (95% and 45%, respectively, of the initial PCP (12.5 mg L(-1)) in 120 h, or 100% and 49%, respectively, of the initial PCP after 144 h of liquid culture).",M2

The effects of DO concentration on pentachlorophenol (PCP) reduction and its microbial community were investigated in a coupled anaerobic and aerobic reactor. Both the diversity and the dynamicity of the Eubacteria and Archaea community, which were responsible for PCP degradation, were evaluated by means of amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separation using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. The results demonstrated a major shift in the Eubacteria and Archaea community as the mixed aerobic and anaerobic seeding sludge (1:1 by volume) developed into coupled granules and finally acclimated with PCP throughout the experiment period within 60 days. The numbers of the Eubacteria population decreased from 20, 16 to 11; Shannon diversity index decreased from 2.75, 2.53 to 2.10. In contrast, the number of the Archaea population increased from 12, 14 to 18; and Shannon diversity index increased from 1.87, 1.88 to 2.43.

19249810,"Fenton's oxidation of pentachlorophenol.The combination of H(2)O(2) and Fe(II) (Fenton's reaction) has been demonstrated to rapidly degrade many organics via hydroxyl radicals. However, few studies have related hydroxyl radical generation rates with measured organic chemical degradation data. The goals of this work were to investigate the kinetics, stoichiometry, and intermediates of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) degradation in the Fenton's reaction and to develop a mathematical model of this reaction system. Batch reaction experiments were performed to assess both initial transients and steady states, and special attention was given to the analysis of intermediates. Solutions of PCP (55 microM) and Fe(II) (200 microM) were treated with variable levels of H(2)O(2) (&lt;850 microM), and the concentrations of these reactants and their products were measured. Partial PCP degradation and near stoichiometric dechlorination were observed at low initial H(2)O(2) concentrations. Higher H(2)O(2) doses achieved at most 70% dechlorination even though nearly all of the PCP was degraded. The reaction intermediates tetrachlorohydroquinone and dichloromaleic acid accounted for up to 5% of the PCP degraded. Organic carbon mineralization (transformation to CO(2)) was not observed. The ()OH scavenging effects of the PCP-by-products mixture were characterized as a lumped parameter in the reaction kinetics model, which provided reasonable predictions of experimental results at different oxidant concentrations and reaction time.",M2
19243109,"AFM and FTIR spectroscopy investigation of the inverted hexagonal phase of cardiolipin.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and FTIR spectroscopy techniques have been exploited to investigate the inverted hexagonal phase (H(II)) of cardiolipin obtained by dehydration of a phospholipid water dispersion on a solid support. The characteristic cylinders of the H(II) phase have been imaged by AFM and the effects of different preparation conditions (temperature and the presence of chemicals) on the structural parameters and on the presence of local nanoscale defects have been studied. It has been found that the measured repeat spacing of the H(II) cylinders decreases upon increase of temperature and addition of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), a chemical which is known to affect the structure and function of lipid bilayers. It has been shown that AFM can help in revealing some features of the mechanism of the inverted hexagonal phase formation, corroborating the results of a recent molecular dynamics study on the H(II) phase formation from multilamellar phospholipid structures.",M2
19242755,"Cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of the maleylacetate reductase from Sphingobium chlorophenolicum strain ATCC 53874.The final enzyme in the pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) biodegradation pathway in Sphingobium chlorophenolicum is maleylacetate reductase (PcpE), which catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation of 2-chloromaleylacetate to maleylacetate and the subsequent reduction of malyelacetate to 3-oxoadipate. In this study, the pcpE gene was cloned from S. chlorophenolicum strain ATCC 53874 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI cells. The recombinant PcpE, purified to higher than 95% purity using affinity chromatography, exhibited optimal activity at pH 7.0. The kinetic parameters k(cat) and K(m) were 1.2 +/- 0.3 s(-1) and 0.09 +/- 0.04 mM, respectively, against maleylacetate under the optimal pH. In addition, the purified PcpE was able to restore PCP-degrading capability to S. chlorophenolicum strain ATCC 39723, implicating that there was no functional PcpE in the ATCC 39723 strain.",M2
19214760,"Enrichment, isolation and characterization of pentachlorophenol degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. ISTPCP-3 from effluent discharge site.Three pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) degrading bacterial strains were isolated from sediment core of pulp and paper mill effluent discharge site. The strains were continuously enriched in mineral salts medium supplemented with PCP as sole source of carbon and energy. One of the acclimated strains with relatively high PCP degradation capability was selected and characterized in this study. Based on morphology, biochemical tests, 16S rDNA sequence analysis and phylogenetic characteristics, the strains showed greatest similarity with Acinetobacter spp. The strain was identified as Acinetobacter sp. ISTPCP-3. The physiological characteristics and optimum growth conditions of the bacterial strain were investigated. The results of optimum growth temperature revealed that it was a mesophile. The optimum growth temperature for the strain was 30 degrees C. The preferential initial pH for the strain was ranging at 6.5-7.5, the optimum pH was 7. The bacterium was able to tolerate and degrade PCP up to a concentration of 200 mg/l. Increase in PCP concentration had a negative effect on biodegradation rate and PCP concentration above 250 mg/l was inhibitory to its growth. Acinetobacter sp. ISTPCP-3 was able to utilize PCP through an oxidative route with ortho ring-cleavage with the formation of 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorohydroquinone and 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol, identified using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. The degradation pathway followed by isolated bacterium is different from previously characterized pathway.",M2
19188014,"Enhanced biodegradation of pentachlorophenol in unsaturated soil using reversed field electrokinetics.This study investigated the use of electrokinetics in unsaturated soil to promote biodegradation of pentachlorophenol through increased contact between bacteria and contaminant. Soil microcosms, contaminated with approximately 100 mg kg(-1) pentachlorophenol (containing [(14)C]-<e>PCP</e> as a tracer), and inoculated with a specific pentachlorophenol-degrading bacterium (Sphingobium sp. UG30-1 x 10(8) cfu g(-1)) were subjected to constant and regularly reversed electric currents (10 mA). The former caused large pH and moisture content changes due to water electrolysis and electroosmotic effects, with subsequent negative impacts on biodegradation parameters including enzyme activity and contaminant mineralisation (as measured by (14)CO(2) evolution rate). The reversed field caused little change in pH and moisture content and led to more rapid contaminant mineralisation, lower soil contaminant concentration in the majority of the microcosms and increased soil enzyme activity (with the exception of soil immediately adjacent to the anode). The presence of an electric field, if suitably applied, may therefore enhance contaminant biodegradation in unsaturated soil.",M2
19152355,"Morbidity in former sawmill workers exposed to pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>): a cross-sectional study in New Zealand.BACKGROUND: From 1950 to 1990 pentachlorophenol (PCP) was used widely in the New Zealand sawmill industry, and persistent claims of long-term health effects have been made. METHODS: We surveyed surviving members of a cohort enumerated to study mortality in sawmill workers employed from 1970 to 1990. Estimates of historical exposure were based on job titles held, using the results of a PCP biomonitoring survey conducted in the 1980s. The survey involved interviews and clinical examinations, with interviewers and examiners blinded to exposure status. RESULTS: Of the 293 participants 177 had not been exposed, and of the 116 exposed all but 10% had low or short-term PCP exposure. Nevertheless, a number of significant associations between PCP exposure and the prevalence of various symptoms were observed including associations between: (i) exposure levels and self-reported tuberculosis, pleurisy or pneumonia (P &lt; 0.01) and a deficit in cranial nerve function (P = 0.04); (ii) duration of employment and thyroid disorders (P = 0.04), and neuropsychological symptoms including often going back to check things (P = 0.04), low libido (P = 0.02) and heart palpitations (P = 0.02), and a strong dose-response trend for frequent mood changes without cause (P &lt; 0.01); and (iii) cumulative exposure and frequent mood changes without cause (P = 0.02), low libido (P = 0.04), and in the overall number of neuropsychological symptoms reported (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: PCP exposure was associated with a number of physical and neuropsychological health effects that persisted long after exposure had ceased.",M2
19150748,"Rapid photocatalytic degradation of <e>PCP</e>-Na over NaBiO3 driven by visible light irradiation.The photocatalytic performance of sodium pentachlorophenate (PCP-Na) over NaBiO(3) under visible light irradiation was first investigated systematically. After 1h of photocatalytic reaction, the degradation rate of PCP-Na could reach to 90.5% in appropriate conditions. OH is the dominant photooxidant rather than O(2)(-) based on the experiment results and density of states (DOS) analysis. The PCP-Na solution became basic (pH value increased to approximately 9) with the progress of photocatalytic reaction which may be attributed to the PCP(-) oxidized to the pentachlorophenoxy radical by an attack on PCP(-) by OH. The photocatalytic reaction over NaBiO(3) follows the rule of first-order reaction according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The initial concentration of the PCP-Na, the initial pH value of PCP-Na aqueous solution and the amount of NaBiO(3) used have great influences on the photocatalytic performance. Three kinds of photocatalytic systems (P25, Bi(2)O(3) and P25-Bi(2)O(3) heterojunction) exhibited relative lower photocatalytic activity compared to NaBiO(3) powder.",M2
19143350,"Molecular characterization of bacterial community in aerobic granular sludge stressed by pentachlorophenol.To characterize the effects of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) on the performance and microbial community of aerobic granular sludge in sequencing batch reactor (SBR), the web-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) techniques were used to explore the bacterial community structure. When PCP increased from 0 to 50 mg/L, the COD removal rate changed little, while the ammonia removal rate dropped from 100% to 64.9%. The results of molecular characterization showed that the quantity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) kept constantly, although the number of bacteria species decreased with the increase of PCP concentration. Significant shift in bacterial community structure at different PCP stresses was observed within aerobic granular sludge. When the PCP was absent, there are 69 strains in aerobic granular sludge detected by T-RFLP method. With the increase of PCP, most of bacteria disappeared and only 19 bacteria existed at all five PCP concentrations. These results contributed to comprehensive understanding of the microbial community structure under the PCP stress and its relationship with the performance for wastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge.",M2
19143337,"Radiolysis of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in aqueous solution by gamma radiation.Steady-state radiolysis experiments were performed to investigate the y-irradiation treatment of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in aqueous solution. The effect of initial concentration on the PCP degradation was also investigated. The experimental results showed that gamma-irradiation was able to degrade PCP in aqueous solution successfully, and the radiolytical degradation process of PCP could be described by the first-order kinetic model. When the initial concentration of PCP was 25 and 50 mg/L and the radiation dose was 4 and 6 kGy, respectively, the degradation efficiency was 100%. A luminescence bacterial test was used for evaluating the toxicity of the radiolytic intermediate products. Total detoxification of a 75 mg/L PCP solution could be achieved by carrying out the irradiation procedure at the dose of 15 kGy.",M2
19117591,"Pentachlorophenol decomposition by electron beam process enhanced in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA.This study focuses on the enhanced decomposition of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in an electron beam (E-beam) process. To attain this objective, we investigated a synergistic effect of ferric-ethylenediamineacetate (Fe(III)-EDTA) and H(2)O(2) as additives to produce additional hydroxyl radical (*OH) at low dose. In this process, aqueous electron and hydrogen atom rapidly react with O(2) molecules, thereby forming hydroperoxyl/superoxide anion radical (HO2*/O(2)(-)), which reduces the Fe(III)-EDTA into Fe(II)-EDTA. Further *OH is produced by a well-known Fenton-like reaction of Fe(II)-EDTA with H(2)O(2) formed newly in E-beam. The complete decomposition of the initial PCP at 0.1mM was enhanced even at very low dose (&lt;10 kGy) with 20 microM Fe(III)-EDTA and H(2)O(2) less than 1mM. This observation was supported by the increased amount of Cl(-) produced by the decomposition of PCP. Thus, in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA during E-beam irradiation, the HO2*/O(2)(-)-driven Fenton-like reaction produces much more ()OH, which is significant for the complete degradation of PCP.",M2
19082768,"Developmental exposure to pentachlorophenol affects the expression of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 and synapsin I in brain, resulting in thyroid function vulnerability in rats.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), a component of biocides and a contaminant in diverse tissue samples from humans from various geographic areas, disrupts regulatory effects of thyroid hormones. Here we examined the effects of developmental exposure of rats to PCP on various aspects of brain development, male reproductive function, and adrenal function, all of which are under thyroid hormones regulation. PCP was administered to dams and their offspring via drinking water (6.6 mg l(-1)) during gestation and lactation. Tissue samples were obtained from dams, 3-week-old weanling pups, and 12-week-old pups. Gene expressions of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 and synapsin I, factors that promote brain growth, was increased in the cerebral cortex of PCP-treated weanling females, whereas plasma concentrations of total thyroxine were decreased in dams and weanling pups, and plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were higher in PCP-treated weanling males. PCP caused a decrease in plasma corticosterone concentrations in 12-week-old female rats, but not in male rats or weanling females. PCP-treated male pups had significantly increased testis weight at 12 week of age. No overt signs of toxicity were noted throughout this study. Our results show that PCP exposure during development causes thyroid function vulnerability, testicular hypertrophy in adults, and aberrations of brain gene expression.",M2
19052685,"The dechlorination of pentachlorophenol by zerovalent iron in presence of carboxylic acids.The dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) by zerovalent iron (Fe(0)) in presence of low molecular weight carboxylic acids was investigated. The experimental results showed that oxalic acid was advantaged among the selected acids for the dechlorination of PCP. The lower pH value and the higher dosage of Fe(0) were favorable for the enhancement of dechlorination efficiency. With their strong complexing and pH buffering properties, carboxylic acids favored the fresh surface of iron, which benefits to the dechlorination of PCP by Fe(0). Moreover, the oxalate-iron complexes have more reductive activities and then lead to the highest dechlorination efficiency of PCP by Fe(0).",M2
19036402,"Serum dioxin levels in former New Zealand sawmill workers twenty years after exposure to pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) ceased.From the 1950s to the late 1980s pentachlorophenol (PCP) based anti-sapstain fungicides were widely used in the New Zealand timber industry. Workers involved in treatment, or those handling freshly treated timber, experienced significant PCP exposure. Commercial grade PCP contained contaminants including 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners. To determine whether PCP exposure had resulted in elevated serum dioxin levels twenty years after its use had ceased we tested 94 former sawmill workers randomly selected from surviving members of a cohort enumerated for a mortality and cancer incidence study. After interviewing these individuals to collect demographic data and a comprehensive work history, they were divided into 71 PCP-exposed and 23 non-exposed individuals on the basis of job title and work tasks performed. We compared age-adjusted dioxin levels in the exposed and non-exposed groups, examined the effect of PCP exposure duration and intensity, and compared congener profiles with those found in the commercial grade PCP used at the time. Mean levels in exposed workers were elevated when compared with the non-exposed, with levels of 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD and OCDD being two to three times higher. The congener profiles in serum were consistent with those in PCP solutions, and dioxin levels increased with both employment duration and estimated exposure intensity. Serum dioxin levels in former New Zealand sawmill workers remain elevated twenty years after exposure to PCP ceased, and reflect the pattern of past PCP exposure.",M2
19031881,"Heterogeneous photodegradation of pentachlorophenol with maghemite and oxalate under UV illumination.The degradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in a heterogeneous system with maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) and oxalate under UV illumination was investigated in this study. The results of adsorption experiments demonstrated competitive adsorption between PCP and oxalic acid on the surface of gamma-Fe2O3. The results of photodegradation experiments showed that the rate of PCP degradation strongly relied on the oxalic acid concentration and that an optimal tested initial concentration of oxalic acid (Cox(0)) of 0.8 mM was obtained under our experimental conditions. It was observed that a sufficient amount of oxalic acid can be adsorbed on the gamma-Fe2O3 to form various Fe(III)-oxalate complexes at Cox(o) = 0.8 mM. During the photoreaction, Fe(C2O4)2- and Fe(C2O4)3(3-) were found to be the dominant Fe(III)-oxalate complexes at different Cox(0), while Fe(C2O4)2(2-) was the dominant Fe(II)-oxalate complex at Cox(0) &gt; or = 0.8 mM. The mechanism of H2O2 formation and consumption in the UV-irradiated gamma-Fe2O3/oxalate system was proposed and evaluated. Furthermore, six intermediates of PCP degradation were identified by GC/MS, HPLC, and IC analyses, respectively, and a possible pathway of PCP degradation in such a system was proposed.",M2
19028411,"Immobilization of pentachlorophenol in soil using carbonaceous material amendments.In this study, three pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) laboratory-spiked and one field-contaminated soil were amended with 2.0% char, humic acid (HA) and peat, respectively. The amended soils were aged for either 7 or 250 days. After amendment, CaCl(2) extractability of PCP was significantly decreased. Desorption kinetics indicated that the proposed amendment could lead to a strong binding and slow desorption of PCP in soils. Amendment with char reduced the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of PCP most significantly for earthworms (Eisenia fetida) in all soils studied. The results of both physicochemical and biological tests suggested that amendment reduced PCP bioavailability quickly and enduringly, implying that carbonaceous material amendment, especially char amendment, was a potentially attractive in situ remediation method for sequestration of PCP in contaminated soil.",M2
19027988,"Chlorophenols induce lipid peroxidation and change antioxidant parameters in the leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).In this work, changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activity were determined in the leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>). We analyzed the content of free phenols, the level of lipid peroxidation, and also the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 by 2,4-DCP and PCP. Chlorophenols were spiked to soil in concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1). Plant seeds were raised in plastic pots containing soil at a temperature of 25 degrees C with a 16-h photoperiod and irradiance of 250 micromol m(-2) s(-1). The leaves were harvested on the third, sixth and twelfth days of the experiment. The inhibition of SOD activity in the leaves of wheat was observed for 2,4-DCP and PCP. 2,4-DCP and PCP induced changes in CAT activity with a stronger effect for PCP. The compounds markedly increased guaiacol POD activity during 12d of the exposition of wheat to their action. The increase in free phenol content was observed both for 2,4-DCP and PCP. Chlorophenols also induced a powerful lipid peroxidation process between the third and sixth days of the experiment. A higher concentration of chlorophenols used in our study induced greater changes in all of the investigated parameters. 2,4-DCP and PCP oxidized the fluorescent probe - dihydrorhodamine 123 - in the concentrations of 5 and 1 ppm, respectively, and the addition of magnesium ions enhanced the oxidative capacity of the examined xenobiotics.",M2
19027907,"Determination of halophenolic wood preservant traces in milk using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Extraction of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and pentachloroanisole (PCA) from whole fat cow milk using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with polyacrylate (PA) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibers was evaluated and compared. The PA was studied to extract PCA, TBP and PCP, while PDMS was used to extract PCA and acetyl derivatives of PCP and TBP. The parameters: fiber position, matrix effect, temperature and extraction time were studied. The analysis was made by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The results show that the distance between fiber and milk had a significant effect on the extraction kinetics. Also, the fat content in milk was a critical parameter that clearly affected the extracted mass of each compound. By using a PA fiber, the sensitivity for PCA and TBP was higher than that obtained with PDMS fiber; however, PA fiber did not allow PCP determination. The recoveries from milk were 95+/-4%, 96+/-2% and 96+/-4% for PCP, TBP and PCA, respectively, with the PDMS fiber and 94+/-3% and 95+/-1% for TBP and PCA, respectively, with PA fiber. The method using PDMS fiber was applied to real whole milk samples.",M2
19013710,"Enhanced removal of pentachlorophenol and 2,4-D from aqueous solution by an aminated biosorbent.The fungal biomasses of Penicillium chrysogenum were used as raw materials to prepare the aminated adsorbent through chemical grafting of polyethylenimine (PEI) on the biomass surface. Due to the protonation of amine groups, the PEI-modified biomass was found to possess the zero point of zeta potential at pH 10.2, higher than the pristine biomass at pH 3.8. The aminated biosorbent was effective in removing anionic pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) from aqueous solution. The sorption was pH-dependent and the sorption kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model. The sorption isotherms on the aminated biosorbent conformed to the Langmuir equation, with the maximum sorption capacity of 1.23 mmol/g for PCP and 1.22 mmol/g for 2,4-D. In the presence of Cu(2+) or Pb(2+), the sorption capacities for both PCP and 2,4-D were further enhanced, attributed to the formation of surface complex. FTIR and zeta potential analysis before and after the sorption revealed that the amine groups on the biomass surface played an important role in the sorption of PCP and 2,4-D, due to the electrostatic interaction between the positive protonated amine groups and the negative PCP/2,4-D.",M2
18992351,"Performance of a horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass (HAIB) reactor and dynamics of the microbial community during degradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>).The anaerobic biological treatment of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and methanol as the main carbon source was investigated in a horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass (HAIB) reactor at 30+/-1 degrees C, during a 220-day trial period. The reactor biomass was developed as an attached biofilm on polyurethane foam particles, with 24h of hydraulic retention time. The PCP concentrations, which ranged from 2.0 to 13.0 mg/L, were controlled by adding synthetic substrate. The HAIB reactor reduced 97% of COD and removed 99% of PCP. The microbial biofilm communities of the HAIB reactor amended with PCP, without previous acclimatization, were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) with specific Archaea oligonucleotide primers. The ARDRA technique provided an adequate analysis of the community, revealing the profile of the selected population along the reactor. The biomass activities in the HAIB reactor at the end of the experiments indicated the development of PCP degraders and the maintenance of the population of methanogenic Archaea, ensuring the high efficiency of the system treating PCP with added methanol as the cosubstrate. The use of the simplified ARDRA method enabled us to monitor the microbial population with the addition of high concentrations of toxic compounds and highlighting a selection of microorganisms in the biofilm.",M2
18987855,"Synergistic effect of laccase mediators on pentachlorophenol removal by Ganoderma lucidum laccase.Laccases have low redox potentials limiting their environmental and industrial applications. The use of laccase mediators has proven to be an effective approach for overcoming the low redox potentials. However, knowledge about the role played by the mediator cocktails in such a laccase-mediator system (LMS) is scarce. Here, we assembled different dual-agent mediator cocktails containing 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), vanillin, and/or acetovanillone, and compared their mediating capabilities with those of each individual mediator alone in oxidation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) by Ganoderma lucidum laccase. Cocktails containing ABTS and either vanillin or acetovanillone strongly promoted PCP removal compared to the use of each mediator alone. The removal enhancement was correlated with mediator molar ratios of the cocktails and incubation times. Analysis of the kinetic constants for each mediator compound showed that G. lucidum laccase was very prone to react with ABTS rather than vanillin and acetovanillone in the cocktails. Moreover, the presence of the ABTS radical (ABTS+*) and vanillin or acetovanillone significantly enhanced PCP removal concomitant with electron transfer from vanillin or acetovanillone to ABTS+*. These results strongly suggest that vanillin and acetovanillone mediate the reaction between ABTS and PCP via multiple sequential electron transfers among laccase and its mediators.",M2
18820023,"Maintenance role of a glutathionyl-hydroquinone lyase (PcpF) in pentachlorophenol degradation by Sphingobium chlorophenolicum ATCC 39723.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) is a toxic pollutant. Its biodegradation has been extensively studied in Sphingobium chlorophenolicum ATCC 39723. All enzymes required to convert PCP to a common metabolic intermediate before entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle have been characterized. One of the enzymes is tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TeCH) reductive dehalogenase (PcpC), which is a glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GST). PcpC catalyzes the GSH-dependent conversion of TeCH to trichloro-p-hydroquinone (TriCH) and then to dichloro-p-hydroquinone (DiCH) in the PCP degradation pathway. PcpC is susceptible to oxidative damage, and the damaged PcpC produces glutathionyl (GS) conjugates, GS-TriCH and GS-DiCH, which cannot be further metabolized by PcpC. The fate and effect of GS-hydroquinone conjugates were unknown. A putative GST gene (pcpF) is located next to pcpC on the bacterial chromosome. The pcpF gene was cloned, and the recombinant PcpF was purified. The purified PcpF was able to convert GS-TriCH and GS-DiCH conjugates to TriCH and DiCH, respectively. The GS-hydroquinone lyase reactions catalyzed by PcpF are rather unusual for a GST. The disruption of pcpF in S. chlorophenolicum made the mutant lose the GS-hydroquinone lyase activities in the cell extracts. The mutant became more sensitive to PCP toxicity and had a significantly decreased PCP degradation rate, likely due to the accumulation of the GS-hydroquinone conjugates inside the cell. Thus, PcpF played a maintenance role in PCP degradation and converted the GS-hydroquinone conjugates back to the intermediates of the PCP degradation pathway.",M2
18755236,"Mitochondrial uncouplers act synergistically with the fumigant phosphine to disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential and cause cell death.Phosphine is the most widely used fumigant for the protection of stored commodities against insect pests, especially food products such as grain. However, pest insects are developing resistance to phosphine and thereby threatening its future use. As phosphine inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and reduces the strength of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), we reasoned that mitochondrial uncouplers should act synergistically with phosphine. The mitochondrial uncouplers FCCP and <e>PCP</e> caused complete mortality in populations of both wild-type and phosphine-resistant lines of Caenorhabditis elegans simultaneously exposed to uncoupler and phosphine at concentrations that were individually nonlethal. Strong synergism was also observed with a third uncoupler DNP. We have also tested an alternative complex IV inhibitor, azide, with FCCP and found that this also caused a synergistic enhancement of toxicity in C. elegans. To investigate potential causes of the synergism, we measured DeltaPsi(m), ATP content, and oxidative damage (lipid hydroperoxides) in nematodes subjected to phosphine-FCCP treatment and found that neither an observed 50% depletion in ATP nor oxidative stress accounted for the synergistic effect. Instead, a synergistic reduction in DeltaPsi(m) was observed upon phosphine-FCCP co-treatment suggesting that this is directly responsible for the subsequent mortality. These results support the hypothesis that phosphine-induced mortality results from the in vivo disruption of normal mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, we have identified a novel pathway that can be targeted to overcome genetic resistance to phosphine.",M2
18722113,"Biosorption of pentachlorophenol from aqueous solutions by a fungal biomass.This study focuses on the use of non-viable Aspergillus niger biomass, for the biosorption of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) from aqueous solutions. Various forms of the biomass-autoclaved and chemically conditioned, were tested for their potential in the removal of PCP from aqueous solutions. It was found that PCP removal was pH dependent; PCP removal decreased with the increase in pH for all type of biomass, except for cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) biomass. For CTAB biomass, a near complete removal of PCP was observed at all pHs. Therefore, CTAB biomass was used in further studies. PCP removal was rapid, with an equilibrium time of 2h. The rate of adsorption kinetics was well described by a pseudo-second order model. Isotherm models of the type one and two parameter models were found to fit the isotherm data. PCP biosorption was found to be exothermic in nature; the amount of PCP sorbed decreased with an increase in temperature. Desorption was carried out using deionized water, dilute HCl and dilute NaOH, and it was found that most of the PCP was irreversibly bound to the biomass. The addition of inorganic salts did not affect the removal of PCP from aqueous solutions. Among the surface functional groups present on the biomass, carboxyl, amide and hydroxyl groups seem to have played a role in PCP biosorption. It was concluded that CTAB treated biomass was an excellent adsorbent for the removal of PCP from aqueous solutions.",M2
18712406,"Levels of metals and organic substances in workers at a hazardous waste incinerator: a follow-up study.PURPOSE: To determine the blood and urine concentrations of a number of metals and organic substances in workers at a hazardous waste incinerator (HWI) in Catalonia, Spain, 8 years after regular operations in the facility. To compare these concentrations with the baseline (1999) levels and with those obtained in previous (2000 and 2005) surveys. METHODS: The employees were divided into three groups according to their specific workplaces. Plasma analyses of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), as well as urinary analyses of 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP), pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HP) were carried out. Blood concentrations of manganese and mercury, and urinary levels of nickel were also determined. RESULTS: For organic compounds in plasma, the comparison of the current levels with those of previous surveys did not show any significant increase for any of the compounds analyzed. In contrast, plasma levels of PCBs 28, 52 and 101 were significantly lower than the respective baseline concentrations, while especially notable was the significant reduction in the levels of PCDD/Fs in plasma of plant workers, which decreased from 26.7 pg I-TEQ/g lipid in the baseline survey to the current 2.5 pg I-TEQ/g lipid. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, there are no evident signs of occupational exposure to a number of metals and organic substances in the workers of the HWI.",M2
18691730,"Pentachlorophenol dechlorination by an acidogenic sludge.This study reports the feasibility of removing pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) by an acidogenic process in batch reactors. When the acidogenic sludge was first acclimated with 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and developed 2,4,6-TCP dechlorinating activity, PCP could be ortho-dechlorinated to 3,4,5,-trichlorophenol (3,4,5-TCP) via 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol as the intermediary. However, due to PCP's higher hydrophobicity and its higher expected Gibbs free energy yield, it was adsorbed to the sludge and dechlorinated preferentially to 2,4,6-TCP. This resulted in the inhibition of 2,4,6-TCP dechlorination. PCP removal under acidogenic condition was attributed to both reductive dechlorination and adsorption. At low PCP loads of 0.48micromoles/gMLVSS.d, dechlorination was the dominant removal mechanism (69% of total removal), while at the higher PCP load of 9.3micromoles/gMLVSS.d, adsorption was the main mechanism (82% of total removal). Attempts to induce meta or para position dechlorination of PCP failed when using meta position chlorophenols such as 2,3,6-TCP, 3,4,5-TCP and 3,5-DCP as the initial substrates. Overall, acidogenic biotreatment was an effective process in reducing PCP loads prior to downstream biological treatment.",M2
18683261,"Anaerobic mineralization of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) by combining PCP-dechlorinating and phenol-degrading cultures.The dechlorination and mineralization of pentachlorophenol (PCP) was investigated by simultaneously or sequentially combining two different anaerobic microbial populations, a PCP-dechlorinating culture capable of the reductive dechlorination of PCP to phenol and phenol- degrading cultures able to mineralize phenol under sulfate- or iron-reducing conditions. In the simultaneously combined mixture, PCP (about 35 microM) was mostly dechlorinated to phenol after incubation for 17 days under sulfate-reducing conditions or for 22 days under iron-reducing conditions. Thereafter, the complete removal of phenol occurred within 40 days under both conditions. In the sequentially combined mixture, most of the phenol, the end product of PCP dechlorination, was degraded within 12 days of inoculation with the phenol degrader, without a lag phase, under both sulfate- and iron-reducing conditions. In a radioactivity experiment, [14C-U]-PCP was mineralized to 14CO2 and 14CH4 by the combined anaerobic microbial activities. Analysis of electron donor and acceptor utilization and of the production and consumption of H2, CO2, and CH4 suggested that the dechlorinating and degrading microorganisms compete with other microorganisms to perform PCP dechlorination and part of the phenol degradation in complex anoxic environments in the presence of electron donors and acceptors. The presence of a small amount of autoclaved soil slurry in the medium was possibly another advantageous factor in the successful dechlorination and mineralization of PCP by the combined mixtures. This anaerobic-anaerobic combination technology holds great promise as a cost-effective strategy for complete PCP bioremediation in situ.",M2
18678002,"Octachlorodibenzodioxin formation on Fe(III)-montmorillonite clay.Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) are ubiquitous and highly toxic environmental contaminants found in surface and subsurface soils and in clay deposits. Interestingly, the congener profiles of such PCDDs are inexplicably dissimilar to those of known anthropogenic (e.g., pesticide manufacture, waste incineration) or natural (e.g., forest fire) sources. Characteristic features of soil or clay-associated PCDDs are the dominance of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) as the most abundant congener and very low levels of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). These propensities led to the hypothesis of in situ PCDD formation in soils and geologic clay deposits. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of OCDD on the naturally occurring and widely distributed clay mineral montmorillonite under environmentally relevant conditions. When pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>)was mixed with Fe(III)-montmorillonite, significant amounts of OCDD were rapidly (minutes to days) formed (approximately 5 mg OCDD/kg clay) at ambient temperature in the presence of water. This reaction is initiated by single electron transfer from PCP to Fe(III)-montmorillonite thereby forming the PCP radical cation. Subsequent dimerization, dechlorination, and ring closure reactions result in formation of OCDD. This study provides the first direct evidence for clay-catalyzed formation of OCDD supporting the plausibility of its in situ formation in soils.",M2
18663967,"[Early effect of sodium pentachlorophenate on photosynthetic activity of the alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick S-39]Early effects of 0.0001-10 mM sodium pentachlorophenate (<e>PCP</e>-Na) on the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick. S-39 involves a rapid (within 1-2 min) decrease in the light-induced oxygen evolution by algal cells. The suppressed relative yield of variable chlorophyll fluorescence in C. pyrenoidosa in the presence of high PCP-Na concentrations and its dynamics provide evidence for rapid inactivation of photosystem 2, which is not observed at low concentrations of the toxicant. An analysis of the induction curve of delayed chlorophyll fluorescence in algal cells suggests that PCP-Na at low concentrations disturbs the coupling of electron transport and phosphorylation, whereas at high concentrations it inhibits electron transport and decreases the energy potential of photosynthetic membranes. The early toxic effect of PCP-Na is responsible for subsequent impairment of C. pyrenoidosa productivity.",M2
18656962,"Pentachlorophenol and other chlorinated phenols are substrates for human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase hSULT2A1.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) is a persistent chemical contaminant that has been extensively investigated in terms of its toxicology and metabolism. Similar to PCP, other chlorinated phenol derivatives are also widely present in the environment from various sources. Even though some of the chlorine-substituted phenols, and particularly PCP, are well-known inhibitors of phenol sulfotransferases (SULTs), these compounds have been shown to undergo sulfation in humans. To investigate the enzymatic basis for sulfation of PCP in humans, we have studied the potential for PCP as well as the mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-chlorinated phenols to serve as substrates for human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, hSULT2A1. Our results show that all of these compounds are substrates for this isoform of sulfotransferase, and the highest rates of sulfation are obtained with PCP, trichlorophenols, and tetrachlorophenols. Much lower rates of sulfation were obtained with isomers of monochlorophenol and dichlorophenol as substrates for hSULT2A1. Thus, the sulfation of polychlorinated phenols catalyzed by hSULT2A1 may be a significant component of their metabolism in humans.",M2
18649935,"Sonophotocatalysis of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.Sonolysis and photolysis often exhibit synergistic effects in the degradation of organic molecules. An assay of fish oocyte maturation provides an appropriate experimental system to investigate the hormonal activities of chemical agents. Oocyte maturation in fish is triggered by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH), which acts on receptors on the oocyte surface. A synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), possesses inducing activity of fish oocyte maturation, and a widely used biocide, pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), exhibits a potent inhibitory effect on fish oocyte maturation. In this study, the effects of the combined treatment by sonolysis with photolysis (sonophotocatalysis) to diminish the hormonal activity of DES and the maturation preventing activity of PCP was examined. By sonophotocatalysis, hormonal activity of DES was completely lost within 30 min and the inhibiting activity of PCP was lost within 120 min. These results demonstrated that sonophotocatalysis is effective for diminishing the endocrine-disrupting activity of chemical agents.",M2
18649921,"Sorption of pentachlorophenol on surficial sediments: the roles of metal oxides and organic materials with co-existed copper present.The sorption characteristics of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in the surficial sediments were investigated using a selective extraction procedure. The results show that the Gamma(max) of PCP sorption decreased from 1.60 micromol g(-1) to 0.69 micromol g(-1) by approximately 60% after selective removal of organic materials from the sediments. The sorption of PCP in the sediments after selective removal of Mn oxides increased nearly up to 600% (from 1.60 micromol g(-1) to 11.11 micromol g(-1)) and, to a less degree, the PCP sorption in the sediments after simultaneous removal of Fe/Mn oxides (Gamma(max)=3.53 micromol g(-1)). The analysis of the data using an additional model indicates that the contribution of Mn oxides to PCP sorption was negative, and Fe oxides and organic materials both have greater potential for sorption of PCP with less contribution from residues including Mn and Fe oxides in the residual fractions determined by a sequential extraction procedure and clay and silicate minerals. The differences in the decreased degrees of PCP sorption with increasing of Cu suggest that competition between Cu and PCP for sorption sites mainly takes place on Fe oxides.",M2
18649533,"[Preparation of a novel aminated fungal biomass and its sorption for typical endocrine disruptors]The fungal biomass of Penicillium chrysogenum was used as raw materials to prepare the sorbent, and polyethylenimine (PEI) was grafted onto the biomass surface in a two-step reaction. The best sorbent was obtained through the optimization experiments. As the PEI-modified biomass was found to possess zero zeta-potential at pH 10.2, the biosorbent is favorable for the removal of anionic pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) potassium in water. The sorption isotherms of the biomass for three pollutants were well described by Langmuir equation, with a maximum sorption at 342.9 mg PCP, 234.1 mg 2,4-D and 1725.6 mg PFOS per g biomass. The thermodynamic parameters calculated show that the sorption for three pollutants was spontaneous, and the sorption for 2,4-D and PFOS were endothermic, while the sorption for PCP was exothermic.",M2
18637348,"[Oxidation kinetics of pentachlorophenol by manganese dioxide]Experiments were conducted to determine oxidation kinetics of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) using manganese dioxide (MnO2) as an oxidant. The influence of cosolutes (e.g. inorganic ions and organic substances) on the reaction kinetics was also assessed. When simulating the kinetics of PCP with n-order reaction model by a non-linear curve fitting approach, the reaction order n is over 0.999, which suggests that the first order reaction model fit the degradation kinetics of PCP. The apparent rate constant k(obs) values are 2.86 h(-1) for the centrifugation method and 2.14 h(-1) for the ascorbic acid method by non-linear fitting the kinetics of PCP for 0.5 h reaction using pseudo-first-order model under the 95% confidence limits. The addition of bivalent metal ions causes the considerable reduction of the apparent rate constants. The significant effect on the k(obs) of PCP occurs when the concentration of Mn2+ above 2% of the initial MnO2 is added as the co-solute, but no significant influence on the k(obs) of PCP for the presence of other ions. The presence of caffeic acid, syringic acid or gallic acid reduces the reaction rate of PCP significantly. Oppositely, no considerable decrease of k(obs) is observed in experiments with the addition of cinnamonic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid or ortho (para)-hydroxybenzoic acid. These experimental results demonstrate that the decrease of PCP adsorbed to MnO2 considerably or the action of competing against PCP reacted with MnO2 is the dominant factor that slows down the transformed rate of PCP oxidation by MnO2.",M2
18623605,"Pentachlorophenol decreases ATP levels in human natural killer cells.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) is used as a wood preservative and is found in human blood and urine. PCP causes significant decreases in the tumor-killing (lytic) function of human natural killer (NK) cells, a critical immune defense. The current study examined the association between decreased lytic function and decreased ATP levels, as well as the ability of antioxidants (vitamin E and reduced glutathione) to prevent PCP-induced decreases in either ATP levels or lytic function. Exposure of NK cells to 10 microm PCP decreased ATP levels by 15% at 24 h, and exposure to 5 microm PCP decreased ATP levels by 32% at 48 h. No effects were seen with 0.5 microm at 48 h or with 5 microm at 24 h. However, 10 microm PCP decreased lytic function by 69% at 24 h and 5 microm decreased it by 90% at 48 h. Even 0.5 microm PCP decreased lytic function by 46% at 48 h. None of these effects were prevented by pretreatment with 1 mm vitamin E or reduced glutathione.",M2
18622710,"Reduction of pollutants in pulp paper mill effluent treated by <e>PCP</e>-degrading bacterial strains.Two PCP-degrading bacterial strains, Bacillus cereus (ITRC-S6) and Serratia marcescens (ITRC-S7) were used for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluent at conditions; 1.0% glucose and 0.5% peptone at 30 +/- 1 degrees C at 120 rpm for 168 h of incubation. These two bacterial strains effectively reduced colour (45-52%), lignin (30-42%), BOD (40-70%), COD (50-60%), total phenol (32-40%) and PCP (85-90%) within 168 h of incubation. However, the highest reduction in colour (62%), lignin (54%), BOD (70%), COD (90%), total phenol (90%) and PCP (100%) was recorded by mixed culture treatment. The bacterial mechanism for the degradation of pulp and paper mill effluent may be explained by an increase in the cells biomass using added co-substrates resulting liberation of significant amount of chloride due to bacterial dechlorination of chlorolignins and chlorophenols this showed reduction in colour, lignin and toxicity in the effluent. Further, GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate-extractable compounds from treated pulp paper mill effluent reinforces the bacterium capability for the degradation of lignin and pentachlorophenol, as many aromatic compounds such as 2-chlorophenol, 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol and tetrachlorohydroquinone, 6-chlorohydroxyquinol and tetrachlorohydroquinone detected which were not present in the untreated effluent.",M2
18555596,"Rapid photocatalytic destruction of pentachlorophenol in F-Si-comodified TiO(2) suspensions under microwave irradiation.A novel photocatalysis material, F-Si-comodified TiO(2) (FST) powder, was synthesized by ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis. The prepared material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, respectively. XRD analysis indicated that the phase of FST was pure anatase and Si atoms suppressed the growth of titania crystalline, XPS spectra showed that FST was composed of Ti, O, Si and F element, the band gap energy of FST calculated according to the spectrum of UV-vis absorption was 3.26 eV. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin-trap reagent has been applied to detect free radical intermediates generated from FST. ESR results showed the concentration of the active species (OH) on FST is higher than those on F-doping TiO(2) (FT), Si-modifying TiO(2) (ST) and P25 titania. The degradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) in the microwave-assisted photocatalysis (MAPC) process was faster than other processes including microwave-assisted direct photolysis (MADP), microwave process alone (MP) and dark process (DP). The photocatalytic activity of FST is much higher than that of ST, FT and P25 titania. It may be attributed to its strong capacity of absorption to the UV-vis irradiation and more hydroxyl radical on surface of FST. In MPAC process, 40 mg L(-1) PCP was completely degraded in 20 min and its corresponding mineralization efficiency was 71%, the pH of solutions decreased from 10.3 to 6.47 and the dechlorination was completed in 12 min. The intermediates products of PCP in MAPC process identified by GC/MS were trichlorophenols (TCP), tetrachlorophenols (TTCP) and tetrachlorocatechol (TTCC) and the possible mechanism of PCP degradation is proposed.",M2
18555512,"Two-phase partitioning bioreactor for the biodegradation of high concentrations of pentachlorophenol using Sphingobium chlorophenolicum DSM 8671.An organic-aqueous two-liquid-phase partitioning system was developed to degrade high concentrations of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>). Dioctyl sebacate was selected among 12 non-aqueous phases as the most suitable solvent to control the delivery of PCP to the aqueous phase for being non-biodegradable and biocompatible. In shake-flask experiments, the two-phase system was able to support the removal of 1g PCP l(-1) of total liquid phase. The performance of the two-liquid phase partitioning system (TLPPS) in shake-flask was evaluated under different conditions. At the initial biomass concentrations of 7, 25, and 58 mg dry weight l(-1), the volumetric removal rates of PCP obtained were 25.7+/-0.5, 32.1+/-0.1, and 39.3+/-2.9 mg PCP l(-1)h(-1), respectively. Higher performance was observed at lower organic-aqueous phase ratios (16% and 28%) than higher ones (37% and 44%). In a 2-l TLPPS, the degradation of 10 g PCP was completed in less than 100 h at a total volumetric rate of 142 mg l(-1) h(-1). Kinetics study using Monod model showed that compared to monophasic systems, the biphasic system significantly enhanced the maximum specific growth rate and PCP removal rate. Results of this biphasic system showed no accumulation of unknown by-product(s) which has been reported for physical-pretreatment or high-performance biphasic systems of PCP degradation.",M2
18501913,"Single-drop coacervative microextraction of organic compounds prior to liquid chromatography. Theoretical and practical considerations.Coacervates made of surfactant aggregates, namely aqueous and reverse micelles and vesicles, were firstly used as solvents in single-drop microextraction (SDME) and proposed for the extraction and concentration of chlorophenols prior to liquid chromatography. The formation of coacervate drops in the needle tip of conventional microsyringes depended on the type of intermolecular forces established between the surfactant headgroups making up the supramolecular aggregates; hydrogen bond interactions were strong enough to permit the formation of spherical drops. Stability of 1-50 microL coacervate drops was achieved by introducing the microsyringe needle tip in a PTFE rod, the end of which had been machined out with a heated flanging-tool to get circular flanges (diameters in the range 3.5-6 mm). The parameters affecting the efficiency of single-drop coacervative microextraction (SDCME) were investigated using vesicular coacervates as a solvent and 2-chlorophenol (CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) as model analytes. Coacervative microextraction dynamics fit to the general rate equation of liquid-liquid extraction. The effect of variables such as extraction time, drop volume, stirring rate, pH and temperature, on the extraction of chlorophenols was similar to that described for organic solvent drops. Electrolyte concentrations above 0.1 M caused drop instability. Under the optimum conditions, detection limits were in the range 0.1-0.3 microg L(-1). The relative standard deviation was between 4.3 and 5.6 at 20 microg L(-1) spiked level. The method was applied to the determination of the four chlorophenols in wastewater, superficial water from a reservoir and groundwater and the recoveries were in the range 79 and 106% at 5-20 microg L(-1) spiked level.",M2

The potency of bacterial isolates in degradation of PCP was monitored in terms of growth and utilization of PCP as substrate with spectrophotometer and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis. The strains were tested for their utilization of various organic compounds. The strain PCP3, showed higher potency to utilize PCP as sole source of carbon and energy than PCP1 and PCP2. The bacterial strain were able to utilize PCP through an oxidative and reductive route as indicated with the formation of tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TeCH), 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, respectively.",M2
18486366,"Modulation of signal transduction pathways in lymphocytes due to sub-lethal toxicity of chlorinated phenol.Chlorophenols and their derivatives are a major component of environmental pollutants that are potential immunotoxicants. Deaminase assay performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to chlorophenolic compounds and its derivatives demonstrated a decreased proliferation rate and cell death. Chlorophenolic exposure also led to impaired production of IL-21 and IL-9 along with many other cytokines and chemokines that potentiate the inflammatory response. Using the PBMC activation model and gene expression profiling we provide insights into mechanisms by which the chlorophenolic compounds and their derivatives, especially pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) dysregulate the inflammatory response. We have shown here that PCP represses IL21 and IL9 expression thus affecting various downstream signaling pathways. We propose that PCP, a potent pollutant, imparts its cytotoxicity by evading the immune response by simultaneously affecting multiple signaling pathways in lymphocytes.",M2
18480469,"Sperm mitochondrial integrity is not required for hyperactivated motility, zona binding, or acrosome reaction in the rhesus macaque.Whether the main energy source for sperm motility is from oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis has been long-debated in the field of reproductive biology. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we examined the role of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in sperm function by using alpha-chlorohydrin (ACH), a glycolysis inhibitor, and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler. Sperm treated with ACH showed no change in percentage of motile sperm, although sperm motion was impaired. The ACH-treated sperm did not display either hyperactivity- or hyperactivation-associated changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. When treated with PCP, sperm motion parameters were affected by the highest level of PCP (200 microM); however, PCP did not cause motility impairments even after chemical activation. Sperm treated with PCP were able to display hyperactivity and tyrosine phosphorylation after chemical activation. In contrast with motility measurements, treatment with either the glycolytic inhibitor or the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor did not affect sperm-zona binding and zona-induced acrosome reaction. The results suggest glycolysis is essential to support sperm motility, hyperactivity, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, while energy from oxidative phosphorylation is not necessary for hyperactivated sperm motility, tyrosine phosphorylation, sperm-zona binding, and acrosome reaction in the rhesus macaque.",M2

The concentrations of PCP and CNP decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s, whereas the concentrations of PCDD/Fs and their toxic equivalency (WHO2006-TEQ) remained. The major sources of PCDD/Fs in the paddy soil samples were attributed to impurities in PCP and CNP as a result of comparisons of homologue and congener profiles and principal component analysis. Based on the results of comparison of total input and remaining amount, it is estimated that more than 99% of PCP and CNP applied to the paddy fields had disappeared, whereas most of the applied PCDD/Fs and TEQ remained.",M2
18457858,"Declining polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans levels in the sediments from Dongting Lake in China.Dongting Lake is the second largest freshwater lake in China. Technical sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-<e>PCP</e>) had been sprayed since 1960s to control the spread of snailborne schistosomiasis up to the middle of 1990s. As one of the by-products of Na-PCP, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) may enter the environment. It has been reported that the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in sediments in Dongting Lake were 130-891 pg I-TEQ g(-1) in 1995. High toxicity of sediment to exposed microorganisms and fish may be risk on environment. In order to determine the present levels of the contamination, eight sediment samples from Dongting Lake were analyzed for PCDD/Fs using HRGC-HRMS. Total I-TEQ values for these samples were at a ranged of 0.7-11 pg g(-1), with a mean value of 4.5 pg g(-1). The results show that PCDD/Fs concentrations of contemporary sediment have declined since 1995. Certain PCDD/F congeners as well as OCDD, typical for Na-PCP, predominated in lake sediment indicating that the using of PCP-Na is the main source of PCDD/Fs in the lake. These variations in levels can reflect changes in PCDD/F sources to the environment over time.",M2

Simulations were performed for three soil types: sand, clay and organic. OCDD fate was modeled in the absence of co-contaminant and in the presence of oil with or without 5% (w/w) PCP. A variance propagation study was conducted to evaluate the model sensitivity to a small variation in input parameters, to determine the uncertainty on the migration depth modeled for each soil, and to understand the variability of this migration observed between different soil types. The model predicts a different OCDD fate depending on the soil type with a significant migration in the case of sand and an absence of migration in the case of organic soil. No migration is predicted in the absence of co-contaminants and a migration depth of 7-600 cm is predicted in the presence of oil (with and without PCP). Model sensitivity also depends on the soil type: the predicted OCDD migration depth is, respectively, 22 cm+/-10 cm for organic soils, 71 cm+/-20 cm for clay and 566 cm+/-200 cm for sand after 60 days of emissions from a class 3, 12.2m long pole. Even if the input parameters have a significant uncertainty due to the lack of available data, the model results seem reliable as a first approximation to screen an eventual PCDD/F migration.",M2

18329661,"Enhancement of the reductive transformation of pentachlorophenol by polycarboxylic acids at the iron oxide-water interface.The enhancement effect of polycarboxylic acids on reductive dechlorination transformation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) reacting with iron oxides was studied in anoxic suspension. Batch experiments were performed with three species of iron oxides (goethite, lepidocrocite and hematite) and four species of polycarboxylic acids (oxalate, citrate, succinate, and tartrate) through anoxic abiotic reactors. The chemical analyses and morphological observation from scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that different combinations between polycarboxylic acids and iron oxides produced distinct contents of Fe(II)-polycarboxylic ligand complexes, which significantly enhanced PCP transformation. Generation of the surface-bound Fe(II) depended on concentration of polycarboxylic acids. The optimal concentration for the enhancement was 2.0 mM oxalic acid. The dechlorination mechanism was further demonstrated by generation of chloride ions. The results suggest that surface-bound Fe(II) formed on the iron oxides surface appears to be a key factor in enhancing PCP transformation, and the mole ratio of oxalate to surface-bound Fe(II) (oxalate/Fe(II)) acted as an indicator of the enhancement effect. The enhancement mechanism attributes to strong nucleophilic ability and low reductive potential of the equivalent Fe(II)-polycarboxylate complexes. Therefore, the enhancement effects might be helpful for understanding the natural attenuation of reducible organic pollutants at the interface of contaminated soil in anoxic condition.",M2
18306892,"Formation of polychlorinated diphenyl ethers from condensation of chlorophenols with chlorobenzenes.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), which are among the members of persistent organic pollutants, and PCDEs have been determined in a number of environmental samples. The main possible sources are the technical production of chlorinated phenols and all processes of incomplete combustion. PCDEs were observed in the fly ash from a municipal waste incinerator (MWI). It was speculated that the condensation of chlorophenols with chlorobenzenes occurred via PCDEs to form polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Nevertheless, PCDEs formation from condensation of chlorophenols with chlorobenzenes has not been confirmed by experimental observation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the formation mechanism of PCDEs from the condensation of chlorophenols with chlorobenzenes. The results are expected to be helpful in understanding the formation of PCDEs and in controlling and abating PCDEs emissions from MWI. METHODS: The pyrolysis of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and/or polychlorobenzenes (PCBz) was carried out in a sealed glass tube. The reaction products were extracted and purified with K2CO3 solution. The samples were concentrated and then cleaned up on an alumina column. GC/MS was used for identification and quantification of reaction products. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that the pyrolysis of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) at 340 degrees C for 6 h led to the formation of decachlorodiphenyl ether (DCDE) (2.41 microg/mg) and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (OCDD) (0.24 micropg/mg), while the pyrolysis of PCP yielded DCDE (13.08 microg/mg) and OCDD (180.13 microg/mg). In addition, the amount of DCDE formation from the pyrolysis of the mixture of PCP and HCB was 4.65 times higher than the total amount of DCDE formation from the pyrolysis of HCB and PCP, respectively. This indicated that PCP and HCB were prone to condensation and formation of DCDE. DCDE was the main congener of PCDEs from condensation of PCP with HCB at 340, 400 and 450 degrees C. A small amount of nonachlorodiphenyl ether (NCDE) was formed by dechlorination reaction at 450 degrees C. The condensation of PCP with 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (Cl4Bz) formed 2,2',3,4,4',5,5',6-octachlorodiphenyl ether (OCDE). Small amounts of heptachlorodiphenyl ether (HpCDE) and hexachlorodiphenyl ether (HxCDE) were detected at 450 degrees C. Meanwhile, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and PCDFs were detected from the condensation of PCP and PCBz. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental studies clarified the behavior of the formation of PCDEs from condensation of polychlorophenols and PCBz. The condensation of polychlorophenols with PCBz formed PCDEs through elimination of HCl between polychlorophenols and PCBz molecules. Another pathway of PCDEs formation was elimination of H2O between two polychlorophenol molecules. In addition, dechlorination processes had caused the specific homologous pattern of PCDEs under higher temperatures.",M2
18290430,"[Removal of pentachlorophenol catalyzed by immobilized horseradish peroxidase]The removal of <e>PCP</e> using HRP immobilized by Fe3O4 sorption-gelatin embedding-cross linkage method as catalyzer was studied. Reaction conditions including the reacting time, different buffer systems and pH value, PCP initial concentration, HRP dosage were discussed in detail compared with free HRP. The results indicate that the equilibrium time of PCP removal reaction catalyzed by immobilized HRP is about 30 min, which is as fast as free HRP. The optimal pH for PCP removal by immobilized HRP is between 4-6, the proper pH should be more extensive than using free HRP. The highest catalyzing removal percent is 41% at pH 5. Low concentration of immobilized HRP can remove PCP effectively. PCP removal quantity increases but the removal percent decreases with the increase of initial concentration of PCP. The catalyzing removal percent goes down from 39.68% to 24.4%. Immobilized HRP can remove PCP repetitively. The catalyzing removal percent is still above 39% at 0.05 U/mL dosage of HRP when using 7 times repeatedly.",M2
18273741,"Evaluation of the apparent phytodegradation of pentachlorophenol by Chlorella pyrenoidosa.Several factors influencing the apparent phytodegradation of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions including photolysis, biodegradation, and direct phytodegradation by the algae, Chlorella pyrenoidosa. PCP was observed to degrade over time in all instances. Degradation occurred both with and without the presence of algae. The degradation of PCP was observed to be dependent primarily on photolysis with pseudo-first-order kinetics and rate constants in the range of 6.4 to 7.7 h(-1). In contrast, phytodegradation due to algal activity was negligible. It is suspected that the algae degradation may have been limited by the cycling of light exposure to simulate day and night periods.",M2
18262219,"Changes in microbiological metabolism under chemical stress.Chemical stress may alter microbiological metabolism and this, in turn, may affect the natural and engineered systems where these organisms function. The impact of chemical stress on microbiological metabolism was investigated using model chemicals 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Biological activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured in batch systems, with and without stressors at sub-lethal concentrations. Stressor DNP, between 49 and 140 mg l(-1), and PCP, at 15 and 38 mg l(-1), caused decreases in biomass growth yields, but did not inhibit substrate utilization rates. These effects increased with stressor concentrations, showing as much as a 10% yield reduction at the highest DNP concentration. This suggests that a portion of carbon and energy resources are diverted from growth and used in stress management and protection. Stressor DNP, between 300 and 700 mg l(-1), and PCP at 85 mg l(-1) caused decreases in growth yields and substrate utilization rates. This suggests an inhibition of both anabolism and catabolism. Stressor NEM was the most potent, inhibiting biological activity at concentrations as low as 2.7 mg l(-1). These findings will ultimately be useful in better monitoring and management of biological treatment operations and contaminated natural systems.",M2
18243807,"Interaction of diethylstilbestrol and ioxynil with transthyretin in chicken serum.The association of suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), diethylstilbestrol (DES), ioxynil and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), with chicken serum proteins was investigated in relation to thyroid system disruption. All of these chemicals strongly inhibited l-[(125)I]thyroxine ([(125)I]T(4)) binding to purified transthyretin (TTR) whereas PCP was less potent inhibitor than DES and ioxynil of [(125)I]T(4) binding to diluted whole chicken serum. This result suggested that PCP interacted with serum proteins other than TTR in whole chicken serum. Following the incubation of chicken serum with each chemical (final concentrations 0.25-1.0 microM), serum proteins were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (Cellulofine GCL-1000) and affinity chromatography (human retinol-binding protein coupled to Sepharose 4B). Although all chemicals were detected in the gel filtration chromatography 50-100 kDa fractions, DES and ioxynil, but not PCP, were co-eluted with TTR during affinity chromatography. Our results indicated that a significant proportion of DES and ioxynil, but a low proportion of PCP, interacted with TTR in whole chicken serum.",M2
18221836,"Effects of solvent, pH, salts and resin fatty acids on the dechlorination of pentachlorophenol using magnesium-silver and magnesium-palladium bimetallic systems.The effects of pH, organic co-solvent, salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and co-pollutants, resin and fatty acids (RFAs) on the dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) by magnesium/silver (Mg/Ag) and magnesium/palladium (Mg/Pd) systems were examined in the present investigations. Such studies provide relevant information about the applicability of bimetallic systems for remediation of raw wastewaters (such as pulp bleaching effluents) or groundwater. Removal efficiencies of 10 mg L(-1) PCP by Mg/Pd and Mg/Ag systems at the end of 1 h reaction were 93% and 78%, respectively, in the presence of acetone (1% v/v). On the other hand, the removal efficiencies were 86% and 70% for reactions conducted in alcoholic solvents (1% v/v) using Mg/Pd and Mg/Ag systems, respectively. The efficiencies of PCP removal by the two bimetallic systems could be correlated to the dipole moments of co-solvents used. The second order reaction rate constant for PCP removal by Mg/Ag system was highest (0.03 L mg(-1) min(-1)) in the absence of any pH-control mechanism. Optimum pH for the dechlorination of PCP by Mg/Pd system was found to be approximately 5.5 and &gt;92% of the compound was removed within 15 min of reaction. Presence of chlorinated and non-chlorinated resin fatty acids (RFAs) resulted in substantial reduction in the rate and extent of PCP removal by Mg/Ag system whereas dechlorination by Mg/Pd remained unaffected. Presence of sodium sulfate or sodium chloride in the reaction phase reduced the rate and extent of PCP removal by Mg/Ag system. PCP dechlorination by Mg/Pd system was adversely impacted by the addition of sodium chloride and unaffected by the presence of sodium sulfate.",M2
18190976,"Toxicity and bioaccumulation of xenobiotic organic compounds in the presence of aqueous suspensions of aggregates of nano-C(60).The potential of C(60)-nanoparticles (Buckminster fullerenes) as contaminant carriers in aqueous systems was studied in a series of toxicity tests with algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna). Four common environmental contaminants (atrazine, methyl parathion, pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), and phenanthrene) were used as model compounds, representing different physico-chemical properties and toxic modes of action. The aggregates of nano-C(60) formed over 2 months of stirring in water were mixed with model compounds 5 days prior to testing. Uptake and excretion of phenanthrene in 4-days-old D. magna was studied with and without addition of C(60) in aqueous suspensions. It was found that 85% of the added phenanthrene sorbed to C(60)-aggregates &gt;200 nm whereas about 10% sorption was found for atrazine, methyl parathion, and pentachlorophenol. In algal tests, the presence of C(60)-aggregates increased the toxicity of phenanthrene with 60% and decreased toxicity of PCP about 1.9 times. Addition of C(60)-aggregates reduced the toxicity of PCP with 25% in tests with D. magna, whereas a more than 10 times increase in toxicity was observed for phenanthrene when results were expressed as water phase concentrations. Thus, results from both toxicity tests show that phenanthrene sorbed to C(60)-aggregates is available for the organisms. For atrazine and methyl parathion no statistically significant differences in toxicities could be observed in algal and daphnid tests as a result of the presence of C(60)-aggregates. In bioaccumulation studies with phenanthrene in D. magna it was found that the uptake of phenanthrene was faster when C(60) was present in suspension and that a 1.7 times higher steady-state concentration was reached in the animals. However, a very fast clearance took place when animals were transferred to clean water resulting in no accumulation of phenanthrene. This study is the first to demonstrate the influence of C(60)-aggregates on aquatic toxicity and bioaccumulation of other environmentally relevant contaminants. The data provided underline that not only the inherent toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles, but also interactions with other compounds and characterisation of nanoparticles in aqueous suspension are of importance for risk assessment of nanomaterials.",M2
18187143,"Complete dechlorination of pentachlorophenol using palladized bacterial cellulose in a rotating catalyst contact reactor.A rotating catalyst contact reactor (RCCR) was developed which consisted of palladized bacterial cellulose immobilized on acrylic discs for hydrodechlorination of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>). More than 99% of 40 mg L(-1) PCP was dechlorinated to phenol in the presence of hydrogen in batch mode at initial pH values of 5.5 and 6.5 within 2 h of reaction with stoichiometric release of free chloride. The rate of PCP dechlorination was found to be independent of rotational speed of discs. PCP (40 mg L(-1)) hydrodechlorination experiments were also conducted using RCCR in continuous flow mode at hydraulic retention times of 1 and 2 h. The average outlet PCP concentrations revealed that liquid phase in RCCR closely resembled that of a continuous flow complete mix reactor (CFMR). Approximately 12 and 11 L of 40 mg L(-1) PCP (pH 6.5) could be treated in RCCR with 99 and 80% efficiencies in batch and continuous flow modes, respectively without any appreciable loss of the catalytic activity. These results suggested reusability of palladized bacterial cellulose which in turn is expected to substantially reduce the cost of treatment process. Thus RCCR seems to have high potential for treatment of ground water contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds. Dried palladized bacterial cellulose has been used as a material for electrodes in a fuel cell. However, its application as a hydrodechlorination catalyst in a reactor operating under room temperature and atmospheric pressure has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses suggested the irreversible deposition of palladium (Pd 0) particles on the bacterial cellulose fibrils.",M2

Use of sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-<e>PCP</e>) was the main contamination source of PCDD/Fs for soil/sediment and vegetation in the Dongting Lake region. Reed (Phragmitas communis Trin), Polygonum orientale L., and Artemisia selengensis Turcz ex Bess were selected as model plants to explore the pathway of PCDD/Fs transfer from contaminated soil to vegetation. In the vegetation tissue samples, the total international toxic equivalency values ranged from 0.14 to 1.64 pg international toxic equivalency/g dry weight with a mean value of 0.67 pg international toxic equivalency/g dry weight. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans congener distribution and bioaccumulation varied among vegetation species. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofuran levels in the leaves were found to be higher than those in the root and stem, which were affected considerably by volatilization from contaminated soil. Volatilization from polluted soil and subsequent sorption to leaves may be a significant pathway for contamination of vegetation in Dongting Lake region.",M2
18074281,"Pentachlorophenol oxidation rates in supercritical water.The oxidation rate of pentachlorophenol, [C(6)HCl(5)O] which is used to control termites and as a general herbicide and also as the probable human's carcinogen, was investigated in an isothermal continuous tubular reactor under supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) conditions. The experiments were conducted at a temperature of 400-550 degrees C and a fixed pressure of 25 MPa, with a residence time that ranged from 6 s to 26 s. The conversion of <e>PCP</e> was monitored by analyzing total organic carbon (TOC) on the liquid effluent samples. The initial TOC concentrations of PCP were varied from 0.74 mmol/L to 2.91 mmol/L and the oxygen concentrations were varied from 0.46 mmol/L to 3.52 mmol/L. By taking into account the dependence of the oxidant and TOC concentration on the reaction rate, a global PCP oxidation rate was regressed from the data of 48 experiments, to a 95% confidence level. The resulting activation energy was determined to be 43.56 +/- 1.47 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential factor was (1.92 +/- 0.46) x 10(2) L(1.16) mmol(-0.16) s(-1). The reaction orders for the PCP (based on TOC) and the oxidant were 0.74 +/- 0.02 and 0.42 +/- 0.05, respectively.",M2

In this study, serum testosterone concentration, activity of liver microsome ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) exposed to PCP for 7 and 15 d, respectively, were examined. The results showed that testosterone concentration was induced remarkably after 7 d (P&lt;0.05), and the testosterone concentrations in 15 d treatment crucian carp were higher than those in 7 d treatment. It was found that there were significant effects on activities of EROD and GST after crucian carp were exposed to PCP for 7 and 15 d (P&lt;0.05), compared to the controls. EROD and GST activities increased with increase in PCP concentration and also with increase in time on exposure. The results indicated that serum testosterone, EROD and GST were sensitive endpoints to PCP. PCP may have endocrine disrupting activities and may affect the reproductive success of this species. It is possible that the changes of hepatic microsome enzyme activities may result in alterations of serum testosterone levels in crucian carp.",M2
18054905,"Factors related to dioxin and furan body levels among Michigan workers.We evaluated serum concentrations of five selected dioxin, furan, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners among 412 workers at a Midland, Michigan plant that manufactured trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) and formulated chlorophenol-based products. We examined occupational indicators of exposure to these chlorophenols taking into account intrinsic factors such as age and body fat and potential environmental sources of exposure from consumption of local game and fish and other occupations. All five congeners were significantly associated with age and body fat. 2378-TCDD serum concentrations were associated with trichlorophenol operations, total years employed at the plant, as well as working as a hazardous waste worker. 123678-H(6)CDD serum concentrations were related to occupational PCP exposure, chloracne, recent weight loss, eating local game, and working as a hazardous waste worker. Serum concentrations of PCB126 were related to smoking (inversely), and eating local fish or local game. Other factors such as diet and jobs outside of the chlorophenol plant exposures had only a very minor impact on dioxin and furan concentrations in these workers.",M2
18039569,"Investigation of the biotransformation of pentachlorophenol and pulp paper mill effluent decolorisation by the bacterial strains in a mixed culture.Mixed culture of two bacterial strains Bacillus sp. and Serratia marcescens showed potential pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) degradation and decolorisation of pulp paper mill effluent. The physico-chemical quality of pulp paper mill effluent has been analyzed after 168 h incubation period degraded by mixed culture. The study revealed that it has decreased high load of BOD, COD, TS, TDS, TSS, sulphate, phosphate, total nitrogen, total phenols, metals and different salts (i.e. chloride, sodium, nitrate, potassium) at 168 h incubation period. PCP degradation in pulp paper mill effluent was confirmed by HPLC analysis. Mixed culture was found to degrade PCP up to (94%) present in pulp paper mill effluent with 1% glucose and 0.5% peptone (w/v) at 30+/-1 degrees C, pH 8.0+/-0.2 at 120 rpm in 168 h incubation period. The simultaneous release of chloride ion up to 1,200 mg/l at 168 h emphasized the bacterial dechlorination in the medium. The pulp paper mill effluent degradation was also supported by decline in pH, AOX (absorbable organic halides), color, D.O., BOD, COD and PCP. The analysis of pulp paper mill effluent degradation products by GC-MS analysis revealed the formation of low molecular weight compound like 2-chlorophenol (RT=3.8 min) and tetrachlorohydroquinone (RT=11.86 min) from PCP extracted degraded sample. Further, mixed culture may be used for bioremediation of PCP containing pulp paper mill waste in the environment.",M2
17969637,"Hydrothermal decomposition of pentachlorophenol in subcritical and supercritical water with sodium hydroxide addition.Hydrothermal decomposition of pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>, C6HCl5O), as the probable human carcinogen, was investigated in a tubular reactor under subcritical and supercritical water with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) addition. The experiments were conducted at a temperature range of 300-420 degrees C and a fixed pressure of 25 MPa, with a residence time that ranged from 10 s to 70 s. Under the reaction conditions, the initial PCP concentrations were varied from 0.25 to 1.39 mmol/L and the NaOH concentrations were varied from 2.5 to 25 times of the concentrations of PCP. The result of this study showed that PCP conversion in supercritical water was highly dependent on the reaction temperature, residence time, and NaOH concentration. PCP conversion in subcritical water is, however, only dependent on reaction temperature. NaOH concentration and residence times were found to have little effect on PCP conversion in subcritical condition. It was found that NaOH concentration affected the dechlorinations of PCP in the supercritical water. The intermediates detected were proposed to be tetrachlorophenol and trichlorophenol, respectively.",M2
17966505,"Enzymatic oxidation of aqueous pentachlorophenol.The influence of the nonionic surfactant Tween 80 on pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) oxidation catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase was studied. The surfactant was tested at concentrations below and above its critical micelle concentration (CMC). Enhancement of PCP removal was observed at sub-CMCs. The presence of Tween 80 in the reaction mixture reduced enzyme inactivation which occurred through a combination of free radical attack and sorption by precipitated products. A simple first-order model was able to simulate time profiles for enzyme inactivation in the presence or absence of Tween 80. At supra-CMCs, the surfactant caused noticeable reductions in PCP removal, presumably through micelle partitioning of PCP which precluded the hydrophobic PCP molecule from interacting with the enzyme.",M2
17965377,"Fungal inoculum properties: extracellular enzyme expression and pentachlorophenol removal by New Zealand trametes species in contaminated field soils.This study was conducted to improve the ability of indigenous New Zealand white-rot fungi to remove pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) from contaminated field soil. The effects of different bioaugmentation conditions on PCP removal and extracellular enzyme expression were measured in the laboratory. The conditions were fungal growth substrate and co-substrate composition, culture age, and Tween 80 addition to the contaminated soil. The fungi used were Trametes versicolor isolate HR131 and Trametes sp. isolate HR577. Maximum PCP removal was 70% after 7 wk from a 1043 mg kg(-1) PCP-contaminated soil inoculated with an 11-d-old fungal culture of T. versicolor isolate HR131. There was minimal production of undesirable pentachloroanisole by the fungi. Tween 80 addition had no affect on PCP removal. Poplar sawdust was more suitable as a fungal growth substrate and a co-substrate amendment for PCP removal and extracellular enzyme expression than the locally available pine and fir sawdust. Pentachlorophenol removal was not necessarily correlated with extracellular enzyme expression. The research results demonstrate that PCP biodegradation was affected by inoculum culture age, by the presence of a co-substrate amendment, and by growth substrate composition after white-rot fungal bioaugmentation into PCP-contaminated field soils.",M2

The uptake of the pesticides lindane, pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>), and propoxur, which are frequently used on farms, and in industries as well as by loggers and timber men on wood were studied in concrete ponds at the University of Cape Coast, in Ghana. The fish used for the study were Oreochromis niloticus, Clarias gariepinus, and Chrysicthys nigrodigitatus. They were obtained from cultured ponds in the Cape Coast and Mankessim districts in the Central Region and Weija Dam, in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Single high lethal concentration (SD) or acute treatment and cumulative/chronic (or multiple minor) lethal concentration (CD) treatment were employed in administering the pesticides to the fish via water. Gas chromatograph electron capture detector analysis was done on the dead fish to see the extent of ingestion. The LC(50 )values obtained for lindane on the three fish samples were as follows: Chrysicthys - 0.38 mg L(-1); Oreochromis - 0.42 mg L(-1), and Clarias - 1.2 mg L(-1). Mortalities occurred in fish within 3-5 days of application. For the PCP on Chrysicthys, Oreochromis, and Clarias species the LC(50) values were 0.42, 0.32 and 0.64 mg L(-1), respectively, for over a 2- to 3-day period. For a three-time influx period of propoxur the LC(50) for Chrysicthys, Oreochromis, and Clarias, were 22.0, 30.40, and 45.04 (all in mg L(-1)), respectively.

These were the dry weight percentage of fungal inoculum addition (31-175 g kg(-1)), PCP concentration (100-2137 mg kg(-1) PCP), fungal inoculum formulation, and time (1-7 wk). Five fungal isolates were used: the New Zealand isolates Trametes versicolor (L.: Fr.) HR131 and Trametes sp. HR577; the North American isolates Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. (two isolates) and Phanerochaete sordida (Karst.) Erikss. &amp; Ryv. Pentachlorophenol removal, manganese peroxidase, and laccase activity, and the formation of chloroanisoles in the contaminated field soils were measured. The majority of PCP removed by the Trametes isolates was in the first week after bioaugmentation. The maximum PCP removal by the fungi varied from 50 to 65% from a 1065 mg kg(-1) PCP contaminated field soil. Pentachlorophenol was preferentially converted to pentachloroanisole (PCA) by the Phanerochaete isolates (&gt;60%), while 2 to 9% of the PCP removed by two Trametes isolates was converted to PCA. A pH increase was measured following bioaugmentation that was dependent on PCP concentration, fungal inoculum addition, and formulation. This, together with rapid initial PCP removal, possibly changed the bioavailability of the remaining PCP to the fungi and significantly decreased the sequestering of PCP in the contaminated field soils. The research supports the conclusion that New Zealand Trametes spp. can rapidly remove PCP in contaminated field soils. Bioavailability and extractability of PCP in the contaminated field soil may significantly increase after bioaugmentation.",M2

In contrast, examination of a rural population of children where the same compounds were present at relatively low levels points to other inputs besides transformation of PeCB and HCB being responsible for the measured PCP concentrations.

17909638,"The environmental behaviour of polychlorinated phenols and its relevance to cork forest ecosystems: a review.Pentachlorophenol (<e>PCP</e>) has been used as a herbicide, biocide and preservative worldwide since the 1930s and as a result, extensive and prolonged contamination exists. The environmental impact increases when its many degradation products are taken into consideration. A number of chloroanisols and their related chlorophenols have been found in cork slabs collected from Portuguese oak tree forests before stopper manufacturing, and contamination by PCP and polychlorinated anisole (PCA) has been detected in Canadian forests. It is suggested that the use of polychlorinated phenols, in particular PCP, is thought to be a cause of the cork taint problem in wine, a major socio-economic impact not only for industry but on sensitive and highly biodiverse ecosystems. It also highlights particular issues relating to the regional regulation of potentially toxic chemicals and global economics world wide. To fully understand the impact of contamination sources, the mechanisms responsible for the fate and transport of PCP and its degradation products and assessment of their environmental behaviour is required. This review looks at the current state of knowledge of soil sorption, fate and bioavailability and identifies the challenges of degradation product identification and the contradictory evidence from field and laboratory observations. The need for a systematic evaluation of PCP contamination in relation to cork forest ecosystems and transfer of PCP between trophic levels is emphasised by discrepancies in bioaccumulation and toxicity. This is essential to enable long term management of not only transboundary contaminants, but also the sustainable management of socially and economically important forest ecosystems.",M2

Acute toxicity of the reaction solution reduced by 83% after 120 min of irradiation. Bioassay-derived 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQ(bio)) increased from 0.72 to 6.72 ng l(-1) during the former reaction stage, decreasing rapidly to 1.25 ng l(-1) during the latter reaction stage. HRGC/HRMS analysis detected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) congeners in the reaction mixtures. TEQ(bio) and chemical-derived 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQ(cal)) were about of the same order of magnitude. Both results illustrated the formation of dioxins and their removal by photoelectrocatalysis. Moreover, photoelectrocatalysis showed a significant priority over direct photolysis and photocatalysis depending on the reaction conditions, not only for PCP removal but also for reduction in toxicity.",M2

The results indicated a marked anti-nociception 2-25 min after ketamine injection, but this analgesic effect lasted for 40 min following PCP-CH3-tetralyl application in the tail immersion test. However, the data obtained from the formalin test showed that chronic pain could be significantly attenuated by ketamine, PCP and PCP-CH3-tetralyl.",M3
20145910,"Analysis of licking microstructure provides no evidence for a reduction in reward value following acute or sub-chronic phencyclidine administration.RATIONALE: The N-methyl D-aspartate antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) is purported to mimic the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, acute and sub-chronic PCP treatment in rodents might produce anhedonia, a decrease in the pleasure produced by rewards. OBJECTIVES: Experiment 1 investigated whether acute PCP treatment changes the value of sucrose. A comparison was made to (+)MK-801, a drug often used interchangeably with PCP in preclinical studies. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP treatment on the value of sucrose. METHODS: Experiment 1 examined the dose-response effects of PCP and (+)MK-801 on licking microstructure during sucrose consumption. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP treatment (5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days), on licking microstructure during sucrose consumption. Locomotor activity testing was carried out in experiment 2 to confirm the sensitisation effect of the PCP regimen on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. RESULTS: Low to moderate acute doses of PCP and (+)MK-801 increased the amount of sucrose consumed. Higher doses decreased consumption and the number of licks per cluster (cluster size) but also increased the average inter-lick interval, which may indicate motor impairment. There was no evidence that withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP treatment produced decreases in consumption or lick cluster size. CONCLUSIONS: Following acute PCP treatment, we found no evidence of reduced reward value without the presence of confounding motor deficits. Sub-chronic PCP withdrawal also produced no decrease in reward value. Therefore, the current results indicate that neither acute PCP treatment nor sub-chronic PCP withdrawal produce consummatory anhedonia.",M3
20111859,"Antagonism at serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors modulates functional activity of frontohippocampal circuit.RATIONALE: Several second-generation antipsychotics are characterised by a significant antagonistic effect at serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors (5-HT(2A)R), a feature that has been associated with lower incidence of extra-pyramidal symptoms and a putative amelioration of positive and negative symptoms experienced by schizophrenic patients. However, the neurofunctional substrate of 5-HT(2A) antagonism and its exact contribution to the complex pharmacological profile of these drugs remain to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to map the modulatory effects of the selective 5-HT(2A)R antagonist Ml00907 on the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity elicited by acute phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) challenge in the rat. PCP is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that induces dysregulation of corticolimbic glutamatergic neurotransmission and produces cognitive impairment and psychotic-like symptoms reminiscent of those observed in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Pre-administration of M100907 produced focal and region-dependent attenuation of PCP-induced response in frontoseptohippocampal areas. As early studies highlighted a permissive role of 5-HT(2A)R on frontal dopamine release, the role of post-synaptic dopamine D(1) receptors on PCP-induced response was examined by using the potent antagonist SCH23390. Interestingly, SCH23390 did not affect PCP's response in any of the regions examined. This finding rules out a significant contribution of dopamine in the functional changes mapped and, indirectly, the inhibitory effect of M100907, in favour of a glutamatergic origin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand recent evidence suggesting a key role of 5-HT(2A)R in modulating glutamate-mediated cognitive performance in the prefrontal cortex and highlight the whole frontoseptohippocampal circuit as a key functional substrate of 5-HT(2A)R antagonism in normal and disease states.",M3
20097262,"Effect of subchronic phencyclidine administration on sucrose preference and hippocampal parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the rat.Persistent blockade of NMDA receptor function by repeated phencyclidine dosing produces pathophysiological changes that model deficits observed in schizophrenia. The present study investigates the effects of subchronic phencyclidine administration (<e>PCP</e>; 2 or 5mg/kg bi-daily for 7 days followed by a drug-free period) on sucrose choice, a measure of anhedonia. Sucrose preference in a two-bottle sucrose-water choice test was assessed 1 and 2 weeks after PCP. Results showed no differences in sucrose intake between PCP rats and controls, nor a difference in water intake or total volume of liquid consumed at either time-point. Six weeks post-PCP, analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus with significant reductions localised to the CA1 and CA2/3 regions. These results demonstrate that while subchronic PCP may not be a valid model for the negative symptom of anhedonia observed in schizophrenia, it induces pathology in the brain in hippocampal subregions that are reminiscent of changes observed in schizophrenia.",M3
20080124,"Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) produces sexually dimorphic effects on voluntary sucrose consumption and elevated plus maze behavior.Previous research in our laboratory indicates that the psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine (PCP) reduces voluntary sucrose consumption in male rats, potentially modeling the schizophrenic symptom of anhedonia. Given reports from the clinical literature that schizophrenia has a later age of onset and more favorable outcome in females, PCP might be expected to have sexually dimorphic effects in animal models of schizophrenia such as PCP-induced decreases in voluntary sucrose consumption. Young adult (66 days old) and adult (109 days old) male and female rats were trained to drink sucrose during a 30 min/day presentation protocol. On the day prior to the test day, animals were treated with PCP (15 mg/kg) or saline four hours after the onset of the sucrose presentation (20 h prior to the sucrose on the test day). PCP decreased sucrose consumption on the test day similarly in adult males and females, although females also showed decreased water consumption. In young animals, PCP decreased sucrose consumption in males but not in females. These results are consistent with the prediction that females will be less sensitive to the schizophrenia-like behavioral effects of PCP. In a separate study, the same animals were tested in an elevated plus maze one to two months after testing for voluntary sucrose consumption. Significant sex x drug interaction effects on a number of measures in the elevated plus maze indicated that prior exposure to PCP had an anxiolytic effect in females and an anxiogenic effect in males. While unexpected, this finding indicates an additional sexually dimorphic effect of PCP on behavior and its potential relevance to the PCP model of schizophrenia is discussed.",M3
20077098,"Quantitation of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) in urine and blood using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).Phencyclidine (PCP) is a cycloalkylamine and is classified as a dissociative anesthetic. In the 1950s, PCP was tested as an intravenous anesthetic but due to its severe side effects, it was withdrawn from the clinical use. Since then PCP has become an illegal street drug making its laboratory analysis forensically essential. PCP can be detected in urine, serum, or plasma by immunoassays and quantified by gas or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In the method described here, a deuterated internal standard is added to the sample and the drug is extracted under alkaline conditions. Analysis is conducted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Quantitation of PCP is done by comparing the responses of unknown samples to the standards using selected ion monitoring.",M3
20074216,"Schizophrenia-related endophenotypes in heterozygous neuregulin-1 'knockout' mice.Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) has been shown to play a role in glutamatergic neurotransmission and is a risk gene for schizophrenia, in which there is evidence for hypoglutamatergic function. Sensitivity to the behavioural effects of the psychotomimetic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists MK-801 and phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) was examined in mutant mice with heterozygous deletion of NRG1. Social behaviour (sociability, social novelty preference and dyadic interaction), together with exploratory activity, was assessed following acute or subchronic administration of MK-801 (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) or PCP (5 mg/kg). In untreated NRG1 mutants, levels of glutamate, N-acetylaspartate and GABA were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and regional brain volumes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at 7T. NRG1 mutants, particularly males, displayed decreased responsivity to the locomotor-activating effects of acute PCP. Subchronic MK-801 and PCP disrupted sociability and social novelty preference in mutants and wildtypes and reversed the increase in both exploratory activity and social dominance-related behaviours observed in vehicle-treated mutants. No phenotypic differences were demonstrated in N-acetylaspartate, glutamate or GABA levels. The total ventricular and olfactory bulb volume was decreased in mutants. These data indicate a subtle role for NRG1 in modulating several schizophrenia-relevant processes including the effects of psychotomimetic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists.",M3
20045056,"Antipsychotic-like effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulator neboglamine: an immunohistochemical and behavioural study in the rat.Neboglamine is a functional modulator of the glycine site on the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Dysfunction of this receptor has been associated with negative and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that neboglamine behaves as a potential antipsychotic. We compared the effects of neboglamine, D-serine, clozapine, and haloperidol on the expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI), a marker of neuronal activation, in rat forebrain. We also studied the effects of these agents on phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced behaviour in rats, a model predictive of potential antipsychotic activity. Neboglamine, like haloperidol and clozapine, significantly increased the number of FLI-positive cells in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and lateral septal nucleus (3.2-, 4.8-, and 4.5-fold over control, respectively). Haloperidol dramatically increased FLI (390-fold over control) in the dorsolateral striatum, a brain region in which neboglamine and clozapine had no effect. The pattern of FLI induced by neboglamine closely matched that of d-serine, an endogenous agonist at the glycine site of NMDA receptors. Consistent with this finding, neboglamine restored NMDA-mediated neurotransmitter release in frontal cortex punches exposed to the NMDA antagonist PCP. In the behavioural model, all test compounds significantly inhibited PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. Unlike haloperidol and clozapine, neither neboglamine nor D-serine affected the basal levels of locomotor activity. Moreover, oral neboglamine dose-dependently inhibited both the hyperlocomotion and the frequency of rearing behaviour induced by PCP. These results, while confirming that the NMDA glycine site is a feasible target for activating the frontostriatal system, support the clinical evaluation of neboglamine as a treatment for schizophrenia.",M3
19997843,"Blockade of serotonin 2A receptors prevents <e>PCP</e>-induced attentional performance deficit and CREB phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum of DBA/2 mice.RATIONAL AND OBJECTIVE: Functional opposition between N-methyl-D-aspartate and 5-HT(2A) receptors may be a neural mechanism supporting cognitive functions. These systems converge on an intracellular signaling pathway that involves protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of different proteins including cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding (CREB). Thus, we tested whether selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, M100907, might abolish phencyclidine (PCP)-induced attentional performance deficit by preventing its effects on transduction mechanisms leading to CREB phosphorylation. METHODS: Using the five-choice serial reaction time task, the ability of subcutaneous injections of 2.5 and 10 microg/kg of M100907 to abolish the effects of an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg PCP on attentional performance as measured by accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and anticipatory and perseverative responding was assessed in DBA/2 mice. The effects of PCP, M100907, and their combination on S(133)-CREB and T(34)-DARPP32 phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of behaviorally naïve mice were examined using Western blotting technique. RESULTS: PCP reduced accuracy and increased anticipatory and perseverative responses as well as it increased S(133)-CREB phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum but not in the PFC. Ten microg/kg M100907 abolished the PCP-induced attentional performance deficits and the increase in S(133)-CREB but not T(34)-DARPP32 phosphorylation. By itself, M100907 had no effect on attentional performance or phospho-S(133)-CREB and phospho-T(34)-DARPP32. Interestingly, the effect of PCP on phospho-S(133)-CREB but not on phospho-T(34)-DARPP32 was dependent on endogenous 5-HT. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors may exert beneficial effects on cognitive deficits through a mechanism linked to striatal S(133)-CREB phosphorylation.",M3
19995568,"Effects of a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5 ADX47273 on conditioned avoidance response and <e>PCP</e>-induced hyperlocomotion in the rat as models for schizophrenia.Metabotropic glutamate receptors of the subtype 5 (mGluR(5)) are located in brain regions implicated in schizophrenia such as the cerebral cortex or the nucleus accumbens. They may therefore provide an interesting target for the treatment of psychoses. Currently available agonists of mGluR(5) are not selective, do not penetrate the brain and induce a tonic activation resulting in a rapid desensitization. Therefore, the research focus was shifted to positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Subsequently several mGluR(5) PAMs have been discovered, e.g. ADX47273 (S-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-{3-[3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-5-yl]-piperidin-1-yl}-methanone). In the present study, effects of ADX47273 (1-100mg/kg) were evaluated in rat models used for detecting antipsychotic-like activity: the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and the phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion models. Furthermore, the cataleptogenic potential of ADX47273 was compared to that of haloperidol. ADX47273 (100mg/kg) and various clinically used neuroleptics (haloperidol, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) attenuated CAR behaviour in rats. However, ADX47273 and aripiprazole failed to reduce the PCP-induced hyperlocomotion, whereas olanzapine and haloperidol diminished it. In contrast to haloperidol, ADX47273 (100mg/kg) failed to induce consistent catalepsy in rats. In conclusion, ADX47273 shows promising antipsychotic activity in some tests which require future investigation.",M3
19949321,"Subchronic phencyclidine in rats: alterations in locomotor activity, maze performance, and GABA(A) receptor binding.Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors, decreases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition, suggesting that changes in GABAergic receptor function underlie behavioral and cognitive deficits resulting from repeated administration of PCP. To test this hypothesis, male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with PCP (4.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, twice a day for 7 consecutive days) or saline were tested in behavioral and cognitive tasks 7 days after injections. The PCP group showed increased amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg)-stimulated locomotor activity, and exhibited a greater number of errors in the double Y-maze memory task, when compared with controls. Subchronic PCP treatment increased [H]muscimol-binding sites and decreased affinity for [H]muscimol binding in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum in comparison with controls. There were no changes in the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase or the GABA membrane transporter protein. These data show that subchronic PCP administration induces an impaired performance of a previously learned task and an enhanced response to amphetamine in the rat. The observed changes in GABAA receptors in the rat brain are consistent with the notion that alterations in GABAergic receptor function contribute to the behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with repeated exposure to PCP.",M3
19948149,"The novel neurotensin analog NT69L blocks phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced increases in locomotor activity and PCP-induced increases in monoamine and amino acids levels in the medial prefrontal cortex.Schizophrenia is a life-long, severe, and disabling brain disorder that requires chronic pharmacotherapy. Because current antipsychotic drugs do not provide optimal therapy, we have been developing novel treatments that focus on receptors for the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT). NT69L, an analog of neurotensin(8-13), acts like an atypical antipsychotic drug in several dopamine-based animal models used to study schizophrenia. Another current animal model utilizes non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA/glutamate receptor, such as the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP). In the present study, we investigated the effects of NT69L on PCP-induced behavioral and biochemical changes in the rat. The top of an activity chamber was modified to allow us to perform microdialysis in rat brain, while simultaneously recording the locomotor activity of a rat. PCP injection significantly increased activity as well as the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, dopamine (DA), and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pretreating with NT69L blocked the PCP-induced hyperactivity as well as the increase of DA, 5-HT, NE, and glutamate in mPFC. Interestingly and unexpectedly, NT69L markedly increased glycine levels, while PCP was without effect on glycine levels. Thus, NT69L showed antipsychotic-like effects in this glutamate-based animal model for studying schizophrenia. Previous work from our group suggests that NT69L also has antipsychotic-like effects in dopaminergic and serotonergic rodent models. Taken together, these data suggest that NT69L in particular and NT receptor agonists in general, will be useful as broad-spectrum antipsychotic drugs.",M3
19897002,"Opposite effect of phencyclidine on activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) in juvenile and adult limbic rat brain regions.The psychotomimetic effect of NMDA antagonists such as phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) in humans spurred the hypoglutamatergic theory of schizophrenia. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating schizophrenia-like behavioral and molecular changes following PCP administration to adult or neonatal animals. However, schizophrenia is believed to develop in part due to neurodevelopmental dysfunction during adolescence. Therefore, the effects of PCP in juvenile animals may better reflect the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, we compare the effect of PCP (5mg/kg/day for 5 days) on activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and parvalbumin mRNA expression in juvenile and adult rats. Arc is a marker for excitatory neurotransmission. Parvalbumin is a marker for GABAergic neurotransmission, known to be reduced in postmortem brains of schizophrenics. PCP reduced parvalbumin mRNA expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (VLO) and shell of the nucleus accumbens (ACCshell) in both juvenile and adult rats. Contrarily, PCP produced opposite effects on Arc mRNA expression in the mPFC, VLO and ACCshell, leading to decreased expression in juvenile and increased expression in adult rats. The differential effect of PCP in juvenile and adult rats may be caused by the immature functional state of the prefrontal cortex in juvenile rats. These results demonstrate differences between the effects of PCP in juvenile and adult rats. The decrease in Arc mRNA in juvenile rats corresponds best with the proposed  hypofrontality  in schizophrenia, suggesting the merits of using PCP in juvenile animals as a model for schizophrenia, as this would relate better to the typical onset and clinical features of schizophrenia.",M3
19887077,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor prevents phencyclidine-induced apoptosis in developing brain by parallel activation of both the ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways.Phencyclidine is an N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blocker that has been reported to induce neuronal apoptosis during development and schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats later in life. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to prevent neuronal death caused by NMDAR blockade, but the precise mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in BDNF protection of <e>PCP</e>-induced apoptosis in corticostriatal organotypic cultures. It was observed that BDNF inhibited PCP-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent fashion. BDNF effectively prevented PCP-induced inhibition of the ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways and suppressed GSK-3beta activation. Blockade of either PI-3K/Akt or ERK activation abolished BDNF protection. Western blot analysis revealed that the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the PI-3K/Akt pathway, but had no effect on the ERK pathway. Similarly, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the ERK pathway, but not the PI-3K/Akt pathway. Co-application of LY294002 and PD98059 had no additional effect on BDNF-evoked activation of Akt or ERK. However, concurrent exposure to PD98059 and LY294002 caused much greater inhibition of BDNF-evoked phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at serine 9 than did LY294002 alone. Finally, either BDNF or GSK-3beta inhibition prevented PCP-induced suppression of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that the protective effect of BDNF against PCP-induced apoptosis is mediated by parallel activation of the PI-3K/Akt and ERK pathways, most likely involves inhibition of GSK-3beta and activation of CREB.",M3
19864614,"Attenuation of phencyclidine-induced object recognition deficits by the combination of atypical antipsychotic drugs and pimavanserin (ACP 103), a 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptor inverse agonist.Subchronic administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), in rodents has been shown to produce impairment in novel object recognition (NOR), a model of visual learning and memory. We tested the hypothesis that the selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonists, pimavanserin and (R)-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl]-4-piperidinemethanol (M100907), would potentiate subeffective doses of atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) to reverse the NOR deficits. Female rats received vehicle or PCP (2 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout. Pimavanserin (3 mg/kg) or M100907 (1 mg/kg) alone, or four atypicial APDs, risperidone (0.05-0.1 mg/kg), melperone (1-3 mg/kg), olanzapine (1-2 mg/kg), or N-desmethylclozapine (1-2 mg/kg), and the typical APD, haloperidol (0.05-0.1 mg/kg), were administered alone, or in combination with pimavanserin or M100907, before NOR testing. The exploration times of objects during 3-min acquisition and retention trials, separated by a 1-min interval, were compared by analysis of variance. Vehicle-, but not PCP-treated, animals, explored the novel object significantly more than the familiar in the retention trial (p &lt; 0.05-0.01). Pretreatment with the higher doses of the atypical APDs, but not pimavanserin, M100907, or haloperidol alone, reversed the effects of PCP. The effect of risperidone was blocked by haloperidol pretreatment. Coadministration of pimavanserin or M100907, with ineffective doses of the atypical APDs, but not haloperidol, also reversed the PCP-induced deficit in NOR. These results support the importance of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptor blockade relative to D(2) receptor blockade in the ability of atypicals to ameliorate the effect of subchronic PCP, a putative measure of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.",M3

Male rats were trained to intravenously self-administer the cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN; 12.5 microg/kg/infusion) or vehicle; they subsequently received acute or chronic-intermittent intraperitoneal administration of the non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP; 2.5mg/kg) or saline. We report that WIN self-administration attenuates PCP-induced deficits in (i) prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, (ii) cognitive skills, and (iii) sociability, suggesting that cannabinoid consumption can ameliorate the schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations caused by PCP. A parallel study performed in animals receiving WIN on a non-voluntary basis (experimenter-given) confirmed an ameliorating effect of cannabinoid administration on the symptoms of schizophrenia induced by PCP.",M3
19853622,"Altered adult locomotor activity in rats from phencyclidine treatment on postnatal days 7, 9 and 11, but not repeated ketamine treatment on postnatal day 7.Neonatal ketamine (KET) or phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment can trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in rodents. Previously, we described KET- and PCP-induced altered body weight and home cage, slant board and forelimb hang behaviors in preweaning rats (Boctor et al., 2008). In that study, L-carnitine (LC) attenuated the KET-induced behavioral alterations and body weight decrements. The four subcutaneous (sc) treatment groups were: (1) saline; (2) 10 mg/kg PCP on PNDs 7, 9 and 11; (3) 20 mg/kg KET (6 injections; one every 2h on PND 7); or (4) a regimen of KET and 250 mg/kg LC (KLC) both administered on PND 7, with additional 250 mg/kg doses of LC on PNDs 8-11. A portion of each treatment group was evaluated for postweaning behaviors which included grip strength and motor coordination (postnatal days (PNDs) 22 or 71), locomotor sensitization (PND 42), spatial alternation (PNDs 22-70) and residential running wheel activity (PNDs 72-77). On PND 42 or 78, whole and regional brain weights were measured. Grip strength and motor coordination were unaffected at either age by neonatal treatment. On PND 42, neonatally treated KET- or KLC-treated rats responded to a challenge of 5mg/kg KET with activity similar to controls that received the same challenge. Neonatal PCP treatment, however, induced significant sensitization to a challenge of 3mg/kg PCP on PND 42 relative to controls that received the same challenge, causing increased activity which was especially profound in females. Performance on a continuous spatial alternation task requiring a  win-shift, lose-stay  strategy appeared unaffected by neonatal KET or KLC treatment. PCP treatment, however, caused significantly increased random responding and shorter choice latencies. In addition, neonatal PCP treatment elevated light and dark period running wheel activity and reduced PND 42 and 78 body and whole brain weights. These findings provide further evidence that PCP treatment on PNDs 7, 9, and 11 causes subtle cognitive deficits and long-term alterations in activity that are unrelated to deficits in grip strength or motor coordination. Further, repeated KET treatment on PND 7 does not appear to result in severe behavioral modifications.",M3
19851757,"Sertindole improves sub-chronic <e>PCP</e>-induced reversal learning and episodic memory deficits in rodents: involvement of 5-HT(6) and 5-HT (2A) receptor mechanisms.AIM: This study examined the efficacy of sertindole in comparison with a selective 5-HT(6) and a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist to reverse sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP)-induced cognitive deficits in female rats. METHODS: In the first test, adult female hooded Lister rats were trained to perform an operant reversal learning task to 90% criterion. After training, rats were treated with PCP at 2 mg/kg (i.p.) or vehicle twice daily for 7 days, followed by 7 days washout. For the second test, novel object recognition (NOR), a separate batch of rats, had the same sub-chronic PCP dosing regime and washout period. In reversal learning, rats were treated acutely with sertindole, the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100.907 or the selective 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist SB-742457. RESULTS: The PCP-induced selective reversal learning deficit was significantly improved by sertindole, M100.907 and SB-742457. Sertindole also significantly improved the sub-chronic PCP-induced deficit in NOR, a test of episodic memory following a 1 min and 1 h inter-trial interval. In vivo binding studies showed that the dose-response relationship for sertindole in this study most closely correlates with affinity for 5-HT(6) receptor in vivo binding in striatum, although contribution from binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors in vivo in cortex may also provide an important mechanism. CONCLUSION: The efficacies of selective 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists suggest potential mechanisms mediating the effects of sertindole, which has high affinity for these 5-HT receptor subtypes. The sertindole-induced improvement in cognitive function in this animal model suggests relevance for the management of cognitive deficit symptoms in schizophrenia.",M3
19822174,"Positive modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors reverses sub-chronic <e>PCP</e>-induced deficits in the novel object recognition task in rats.Cognitive deficits are a major clinical unmet need in schizophrenia. The psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine (PCP) is widely applied in rodents to mimic symptoms of schizophrenia, including cognitive deficits. Previous studies have shown that sub-chronic PCP induces an enduring episodic memory deficit in female Lister Hooded rats in the novel object recognition (NOR) task. Here we show that positive modulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) mediated glutamate transmission alleviates cognitive deficits induced by sub-chronic PCP treatment. Female Lister hooded rats were treated sub-chronically with either vehicle (0.9% saline) or PCP (2mg/kg two doses per day for 7 days), followed by a 7 days washout period. 30 min prior to the acquisition trial of the NOR task animals were dosed with either vehicle, CX546 (10, 40 or 80 mg/kg) or CX516 (0.5, 2.5, 10, 40 or 80 mg/kg). Our results show that sub-chronic PCP treatment induced a significant decrease in the discrimination index (DI) and both ampakines CX546 and CX516 were able to reverse this disruption of object memory in rats in the novel object recognition task. These data suggest that positive AMPAR modulation may represent a mechanism for treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",M3
19761795,"Chronic infusion of <e>PCP</e> via osmotic mini-pumps: a new rodent model of cognitive deficit in schizophrenia characterized by impaired attentional set-shifting (ID/ED) performance.The identification of animal disease-like models for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia is of central importance to the successful development of pharmacological therapies for psychosis resulting in a functional outcome in patients. Executive function is one of the most severely affected cognitive domains in schizophrenia that remains inadequately treated by existing therapies. The rat attentional set-shifting (or intra-dimensional-extra-dimensional (ID/ED)) task has been developed to test executive function in rodents and successful translation of pre-clinical data into the clinical setting now depends on the identification of a predictive animal disease-like model. The present study investigates whether a continuous 14-day mini-pump infusion of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) leads to a deficit in the ID/ED task, and subsequently evaluates the effect of modafinil in this model. Lister hooded rats were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic mini-pumps containing saline or PCP (15 mg/kg/day) for 14 days followed by a 7-day drug-free recovery phase. Rats were then tested in the ID/ED task following an acute injection of either vehicle or modafinil. PCP-treated animals displayed a selective deficit at the ED shift stage resembling that observed in schizophrenic patients. This deficit was reversed by an acute injection of modafinil. The PCP-induced impairment and its reinstatement by modafinil are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that described earlier by our group following sub-chronic intraperitoneal PCP administration, indicative that sub-chronic PCP infusion via osmotic mini-pumps may represent an attractive alternative to the systemic administration protocols generally employed to date.",M3
19744833,"Evaluation of the antipsychotic effect of bi-acetylated l-stepholidine (l-SPD-A), a novel dopamine and serotonin receptor dual ligand.Bi-acetylated l-stepholidine (l-SPD-A), a novel derivate of l-stepholidine (l-SPD), possesses a pharmacological profile of D(1)/5-HT(1A) agonism and D(2) antagonism. In the present study, we examined the potential antipsychotic effect of l-SPD-A in a phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced rat model of schizophrenia. Pretreatment with l-SPD-A blocked acute PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and reversed prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits. Chronic l-SPD-A administration (i.p., 10mg/kg/day for 14 days) improved social interaction and novel object recognition impairments in rats that were pretreated with PCP (i.p., 5mg/kg/day for 14 days). Moreover, in a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) test, l-SPD-A, with either i.p. or oral administration, significantly decreased active avoidance without affecting the escape response of rats. Importantly, compared to that of the parent compound l-SPD, l-SPD-A showed stronger suppression of CARs. Lastly, using a [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, we demonstrated that l-SPD-A improved impaired dopamine D(1) receptor function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in chronic PCP-treated rats. Taken together, these results indicate that l-SPD-A was not only effective against the hyperactivity, but also improved the sensorimotor gating deficit, social withdrawal and cognitive impairment in an animal model of schizophrenia. The present data suggest that l-SPD-A, a potential neurotransmitter stabilizer, is a promising novel candidate drug for the treatment of schizophrenia.",M3
19721235,"Neonatal phencyclidine treatment in mice induces behavioral, histological and neurochemical abnormalities in adulthood.We investigated the involvement of glutamic acid in neural development by injecting phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) into neonatal ICR mice. Neonatal mice were injected with PCP at 10 mg/kg or saline on postnatal days 7, 9 and 11, and their behavioral, anatomical and neurochemical changes were analyzed in adulthood. PCP-treated mice exhibited an increase in PCP-induced hyperactivity and impairments of spatial working memory and social interaction behavior. The impairment of social interaction behavior was significantly reversed by administration of clozapine, D-cycloserine, flumazenil, or SHC50911, a gamma-aminobutyrate B (GABA(B)) receptor antagonist. A decrease in the number of parvalbumin-positive cells and spine density in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus were evident in the brains of PCP-treated mice. Measurement of brain monoamine and their metabolite contents in adulthood indicated brain area-dependent and neurotransmitter-specific changes in monoamine metabolism. These findings suggest that neonatal treatment with PCP in mice leads to enhanced sensitivity to PCP and impairment of spatial working memory and social interaction behaviors in adulthood, which may be associated with reduced spine density and GABAergic interneurons and changes in monoamine metabolism. Furthermore, pharmacologic experiments suggest the potential applicability of neonatally PCP-treated mice as a useful animal model for new antipsychotic drug screening.",M3
19716985,"Evaluation of NMDA receptor models of schizophrenia: divergences in the behavioral effects of sub-chronic <e>PCP</e> and MK-801.The hypothesis of hypo-functionality of NMDA receptors in schizophrenia originates from the observation that administration of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) induces psychotic states that closely resemble schizophrenic symptoms and that persist after drug discontinuation. A large number of animal studies have used PCP and the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) almost interchangeably to model schizophrenia. However, PCP interacts with pharmacological targets other than NMDA receptors that are not affected by MK-801. In addition, although acute administration of either compound produces similar effects in animals, there is little information whether withdrawal from chronic MK-801 causes behavioral deficits that mimic schizophrenia symptoms as in the case of PCP. To clarify this issue, we compared the following behaviors in rats subjected to withdrawal from sub-chronic administration (2 x 7 days) of either PCP (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.): (1) working memory in a variable-delayed alternation task in a T-maze, (2) social interaction, and (3) motor activity in response to a (a) novel environment, (b) mild stressor, and (c) d-amphetamine challenge. Withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP caused a delay-dependent impairment of working memory, reduced social interaction and enhanced d-amphetamine-induced motor activity. These results were not replicated in animals sub-chronically treated with MK-801, which displayed only a slight decrease in social interaction. These data suggest that pharmacological antagonism at NMDA receptors is not sufficient to explain the full spectrum of PCP psychotomimetic properties.",M3
19699183,"Effects of phencyclidine on auditory gating in the rat hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex.Sensory gating can be assessed using an auditory conditioning (C)-test (T) paradigm which measures the reduction in the auditory-evoked response produced by a test stimulus following a conditioning stimulus. Schizophrenic patients demonstrate absence of gating while dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This study examined the effect of the glutamate receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) on auditory gating in the CA3 region and dentate gyrus (DG) of rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Local field potential (LFP) activity was recorded simultaneously from CA3, DG and mPFC in isoflurane anaesthetised Lister hooded rats using in vivo electrophysiology. Paired auditory stimuli were presented binaurally over 128 trials. The effect of PCP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) on gating of the N2 LFP wave was assessed as the test:conditioning response amplitude ratio (T/C ratio); a value of &lt; or =50% was indicative of gating. Auditory gating of the N2 wave was observed in the CA3, DG and mPFC. PCP disrupted gating in all three areas with significant increases in test amplitudes (P&lt;0.001). Clozapine (5 mg/kg i.p) prevented the auditory gating deficits induced by PCP in the CA3, DG and mPFC. This study shows that PCP disrupts sensory gating in the CA3, DG and mPFC in the isoflurane anaesthetised rat. Similar deficits are observed in schizophrenic patients and the current method may provide an animal model with good predictive validity, a view substantiated by the fact that clozapine prevented the sensory gating deficits induced by PCP.",M3
19697013,"Impulsivity as a behavioral measure of withdrawal of orally delivered <e>PCP</e> and nondrug rewards in male and female monkeys.BACKGROUND: Withdrawal of phencyclidine (PCP), ethanol (ETOH), and other drugs reduces operant responding maintained by food. OBJECTIVES: Experiment 1 examined the effects of withdrawing daily short access (2 h) to drug on impulsivity for saccharin (SACC) using a delay discounting task and comparing male and female rhesus monkeys. Experiment 2 examined the effects of withdrawing a nondrug substance (e.g., food or SACC) on impulsivity for PCP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In experiment 1, either PCP or ETOH was available daily with water for 2 h under a fixed ratio 16 (FR 16) or FR 8 schedule, respectively. In a second component, SACC was available for 45 min under a delay discounting schedule. Next, water was substituted, and drug access was then restored. In experiment 2, PCP was available under a delay discounting schedule during food satiation or restriction or during concurrent SACC vs water access. RESULTS: In experiment 1, withdrawal of 0.5 mg/ml PCP increased impulsivity for SACC, but not SACC intake, in males and females. During 16% ETOH access, impulsivity for SACC was elevated compared to baseline water access, and it returned to baseline levels during ETOH withdrawal. In experiment 2, food restriction resulted in increased PCP intake in males and females and increases in impulsivity for PCP that were greater in males than in females. SACC withdrawal had no effect on impulsivity for PCP or PCP intake. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of PCP and reduced food access increased impulsivity for SACC or PCP, respectively. Impulsivity is a sensitive indicator of drug dependence.",M3
19656663,"Effects of quetiapine on phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice: a possible role of alpha1-adrenoceptors.Accumulating evidence suggests that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors may be involved in the mechanisms of action of some antipsychotic drugs. The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, on cognitive deficits in mice after repeated administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). Subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of quetiapine (1.0, 10, or 30 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated PCP (10 mg/kg/day for 10 days)-induced cognitive deficits in mice, in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, PCP (10 mg/kg)-induced cognitive deficits were also significantly ameliorated by subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1.0 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed that levels of two subtypes (alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)) of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors were significantly lower in the brains of PCP-treated mice than in those of saline-treated mice. These findings suggest that repeated PCP administration could decrease the density of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in mouse brain, and that subsequent subchronic administration of quetiapine might ameliorate PCP-induced cognitive deficits via alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Therefore, it is likely that antagonism at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors is involved in the mechanism underlying quetiapine's psychopharmacological action.",M3
19654040,"Differential role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits 2A and 2B in mediating phencyclidine-induced perinatal neuronal apoptosis and behavioral deficits.The mechanism underlying phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced apoptosis in perinatal rats and the development of schizophrenia-like behaviors is incompletely understood. We used antagonists for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptor to test the hypothesis that the behavioral and apoptotic effects of PCP are mediated by blockade of NR1/NR2A-containing receptors, rather than NR1/NR2B-containing receptors. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on PN7, PN9, and PN11 with PCP (10 mg/kg), PEAQX (NR2A-preferring antagonist; 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg), or ifenprodil (selective NR2B antagonist; 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) and sacrificed for measurement of caspase-3 activity (an index of apoptosis) or allowed to age and tested for locomotor sensitization to PCP challenge on PN28-PN35. PCP or PEAQX on PN7, PN9, and PN11 markedly elevated caspase-3 activity in the cortex; ifenprodil showed no effect. Striatal apoptosis was evident only after subchronic treatment with a high dose of PEAQX (20 mg/kg). Animals treated with PCP or PEAQX on PN7, PN9, and PN11 showed a sensitized locomotor response to PCP challenge on PN28-PN35. Ifenprodil treatment had no effect on either measure. Therefore, PCP blockade of cortical NR1/NR2A, rather than NR1/NR2B, appears to be responsible for PCP-induced apoptosis and the development of long-lasting behavioral deficits.",M3
19651169,"Schizophrenia-like GABAergic gene expression deficits in cerebellar Golgi cells from rats chronically exposed to low-dose phencyclidine.One of the most consistent findings in schizophrenia is the decreased expression of the GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD(67) and GAD(65) in specific interneuron populations. This dysfunction is observed in distributed brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In an effort to understand the mechanisms for this GABA deficit, we investigated the effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), which elicits schizophrenia-like symptoms in both humans and animal models, in a chronic, low-dose exposure paradigm. Adult rats were given PCP at a dose of 2.58 mg/kg/day i.p. for a month, after which levels of various GABAergic cell mRNAs and other neuromodulators were examined in the cerebellum by qRT-PCR. Administration of PCP decreased the expression of GAD(67), GAD(65), and the presynaptic GABA transporter GAT-1, and increased GABA(A) receptor subunits similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, we found that the mRNA levels of two Golgi cell selective NMDAR subunits, NR2B and NR2D, were decreased in PCP-treated rats. Furthermore, we localized the deficits in GAD(67) expression solely to these interneurons. Slice electrophysiological studies showed that spontaneous firing of Golgi cells was reduced by acute exposure to low-dose PCP, suggesting that these neurons are particularly vulnerable to NMDA receptor antagonism. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to low levels of PCP in rats mimics the GABAergic alterations reported in the cerebellum of patients with schizophrenia (Bullock et al., 2008. Am. J. Psychiatry 165, 1594-1603), further supporting the validity of this animal model.",M3
19629447,"Role of 5-HT receptor mechanisms in sub-chronic <e>PCP</e>-induced reversal learning deficits in the rat.RATIONALE: 5-HT receptor mechanisms have been suggested to mediate improvements in cognition in schizophrenia. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of 5-HT receptor mechanisms in sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP)-induced reversal learning deficits in female rats, a task of relevance to schizophrenia. METHODS: Adult female hooded Lister rats were trained to perform an operant reversal learning task and then received sub-chronic PCP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by 7-day washout. Rats then received an acute dose of the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist SB-269970A (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. In experiment 2, PCP-treated rats received the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB-243213A acutely (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. In experiment 3, PCP-treated rats received the 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, buspirone (0.15625, 0.3125, and 0.625 mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). RESULTS: In all experiments, sub-chronic PCP significantly impaired reversal phase performance (P &lt; 0.01-0.001), with no effect in the initial phase. SB-269970A at 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg significantly improved the PCP-induced deficit (P &lt; 0.05). SB-243213A also significantly attenuated the deficit at 10 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05). In experiment 3, buspirone attenuated the deficit with significant effects at 0.3125 and 0.625 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05). WAY-100635 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg produced a partial attenuation of buspirone's effect as buspirone (0.3125 mg/kg) in the presence of WAY-100635 did not significantly reverse the PCP-induced deficit. CONCLUSIONS: These studies implicate the role of 5-HT(7), 5-HT(2C), and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the improvement of cognitive dysfunction of relevance to schizophrenia.",M3
19607756,"Inhibition of fatty-acid amide hydrolase and CB1 receptor antagonism differentially affect behavioural responses in normal and <e>PCP</e>-treated rats.The 'cannabinoid hypothesis' of schizophrenia tulates that over-activity of the endocannabinoid system might contribute to the aetiology of schizophrenia. In keeping with this hypothesis, increased expression of CB1 receptors, elevation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and cannabinoid-induced cognitive changes have been reported in animal models of schizophrenia and psychotic patients. In this study we measured brain endocannabinoid levels and [35S]GTPgammaS binding stimulated by the CB receptor agonist CP55,940 in rats undergoing withdrawal from subchronic administration of phencyclidine (PCP), a well-established pharmacological model of schizophrenia. We also investigated whether systemic application of the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 or CB1 receptor blockade by AM251 affected the following PCP-induced behavioural deficits reminiscent of schizophrenia-like symptoms: (1) working-memory impairment (cognitive deficit), (2) social withdrawal (negative symptom), and (3) hyperactivity in response to d-amphetamine challenge (positive symptoms). PCP-treated rats showed increased endocannabinoid levels in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, whereas CB1 receptor expression and CP55,940-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding were unaltered. URB597 reversed the PCP-induced social withdrawal but caused social withdrawal and working-memory deficits in saline-treated rats that were comparable to those observed after PCP treatment. Administration of AM251 ameliorated the working-memory deficit in PCP-treated rats, but impaired working memory in saline-injected controls. Taken together, these results suggest that FAAH inhibition may improve negative symptoms in PCP-treated rats but produce deleterious effects in untreated animals, possibly by disturbing endocannabinoid tone. A similar pattern (beneficial for schizophrenia-related cognitive deficits, but detrimental under normal conditions) accompanies CB1 receptor blockade.",M3
19562941,"[Development of animal models for schizophrenia based on clinical evidence: expectation for psychiatrists]Schizophrenic patients show positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In humans, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, reproduces the schizophrenia-like psychosis including positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Ketamine, another non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, also reproduces a schizophrenia-like psychosis in healthy volunteers, and exaggerates the psychosis in schizophrenic patients. It has been hypothesized that insufficient glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop animal models of schizophrenia by using NMDA receptor antagonists such as PCP, ketamine and dizocilpine. In addition to pharmacological approaches, genetic approaches have been adopted to develop animal models of schizophrenia. The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene has been identified as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene based on linkage and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies and clinical data, demonstrating that risk SNPs impact on the hippocampal structure and function in clinical and functional roles of DISC1 are analyzed in many kinds of transgenic mice developed. In this review, we focused on PCP and DISC1 transgenic animal models of schizophrenia and summarized recent evidence from several investigators. The basic researchers would need to collaborate with clinical psychiatrists to develop appropriate animal models for schizophrenia based on clinical evidence.",M3
19519774,"Activation of dopamine D1 receptors blocks phencyclidine-induced neurotoxicity by enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic strength.Early postnatal blockade of NMDA receptors by phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) causes cortical apoptosis in animals. This is associated with the development of schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats later in life. Recent studies show that the mechanism involves a loss of neurotrophic support from the phosphoinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway, which is normally maintained by synaptic NMDA receptor activation. Here we report that activation of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) with dihydrexidine (DHX) prevents PCP-induced neurotoxicity in cortical neurons by enhancing the efficacy of NMDAergic synapses. DHX increases serine phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit through protein kinase A activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit via Src kinase. DHX enhances recruitment of NR1 and NR2B, but not NR2A, into synapses. DHX also facilitated the synaptic response in cortical slices and this was blocked by an NR2B antagonist. DHX pre-treatment of rat pups prior to PCP on postnatal days 7, 9 and 11 inhibited PCP-induced caspase-3 activation on PN11 and deficits in pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle measured on PN 26-28. In summary, these data demonstrate that PCP-induced deficits in NMDA receptor function, neurotoxicity and subsequent behavioral deficits may be prevented by D1R activation in the cortex and further, it is suggested that D1R activation may be beneficial in treating schizophrenia.",M3

The results showed that, II can produce more analgesic effects in the tail immersion test (as a model of acute thermal pain) in comparison to the PCP with a marked significant increase in tail immersion latency (15, 40 and 45 min after injection) but for III, only slight analgesic effects (15, 35 and 40 min after injection) was seen (without significant differences between pain thresholds).",M3
19463700,"Ultrasonic vocalisations explain unexpected effects on pre-pulse inhibition responses in rats chronically pre-treated with phencyclidine.Deficits in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI-indicative of psychosis in humans) can be replicated in rats using the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). Ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) produced by rats in response to acoustic startle are indicative of heightened anxiety; here we tested the predictive validity of USVs as an indicator of PPI. Male juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10) were treated for 14 days with either PCP (5mg/kg i.p.) or saline controls (1 ml/kg i.p.). PPI responses and USVs were recorded on days 16 and 19. PCP-treated rats showed decreased PPI performance on day 16 compared to controls; an observation that was unexpectedly reversed on day 19. Call parameters indicated that both treatment groups experienced similar levels of anxiety in response to the PPI paradigm on day 16. On day 19, the controls showed increased call duration and latency to onset (LtO) of calling, but decreased in the total number of calls produced compared to day 16. The calling period was significantly reduced compared to PCP-treated animals on say 19, whilst the LtO and duration were significantly increased. These changes were considered indicative of heightened levels of anxiety, most likely due to inadvertent fear conditioning (supported by reduced PPI performance) acquired during PPI testing. In contrast, the stability of USV characteristics emitted by PCP treated animals likely signified the detrimental effects of chronic PCP treatment on working memory. These results suggest that USVs are a valuable additional measure during PPI testing, helping to explain the unexpected results from our control group.",M3
19455435,"Subchronic effects of phencyclidine on dopamine and serotonin receptors: implications for schizophrenia.Changes in representative dopamine (D(1), D(2), and D(4)) and serotonin (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A)) receptors that have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia were autoradiographically quantified after subchronic phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment (2 mg/kg for 7 days, bi-daily followed by 7 days drug free). This treatment has consistently induced robust and long-lasting cognitive deficits in adult rats, although the molecular mechanisms contributing to PCP-induced cognitive deficits remain undefined. Repeated PCP treatment significantly decreased labeling of D(1) receptors in the medial and lateral caudate-putamen (22% and 23%, respectively) and increased 5HT(1A) receptor binding in the medial-prefrontal (26%) and dorsolateral-frontal cortex (30%). No changes in D(1) or 5HT(1A) receptors were detected in other brain regions. These findings suggest that downregulation of striatal D(1) receptors and upregulation of cortical 5HT(1A) receptors may contribute to PCP-induced impairment of cognitive functions in rats. Subchronic PCP treatment did not alter levels of D(2), D(4), and 5HT(2A) receptors in all brain regions examined, which suggests a minimal role for these receptors in mediating subchronic actions of PCP in adult rats.",M3
19433073,"Phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice are ameliorated by subsequent subchronic administration of donepezil: role of sigma-1 receptors.This study was undertaken to examine the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil and physostigmine) on cognitive deficits in mice after repeated administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). In the novel object recognition test, PCP (10 mg/kg/day for 10 days)-induced cognitive deficits were significantly improved by subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of donepezil (1.0 mg/kg/day), but not donepezil (0.1 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, the effect of donepezil (1.0 mg/kg/day) on PCP-induced cognitive deficits was significantly antagonized by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100 (1.0 mg/kg/day), suggesting the role of sigma-1 receptors in the active mechanisms of donepezil. In contrast, PCP-induced cognitive deficits were not improved by subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of physostigmine (0.25 mg/kg/day). Moreover, repeated administration of PCP significantly caused the reduction of sigma-1 receptors in the hippocampus. The present study suggests that agonistic activity of donepezil at sigma-1 receptors plays a role in the active mechanisms of donepezil on PCP-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Therefore, it is likely that donepezil would be potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",M3
19425051,"Prenatal phencyclidine exposure alters hippocampal cell proliferation in offspring rats.Multiple case reports have described pregnancy in phencyclidine hydrochloride (<e>PCP</e>) abusers. Characteristic clinical symptoms of PCP-exposed infants have revealed neurobehavioral or physical abnormalities. We designed this study to evaluate whether chronic prenatal exposure to PCP during the last 2 weeks of gestation in rats produces alterations of hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. Rats received repeated subcutaneous injection of PCP (5 mg/kg) once daily during the last 2 weeks of gestation. Control animals received subcutaneous injection of physiological saline during gestation. Dams receiving repeated PCP administrations showed markedly increased locomotor activities on days 1, 5, and 10 during the last 2 weeks of gestation. At 21 days after birth, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells of offspring were counted in the granule cell layer (GCL) and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. The numbers of BrdU-positive cells in the GCL in male and female offspring of the PCP-treated group were significantly increased by approximately 77% compared with those from the control group. At 56 days, the number of surviving BrdU-positive cells also remained to be increased by 74% in the GCL in PCP-treated group. At 21 days, locomotor activities of offspring in the PCP-treated group were significantly decreased by approximately 30% compared with those in the control group. However, neuronal differentiation of newly formed cells and cell survival were not influenced at 5 weeks after BrdU injections. Some altered biochemical or physiological conditions of offspring from dams receiving repeated PCP injections during pregnancy could influence changes in cell proliferation in the GCL of offspring during early development. Changes to cell proliferation in the hippocampus may affect behavioral abnormalities during infancy in offspring.",M3
19390843,"Reversal of cognitive deficits by an ampakine (CX516) and sertindole in two animal models of schizophrenia--sub-chronic and early postnatal <e>PCP</e> treatment in attentional set-shifting.RATIONALE: Therapies treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia especially deficits in executive functioning are not available at present. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluated the effect of ampakine CX516 in reversing deficits in executive functioning as represented in two animal models of schizophrenia and assessed by a rodent analog of the intradimensional-extradimensional (ID-ED) attentional set-shifting task. The second generation antipsychotic, sertindole, provided further validation of the schizophrenia-like disease models. METHODS: Animals were subjected to (a) sub-chronic or (b) early postnatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment regimes: (a) Administration of either saline or PCP (5 mg/kg, intraperitonally b.i.d. for 7 days) followed by a 7-day washout period and testing on day 8. (b) On postnatal days (PNDs) 7, 9, and 11, rats were subjected to administration of either saline or PCP (20 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)) and tested on PNDs 56-95, after reaching adulthood. The single test session required rats to dig for food rewards in a series of discriminations following acute administration of either vehicle, or CX516 (5-40 mg/kg, s.c.), or sertindole (1.25 mg/kg, perorally). RESULTS: The specific extradimensional deficits produced by sub-chronic or early postnatal PCP treatment were significantly attenuated by sertindole and dose-dependently by CX516. CONCLUSION: Findings here further establish PCP treatment as model of executive functioning deficits related to schizophrenia and provide evidence that direct glutamatergic interventions could improve these, when assessed in the ID-ED attentional set-shifting task.",M3
19353758,"The five choice serial reaction time task: comparison between Sprague-Dawley and Long-Evans rats on acquisition of task, and sensitivity to phencyclidine.The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) allows examination of multiple aspects of cognition/executive functions (attention/impulsivity/ perseveration). Most 5-CSRTT studies are performed with pigmented (i.e. Long-Evans: LE) rats; however, albino strains (i.e. Sprague-Dawley: SD) are more commonly used in behavioural pharmacology experiments. Hence, we compared 5-CSRTT performances of SD and LE rats and their sensitivity to acute phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>, 1-2.5 mg/kg). SD required significantly fewer sessions(35 versus 50) than LE rats for task acquisition, especially at shortest stimulus light duration (1 s). However,once trained, under vehicle conditions, both strains performed similarly. In contrast, PCP treatment differentially affected the two strains. Thus, whilst percentage of accuracy was decreased for both strains, in SD rats number of premature responses was more markedly decreased, whereas omissions and latency time to correct responses were more notably increased. In addition, PCP monotonically diminished in SD, but augmented (1-1.5 mg/kg) in LE rats compulsive responding. To summarize, under our experimental conditions, the SD offer advantages over LE strain for speed of acquisition of 5-CSRTT. Once trained, basal performances of both strains were equivalent and stable enough for challenge with pharmacological compounds. However, PCP differentially affected the strains on several parameters considered.",M3

In this study, we used single-voxel (1)H-MRS to investigate neurochemical changes in rat prefrontal cortex in vivo before and after an acute injection of PCP. A short-echo time sequence (STEAM) was used to acquire spectra in a 32-microL voxel positioned in the prefrontal cortex area of 12 rats anesthetized with isoflurane. Data were acquired for 30 min before and for 140 min after a bolus of PCP (10 mg/kg, n = 6) or saline (n = 6). Metabolites were quantified with the LCModel. Time courses for 14 metabolites were obtained with a temporal resolution of 10 min. The glutamine/glutamate ratio was significantly increased after PCP injection (p &lt; 0.0001, pre- vs. post-injection), while the total concentration of these two metabolites remained constant. Glucose was transiently increased (+70%) while lactate decreased after the injection (both p &lt; 0.0001). Lactate, but not glucose and glutamine, returned to baseline levels after 140 min. These results show that an acute injection of PCP leads to changes in glutamate and glutamine concentrations, similar to what has been observed in schizophrenic patients, and after ketamine administration in humans. MRS studies of this pharmacological rat model may be useful for assessing the effects of potential anti-psychotic drugs in vivo.",M3

The aim was to investigate the efficacy of the D(1)-like receptor agonist, SKF-38393, to improve PCP-induced deficits in the novel object recognition (NOR) and operant reversal learning (RL) tasks. Rats received either sub-chronic PCP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout. Rats were either tested in NOR or the RL tasks. In NOR, vehicle rats successfully discriminated between novel and familiar objects, an effect abolished in PCP-treated rats. SKF-38393 (6 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the PCP-induced deficit (P&lt;0.01) an effect significantly antagonised by SCH-23390 (0.05 mg/kg), a D(1)-like receptor antagonist (P&lt;0.01). In the RL task sub-chronic PCP significantly reduced performance in the reversal phase (P&lt;0.001); SKF-38393 (6.0 mg/kg) improved this PCP-induced deficit, an effect antagonised by SCH-23390 (P&lt;0.05). These results suggest a role for D(1)-like receptors in improvement of cognitive function in paradigms of relevance to schizophrenia.",M3
19254430,"Developmentally regulated and thalamus-selective induction of leiomodin2 gene by a schizophrenomimetic, phencyclidine, in the rat.The onset of schizophrenia and the schizophrenomimetic effects of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine, rarely occur during infancy and childhood, suggesting that schizophrenia-related neuron circuits and molecules in the brain might show an age-related response to an NMDA receptor antagonist. By using a DNA microarray technique, we have identified the developmentally regulated <e>PCP</e>-inducible gene leiomodin2 (Lmod2) that encodes a tropomyosin-binding actin-capping protein enriched in the cardiac and skeletal muscles. PCP caused an increase in the thalamic amounts of Lmod2 transcripts at postnatal days (PD) 32 and 50 without affecting them at PD 8, 13, 20 and 24, while the NMDA antagonist failed to produce a significant change in the gene expression in the adult heart. In-situ hybridization analysis revealed that the basal and PCP-induced expression of the Lmod2 gene is almost confined to the lateral and anterior nuclei of the thalamus among the brain regions at PD 50. The PCP-induced up-regulation of Lmod2 mRNAs in the adult thalamus was mimicked totally (also up-regulated) by another NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine, and partly by the indirect dopamine agonist, methamphetamine. Moreover, pretreatment with a D(2)-preferring dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, partially antagonizes the increasing effects of PCP on thalamic Lmod2 gene expression. These findings suggest that Lmod2 might be involved in the pathophysiology of the age-dependent onset of drug-induced schizophrenia-like psychosis and schizophrenia and that the limited thalamic nuclei expressing the Lmod2 gene could compose the neuron circuits that are specifically disturbed in these mental disorders.",M3
19245799,"Brief exposure to methamphetamine (METH) and phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) during late development leads to long-term learning deficits in rats.Exposure to methamphetamine (METH) and phencyclidine (PCP) during early development is thought to produce later behavioral deficits. We postulated that exposure to METH and PCP during later development would produce similar behavioral deficits, particularly learning deficits in adulthood. Wistar rats were treated with METH (9 mg/kg), PCP (9 mg/kg), or saline during later development, postnatal days (PD) 50-51, and subsequent behavioral changes were examined including: locomotor activity during the acute drug state (PD 50-51) and the post-drug phase (PD 50-80); social interaction on PD 54-80; and spatial discrimination and reversal in adulthood (after PD 90). METH and PCP differentially affected locomotion during the acute state, but not during the post-drug phase. METH decreased social interaction throughout tests two weeks after drug treatment, whereas PCP decreased social interaction only during the first 8 min of tests. Neither METH nor PCP impaired initial acquisition of spatial discrimination. However, reversal was significantly impaired by PCP, whereas METH produced a mild deficit, compared to controls. Our data provide evidence that exposure to PCP and METH during later development lead to enduring cognitive deficits in adulthood. Selective impairment of reversal may reflect neurological damage in the prefrontal cortex due to early exposure to drugs.",M3
19233218,"alpha(7) Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation prevents behavioral and molecular changes induced by repeated phencyclidine treatment.The core features of schizophrenia include deficits in cognitive processes, such as attention and working memory, subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These deficits are believed to involve deficient neurotransmission through NMDA receptors, particularly on parvalbumin-containing interneurons, and administration of the NMDA-antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) in rodents is a well validated model of such cognitive deficits. Here we show that repeated PCP treatment (10 mg/kg/day for 10 days) decreased the expression of parvalbumin and synaptophysin mRNA in the mouse PFC, which corresponds to changes seen in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, PCP increased the basal mRNA expression in the PFC of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), a molecule involved in synaptic plasticity. These molecular changes produced by PCP were accompanied by a behavioral impairment as determined in a modified Y-maze test. Polymorphisms in the alpha(7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene have been linked to schizophrenia. Here we demonstrate that acute administration of the selective alpha(7) nAChR partial agonist SSR180711 dose-dependently reversed the behavioral impairment induced by PCP. Importantly, repeated co-administration of SSR180711 (3 mg/kg) with PCP prevented both the changes in parvalbumin, synaptophysin, and Arc mRNA expression in the PFC, and the behavioral impairment induced by PCP. These results are the first to demonstrate prevention of the deleterious effects induced by repeated PCP treatment. The behavioral and molecular effects of alpha(7) nAChR agonism in this model, particularly the prevention of a decline in parvalbumin mRNA expression, suggest an involvement of the alpha(7) nAChR not only in the symptomatic relief, but also the pathophysiology, of schizophrenia.",M3
19189879,"Behavioral changes in G72/G30 transgenic mice.Genetic studies have implicated the evolutionary novel, primates-specific gene locus G72/G30 in schizophrenia, bipolar and panic disorders. It encodes for a protein LG72 whose function has been controversially discussed as putative regulator of the peroxisomal enzyme D-amino-acid-oxidase (DAO), or as a mitochondrial protein, which promotes robust mitochondrial fragmentation in mammalian cell lines including human and rat primary neurons. Because of this conserved function we here have generated  humanized  BAC transgenic mice (G72Tg) expressing alternatively spliced G72 and G30 transcripts, and the LG72 protein. G72 expression is prominent in granular cells of the cerebellum, the hippocampus, the cortex and the olfactory bulb. Most strikingly, G72Tg mice displayed deficits in sensorimotor gating which could be reversed with haloperidol, increased sensitivity to <e>PCP</e>, motor-coordination deficits, increased compulsive behaviors and deficits in smell identification. These results demonstrate that expression of the human G72/G30 gene locus in mice produces behavioral phenotypes that are relevant to psychiatric disorders.",M3
19183964,"The discriminative stimulus effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate glycine-site ligands in NMDA antagonist-trained rats.RATIONALE: Many N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists produce phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-like side effects that limit their clinical utility. NMDA glycine-site antagonists may be less likely to produce these effects than other site-selective NMDA antagonists. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to compare the discriminative stimulus effects of novel NMDA glycine-site drugs to those of channel blocking and competitive NMDA antagonists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drug discrimination studies were performed in separate groups of rats trained with saline vs. PCP (2 mg/kg i.p.) or the competitive antagonist NPC 17742 (4 mg/kg i.p.) using a standard two-lever operant conditioning procedure under an FR32. RESULTS: Neither the partial glycine-site agonists aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid methyl ester and (+)-HA-966 nor the antagonists L701,324; MDL 100,458; MDL 100,748; MDL 103,371; MDL 104,472; MDL 105,519; MRZ 2/571; MRZ 2/576; and ACEA 0762 produced &gt;50% PCP-lever selection, though all were tested over a sufficient dose range to produce response rate decreasing effects. All of the antagonists, except MDL 100,458 and MDL 100,748, were also tested for NPC 17742-like effects, producing somewhat more variable results than in PCP-trained rats. ACEA-0762 produced full substitution for NPC 17742, whereas MDL 105,519 produced no substitution. The remaining compounds engendered between 20% and 80% drug-lever selection. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that NMDA glycine-site partial agonists and antagonists generally do not produce discriminative stimulus effects similar to those of representative NMDA channel blockers or competitive antagonists. This suggests that these NMDA glycine-site antagonists should be less likely to produce the undesirable behavioral side effects seen in clinical trials with many other NMDA antagonists.",M3
19179852,"Olanzapine and risperidone disrupt conditioned avoidance responding in phencyclidine-pretreated or amphetamine-pretreated rats by selectively weakening motivational salience of conditioned stimulus.The rat conditioned avoidance response model is a well-established preclinical behavioral model predictive of antipsychotic efficacy. All clinically approved antipsychotic drugs disrupt conditioned avoidance responding - a feature that distinguishes them from other psychotherapeutics. We previously showed that the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol disrupts avoidance responding by progressively attenuating the motivational salience of the conditioned stimulus (CS) in normal rats. In this study, using two pharmacological rat models of schizophrenia [e.g. phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) or amphetamine sensitization], we examined whether atypicals such as olanzapine or risperidone disrupt avoidance responding through the same behavioral mechanism. Rats were first pretreated with PCP, amphetamine, or saline under one of two different injection schedules for either 1 or 3 weeks. They were then trained to acquire avoidance responding to two types of CS (CS1 and CS2) that differed in their ability to predict the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. Finally, rats were tested repeatedly under olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or risperidone (0.33 mg/kg, subcutaneously) daily for 5 or 7 consecutive days. We found that repeated olanzapine or risperidone treatment produced a progressive across-session decline in avoidance responding to both CS1 and CS2. Olanzapine and risperidone disrupted the CS2 (a less salient CS) avoidance to a greater extent than the CS1 avoidance. Pretreatment with PCP and amphetamine did not affect the disruptive effect of olanzapine or risperidone on avoidance responding. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the atypical drugs olanzapine and risperidone, like the typical drug haloperidol, also disrupt avoidance responding primarily by attenuating the motivational salience of the CS.",M3
19166879,"The importance of nitric oxide in social dysfunction.Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder generally considered to encompass positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Increasing attention has been paid to the social cognitive deficits of the disorder as these dysfunctions are particularly handicapping, predictive of functional outcome and show poor treatment response. Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) is a psychotomimetic drug used to model the different aspects of schizophrenia in experimental animal models. PCP-induced cognitive deficits and hyperlocomotion may be blocked by pretreatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors in rodents. The present study was carried out to evaluate the acute effects of PCP and NO synthase inhibition on social interaction in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10mg/kg) and PCP (2mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats, which were then tested in pairs for social interactive behaviour. Twenty-four hours after the initial test a drug-free social interaction test was carried out to assess the rats' memory of the previous social interaction. The results showed that PCP reduced the time of social interaction on Day 1 compared to controls, and that pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, attenuated this reduction towards control levels. Neither locomotor activity, nor frequency of social interactions were affected by the PCP treatment, suggesting that the PCP-induced effects observed were not due to drug-induced stereotypies. In combination with increasing clinical evidence for the involvement of NO in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present results indicate that NO synthase inhibition may be a potentially new treatment strategy for alleviating social dysfunction in schizophrenia.",M3
19162135,"Phencyclidine affects firing activity of basolateral amygdala neurons related to social behavior in rats.Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and blunted affect, usually persist for a long period, making rehabilitation difficult. Many studies have demonstrated a close relationship between function of the amygdala and social behavior. Normal social behavior is disturbed in animals administered phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), which is now considered a reliable pharmacological model of schizophrenia. Recent studies have reported that disruption of social behavior in PCP-treated rats involved dysfunction of the amygdala. Disturbance of function of the amygdala has also been reported in schizophrenic patients. However, no study has yet examined the effects of PCP on the firing activity of amygdala neurons. In the present study, we recorded the unit activity of basolateral amygdala neurons while rats engaged in socially interactive behavior. After identifying the response properties of recorded neurons, we then recorded the same neurons with systemic PCP administration. Approximately half of the neurons recorded from exhibited an increase in spontaneous discharge rate during social interaction. Only a few neurons exhibited suppression of discharge rate during social interaction. Systemic administration of PCP induced long-lasting activation in half of the neurons that exhibited an increase in firing rate during social interaction. PCP activated half of basolateral amygdala neurons related to socially interactive behavior, and might in this fashion produce dysfunction of social behavior.",M3
19150227,"Excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission is chronically altered following perinatal NMDA receptor blockade.N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade in rodents induces behavioural and neurochemical changes reminiscent of schizophrenia symptoms and pathology. To examine how NMDA receptor blockade affects glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways when administered during early brain development, [3H]MK-801 and [3H]muscimol binding to NMDA and GABA(A) receptors was examined at four time-points following injections of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) or saline on postnatal days (PN)7, 9 and 11. [3H]MK-801 binding was significantly increased in PCP-treated rats in the thalamus from PN18 to PN96, in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices at PN32, and in the hippocampus at PN96. In a similar manner, [3H]muscimol binding was increased in PCP-treated rats in the thalamus and hippocampus from PN18 to PN96, and in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices at PN32. Glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission is therefore chronically altered by this treatment, which has relevance to disease processes that may be involved in schizophrenia.",M3
19145229,"Prefrontal GABA(B) receptor activation attenuates phencyclidine-induced impairments of prepulse inhibition: involvement of nitric oxide.Recent theories propose that both GABA and glutamate signaling are compromised in patients with schizophrenia. These deficits can be observed in several brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area extensively linked to the cognitive dysfunction in this disease and notably affected by NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of the nitric oxide (NO) pathways in the brain, particularly in the PFC, prevents a wide range of PCP-induced behavioral deficits including disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI). This study investigated the role of GABA(B) receptor signaling and NO in the effects of PCP on PPI. Mice received systemic or prefrontal injections of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (2.5-5 mg/kg and 1 mM) before PCP treatment (5 mg/kg) and were thereafter tested for PPI. GABA/NO interactions were studied by combining baclofen and the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (20 mg/kg) in subthreshold doses. The role of GABA(B) receptors for NO production in vivo was assessed using NO-sensors implanted into the rat PFC. PCP-induced PPI deficits were attenuated in an additive manner by systemic baclofen treatment, whereas prefrontal microinjections of baclofen completely blocked the effects of PCP, without affecting PPI per se. The combination of baclofen and L-NAME was more effective in preventing the effects of PCP than any compound by itself. Additionally, baclofen decreased NO release in the PFC in a dose-related manner. This study proposes a role for GABA(B) receptor signaling in the effects of PCP, with altered NO levels as a downstream consequence. Thus, prefrontal NO signaling mirrors an altered level of cortical inhibition that may be of importance for information processing deficits in schizophrenia.",M3
19144770,"Mechanistic analysis of the inactivation of cytochrome P450 2B6 by phencyclidine: effects on substrate binding, electron transfer, and uncoupling.Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) is a mechanism-based inactivator of cytochrome P450 (P450) 2B6. We have analyzed several steps in the P450 catalytic cycle to determine the mechanism of inactivation of P450 2B6 by PCP. Spectral binding studies show that binding of benzphetamine, a type I ligand, to P450 2B6 was significantly affected as a result of the inactivation, whereas binding of the inhibitor n-octylamine, a type II ligand, was not compromised. Binding of these ligands to P450 2B6 occurs in two phases. Stopped-flow spectral analysis of the binding kinetics of benzphetamine to PCP-inactivated 2B6 revealed a 15-fold decrease in the rate of binding during the second phase of the kinetics (k(1) = 5.0 s(-1), A(1) = 30%; k(2) = 0.02 s(-1), A(2) = 70%, where A(2) indicates the fractional magnitude of the second phase) compared with the native enzyme (k(1) = 8.0 s(-1), A(1) = 58%; k(2) = 0.3 s(-1), A(2) = 42%). Analysis of benzphetamine metabolism by the inactivated protein using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry showed that the rates of formation of nor-benzphetamine and hydroxylated nor-benzphetamine were decreased by 75 and 69%, respectively, whereas the rates of formation for amphetamine, hydroxybenzphetamine, and methamphetamine showed slight but statistically insignificant decreases after the inactivation. The rate of reduction of P450 2B6 by NADPH and reductase was decreased by 6-fold as a result of the modification by PCP. In addition, the extent of uncoupling of NADPH oxidation from product formation, a process leading to futile production of H(2)O(2), increased significantly during the metabolism of ethylbenzene as a result of the inactivation.",M3
19133297,"Effect of an NCAM mimetic peptide FGL on impairment in spatial learning and memory after neonatal phencyclidine treatment in rats.The FGL peptide is a neural cell adhesion molecule-derived fibroblast growth factor receptor agonist. FGL has both neurotrophic and memory enhancing properties. Neonatal phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11 has been shown to result in long-lasting behavioral abnormalities, including cognitive impairment relevant to schizophrenia. The present study investigated the effect of FGL on spatial learning and memory deficits induced by neonatal PCP treatment. Rat pups were treated with 30 mg/kg PCP on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11. Additionally, the rats were subjected to a chronic FGL treatment regimen where FGL was administered throughout development. Rats were tested as adults for spatial reference memory, reversal learning, and working memory in the Morris water maze. The PCP-treated rats demonstrated a robust impairment in working memory and reversal learning. However, the long-term memory component of the reference memory task was not affected by PCP. Chronic FGL treatment had no effect on the reversal learning impairment but ameliorated the working memory deficits almost to the levels of the control groups. In conclusion, the results suggest that the neonatal PCP treatment produced deficits in cognition relevant to schizophrenia. Moreover, working memory function was selectively protected by the neurotrophic peptide, FGL.",M3
19073421,"NMDA antagonist and antipsychotic actions in cortico-subcortical circuits.Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) abnormalities. Schizophrenic patients show a reduced performance in tasks engaging the PFC and a reduction of markers of cellular integrity and function. Non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists are widely used as pharmacological models of schizophrenia due to their ability to exacerbate schizophrenia symptoms in patients and to elicit psychotomimetic actions in healthy volunteers. Also, these drugs evoke behavioral alterations in experimental animals that resemble schizophrenia symptoms. The PFC seems to be a key target area for these agents. However, the cellular and network elements involved are poorly known. Cognitive deficits are of particular interest since an early antipsychotic-induced improvement in cognitive performance predicts a better long-term clinical outcome. Here we report that the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) induces a marked disruption of the activity of PFC. PCP administration increased the activity of a substantial proportion of pyramidal neurons, as evidenced by an increase in discharge rate and in c-fos expression. Examination of the effects of PCP on other brain areas revealed an increased c-fos expression in a number of cortical and subcortical areas, but notably in thalamic nuclei projecting to the PFC. The administration of classical (haloperidol) and/or atypical (clozapine) antipsychotic drugs reversed PCP effects. These results indicate that PCP induces a marked disruption of the network activity in PFC and that antipsychotic drugs may partly exert their therapeutic effect by normalizing hyperactive cortico-thalamocortical circuits.",M3
19046980,"Impaired social motivation and increased aggression in rats subchronically exposed to phencyclidine.Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment induces social withdrawal in the rat model of schizophrenia but little is known about the qualitative adequacy of behaviors displayed during interactions. Affiliative, avoidance, and aggressive behaviors were examined in rats 20 h after the 1st, the 8th, and the 15th injection of 10 mg/kg of PCP or of a saline vehicle. PCP treatment reduced the initiation of affiliative contacts with a control congener and increased aggressive responses, in the absence of drug outcomes on time spent in social interaction. These results suggest that subchronic PCP administration in rats affects perception and appraisal of social situations as well as motivation to interact. Such pathological behaviors are consistent with the social impairments characteristic of human schizophrenia.",M3
19038286,"Neonatal NMDA receptor antagonist treatments have no effects on prepulse inhibition of postnatal day 25 Sprague-Dawley rats.Glutamate activation of the NMDA receptor is essential for neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival. Treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine (KET) or phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), can trigger apoptosis in neonatal rats. However, L-carnitine (LC) treatment appears to prevent glutamate-induced toxicity in the developing CNS. Previously, we described altered preweaning behaviors (i.e., abnormal home cage, slant board and forelimb hang behaviors) resulting from neonatal PCP and KET treatment. Those adverse effects of KET were somewhat ameliorated by LC [Boctor SY, Wang C, Ferguson SA. Neonatal PCP is more potent than ketamine at modifying preweaning behaviors of Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicol Sci 2008;106:172-9]. Here, a portion of those subjects were evaluated for prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response at postnatal day (PND) 25 since previous reports described PCP-induced effects on this response. Rats were subcutaneously treated with: saline; 10 mg/kg PCP (1x/day) on PNDs 7, 9 and 11; 20 mg/kg KET (6 injections every 2h on PND 7); or a similar regimen of ketamine and 250 mg/kg LC on PND 7, with a single injection of 250 mg/kg LC on PNDs 8-11 (KLC). Male and female rats were assessed using a standard PPI paradigm with prepulses of 68, 78 and 82 dB. Body weight was decreased 17-21% and whole brain weight was decreased 10% in PCP-treated rats. Specifically, cerebellar weight was significantly less in PCP-treated rats relative to control. Despite the magnitude of those PCP-induced changes, startle response in normal pulse only trials and percent of PPI in PCP-, KET-, and KLC-treated groups were comparable to controls. Average latency to maximum startle was 2.6 ms less in females than males (p&lt;0.007); there were no other significant sex effects. The lack of neonatal PCP treatment on later PPI is similar to that reported by Rasmussen et al. [Rasmussen BA, O'Neil J, Manaye KF, Perry DC, Tizabi Y. Long-term effects of developmental PCP administration on sensorimotor gating in male and female rats. Psychopharmacology (Berl) 2007; 190: 43-9.], and indicates that neonatal PCP-induced effects on PPI [Wang C, McInnis J, Ross-Sanchez M, Shinnick-Gallagher P, Wiley JL, Johnson KM. Long-term behavioral and neurodegenerative effects of perinatal phencyclidine administration: implications for schizophrenia. Neuroscience 2001; 107: 535-50.] appear difficult to replicate.",M3
19026629,"Clozapine attenuates disruptions in response inhibition and task efficiency induced by repeated phencyclidine administration in the intracranial self-stimulation procedure.Currently available antipsychotic medications lack satisfactory effectiveness against several symptom clusters of schizophrenia, including affective symptoms (e.g., anhedonia) and cognitive deficits (e.g., impulsivity). Translational animal models analogous to these symptoms are necessary to provide insights into the neurobiological events underlying these impairments and allow the development of improved schizophrenia treatments. We investigated the effects of repeated administration of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, on performance in the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure, a test of reward function. We also explored how chronic treatment with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic with limited effectiveness on affective and cognitive schizophrenia symptoms, would affect PCP-induced disruptions of ICSS performance. A single injection of 2 mg/kg PCP elevated ICSS thresholds, suggesting a reward deficit. Repeated PCP administration (2 mg/kg once daily for 2 consecutive days followed by a 10-day drug free period, and then 5 consecutive days of 2 mg/kg PCP daily, s.c., 30 min pretreatment) resulted in a small, but significant, lowering of ICSS reward thresholds, indicating increased reward function. Chronic clozapine did not alter the effects of repeated PCP on ICSS thresholds. Repeated PCP also increased the number of extra and timeout responses performed during the ICSS procedure, reflecting disinhibition of inappropriate responding and decreased task efficiency. Chronic clozapine attenuated the increase in extra responses induced by repeated PCP and tended to reduce the PCP-induced increase in timeout responses. These results suggest that repeated PCP administration does not produce an anhedonia-like state resembling that seen in schizophrenia. However, the increased impulsivity and reduced task efficiency seen with repeated PCP administration, and the sensitivity of these effects to attenuation with an atypical antipsychotic, suggest that repeated PCP administration may be a useful inducing condition for eliciting cognitive deficits with relevance to schizophrenia.",M3
18991407,"Probing the structure of the affinity-purified and lipid-reconstituted torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.The Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the only member of the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) that is available in high abundance in a native membrane preparation. To study the structure of the other LGICs using biochemical and biophysical techniques, detergent solubilization, purification, and lipid reconstitution are usually required. To assess the effects of purification on receptor structure, we used the hydrophobic photoreactive probe 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[(125)I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([(125)I]TID) to compare the state-dependent photolabeling of the Torpedo nAChR before and after purification and reincorporation into lipid. For the purified nAChR, the agonist-sensitive photolabeling within the M2 ion channel domain of positions M2-6, M2-9, and M2-13, the agonist-enhanced labeling of deltaThr274 (deltaM2-18) within the delta subunit helix bundle, and the labeling at the lipid-protein interface (alphaMu4) were the same as for the nAChR in native membranes. However, addition of agonist did not enhance [(125)I]TID photolabeling of deltaIle288 within the deltaM2-M3 loop. These results indicate that after purification and reconstitution of the Torpedo nAChR, the difference in structure between the resting and desensitized states within the M2 ion channel domain was preserved, but not the agonist-dependent change of structure of the deltaM2-M3 loop. To further characterize the pharmacology of [(125)I]TID binding sites in the nAChR in the desensitized state, we examined the effect of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) on [(125)I]TID photolabeling. PCP inhibited [(125)I]TID labeling of amino acids at the cytoplasmic end of the ion channel (M2-2 and M2-6) while potentiating labeling at M2-9 and M2-13 and allosterically modulating the labeling of amino acids within the delta subunit helix bundle.",M3
19007510,"Validation of analysis of amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine in oral fluids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a method for the detection and quantitation of drugs of abuse in oral fluids. Fortified oral fluid samples (made in-house) and samples from donors collected with Quantasil oral fluid collection kits from Immunalysis were screened on an Olympus 5400 using reagents purchased from Immunalysis. Amphetamines (AMPs), opiates, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), and cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) in oral fluids were quantitated by an Applied Biosystems 3200 QTRAP liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS-MS). AMPs, opiates, PCP, cocaine, and BE were extracted from samples using liquid-liquid or solid-phase extractions and the extracts were separated on a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatograph prior to the MS-MS analysis. For each drug, two multiple reaction mode transitions were monitored using positive electrospray ionization coupled to an MS-MS detector. Corresponding d3, d5, d6, and d11 internal standards were used to quantitate the results. The limit of detection/quantitation for AMPs, opiates, PCP, cocaine, and its metabolite BE were 10, 10, 2, 2, and 2 ng/mL of oral fluid, respectively, on a signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 4. This corresponded to 25, 25, 5, 5, and 5 pg on column. The method was verified by participating in the North America Oral Fluid Proficiency Testing administered by Research Triangle Institute and by analyzing real samples from donors. In conclusion, LC-MS-MS provided a simple way to analyze and quantitate drugs of abuse in oral fluids.",M3
18940225,"Perinatal <e>PCP</e> treatment alters the developmental expression of prefrontal and hippocampal muscarinic receptors.Perinatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment has been used to model brain pathological processes that may be present in schizophrenia such as increased apoptosis during early brain development, and long-term alterations in expression of parvalbumin-containing interneurons and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. We report that this treatment also affects receptor expression of another excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, the muscarinic receptor. Female rat pups received injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline on postnatal days (PN)7, 9 and 11. [3H]Pirenzepine binding to M1/4 receptors was examined at four time-points (PN12, 18, 32 and 96) following treatment cessation. Significant effects of treatment on [3H]pirenzepine binding were evident immediately after treatment cessation with a decrease in PCP-treated rats at PN12 in the prefrontal cortex (-24%, p&lt;0.05) and hippocampus (-19%, p&lt;0.05). After this initial decrease, binding subsequently increased to 47% above control levels in the prefrontal cortex of adolescent animals, which remained elevated in adulthood (+10%, p&lt;0.05), while in the hippocampus there was a trend towards increased binding in adolescent animals and no change thereafter. This work adds to findings demonstrating that perinatal PCP exposure leads to long-term imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, supporting its relevance as a developmental model of schizophrenia pathology. Alterations in muscarinic receptor expression may contribute specifically to the cognitive impairments reported to occur after perinatal NMDA receptor antagonist treatment.",M3
18977208,"Clonidine and guanfacine attenuate phencyclidine-induced dopamine overflow in rat prefrontal cortex: mediating influence of the alpha-2A adrenoceptor subtype.N-methyl-D-aspartic acid/glutamate receptor antagonists induce psychotomimetic effects in humans and animals, and much research has focused on the neurochemical and network-level effects that mediate those behavioral changes. For example, a reduction in NMDA-dependent glutamatergic transmission triggers increased release of the monoamine transmitters, and some of these changes are implicated in the cognitive, behavioral and neuroanatomical effects of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists (e.g., clonidine) are effective at preventing many of the behavioral, neurochemical and anatomical effects of NMDA antagonists. Evidence has indicated that a key mechanism of the clonidine-induced reversal of the effects of NMDA antagonists is an attenuation of enhanced dopamine release. We have pursued these findings by investigating the effects of alpha-2 agonists on PCP-evoked dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats. Clonidine (0.003-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated the ability of PCP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to increase cortical dopamine output. The effects of clonidine were prevented by the alpha-2A subtype selective antagonist BRL-44408 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Guanfacine, which is an alpha-2 agonist with a higher affinity for the 2A, compared with 2B or 2C, subtypes, also blocked the ability of PCP to increase dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex. These data indicate that alpha-2A agonists are effective at counteracting the hyperdopaminergic state induced by PCP and may play a role in their neurobehavioral effects in this putative animal model for schizophrenia.",M3
18809428,"Increased impulsivity and disrupted attention induced by repeated phencyclidine are not attenuated by chronic quetiapine treatment.Atypical antipsychotic medications differ in how effectively they attenuate cognitive and other deficits in schizophrenia. The present study aimed to explore whether quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication, would reverse disruptions of performance in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), a test of attention and impulsivity, induced by repeated administration of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). In confirmation of previous findings, repeated PCP administration (2 mg/kg, s.c., 30 min before behavioral testing, for 2 consecutive days, followed by a 2-week PCP-free period and then 5 consecutive days of PCP treatment) increased premature responding (impulsivity), decreased accuracy (attention), and increased response latencies (processing speed) and timeout responding (impulsivity/cognitive inflexibility). Chronic quetiapine (5 or 10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) did not attenuate these PCP-induced disruptions in performance, while at the highest dose used, quetiapine disrupted 5-CSRTT performance in the absence of PCP treatment and tended to exacerbate the PCP-induced increase in premature responding. Considering that clozapine, another atypical antipsychotic, was shown previously to reverse PCP-induced deficits in the same task [Amitai N, Semenova S, Markou A. Cognitive-disruptive effects of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine and attenuation by atypical antipsychotic medications in rats. Psychopharmacology (Berl) 2007;193:521-37], the present findings demonstrate differences between clozapine and quetiapine in their effectiveness on schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits and impulsivity that may be attributable to their different receptor affinity profiles.",M3
18843483,"Cognitive effects of psychotomimetic drugs in rats discriminating number cues.RATIONALE: Deficits in memory and attention are broadly acknowledged during psychosis; however, experiments on modeled psychosis often test working memory without systematic manipulation of attentional demands. OBJECTIVES: The major research goal was discovering which neurobehavioral processes, attention, or memory contributed more to drug-provoked performance deficits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were trained to perform operant ratio discrimination (RD) tasks wherein the number of presses at a rear-wall lever was discriminated using one of two front-wall levers. Effects from four psychotomimetic drugs, the serotonin agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, the noncompetitive NMDA-glutamate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), and two CB1-selective cannabinoid agonists, WIN 55,512-2 and AM 411, were assessed using a signal detection analytical overlay to dissociate cognitive from noncognitive motor and motivational disruptions. Further methods allowed dissociation of attention compromises from mnemonic deficits. RESULTS: For each test compound, at least one dose elicited decreased RD accuracy without affecting response rates, and task difficulty was shown to be a crucial dictator of accuracy effect specificities. Effects from both PCP and WIN 55,512-2 biased animals to select the response lever conditioned for denser reinforcement. The same two drugs rendered peculiar response patterns in distracter light session components, considering light blinks were included to divert subjects' attention away from task-relevant information. The response patterns determined during distracter components of PCP/WIN testing sessions, counterintuitively, suggest performance enhancement. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive viewing of RD performance patterns after drug administration indicates that sustained attention and transient information management are significantly impaired during the drug-induced psychosis state, while selective attention is less affected.",M3
18751516,"A primate model of schizophrenia using chronic <e>PCP</e> treatment.To establish a primate animal model of schizophrenia with negative symptoms, the behavioral effects of chronic phencyclidine (PCP) and additional acute methamphetamine (MAP) administration were investigated in six monkeys. The results indicate that chronic PCP treatment induced a significant decrease in all categories of social behaviors, and that the chronic PCP monkeys also spent less time in proximity to other monkeys than the control monkeys. Acute MAP injection to the chronic PCP monkeys exacerbated the behavioral effects of PCP. The results suggest that these monkeys can be used as a primate model of schizophrenia with negative symptoms.",M3
18789179,"Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits modelling schizophrenia.Recent advances in the neurobiology of cannabinoids have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and schizophrenia. Our studies showed that chronic-intermittent phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment of rats, an animal model of schizophrenia-like cognitive deficit, impaired recognition memory in the novel object recognition (NOR) test and induced alterations in CB1 receptor functionality and in endocannabinoid levels mainly in the prefrontal cortex. In this region, we observed a significant reduction in GTPgammaS binding (-41%) accompanied by an increase in the levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG (+38%) in PCP-treated rats, suggesting that a maladaptation of the endocannabinoid system might contribute to the glutamatergic-related cognitive symptoms encountered in schizophrenia disorders. Moreover, we evaluated the ability of the main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), to modulate the cognitive dysfunctions and neuroadaptations in the endocannabinoid system induced by PCP. Chronic THC co-treatment worsened PCP-induced cognitive impairment, without inducing any effect per se, and in parallel, it provoked a severe reduction in the levels of the other endocannabinoid, AEA, vs. either vehicle (-73%) or PCP (-64%), whereas it reversed the PCP-induced increase in 2-AG levels. These results point to the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in this pharmacological model of cognitive dysfunction, with a potentially different role of AEA and 2-AG in schizophrenia-like behaviours and suggest that prolonged cannabis use might aggravate cognitive performances induced by chronic PCP by throwing off-balance the endocannabinoid system.",M3
18720671,"Neuropsychological effects of formaldehyde use.This study compared five individuals who intentionally ingested formaldehyde (possibly laced with <e>PCP</e>) in marijuana cigarettes to a control group on measures of cognitive ability. Formaldehyde, a major component in embalming fluid, is legal to purchase and possess and has become popular due to its euphoric properties. In significant doses, the chemical is a neurotoxin. The effects of inadvertent exposure are fairly well known, but the effects of intentional ingestion have only recently been investigated. In addition, there has been little research on the effects of formaldehyde use specific to intellectual ability and cognitive intactness. The results of this study indicate intentional ingestion may cause a decline in neuropsychological intactness, as measured by performance on the Shipley Institute of Living Scale.",M3
18720672,"Chloroquine psychosis masquerading as <e>PCP</e>: a case report.Chloroquine and its derivatives have been drugs of choice in the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria for over 50 years. These drugs are also frequently used in the treatment of various rheumatologic disorders. Because many Americans now travel abroad and may require chloroquine prophylaxis, as well as the fact that such medications are readily available through Internet-based supply houses, clinicians should be aware of the potential toxicity associated with the use of these agents. We present the case of an adolescent female who presented with acute, chloroquine-induced toxic psychosis resembling that induced by phencyclidine (PCP) in clinical presentation and laboratory findings. In the acute setting, the differentiation between chloroquine toxic psychosis and PCP psychosis may be difficult. Therefore, the syndrome of chloroquine-induced psychosis is reviewed and its differentiation from PCP psychosis highlighted as it relates to important aspects of this case.",M3
18684341,"Effects of repeated treatment of phencyclidine on cognition and gene expression in C57BL/6 mice.A number of studies indicate that glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission is disturbed in schizophrenia partly based on the findings that NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) can reproduce a schizophrenia-like syndrome in both humans and rodents. This study investigated whether repeated administration of low doses of PCP can induce cognitive dysfunctions in mice at doses which produce no sensorimotor disturbances. In addition, the effects on cognition were related to the expression of two genes, Arc and spinophilin, which have been related to neuronal plasticity and learning. Adult male C57Bl/6J mice received daily s.c. doses of PCP (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) or saline for 7 d. Testing was performed 24 h after the last day of treatment. Only the 2.0 mg/kg PCP dose produced a consistent impairment in spatial learning and working memory performed in the water-maze task without any apparent sensorimotor deficits. Importantly, the 2.0 mg/kg PCP dose produced no impairment in a non-spatial learning paradigm in the water-maze task. PCP treatment altered Arc mRNA levels in the hippocampus and retrosplenial agranular cortex while leaving the striatum and prefrontal cortex unaffected. The mRNA expression of spinophilin was down-regulated in striatum by repeated PCP treatment. These results demonstrate that repeated treatment with low doses of PCP in mice can produce specific cognitive deficits which are associated with alterations in gene expression in brain regions that appear to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These results suggest that the low-dose PCP model may have significant potential in characterizing the behavioural and molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia patients.",M3
18704372,"Pharmacological stimulation of NMDA receptors via co-agonist site suppresses fMRI response to phencyclidine in the rat.RATIONALE: Increasing experimental evidence suggests that impaired N-methyl-D: -aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (NMDAr) function could be a key pathophysiological determinant of schizophrenia. Agonists at the allosteric glycine (Gly) binding site of the NMDA complex can promote NMDAr activity, a strategy that could provide therapeutic efficacy for the disorder. NMDAr antagonists like phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) can induce psychotic and dissociative symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia and are therefore widely used experimentally to impair NMDA neurotransmission in vivo. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to investigate the modulatory effects of endogenous and exogenous agonists at the NMDAr Gly site on the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activation induced by acute PCP challenge in the rat. The drugs investigated were D: -serine, an endogenous agonist of the NMDAr Gly site, and SSR504734, a potent Gly transporter type 1 (GlyT-1) inhibitor that can potentiate NMDAr function by increasing synaptic levels of Gly. RESULTS: Acute administration of PCP induced robust and sustained activation of discrete cortico-limbo-thalamic circuits. Pretreatment with D: -serine (1 g/kg) or SSR504734 (10 mg/kg) completely inhibited PCP-induced functional activation. This effect was accompanied by weak but sustained deactivation particularly in cortical areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that agents that stimulate NMDAr via Gly co-agonist site can potentiate NMDAr activity in the living brain and corroborate the potential for this class of drugs to provide selective enhancement of NMDAr neurotransmission in schizophrenia.",M3
18675260,"In utero <e>PCP</e> exposure alters oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in developing rat frontal cortex.Several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, ADD/ADHD and dyslexia are believed to originate during gestation and involve white matter abnormalities. Modulation of glutamate environments and glutamate receptors has also been implicated in alteration of oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells of the CNS. To begin to understand how modulation of the glutamate system affects the maturation of oligodendrocytes, developing rats were subjected to prenatal blockade of the NMDA receptor with phencyclidine (PCP). Oligodendrocyte development and differentiation were then examined postnatally by measuring markers for early, middle and late stage cells. The results indicate that, while the level of marker proteins for neurons and astrocytes remains the same, early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell markers are decreased in rat brains prenatally exposed to PCP. Labeling of cells of intermediate, immature cell stages is elevated. Late stage markers for myelinating oligodendrocytes are subsequently decreased. These data suggest that prenatal NMDA receptor blockade reduces the level of progenitors and that the surviving cells are arrested at an immature stage. This premature arrest appears to result in fewer fully differentiated, mature oligodendrocytes that are capable of producing myelin. These results have interesting implications for the role of glutamate and glutamate receptors in white matter abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders.",M3
18679658,"Aripiprazole ameliorates phencyclidine-induced impairment of recognition memory through dopamine D1 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.RATIONALE: Cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, are regarded as a core feature of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has been shown to improve disruption of prepulse inhibition and social interaction in an animal model of schizophrenia induced by phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>); however, the effects of aripiprazole on recognition memory remain to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the effect of aripiprazole on cognitive impairment in mice treated with PCP repeatedly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were repeatedly administered PCP at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 14 days, and their cognitive function was assessed using a novel-object recognition task. We investigated the therapeutic effects of aripiprazole (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) on cognitive impairment in mice treated with PCP repeatedly. RESULTS: Single (1.0 mg/kg) and repeated (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, for 7 days) treatment with aripiprazole ameliorated PCP-induced impairment of recognition memory, although single treatment significantly decreased the total exploration time during the training session. In contrast, both single and repeated treatment with haloperidol (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) failed to attenuate PCP-induced cognitive impairment. The ameliorating effect of aripiprazole on recognition memory in PCP-treated mice was blocked by co-treatment with a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100635; however, co-treatment with a D2 receptor antagonist raclopride had no effect on the ameliorating effect of aripiprazole. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ameliorative effect of aripiprazole on PCP-induced memory impairment is associated with dopamine D1 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.",M3
18667523,"Neonatal <e>PCP</e> is more potent than ketamine at modifying preweaning behaviors of Sprague-Dawley rats.Treatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as ketamine (KET) or phencyclidine (PCP), can trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in neonatal rodents; however, little is known about the behavioral alterations resulting from such treatment. Here, rats were sc treated with saline; 10 mg/kg PCP on postnatal days (PNDs) 7, 9, and 11; 20 mg/kg KET (six injections every 2 h on PND 7); or a regimen of ketamine and 250 mg/kg L-carnitine (KLC) both administered on PND 7 with additional 250 mg/kg doses of L-carnitine given on PNDs 8-11. Postinjection, the home cage behavior of each pup was categorized on PNDs 7-11. Slant board and forelimb hang behaviors were examined on PNDs 8-11 and 12-16, respectively. The initial KET or KLC injections on PND 7 elevated abnormal home cage activity (i.e., paresis and paddling); however, KLC pup behavior returned to normal by the fourth injection, indicating the protective effects of L-carnitine against NMDA antagonist toxicity. PCP treatment caused substantial abnormal home cage activity on each injection day (PNDs 7, 9, and 11). Latencies to turn on the slant board were significantly longer on PND 8 for KET- and PCP-treated pups and PND 10 for PCP-treated pups. On PND 12, the forelimb hang time of PCP-treated pups was significantly shorter. Body weight was decreased on PNDs 8-18 in PCP-treated pups and PNDs 8-10 in KET-treated pups. These data indicate that developmental NMDA antagonist treatment causes short-term behavioral alterations which appear related to motor coordination and may be cerebellar in nature. Furthermore, single PCP injections appear more potent at altering behavior than multiple injections of KET.",M3
18674888,"Expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B NMDA receptor subunits is not altered in the genetically-inbred Balb/c mouse strain with heightened behavioral sensitivity to MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist.The genetically-inbred Balb/c mouse strain shows heightened sensitivity to the ability of MK-801 (dizocilpine), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, to raise the threshold voltage necessary to precipitate tonic hindlimb extension and elicit irregular episodes of intense jumping behavior (referred to as  popping ), relative to other inbred mouse strains and the outbred NIH Swiss mouse. Moreover, an allosteric modulatory effect of sarcosine, a glycine reuptake inhibitor, on MK-801's antagonism of electrically precipitated seizures was detected 24 h after Balb/c mice were forced to swim in cold water for up to 10 min; this was not observed in unstressed Balb/c mice or stressed or unstressed NIH Swiss mice. Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain as MK-801, precipitates a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals that shares descriptive similarities with schizophrenia. This observation has led to the hypothesis that NMDA receptor hypofunction (NRH) is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the testing of pharmacotherapeutic strategies to facilitate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in patients with this disorder (e.g., glycine reuptake inhibitors). The heightened behavioral sensitivity of the Balb/c mouse to MK-801 suggests that this mouse strain may be a useful model to study  psychosis-proneness  and screen for positive allosteric modulators of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Conceivably, strain differences in the pharmacology of the NMDA receptor are due to differences in the relative expression of individual NMDA receptor subunits to each other (i.e., combinatorial regulation). The current study compared the normal protein expression patterns of six of the eight identified splice variant isoforms of the NR1 NMDA receptor subunit, and NR2A and NR2B subunits in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Balb/c and NIH Swiss mice. The heightened behavioral sensitivity of the Balb/c genetically-inbred mouse strain to MK-801, compared to the outbred NIH Swiss mouse strain, does not appear to result from relative alterations of expression of these NMDA receptor protein subunits that were examined.",M3

It reversibly blocked glycine uptake in mouse brain cortical homogenates, increased extracellular levels of glycine in the rat prefrontal cortex, and potentiated NMDA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in rat hippocampal slices. SSR103800 (30 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased MK-801- and <e>PCP</e>-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rodents. SSR103800 (1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated social recognition deficit in adult rats induced by neonatal injections of PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c., on post-natal day 7, 9 and 11). SSR103800 (3 mg/kg, p.o.) counteracted the deficit in short-term visual episodic-like memory induced by a low challenge dose of PCP (1 mg/kg, i.p.), in PCP-sensitized rats (10 mg/kg, i.p.). SSR103800 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex in DBA/1J mice.

18640263,"Rapid cortico-limbic alterations in AMPA receptor densities after administration of <e>PCP</e>: implications for schizophrenia.Phencyclidine (PCP), a non-competitive NMDA/glutamate receptor antagonist, is a psychotomimetic drug that produces a syndrome in normal humans that resembles schizophrenia. The present study investigated the mechanisms of PCP actions by examining the density of glutamate and muscarinic receptors in the rat brain 4h after a single injection of PCP. We used receptor autoradiography and [3H]MK801, [3H]AMPA, [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]AFDX384 to target glutamate NMDA, glutamate AMPA and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, respectively. The major outcome from the present study was an overall decrease in levels of the glutamate AMPA receptor density (F=14.5, d.f.=1, p&lt;0.001) in the PCP treated rats. More specifically, PCP-treated animals displayed decreased AMPA receptor density in hippocampus CA1 (-16%), hippocampus CA2 (-25%), dentate gyrus (-27%), parietal cortex layers III-VI (-19%), central nucleus of the amygdala (-40%), and basolateral amygdala (-19%). Other brain regions examined were unaffected. PCP administration did not significantly affect glutamate NMDA, muscarinic M1 and M2 receptor density. The present study demonstrates the limbic system as the anatomical locus of alterations in AMPA receptor density after acute administration of PCP and may have implications for models of schizophrenia that focus on glutamatergic dysfunction in limbic cortical regions.",M3
18615569,"GLT-1 expression and Glu uptake in rat cerebral cortex are increased by phencyclidine.Using western blottings, microdialysis, and functional assays we tested the hypothesis that phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) modifies the expression and function of glutamate (Glu) transporters in the rat frontal cortex. Western blotting studies revealed that administration of PCP (10 mg/kg/day; 7 days) increased significantly the expression of the astrocytic Glu transporter GLT-1/EAAT2. Functional studies showed that PCP increased significantly Na+-dependent Glu uptake in slices and in neuron/astrocyte co-cultures, and microdialysis studies evidenced that PCP treatment reduced basal Glu output. In our experimental conditions, PCP did not induce toxicity. These studies show that PCP increases the expression of GLT-1 in the cerebral cortex, thereby increasing Glu uptake and reducing extracellular [Glu].",M3
18618099,"Chronic nicotine improves cognitive performance in a test of attention but does not attenuate cognitive disruption induced by repeated phencyclidine administration.RATIONALE: Nicotine-induced cognitive enhancement may be a factor maintaining tobacco smoking, particularly in psychiatric populations suffering from cognitive deficits. Schizophrenia patients exhibit higher smoking rates compared with the general population, suggesting that attempts to self-medicate cognitive schizophrenia deficits may underlie these high smoking levels. OBJECTIVES: The present study explored pro-cognitive effects of nicotine in a model of schizophrenia-like cognitive dysfunction to test this self-medication hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated whether chronic nicotine (3.16 mg/kg/day, base) would attenuate the performance disruption in the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT, a task assessing various cognitive modalities, including attention) induced by repeated administration of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that induces cognitive deficits relevant to schizophrenia. RESULTS: Chronic nicotine administration shortened 5-CSRTT response latencies under baseline conditions. Nicotine-treated rats also made more correct responses and fewer omissions than vehicle-treated rats. Replicating previous studies, repeated PCP administration (2 mg/kg, 30 min before behavioral testing for two consecutive days followed 2 weeks later by five consecutive days of PCP administration) decreased accuracy and increased response latencies, premature responding, and timeout responding. Chronic nicotine did not attenuate these PCP-induced disruptions. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic nicotine had pro-cognitive effects by itself, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive enhancement may contribute to tobacco smoking. At the doses of nicotine and PCP used, however, no support was found for the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of nicotine on cognitive deficits induced by repeated PCP administration, assessed in the 5-CSRTT, are larger than nicotine effects in the absence of PCP.",M3
18573247,"Agmatine attenuates the disruptive effects of phencyclidine on prepulse inhibition.Agmatine, a decarboxylation product of arginine, is thought to be an important neuromodulator in the mammalian brain. It is proposed to exert neuroprotective, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The receptor-binding profile of agmatine is complex and includes interaction with alpha(2)-adrenergic and imidazoline I(1) receptors. Furthermore, agmatine is an NMDA-receptor antagonist and inhibits nitric oxide synthase. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response is used as a measure of the pre-attentive information processing. PPI is lowered in schizophrenia and this impairment can be mimicked in experimental animals using the psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of agmatine per se on the PPI response and the effects of agmatine pre-treatment on a PCP-induced disruption of PPI. Agmatine administration (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) did not change the PPI response or the acoustic startle response. However, pre-treatment with agmatine 20 mg/kg, but not agmatine 40 mg/kg, significantly attenuated a PCP (5 mg/kg)-induced disruption of the PPI response. These results emphasize the potential role of agmatine as a neuromodulator and potential target for novel treatments for brain disorders.",M3
18582491,"Effects of altering reinforcer magnitude and reinforcement schedule on phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) self-administration in monkeys using an adjusting delay task.Compared to nondrug reinforcers, few studies have examined delay discounting for drug reinforcers. The purpose of the present study was to examine delay discounting in rhesus monkeys using orally delivered phencyclidine (PCP) as the reinforcer and to examine the effects of manipulating reinforcer magnitude and cost on delay discounting for PCP using an adjusting delay task. Monkeys could choose between a single delivery of PCP available immediately or a bundle of PCP deliveries available following a titrated delay. The average of the delays, or the mean adjusted delay (MAD), served as the quantitative measure of delay discounting. In Experiment 1, reinforcer magnitude was manipulated by varying the PCP concentration and the size of the delayed reinforcer (6 or 12 deliveries). The concentration-effect curve for PCP deliveries assumed an inverted U-shaped function, but varying PCP concentration had little effect on MAD values or the choice between immediate and delayed reinforcers. Increasing the size of the delayed reinforcer produced an upward and leftward shift in the concentration-effect curve. In Experiment 2, the cost of reinforcers was manipulated by increasing the fixed ratio (FR) requirement for each choice. Increasing the FR led to increased MAD values and decreased PCP self-administration.",M3
18544461,"Atypical anti-schizophrenic drugs prevent changes in cortical N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and behavior following sub-chronic phencyclidine administration in developing rat pups.We sought to determine the relationship between phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced alterations in behavior and NMDAR expression in the cortex by examining the effect of anti-schizophrenic drug treatment on both. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were pretreated with risperidone or olanzapine prior to treatment with PCP on postnatal day 7 (PN7) or sub-chronically on PN7, 9, and 11. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle was measured on PN24-26 and following a challenge dose of 4 mg/kg PCP, locomotor activity was measured on PN28-35. PCP treatment on PN7 did not cause a deficit in PPI, but did cause locomotor sensitization. This was prevented by both antipsychotics. PCP treatment on PN7 caused an up-regulation of NR1 and NR2B, which was not affected by either anti-schizophrenic drug. PCP treatment on PN7, 9, and 11 caused a deficit in PPI and a sensitized locomotor response to PCP challenge as well as an up-regulation of NR1 and NR2A, all of which were prevented by both atypical anti-schizophrenic drugs. These data support the hypothesis that sub-chronic, but not single injection PCP treatment in developing rats results in behavioral alterations that are sensitive to antipsychotic drugs and these behavioral changes observed could be related to up-regulation of cortical NR1/NR2A receptors.",M3
18544676,"Lithium protection of phencyclidine-induced neurotoxicity in developing brain: the role of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways.Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been shown to be neurotoxic to developing brains and to result in schizophrenia-like behaviors later in development. Prevention of both effects by antischizophrenic drugs suggests the validity of PCP neurodevelopmental toxicity as a heuristic model of schizophrenia. Lithium is used for the treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders and has recently been shown to have neuroprotective properties. The present study used organotypic corticostriatal slices taken from postnatal day 2 rat pups to investigate the protective effect of lithium and the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathways in PCP-induced cell death. Lithium pretreatment dose-dependently reduced PCP-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in layers II to IV of the cortex. PCP elicited time-dependent inhibition of the MEK/ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways, as indicated by dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. The proapoptotic factor glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta was also dephosphorylated at serine 9 and thus activated. Lithium prevented PCP-induced inhibition of the two pathways and activation of GSK-3beta. Furthermore, blocking either PI-3K/Akt or MEK/ERK pathway abolished the protective effect of lithium, whereas inhibiting GSK-3beta activity mimicked the protective effect of lithium. However, no cross-talk between the two pathways was found. Finally, specific GSK-3beta inhibition did not prevent PCP-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and ERK. These data strongly suggest that the protective effect of lithium against PCP-induced neuroapoptosis is mediated through independent stimulation of the PI-3K/Akt and ERK pathways and suppression of GSK-3beta activity.",M3
18480294,"Ketamine, but not phencyclidine, selectively modulates cerebellar GABA(A) receptors containing alpha6 and delta subunits.Phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) and ketamine are dissociative anesthetics capable of inducing analgesia, psychomimetic behavior, and a catatonic state of unconsciousness. Despite broad similarities, there are notable differences between the clinical actions of ketamine and PCP. Ketamine has a lower incidence of adverse effects and generally produces greater CNS depression than PCP. Both noncompetitively inhibit NMDA receptors, yet there is little evidence that these drugs affect GABA(A) receptors, the primary target of most anesthetics. alpha6beta2/3delta receptors are subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor family and are abundantly expressed in granular neurons within the adult cerebellum. Here, using an oocyte expression system, we show that at anesthetically relevant concentrations, ketamine, but not PCP, modulates alpha6beta2delta and alpha6beta3delta receptors. Additionally, at higher concentrations, ketamine directly activates these GABA(A) receptors. Comparatively, dizocilpine (MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate]), a potent noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors that is structurally unrelated to PCP, did not produce any effect on alpha6beta2delta receptors. Of the recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes examined (alpha1beta2, alpha1beta2gamma2, alpha1beta2delta, alpha4beta2gamma2, alpha4beta2delta, alpha6beta2gamma2, alpha6beta2delta, and alpha6beta3delta), the actions of ketamine were unique to alpha6beta2delta and alpha6beta3delta receptors. In dissociated granule neurons and cerebellar slice recordings, ketamine potentiated the GABAergic conductance arising from alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptors, whereas PCP showed no effect. Furthermore, ketamine potentiation was absent in cerebellar granule neurons from transgenic functionally null alpha6(-/-) and delta(-/-)mice. These findings suggest that the higher CNS depressant level achieved by ketamine may be the result of its selective actions on alpha6beta2/3delta receptors.",M3
18486387,"Drug-anaesthetic interaction in phMRI: the case of the psychotomimetic agent phencyclidine.Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) provides a powerful means to map the effects of drugs on brain activity, with important applications in pharmacological research. However, phMRI studies in preclinical species are often conducted under general anaesthesia as a means to avoid head motion and to minimise the stress induced by the procedure. Under these conditions, the phMRI response to the drug of interest may be affected by interactions with the anaesthetic agent, with consequences for the interpretation of the data. Here, we have investigated the phMRI response to phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), an NMDA receptor blocker, in the halothane-anaesthetised rat for varying levels of anaesthesia and different PCP challenge doses. PCP induces psychotic-like symptoms in humans and laboratory animals and is widely applied as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. However, PCP possesses anaesthetic properties per se, and its interactions with halothane might result in significant effects on the phMRI activation patterns. We observed two qualitatively different patterns of phMRI response. At 0.5 mg/kg iv PCP and 0.8% halothane maintenance anaesthesia, the lowest doses explored, an activation of discrete cortico-limbo-thalamic structures was observed, consistent with neuroimaging studies in humans and 2-deoxyglucose functional mapping in conscious animal models. However, higher anaesthetic concentrations or higher PCP challenge doses resulted in complete abolition of the positive response and in a widespread cortical deactivation (negative response). In the intermediate regime, we observed a dichotomic behaviour, with individual subjects showing one pattern or the other. These findings indicate a dose-dependent drug-anaesthetic interaction, with a complete reversal of the effects of PCP at higher challenge doses or HT concentrations.",M3
18446324,"Cataleptic effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and baclofen in mice: mediation by GABA(B) receptors, but differential enhancement by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists.RATIONALE: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog that is used to treat narcolepsy but that is also abused. GHB has many actions in common with the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen, but their underlying GABA(B) receptor mechanisms may be different. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to further investigate a possible differential role of glutamate in GABA(B) receptor-mediated effects of GHB and baclofen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiments examined the effects of non-competitive antagonists at the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors on GHB-induced catalepsy and compared these effects with those on baclofen-induced catalepsy. RESULTS: In C57BL/6J mice, ketamine, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), and dizocilpine (MK-801) all enhanced GHB-induced catalepsy. They did so with a potency order (i.e., MK-801 &gt; PCP &gt; ketamine) consistent with their relative potencies as NMDA antagonists but not as inhibitors of dopamine or organic cation transporters. Ketamine, PCP, and MK-801 enhanced catalepsy along inverted U-shaped dose-response curves likely because higher doses affected motor coordination, which limited their catalepsy-enhancing effects. Doses that were maximally effective to enhance GHB-induced catalepsy did not affect the cataleptic effects of baclofen. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that NMDA receptor antagonists enhance the cataleptic effects of GHB but not those of baclofen is further evidence that the GABA(B) receptor mechanisms mediating the effects of GHB and GABA(B) agonists are not identical. Differential interactions of glutamate with the GABA(B) receptor mechanisms mediating the effects of GHB and baclofen may explain why GHB is effective for treating narcolepsy and is abused, whereas baclofen is not.",M3
18453008,"Improvement of phencyclidine-induced social behaviour deficits in rats: involvement of 5-HT1A receptors.We have recently shown that sub-chronic phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment produces social behaviour deficits in female rats which are reversed by ziprasidone but not haloperidol or clozapine. This investigation was designed to extend the previous findings and identify the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in mediating the effects of these drugs in this model. Female hooded-Lister rats received vehicle (n=36; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) or PCP (n=22; 2mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout period. On test days, PCP-treated rats were treated acutely with aripiprazole (5mg/kg, s.c.) or WAY100635 (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In a second experiment, PCP-treated rats were treated acutely with either fluoxetine (2.5mg/kg, i.p.) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5mg/kg, i.p.) all 30 min prior to testing. For the test, pairs of unfamiliar rats receiving acute doses of drugs described above were placed in the test arena and social behaviours (following, sniffing, climbing over and under, exploration of inanimate object and avoiding) were recorded on video for subsequent blind scoring. The results showed that PCP-induced deficits in social behaviours were reversed by acute treatment with both aripiprazole and fluoxetine but not CDP or WAY100635. Furthermore, pre-treatment with WAY100635 prevented the reversal of social behaviour deficits observed with aripiprazole. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of drugs such as aripiprazole and fluoxetine on PCP-induced social behaviour deficits, a potential model of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, may be a consequence of modifications of the serotonergic system, in particular through an interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors.",M3
18406625,"Reduced activation of intracellular signaling pathways in rat prefrontal cortex after chronic phencyclidine administration.Evidence exists that schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in cell-cell communication and information processing. In the present study, we used the phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) animal model of schizophrenia to investigate possible defects in intracellular signaling proteins involved in neuroplasticity. Western Blot analysis has been performed to determine total and phospho-protein levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (alphaCaMKII) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) of rat chronically treated with PCP, whereas their mRNA levels were determined by real time RT-PCR. We found reduced levels of P-ERK1/2, P-alphaCaMKII and P-CREB in prefrontal cortex of PCP-treated animals when compared to controls, whereas no effects were observed on total protein or mRNA levels. Conversely, no significant changes were detected on protein levels or mRNA expression in hippocampus. Given the role of ERK1/2, alphaCaMKII and CREB in neuroplastic mechanisms and cell communication, our data suggest that their decreased activation following chronic PCP administration can contribute to cortical defects occurring in schizophrenia, and may therefore represent potential targets for pharmacological intervention.",M3
18427784,"Subchronic and chronic <e>PCP</e> treatment produces temporally distinct deficits in attentional set shifting and prepulse inhibition in rats.RATIONALE: We have previously demonstrated that subchronic (five daily administrations of 2.6 mg/kg PCP) and chronic intermittent administration of 2.6 mg/kg PCP to rats produces hypofrontality and other neurochemical changes akin to schizophrenia pathology (Cochran et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 28:265-275, 2003). OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether behavioral alterations related to discrete aspects of schizophrenia are also induced by these PCP treatment regimes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following administration of vehicle or PCP according to the protocols described above, rats were assessed for attentional set shifting ability, prepulse inhibition (PPI), or social interaction and the locomotor response to a challenge dose of amphetamine. RESULTS: Ability to shift attentional set was impaired 72 h after the last PCP administration following the subchronic and chronic intermittent treatment regimes. PPI was disrupted after each acute administration of PCP in animals under the subchronic treatment regime. However, PPI deficits were not sustained 72 h after the last of five daily administrations. In subchronic and chronic PCP treated animals, no change was found in social interaction behavior, and there was little change in baseline or amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity, employed as an indicator of dopaminergic hyperfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The temporally distinct behavioral effects of these PCP treatment regimes suggest that PPI deficits relate directly to acute NMDA receptor antagonism, whereas the more enduring set shifting deficits relate to the longer term consequences of NMDA receptor blockade. Therefore, these subchronic and chronic PCP treatment regimes produce hypofrontality (Cochran et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 28:265-275, 2003) and associated prefrontal cortex-dependent deficits in behavioral flexibility which mirror core deficits in schizophrenia.",M3
18367258,"Evaluation of a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia--early postnatal <e>PCP</e> treatment in attentional set-shifting.Phencyclidine (PCP) was administered to male and female Lister hooded rats on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9 and 11. All PCP animals tested in adulthood (PND 53-93) showed deficits in cognitive flexibility, specifically in their ability to shift attentional set, compared to controls. This novel finding is reminiscent of the impairment observed in schizophrenia patients, and supports the validity of the early postnatal PCP regimen as a disease-like model.",M3
18392753,"Comparison of haloperidol, risperidone, sertindole, and modafinil to reverse an attentional set-shifting impairment following subchronic <e>PCP</e> administration in the rat--a back translational study.RATIONALE: Selective cognitive impairments, including those of executive function as assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sort Test or intradimensional-extradimensional (ID-ED) tests, are a key feature of schizophrenia but remain inadequately treated by existing therapies. Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the recently described analogous rat ID-ED attentional set-shifting task by investigating the effects of various pharmacological challenges to a phencyclidine (PCP)-induced ED shift impairment, namely, haloperidol, risperidone, sertindole, and modafinil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to a subchronic systemic administration of either saline vehicle or PCP (5 mg/kg i.p. b.i.d. for 7 days) followed by a 7-day washout period. During this period, rats were trained to dig in baited bowls for a food reward and to discriminate based on odor or digging media. In a single test session conducted the day after the washout period (day 8), rats performed a series of discriminations following acute administration of either vehicle, or haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), or risperidone (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), or sertindole (1.25 mg/kg p.o.) or modafinil (64 mg/kg p.o.). RESULTS: The subchronic PCP-induced ED deficit was ameliorated by sertindole and modafinil but not by haloperidol or risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings further support that the rat ID-ED test in subchronic PCP-treated rats has utility and validity as a preclinical model of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and demonstrates back-translational potential.",M3
18321564,"Nitric oxide synthase inhibition attenuates phencyclidine-induced disruption of cognitive flexibility.Schizophrenia encompasses, amongst other symptoms, a heavy load of cognitive dysfunctionality. Using the psychotomimetic agent, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), we have previously found that PCP-induced disruptions of cognitive function in translational rodent models of schizophrenia are dependent on nitric oxide (NO) production. In the present study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a Morris water maze task designed to assess cognitive flexibility (i.e. the ability to cope with an increasingly demanding cognitive task) by means of a  constant reversal learning paradigm . Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10 mg/kg), on PCP-induced (2 mg/kg) impairments. Control animals significantly improved their learning over the first 3 consecutive days, whereas PCP-treated animals failed to show any significant learning. Pretreatment with L-NAME normalized the PCP-induced disruption of learning to control levels. These findings suggest that PCP-induced disruptions of cognitive flexibility (i.e. ability to modify behaviour according to an increasingly demanding cognitive task) are dependent upon NO production. These observations, together with accumulated clinical findings, suggest that the NO system is a potential treatment target for cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia.",M3
18311160,"Modelling prefrontal cortex deficits in schizophrenia: implications for treatment.Current treatments of schizophrenia are compromised by their inability to treat all symptoms of the disease and their side-effects. Whilst existing antipsychotic drugs are effective against positive symptoms, they have negligible efficacy against the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-associated cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. New models that reproduce core pathophysiological features of schizophrenia are more likely to have improved predictive validity in identifying new treatments. We have developed a NMDA receptor antagonist model that reproduces core PFC deficits of schizophrenia and discuss this in relation to pathophysiology and treatments. Subchronic and chronic intermittent <e>PCP</e> (2.6 mg/kg i.p.) was administered to rats. PFC activity was assessed by 2-deoxyglucose imaging, parvalbumin and Kv3.1 mRNA expression, and the attentional set-shifting test (ASST) of executive function. Affymetrix gene array technology was employed to examine gene expression profile patterns. PCP treatment reduced glucose utilization in the PFC (hypofrontality). This was accompanied by a reduction in markers of GABAergic interneurones (parvalbumin and Kv3.1 mRNA expression) and deficits in the extradimensional shift dimension of the ASST. Consistent with their clinical profile, the hypofrontality was not reversed by clozapine or haloperidol. Transcriptional analysis revealed patterns of change consistent with current neurobiological theories of schizophrenia. This model mirrors core neurobiological deficits of schizophrenia; hypofrontality, altered markers of GABAergic interneurone activity and deficits in executive function. As such it is likely to be a valuable translational model for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying hypofrontality and for identifying and validating novel drug targets that may restore PFC deficits in schizophrenia.",M3
18294895,"Phencyclidine and cannabinoids in vitreous humor.Vitreous humor (VH) is routinely collected at autopsy for the testing of electrolytes and ethanol. In recent years drugs of abuse have been detected in this specimen. In this study the authors assayed 30 VH samples for phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) and 50 specimens for cannabinoids. Specimens were screened by immunoassay and then assayed for PCP by GC-FID and cannabinoids by GC/MS. Eighteen (60%) specimens screened positive for PCP using a cutoff of 25 ng/mL. Quantitative analysis showed PCP concentrations in VH that screened positive ranged 30-290 ng/mL. Corresponding blood concentrations were 50-600 ng/mL. VH PCP concentrations in the 12 cases which screened negative were 40-470 ng/mL. False negative results were probably due to matrix effects. All VH specimens screened for cannabinoids were negative. Ten negative screening specimens assayed by GC/MS yielded 1 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol positive result at 2 ng/mL. These data indicated that VH maybe a useful specimen for the detection of PCP but not for cannabinoids.",M3
18282619,"A preliminary investigation into the effects of antipsychotics on sub-chronic phencyclidine-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting in female rats.RATIONALE: The NMDA receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), has been shown to induce symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. A loss in executive function and the ability to shift attention between stimulus dimensions is impaired in schizophrenia; this can be assessed in rodents by the perceptual attentional set-shifting task. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the deficits induced by sub-chronic PCP in attentional set-shifting could be reversed by sub-chronic administration of clozapine, risperidone or haloperidol. METHODS: Adult female hooded-Lister rats received sub-chronic PCP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg) i.p. twice daily for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout period. PCP-treated rats then received clozapine, risperidone, haloperidol or vehicle once daily for 7 days and were then tested in the perceptual set-shifting task. RESULTS: PCP significantly (p&lt;0.01) increased the number of trials to reach criterion in the EDS phase when compared to vehicle and this deficit was significantly (p&lt;0.01) attenuated by sub-chronic clozapine (2.5 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.2 mg/kg), but not by sub-chronic haloperidol treatment (0.05 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that sub-chronic PCP produced a robust deficit within the EDS phase in the attentional set-shifting task, in female rats. Atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and risperidone, but not the classical agent, haloperidol, significantly improved the PCP-induced cognitive deficit.",M3
18256931,"Altered dopamine receptor and dopamine transporter binding and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression following perinatal NMDA receptor blockade.This study examined how perinatal phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>) treatment would affect dopamine D2 receptor and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding at different stages after treatment cessation. Female rat pups received injections of PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline on postnatal day (PN)7, 9 and 11. D2 receptor and transporter binding was examined at four time-points (PN12, 18, 32 and 96) following injections. PCP treatment altered D2 receptor binding throughout development, with a final end-point of 22-33% decreased binding at adulthood in the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen (P &lt; 0.01), accompanied by a small but significant increase in DAT binding in the caudate putamen. Tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression was also significantly increased by 25% (P &lt; 0.05) in the ventral tegmental area of adult rats, suggesting that this model may produce a long-term increase in dopamine output. This study demonstrates that early insult to the brain from NMDA receptor hypofunction alters the dopaminergic system at different stages of development.",M3
18251012,"T-817MA, a novel neurotrophic compound, ameliorates phencyclidine-induced disruption of sensorimotor gating.RATIONALE: Neurodegenerative changes have been suggested to provide a basis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. T-817MA (1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl) ethoxy] propyl} azetidin-3-ol maleate) is a novel compound with neuroprotective and neurite-outgrowth effects, as elicited in rat primary cultured neurons. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of T-817MA on phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>)-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating, in male Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In chronic experiments, male Wistar rats were injected intermittently with PCP (2.0 mg/kg, i.p., three times per week) or vehicle (saline, 2.0 ml/kg) for 1 month. T-817MA (0.21 or 0.07 mg/ml, p.o.) or distilled water was administered throughout the study period. In an acute experiment, T-817MA (8.4 mg/kg, p.o.) or distilled water was administered, followed by treatment with PCP (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (saline, 2.0 ml/kg), before PPI measurements. RESULTS: Intermittent administration of PCP for 1 month induced persistent disruption of PPI. Coadministration of T-817MA at 0.21 mg/ml but not 0.07 mg/ml completely blocked PCP-induced disruption of PPI, whereas T-817MA (0.21 mg/ml) by itself did not show a significant effect on PPI in control rats. On the other hand, single administration of T-817MA did not affect PPI disruption by acute treatment with PCP. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that T-817MA is effective in ameliorating sensorimotor gating deficits caused by chronic PCP treatment, possibly via neuroprotective actions. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic approach for patients with schizophrenia.",M3
18242064,"Repeated low dose of phencyclidine administration impairs spatial learning in mice: blockade by clozapine but not by haloperidol.The effect of phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>), a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was examined in the water maze, a spatial learning and memory task dependent on hippocampal functions. Male adult C57Bl/6J mice received daily (s.c.) injections of either saline or PCP (0.25-4.0 mg/kg) for 12 days. During the last 5 days, the injections were followed by water maze training. Repeated PCP treatments disrupted spatial learning and memory in the 0.5-4.0 mg/kg dose range. Severe sensorimotor disturbances, observed at the 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg doses of PCP, precluded further swim maze testing. The 0.5 mg/kg but not the 1.0 mg/kg dose of PCP impaired spatial learning and memory without any apparent sensorimotor deficits. PCP, at 1.0 mg/kg, produced impairment in non-spatial learning in the swim maze task and motor disturbances in the rotarod test. Repeated daily treatment with either the  atypical  antipsychotic drug clozapine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or the  typical  antipsychotic drug haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg i.p.) failed to influence spatial performances. The spatial impairment caused by the 0.5 mg/kg dose of PCP was blocked by concomitant treatment with clozapine (0.5 mg/kg), but not with haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg). The results suggest that it is possible, at low doses of PCP, to dissociate the spatial learning impairment in the water maze from the adverse behavioral effects of NMDA receptor blockade. This model may provide a basis for the analysis of the mechanisms underlying declarative memory disturbances in schizophrenia and the differences in mechanisms between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.",M3
18227836,"Oxytocin as a natural antipsychotic: a study using oxytocin knockout mice.It has been previously suggested that oxytocin (Oxt) may act as a natural antipsychotic. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether disruption of the oxytocin gene (Oxt-/-) made mice more susceptible to the psychosis-related effects of amphetamine (Amp), apomorphine (Apo) and phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>). We examined drug-induced changes in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, a measure of sensorimotor gating deficits characteristic of several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia. We found that treatment with Amp, Apo and PCP all had effects on PPI. However, in Oxt-/- mice, but not Oxt+/+ mice, PCP treatment resulted in large PPI deficits. As PCP is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, these findings suggest that the absence of Oxt alters the glutamatergic component of the PPI.",M3
18208936,"Oestradiol attenuates the cognitive deficit induced by acute phencyclidine treatment in mature female hooded-Lister rats.Gender differences in psychiatric research are becoming more widely recognized, and changes in levels of the steroid hormone, oestrogen, over the menstrual or oestrous cycle are becoming increasingly implicated in alterations in cognitive strategies and capacities. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between oestrogen, NMDA receptor function and cognitive processing in rats. Forty-five mature female hooded-Lister rats received vehicle, 0.5, 5 or 10 microg/kg of oestradiol benzoate (EB, s.c. in olive oil) 24 h prior to an acute dose of 2 mg/kg phencyclidine (<e>PCP</e>, i.p. in 0.9% w/v saline), or vehicle (0.9% saline). After 30 min following PCP treatment, animals completed the novel object recognition task with a 1 min inter-trial interval to assess object recognition memory. Results show that 5 and 10 microg/kg of EB 24 h prior to 2 mg/kg PCP significantly (P &lt; 0.01 and &lt; 0.001, respectively) protected against the cognitive impairing effect of PCP in contrast to vehicle and 0.5 microg/kg EB plus PCP (not significant). EB may exert a neuromodulatory effect in this animal model leading to attenuation of the PCP-induced impairment in object recognition memory, suggesting an interaction between the gonadal steroids and NMDA receptor-mediated cognitive dysfunction, which is of potential relevance to schizophrenia.",M3
