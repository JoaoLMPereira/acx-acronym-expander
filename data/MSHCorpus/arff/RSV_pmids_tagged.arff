20435918,"Directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport of the retroviral gag protein depends on sequential binding of karyopherins and viral RNA.Retroviral Gag polyproteins coopt host factors to traffic from cytosolic ribosomes to the plasma membrane, where virions are released. Before membrane transport, the multidomain Gag protein of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) undergoes importin-mediated nuclear import and CRM1-dependent nuclear export, an intrinsic step in the assembly pathway. Transient nuclear trafficking of Gag is required for efficient viral RNA (vRNA) encapsidation, suggesting that Gag:vRNA binding might occur in the nucleus. Here, we show that Gag is imported into the nucleus through direct interactions of the Gag NC domain with importin-alpha (imp-alpha) and the MA domain with importin-11 (imp-11). The vRNA packaging signal, known as psi, inhibited imp-alpha binding to Gag, indicating that the NC domain does not bind to imp-alpha and vRNA simultaneously. Unexpectedly, vRNA binding also prevented the association of imp-11 with both the MA domain alone and with Gag, suggesting that the MA domain may bind to the vRNA genome. In contrast, direct binding of Gag to the nuclear export factor CRM1, via the CRM1-RanGTP heterodimer, was stimulated by psiRNA. These findings suggest a model whereby the genomic vRNA serves as a switch to regulate the ordered association of host import/export factors that mediate Gag nucleocytoplasmic trafficking for virion assembly. The Gag:vRNA interaction appears to serve multiple critical roles in assembly: specific selection of the vRNA genome for packaging, stimulating the formation of Gag dimers, and triggering export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from the nucleus.",M1
20392845,"An LYPSL late domain in the gag protein contributes to the efficient release and replication of Rous sarcoma virus.The efficient release of newly assembled retrovirus particles from the plasma membrane requires the recruitment of a network of cellular proteins (ESCRT machinery) normally involved in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies and in cytokinesis. Retroviruses and other enveloped viruses recruit the ESCRT machinery through three classes of short amino acid consensus sequences termed late domains: PT/SAP, PPXY, and LYPX(n)L. The major late domain of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) has been mapped to a PPPY motif in Gag that binds members of the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases. RSV Gag also contains a second putative late domain motif, LYPSL, positioned 5 amino acids downstream of PPPY. LYPX(n)L motifs have been shown to support budding in other retroviruses by binding the ESCRT adaptor protein Alix. To investigate a possible role of the LYPSL motif in RSV budding, we constructed PPPY and LYPSL mutants in the context of an infectious virus and then analyzed the budding rates, spreading profiles, and budding morphology. The data imply that the LYPSL motif acts as a secondary late domain and that its role in budding is amplified in the absence of a fully functional PPPY motif. The LYPXL motif proved to be a stronger late domain when an aspartic acid was substituted for the native serine, recapitulating the properties of the LYPDL late domain of equine infectious anemia virus. The overexpression of human Alix in the absence of a fully functional PPPY late domain partially rescued both the viral budding rate and viral replication, supporting a model in which the RSV LYPSL motif mediates budding through an interaction with the ESCRT adaptor protein Alix.",M1
20387899,"NMR relaxation studies of an RNA-binding segment of the rous sarcoma virus gag polyprotein in free and bound states: a model for autoinhibition of assembly.Assembly of retrovirus particles is promoted by interaction of the Gag polyprotein with RNA. Nonspecific RNA association with the nucleocapsid domain (NC) of Gag induces the dimerization of Gag through protein-protein contacts in the capsid domain (CA), followed by higher order assembly to form the immature virus particle. NMR relaxation studies were conducted to investigate the initial steps of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) assembly by examining the association with nucleic acid of a fragment of Gag comprising the C-terminal domain of CA (CTD) postulated to mediate Gag dimerization, the spacer region between CA and NC (SP), and NC. This fragment, CTD-SP-NC (residues 394-577), spans the critical SP region and allows assessment of this key Gag-nucleic acid interaction in the context of the Gag polyprotein rather than the isolated domains. Main-chain amide relaxation of CTD-SP-NC was measured in the absence and presence of (GT)(4), an 8-mer DNA oligonucleotide that binds tightly to the polyprotein but is too short to promote Gag dimerization. The results show that the CTD and NC domains tumble independently. In contrast, the two zinc finger domains within NC are rotationally coupled in both the unbound and bound states, even though only the first zinc finger appears to make direct contact with (GT)(4). In addition, the NMR data indicate that SP and flanking residues undergo a conformational exchange process that is slowed in the presence of (GT)(4). This region around SP where relaxation is strongly affected by (GT)(4) binding is nearly identical to the assembly domain defined previously by mutagenesis studies. Other changes in relaxation induced by (GT)(4) implicate conformational perturbations of helices 1 and 4 in CTD. On the basis of the combined data, we propose a model for the promotion of Gag dimerization by RNA association in which NC-RNA binding disrupts an assembly inhibitory, intramolecular interaction involving SP and CTD. Disruption of this intramolecular interaction is proposed to enhance the accessibility of the Gag dimer contact surface and release the assembly domain to promote intermolecular oligomerization.",M1
20308396,"Genotypes of chicken major histocompatibility complex B locus associated with regression of Rous sarcoma virus J-strain tumors.The chicken MHC-B locus affects the response to several strains of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>). We evaluated the association between haplotypes of the MHC-B locus and responses to the J strain of RSV by using an F(2) experimental resource family constructed with tumor-regressive (White Leghorn) and tumor-progressive (Rhode Island Red) chickens. The MHC-B haplotypes were determined by genotyping of the microsatellite marker LEI0258 and MHC-B locus class I alpha chain 2 (BF2). Two haplotypes in the resource family, one associated with tumor regression and one with progression, were defined by these 2 markers. To discriminate more precisely the regressive haplotype in this family, we further developed 35 SNP markers at the MHC-B locus. Information on the haplotypes revealed here should be useful for identifying chickens with regression and progression phenotypes of J-strain RSV-induced tumors.",M1
20228062,"Proton-driven assembly of the Rous Sarcoma virus capsid protein results in the formation of icosahedral particles.In a mature and infectious retroviral particle, the capsid protein (CA) forms a shell surrounding the genomic RNA and the replicative machinery of the virus. The irregular nature of this capsid shell precludes direct atomic resolution structural analysis. CA hexamers and pentamers are the fundamental building blocks of the capsid, however the pentameric state, in particular, remains poorly characterized. We have developed an efficient in vitro protocol for studying the assembly of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) CA that involves mild acidification and produces structures modeling the authentic viral capsid. These structures include regular spherical particles with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, built from CA pentamers alone. These particles were subject to cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image processing, and a pseudo-atomic model of the icosahedron was created by docking atomic structures of the constituent CA domains into the cryo-EM-derived three-dimensional density map. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of CA forms pentameric turrets, which decorate the surface of the icosahedron, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CA is positioned underneath, linking the pentamers. Biophysical analysis of the icosahedral particle preparation reveals that CA monomers and icosahedra are the only detectable species and that these exist in reversible equilibrium at pH 5. These same acidic conditions are known to promote formation of a RSV CA CTD dimer, present within the icosahedral particle, which facilitates capsid assembly. The results are consistent with a model in which RSV CA assembly is a nucleation-limited process driven by very weak protein-protein interactions.",M1
19446529,"Proton-linked dimerization of a retroviral capsid protein initiates capsid assembly.In mature retroviral particles, the capsid protein (CA) forms a shell encasing the viral replication complex. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) CA dimerizes in solution, through its C-terminal domain (CTD), and this interaction is important for capsid assembly. In contrast, other retroviral capsid proteins, including that of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>), do not dimerize with measurable affinity. Here we show, using X-ray crystallography and other biophysical methods, that acidification causes RSV CA to dimerize in a fashion analogous to HIV CA, and that this drives capsid assembly in vitro. A pair of aspartic acid residues, located within the CTD dimer interface, explains why dimerization is linked to proton binding. Our results show that despite overarching structural similarities, the intermolecular forces responsible for forming and stabilizing the retroviral capsid differ markedly across retroviral genera. Our data further suggest that proton binding may regulate RSV capsid assembly, or modulate stability of the assembled capsid.",M1
19369339,"Genetic evidence for a connection between Rous sarcoma virus gag nuclear trafficking and genomic RNA packaging.The packaging of retroviral genomic RNA (gRNA) requires cis-acting elements within the RNA and trans-acting elements within the Gag polyprotein. The packaging signal psi, at the 5' end of the viral gRNA, binds to Gag through interactions with basic residues and Cys-His box RNA-binding motifs in the nucleocapsid. Although specific interactions between Gag and gRNA have been demonstrated previously, where and when they occur is not well understood. We discovered that the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) Gag protein transiently localizes to the nucleus, although the roles of Gag nuclear trafficking in virus replication have not been fully elucidated. A mutant of RSV (Myr1E) with enhanced plasma membrane targeting of Gag fails to undergo nuclear trafficking and also incorporates reduced levels of gRNA into virus particles compared to those in wild-type particles. Based on these results, we hypothesized that Gag nuclear entry might facilitate gRNA packaging. To test this idea by using a gain-of-function genetic approach, a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) derived from the nucleoplasmin protein was inserted into the Myr1E Gag sequence (generating mutant Myr1E.NLS) in an attempt to restore nuclear trafficking. Here, we report that the inserted NLS enhanced the nuclear localization of Myr1E.NLS Gag compared to that of Myr1E Gag. Also, the NLS sequence restored gRNA packaging to nearly wild-type levels in viruses containing Myr1E.NLS Gag, providing genetic evidence linking nuclear trafficking of the retroviral Gag protein with gRNA incorporation.",M1
19368128,"Adenovirus-mediated thymidine kinase gene therapy induces apoptosis in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells and damages PARP-1.Adenoviral (ADV) gene therapy with the thymidine kinase gene (TK) under control of the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) promotor followed by the administration of acyclovir leads to replication errors in transcription and to cell death. This concept of ADV-RSV-TK has been established for the treatment of ovarian cancer cells. The purpose of this investigation was to clarify whether cell death after ADV-RSV-TK gene therapy and acyclovir administration is indeed due to apoptosis induction, whether the synergistic effect of ADV-RSV-TK gene therapy with chemotherapy was limited to the primary mechanism of action or whether the vector transduction itself exerted any pro-apoptotic effect was examined using the epithelial cell lines OVCAR-3 and MDAH-2774, established from human poorly differentiated serous ovarian cancer. Fluorimetric assay of caspase-3 activity was performed, as well as ELISA of the CK 18 split product M30. PARP cleavage was analysed by Western blotting. Apoptosis induction was established in this investigation as the mechanism of the ADV-RSV-TK gene therapy effect of acyclovir administration by caspase activity and subsequent CK 18 cleavage. Neither acyclovir nor vector administration alone showed any apoptotic activity. The synergistic effect of TK gene therapy and chemotherapeutic agents was shown to be TK induced. Significant anti-PARP 1 activity was found to be an ADV-RSV-TK treatment effect after acyclovir addition.",M1
19361521,"Retroviral capsid assembly: a role for the CA dimer in initiation.In maturing retroviral virions, CA protein assembles to form a capsid shell that is essential for infectivity. The structure of the two folded domains [N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD)] of CA is highly conserved among various retroviruses, and the capsid assembly pathway, although poorly understood, is thought to be conserved as well. In vitro assembly reactions with purified CA proteins of the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) were used to define factors that influence the kinetics of capsid assembly and provide insights into underlying mechanisms. CA multimerization was triggered by multivalent anions providing evidence that in vitro assembly is an electrostatically controlled process. In the case of RSV, in vitro assembly was a well-behaved nucleation-driven process that led to the formation of structures with morphologies similar to those found in virions. Isolated RSV dimers, when mixed with monomeric protein, acted as efficient seeds for assembly, eliminating the lag phase characteristic of a monomer-only reaction. This demonstrates for the first time the purification of an intermediate on the assembly pathway. Differences in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of monomeric protein and the assembly-competent dimer fraction suggest the involvement of the NTD in the formation of the functional dimer. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of well-characterized CTD mutants provides evidence for assembly dependence on the second domain and suggests that the establishment of an NTD-CTD interface is a critical step in capsid assembly initiation. Overall, the data provide clear support for a model whereby capsid assembly within the maturing virion is dependent on the formation of a specific nucleating complex that involves a CA dimer and is directed by additional virion constituents.",M1
19224995,"Foreign glycoproteins can be actively recruited to virus assembly sites during pseudotyping.Retroviruses like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), as well as many other enveloped viruses, can efficiently produce infectious virus in the absence of their own surface glycoprotein if a suitable glycoprotein from a foreign virus is expressed in the same cell. This process of complementation, known as pseudotyping, often can occur even when the glycoprotein is from an unrelated virus. Although pseudotyping is widely used for engineering chimeric viruses, it has remained unknown whether a virus can actively recruit foreign glycoproteins to budding sites or, alternatively, if a virus obtains the glycoproteins through a passive mechanism. We have studied the specificity of glycoprotein recruitment by immunogold labeling viral glycoproteins and imaging their distribution on the host plasma membrane using scanning electron microscopy. Expressed alone, all tested viral glycoproteins were relatively randomly distributed on the plasma membrane. However, in the presence of budding HIV-1 or Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) particles, some glycoproteins, such as those encoded by murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, were dramatically redistributed to viral budding sites. In contrast, the RSV Env glycoprotein was robustly recruited only to the homologous RSV budding sites. These data demonstrate that viral glycoproteins are not in preformed membrane patches prior to viral assembly but rather that glycoproteins are actively recruited to certain viral assembly sites.",M1
19091866,"Structural characterization of the Rous sarcoma virus RNA stability element.In eukaryotic cells, an mRNA bearing a premature termination codon (PTC) or an abnormally long 3' untranslated region (UTR) is often degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Despite the presence of a 5- to 7-kb 3' UTR, unspliced retroviral RNA escapes this degradation. We previously identified the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) stability element (RSE), an RNA element downstream of the gag natural translation termination codon that prevents degradation of the unspliced viral RNA. Insertion of this element downstream of a PTC in the RSV gag gene also inhibits NMD. Using partial RNase digestion and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry, we determined the secondary structure of this element. Incorporating RNase and SHAPE data into structural prediction programs definitively shows that the RSE contains an AU-rich stretch of about 30 single-stranded nucleotides near the 5' end and two substantial stem-loop structures. The overall secondary structure of the RSE appears to be conserved among 20 different avian retroviruses. The structural aspects of this element will serve as a tool in the future design of cis mutants in addressing the mechanism of stabilization.",M1
19035280,"Persistent adenovirus-mediated thymidine kinase gene expression in ovarian cancer cells increases cell killing efficacy over time.Adenovirus (ADV)-mediated gene therapy with the thymidine kinase (TK) gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) promotor followed by the administration of acyclovir has been established in vitro for the treatment of ovarian cancer cells and has been used as the basis for intraperitoneal phase I clinical trials. It is unclear how long a significant degree of transgene translation can be expected after adenovirus-mediated TK transduction, where the transcriptional complex is localized in the nucleus in an episomal fashion and thus without stable integration. The possible interaction of acyclovir pretreatment with subsequent ADV-RSV-TK transduction also remains to be elucidated. Transgene expression and cell killing efficacy were analysed based on multiplicity of infection (MOI) and MTT assay. Anti-TK-antibody 1397 was used for immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of TK expression. After transduction with ADV-RSV-TK at an MOI of 66, TK translation increased strongly in MDH 2774 and OVCAR-3 cell lines during the initial 48 hours. Virtually constant expression of the TK transgene was observed by Western blot during eight days. Cell killing efficacy was increased by repeated daily administrations of acyclovir. Pretreatment with acyclovir did not result in significantly increased cell killing efficacy. No negative effect of acyclovir on ADV-RSV-TK transduction was observed. The at least week-long expression of the TK transgene with persistently increasing efficacy of cell killing after ADV-mediated tumor cell transduction provide a realistic basis for the development of multicycle ADV-mediated TK gene therapy approaches in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Continuous i.v. acyclovir treatment or daily oral acyclovir-prodrug therapy might simplify the substrate regimen for the TK gene.",M1
18768972,"Integration of rous sarcoma virus DNA: a CA dinucleotide is not required for integration of the U3 end of viral DNA.The two ends of <e>RSV</e> linear DNA are independently inserted into host DNA by integrase in vivo. We previously showed that the range of U3 sequences that are acceptable substrates for integrase appeared to be greater than the range of acceptable U5 sequences in vivo. We have done additional experiments to determine which U3 sequences are good integrase substrates. On the U3 end, there does not appear to be a stringent requirement for the canonical CA, integrase can efficiently remove three nucleotides, and six nucleotides are sufficient to allow integration with reasonable, albeit reduced, efficiency.",M1
18562520,"The effects of alternate polypurine tracts (PPTs) and mutations of sequences adjacent to the PPT on viral replication and cleavage specificity of the Rous sarcoma virus reverse transcriptase.We previously reported that a mutant Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) with an alternate polypurine tract (PPT), DuckHepBFlipPPT, had unexpectedly high titers and that the PPT was miscleaved primarily at one position following a GA dinucleotide by the RNase H of reverse transcriptase (RT). This miscleavage resulted in a portion of the 3' end of the PPT (5'-ATGTA) being added to the end of U3 of the linear viral DNA. To better understand the RNase H cleavage by RSV RT, we made a number of mutations within the DuckHepBFlipPPT and in the sequences adjacent to the PPT. Deleting the entire ATGTA sequence from the DuckHepBFlipPPT increased the relative titer to wild-type levels, while point mutations within the ATGTA sequence reduced the relative titer but had minimal effects on the cleavage specificity. However, mutating a sequence 5' of ATGTA affected the relative titer of the virus and caused the RNase H of RSV RT to lose the ability to cleave the PPT specifically. In addition, although mutations in the conserved stretch of thymidine residues upstream of the PPT did not affect the relative titer or cleavage specificity, the mutation of some of the nucleotides immediately upstream of the PPT did affect the titer and cleavage specificity. Taken together, our studies show that the structure of the PPT in the context of the cognate RT, rather than a specific sequence, is important for the proper cleavage by RSV RT.",M1
18468873,"Evaluation of promoter strength in mouse and rat primary hepatocytes using adenovirus vectors.Primary cultured hepatocytes are widely used in the studies of basic and clinical hepatology. Finding an efficient method for gene transfer into primary hepatocytes will be an important advance for these studies. In the present study, we evaluated the activity of an adenovirus vector including promoters for the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>), elongation factor 1alpha, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) as well as the beta-actin promoter/CMV enhancer (CA) using beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene. Although RSV and elongation factor 1alpha promoters had low transcriptional activity in hepatocytes, the CA and CMV promoters had high activity. The CA promoter was the most active, mediating 50.3- and 204.4-fold more activity than the RSV promoter in mouse and rat hepatocytes, respectively. Dose-response studies revealed that transgene activity can be controlled by as much as 1000-fold, by selection of the promoter and the number of infectious particles per cell. These findings should help in the construction of adenovirus vectors for expressing genes of interest in rodent primary cultured hepatocytes.",M1
18448521,"Mutations in the spacer peptide and adjoining sequences in Rous sarcoma virus Gag lead to tubular budding.All orthoretroviruses encode a single structural protein, Gag, which is necessary and sufficient for the assembly and budding of enveloped virus-like particles from the cell. The Gag proteins of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contain a short spacer peptide (SP or SP1, respectively) separating the capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. SP or SP1 and the residues immediately upstream are known to be critical for proper assembly. Using mutagenesis and electron microscopy analysis of insect cells or chicken cells overexpressing RSV Gag, we defined the SP assembly domain to include the last 8 residues of CA, all 12 residues of SP, and the first 4 residues of NC. Five- or two-amino acid glycine-rich insertions or substitutions in this critical region uniformly resulted in the budding of abnormal, long tubular particles. The equivalent SP1-containing HIV-1 Gag sequence was unable to functionally replace the RSV sequence in supporting normal RSV spherical assembly. According to secondary structure predictions, RSV and HIV-1 SP/SP1 and adjoining residues may form an alpha helix, and what is likely the functionally equivalent sequence in murine leukemia virus Gag has been inferred by mutational analysis to form an amphipathic alpha helix. However, our alanine insertion mutagenesis did not provide evidence for an amphipathic helix in RSV Gag. Taken together, these results define a short assembly domain between the folded portions of CA and NC, which is essential for formation of the immature Gag shell.",M1
18401344,"A molecular switch required for retrovirus assembly participates in the hexagonal immature lattice.In the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) Gag protein, the 25 amino-acid residues of the p10 domain immediately upstream of the CA domain are essential for immature particle formation. We performed systematic mutagenesis on this region and found excellent correlation between the amino-acid side chains required for in vitro assembly and those that participate in the p10-CA dimer interface in a previously described crystal structure. We introduced exogenous cysteine residues that were predicted to form disulphide bonds across the dimer interface. Upon oxidation of immature particles, a disulphide-linked Gag hexamer was formed, implying that p10 participates in and stabilizes the immature Gag hexamer. This is the first example of a critical interaction between two different Gag domains. Molecular modeling of the RSV immature hexamer indicates that the N-terminal domains of CA must expand relative to the murine leukaemia virus mature hexamer to accommodate the p10 contact; this expansion is strikingly similar to recent cryotomography results for immature human immunodeficiency virus particles.",M1
18283331,"Regulation of mTORC1 signaling by Src kinase activity is Akt1-independent in <e>RSV</e>-transformed cells.Increased activity of the Src tyrosine protein kinase that has been observed in a large number of human malignancies appears to be a promising target for drug therapy. In the present study, a critical role of the Src activity in the deregulation of mTOR signaling pathway in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-transformed hamster fibroblasts, H19 cells, was shown using these cells treated with the Src-specific inhibitor, SU6656, and clones of fibroblasts expressing either the active Src or the dominant-negative Src kinase-dead mutant. Disruption of the Src kinase activity results in substantial reduction of the phosphorylation and activity of the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), phosphorylation of tuberin (TSC2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), S6K1, ribosomal protein S6, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 4E-BP1. The ectopic, active Akt1 that was expressed in Src-deficient cells significantly enhanced phosphorylation of TSC2 in these cells, but it failed to activate the inhibited components of the mTOR pathway that are downstream of TSC2. The data indicate that the Src kinase activity is essential for the activity of mTOR-dependent signaling pathway and suggest that mTOR targets may be controlled by Src independently of Akt1/TSC2 cascade in cells expressing hyperactive Src protein. These observations might have an implication in drug resistance to mTOR inhibitor-based cancer therapy in certain cell types.",M1
18272196,"Characterization of Rous sarcoma virus polyadenylation site use in vitro.Polyadenylation of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) RNA is inefficient, as approximately 15% of RSV RNAs represent read-through transcripts that use a downstream cellular polyadenylation site (poly(A) site). Read-through transcription has implications for the virus and the host since it is associated with oncogene capture and tumor induction. To explore the basis of inefficient RSV RNA 3'-end formation, we characterized RSV polyadenylation in vitro using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and HEK293 whole cell extracts. RSV polyadenylation substrates composed of the natural 3' end of viral RNA and various lengths of upstream sequence showed little or no polyadenylation, indicating that the RSV poly(A) site is suboptimal. Efficiently used poly(A) sites often have identifiable upstream and downstream elements (USEs and DSEs) in close proximity to the conserved AAUAAA signal. The sequences upstream and downstream of the RSV poly(A) site deviate from those found in efficiently used poly(A) sites, which may explain inefficient RSV polyadenylation. To assess the quality of the RSV USEs and DSEs, the well-characterized SV40 late USEs and/or DSEs were substituted for the RSV elements and vice versa, which showed that the USEs and DSEs from RSV are suboptimal but functional. CstF interacted poorly with the RSV polyadenylation substrate, and the inactivity of the RSV poly(A) site was at least in part due to poor CstF binding since tethering CstF to the RSV substrate activated polyadenylation. Our data are consistent with poor polyadenylation factor binding sites in both the USE and DSE as the basis for inefficient use of the RSV poly(A) site and point to the importance of additional elements within RSV RNA in promoting 3' end formation.",M1
18206161,"<e>RSV</e> capsid polymorphism correlates with polymerization efficiency and envelope glycoprotein content: implications that nucleation controls morphogenesis.We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize Rous sarcoma virus, the prototypic alpharetrovirus. Its polyprotein Gag assembles into spherical procapsids, concomitant with budding. In maturation, Gag is dissected into its matrix, capsid protein (CA), and nucleocapsid moieties. CA reassembles into cores housing the viral RNA and replication enzymes. Evidence suggests that a correctly formed core is essential for infectivity. The virions in our data set range from approximately 105 to approximately 175 nm in diameter. Their cores are highly polymorphic. We observe angular cores, including some that are distinctively  coffin-shaped  for which we propose a novel fullerene geometry; cores with continuous curvature including, rarely, fullerene cones; and tubular cores. Angular cores are the most voluminous and densely packed; tubes and some curved cores contain less material, suggesting incomplete packaging. From the tomograms, we measured the surface areas of cores and, hence, their contents of CA subunits. From the virion diameters, we estimated their original complements of Gag. We find that Rous sarcoma virus virions, like the human immunodeficiency virus, contain unassembled CA subunits and that the fraction of CA that is assembled correlates with core type; angular cores incorporate approximately 80% of the available subunits, and open-ended tubes, approximately 30%. The number of glycoprotein spikes is variable (approximately 0 to 118) and also correlates with core type; virions with angular cores average 82 spikes, whereas those with tubular cores average 14 spikes. These observations imply that initiation of CA assembly, in which interactions of spike endodomains with the Gag layer play a role, is a critical determinant of core morphology.",M1
18064718,"Promoters influence the kinetics of transgene expression following adenovector gene delivery.BACKGROUND: The kinetics of gene expression from adenovirus-based delivery vectors will be an important variable influencing the efficacy and toxicity of these vectors. As different promoters have variable strengths and kinetic profiles, the optimal dose of a therapeutic transgene product over time may be achieved by varying the promoter. METHODS: We analyzed several viral and cellular promoters in the context of adenovector gene delivery in the mouse. The kinetics of transgene expression was evaluated following intramuscular and intravenous delivery. RESULTS: Transgene expression from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was rapidly down-regulated in the tissues following intravenous administration of adenovectors. In contrast, transgene expression from the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) promoter increased over time such that, at 3 weeks, expression was 10-fold higher than that from the CMV promoter-containing vector in all tissues. The kinetics of transgene expression from these vectors was similar when they were delivered via the intramuscular route in BALB/c, C57BL/6 and immunodeficient mice. Efficient repeat administration of an adenovirus vector, in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, was achieved in the skeletal muscle and transgene expression persisted with the same kinetics as in naïve animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the in vivo kinetics of transgene expression by adenovectors is greatly influenced by the promoter. Adenovectors can be designed to deliver a transient bolus or a sustained level of protein expression in the target tissue depending on the requirements for particular indications. These results have implications for both therapeutic and vaccine indications.",M1
18057258,"Transgene expression facilitated by the v-src splice acceptor can impair replication kinetics and lead to genomic instability of Rous sarcoma virus-based vectors.Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) can be used for the simple generation of high-titer replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors. Retroviruses undergo frequent genomic recombination, however, and vectors with reduced replication kinetics are rapidly overgrown by mutant forms. Vector design is hence critical to vector efficacy. In this study, two different designs of RSV-based RCR vectors were evaluated. Vectors in which transgene expression was facilitated by the v-src splice acceptor were revealed to have greatly reduced replication kinetics and genomic stability in comparison to vectors in which transgene expression was mediated by an internal ribosome entry site in the 3' untranslated region.",M1
18045996,"Paxillin phosphorylation controls invadopodia/podosomes spatiotemporal organization.In Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>)-transformed baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, invadopodia can self-organize into rings and belts, similarly to podosome distribution during osteoclast differentiation. The composition of individual invadopodia is spatiotemporally regulated and depends on invadopodia localization along the ring section: the actin core assembly precedes the recruitment of surrounding integrins and integrin-linked proteins, whereas the loss of the actin core was a prerequisite to invadopodia disassembly. We have shown that invadopodia ring expansion is controlled by paxillin phosphorylations on tyrosine 31 and 118, which allows invadopodia disassembly. In BHK-RSV cells, ectopic expression of the paxillin mutant Y31F-Y118F induces a delay in invadopodia disassembly and impairs their self-organization. A similar mechanism is unraveled in osteoclasts by using paxillin knockdown. Lack of paxillin phosphorylation, calpain or extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition, resulted in similar phenotype, suggesting that these proteins belong to the same regulatory pathways. Indeed, we have shown that paxillin phosphorylation promotes Erk activation that in turn activates calpain. Finally, we observed that invadopodia/podosomes ring expansion is required for efficient extracellular matrix degradation both in BHK-RSV cells and primary osteoclasts, and for transmigration through a cell monolayer.",M1
18037405,"Foundations in cancer research. The turns of life and science.This chapter provides a personal insight into the scientific and social atmosphere in former Czechoslovakia. It covers the period of the rise of Hasek's immunologic school and application of immunologic tolerance to Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) heterotransmission. These approaches permitted establishment of a new model of mammalian cells transformed by RSV (virogenic XC cells), where the noninfectious viral genome was kept indefinitely as new genetic information (provirus). RSV was rescued from nonpermissive mammalian cells by fusion (complementation) with permissive chicken fibroblasts; this opened the way to understanding virus nonpermissiveness. Mammalian cells transformed by the reverse transcript of v-src mRNA were characterized, and the resulting provirus was shown to be highly oncogenic for chickens and to carry tumor-specific transplantation antigen. Other areas covering epigenetic reversion of RSV-transformed cells and long-term persistence of chicken leucosis viruses in foreign avian species are discussed.",M1
17977961,"Intermolecular interactions between retroviral Gag proteins in the nucleus.The retroviral Gag polyprotein directs virus particle assembly, resulting in the release of virions from the plasma membranes of infected cells. The earliest steps in assembly, those immediately following Gag synthesis, are very poorly understood. For Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>), Gag proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then undergo transient nuclear trafficking before returning to the cytoplasm for transport to the plasma membrane. Thus, RSV provides a useful model to study the initial steps in assembly because the early and later stages are spatially separated by the nuclear envelope. We previously described mutants of RSV Gag that are defective in nuclear export, thereby isolating these  trapped  Gag proteins at an early assembly step. Using the nuclear export mutants, we asked whether Gag protein-protein interactions occur within the nucleus. Complementation experiments revealed that the wild-type Gag protein could partially rescue export-defective Gag mutants into virus-like particles (VLPs). Additionally, the export mutants had a trans-dominant negative effect on wild-type Gag, interfering with its release into VLPs. Confocal imaging of wild-type and mutant Gag proteins bearing different fluorescent tags suggested that complementation between Gag proteins occurred in the nucleus. Additional evidence for nuclear Gag-Gag interactions was obtained using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and we found that the formation of intranuclear Gag complexes was dependent on the NC domain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation allowed the direct visualization of intranuclear Gag-Gag dimers. Together, these experimental results strongly suggest that RSV Gag proteins are capable of interacting within the nucleus.",M1
17959663,"Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) integration in vivo: a CA dinucleotide is not required in U3, and RSV linear DNA does not autointegrate.The sequences required for integration of retroviral DNA have been analyzed in vitro. However, the in vitro experiments do not agree on which sequences are required for integration: for example, whether or not the conserved CA dinucleotide in the 3' end of the viral DNA is required for normal integration. At least a portion of the problem is due to differences in the experimental conditions used in the in vitro assays. To avoid the issue of what experimental conditions to use, we took an in vivo approach. We made mutations in the 5' end of the U3 sequence of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-derived vector RSVP(A)Z. We present evidence that, in RSV, the CA dinucleotide in the 5' end of U3 is not essential for appropriate integration. This result differs from the results seen with mutations in the U5 end, where the CA appears to be essential for proper integration in vivo. In addition, based on the structure of circular viral DNAs smaller than the full-length viral genome, our results suggest that there is little, if any, integrase-mediated autointegration of RSV linear DNA in vivo.",M1
17913830,"Inhibition of alpharetrovirus replication by a range of human APOBEC3 proteins.The mammalian APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases includes members that can act as potent inhibitors of retroviral infectivity and retrotransposon mobility. Here, we have examined whether the alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) is susceptible to inhibition by a range of human APOBEC3 proteins. We report that RSV is highly susceptible to inhibition by human APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3B and moderately susceptible to inhibition by human APOBEC3C and APOBEC3A. For all five proteins, inhibition of RSV infectivity was associated with selective virion incorporation and with C-to-T editing of the proviral DNA minus strand. In the case of APOBEC3G, editing appeared to be critical for effective inhibition. These data represent the first report of inhibition of retroviral infectivity and induction of proviral DNA editing by human APOBEC3A and reveal that alpharetroviruses, which do not normally encounter APOBEC3 proteins in their avian hosts, are susceptible to inhibition by all human APOBEC3 proteins tested. These data further suggest that the resistance of mammalian retroviruses to inhibition by the APOBEC3 proteins expressed in their normal host species is likely to have evolved subsequent to the appearance of this family of mammalian antiretroviral proteins some 35 million years ago; i.e., the base state of a naïve retrovirus is susceptibility to inhibition.",M1
17670832,"Serine/arginine-rich proteins contribute to negative regulator of splicing element-stimulated polyadenylation in rous sarcoma virus.Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) requires large amounts of unspliced RNA for replication. Splicing and polyadenylation are coupled in the cells they infect, which raises the question of how viral RNA is efficiently polyadenylated in the absence of splicing. Optimal RSV polyadenylation requires a far-upstream splicing control element, the negative regulator of splicing (NRS), that binds SR proteins and U1/U11 snRNPs and functions as a pseudo-5' splice site that interacts with and sequesters 3' splice sites. We investigated a link between NRS-mediated splicing inhibition and efficient polyadenylation. In vitro, the NRS alone activated a model RSV polyadenylation substrate, and while the effect did not require the snRNP-binding sites or a downstream 3' splice site, SR proteins were sufficient to stimulate polyadenylation. Consistent with this, SELEX-binding sites for the SR proteins ASF/SF2, 9G8, and SRp20 were able to stimulate polyadenylation when placed upstream of the RSV poly(A) site. In vivo, however, the SELEX sites improved polyadenylation in proviral clones only when the NRS-3' splice site complex could form. Deletions that positioned the SR protein-binding sites closer to the poly(A) site eliminated the requirement for the NRS-3' splice site interaction. This indicates a novel role for SR proteins in promoting RSV polyadenylation in the context of the NRS-3' splice site complex, which is thought to bridge the long distance between the NRS and poly(A) site. The results further suggest a more general role for SR proteins in polyadenylation of cellular mRNAs.",M1
17634229,"Overlapping roles of the Rous sarcoma virus Gag p10 domain in nuclear export and virion core morphology.Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) Gag polyprotein is an integral step in virus particle assembly. A nuclear export signal (NES) was previously identified within the p10 domain of RSV Gag. Gag mutants containing deletions of the p10 NES or mutations of critical hydrophobic residues at positions 219, 222, 225, or 229 become trapped within the nucleus and exhibit defects in the efficiency of virus particle release. To investigate other potential roles for Gag nuclear trafficking in RSV replication, we created viruses bearing NES mutant Gag proteins. Viruses carrying p10 mutations produced low levels of particles, as anticipated, and those particles that were released were noninfectious. The p10 mutant viruses contained approximately normal amounts of Gag, Gag-Pol, and Env proteins and genomic viral RNA (vRNA), but several major structural defects were found. Thin-section transmission electron microscopy revealed that the mature particles appeared misshapen, while the viral cores were cylindrical, horseshoe-shaped, or fragmented, with some particles containing multiple small, electron-dense aggregates. Immature virus-like particles produced by the expression of Gag proteins bearing p10 mutations were also aberrant, with both spherical and tubular filamentous particles produced. Interestingly, the secondary structure of the encapsidated vRNA was altered; although dimeric vRNA was predominant, there was an additional high-molecular-weight fraction. Together, these results indicate that the p10 NES domain of Gag is critical for virus replication and that it plays overlapping roles required for the nuclear shuttling of Gag and for the maintenance of proper virion core morphology.",M1
17448514,"Transcriptional profile of Rous Sarcoma Virus transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts reveals new signaling targets of viral-src.Transformation of chicken fibroblasts in vitro by Rous Sarcoma Virus represents a model of cancer in which a single oncogene, viral src, uniformly and rapidly transforms primary cells in culture. We experimentally surveyed the transcriptional program affected by Rous Sarcoma Virus (<e>RSV</e>) in primary culture of chicken embryo fibroblasts. As a control, we used cells infected with non-transforming RSV mutant td106, in which the src gene was deleted. Using Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome Arrays, we report 811 genes that were modulated more than 2.5 fold in the virus transformed cells. Among these, 409 genes were induced and 402 genes were repressed by viral src. From the repertoire of modulated genes, we selected 20 genes that were robustly changed. We then validated and quantified the transcriptional changes of most of the 20 selected genes by real-time PCR. The set of strongly induced genes contains vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, MAP kinase phosphatase 2 and follistatin, among others. The set of strongly repressed genes contains TGF beta 3, TGF beta-induced gene, and deiodinase. The function of several robustly modulated genes sheds new light on the molecular mechanism of oncogenic transformation.",M1
17328934,"Tap and Dbp5, but not Gag, are involved in DR-mediated nuclear export of unspliced Rous sarcoma virus RNA.All retroviruses must circumvent cellular restrictions on the export of unspliced RNAs from the nucleus. While the unspliced RNA export pathways for HIV and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus are well characterized, that of Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) is not. We have previously reported that the RSV direct repeat (DR) elements are involved in the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced viral RNA. Here, using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that unspliced viral RNAs bearing a single point mutation (G8863C) in the DR exhibit a restricted cellular localization in and around the nucleus. In contrast, wild type unspliced viral RNA had a diffuse localization throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. Since the RSV Gag protein has a transient localization in the nucleus, we examined the effect of Gag over-expression on a DR-mediated reporter construct. While Gag did not enhance DR-mediated nuclear export, the dominant-negative expression of two cellular export factors, Tap and Dbp5, inhibited expression of the same reporter construct. Furthermore, FISH studies using the dominant-negative Dbp5 demonstrated that unspliced wild type RSV RNA was retained within the nucleus. Taken together, these results further implicate the DR in nuclear RNA export through interactions with Tap and Dbp5.",M1
17093186,"Genetic Studies of the beta-hairpin loop of Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein.The first few residues of the Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) CA protein comprise a structurally dynamic region that forms part of a Gag-Gag interface in immature virus particles. Dissociation of this interaction during maturation allows refolding and formation of a beta-hairpin structure important for assembly of CA monomers into the mature capsid shell. A consensus binding site for the cellular Ubc9 protein was previously identified within this region, suggesting that binding of Ubc9 and subsequent small ubiquitin-like modifier protein 1 (SUMO-1) modification of CA may play a role either in regulating the assembly activity of CA in immature particles or mature cores or in controlling postentry function(s) during the establishment of infection. In the present study, mutations designed to eliminate the consensus binding site were used to dissect the potentially overlapping functions of these residues. The resulting replication defects could not be traced to a failure to form particles of normal composition but, rather, to a deficit in genome replication. Genetic suppressors of two detrimental beta-hairpin mutations improved infectivity without restoring the consensus site or creating a novel one elsewhere. Optimal restoration of infectivity to a Lys-to-Arg mutant required a combination of secondary changes, one on the surface of each domain of CA. Rather than arguing for a critical role of Ubc9 and SUMO in RSV replication, these findings provide strong support for a structural role of the N-terminal residues and a particularly striking example of long-range interactions between regions of CA in achieving a functional core competent for genome replication.",M1
17070546,"Solution structure of the Rous sarcoma virus nucleocapsid protein: muPsi RNA packaging signal complex.The 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of retroviral genomes contains elements required for genome packaging during virus assembly. For many retroviruses, the packaging elements reside in non-contiguous segments that span most or all of the 5'-UTR. The Rous sarcoma virus (<e>RSV</e>) is an exception, in that its genome can be packaged efficiently by a relatively short, 82 nt segment of the 5'-UTR called muPsi. The RSV 5'-UTR also contains three translational start codons (AUG-1, AUG-2 and AUG-3) that have been controvertibly implicated in translation initiation and genome packaging, one of which (AUG-3) resides within the muPsi sequence. We demonstrated recently that muPsi is capable of binding to the cognate RSV nucleocapsid protein (NC) with high affinity (dissociation constant K(d) approximately 2 nM), and that residues of AUG-3 are essential for tight binding. We now report the solution structure of the NC:muPsi complex, determined using NMR data obtained for samples containing ((13)C,(15)N)-labeled NC and (2)H-enriched, nucleotide-specifically protonated RNAs. Upon NC binding, muPsi adopts a stable secondary structure that consists of three stem loops (SL-A, SL-B and SL-C) and an 8 bp stem (O3). Binding is mediated by the two zinc knuckle domains of NC. The N-terminal knuckle interacts with a conserved U(217)GCG tetraloop (a member of the UNCG family; N=A,U,G or C), and the C-terminal zinc knuckle binds to residues that flank SL-A, including residues of AUG-3. Mutations of critical nucleotides in these sequences compromise or abolish viral infectivity. Our studies reveal novel structural features important for NC:RNA binding, and support the hypothesis that AUG-3 is conserved for genome packaging rather than translational control.",M1
20419825,"Functional disorder of primary immunity responding to respiratory syncytial virus infection in offspring mice exposed to a flame retardant, decabrominated diphenyl ether, perinatally.Perinatal exposure to a representative flame retardant, decabrominated diphenyl ether (DBDE), was shown previously to increase viral titers in the lungs of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>)-infected offspring on day 5 post-infection, resulting in exacerbation of pneumonia. In this study, the significant increase of pulmonary viral titers was confirmed even on day 1 post-infection and the effect on the primary immune response to RSV infection were examined to assess a mode of DBDE action on developmental immunotoxicity. On day 1 after infection, the secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 decreased significantly in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid prepared from RSV-infected offspring exposed to DBDE perinatally, but IL-1beta increased. However, in ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation test, the productivity of TNF-alpha in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells, which are mainly primary immune cells responding to RSV infection, prepared from offspring mice exposed to DBDE perinatally was not lower than that in the control. The primary immune cells retained normally the ability of cytokine production after the DBDE exposure. Gene expressions of innate pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptor 3 and 4, melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I) in lung tissues were not affected by DBDE exposure. Because the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta are known to be elevated in the lungs of RSV-infected mice, these irregular productions due to perinatal DBDE exposure indicate a disorder of the primary immune response to RSV infection. Thus, perinatal exposure to DBDE was suggested to cause a functional disorder of primary immunity responding to RSV infection.",M2
20404812,"Control of <e>RSV</e>-induced lung injury by alternatively activated macrophages is IL-4R alpha-, TLR4-, and IFN-beta-dependent.Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis has been associated with a mixed  Th1  and  Th2  cytokine storm. We hypothesized that differentiation of  alternatively activated  macrophages (AA-M phi) would mediate the resolution of RSV-induced lung injury. RSV induced interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by murine lung and peritoneal macrophages, IL-4R alpha/STAT6-dependent AA-M phi differentiation, and significantly enhanced inflammation in the lungs of IL-4R alpha(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer of wildtype macrophages to IL-4R alpha(-/-) mice restored RSV-inducible AA-M phi phenotype and diminished lung pathology. RSV-infected Toll-like receptor (TLR)4(-/-) and interferon (IFN)-beta(-/-) macrophages and mice also failed to express AA-M phi markers, but exhibited sustained proinflammatory cytokine production (e.g., IL-12) in vitro and in vivo and epithelial damage in vivo. TLR4 signaling is required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression, a DNA-binding protein that induces AA-M phi genes, whereas IFN-beta regulates IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R alpha, and IL-10 expression in response to RSV. RSV-infected cotton rats treated with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor increased expression of lung AA-M phi. These data suggest new treatment strategies for RSV that promote AA-M phi differentiation.",M2
20350426,"[Microbiological etiology in children with community acquired pneumonia]OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. METHODS: Respiratory secretion and blood specimens were collected in 1167 children with CAP within 4 hrs of admission. Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia trachomatis were detected by RT-PCR in respiratory secretion specimens. Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>-IgM) and Adenovirus (ADV-IgM) were tested using ELISA in blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 308 strains of bacteria were isolated from the respiratory tract secretions, with gram positive strains of 53.6% and gram negative strains of 46.4%. The top five bacteria strains detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), Escherichia coli (11.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.8%), Klebsiella pneumonia (6.5%) and Moraxelle catarrhalis (5.8%) in turn. Beta-lactamase and ESBLs producing strains accounted for 30.1% in the top five bacteria strains. The non-bacteria pathogens were found in 281 specimens (24.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus accounted for the most prevalent pathogen (19.3%). The mixed infection of respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae was common (35.2%). The infection rate from most of pathogenic microorganisms among children under the age of one was higher than that in children over one year old. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens of CAP in children. The risk of pathogenic microorganism infections in children under the age of one is higher than that of children over one year old.",M2
20350162,"Respiratory virus pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): associations between viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage samples, viral RNA detection in serum samples, and clinical outcomes of HCT.BACKGROUND: Few data exist on respiratory virus quantitation in lower respiratory samples and detection in serum from hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with respiratory virus-associated pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus (MPV), and coronavirus (CoV) detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, and we tested stored BAL and/or serum samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In 85 BAL samples from 82 patients, median viral loads were as follows: for RSV (n = 35), 2.6 x 10(6) copies/mL; for parainfluenza virus (n = 35), 4.9 x 10(7) copies/mL; for influenza virus (n = 9), 6.8 x 10(5) copies/mL; for MPV (n = 7), 3.9 x 10(7) copies/mL; and for CoV (n = 4), 1.8 x 10(5) copies/mL. Quantitative viral load was not associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Viral RNA was detected in serum samples from 6 of 66 patients: 4 of 41 with RSV pneumonia, 1 with influenza B, and 1 with MPV/influenza A virus/CoV coinfection (influenza A virus and MPV RNA detected). RSV detection in serum was associated with high viral load in BAL samples (p = .05), and viral RNA detection in serum was significantly associated with death (adjusted rate ratio, 1.8; (p = .02). CONCLUSION: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction detects high viral loads in BAL samples from HCT recipients with respiratory virus pneumonia. Viral RNA is also detectable in the serum of patients with RSV, influenza, and MPV pneumonia and may correlate with the severity of disease.",M2
20235102,"Methods for monitoring dynamics of pulmonary <e>RSV</e> replication by viral culture and by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in vivo: Detection of abortive viral replication.Viral infection is normally detected either by viral culture or by PCR methods. Rarely is a combination of the two techniques used in the same study. Yet, when applied simultaneously, viral culture and PCR may reveal important features of viral biology, such as an abortive replication, as in the case of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. In this unit, we describe methods for detecting abortive RSV replication in a cotton rat model by using the plaque-forming unit assay and the real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. All steps of the process of monitoring viral replication in vivo are described, starting from the design of animal infection protocols.

20205592,"Respiratory syncytial virus F and G proteins induce interleukin 1alpha, CC, and CXC chemokine responses by normal human bronchoepithelial cells.Human respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is a ubiquitous respiratory virus that causes serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. Studies have shown that RSV infection modulates chemokine expression patterns, suggesting that particular cytokine expression profiles may be indicators of disease severity. In this study, we show that RSV F or G protein treatment of fully differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells induces apical and basolateral secretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted). Purified RSV G (attachment) protein was shown to stimulate the secretion of interleukin 1alpha and RANTES, whereas purified F (fusion) protein elicited the production of IL-8, IP-10, and RANTES. Studies of ultraviolet-inactivated RSV showed that treatment of normal human bronchial epithelial cells induces apical IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 secretion independent of infection, suggesting that RSV proteins alone modify the chemokine response pattern, which may affect the early immune response before infection.",M2
20200251,"Delivery of cytokines by recombinant virus in early life alters the immune response to adult lung infection.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is the main cause of bronchiolitis, the major cause of hospitalization of infants. An ideal RSV vaccine would be effective for neonates, but the immune responses of infants differ markedly from those of adults, often showing a bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) responses and reduced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production. We previously developed recombinant RSV vectors expressing IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) that allow us to explore the role of these key Th1 and Th2 cytokines during infection. The aim of the current study was to explore whether an immunomodulation of infant responses could enhance protection. The expression of IFN-gamma by a recombinant RSV vector (RSV/IFN-gamma) attenuated primary viral replication in newborn mice without affecting the development of specific antibody or T-cell responses. Upon challenge, RSV/IFN-gamma mice were protected from the exacerbated disease observed for mice primed with wild-type RSV; however, antiviral immunity was not enhanced. Conversely, the expression of IL-4 by recombinant RSV did not affect virus replication in neonates but greatly enhanced Th2 immune responses upon challenge without affecting weight loss. These studies demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate infant immune responses by using cytokine-expressing recombinant viruses and that neonatal deficiency in IFN-gamma responses may lead to enhanced disease during secondary infection.",M2

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological differences between HMPV- and RSV-induced wheezing illnesses. A total of 1,008 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens was collected from 1,008 pediatric patients hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital from December 2003 to April 2008, and tested for seven common respiratory viruses. Conditions classified as wheezing illness were bronchiolitis, reactive airways disease, and bronchial asthma. HMPV caused a significantly lower proportion of wheezing illness when compared to RSV (48.1% vs. 82.2%, P&lt;0.05). HMPV-induced wheezing illness occurred predominantly in older patients when compared to RSV patients (P&lt;0.001). RSV infections peaked in the fall and winter followed by peaks of HMPV infection in winter and spring. Eosinophil counts were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in RSV patients when compared to HMPV patients. These results show that human metapneumovirus patients exhibit several different clinical and epidemiological characteristics, such as higher proportion of wheezing illness, age and seasonal incidence, and eosinophil counts, when compared to RSV patients.",M2
20153523,"The effect of grafted methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) chain length on the inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection and proliferation.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of morbidity in humans. To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only approximately 50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2 kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20 kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (approximately 0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48 hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15 mm, 20 kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEG-modification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.",M2

This study investigated the genetic variability of the attachment (G) protein gene among RSV strains prevalent in southwestern China. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for a fragment of the RSV G gene was performed with nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children with ARIs hospitalized in Chongqing Children's Hospital, Chongqing, China. A total of 1,387 NPA specimens were collected from April 2006 to March 2009, and 439 (31.7%) were positive for RSV. During the study period, subgroup A and B viruses accounted for 79.5% (349/439) and 19.8% (87/439) of the total positive samples, respectively. Both subgroup A and B viruses were identified in three samples. Subgroup A viruses were predominant during two epidemic seasons (2006 to 2008), while subgroup B strains prevailed during the 2008-2009 epidemic season. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all 30 group A strains could be clustered into one genotype, genotype GA2, and 30 group B strains could be clustered into three genotypes, genotypes GB1, GB3, and BA, among which 17 genotype BA strains were detected from 23 group B strains selected during the 2008-2009 epidemic season. The G gene of genotype BA was predicted to encode proteins of five different lengths. These data suggest that group A RSV likely predominated in southwestern China and that a new genotype of subgroup B with a 60-nucleotide insertion, named BA-like virus, became the dominant genotype in the 2008-2009 epidemic season.",M2

METHODS: The expressions of mRNA and protein of ICAM-1 were determined in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells after being infected by the LONG strain type A RSV and in normal fibroblast cells with real-time PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mRNA of ICAM-1 expression in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells was 2.51 times at 24 h post-infection as that in normal fibroblast cells (P &lt; 0.05). The protein of ICAM-1 expression of RSV control group (1.25 +/- 0.09, 1.87 +/- 0.18, 4.78 +/- 0.52, 13.34 +/- 0.64, 1.58 +/- 0.37) were significantly higher than those of normal cell group (0.21 +/- 0.06, 0.30 +/- 0.06, 0.29 +/- 0.07, 0.35 +/- 0.17, 0.35 +/- 0.14) at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection (all P &lt; 0.01). The protein of ICAM-1 expression of RSV control group achieved a peak value between 48 h and 72 h, and then it decreased significantly at 96 h.

20130064,"Interleukin 18 coexpression during respiratory syncytial virus infection results in enhanced disease mediated by natural killer cells.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) causes bronchiolitis, the main cause of infantile hospitalization. Immunity against reinfection is poor, and there is great interest in boosting vaccine responses using live vectors expressing host cytokines. We therefore constructed a recombinant RSV expressing murine interleukin 18 (RSV/IL-18), a cytokine capable of inducing strong antiviral immune responses. In vitro RSV/IL-18 replicated at wild-type levels and produced soluble IL-18. In naïve BALB/c mice, RSV/IL-18 infection significantly increased both IL-18 mRNA and protein and attenuated the peak viral load 3-fold. Despite a reduced viral load, RSV/IL-18 infection caused a biphasic weight loss at days 2 and 6 postinfection that was not seen in wild-type infection. Day 2 disease was associated with enhanced pulmonary natural killer (NK) cell numbers and activity and was prevented by NK cell depletion during infection; day 6 disease was correlated with CD8 T-cell recruitment and was enhanced by NK cell depletion. IL-18 expression during priming also enhanced RSV-specific antibody responses and T-cell responses on secondary RSV infection. Therefore, while IL-18 boosted antiviral immunity and reduced the viral load, its coexpression worsened disease. This is the first recombinant RSV with this property, and these are the first studies to demonstrate that NK cells can induce pathology during pulmonary viral infections.",M2
20122285,"Early-life viral infection and allergen exposure interact to induce an asthmatic phenotype in mice.BACKGROUND: Early-life respiratory viral infections, notably with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), increase the risk of subsequent development of childhood asthma. The purpose of this study was to assess whether early-life infection with a species-specific model of RSV and subsequent allergen exposure predisposed to the development of features of asthma. METHODS: We employed a unique combination of animal models in which BALB/c mice were neonatally infected with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM, which replicates severe RSV disease in human infants) and following recovery, were intranasally sensitised with ovalbumin. Animals received low-level challenge with aerosolised antigen for 4 weeks to elicit changes of chronic asthma, followed by a single moderate-level challenge to induce an exacerbation of inflammation. We then assessed airway inflammation, epithelial changes characteristic of remodelling, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and host immunological responses. RESULTS: Allergic airway inflammation, including recruitment of eosinophils, was prominent only in animals that had recovered from neonatal infection with PVM and then been sensitised and chronically challenged with antigen. Furthermore, only these mice exhibited an augmented Th2-biased immune response, including elevated serum levels of anti-ovalbumin IgE and IgG1 as well as increased relative expression of Th2-associated cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. By comparison, development of AHR and mucous cell change were associated with recovery from PVM infection, regardless of subsequent allergen challenge. Increased expression of IL-25, which could contribute to induction of a Th2 response, was demonstrable in the lung following PVM infection. Signalling via the IL-4 receptor alpha chain was crucial to the development of allergic inflammation, mucous cell change and AHR, because all of these were absent in receptor-deficient mice. In contrast, changes of remodelling were evident in mice that received chronic allergen challenge, regardless of neonatal PVM infection, and were not dependent on signalling via the IL-4 receptor. CONCLUSION: In this mouse model, interaction between early-life viral infection and allergen sensitisation/challenge is essential for development of the characteristic features of childhood asthma, including allergic inflammation and a Th2-biased immune response.",M2
20121698,"The role of Toll-like receptors in regulating the immune response against respiratory syncytial virus.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a distinct role in battling respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infections. However, due to a lack of representative animal models and several early controversies, the field is unclear. In this systematic review, we have elucidated conflicting results and outlined important factors that might affect study outcomes. We reviewed studies that used different doses/viral strains, performed virus propagation in different cell lines, or used different mice strains. The following firm conclusions can be drawn: multiple TLRs activate innate immunity upon RSV infection; TLR4 can influence TLR2 expression, suggesting that optimal induction of multiple signaling pathways is required to elicit protective, rather than deleterious innate immune responses following infection; in mice, TLR4, TLR2/-6, and TLR7 have immune-stimulating properties, while TLR3 activation occurs later and appears to downregulate immune responses; in humans, polymorphism studies have demonstrated an important role for TLR4-signaling; and activation of TLR-signaling leads to antiviral cytokine production, such as TNF-a and IFNs. Viral factors may block these pathways, thereby contributing to immune evasion and RSV survival. A better understanding of the complex interplay between TLRs and severe RSV infections might lead to efficient prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, as well as the development of adequate vaccines combined with TLR adjuvants.",M2
20121401,"Pulmonary cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 cellular expression and distribution after respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus infection.Prostaglandins (PGs) play an important role in pulmonary physiology and various pathophysiological processes following infection. The initial step in the biosynthesis of PGs is regulated by two distinct cyclooxygenase enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2. The goal of this study was to investigate the pulmonary cellular localization and distribution of COX-1 and COX-2 in a neonatal lamb model following respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and parainfluenza virus 3 (PI3) infection, organisms that also cause significant respiratory disease in children. No significant differences were seen in pulmonary COX-1 expression at various microanatomical locations following RSV or PI3 infection compared to controls. In contrast, COX-2 was upregulated following RSV and PI3 infection. Strong expression was restricted to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and macrophages, while minimal expression was present in the same microanatomical locations in the uninfected lungs. Other microanatomical locations in both the controls and the infected lungs lacked expression. This work suggests that during RSV or PI3 infection: (1) COX-1 cellular expression is not altered, (2) COX-2 cellular expression is upregulated in airway bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages, (3) respiratory epithelium along with macrophages are important microanatomical compartments regulating the host inflammatory response during viral infection, and (4) COX-2 may be a potential target for RSV and PI3 therapy.",M2
20103834,"Anti-virus effect of traditional Chinese medicine Yi-Fu-Qing granule on acute respiratory tract infections.Yi-Fu-Qing granule is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. The present study sought to investigate the anti-virus effects of Yi-Fu-Qing granule on acute respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and human adenoviruses type 3 (Ad3). The cytotoxicity of Yi-Fu-Qing granule was evaluated by the neutral red assay on HeLa cells. The antiviral effect of Yi-Fu-Qing granule was tested by observing the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) with a compound mixture of Isatis leaf as the positive control drug. The results indicated that the highest non-toxicity concentration of Yi-Fu-Qing granule on Hela cells was 1:100. The CPE reduction assay showed that Yi-Fu-Qing granule inhibited RSV and Ad3 replication at a concentration of 1:100. Thus, Yi-Fu-Qing granule may have a significant antivirus effect on acute respiratory tract infections with RSV and Ad3 infections and this could prove useful for further antivirus research on acute respiratory tract infections.",M2
20102602,"Inactivation of respiratory syncytial virus by zinc finger reactive compounds.BACKGROUND: Infectivity of retroviruses such as HIV-1 and MuLV can be abrogated by compounds targeting zinc finger motif in viral nucleocapsid protein (NC), involved in controlling the processivity of reverse transcription and virus infectivity. Although a member of a different viral family (Pneumoviridae), respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) contains a zinc finger protein M2-1 also involved in control of viral polymerase processivity. Given the functional similarity between the two proteins, it was possible that zinc finger-reactive compounds inactivating retroviruses would have a similar effect against RSV by targeting RSV M2-1 protein. Moreover, inactivation of RSV through modification of an internal protein could yield a safer whole virus vaccine than that produced by RSV inactivation with formalin which modifies surface proteins. RESULTS: Three compounds were evaluated for their ability to reduce RSV infectivity: 2,2'-dithiodipyridine (AT-2), tetraethylthiuram disulfide and tetramethylthiuram disulfide. All three were capable of inactivating RSV, with AT-2 being the most potent. The mechanism of action of AT-2 was analyzed and it was found that AT-2 treatment indeed results in the modification of RSV M2-1. Altered intramolecular disulfide bond formation in M2-1 protein of AT-2-treated RSV virions might have been responsible for abrogation of RSV infectivity. AT-2-inactivated RSV was found to be moderately immunogenic in the cotton rats S.hispidus and did not cause a vaccine-enhancement seen in animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated RSV. Increasing immunogenicity of AT-2-inactivated RSV by adjuvant (Ribi), however, led to vaccine-enhanced disease. CONCLUSIONS: This work presents evidence that compounds that inactivate retroviruses by targeting the zinc finger motif in their nucleocapsid proteins are also effective against RSV. AT-2-inactivated RSV vaccine is not strongly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvants. In the adjuvanted form, however, vaccine induces immunopathologic response. The mere preservation of surface antigens of RSV, therefore may not be sufficient to produce a highly-efficacious inactivated virus vaccine that does not lead to an atypical disease.",M2
20101616,"CCL20/CCR6 blockade enhances immunity to <e>RSV</e> by impairing recruitment of DC.Chemokines are important mediators of the immune response to pathogens, but can also promote chronic inflammatory states. Chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) is found on immature DC and effector/memory T cells, and binds a single ligand, CCL20, with high affinity. Here, we investigated the role of CCL20 and CCR6 in a pulmonary viral infection caused by RSV, a ubiquitous virus that can cause severe pulmonary complications. Neutralization of CCL20 during RSV infection significantly reduced lung pathology and favored a Th1 effector response. CCR6-deficient animals recapitulated this phenotype, and additionally showed enhanced viral clearance when compared with WT mice. No differences were observed in migration of T cells to the lungs of CCR6(-/-) animals; however, a significant reduction was observed in numbers of conventional DC (cDC), but not plasmacytoid DC, in CCR6(-/-) mice. A pathogenic phenotype could be reconstituted in CCR6(-/-) mice by supplying cDC into the airway, indicating that mere number of cDC dictates the adverse response. Our data suggest that blockade of the CCL20/CCR6 pathway provides an environment whereby the attenuated recruitment of cDC alters the balance of innate immune cells and mediates the efficient antiviral response to RSV.",M2
20098425,"Structural basis of respiratory syncytial virus neutralization by motavizumab.Motavizumab is approximately tenfold more potent than its predecessor, palivizumab (Synagis), the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody used to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection. The structure of motavizumab in complex with a 24-residue peptide corresponding to its epitope on the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein reveals the structural basis for this greater potency. Modeling suggests that motavizumab recognizes a different quaternary configuration of the F glycoprotein than that observed in a homologous structure.",M2
20096106,"Duration of shedding of respiratory syncytial virus in a community study of Kenyan children.BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the transmission dynamics of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection will be better informed with improved data on the patterns of shedding in cases not limited only to hospital admissions. METHODS: In a household study, children testing RSV positive by direct immunofluorescent antibody test (DFA) were enrolled. Nasal washings were scheduled right away, then every three days until day 14, every 7 days until day 28 and every 2 weeks until a maximum of 16 weeks, or until the first DFA negative RSV specimen. The relationship between host factors, illness severity and viral shedding was investigated using Cox regression methods. RESULTS: From 151 families a total of 193 children were enrolled with a median age of 21 months (range 1-164 months), 10% infants and 46% male. The rate of recovery from infection was 0.22/person/day (95% CI 0.19-0.25) equivalent to a mean duration of shedding of 4.5 days (95%CI 4.0-5.3), with a median duration of shedding of 4 days (IQR 2-6, range 1-14). Children with a history of RSV infection had a 40% increased rate of recovery i.e. shorter duration of viral shedding (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.01-1.86). The rate of cessation of shedding did not differ significantly between males and females, by severity of infection or by age. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of a relationship between the duration of shedding and history of infection, which may have a bearing on the relative role of primary versus re-infections in RSV transmission in the community.",M2
20081068,"Anti-inflammatory effect of MUC1 during respiratory syncytial virus infection of lung epithelial cells in vitro.MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells and plays an anti-inflammatory role during airway bacterial infection. In this study, we determined whether the anti-inflammatory effect of MUC1 is also operative during the respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection. The lung epithelial cell line A549 was treated with RSV, and the production of TNFalpha and the levels of MUC1 protein were monitored temporally during the course of infection by ELISA and Western blot analysis. Small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) transfection was utilized to assess the role of MUC1 in regulating RSV-mediated inflammatory responses by lung epithelial cells. Our results revealed that: 1) following RSV infection, an increase in MUC1 level was preceded by an increase in TNFalpha production and completely inhibited by soluble TNF receptor (TNFR); and 2) knockdown of MUC1 using MUC1 siRNA resulted in a greater increase in TNFalpha level following RSV infection compared with control siRNA treatment. We conclude that the RSV-induced increase in the TNFalpha levels upregulates MUC1 through its interaction with TNFR, which in turn suppresses further increase in TNFalpha by RSV, thus forming a negative feedback loop in the control of RSV-induced inflammation. This is the first demonstration showing that MUC1 can suppress the virus-induced inflammatory responses.",M2
20080799,"Pulmonary surfactant phosphatidylglycerol inhibits respiratory syncytial virus-induced inflammation and infection.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory tract infection in young children. It is also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals and in persons with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, no reliable vaccine or simple RSV antiviral therapy is available. Recently, we determined that the minor pulmonary surfactant phospholipid, palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), could markedly attenuate inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide through direct interactions with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) interacting proteins CD14 and MD-2. CD14 and TLR4 have been implicated in the host response to RSV. Treatment of bronchial epithelial cells with POPG significantly inhibited interleukin-6 and -8 production, as well as the cytopathic effects induced by RSV. The phospholipid bound RSV with high affinity and inhibited viral attachment to HEp2 cells. POPG blocked viral plaque formation in vitro by 4 log units, and markedly suppressed the expansion of plaques from cells preinfected with the virus. Administration of POPG to mice, concomitant with viral infection, almost completely eliminated the recovery of virus from the lungs at 3 and 5 days after infection, and abrogated IFN-gamma (IFN-gamma) production and the enhanced expression of surfactant protein D (SP-D). These findings demonstrate an important approach to prevention and treatment of RSV infections using exogenous administration of a specific surfactant phospholipid.",M2
20049806,"Nanoparticle vaccines against respiratory viruses.Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI-3V) are the major viral agents which are consistently involved in causing lower respiratory tract disease in humans and animals. The virus infection begins in the upper respiratory tract, where immune responses are initiated, and then progresses to the lower respiratory tract where destruction of cells and tissues leads to bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, which is occasionally fatal. Nanoparticle vaccines, incorporating antigenic components from influenza, RSV, or PI-3V have been shown to be capable of stimulating mucosal and systemic immune responses, which can prevent the spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract. The encapsulation of viral proteins within nanoparticles may also facilitate production of respiratory vaccines which are efficacious in infants, where presence of maternally derived antibodies can reduce vaccine efficacy.",M2
20041158,"Genetics, recombination and clinical features of human rhinovirus species C (HRV-C) infections; interactions of HRV-C with other respiratory viruses.To estimate the frequency, molecular epidemiological and clinical associations of infection with the newly described species C variants of human rhinoviruses (HRV), 3243 diagnostic respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing in Edinburgh were screened using a VP4-encoding region-based selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HRV-C along with parallel PCR testing for 13 other respiratory viruses. HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6-12 months; 80% of infections in those &lt;2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5'UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening.",M2
20027974,"[The burden and outcomes of acute bronchiolitis among young children hospitalized in Israel]BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis (AB) is a significant indication for hospitalization during the winter period. Underlying conditions increase risk for severe manifestations. AIMS: To estimate the burden and outcomes of AB in northern Israel. METHODS: A prospective study was performed between 1.12.2005 - 31.3.2006. Previously healthy children younger than 2 years of age, hospitalized with the diagnosis of AB, in three hospitals in northern Israel, were included in this study. RESULTS: Overall, 465 children (93%) out of 500 children who were hospitalized due to AB and comprised 18% of all hospitalizations during the study period, were included. A pathogen was identified in 91% of cases. A single pathogen was identified in 243 (52%) cases; 2-4 pathogens were found in 176 (39%) children. Common pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and Rhinovirus in 346 (75%) and 129 (28%), of which 192 (41%) and 37 (8%) were sole pathogens respectively. Complete data were available for 390 (82%) children, of whom 78% were younger than 6 months. Patients were hospitalized for 4 +/- 4.4 days; 15 children were treated in intensive care. There was one mortality. An X-ray was performed in 94% of cases. Most children were treated with multiple regimens including intravenous fluids, O2 supplement, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, steroids and antibiotics. Bronchiolitis was attributed to 18% of hospitalizations. On a national scale, assuming that the policy of hospitalization is similar, 4100 children were hospitalized due to AB. This reflects 4% of all hospitalized children a year in Israel and attributing to 16,400 hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: AB is associated with a huge burden, during a short period of the year, on pediatric departments, mainly attributed by infants younger than 6 months of age. The development of effective vaccine against RSV may significantly reduce the burden of morbidity.",M2
20015999,"Genomewide association analysis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, with about half being infected in their first year of life. Yet only 2 to 3% of infants are hospitalized for RSV infection, suggesting that individual susceptibility contributes to disease severity. Previously, we determined that AKR/J (susceptible) mice developed high lung RSV titers and showed delayed weight recovery, whereas C57BL/6J (resistant) mice demonstrated low lung RSV titers and rapid weight recovery. In addition, we have reported that gene-targeted mice lacking the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr; ATP-binding cassette subfamily C, member 7) are susceptible to RSV infection. For this report, recombinant backcross and F2 progeny derived from C57BL/6J and AKR/J mice were infected with RSV, their lung titers were measured, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed. A major QTL, designated Rsvs1, was identified on proximal mouse chromosome 6 in both recombinant populations. Microarray analysis comparing lung transcripts of the parental strains during infection identified several candidate genes that mapped to the Rsvs1 interval, including Cftr. These findings add to our understanding of individual RSV susceptibility and strongly support a modifier role for CFTR in RSV infection, a significant cause of respiratory morbidity in infants with cystic fibrosis.",M2
20008294,"Vitamin D decreases respiratory syncytial virus induction of NF-kappaB-linked chemokines and cytokines in airway epithelium while maintaining the antiviral state.Epidemiological studies suggest that low vitamin D levels may increase the risk or severity of respiratory viral infections. In this study, we examined the effect of vitamin D on respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>)-infected human airway epithelial cells. Airway epithelium converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (storage form) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (active form). Active vitamin D, generated locally in tissues, is important for the nonskeletal actions of vitamin D, including its effects on immune responses. We found that vitamin D induces IkappaBalpha, an NF-kappaB inhibitor, in airway epithelium and decreases RSV induction of NF-kappaB-driven genes such as IFN-beta and CXCL10. We also found that exposing airway epithelial cells to vitamin D reduced induction of IFN-stimulated proteins with important antiviral activity (e.g., myxovirus resistance A and IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa). In contrast to RSV-induced gene expression, vitamin D had no effect on IFN signaling, and isolated IFN induced gene expression. Inhibiting NF-kappaB with an adenovirus vector that expressed a nondegradable form of IkappaBalpha mimicked the effects of vitamin D. When the vitamin D receptor was silenced with small interfering RNA, the vitamin D effects were abolished. Most importantly we found that, despite inducing IkappaBalpha and dampening chemokines and IFN-beta, there was no increase in viral mRNA or protein or in viral replication. We conclude that vitamin D decreases the inflammatory response to viral infections in airway epithelium without jeopardizing viral clearance. This suggests that adequate vitamin D levels would contribute to reduced inflammation and less severe disease in RSV-infected individuals.",M2
19965982,"Respiratory syncytial virus induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists in BALB/c mice.beta-Adrenergic agonists (beta-agonists) are commonly used to treat respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) bronchiolitis but are generally ineffective for unknown reasons. We have previously shown that RSV strain A2 inhibits bronchoalveolar epithelial responses to beta-agonists in a BALB/c mouse model by inducing heterologous keratinocyte cytokine (KC)/CXCR2-mediated desensitization of epithelial beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. The aim of the current study was to determine whether RSV also induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists. Total lung resistance (R) was measured in anesthetized female BALB/c mice undergoing mechanical ventilation on a flexiVent computer-controlled piston ventilator. Data were analyzed using the single-compartment model. Infection with RSV A2 did not induce airway hyperresponsiveness to increasing doses of the nebulized cholinergic agonist methacholine (MCh) at any time point after RSV infection. Prenebulization with the beta-agonist terbutaline (100 muM) significantly attenuated bronchoconstrictive responses to 20 and 50 mg/ml MCh in uninfected mice and in mice infected with RSV 4-8 days postinfection (d.p.i.). However, in mice infected with replication-competent, but not UV-inactivated, RSV for 2 days, significant terbutaline insensitivity was found. Terbutaline insensitivity at 2 d.p.i. could be reversed by systemic preinfection treatment with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 antibodies, which reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil counts but did not alter viral replication, BAL KC levels, or lung edema. Terbutaline insensitivity was also reversed by postinfection nebulization with neutralizing anti-KC or anti-CXCR2 antibodies and could be replicated in normal, uninfected mice by nebulization with recombinant KC. These data suggest that KC/CXCR2-mediated airway insensitivity to beta-agonists may underlie the modest utility of these drugs as bronchodilators in therapy for acute RSV bronchiolitis.",M2
19965480,"Crystal structure of a nucleocapsid-like nucleoprotein-RNA complex of respiratory syncytial virus.The respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is an important human pathogen, yet neither a vaccine nor effective therapies are available to treat infection. To help elucidate the replication mechanism of this RNA virus, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) crystal structure at 3.3 A resolution of a decameric, annular ribonucleoprotein complex of the RSV nucleoprotein (N) bound to RNA. This complex mimics one turn of the viral helical nucleocapsid complex, which serves as template for viral RNA synthesis. The RNA wraps around the protein ring, with seven nucleotides contacting each N subunit, alternating rows of four and three stacked bases that are exposed and buried within a protein groove, respectively. Combined with electron microscopy data, this structure provides a detailed model for the RSV nucleocapsid, in which the bases are accessible for readout by the viral polymerase. Furthermore, the nucleoprotein structure highlights possible key sites for drug targeting.",M2
19961058,"[Viral etiology of acute respiratory infections]Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are pathologies that affect the respiratory tract from the proximal pharynx to the lungs, with an evolution of less than 15 days. They constitute the most frequent cause of morbimortality in the world. With the purpose of identifying the viral agents associated to this type of infections in patients of Zulia State, Venezuela, between February 2005 and July 2006, a total of 102 samples of the respiratory tract (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal washing, spit and bronchoalveolar lavage) were studied. Viral isolation was made through a cellular culture and the identification of the pathogenic agents by the technique of direct immunofluorescence. Forty six positive samples were obtained (45%). The greater incidence was found in the groups of 41 to 64 years old patients, followed by lactanting babies (1 to 23 months). There were no significant differences between sexes. Within the isolated viral pathogens, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (<e>RSV</e>) was the agent most frequently found (32.6% p &lt; 0.05), followed by Adenovirus (28.2%), Parainfluenza (23.9%) and Influenza (15.2%). The respiratory infections of the low respiratory tract were the most frequent (67.4%). A high incidence of associated viral agents to ARI in Zulia State is demonstrated. A high incidence in adult patients and the greatest positivity was found for RSV.",M2
19959800,"Development of a rapid automated influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay and its use during the 2009 H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus epidemic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Rapid, semiautomated, and fully automated multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays were developed and validated for the detection of influenza (Flu) A, Flu B, and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) from nasopharyngeal specimens. The assays can detect human H1N1, H3N2, and swine-origin (S-OIV) H1N1 Flu A viruses and were effectively used to distinguish Flu A infections (of all subtypes) from Flu B and RSV infections during the current S-OIV outbreak in Milwaukee, WI. The analytical limits of detection were 10(-2) to 10(1) TCID(50)/ml depending on the platform and analyte and showed only one minor cross-reaction among 23 common respiratory pathogens (intermittent cross-reaction to adenovirus at &gt;10(7) TCID(50)/ml). A total of 100 clinical samples were tested by tissue culture, both automated assays, and the US Food and Drug Administration-approved ProFlu+ assay. Both the semiautomated and fully automated assays exhibited greater overall (Flu A, Flu B, and RSV combined) clinical sensitivities (93 and 96%, respectively) and individual Flu A sensitivities (100%) than the Food and Drug Administration-approved test (89% overall sensitivity and 93% Flu A sensitivity). All assays were 99% specific. During the S-OIV outbreak in Milwaukee, WI, the fully automated assay was used to test 1232 samples in 2 weeks. Flu A was detected in 134 clinical samples (126 H1N1 S-OIV, 5 H1N1 [human], and 1 untyped) with 100% positive agreement compared with other  in-house  validated molecular assays, with only 2 false-positive results. Such accurate testing using automated high-throughput molecule systems should allow clinicians and public health officials to react quickly and effectively during viral outbreaks.",M2
19956576,"The level and duration of <e>RSV</e>-specific maternal IgG in infants in Kilifi Kenya.BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. The rate of decay of RSV-specific maternal antibodies (RSV-matAb), the factors affecting cord blood levels, and the relationship between these levels and protection from infection are poorly defined. METHODS: A birth cohort (n = 635) in rural Kenya, was studied intensively to monitor infections and describe age-related serological characteristics. RSV specific IgG antibody (Ab) in serum was measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in cord blood, consecutive samples taken 3 monthly, and in paired acute and convalescent samples. A linear regression model was used to calculate the rate of RSV-matAb decline. The effect of risk factors on cord blood titres was investigated. RESULTS: The half-life of matAb in the Kenyan cohort was calculated to be 79 days (95% confidence limits (CL): 76-81 days). Ninety seven percent of infants were born with RSV-matAb. Infants who subsequently experienced an infection in early life had significantly lower cord titres of anti-RSV Ab in comparison to infants who did not have any incident infection in the first 6 months (P = 0.011). RSV infections were shown to have no effect on the rate of decay of RSV-matAb. CONCLUSION: Maternal-specific RSV Ab decline rapidly following birth. However, we provide evidence of protection against severe disease by RSV-matAb during the first 6-7 months. This suggests that boosting maternal-specific Ab by RSV vaccination may be a useful strategy to consider.",M2

However, interpretation is hampered by the difficulty of attributing a causative pathogen. We described the temporal relationship between laboratory counts of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) detection and alternative groupings of Emergency Department (ED) respiratory diagnoses. METHODS: ED and laboratory data were obtained for the south-eastern area of Sydney, NSW for the period 1 June 2001 - 1 December 2006. Counts of ED visits and laboratory confirmed positive RSV and influenza cases were aggregated by week. Semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAM) were used to determine the association between the incidence of RSV and influenza and the incidence of respiratory syndrome ED presentations while controlling for temporal confounders. RESULTS: For every additional RSV laboratory count, ED diagnoses of bronchiolitis increased by 3.1% (95%CI: 2.7%-3.5%) in the same week. For every additional influenza laboratory count, ED diagnoses of influenza-like illness increased by 4.7% (95%CI: 4.2%-5.2%) one week earlier. CONCLUSION: In this study, large increases in ED diagnoses of bronchiolitis and influenza-like illness were independent and proxy indicators for RSV and influenza activity, respectively.",M2
19915054,"IL-9 regulates pathology during primary and memory responses to respiratory syncytial virus infection.IL-9 is a cytokine of great current interest associated with allergic/Th2 responses. High levels of IL-9 are present in bronchial secretions from infants with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) bronchiolitis. To test its effects in RSV disease with a Th2 profile, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the RSV G protein. On RSV challenge, immunized mice developed augmented disease characterized by enhanced pulmonary Th2 and local IL-9 production peaking on days 7-10 of RSV infection. Depletion with anti-IL-9 Ab at vaccination or RSV challenge enhanced viral clearance. Depletion only at challenge had no effect on disease severity, whereas depletion at immunization and challenge enhanced Th1 responses, inhibited virus-specific IgG1 production, and enhanced disease severity. By contrast, depletion of IL-9 at immunization boosted IgG2a and inhibited the Th2 response and disease during subsequent infection without a concomitant increase in type 1 cytokines. Adoptive transfer of secondary memory CD4 T cells from the spleens of IL-9-depleted mice into naive recipients replicated many of the effects of depletion, indicating that IL-9 acts via CD4 T cells. Therefore, IL-9 is a previously unknown but key modulator of antiviral immunity, regulating T and B cell responses and having potent and specific effects on viral lung disease.",M2
19907362,"High incidence of recurrent wheeze in children with down syndrome with and without previous respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection.BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>)-induced lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is associated with the subsequent development of recurrent wheeze. In a recent study, we found a high incidence (9.9%) of hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI among children with Down syndrome (DS), indicating DS as a new risk factor for RSV-induced LRTI. In the current study we aimed to investigate the development of long-term airway morbidity in children with DS after hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI. METHODS: A combined retrospective cohort and prospective birth cohort of children with DS with a history of hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI was studied (n = 53). Three control populations were included: children with DS without hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI (n = 110), children without DS but with hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI (n = 48), and healthy siblings of the previous 3 groups mentioned (n = 49). The primary outcome was physician-diagnosed wheeze up to 2 years of age. RESULTS: The incidence of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheeze in children with DS with a history of hospitalization for RSV-induced LRTI was 36%. Unexpectedly, up to 30% of children with DS without a history of RSV-induced LRTI had physician-diagnosed recurrent wheeze (no significant difference). In children without DS physician-diagnosed wheeze was found more frequently in children hospitalized for RSV-induced LRTI than healthy controls (31% vs. 8%, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this combined retrospective/prospective cohort study RSV-induced LRTI did not significantly contribute to the risk of recurrent wheeze in children with DS. An unexpected finding was that recurrent wheeze was very common among children with DS.",M2
19903147,"Impairment of T cell immunity by the respiratory syncytial virus: targeting virulence mechanisms for therapy and prophylaxis.Worldwide, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (<e>RSV</e>) causes severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals. Moreover, RSV is the mayor cause of infant hospitalization due to lower respiratory infection, regardless socioeconomic status. Accumulating data support the notion that immune responses elicited against naturally acquired RSV infections are non-lasting and inappropriate for efficient virus clearance. Although there is consensus over the capacity of RSV to impair the development of an effective and protective adaptive immune response, very little is known about specific viral determinants involved in these processes as well as the molecular mechanisms developed by this virus to inhibit T cell function. Recent studies have provided evidence supporting an important role for dendritic cells in RSV-induced suppression of immunity. Although recognized for over 50 years as an important respiratory pathogen and healthcare problem, to date there are no available vaccines against this virus, which highlights the complexity of RSV-induced immunopathology. The development of new prophylactic and therapeutic tools against RSV requires the unveiling of molecular mechanisms and virulence factors responsible for the pathogenesis caused by this virus. In this review, we discuss recent findings describing virulence mechanisms evolved by RSV to negatively modulate the adaptive immune response in the host. Furthermore, novel strategies aimed to induce efficient T cell immunity against RSV are reviewed.",M2
19889104,"Cardiac troponin-I as a screening tool for myocarditis in children hospitalized for viral infection.AIM: The incidence of myocarditis in children is uncertain because patients with minor symptoms can remain undiagnosed. We hypothesized that screening all children who are hospitalized for an acute infection with troponin-I (TnI) would reveal myocarditis cases and performed a prospective screening study. METHODS: Between October 2005 and July 2008, a blood sample for TnI measurement was taken every time a sample for C-reactive protein measurement was drawn. If TnI value was above the screening limit (0.06 microg/L), electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac ultrasound were performed. TnI measurements were repeated until at normal level. RESULTS: Altogether, 1009 children were screened during the 33 months. TnI was above the screening limit (0.06 microg/L) in six children. None of them had any signs of myocarditis in ECG or cardiac ultrasound. Five of those six children were younger than 30 days. All had a respiratory infection as a cause for hospitalization, three of which was caused by <e>RSV</e>. In four children, all younger than 30 days, TnI levels remained high (&gt;0.37 microg/L) for two months, but decreased after that to normal levels. CONCLUSION: The incidence of myocarditis during viral infections is low and a routine TnI screening for asymptomatic myocarditis is not useful.",M2
19856469,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection facilitates acute colonization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals and patients ventilated mechanically and is the major pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis, in which it causes chronic infections. Epidemiological, in vitro and animal data suggest a role for respiratory virus infections in facilitating colonization and infection with P. aeruginosa. A study was undertaken to determine whether respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection could facilitate the initiation of an acute infection with P. aeruginosa in vivo. Balb/c mice were infected intranasally with P. aeruginosa, with and without simultaneous inoculation with RSV. Lung function measurements were undertaken using Whole Body Plethysmography and lungs were harvested 24 hr after inoculation. Mice exposed to RSV and P. aeruginosa showed 2,000 times higher colony-forming units (CFU) counts of P. aeruginosa in the lung homogenates when compared to mice which were only infected with P. aeruginosa and lung function changes were more severe in co-infected mice. Control mice receiving RSV alone showed no significant changes in lung function or cytokine production, and no inflammatory changes in the lung parenchyma. These results suggest that RSV can facilitate the initiation of acute P. aeruginosa infection without the RSV infection being clinically apparent. This could have implications for treatment strategies to prevent opportunistic P. aeruginosa lung infection.",M2
19849942,"[Detection of respiratory syncytial virus in children with respiratory tract infections by nucleic acid amplification fluorogenic quantitative assay]OBJECTIVE: Nucleic acid amplification (PCR) fluorogenic quantitative assay is used for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection. This study was designed to explore the sensitivity of PCR fluorogenic quantitative assay for ascertaining respiratory RSV infection and RSV infection conditions by detecting the presence of RSV-RNA related sequences in children. METHODS: Bronchial and nasopharyngeal secretions specimens from 261 hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections from January 2007 to October 2008 were collected. Respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid (RNA) in the specimens was measuredby PCR fluorogenic quantitative assay. Blood RSV-IgM was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sensitivity for ascertaining respiratory RSV infection was compared between the two assays. RESULTS: The RSV-RNA positive rate ascertained by PCR fluorogenic quantitative assay (38.7%) was significantly higher than blood RSV-IgM positive rate (21.1%) (p&lt;0.01). The RSV-RNA positive rate (43.6%) in children at ages of less than 6 months was significantly higher than that in children at ages of 1 to three years (32.1%) (p&lt;0.01). The RSV-RNA positive rate in children with bronchiolitis (58.5%) was the highest, followed by bronchopneumonia (38.2%) and acute bronchitis (20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of PCR fluorogenic quantitative assay for ascertaining respiratory RSV infection is higher. RSV is a major pathogen of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. A higher rate of RSV infection is associated with a younger age. RSV infection is the most common in children with bronchiolitis.",M2
19840769,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection of camels (Camelus dromedaries).This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infections in camels in Sudan. A total of 272 camel lung specimens showing pneumonia were collected from slaughter houses at four different areas in Sudan, additionally 8 specimens were collected from outbreaks of respiratory infection in camels. Using sandwich ELISA kits for RSV antigen detection 4 out of 280 tested lungs (1.4%) were positive, all were from Central Sudan (Tambool slaughter house). FAT was used to confirm the ELISA positives. Polymerase chain reaction RT/PCR was applied for the detection of RSV genome in camel lungs; 1 out of 4 ELISA positives was positive by RT/PCR. Using indirect ELISA kits 135 out of 495 (27.3%) camel sera showed antibodies to RSV, highest prevalence was observed in Western (33.5%) then Central (31.6%) and Eastern Sudan (23.5%). Based on the manufacturer specified calculations for OD readings, most of positive sera (90/135) were low reactive (1+).

19839210,"[Transferability of trial results into clinical practice: examples taken from paediatric practice]Since 2000 there has been sufficient evidence that chest X-rays are unnecessary in infants and children with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection. The reason is that neither the diagnosis nor the first therapeutic decisions will be influenced by the result of this procedure, and especially so if children have been infected with the respiratory syncytial virus. However, epidemiological studies in Germany reveal an ongoing use of chest X-ray in these cases. This might suggest that the X-ray images are taken as  proof  of pneumonia, which indeed pays off in the German DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) system since hospitals receive a higher reimbursement for <e>RSV</e> pneumonia than for RSV bronchiolitis.",M2
19837611,"Low incidence of severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in lung transplant recipients despite the absence of specific therapy.BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infections in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Immunoglobulins, ribavirin, and palivizumab are suggested treatments for both pre-emptive and therapeutic purposes. However, in the absence of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, efficacy is controversial and there is toxicity as well as cost concerns. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult LTRs. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, combined with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. RESULTS: Ten symptomatic patients were identified (7 men and 3 women, age range 28 to 64 years). All were hospitalized for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Two patients had a concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection, and 1 patient had a concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Eight patients did not receive a specific anti-RSV treatment because of clinical stability and/or improvement at the time of RSV diagnosis. Only 2 patients (1 with Grade A3 allograft rejection and 1 requiring mechanical ventilation) received ribavirin and palivizumab. All patients recovered without complications and with no persistent RSV infection. However, bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) staging worsened in 6 patients during the mean follow-up of 45 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mild RSV infections in LTRs might evolve favorably in the absence of specific anti-viral therapy. However, this observation needs confirmation in a large clinical trial specifically investigating the development of BOS in untreated vs treated patients.",M2
19822120,"Progress in the surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) in Europe: 2001-2008.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance is important to get insight into the burden of disease and epidemic pattern of RSV infection. This information is useful for healthcare resource allocation as well as the timing of preventive messages and palivizumab prophylaxis. For influenza surveillance the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) was established in 1996, but no surveillance platform is available for RSV. To improve surveillance an RSV Task Group was established in 2003 and recommendations for RSV surveillance were developed. By 2008, progress was made for four out of six recommendations: the number of European countries testing specimens for RSV increased from six to fourteen; nose and/or throat swabs were generally used for detection of influenza and RSV; a total of 25 laboratories performed molecular testing for diagnosis and participated in a quality control assessment for RSV with an overall good performance; four of the ten countries that joined EISS in 2004 started reporting RSV detections in addition to influenza in the period 2004-8. Limited progress was achieved for standardising methods and the development of a sentinel surveillance system of representative hospitals. Improving RSV surveillance is possible by further harmonising the data collection and increased reporting of RSV.",M2
19804909,"The human neonatal B cell response to respiratory syncytial virus uses a biased antibody variable gene repertoire that lacks somatic mutations.The human Ab repertoire exhibits restrictions during fetal life characterized by biases of variable gene segment usage and lack of junctional diversity. We tested the hypotheses that Ab repertoire restriction persists in the early postnatal period and contributes to the observed poor quality of specific Ab responses made by neonates to viruses and vaccines. We analyzed the molecular determinants of B cell responses in humans to respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>). Analysis of the variable gene segment usage of adult RSV-specific B cells revealed a repertoire profile in these cells similar to that seen in randomly selected B cells, which was V(H)3-dominant. Four gene segments (V(H)3-23, V(H)3-30, V(H)3-33 and V(H)4-04) accounted for almost half of the V(H) genes used. In contrast, very young infant RSV-specific antibodies exhibited a biased repertoire characterized by comparable use of the V(H)1, V(H)3, and V(H)4 families, and less common use of the four immunodominant gene segments. Infants and children older than three months used an antibody repertoire similar to that of adults. Mutational analysis revealed that the antibody variable genes of infants under three months of age also possessed significantly fewer somatic mutations in both framework and complementarity-determining region (CDR) regions than those of adults, even in a child with recurrent RSV infection. These data suggest that neonates use a biased antibody gene repertoire that is less V(H)3-focused and that possesses a dramatically lower frequency of somatic mutations. These biased features of the RSV-specific repertoire likely contribute to the poor functional Ab response in very young infants.",M2
19799934,"Human HepG2 cells support respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus replication.Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human respiratory syncytial (<e>RSV</e>) virus cause mild to severe infections of the respiratory tract in all age groups. So far, several cell lines derived from respiratory tissues have been identified to support replication of both viruses. Unfortunately, titers attained during replication differ between the both viruses within one cell line despite equal infection conditions, on the one hand giving raise to the assumption that the individual susceptibility may vary in dependence of the virus, and, on the other hand, making it difficult to compare results between both viruses. Low titers may cause problems in experiments such as animal trials, in which high titers in low volumes are a prerequisite for successful experiments. The advantages are described of the use of a human cell line (normally used for hepatitis viruses research) susceptible for RSV and hMPV in which both viruses replicate to comparable and high titers. It is also shown that the cell line can also be used for applications such as cell viability tests. Cell viability tests can be used as reciprocal determination tests of viral titers and therefore offer the opportunity to replace classical virological tests such as TCID(50). The cell line can be also used for high throughput applications like drug screening, making it a useful tool for screening for antiviral compound active against RSV and hMPV.",M2
19799014,"[The role of serum leptin in infants with wheezing after respiratory syncytial virus infected]OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of serum leptin in infants with wheezing after respiratory syncytial virus infected. METHODS: 43 infants infected with <e>RSV</e> were given blood samples to detect leptin concentration with radioimmunoassays (RIA) within 24 hours after admission into hospital, discharged and 12 weeks later. Then, they were followed up for 2 years. 10 healthy children of the same age served as controls. RESULTS: 41.9% infants developed asthma after infected with RSV. Compared to control group, the serum level of leptin in the asthma group and non-asthma group were significantly higher before treatment (t = 3.41 and 2.64 respectively, P &lt; 0.05). When they were discharged, the serum level of leptin in the asthma group was significantly higher than that in non-asthma group and control group (t = 5.74 and 6.23, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). 12 weeks later, the serum level of leptin in the asthma group was still significantly higher than that in non-asthma group and control group (t = 6.32 and 6.11, respectively, P &lt; 0.05), but there were no difference between non-asthma group and control group (t = 0.81, P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The serum level of leptin in infants with asthma after RSV infected was higher than that in healthy and non-asthma children. Persistent higher level of leptin may play an important role in infants with asthma after RSV infected.",M2
19795618,"[Investigation of respiratory syncytial virus by three different methods in children with lower respiratory tract infection]Respiratory Syncytial Virus (<e>RSV</e>) is the most important viral agent leading to lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RSV by direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA), cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in children with lower respiratory tract infection. Nasotracheal aspirate specimens collected from 80 hospitalized patients aged between 0-24 months and clinically diagnosed as lower respiratory tract infection, during November 2005-May 2006 period, were included to the study. RSV antigen was investigated in clinical specimens by DFA method (Monofluo Bio-Rad, France). Hep-2 culture was used for isolation of RSV. RSV-RNA was investigated by real-time PCR (Fluorion lontek, Turkey) in clinical specimens. RSV was found positive in 26 (32.5%) of 80 samples by DFA and in 17 (21.3%) samples by cell culture. Six specimens were not studied by PCR as sample amounts were not sufficient. Of the 74 samples tested, 20 (27%) were found to be positive by real-time PCR. Fifty-four of the samples were negative by 3 of the methods, while 12 were positive by all of them. DFA and PCR positive 8 samples yielded negative result in cell culture. Five of the 6 samples not investigated by PCR, were positive both in DFA and cell culture while 1 sample was positive only by DFA. Considering cell culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were found as 100%, 85.7%, 65.4% and 100%, respectively, for DFA and 100%, 94.7%, 85% and 100%, respectively, for PCR. As a conclusion for the accurate diagnosis of RSV infections the clinical samples should be collected in the early phase of the disease and inoculated to the cell cultures immediately for viral isolation. If cell culture or PCR facilities are not available for routine diagnosis, DFA method can be used for rapid and cost effective diagnosis of RSV infections.",M2
19781072,"Systemic T-helper and T-regulatory cell type cytokine responses in rhinovirus vs. respiratory syncytial virus induced early wheezing: an observational study.BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV) associated early wheezing has been recognized as an independent risk factor for asthma. The risk is more important than that associated with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) disease. No comparative data are available on the immune responses of these diseases. OBJECTIVE: To compare T-helper1 (Th1), Th2 and T-regulatory (Treg) cell type cytokine responses between RV and RSV induced early wheezing. METHODS: Systemic Th1-type (interferon [IFN] -gamma, interleukin [IL] -2, IL-12), Th2-type (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and Treg-type (IL-10) cytokine responses were studied from acute and convalescence phase serum samples of sole RV (n = 23) and RSV affected hospitalized wheezing children (n = 27). The pre-defined inclusion criteria were age of 3-35 months and first or second wheezing episode. Analysis was adjusted for baseline differences. Asymptomatic children with comparable demographics (n = 11) served as controls for RV-group. RESULTS: RV-group was older and had more atopic characteristics than RSV-group. At acute phase, RV-group had higher (fold change) IL-13 (39-fold), IL-12 (7.5-fold), IFN-gamma (6.0-fold) and IL-5 (2.8-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (27-fold), IL-2 (8.9-fold), IL-5 (5.6-fold) and IL-10 (2.6-fold) than the controls. 2-3 weeks later, RV-group had higher IFN-gamma (&gt;100-fold), IL-13 (33-fold) and IL-10 (6.5-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (15-fold) and IL-2 (9.4-fold) than the controls. IL-10 levels were higher in acute phase compared to convalescence phase in both infections (p &lt; 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results support a hypothesis that RV is likely to trigger wheezing mainly in children with a predisposition. IL-10 may have important regulatory function in acute viral wheeze.",M2
19776123,"Protective efficacy and immunogenicity of an adenoviral vector vaccine encoding the codon-optimized F protein of respiratory syncytial virus.Adenoviral vectors (AdV) have received considerable attention for vaccine development because of their high immunogenicity and efficacy. In previous studies, it was shown that DNA immunization of mice with codon-optimized expression plasmids encoding the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e> F) resulted in enhanced protection against RSV challenge compared to immunization with plasmids carrying the wild-type cDNA sequence of RSV F. In this study, we constructed AdV carrying the codon-optimized full-length RSV F gene (AdV-F) or the soluble form of the RSV F gene (AdV-Fsol). BALB/c mice were immunized twice with AdV-F or AdV-Fsol and challenged with RSV intranasally. Substantial levels of antibody to RSV F were induced by both AdV vaccines, with peak neutralizing-antibody titers of 1:900. Consistently, the viral loads in lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were significantly reduced by a factor of more than 60,000. The protection against viral challenge could be measured even 8 months after the booster immunization. AdV-F and AdV-Fsol induced similar levels of immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Therefore, these results encourage further development of AdV vaccines against RSV infection in humans.",M2
19759251,"A novel 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor, AM679, reduces inflammation in the respiratory syncytial virus-infected mouse eye.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is an important cause of viral respiratory disease in children, and RSV bronchiolitis has been associated with the development of asthma in childhood. RSV spreads from the eye and nose to the human respiratory tract. Correlative studies of humans and direct infection studies of BALB/c mice have established the eye as a significant pathway of entry of RSV to the lung. At the same time, RSV infection of the eye produces symptoms resembling allergic conjunctivitis. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are known promoters of allergy and inflammation, and the first step in their biogenesis from arachidonic acid is catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in concert with the 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP). We have recently developed a novel compound, AM679, which is a topically applied and potent inhibitor of FLAP. Here we show with the BALB/c mouse eye RSV infection model that AM679 markedly reduced the RSV-driven ocular pathology as well as the synthesis of CysLTs in the eye. In addition, AM679 decreased the production of the Th2 cell cytokine interleukin-4 but did not increase the viral load in the eye or the lung. These results suggest that FLAP inhibitors may be therapeutic for RSV-driven eye disease and possibly other inflammatory eye indications.",M2
19758545,"Stochastic modeling of the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) in the region of Valencia, Spain.In this paper, we study the dynamics of the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the population using stochastic models. The stochastic models are developed introducing stochastic perturbations on the demographic parameter as well as on the transmission rate of the RSV. Numerical simulations of the deterministic and stochastic models are performed in order to understand the effect of fluctuating birth rate and transmission rate of the RSV on the population dynamics. The numerical solutions of stochastic models are calculated using Euler-Maruyama and Milstein schemes, and confidence intervals for stochastic solutions are given using Monte-Carlo method. Analysis of the numerical results reveals that perturbations on the transmission rate are more decisive in the dynamics of RSV than perturbations on demographic parameters. In addition, the stochastic models show the advantage of reproducing more effectively the noisy RSV hospitalization data. It is concluded that these stochastic models are a viable option to provide a realistic modeling of the RSV dynamics on the population.",M2
19747707,"N-terminally truncated C protein, CNDelta25, of human parainfluenza virus type 3 is a potent inhibitor of viral replication.The C protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is a multifunctional accessory protein that inhibits viral transcription and interferon (IFN) signaling. In the present study, we found that removal of N-terminal 25 or 50 amino acid residues from the C protein (CNDelta25 or CNDelta50) totally abolished viral RNA synthesis in the HPIV3 minigenome system. Further N-terminal or C-terminal deletion impaired the inhibitory ability of CNDelta25 and CNDelta50. Subsequent mutagenesis analysis suggested that the N-terminal-charged amino acid residues (K3, K6, K12, E16, and R24) contribute to the higher inhibition caused by CNDelta25 than the C protein. Consistent with viral RNA synthesis inhibition, the growth of HPIV3 was significantly decreased by 5 logs in HeLa-derived cell line expressing CNDelta25. Interestingly, replication of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), another important respiratory tract pathogen, was also strongly inhibited in the presence of CNDelta25. These findings provide a promising potential to use CNDelta25 as an antiviral agent against the clinically important respiratory tract diseases caused by HPIV3 and RSV.",M2
19735540,"Does the viral subtype influence the biennial cycle of respiratory syncytial virus?BACKGROUND: The epidemic pattern of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is quite different in regions of Europe (biennial epidemics in alternating cycles of approximately 9 and 15 months) than in the Western Hemisphere (annual epidemics). In order to determine if these differences are accounted for by the circulation of different RSV subtypes, we studied the prevalence of RSV subtype A and B strains in Zagreb County from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2007. RESULTS: RSV was identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of 368 inpatients using direct fluorescence assays and/or by virus isolation in cell culture. The subtype of recovered strains was determined by real-time PCR. Of 368 RSV infections identified in children during this interval, subtype A virus caused 94 infections, and subtype B 270. Four patients had a dual RSV infection (subtypes A and B). The period of study was characterized by two epidemic waves of RSV infections-one, smaller, in the spring of 2006 (peaking in March), the second, larger, in December 2006/January 2007 (peaking in January). The predominant subtype in both outbreaks was RSV subtype B. Not until November 2007 did RSV subtype A predominate, while initiating a new outbreak continuing into the following calendar year. CONCLUSION: Though only two calendar years were monitored, we believe that the biennial RSV cycle in Croatia occurs independently of the dominant viral subtype.",M2

19713363,"Comparative evaluation of real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR during a 2 year surveillance for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus among children with acute respiratory infections in Kolkata, India, reveals a distinct seasonality of infection.Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) are the predominant aetiological agents during seasonal epidemics, and thus rapid and sensitive molecular tests for screening for such agents and timely identification of epidemics are required. This study compared real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with conventional RT-PCR for parallel identification of influenza A virus (IAV) or influenza B virus (IBV) and RSV. A total of 1091 respiratory samples was examined from children with suspected ARTIs between January 2007 and December 2008. Of these, 275 (25.21 %) were positive for either influenza or RSV by qPCR compared with 262 (24 .01%) positive by RT-PCR. Overall, IAV, IBV and RSV were detected in 121 (11.09 %), 59 (5.41 %) and 95 (8.71 %) samples, respectively. In spite of overlapping clinical symptoms, RSV and influenza virus showed distinct seasonal peaks. IAV correlated positively and RSV negatively with rainfall and temperature. No distinct seasonality was observed in IBV infections. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a systemic surveillance of respiratory viruses with seasonal correlation and prevalence rates from eastern India. This 2 year comparative analysis also confirmed the feasibility of using qPCR in developing countries, which will not only improve the scope for prevention of epidemics, but will also provide crucial epidemiological data from tropical regions.",M2
19705175,"Simultaneous detection of human bocavirus and adenovirus by multiplex real-time PCR in a Belgian paediatric population.Since the discovery of human bocavirus (hBoV), the virus has been detected worldwide in respiratory tract samples from young children by various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and real-time PCRs (Q-PCR). Until now, no data have been reported on the presence of hBoV in Belgium and the detection of hBoV in a multiplex Q-PCR setting has not been described. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reliable multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV DNA and adenovirus (AdV) DNA. During the winter of 2004-2005, 445 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were analysed from 404 Belgian children up to 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). (Co)infections with hBoV, AdV, respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus were investigated. A viral agent was detected in 61% (n = 272/445) of the NPAs. Multiplex Q-PCR found a prevalence of 11% (n = 51/445) hBoV and 13% (n = 58/445) AdV. Coinfections were more frequently found with AdV (62%; n = 36/58) than with hBoV (49%; n = 25/51). Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs. In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month. Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by addressing a broader range of potential respiratory pathogens.",M2
19674262,"Viral etiology of acute respiratory infections among Iranian Hajj pilgrims, 2006.BACKGROUND: Every year more than 2 million pilgrims from different countries in the world including Iran participate in the annual Hajj in Saudi Arabia. Respiratory diseases have been the most common cause of illnesses among Iranian pilgrims. METHODS: Direct fluorescent staining and viral culture were performed on nasal wash specimens of Iranian Hajj pilgrims with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections at Shiraz (a city in southern Iran) airport on return from the Hajj during December 2006 to January 2007. They were screened for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 to 3, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) by viral culture and immunofluorecent staining. Rhinovirus and enterovirus were diagnosed based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: The patients aged between 19 and 82 years (mean: 52.4 years) consisting of 135 females and 120 males. Cough in 213(83.5%) and sore throat in 209 (82%) were the most common symptoms. Eighty-three patients (32.5%) had viral pathogens: influenza in 25 (9.8%), parainfluenza in 19 (7.4%), rhinovirus in 15 (5.9%), adenovirus in14 (5.4%), enterovirus in 5 (2%), and RSV in 4 (1.6%) and coinfection with two viruses in 1 patient (0.4%). Influenza virus was identified more in unvaccinated than in vaccinated pilgrims (16.5% vs. 9.2%) but statistically insignificant (p= 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, each of the above-mentioned viruses played a role in the development of respiratory diseases among Iranian pilgrims, with influenza virus as the commonest one. Because influenza vaccine could not prevent respiratory infections in Hajj pilgrims statistically, the possibility of the appearance of new drift variants not included in vaccine and also inappropriate vaccine handling and storage might be considered. So it is also advisable to check if the circulating influenza strains were different from the vaccine strains.",M2

METHODS: (1) Cell experiment: 32 flasks of human airway epithelial cell 16HBEs were randomly divided into four groups: RSV group, RSV/RIB group, RIB group and control group. 16HBEs were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. RIB 50 microg/ml was added in culture medium and Western blot used to detect the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) protein; (2) Animal experiment: 32 female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: Ovalbumin (OVA) group, OVA/RSV group, OVA/RSV/RIB group and control group. Mice were sensitized by OVA and stimulated with nebulized OVA. RSV was inoculated into murine nasal cavity and RIB 10 mg/kg intramuscularly administered. BUXCO noninvasive murine lung function detection instrument was used to examine the airway response to metacholine; ELISA was used to detect IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IFN-gamma in murine serum and TSLP in supernatants of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); murine lung specimens were stained with HE to observe inflammation and immunohistochemical technique was employed to observe the production of TSLP in murine airway epithelial cells. RESULTS: The cell experiment demonstrated the productions of TSLP protein in RSV group, RSV/RIB group, RIB group and control group were 1.97 +/- 0.22, 1.16 +/- 0.19, 0.99 +/- 0.17 and 0.89 +/- 0.08 respectively, and the production of TSLP in RSV/RIB group was lower than that in RSV group (P &lt; 0.01). The animal experiment demonstrated that the murine airway responsiveness in RSV/OVA/RIB group was lower than that in OVA/RSV group (P &lt; 0.01). The levels of IL-4 [(109.7 +/- 41.9) pg/ml], IL-5 [(220.8 +/- 30.9) pg/ml], IFN-gamma [(13.0 +/- 3.4) pg/ml] in murine serum and TSLP [(1945 +/- 82) pg/ml] in BALF of RSV/OVA/RIB group were significantly lower than those in OVA/RSV group [(274.2 +/- 103.7), (293.3 +/- 46.1), (30.1 +/- 5.7) and (2127 +/- 46) pg/ml respectively, all P &lt; 0.01]; less infiltration of airway inflammatory cells in OVA/RSV/RIB group was observed than that in OVA/RSV group. Immunohistochemical staining of TSLP also showed a lower production of TSLP in airway epithelial cells of OVA/RSV/RIB group than OVA/RSV group. CONCLUSION: Ribavirin can inhibit the elevated production of TSLP after RSV infection and relieve RSV-induced asthma exacerbation in mice.",M2

19665425,"Importance of viral and bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the contribution of both viruses and bacteria in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). OBJECTIVES: This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. RESULTS: Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% <e>RSV</e> and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.",M2
19663691,"Are meteorological parameters associated with acute respiratory tract infections?BACKGROUND: Information on the onset of epidemics of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) is useful in timing preventive strategies (eg, the passive immunization of high-risk infants against respiratory syncytial virus [<e>RSV</e>]). Aiming at better predictions of the seasonal activity of ARI pathogens, we investigated the influence of climate on hospitalizations for ARIs. METHODS: Samples obtained from 3044 children hospitalized with ARIs in Mainz, Germany, were tested for pathogens with a multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from 2001 through 2006. Hospitalizations for ARIs were correlated with meteorological parameters recorded at the University of Mainz. The frequency of hospitalization for RSV infection was predicted on the basis of multiple time series analysis. RESULTS: Influenza A, RSV, and adenovirus were correlated with temperature and rhinovirus to relative humidity. In a time series model that included seasonal and climatic conditions, RSV-associated hospitalizations were predictable. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonality of certain ARI pathogens can be explained by meteorological influences. The model presented herein is a first step toward predicting annual RSV epidemics using weather forecast data.",M2
19651397,"Evolution of prophylaxis: MoAb, siRNA, vaccine, and small molecules.Despite the considerable impact that respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infections have in the health of children and adults, the development of therapeutic interventions has been remarkably slow. In the 1980s, advances in the characterisation of neutralising antibodies against RSV led to the development and clinical application of a polyclonal immunoglobulin preparation with high titres of neutralising antibodies against RSV (RSV IVIG). The next step was the development of neutralising monoclonal antibodies. Only palivizumab demonstrated clinical efficacy and was licensed in 1998 by the US FDA, and subsequently by the different world drug regulatory agencies. Motavizumab (MEDI-524) is a novel recombinant humanised IgG1 mAb derived from palivizumab with enhanced anti-RSV neutralising activity. In recent years, in addition to the anti-RSV antibodies, a number of alternative strategies against RSV are being developed. The most innovative approach is the use of siRNAs (small inhibitory RNAs) with specific anti-RSV activity.",M2
19651392,"Health economics and <e>RSV</e>.An economic analysis was performed in Spain to evaluate the efficiency (cost-effectiveness) of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV infection in premature infants with GA 32-35 and two or more risk factors (RF). The design was a decision tree model using data from the scientific literature and the FLIP I and FLIP II studies IRIS Study Group. The main effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained from both the National Health System (NHS) and societal perspectives. Prophylaxis with palivizumab was found to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 13,849euro/QALY from the NHS perspective, and 4,605euro/QALY from the societal perspective. Palivizumab is a cost-effective therapy as prophylaxis against RSV in infants with GA 32-35 and two or more RF. Its use is efficient from the NHS perspective, since the cost of a QALY, even in the least favourable scenarios, is lower than the threshold of 30,000euro/QALY considered socially acceptable in Europe.",M2

Studies have highlighted various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be significantly associated with respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) hospitalisation, and a candidate gene approach demonstrated that innate immune gene SNPs had the strongest association with bronchiolitis. The impact of 'other' viruses (RSV, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], coronavirus, boca-virus, enterovirus, paraechovirus) has been investigated. In one series only children with RSV infection experienced recurrent wheezing and in another only RSV infection was associated with respiratory complications (hypoxia correlated with prolonged hospitalisation). Others have examined the long-term outcome of viral infection in infancy. The above studies and others published in the last year will be discussed.",M2

In a dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, blinded trial 561 adults &gt; or =65 years of age at five Canadian sites were randomized to one intramuscular injection of either 100, 50 or 25 microg RSV-A-alum vaccine or 100 microg non-adjuvanted RSV-A vaccine, or alum-placebo. All participants were offered inactivated influenza vaccine on day 32. Immunization was well tolerated and reactogenicity was similar between the RSV and influenza vaccines and the alum-placebo. Only the 100 microg non-adjuvanted RSV vaccine achieved the primary immunogenicity outcome of eliciting a &gt; or =4-fold rise in neutralizing antibody (NA) titres against RSV-A in &gt; or =50% of participants at day 32.

19641066,"Rapid semiautomated subtyping of influenza virus species during the 2009 swine origin influenza A H1N1 virus epidemic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (swine origin influenza virus [S-OIV]) emerged and began causing a large outbreak of illness in Milwaukee, WI. Our group at the Midwest Respiratory Virus Program laboratory developed a semiautomated real-time multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay (Seasonal), employing the NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioMérieux, Durham, NC) and a Raider thermocycler (HandyLab Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), that typed influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and subtyped influenza A virus into the currently circulating H1 and H3 subtypes, as well as a similar assay that identified H1 of S-OIV. The Seasonal and H1 S-OIV assays demonstrated analytical limits of detection of &lt;50 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml and 3 to 30 input copies, respectively. Testing of the analytical specificities revealed no cross-reactivity with 41 and 26 different common organisms and demonstrated outstanding reproducibility of results. Clinical testing showed 95% sensitivity for influenza A virus and influenza B virus and 95 and 97% specificity compared to tissue culture. Comparisons of results from other molecular tests showed levels of positive agreement with the Seasonal and H1 S-OIV assay results of 99 and 100% and levels of negative agreement of 98 and 100%. This study has demonstrated the use of a semiautomated system for sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV and subtyping of influenza A virus into human H1 and H3 and S-OIV strains. This assay/system performed well in clinical testing of regular seasonal influenza virus subtypes and was outstanding during the 2009 Milwaukee S-OIV infection outbreak. This recent outbreak of infection with a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus also demonstrates the importance of quickly distributing information on new agents and of having rapid influenza virus subtyping assays widely available for clinical and public health decisions.",M2
19625398,"Respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural proteins decrease levels of multiple members of the cellular interferon pathways.Viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), suppress cellular innate immunity represented by type I interferon (IFN) for optimal growth in their hosts. The two unique nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1 and NS2, of RSV suppress IFN synthesis, as well as IFN function, but their exact targets are still uncharacterized. Here, we investigate if either or both of the NS proteins affect the steady-state levels of key members of the IFN pathway. We found that both NS1 and NS2 decreased the levels of TRAF3, a strategic integrator of multiple IFN-inducing signals, although NS1 was more efficient. Only NS1 reduced IKKepsilon, a key protein kinase that specifically phosphorylates and activates IFN regulatory factor 3. Loss of the TRAF3 and IKKepsilon proteins appeared to involve a nonproteasomal mechanism. Interestingly, NS2 modestly increased IKKepsilon levels. In the IFN response pathway, NS2 decreased the levels of STAT2, the essential transcription factor for IFN-inducible antiviral genes. Preliminary mapping revealed that the C-terminal 10 residues of NS1 were essential for reducing IKKepsilon levels and the C-terminal 10 residues of NS2 were essential for increasing and reducing IKKepsilon and STAT2, respectively. In contrast, deletion of up to 20 residues of the C termini of NS1 and NS2 did not diminish their TRAF3-reducing activity. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that NS1 and NS2 form a heterodimer. Clearly, the NS proteins of RSV, working individually and together, regulate key signaling molecules of both the IFN activation and response pathways.",M2
19623785,"Identification of influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus during rhinopharyngitis in a group of Mexican children with asthma and wheezing.BACKGROUND: Viral infections can promote allergic sensitization in genetically susceptible individuals. Besides, they are the main cause of wheezing in children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency with which influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) cause rhinopharyngitis in patients with asthma and wheezing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Longitudinal, prospective study in which 168 patients with asthma and wheezing, who attended the outpatient allergy clinic of the National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico, during the spring (from April through June), with clinical signs and symptoms of rhinopharyngitis were included. Samples of nasal secretions were taken with a long swab, and identification of RSV, adenovirus, infuenza A and B and parainfluenzae 1, 2 and 3 by means of direct immunofluorescence (DI) was carried out. RESULTS: Samples of nasal secretions were taken in 100 children with asthma and 68 with wheezing, aged 2-17 years. Viral identification was positive in 75% and 44.1% of the patients, respectively. By age group, RSV predominated among children in preschool age; and influenza A among children in school age and adolescents. Influenza A, adenovirus and parinfluenza 3 were identified more frequently in asthmatic children, whereas influenza A and RSV in patients with wheezing. Coinfection of two viruses was found in 17.1% of all patients with positive DI; the most frequent association was parainfluenza 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: Viral identification by means of DI is a fast and non-invasive technique that could favor the early beginning of antiviral treatments in children with asthma and wheezing.",M2

19604126,"Predictive value of the respiratory syncytial virus risk-scoring tool in the term infant in Canada.BACKGROUND: Palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection has been widely adopted for high-risk infants during the RSV season, based on country-specific guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a validated, risk-scoring tool (RST), can be applied to term, RSV-positive infants seen in the emergency room (ER) to predict need for hospitalization, in order to target prophylaxis cost effectively at a selected group of children. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING: McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 72, consecutive, term, RSV-positive cases were identified retrospectively, from November through April during the 2006-2007 RSV season. METHODS: A questionnaire/chart review was conducted on 68 of 72 cases, to determine risk categories based on the RST. Four, trained abstractors, extracted pertinent data from the medical records of RSV-positive patients. Means, standard deviations (SD), and percents were used to describe the study variables for hospitalized and ER patients discharged home. Chi-square tests were used to compare infants' risk factors to hospitalization. ANOVA was used for comparisons within and between risk groups and RST scores. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The majority of infants scored in the low-risk category (n = 44), versus moderate (n = 16) or high risk (n = 8). Within the low-risk category, 27 (61%) of children were admitted to hospital compared to 17 (39%) who were treated in the ER and discharged home. The mean RST scores for those admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit/ward, the ward only, or those discharged home from the ER were 48.3 (n = 10), 41.0 (n = 36), and 36.5 (n = 22), respectively (p = 0.17). The mean number of risk factors for those discharged home versus hospitalized patients was 2.5 (1.3) and 2.97 (1.13), respectively (p = 0.15). Only two of eight cases in the high-risk group required intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the risk-scoring tool did not discriminate between low versus moderate- to high-risk RSV-positive term infants who require hospitalization which has cost implications, since universal prophylaxis of this cohort would be financially prohibitive. A larger study is necessary to establish risk factors that more accurately determine RSV hospitalization among term infants.",M2
19596574,"Respiratory syncytial virus fusion inhibitors. Part 7: structure-activity relationships associated with a series of isatin oximes that demonstrate antiviral activity in vivo.A series of bezimidazole-isatin oximes were prepared and profiled as inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) replication in cell culture. Structure-activity relationship studies were directed toward optimization of antiviral activity, cell permeability and metabolic stability in human liver micorosomes (HLM). Parallel combinatorial synthetic chemistry was employed to functionalize isatin oximes via O-alkylation which quickly identified a subset of small, lipophilic substituents that established good potency for the series. Further optimization of the isatin oxime derivatives focused on introduction of nitrogen atoms to the isatin phenyl ring to provide a series of aza-isatin oximes with significantly improved PK properties. Several aza-isatin oximes analogs displayed targeted metabolic stability in HLM and permeability across a confluent monolayer of CaCo-2 cells. These studies identified several compounds, including 18i, 18j and 18n that demonstrated antiviral activity in the BALB/c mouse model of RSV infection following oral dosing.",M2
19595407,"<e>RSV</e> replication is attenuated by counteracting expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) molecules.Human RSV causes an annual epidemic of respiratory tract illness in infants and in elderly. Mechanisms by which RSV antagonizes IFN-mediated antiviral responses include inhibition of type I IFN mRNA transcription and blocking signal transduction of JAK/STAT family members. The suppressor of cytokines signaling (SOCS) gene family utilizes a feedback loop to inhibit cytokine responses and block the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. To evaluate the potential of SOCS molecules to subvert the innate immune response to RSV infection, eight SOCS family genes were examined. RSV infection up-regulated SOCS1, SOCS3, and CIS mRNA expression in HEp-2 cells. Suppression of SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS by short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) inhibited viral replication. Furthermore, inhibition of SOCS1, SOCS3, or CIS activated type I IFN signaling by inducing STAT1/2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that RSV infection escapes the innate antiviral response by inducing SOCS1, SOCS3 or CIS expression in epithelial cells.",M2
19548075,"RS virus-induced inflammation and the intracellular glutathione redox state in cultured human airway epithelial cells.There is ample evidence that asthma is mediated by oxidative stress and that viral infection, which is associated with asthma onset and exacerbation in infants, acts as one type of oxidative stress. The goal of this study was to determine whether respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) induces oxidative stress in cultured A549 human airway epithelial cells and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), and whether such RSV-induced oxidative stress can induce airway inflammation. To evaluate the direct effect of RSV infection as an oxidative stressor, the intracellular levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) or oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured. Their ratio (GSH/GSSG) was calculated to indicate intracellular oxidation-reduction (redox) status in A549 and NHBE. To evaluate the extent to which glutathione redox regulation affected cytokine/chemokine production, the effect of pretreatment with a reductive agent, glutathione monoethyl ester (GSH-OEt) and RSV-specific monoclonal antibody was thus studied. RSV acted as a potent oxidative stressor on the intracellular glutathione redox state in human airway epithelial cells, activating signals to increase the production of cytokine/chemokine. Pretreatment with GSH-OEt significantly suppressed RSV-induced time-dependent changes in the intracellular redox state, and also suppressed RSV-induced up-regulation of epithelial cell-derived IL-8, IL-6 and eotaxin production, as well as RSV-specific monoclonal antibody. RSV-induced oxidative stress is likely to contribute to the perpetuation and amplification of the inflammatory response. Therapeutic intervention against oxidative stress might therefore be beneficial as adjunctive therapies for respiratory disorders that are caused by an RSV infection.",M2
19546003,"Use of anionic polymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride)-coated beads for capture of respiratory syncytial virus.Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) is the single most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children, and a major public health concern in pediatrics. However, current diagnostic methods for RSV are not sufficiently sensitive. In addition, there is no simple method for enhancing RSV detection. Here, a method for capturing RSV from nasal fluid has been developed using magnetic beads coated with an anionic polymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydrate). The beads were incubated with RSV-infected nasal fluid, then separated from the supernatant by applying a magnet field and washed. The absorption of RSV by the beads was confirmed by immunochromatography, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which indicated the presence of nucleocapsid protein, fusion protein, and the viral genome of RSV on the incubated beads. Therefore, this capture method will contribute to the improvement of RSV detection.",M2
19545210,"Therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment targeting respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) G protein mediates viral clearance and reduces the pathogenesis of RSV infection in BALB/c mice.Because the G protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has a CX3C chemokine motif that has been associated with the ability of RSV G protein to modulate the virus-induced host immune response, we examined whether therapeutic treatment with an anti-RSV G monoclonal antibody (mAb), 131-2G, that blocks the CX3C-associated activity of RSV G protein might decrease the pulmonary inflammation associated with infection in BALB/c mice. The results show that treatment with mAb 131-2G on day 3 after RSV infection reduces both inflammation and RSV titer in the lungs. Later administration of anti-RSV G mAb (day 5 after RSV infection) effectively reduced the viral titer but had a minimal effect on pulmonary inflammation. This study suggests that an anti-RSV G mAb might be an effective antiviral, either alone or in combination with anti-RSV F protein neutralizing antibodies, for decreasing the virus-induced host response to infection and improve treatment outcome.",M2

19540885,"<e>RSV</e> fusion (F) protein DNA vaccine provides partial protection against viral infection.The present study was conducted to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a RSV F DNA vaccine incorporated with a mucosal adjuvant. Two DNA vaccine vectors (DRF-412 and DRF-412-P) were developed containing residues 412-524 of the RSV F gene. These antigenic regions were cloned into the phCMV1 DNA vaccine vector. One of the DNA vaccine vectors, DRF-412, contained the ctxA(2)B region of the cholera toxin gene as a mucosal adjuvant. The in vitro expressions of these DNA vectors were confirmed in Cos-7 cells by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. In vivo expression of the cloned gene was further confirmed in mouse muscle tissue by immunohistological analysis. The active transcription of the RSV F gene in mouse muscle cells was confirmed by RT-PCR. The purified DRF-412 and DRF-412-P DNA vectors were used to immunize mice by intramuscular injections. Our results indicated that DRF-412 and DRF-412-P vaccine vectors were as effective as live RSV in inducing neutralization antibody, systemic Ab (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b) responses, and mucosal antibody responses (Ig A). The Th1 (TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-10, IL-6) cytokine profiles were analyzed after stimulation of spleen cells from mice immunized with purified RF-412 protein. We observed that mice inoculated with vector DRF-412 induced a higher mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine immune response than DRF-412-P. Reverse transcriptase and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that mice immunized with the DRF-412 vector contained less viral RNA in lung tissue and the lung immunohistology study confirmed that mice immunized with DRF-412 had better protection than those immunized with the DRF-412-P vector. These results indicate that the RSV DRF-412 vaccine vector, which contains the cholera toxin subunit ctxA2B as a mucosal adjuvant may provide a better DNA vaccination strategy against RSV.",M2

19507066,"Secondary RNA structure and its role in RNA interference to silence the respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein gene.RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional, gene silencing mechanism which uses small interfering RNA molecules (siRNA) for gene silencing. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (<e>RSV</e>) is an important respiratory pathogen of medical significance that causes high mortality in infants. The fusion (F) protein of RSV is a good target for therapeutic purposes as it is primarily responsible for penetration of the virus into host cells and subsequent syncytium formation during infection. In the present study, four siRNAs were designed and used individually as well as a mixture, to silence the RSV F gene. The relationship between siRNA design, target RNA structure, and their thermodynamics was also investigated. Silencing of F gene was observed using indirect immunofluorescence, western blot, reverse transcription PCR, and progeny viral titers. Our results show F gene silencing by all the four siRNAs individually and collectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed a decrease in mRNA level which corresponded to decreased F protein expression. siRNAs also inhibited RSV progeny as shown by viral titer estimation on infected HEp-2 cells. The present study demonstrates the silencing of the F gene using siRNA. Thermodynamic characteristics of the target RSV mRNA and siRNA seem to play an important role in siRNA gene silencing efficiency.",M2
19502390,"Respiratory syncytial virus impairs macrophage IFN-alpha/beta- and IFN-gamma-stimulated transcription by distinct mechanisms.Macrophages are the primary lung phagocyte and are instrumental in maintenance of a sterile, noninflamed microenvironment. IFNs are produced in response to bacterial and viral infection, and activate the macrophage to efficiently counteract and remove pathogenic invaders. Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) inhibits IFN-mediated signaling mechanisms in epithelial cells; however, the effects on IFN signaling in the macrophage are currently unknown. We investigated the effect of RSV infection on IFN-mediated signaling in macrophages. RSV infection inhibited IFN-beta- and IFN-gamma-activated transcriptional mechanisms in primary alveolar macrophages and macrophage cell lines, including the transactivation of important Nod-like receptor family genes, Nod1 and class II transactivator. RSV inhibited IFN-beta- and IFN-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation by two distinct mechanisms. RSV impaired IFN-beta-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 phosphorylation through a mechanism that involves inhibition of tyrosine kinase 2 phosphorylation. In contrast, RSV-impaired transcriptional activation after IFN-gamma stimulation resulted from a reduction in the nuclear STAT1 interaction with the transcriptional coactivator, CBP, and was correlated with increased phosphorylation of STAT1beta, a dominant-negative STAT1 splice variant, in response to IFN-gamma. In support of this concept, overexpression of STAT1beta was sufficient to repress the IFN-gamma-mediated expression of class II transactivator. These results demonstrate that RSV inhibits IFN-mediated transcriptional activation in macrophages, and suggests that paramyxoviruses modulate an important regulatory mechanism that is critical in linking innate and adaptive immune mechanisms after infection.",M2
19500108,"Respiratory syncytial virus-induced dysregulation of expression of a mucosal beta-defensin augments colonization of the upper airway by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.Otitis media (OM) is a polymicrobial disease wherein upper respiratory tract viruses compromise host airway defences, which allows bacterial flora of the nasopharynx (NP) access to the middle ear. We have shown, in vitro, that respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>), a viral co-pathogen of OM, reduces transcript abundance of the antimicrobial peptide (AP), chinchilla beta-defensin-1 (cBD-1). Here, we demonstrated that chinchillas inoculated with RSV expressed approximately 40% less cBD-1 mRNA and protein than did mock-challenged animals. Further, concurrent RSV infection resulted in a 10-100-fold greater recovery of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) from nasopharyngeal lavage fluids, compared with chinchillas challenged with NTHI in the absence of viral co-infection. Additionally, when either: anti-cBD-1 antibody (to bind secreted AP) or recombinant cBD-1 (to increase AP concentration at the mucosal surface) were delivered to chinchillas, we demonstrated that disruption of the availability of a single AP influenced the relative load of NTHI in the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, our data suggested that effectors of innate immunity regulate normal bacterial colonization of the NP and, further, virus-induced altered expression of APs can result in an increased load of NTHI within the NP, which likely promotes development of OM.",M2

19482481,"Antiviral and cytotoxic activities of aminoarylazo compounds and aryltriazene derivatives.Twelve aminoarylazocompounds (A-C) and 46 aryltriazene 7 derivatives (D-G) have been synthesized and evaluated in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against a panel of 10 RNA and DNA viruses. Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and <e>RSV</e>. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1&gt;7&gt;8&gt;4; YFV: 7&gt;5; CVB-2: 25&gt;56&gt;18; RSV: 14&gt;20&gt;55&gt;38&gt;18&gt;19; HSV-1: 2. For these compounds the EC(50) ranged from 1.6 microM (1) to 12 microM (18), and the S. I. from 19.4 (1) to 4.2 (2). Thus the aminoarylazo and aryltriazene substructures appear as interesting molecular component for developing antiviral agents against ss RNA viruses, particularly against RSV and BVDV, which are important human and veterinary pathogens. Finally, molecular modeling investigations indicated that compounds of structure A-C, active against BVDV, could work targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), having been observed a good agreement between the trends of the estimated IC(50) and the experimental EC(50) values.",M2
19461555,"Comparison of the cost of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus disease versus palivizumab prophylaxis in Canadian Inuit infants.BACKGROUND: The objectives were to compare actual respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) hospitalization rates and costs in a cohort of Inuit infants to hypothetical palivizumab prophylaxis strategies for infants of all gestational ages in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. METHODS: Incidence and costs of RSV hospitalization were collected for infants admitted to the Baffin Regional Hospital in 2002, before the initiation of palivizumab. There was a comparison of the actual costs to the costs associated with 8 palivizumab strategies stratified by age (&lt;6 months, &lt;1 year) and location (overall, town [Iqaluit], rural communities). It was assumed that each category would receive universal palivizumab prophylaxis resulting in a 78% decrease in RSV admissions. The net costs incurred, number needed to treat (NNT), and incremental costs per hospitalization avoided were calculated for each comparison. RESULTS: There was a great variation in the rates and costs associated with RSV admissions between Iqaluit and the communities. For infants &lt;1 year of age residing in Iqaluit, the mean admission cost was $3915, and palivizumab prophylaxis had an NNT of 20.4 and cost of $162,551 per admission avoided. For rural infants &lt;6 months, the mean cost of admission was $23,030, and palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in an NNT of 3.9 to 2.5 and cost savings of up to $8118 per admission avoided. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high rates and costs associated with RSV admissions, administration of palivizumab in rural communities in the Canadian Arctic to infants less than 6 months of age could result in net cost savings.",M2
19453465,"Human coronavirus NL63 infections in infants hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections in South Africa.BACKGROUND: Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a novel respiratory virus which is associated with respiratory tract infections in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of HCoV-NL63 in infants and young children hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were collected from 1055 infants and young children hospitalised with ARI in 2003-2004. Samples were screened by RT-PCR to detect HCoV-NL63 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Standard shell vial culture and immunofluoresence was used to detect the common respiratory viruses including <e>RSV</e>, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, adenovirus and CMV. RESULTS: A respiratory virus was found in 401/1055 (38.0%) samples. HCoV-NL63 was detected in 9/1055 (0.85%) with peak activity during autumn (67%). Most patients had a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (6/9; 67%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of HCoV-NL63 infections in hospitalised children in Africa. During the 2-year period HCoV-NL63 played a minor role in ARI in children.",M2
19453422,"Human bocavirus infection in hospitalized children in Italy.BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first discovered in Sweden in 2005 and has now been found worldwide; however its role in clinically relevant diseases has not yet been clearly defined. OBJECTIVES: To gain new insight into HBoV infection among children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections in Rome. METHODS: Between November 2004 and May 2007, 415 nasal washings were tested for the presence of an extensive range of respiratory viruses using molecular methods. RESULTS: Viral pathogens were detected in 214 children (51.6%), 28.9% being respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) and 9.6% being rhinovirus positive. Of the 34 children (8.2%) who tested positive for HBoV, 21 (61.8%) were co-infected with another respiratory virus, mainly RSV. Human bocavirus was the only pathogen identified in four pneumonia and six bronchiolitis cases in March 2005 and January 2007, respectively. Human bocavirus was also detected in one child hospitalized with gastroenteritis and in another with erythema. CONCLUSIONS: In the examined population, HBoV was the third most common virus detected but with a high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Human bocavirus appeared to be the etiological agent in some pneumonia and bronchiolitis cases in which tests for all likely respiratory pathogens were negative.",M2
19453286,"Emerging drugs for respiratory syncytial virus infection.Although respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) was discovered &gt; 40 years ago, treatment remains largely supportive. There are no safe and effective vaccines or specific treatments other than prophylaxis with passive antibody therapy (palivizumab). However, there are good reasons to think that the scene may soon change. As the pace of development of anti-viral drugs accelerates and optimism over vaccines increases, novel therapies are set to make a major impact in the management of this very common infection. The use and effect of such interventions are not easy to anticipate, but could ultimately include the interruption of RSV's transmission resulting in profound changes to the impact of RSV on human health.",M2

All synthesized compounds were tested against a wide panel of viruses, since previous work showed that Mannich bases on 7-hydroxycoumarin 1 and unsymmetrical methylene derivatives 2 were endowed with some antiviral activities. The symmetrical Mannich bases 4 were completely inactive, whereas the unsymmetrical methylene derivatives 5, although possessing a certain degree of toxicity, showed a significant activity against <e>RSV</e>. Some of compounds 5 showed a moderate antiviral activity against HIV-1, BVDV, YFV and CVB-2. The lack of activity of Mannich bases 4 demonstrates the crucial importance for antiviral activity of coumarin moiety present in Mannich bases 1.",M2
19445181,"Upregulation of TLR7 and TLR3 gene expression in the lung of respiratory syncytial virus infected mice.OBJECTIVE: TLR7 and TLR3 (Toll-like receptor, TLR) are important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize the single-strand RNA and double-strand RNA of virus-origin. Respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) could be recognized by both TLR7 and TLR3. We studied the kinetics and profile of lung TLR7 and TLR3 expression during the early phase of the RSV infection, and explored their expression correlation with pulmonary inflammatory response. METHODS: We intranasally inoculated BALB/c mice with live RSV to induce acute lung inflammation,and detected the lung expression of TLR7 and TLR3 mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis at day 1 after RSV infection. We also measured the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) protein expression with western blot assay in nuclear extracts. Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined under a light microscope for histopathological examination. RESULTS: SV infection could rapidly upregulate the lung expression levels of both TLR7 and TLR3 gene in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the response of TLR7 to RSV (1 h) was prior to that of TLR3 (4 h). It resulted in activation of NF-kappaB as soon as 4 h later in lung tissue. Moreover, RSV mediated early transcriptional responses of TLR7 and TLR3 were paralleling with the severe extent of RSV-induced pulmonary inflammation. CONCLUSION: TLR7 and TLR3 were really involved in RSV-induced lung inflammation by detecting the viral RNA. This may allow to detect viral infections and initiate a proinflammatory response via multiple TLRs. This study may be useful in the development of tools to modulate the activities of therapeutic TLR ligands.",M2
19444304,"Anticancer oncolytic activity of respiratory syncytial virus.Oncolytic virotherapy is an emerging biotherapeutic platform for cancer treatment, which is based on selective infection/killing of cancer cells by viruses. Herein we identify the human respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) as an oncolytic virus. Using prostate cancer models, we show dramatic enhancement of RSV infectivity in vitro in the androgen-independent, highly metastatic PC-3 human prostate cancer cells compared to the non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 human prostate cells. The oncolytic efficiency of RSV was established in vivo using human prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice. Intratumoral and intraperitoneal injections of RSV led to a significant regression of prostate tumors. Furthermore, enhanced viral burden in PC-3 cells led to selective destruction of PC-3 cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo due to apoptosis triggered by the downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity (and the resulting loss of anti-apoptotic function of NF-kappaB) in RSV-infected PC-3 cells. The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway constitutes the major apoptotic pathway; however, the death-receptor-dependent extrinsic pathway, mediated by the paracrine/autocrine action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced from infected cells, also partly contributed to apoptosis. Thus, the oncolytic property of RSV can potentially be exploited to develop targeted therapeutics for the clinical management of prostate tumors.",M2
19428918,"TLR9 agonist, but not TLR7/8, functions as an adjuvant to diminish FI-<e>RSV</e> vaccine-enhanced disease, while either agonist used as therapy during primary RSV infection increases disease severity.Agonists for TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have been shown to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We evaluated the impact of TLR activation on RSV disease in a murine model by administering TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists during FI-RSV immunization or RSV infection. CpG administered during immunization reduced disease following challenge as evidenced by decreased lung pathology, illness, and cytokines. In marked contrast, TLR7/8 agonist had little impact. To evaluate potential therapeutic use, TLR agonists were administered during primary infection. Although type 2 cytokine responses decreased and type 1 cytokines and MIP-1-alpha/beta increased, both TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists increased clinical symptoms and pulmonary inflammation when administered during primary infection. Thus, TLR9-induced signaling during FI-RSV immunization reduced vaccine-enhanced disease whereas immunostimulatory properties of TLR agonists enhanced disease severity when used during RSV infection. Immunomodulation elicited by TLR9 agonist confirms the adjuvant potential of TLR agonists during RSV immunization. However, in contrast to work done with HIV-1 vaccines, the inability of TLR7/8 agonist to boost type 1 vaccine-induced RSV immunity demonstrates pathogen-TLR specificity. These data reveal that the timing of administration of immunomodulatory agents is critical. Furthermore, these data underscore that amplification of anti-viral immune responses may result in immunopathology rather than immune-mediated protection.",M2
19420085,"Respiratory syncytial virus-induced activation and migration of respiratory dendritic cells and subsequent antigen presentation in the lung-draining lymph node.In the respiratory tract, different dendritic cell (DC) populations guard a tight balance between tolerance and immunity to infectious or harmless materials to which the airways are continuously exposed. For infectious and noninfectious antigens administered via different routes, different subsets of DC might contribute during the induction of T-cell tolerance and immunity. We studied the impact of primary respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) infection on respiratory DC composition in C57BL/6 mice. We also tracked the migration of respiratory DC to the lymph nodes and studied antigen presentation by lung-derived and lymph node-resident DC to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. We observed a massive influx of mainly CD103(-) CD11b(high) CD11c(+) conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC during the first 7 days of RSV infection, while CD103(+) CD11b(low) CD11c(+) cDC disappeared from the lung. The two major subsets of lung tissue DC, CD103(+) CD11b(low) CD11c(+) and CD103(-) CD11b(high) CD11c(+) cDC, both transported RSV RNA to the lung-draining lymph node. Furthermore, these lung-derived cDC subsets as well as resident LN DC, which did not contain viral RNA, displayed viral antigen by major histocompatibility complex class I and class II to CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, our data indicate that during RSV infections, at least three DC subsets might be involved during the activation of lymph node-homing naïve and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.",M2
19419530,"Breastfeeding reduces the severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection among young infants: a multi-center prospective study.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of breastfeeding on the severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection in early infancy. METHODS: A rapid test for respiratory syncytial virus (<e>RSV</e>) was administered by 16 general pediatricians from May 2002 to April 2005 in infants undergoing medical checkups for the common cold, all of whom were 100 days old or younger and had birthweights of more than 2500 g without underlying disease. Infants were divided into three groups: the Full breastfeeding group, the Partial group, and the Token group. RSV-positive cases were followed up for 10 days after the initial diagnosis and the following three points were investigated: (i) the incidence of hospitalization; (ii) the duration of hospitalization; and (iii) the incidence of requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: RSV antigen was detected in 203 of the total of 892 cases, and these were diagnosed as cases of RSV infectious disease. Although there were no significant differences in the hospitalization rate among the three groups, there were significant differences in the duration of hospitalization and the rate of requiring oxygen therapy. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the requirement of oxygen therapy was significantly lower in the Full breastfeeding group (P= 0.032; odds ratio, 0.256; 95% confidence interval, 0.074-0.892). CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding reduces the severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection in early infancy.",M2
19412586,"Prospective population-based study of <e>RSV</e>-related intermediate care and intensive care unit admissions in Switzerland over a 4-year period (2001-2005).OBJECTIVES: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are a leading cause of hospital admissions in small children. A substantial proportion of these patients require medical and nursing care, which can only be provided in intermediate (IMC) or intensive care units (ICU). This article reports on all children aged &lt; 3 years who required admission to IMC and/or ICU between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2005 in Switzerland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data on all children aged &lt; 3 years who were admitted to an IMC or ICU for an RSV-related illness. Using a detailed questionnaire, we collected information on risk factors, therapy requirements, length of stay in the IMC/ICU and hospital, and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 577 cases reported during the study period, 90 were excluded because the patients did not fulfill the inclusion criteria; data were incomplete in another 25 cases (5%). Therefore, a total of 462 verified cases were eligible for analysis. At the time of hospital admission, only 31 patients (11%) were older than 12 months. Since RSV infection was not the main reason for IMC/ICU admission in 52% of these patients, we chose to exclude this subgroup from further analyses. Among the 431 infants aged &lt; 12 months, the majority (77%) were former near term or full term (NT/FT) infants with a gestational age &gt; or = 35 weeks without additional risk factors who were hospitalized at a median age of 1.5 months. Gestational age (GA) &lt; 32 weeks, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and congenital heart disease (CHD) were all associated with a significant risk increase for IMC/ICU admission (relative risk 14, 56, and 10, for GA &lt; or = 32 weeks, BPD, and CHD, respectively). Compared with NT/FT infants, high-risk infants were hospitalized at an older age (except for infants with CHD), required more invasive and longer respiratory support, and had longer stays in the IMC/ICU and hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, RSV infections lead to the IMC/ICU admission of approximately 1%-2% of each annual birth cohort. Although prematurity, BPD, and CHD are significant risk factors, non-pharmacological preventive strategies should not be restricted to these high-risk patients but also target young NT/FT infants since they constitute 77% of infants requiring IMC/ICU admission.",M2
19405961,"Extracellular Hsp72, an endogenous DAMP, is released by virally infected airway epithelial cells and activates neutrophils via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4.BACKGROUND: Neutrophils play an important role in the pathophysiology of <e>RSV</e>, though RSV does not appear to directly activate neutrophils in the lower airways. Therefore locally produced cytokines or other molecules released by virally-infected airway epithelial cells are likely responsible for recruiting and activating neutrophils. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are generally regarded as intracellular proteins acting as molecular chaperones; however, HSP72 can also be released from cells, and the implications of this release are not fully understood. METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were infected with RSV and Hsp72 levels were measured by Western blot and ELISA. Tracheal aspirates were obtained from critically ill children infected with RSV and analyzed for Hsp72 levels by ELISA. Primary human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells were cultured with Hsp72 and supernatants analyzed for cytokine production. In some cases, cells were pretreated with polymyxin B prior to treatment with Hsp72. IkappaBalpha was assessed by Western blot and EMSA's were performed to determine NF-kappaB activation. HL-60 cells were pretreated with neutralizing antibody against TLR4 prior to Hsp72 treatment. Neutrophils were harvested from the bone marrow of wild type or TLR4-deficient mice prior to treatment with Hsp72. RESULTS: Infection of 16HBE14o- with RSV showed an induction of intracellular Hsp72 levels as well as extracellular release of Hsp72. Primary human neutrophils from normal donors and differentiated HL-60 cells treated with increasing concentrations of Hsp72 resulted in increased cytokine (IL-8 and TNFalpha) production. This effect was independent of the low levels of endotoxin in the Hsp72 preparation. Hsp72 mediated cytokine production via activation of NF-kappaB translocation and DNA binding. Using bone marrow-derived neutrophils from wild type and TLR4-mutant mice, we showed that Hsp72 directly activates neutrophil-derived cytokine production via the activation of TLR4. CONCLUSION: Collectively these data suggest that extracellular Hsp72 is released from virally infected airway epithelial cells resulting in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils.",M2
