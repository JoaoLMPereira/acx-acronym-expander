20054847,"Genetic variants in the noncoding region of RPS19 gene in Diamond-Blackfan anemia: potential implications for phenotypic heterogeneity.Mutations in the RPS19 gene have been identified in 25% of individuals affected by Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital erythroblastopenia characterized by an aregenerative anemia and a variety of malformations. More than 60 mutations in the five coding exons of RPS19 have been described to date. We previously reported a mutation (c.-1 + 26G&gt;T) and an insertion at -631 upstream of ATG (c.-147_-146insGCCA) in the noncoding region. Because DBA phenotype is extremely heterogeneous from silent to severe and because haploinsufficiency seems to play a role in this process, it is likely that genetic variations in the noncoding regions affecting translation of RPS19 can modulate the phenotypic expression of DBA. However, to date, very few studies have addressed this question comprehensively. In this study, we performed detailed sequence analysis of the RPS19 gene in 239 patients with DBA and 110 of their relatives. We found that 6.2% of the patients with DBA carried allelic variations upstream of ATG: 3.3% with c.-1 + 26G&gt;T; 2.5% with c.-147_-146insGCCA; and 0.4% with c.-174G&gt;A. Interestingly, the c.-147_-146insGCCA, which has been found in a black American and French Caribbean control population, was not found in 500 Caucasian control chromosomes we studied. However, it was found in association with the same haplotype distribution of four intronic polymorphisms in our patients with DBA. Although a polymorphism, the frequency of this variant in the patients with DBA and its association with the same haplotype raises the possibility that this polymorphism and the other genetic variations in the noncoding region could play a role in DBA pathogenesis.",M1
20022637,"Ocular and orbital manifestations of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes: Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita.PURPOSE: The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that share the inability of the bone marrow to produce an adequate number of blood cells. The 4 most frequent syndromes are Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). All 4 syndromes have been associated with various physical abnormalities. As part of a genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility study, we determined the prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations in these 4 syndromes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a patient cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five patients with an IBMFS and 121 of their first-degree relatives were seen in the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, from 2001 to 2007. The patient group included 22 with FA, 28 with DC, 19 with DBA, and 6 with SDS. METHODS: Every participant underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation and digital facial photography with an adhesive paper ruler on the patient's forehead for an internal measure of scale. Interpupillary distance (IPD), inner canthal distance (ICD), outer canthal distance (OCD), palpebral fissure length (PFL), and corneal diameter (CD) were measured. Thirteen of the 22 patients with FA underwent axial length (AL) measurements by A-scan ultrasonography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients with FA had at least 1 abnormal parameter, and 25% of patients had at least 4 abnormal parameters. Eighty-two percent of patients had small palpebral fissures, 69% of patients had simple microphthalmia, 64% of patients had small OCD, 55% of patients had microcornea, 28% of patients had ptosis, and 6% of patients had epicanthal folds. In patients with DC, abnormalities of the lacrimal drainage system (29%) were the most prevalent findings, followed by retinal abnormalities (pigmentary changes, retinal neovascularization, retinal detachment, exudative retinopathy) in 21%, cicatricial entropion with trichiasis and blepharitis in 7% each, and sparse eyelashes and congenital cataract in 3.5% each. No significant ophthalmic abnormalities were seen in patients with DBA or SDS. CONCLUSIONS: Syndrome-specific ocular findings are associated with FA and DC and may antedate diagnosis of the specific syndrome. Early recognition of these abnormalities is important for optimal management.",M1
19958353,"Pathogenesis of the erythroid failure in Diamond Blackfan anaemia.Diamond Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a severe congenital failure of erythropoiesis. Despite mutations in one of several ribosome protein genes, including RPS19, the cause of the erythroid specificity is still a mystery. We hypothesized that, because the chromatin of late erythroid cells becomes condensed and transcriptionally inactive prior to enucleation, the rapidly proliferating immature cells require very high ribosome synthetic rates. RNA biogenesis was measured in primary mouse fetal liver erythroid progenitor cells; during the first 24 h, cell number increased three to fourfold while, remarkably, RNA content increased sixfold, suggesting an accumulation of an excess of ribosomes during early erythropoiesis. Retrovirus infected siRNA RPS19 knockdown cells showed reduced proliferation but normal differentiation, and cell cycle analysis showed a G1/S phase delay. p53 protein was increased in the knockdown cells, and the mRNA level for p21, a transcriptional target of p53, was increased. Furthermore, we show that RPS19 knockdown decreased MYB protein, and Kit mRNA was reduced, as was the amount of cell surface KIT protein. Thus, in this small hairpin RNA murine model of DBA, RPS19 insufficient erythroid cells may proliferate poorly because of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, and also because of decreased expression of the key erythroid signalling protein KIT.",M1

We report a novel mutation in the RPS17 gene in a Korean patient with DBA. The mutation occurred in the translation initiation codon, changing Atg to Gtg (c.1A&gt;G), thus disrupting the natural start of the RPS17 protein biosynthesis. This is the third case of DBA from a RPS17 mutation in the literature and is the second case of a RPS17 mutation in the translation initiation codon, following c.2T&gt;G.",M1
19915471,"Diamond Blackfan anemia 2008-2009: broadening the scope of ribosome biogenesis disorders.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by erythroid failure, congenital anomalies and predisposition to cancer. Recently, the notion of DBA as a disorder of ribosome biogenesis has been clarified. Correlations between molecular underpinnings and disease pathophysiology, while elusive, are beginning to emerge. Advances in these areas will be explored in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: All known genes mutated in DBA encode ribosomal proteins associated with either the small (RPS) or large (RPL) subunit and in these cases ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency gives rise to the disease. The number of genes affected, their potential interactions with the environment and modifier genes, and the myriad of potential signaling pathways linking abortive ribosome synthesis to cell-cycle regulators may all contribute to disease heterogeneity. Genotype/phenotype relationships emerging over the past year promise to shed light on these complex interrelationships and their role in DBA pathophysiology. SUMMARY: The nosology of DBA has recently expanded to include two distinct disease categories: a classical inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and a 'ribosomopathy'. The description of DBA as a ribosomopathy has provided a context for scientific inquiry analogous to the description of Fanconi anemia as a disorder of DNA repair.",M1
19816270,"Curvilinear mandibular distraction in a patient with mandibulofacial dysostosis associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital erythroid aplasia or hypoplasia presenting in infancy as a macrocytic anemia. It has been linked to a gene defect resulting in the absence of specific ribosomal proteins that enable erythroid maturation. Treacher Collins syndrome is also associated with defective ribosomal biogenesis. Fifty percent of patients with DBA also present with additional physical abnormalities including growth delay, craniofacial abnormalities, upper limp abnormalities, cardiac defects, urogenital malformations, and cleft palate. Upper airway obstruction may be a complication from craniofacial disorders and may be responsible for life-threatening sleep apnea that may result in pneumonia or respiratory failure. This report is of a patient with DBA who presented at birth with respiratory distress secondary to tongue-based obstruction of the airway due to mandibulofacial dysostosis leading to need for intubation. In an effort to avoid a tracheostomy, the patient underwent bilateral internal mandibular osteodistraction on day 4 of life with a latency period of 0 days and a distraction at a rate of 2 mm/d for 10 days until a class 3 dental occlusion existed with 5 mm of overcorrection. In addition, the patient was born with choanal atresia that was repaired at day 30 of life. After completion of the mandibular distraction, the patient has avoided tracheostomy and is now 6 months of age. Recent polysomnogram has demonstrated no significant apnea or hypopnea.",M1
19810012,"Severe iron overload in Blackfan-Diamond anemia: a case-control study.Chronic iron overload is a serious complication in transfusion-dependent patients. Few studies have addressed this issue in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>). We describe a retrospective analysis of iron overload, and its related complications in 31 transfusion-dependent Italian DBA patients whose records included one or more evaluation of liver iron concentration (LIC) by means of noninvasive magnetic liver susceptometry with a superconductive quantum interference device (SQUID). This cohort is also matched with a group of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major patients to look for differences. A severe iron overload was observed in 54% patients, especially among those inadequately chelated. The DBA patients displayed a significantly higher LIC than the regularly chelated beta-thalassemics. This difference may have been attributable to nonoptimal chelation (late onset, type, dose, prescription, and compliance), or an unknown biological mechanism that lead to an early severe iron overload. We therefore suggest that all transfusion patients should have an accurate record of their iron intake, a regular monitoring of iron overload, in order to start chelation when a critical transfusion load is reached, and to test the efficacy/compliance of chelation treatment. Physicians taking care of transfusion-dependent DBA patients must be concerned about the frequent and early complications such as cardiac toxicity. Am. J. Hematol., 2009.

19770060,"Congenital disorders of ribosome biogenesis and bone marrow failure.Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital bone marrow (BM) failure syndrome that typically results in macrocytic anemia within the first year of life. DBA is also associated with birth defects, increased incidence of cancer, and other cytopenias. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a multisystem disease characterized by exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, impaired hematopoiesis, and leukemia predisposition. Other clinical features include skeletal, immunologic, hepatic, and cardiac disorders.

19765279,"Fibroblasts from patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia show abnormal expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism and cancer.BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare inherited red cell hypoplasia characterised by a defect in the maturation of erythroid progenitors and in some cases associated with malformations. Patients have an increased risk of solid tumors. Mutations have been found in several ribosomal protein (RP) genes, i.e RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A. Studies in haematopoietic progenitors from patients show that haplo-insufficiency of an RP impairs rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. DBA lymphocytes show reduced protein synthesis and fibroblasts display abnormal rRNA processing and impaired proliferation. RESULTS: To evaluate the involvement of non-haematopoietic tissues in DBA, we have analysed global gene expression in fibroblasts from DBA patients compared to healthy controls. Microarray expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays revealed that 421 genes are differentially expressed in DBA patient fibroblasts. These genes include a large cluster of ribosomal proteins and factors involved in protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes associated to cell death, cancer and tissue development. CONCLUSION: This analysis reports for the first time an abnormal gene expression profile in a non-haematopoietic cell type in DBA. These data support the hypothesis that DBA may be due to a defect in general or specific protein synthesis.",M1
19689926,"Ribosomal protein S19 and S24 insufficiency cause distinct cell cycle defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a severe congenital anemia characterized by a specific decrease of erythroid precursors. The disease is also associated with growth retardation, congenital malformations, a predisposition for malignant disease and heterozygous mutations in either of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes RPS7, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11 and RPL35a. We show herein that primary fibroblasts from DBA patients with truncating mutations in RPS19 or in RPS24 have a marked reduction in proliferative capacity. Mutant fibroblasts are associated with extended cell cycles and normal levels of p53 when compared to w.t. cells. RPS19 mutant fibroblasts accumulate in the G1 phase, whereas the RPS24 mutant cells show an altered progression in the S phase resulting in reduced levels in the G2/M phase. RPS19 deficient cells exhibit reduced levels of Cyclin-E, CDK2 and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein supporting a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In contrast, RPS24 deficient cells show increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and a seemingly opposing increase in Cyclin-E, CDK4 and CDK6. In combination, our results show that RPS19 and RPS24 insufficient fibroblasts have an impaired growth caused by distinct blockages in the cell cycle. We suggest this proliferative constraint to be an important contributing mechanism for the complex extra-hematological features observed in DBA.",M1
19587786,"Targeted resequencing and analysis of the Diamond-Blackfan anemia disease locus RPS19.BACKGROUND: The Ribosomal protein S19 gene locus (RPS19) has been linked to two kinds of red cell aplasia, Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (<e>DBA</e>) and Transient Erythroblastopenia in Childhood (TEC). Mutations in RPS19 coding sequences have been found in 25% of DBA patients, but not in TEC patients. It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia. We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding variations associated with DBA or TEC phenotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We targeted a region of 19'980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). CONCLUSIONS: Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to treatment.",M1
19489057,"Analysis of telomeres in peripheral blood cells from patients with bone marrow failure.BACKGROUND: The determination of telomere length is useful for the characterization of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and of aplastic anemias (AA) as well as hematological malignancies. Short telomeres result from a specific defect of telomere maintenance in DC and likely from higher cellular turnover in AA and hematological malignancies. Data are not conclusive for Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a pure erythroid aplasia due to defects of ribosomal proteins. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of a qPCR method for telomere length assessment to evaluate the diagnostic contribution of telomere measurement in bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS). PROCEDURE: Telomere length was evaluated by qPCR in peripheral blood cells from 95 normal individuals and 62 patients with BMFS, including 45 patients with DBA. RESULTS: Results obtained with qPCR are comparable with other quantitative methods, such as flow-FISH and Southern blotting. Our data show that only one DBA patient and a minority of other BMFS patients have very short telomeres, defined as less than the 1st percentile of controls. CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR method for telomere length evaluation is an easy alternative to other methods and may thus be valuable in a clinical hematological laboratory setting. Telomere maintenance does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of DBA unlike in other BMFSs.",M1

We hypothesized that decreased levels of RPS19 lead to a coordinated down-regulation of other ribosomal (r-)proteins at the subunit level. We show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of RPS19 results in a relative decrease of small subunit (SSU) r-proteins (S20, S21 and S24) when compared to large subunit (LSU) r-proteins (L3, L9, L30 and L38). This correlates with a relative decrease in 18S rRNA with respect to 28S rRNA. The r-protein mRNA levels remain relatively unchanged indicating a post transcriptional regulation of r-proteins at the level of subunit formation.",M1

19191325,"Identification of mutations in the ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) and ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) genes in Czech patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital red blood cell aplasia that is usually diagnosed during early infancy. Apart from defects in red blood cell maturation, the disorder is also associated with various physical anomalies in 40% of patients. Mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 are found in 25% of patients, while mutations in other proteins of the small ribosomal subunit--RPS17 and RPS24--have been found in a fraction of patients. Recently, mutations in RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35a of the large ribosomal subunit have also been reported in several DBA patients. Here, we present the identification of mutations in the RPL5 and RPL11 genes in patients from the Czech DBA Registry. Mutations in RPL5 were identified in eight patients from 6 out of 28 families (21.4%), and mutations in RPL11 in two patients from 2 out of 28 families (7.1%). Interestingly, all 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation exhibited one or more physical anomalies; specifically, thumb anomalies (flat thenar) were always present, while no such anomaly was observed in seven patients with an RPS19 mutation. Moreover, 9 out of 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation were born small for gestational age (SGA) compared to 3 out of 7 patients from the RPS19-mutated group. These observations may suggest that mutations, at least in RPL5, seem to generally have more profound impact on fetal development than mutations in RPS19. Since RPL5 and RPL11, together with RPL23, are also involved in the MDM2-mediated p53 pathway regulation, we also screened the RPL23 gene for mutations; however, no mutations were identified.",M1
19154697,"[Diamond-Blackfan anemia reveals the dark side of ribosome biogenesis]Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a rare congenital erythroblastopenia, has recently become a paradigm for a growing set of genetic diseases linked to mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins or factors involved in ribosome biogenesis. Recent studies of the structure and the function of ribosomal proteins affected in DBA indicate that their mutation in DBA primarily impacts ribosome biogenesis. Accordingly, cells from DBA patients display anomalies in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs. The explanation of this unexpected link between ribosome biogenesis, a ubiquitous process, and a disease mostly affecting erythroid differentiation may stem in part from the emerging concept of ribosomal stress response, a signaling pathway triggering cell cycle arrest in response to a defect in ribosome synthesis. Future studies of DBA and other diseases related to defects in ribosome biogenesis are likely to rapidly provide important insights into the regulatory mechanisms linking cell cycle progression to this major metabolic pathway.",M1
19061985,"Ribosomal protein L5 and L11 mutations are associated with cleft palate and abnormal thumbs in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital bone-marrow-failure syndrome, is characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, clinical heterogeneity, and increased risk of malignancy. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital anomalies that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. The disease has been associated with mutations in four ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A, in about 30% of patients. However, the genetic basis of the remaining 70% of cases is still unknown. Here, we report the second known mutation in RPS17 and probable pathogenic mutations in three more RP genes, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7. In addition, we identified rare variants of unknown significance in three other genes, RPL36, RPS15, and RPS27A. Remarkably, careful review of the clinical data showed that mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including craniofacial, thumb, and heart anomalies, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominantly present in patients carrying mutations in RPL11. We also demonstrate that mutations of RPL5, RPL11, or RPS7 in DBA cells is associated with diverse defects in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs in the large or the small ribosomal subunit production pathway, expanding the repertoire of ribosomal RNA processing defects associated with DBA.",M1

18715690,"Gene therapy of Diamond Blackfan anemia CD34(+) cells leads to improved erythroid development and engraftment following transplantation.OBJECTIVE: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia caused by mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Our aim is to develop gene therapy for DBA patients with mutations in RPS19. We previously demonstrated that RPS19 gene transfer partially corrects erythroid development in vitro. In this study, we asked if RPS19 gene transfer corrects erythroid development in unsorted cells transplanted to immunodeficient mice and if the RPS19-corrected fraction has a proliferative advantage after transplantation. We further determined if high level of RPS19 expression is required for correction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mobilized peripheral blood CD34(+) cells were transduced by oncoretroviral vector particles pseudotyped with the feline endogenous retrovirus envelope. Vectors containing two different promoters with different RPS19 transgene expression levels were compared. Transduced cells were transplanted to immunocompromised nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient-beta2 microglobulin null mice in order to assess therapeutic effects of RPS19 gene transfer in vivo. RESULTS: We show that correction of erythroid development requires high RPS19 expression. The corrected fraction of unselected DBA cells have a survival advantage in vivo, suggesting that successful gene therapy may only require correction of a fraction of the patient cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings are fundamental for development of clinical gene therapy for DBA because they demonstrate increased engraftment of RPS19-transduced cells without selection of gene-corrected cells prior to transplantation, an essential prelude to studying long-term therapeutic effects in emerging animal models for DBA.",M1
18697920,"The role of human ribosomal proteins in the maturation of rRNA and ribosome production.Production of ribosomes is a fundamental process that occurs in all dividing cells. It is a complex process consisting of the coordinated synthesis and assembly of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) with about 80 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) involving more than 150 nonribosomal proteins and other factors. Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is an inherited red cell aplasia caused by mutations in one of several r-proteins. How defects in r-proteins, essential for proliferation in all cells, lead to a human disease with a specific defect in red cell development is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of r-proteins in ribosome biogenesis in order to find out whether those mutated in DBA have any similarities. We depleted HeLa cells using siRNA for several individual r-proteins of the small (RPS6, RPS7, RPS15, RPS16, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS25, RPS28) or large subunit (RPL5, RPL7, RPL11, RPL14, RPL26, RPL35a) and studied the effect on rRNA processing and ribosome production. Depleting r-proteins in one of the subunits caused, with a few exceptions, a decrease in all r-proteins of the same subunit and a decrease in the corresponding subunit, fully assembled ribosomes, and polysomes. R-protein depletion, with a few exceptions, led to the accumulation of specific rRNA precursors, highlighting their individual roles in rRNA processing. Depletion of r-proteins mutated in DBA always compromised ribosome biogenesis while affecting either subunit and disturbing rRNA processing at different levels, indicating that the rate of ribosome production rather than a specific step in ribosome biogenesis is critical in patients with DBA.",M1
18671700,"Diagnosing and treating Diamond Blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference.Diamond Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare, genetically and clinically heterogeneous, inherited red cell aplasia.

However, as mutated genes have been discovered in DBA, non-classical cases with less distinct phenotypes are being described in adults as well as children. In caring for these patients it is often difficult to have a clear understanding of the treatment options and their outcomes because of the lack of complete information on the natural history of the disease. The purpose of this document is to review the criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the available treatment options, including corticosteroid and transfusion therapies and stem cell transplantation, and propose a plan for optimizing patient care. Congenital anomalies, mode of inheritance, cancer predisposition, and pregnancy in DBA are also reviewed.

18653748,"Deficiency of ribosomal protein S19 during early embryogenesis leads to reduction of erythrocytes in a zebrafish model of Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis in all cells. Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is one of the 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs) in vertebrates. Heterozygous mutations in RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), but the relationship between RPS19 mutations and the pure red-cell aplasia of DBA is unclear. In this study, we developed an RPS19-deficient zebrafish by knocking down rps19 using a Morpholino antisense oligo. The RPS19-deficient animals showed a dramatic decrease in blood cells as well as deformities in the head and tail regions at early developmental stages. These phenotypes were rescued by injection of zebrafish rps19 mRNA, but not by injection of rps19 mRNAs with mutations that have been identified in DBA patients. Our results indicate that rps19 is essential for hematopoietic differentiation during early embryogenesis. The effects were specific to rps19, but knocking down the genes for three other RPs, rpl35, rpl35a and rplp2, produced similar phenotypes, suggesting that these genes might have a common function in zebrafish erythropoiesis. The RPS19-deficient zebrafish will provide a valuable tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of DBA development in humans.",M1
18535205,"Abnormalities of the large ribosomal subunit protein, Rpl35a, in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. Small ribosomal subunit genes RPS19, RPS24, and RPS17 are mutated in approximately one-third of patients. We used a candidate gene strategy combining high-resolution genomic mapping and gene expression microarray in the analysis of 2 DBA patients with chromosome 3q deletions to identify RPL35A as a potential DBA gene. Sequence analysis of a cohort of DBA probands confirmed involvement RPL35A in DBA. shRNA inhibition shows that Rpl35a is essential for maturation of 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, 60S subunit biogenesis, normal proliferation, and cell survival. Analysis of pre-rRNA processing in primary DBA lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated similar alterations of large ribosomal subunit rRNA in both RPL35A-mutated and some RPL35A wild-type patients, suggesting additional large ribosomal subunit gene defects are likely present in some cases of DBA. These data demonstrate that alterations of large ribosomal subunit proteins cause DBA and support the hypothesis that DBA is primarily the result of altered ribosomal function. The results also establish that haploinsufficiency of large ribosomal subunit proteins contributes to bone marrow failure and potentially cancer predisposition.",M1
18515656,"Ribosomal protein S19 deficiency in zebrafish leads to developmental abnormalities and defective erythropoiesis through activation of p53 protein family.Mutations in several ribosomal proteins (RPs) lead to Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a syndrome characterized by defective erythropoiesis, congenital anomalies, and increased frequency of cancer. RPS19 is the most frequently mutated RP in DBA. RPS19 deficiency impairs ribosomal biogenesis, but how this leads to DBA or cancer remains unknown. We have found that rps19 deficiency in ze-brafish results in hematopoietic and developmental abnormalities resembling DBA. Our data suggest that the rps19-deficient phenotype is mediated by dysregulation of deltaNp63 and p53. During gastrulation, deltaNp63 is required for specification of nonneural ectoderm and its up-regulation suppresses neural differentiation, thus contributing to brain/craniofacial defects. In rps19-deficient embryos, deltaNp63 is induced in erythroid progenitors and may contribute to blood defects. We have shown that suppression of p53 and deltaNp63 alleviates the rps19-deficient phenotypes. Mutations in other ribosomal proteins, such as S8, S11, and S18, also lead to up-regulation of p53 pathway, suggesting it is a common response to ribosomal protein deficiency. Our finding provides new insights into pathogenesis of DBA. Ribosomal stress syndromes represent a broader spectrum of human congenital diseases caused by genotoxic stress; therefore, imbalance of p53 family members may become a new target for therapeutics.",M1

De novo mutations are common and familial cases display wide clinical heterogeneity. Twenty-five percent (25%) of patients carry a mutation in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 gene, whereas mutations in RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL11, and RPL5 are rare. These genes encode for structural proteins of the ribosome. A link between ribosomal functions and erythroid aplasia is apparent in DBA, but its etiology is not clear. Most authors agree that a defect in protein synthesis in a rapidly proliferating tissue, such as the erythroid bone marrow, may explain the defective erythropoiesis. A total of 77 RPS19 mutations have been described. Most are whole gene deletions, translocations, or truncating mutations (nonsense or frameshift), suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the basis of DBA pathology. A total of 22 missense mutations have also been described and several works have provided in vitro functional data for the mutant proteins. This review looks at the data on all these mutations, proposes a functional classification, and describes six new mutations. It is shown that patients with RPS19 mutations display a poorer response to steroids and a worse long-term prognosis compared to other DBA patients.",M1
18326324,"[Anemia in children]Anemia is one of the most common symptoms in children caused by numerous underlying diseases. In majority of patients, these diseases can be correctly diagnosed through physical examination, history taking, and routine laboratory tests. Bone marrow failure syndromes associated with several genetic diseases are rare causes of anemia in childhood. We reviewed the recent progress of molecular mechanisms in bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), and dyskeratosis congenita (DC), which are all predicted to involve defective ribosome synthesis. Delineation of the precise role of each gene product in ribosomal biogenesis and hematopoiesis may have both therapeutic and prognostic significance.",M1
18282522,"Diamond Blackfan anemia: a disorder of red blood cell development.Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is an inherited hypoplastic anemia that typically presents in the first year of life. The genes identified to date that are mutated in DBA encode ribosomal proteins, and in these cases ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency gives rise to the disease. The developmental timing of DBA presentation suggests that the changes in red blood cell production that occur around the time of birth trigger a pathophysiological mechanism, likely linked to defective ribosome synthesis, which precipitates the hematopoietic phenotype. Variable presentation of other clinical phenotypes in DBA patients indicates that other developmental pathways may also be affected by ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency and that the involvement of these pathways is influenced by modifier genes. Understanding the molecular basis for the developmental timing of DBA presentation promises to shed light on a number of baffling features of this disease. This chapter also attempts to demonstrate how the marriage of laboratory and clinical science may enhance each and permit insights into human disease that neither alone can accomplish.",M1
18230666,"Mutation of ribosomal protein RPS24 in Diamond-Blackfan anemia results in a ribosome biogenesis disorder.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare congenital disease affecting erythroid precursor differentiation. DBA is emerging as a paradigm for a new class of pathologies potentially linked to disorders in ribosome biogenesis. Three genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been associated to DBA: after RPS19, mutations in genes RPS24 and RPS17 were recently identified in a fraction of the patients. Here, we show that cells from patients carrying mutations in RPS24 have defective pre-rRNA maturation, as in the case of RPS19 mutations. However, in contrast to RPS19 involvement in the maturation of the internal transcribed spacer 1, RPS24 is required for processing of the 5' external transcribed spacer. Remarkably, epistasis experiments with small interfering RNAs indicate that the functions of RPS19 and RPS24 in pre-rRNA processing are connected. Resolution of the crystal structure of RPS24e from the archeon Pyroccocus abyssi reveals domains of RPS24 potentially involved in interactions with pre-ribosomes. Based on these data, we discuss the impact of RPS24 mutations and speculate that RPS19 and RPS24 cooperate at a particular stage of ribosome biogenesis connected to a cell cycle checkpoint, thus affecting differentiation of erythroid precursors as well as developmental processes.",M1
18217898,"Deficient RPS19 protein production induces cell cycle arrest in erythroid progenitor cells.The gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is one of the responsible genes for Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital erythroblastopenia. Although haplo-insufficiency of RPS19 has been suggested to be the onset mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of DBA, the sequential mechanism has not been elucidated. In order to analyse the consequences of the missense mutation of RPS19 specific for DBA patients, we made mutated RPS19 expression vectors. Twelve C-terminally Flag-tagged missense mutants were exogenously expressed from retroviral vectors and analysed by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. When these 12 mutants were expressed in the erythro-leukaemic cell lines K562 and human bone marrow CD34(+) cells, almost all of the mutant proteins (except for G120R) were unstable, and the levels of mutated RPS19 protein were significantly low. To address the effect of deficient RPS19 expression on cell proliferation, RPS19 was downregulated by siRNA. Repressive expression of RPS19 in human CD34(+) cells produced an elevated number of cells at G0 and induced erythroid progenitor-specific defects in BM cells. These results suggest that abnormal ribosomal biogenesis causes inadequate cell cycle arrest in haematopoietic progenitors, and that, subsequently, erythroid progenitors are specifically hampered. These in vitro phenotypes of genetically manipulated CD34(+) cells mimic DBA pathogenesis.",M1
18028431,"Relative response of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and other transfusion-dependent anaemias to deferasirox (ICL670): a 1-yr prospective study.OBJECTIVES/METHODS: This 1-yr prospective phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of deferasirox in regularly transfused patients aged 3-81 yrs with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; n = 47), Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>; n = 30), other rare anaemias (n = 22) or beta-thalassaemia (n = 85). Dosage was determined by baseline liver iron concentration (LIC). RESULTS: In patients with baseline LIC &gt; or = 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, deferasirox initiated at 20 or 30 mg/kg/d produced statistically significant decreases in LIC (P &lt; 0.001); these decreases were greatest in MDS and least in DBA. As chelation efficiency and iron excretion did not differ significantly between disease groups, the differences in LIC changes are consistent with mean transfusional iron intake (least in MDS: 0.28 +/- 0.14 mg/kg/d; greatest in DBA: 0.4 +/- 0.11 mg/kg/d). Overall, LIC changes were dependent on dose (P &lt; 0.001) and transfusional iron intake (P &lt; 0.01), but not statistically different between disease groups. Changes in serum ferritin and LIC were correlated irrespective of disease group (r = 0.59), supporting the potential use of serum ferritin for monitoring deferasirox therapy. Deferasirox had a safety profile compatible with long-term use. There were no disease-specific safety/tolerability effects: the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rash and non-progressive serum creatinine increases. CONCLUSIONS: Deferasirox is effective for reducing iron burden with a defined, clinically manageable safety profile in patients with various transfusion-dependent anaemias. There were no disease-specific adverse events. Once differences in transfusional iron intake are accounted for, dose-dependent changes in LIC or serum ferritin are similar in MDS and other disease groups.",M1

It is not known how the RPS19 deficiency impairs erythropoiesis and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. To elucidate molecular mechanisms in RPS19-deficient DBA, we analyzed the effects of RPS19 deficiency on erythropoietin (EPO)-induced signal transduction, cell cycle, and apoptosis in RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells. We did not find any abnormality in EPO-induced signal transduction. However, RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells showed G0/G1 arrest (82% vs. 58%; p &lt; .05) together with accumulation of p21 and p27. The fraction of apoptotic cells detected by Annexin V analysis also increased compared with control cells (13% vs. 3.1%; p &lt; .05). Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed that the level of bcl-2 and Bad was decreased and Bax was increased in RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells. Moreover, primary CD34-positive cells from DBA patients detected by Annexin V analysis also generated a higher number of apoptotic cells compared with normal CD34-positive cells during in vitro culture (38% vs. 8.9%; n = 5; p &lt; .001). Finally, we show that although RPS19 silencing reduces EPO-induced development of erythroid progenitors expressing glycophorin A (GPA), RPS19 silencing in cells already expressing GPA does not affect GPA expression. These findings indicate that RPS19 deficiency causes apoptosis and accelerated loss of erythroid progenitors in RPS19-deficient DBA.",M1
17726054,"Molecular basis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia: structure and function analysis of RPS19.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare congenital disease linked to mutations in the ribosomal protein genes rps19, rps24 and rps17. It belongs to the emerging class of ribosomal disorders. To understand the impact of DBA mutations on RPS19 function, we have solved the crystal structure of RPS19 from Pyrococcus abyssi. The protein forms a five alpha-helix bundle organized around a central amphipathic alpha-helix, which corresponds to the DBA mutation hot spot. From the structure, we classify DBA mutations relative to their respective impact on protein folding (class I) or on surface properties (class II). Class II mutations cluster into two conserved basic patches. In vivo analysis in yeast demonstrates an essential role for class II residues in the incorporation into pre-40S ribosomal particles. This data indicate that missense mutations in DBA primarily affect the capacity of the protein to be incorporated into pre-ribosomes, thus blocking maturation of the pre-40S particles.",M1

Clinical outcomes of 19 transplanted Japanese patients were analyzed. Prior to HSCT, 10 patients (53%) suffered hemosiderosis with organ dysfunction, and all eight with short stature (42%) had adverse effects of prednisolone. Median age at the time of HSCT was 56 months. Transplantation sources were 13 bone marrow [six human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, and six HLA-matched and one HLA-mismatched unrelated donors], five cord blood (two HLA-matched siblings and three HLA-mismatched unrelated donors), and one peripheral blood from haploidentical mother. All 13 patients with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and two with sibling cord blood transplantation (CBT) had successful engraftment. Of three patients who underwent unrelated CBT, one died after engraftment, and the other two had graft failure but succeeded in a second BMT from an HLA-disparate father and unrelated donor, respectively. One died shortly after haploidentical PBSCT. The five-yr failure-free survival rate after BMT was higher than CBT (100%: 40%, p=0.002). Platelet recovery was slower in seven unrelated BMT than in six sibling BMT (p=0.030). No other factors were associated with engraftment and survival. These results suggest that allogeneic BMT, but not unrelated CBT, is an effective HSCT for refractory DBA.",M1

In 40% of DBA patients, various physical anomalies are also present. Currently two genes are associated with the DBA phenotype--the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 mutated in 25% of DBA patients and RPS24 mutated in approximately 1.4% of DBA patients. Here we report the identification of a mutation in yet another ribosomal protein, RPS17. The mutation affects the translation initiation start codon, changing T to G (c.2T&gt;G), thus eliminating the natural start of RPS17 protein biosynthesis. RNA analysis revealed that the mutated allele was expressed, and the next downstream start codon located at position +158 should give rise to a short peptide of only four amino acids (Met-Ser-Arg-Ile). The mutation arose de novo, since all healthy family members carry the wild-type alleles. The identification of a mutation in the third RP of the small ribosomal subunit in DBA patients further supports the theory that impaired translation may be the main cause of DBA pathogenesis.",M1
17586729,"Ribosomal protein mutations in Diamond-Blackfan anemia: might they operate upstream from protein synthesis?The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are clinically distinct but share some common features. Difficult to treat and typified by a poor prognosis, their pathogenesis is unknown. Recent findings that some patients with the erythroblastopenia Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) have mutations in ribosomal proteins have led to the idea that this and perhaps other bone marrow failure disorders result from an inadequate supply of normally functioning ribosomes. According to this hypothesis, an insufficiency of the protein synthetic capacity limits the replicative potential of cells, with the DBA disease phenotype in particular arising from a block of one or more of the two to four critical, temporally compressed cell divisions in the differentiation program of the erythroid lineage in the fetal liver and the postnatal bone marrow. Here I propose an alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypothesis centered on nucleoli: the specialized intranuclear domains within which ribosomes are assembled. It was recently discovered that the nucleoli contain cell cycle machinery in close proximity to nascent ribosomes. Although mutations in ribosomal proteins might be expected to negatively influence the cell's protein synthetic capacity, I suggest it is also possible that the DBA mutations directly affect the nucleolus to destabilize or otherwise deregulate the coresident cell cycle machinery. This hypothesis envisions that the ribosomal protein mutations discovered in DBA act upstream from ribosome assembly by interfering with the staging of cell cycle progression machinery in the nucleolus, in a pretranslational mode of pathogenesis.",M1
17517689,"Missense mutations associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia affect the assembly of ribosomal protein S19 into the ribosome.RPS19 has been identified as the first gene associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia that includes variable physical malformations. It is mutated in approximately 25% of the patients although doubts remain as to whether DBA clinical phenotype depends on the ribosomal function of RPS19 or on an extra-ribosomal role or on both. RPS19 mRNAs with mutations that introduce premature stop codons or eliminate it are rapidly turned over by the surveillance mechanisms possibly causing a decrease in the RPS19 protein level. A decrease in RPS19 level has been shown to cause a defect in the maturation of 18S ribosomal RNA. Less clear is the effect of missense mutations in RPS19. With the aim of analyzing the functional features of mutated RPS19, we prepared cDNA constructs expressing RPS19 containing 11 missense mutations and a trinucleotide insertion found in DBA patients. After transfection, we analyzed the following properties of the mutated proteins: (i) protein stability, (ii) subcellular localization and (iii) assembly into ribosomes. Our results indicate that some RPS19 mutations alter the capacity of the protein to localize in nucleolar structure and these mutated RPS19 are very unstable. Moreover, none of the mutated RPS19 analyzed in this study, including those proteins that appear localized into the nucleolus, is able to be assembled into mature ribosome.",M1

17376718,"Cells depleted for RPS19, a protein associated with Diamond Blackfan Anemia, show defects in 18S ribosomal RNA synthesis and small ribosomal subunit production.The gene encoding the small subunit ribosomal protein 19 (RPS19) is mutated in about 25% of cases of the bone marrow failure syndrome Diamond Blackfan Anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a childhood disease characterized by failure of red cell production. In these cases DBA is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and RPS19 haploinsufficiency is thought to cause the disease. To study the molecular pathogenesis of DBA we used siRNA to decrease the level of RPS19 in two human cell lines, HeLa cells and U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Cells with reduced RPS19 levels showed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of small 40S ribosome subunits and mature 80S ribosomes and an excess of large 60S subunits. These cells were defective in 18S rRNA production and accumulated 21S and 20S nuclear pre-rRNA molecules, suggesting that RPS19 is required for specific steps in rRNA processing. RPS19 depletion produced a reduction in steady-state levels of RPS6 and RPS16 via a post-transcriptional mechanism while the levels of RPL7 and RPL26 were unaltered, indicating that levels of ribosomal proteins are determined by subunit assembly. This has interesting implications for the pathogenesis of DBA suggesting that deficiency of any of the RPS proteins might have a similar effect and thus may be responsible for causing DBA. Finally in cell lines from DBA patients with mutations we find increased levels of 21S rRNA precursors but no abnormality in the ribosome profile on sucrose gradients or in the steady-state levels of RPS19 suggesting that some cells can partially compensate for the loss of one allele of RPS19. We conclude that defects in ribosome biogenesis may underlie the pathology of Diamond Blackfan Anemia.",M1

The blood counts, checked weekly, dropped markedly between weeks 8 and 9. She rapidly developed a septicemia and was admitted with high fever (40.9 degrees C), white blood cell count 0.4 x 10(9)/L, absolute neutrophil count 0.1 x 10(9)/L and platelets 114 x 10(9)/L. She was administered broad spectrum antibiotics, G-CSF (10 microgram/kg daily) and corticosteroids but remained neutropenic and died 6 weeks after admission. Bone marrow examination day 23 revealed areas with low cellularity (around 30%), but also areas with infiltrates of T cells; granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis were scarce. We conclude that weekly neutrophil monitoring is not sufficient to avoid fatal agranulocytosis. We suggest that deferiprone not be prescribed to DBA patients unless the clinical indications are particularly strong, and that the risk of agranulocytosis in thalassemia patients be carefully considered.",M1

Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), currently the only gene associated with DBA, is mutated in 25% of DBA patients, but its role in erythropoiesis is unknown. We attempted to elucidate the importance of RPS19 in translation in relation to the pathogenesis of DBA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured translation and proliferation rates in unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from DBA patients, as well as in K562 cells expressing several RPS19 mutants to directly test the effect of RPS19 mutations on translation. The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied. RESULTS: We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated DBA lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19. The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated DBA cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation. In unstimulated DBA cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA. Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of DBA, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some DBA patients.",M1
17053056,"Impaired ribosome biogenesis in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.The gene encoding the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital erythroblastopenia. The consequence of these mutations on the onset of the disease remains obscure. Here, we show that RPS19 plays an essential role in biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit in human cells. Knockdown of RPS19 expression by siRNAs impairs 18S rRNA synthesis and formation of 40S subunits and induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Pre-rRNA processing is altered, which leads to an arrest in the maturation of precursors to the 18S rRNA. Under these conditions, pre-40S particles are not exported to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the nucleoplasm of the cells in perinuclear dots. Consistently, we find that ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization is altered in skin fibroblasts from DBA patients bearing mutations in the RPS19 gene. In addition, maturation of the 18S rRNA is also perturbed in cells from a patient bearing no RPS19-related mutation. These results support the hypothesis that DBA is directly related to a defect in ribosome biogenesis and indicate that yet to be discovered DBA-related genes may be involved in the synthesis of the ribosomal subunits.",M1

The only gene currently known to be mutated in DBA encodes ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19). Previous studies have shown that the yeast RPS19 protein is required for a specific step in the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Our objective here was to determine whether the human RPS19 protein functions at a similar step in 40S subunit maturation. Studies where RPS19 expression is reduced by siRNA in the hematopoietic cell line, TF-1, show that human RPS19 is also required for a specific step in the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. This maturation defect can be monitored by studying rRNA-processing intermediates along the ribosome synthesis pathway. Analysis of these intermediates in CD34- cells from the bone marrow of patients with DBA harboring mutations in RPS19 revealed a pre-rRNA-processing defect similar to that observed in TF-1 cells where RPS19 expression was reduced. This defect was observed to a lesser extent in CD34+ cells from patients with DBA who have mutations in RPS19.",M1
16942586,"Recent insights into the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anaemia.Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital anaemia and broad developmental disease that develops soon after birth. The anaemia is due to failure of erythropoiesis, with normal platelet and myeloid lineages, and it can be managed with steroids, blood transfusions, or stem cell transplantation. Normal erythropoiesis after transplantation shows that the defect is intrinsic to an erythroid precursor. DBA is inherited in about 10-20% of cases, and genetic studies have identified mutations in a ribosomal protein gene, RPS19, in 25% of cases; there is evidence for involvement of at least two other genes. In yeast, RPS19 deletion leads to a block in ribosomal RNA biogenesis. The critical question is how mutations in RPS19 lead to the failure of proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors. While this question has not yet been answered, understanding the biology of DBA may provide insight not only into the defect in erythropoisis, but also into the other developmental abnormalities that are present in about 40% of patients, and into the cancer predisposition that is inherent to DBA.",M1

Faulty ribosome biogenesis is hypothesized to be the underlying defect, leading to erythroid failure due to accelerated apoptosis in affected erythroid progenitors/precursors. Since first observed in DBA, pro-apoptotic hematopoiesis has been recognized as a common mechanism for hematopoietic failure in virtually all of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, one of what appears to be multiple DBA genes, coding for ribosomal protein RPS19, has been cloned. The discovery of additional genes will no doubt clarify the molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. Even within families, individuals may vary dramatically as to the degree of anemia, treatment response, and the presence of congenital anomalies. The study of DBA has been facilitated by the creation of international patient registries that provide more reliable information regarding clinical presentation, genetics, and outcome, as well as descriptions of congenital malformations and cancer predisposition, than can be culled from the literature. Analysis of registry data has led to improvements in clinical care and provides patients and research specimens for clinical and laboratory investigations.",M1

To assess the pathophysiology of DBA, the gene expression profile of 2 representative patients carrying no RPS19 mutations was compared with that of aplastic anemia (AA) patients, assessed by the microarray analyses. The K-mean clustering analysis revealed the significant categorization of 28 ribosomal protein (RP) genes into a small set of group (994 genes) (P=2.39E-17), all of which were expressed at lower levels in DBA than in AA patients. RPS19 was categorized into the set of low expressing genes in DBA patients. No mutations were determined in the promoter and coding sequences of top 10 RP genes expressed at the levels over 1.2 of the AA/DBA ratio, in 3 DBA patients. These results indicated that the lower expression of RP gene group, even without the mutation, was a distinctive feature of DBA from AA, although the study number was small.

Mutations in ribosomal protein gene S19 (RPS19) are found in approximately 25% of DBA patients; however, the role of RPS19 in the pathogenesis of DBA remains unknown. Using global gene expression analysis, we compared highly purified multipotential, erythroid, and myeloid BM progenitors from RPS19 mutated and control individuals. We found several ribosomal protein genes downregulated in all DBA progenitors. Apoptosis genes, such as TNFRSF10B and FAS, transcriptional control genes, including the erythropoietic transcription factor MYB (encoding c-myb), and translational genes were greatly dysregulated, mostly in diseased erythroid cells. Cancer-related genes, including RAS family oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, were significantly dysregulated in all diseased progenitors. In addition, our results provide evidence that RPS19 mutations lead to codownregulation of multiple ribosomal protein genes, as well as downregulation of genes involved in translation in DBA cells. In conclusion, the altered expression of cancer-related genes suggests a molecular basis for malignancy in DBA. Downregulation of c-myb expression, which causes complete failure of fetal liver erythropoiesis in knockout mice, suggests a link between RPS19 mutations and reduced erythropoiesis in DBA.",M1

The mutated allele was not detected in the patient's family members, indicating de novo mutation. Both alleles were expressed at the same level. Using an immunofluorescence technique, the mutated RPS19 protein localized to nucleoli, and its intracellular distribution did not differ from the wild-type RPS19. The deletion of only a few amino acids of this protein with a preserved reading frame is rare, and this type of a mutation could be very helpful in further experiments to define the role of the RPS19 protein in DBA pathogenesis.",M1

16458028,"Erythropoiesis in the Rps19 disrupted mouse: Analysis of erythropoietin response and biochemical markers for Diamond-Blackfan anemia.The human ribosomal protein S19 gene (RPS19) is mutated in approximately 20% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital disease with a specific defect in erythropoiesis. The clinical expression of DBA is highly variable, and subclinical phenotypes may be revealed by elevated erythrocyte deaminase (eADA) activity only. In mice, complete loss of Rps19 results in early embryonic lethality whereas Rps19+/- mice are viable and without major abnormalities including the hematopoietic system. We have performed a detailed analysis of the Rps19+/- mice. We estimated the Rps19 levels in hematopoietic tissues and we analyzed erythrocyte deaminase activity and globin isoforms which are used as markers for DBA. The effect of a disrupted Rps19 allele on a different genetic background was investigated as well as the response to erythropoietin (EPO). From our results, we argue that the loss of one Rps19 allele in mice is fully compensated for at the transcriptional level with preservation of erythropoiesis.",M1
16317735,"Improving clinical care and elucidating the pathophysiology of Diamond Blackfan anemia: an update from the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry.Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by red cell aplasia, congenital anomalies, and a predisposition to cancer. Although incompletely understood, the erythroid failure in DBA appears to result from the accelerated apoptosis of affected erythroid progenitors/precursors. One of what appears to be multiple DBA genes, coding for a ribosomal protein RPS 19, has been cloned. Even within multiplex families individuals may vary dramatically as to the degree of anemia, response to treatment and the presence of congenital anomalies. The Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry (DBAR), a comprehensive database of pediatric and adult patients with DBA who are enrolled after informed consent, was designed to overcome two significant obstacles encountered in the study of a rare disease; the reporting bias inherent in the literature and the lack of an active patient database. To enroll, patients, their families and their physicians complete a detailed questionnaire. A review of medical records and telephone interviews are performed to complete and clarify the information provided. As of May 1, 2005, 420 patients have been enrolled in the DBAR. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data have been collected and analyzed. The DBAR has provided new information on the clinical presentation, outcome and genetics of DBA as well as a better description of congenital malformations and cancer predisposition. This has resulted both in improved clinical care of patients with DBA as well as providing new insights into the pathophysiology of this complex disorder.",M1

16266891,"Interactions between RPS19, mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the PIM-1 oncoprotein.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation. Patients' bone marrow progenitor cells do not respond to erythropoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin. Mutations in the gene encoding for ribosomal protein (RP) S19 account for 25% of cases of DBA. The link between defective erythropoiesis and RPS19 is still unclear. Two not mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: altered protein synthesis and loss of unknown extraribosomal functions. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used yeast two-hybrid screening and a human liver cDNA library obtained at 19-24 weeks of gestation, when hepatic erythropoiesis is efficient, to search for proteins interacting with RPS19. RESULTS: We found that RPS19 binds PIM-1, an ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase whose expression can be induced in erythropoietic cells by several growth factors, such as erythropoietin. The PIM-1/RPS19 interaction was demonstrated both in vitro and in living cells and led to phosphorylation of RPS19 in an in vitro kinase assay. We also showed that in human 293T cells PIM-1 interacts with ribosomes and may be involved in translational control. Three DBA-associated RPS19 mutations alter the binding between RPS19 and PIM-1. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A link between erythropoietic growth factor signaling and RPS19 has been identified for the first time.",M1

We studied the transplantation outcomes of 61 DBA patients whose data were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry between 1984 and 2000. The median age was 7 years (range, 1-32 years). Among 55 patients with available transfusion information, 35 (64%) had received &gt; or =20 units of blood before transplantation. Most patients (67%) received their bone marrow grafts from an HLA-matched related donor. The median time to neutrophil recovery was 17 days (range, 10-119 days) and to platelet recovery was 23 days (range, 9-119 days). Five patients did not achieve neutrophil engraftment. The 100-day mortality was 18% (95% confidence interval, 10%-29%). Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease occurred in 28% (range, 17%-39%) and chronic graft-versus-host disease in 26% (range, 15%-39%). The 3-year probability of overall survival was 64% (range, 50%-74%). In univariate analysis, a Karnofsky score &gt; or =90 and transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor were associated with better survival. These data suggest that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is effective for the treatment of DBA. Transplantation before deterioration of the performance status and from an HLA-identical sibling donor may improve survival.",M1

Although the anemia may initially respond to corticosteroid therapy, many patients require lifelong red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, leading to infectious complications and iron overload. Metoclopramide has recently been used to treat DBA. Treatment with metoclopramide induces the release of prolactin from the pituitary and stimulates erythropoiesis. For these reasons, we used metoclopramide to treat a 20-year-old man with DBA refractory to low and high doses of corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, and tacrolimus (FK506). The hemoglobin and hematocrit slowly increased, and he has remained asymptomatic and transfusion-independent for 8 months.

No models exist for RPS19-deficient DBA and the molecular pathogenesis is unknown. To establish an in vitro inducible model for DBA, human erythroid leukemic cell lines, TF-1 and UT-7 cells, were cotransduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against RPS19 controlled by a tet operator regulatory element and another transactivator vector containing the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene and the cDNA encoding a tetracycline-controllable transcriptional repressor. Following transduction, the RFP-positive and GFP-negative cell population was sorted by flow cytometry. Upon incubation with doxycycline (0.5 mug/ml), more than 98% of cells expressed GFP and the siRNA. Significant suppression of erythroid differentiation, cell growth, and colony formation was observed in cells treated with siRNA against RPS19 but not in cells treated with a control vector. These findings show that RPS19 plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation. These novel cell lines represent models for RPS19-deficient DBA and can be used to identify the molecular mechanisms in RPS19-deficient DBA.",M1

15755903,"An RNA interference model of RPS19 deficiency in Diamond-Blackfan anemia recapitulates defective hematopoiesis and rescue by dexamethasone: identification of dexamethasone-responsive genes by microarray.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital erythroblastopenia, is a model disease for the study of erythroid differentiation but is poorly understood. RPS19 is the only gene yet to have been associated with DBA, but its relevance to erythroid differentiation is unclear. The molecular basis for the stimulation of erythropoiesis by glucocorticoids in patients with DBA has not been identified. We demonstrate that targeted degradation of the RPS19 transcript, through retroviral expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), blocks the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells in cultured human CD34(+) cells. Treatment of RPS19-deficient cells with dexamethasone restores erythroid differentiation to normal levels. We investigated the molecular basis of pharmacologic therapies for DBA using oligonucleotide microarrays to survey gene expression in CD34(+) cells treated with combinations of dexamethasone, erythropoietin, stem cell factor, and interleukin-3. Dexamethasone did not alter expression of RPS19 but activated a genetic program that includes a set of key hematopoietic regulatory genes. Genes specific to erythroid progenitor cells were up-regulated by dexamethasone, while genes specific to nonerythroid lineages were down-regulated. Deficiency of RPS19 therefore blocks proliferation of immature erythroid progenitor cells, and dexamethasone activates proliferation of the same cell population through mechanisms independent of RPS19.",M1
15626736,"Deficiency of ribosomal protein S19 in CD34+ cells generated by siRNA blocks erythroid development and mimics defects seen in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital red cell aplasia in which 25% of the patients have a mutation in the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) gene. To study effects of RPS19 deficiency in hematopoiesis we transduced CD34(+) umbilical cord blood (CB) and bone marrow (BM) cells with 3 lentiviral vectors expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) against RPS19 and 1 scrambled control vector. All vectors also express green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transduction with the siRNA vectors reduced RPS19 mRNA levels to various degrees, which resulted in erythroid defects, correlating to the degree of RPS19 down-regulation, and was rescued by expression of an siRNA-resistant RPS19 transcript. Erythroid colony formation capacity conjointly decreased with RPS19 levels in CD34(+) CB and BM cells. In liquid culture supporting erythroid differentiation, RPS19-silenced as well as DBA patient CD34(+) cells exhibited reduced proliferative capacity and impaired erythroid differentiation resulting in fewer erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-Es). When assaying myeloid development, a less pronounced influence on proliferation was seen. This study shows for the first time that RPS19 silencing decreases the proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitors and leads to a defect in erythroid development.",M1

Various mutations have been identified in the RPS19 gene, but no investigations regarding the effect of these alterations on RPS19 mRNA levels have been performed. It is well established that mutated mRNA containing a premature stop codon (PTC) or lacking a stop codon can be rapidly degraded by specific mechanisms called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and nonstop decay. To study the involvement of such mechanisms in DBA, we analyzed immortalized lymphoblastoid cells and primary fibroblasts from patients presenting different kinds of mutations in the RPS19 gene, generating allelic deletion, missense, nonsense, and nonstop messengers. We found that RPS19 mRNA levels are decreased in the cells with allelic deletion and, to a variable extent, also in all the cell lines with PTC or nonstop mutations. Further analysis showed that translation inhibition causes a stabilization of the mutated RPS19 mRNA. Our findings indicate that NMD and nonstop decay affect the expression of mutated RPS19 genes; this may help to clarify genotype-phenotype correlations in DBA.",M1
15384984,"RNA and protein evidence for haplo-insufficiency in Diamond-Blackfan anaemia patients with RPS19 mutations.The genetic basis of Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>), a congenital erythroid hypoplasia that shows marked clinical heterogeneity, remains obscure. However, the fact that nearly one-quarter of patients harbour a variety of mutations in RPS19, a ribosomal protein gene, provides an opportunity to examine whether haplo-insufficiency of RPS19 protein can be demonstrated in certain cases. To that end, we identified 19 of 81 DBA index cases, both familial and sporadic, with RPS19 mutations. We found 14 distinct insertions, deletions, missense, nonsense and splice site mutations in the 19 probands, and studied mutations in 10 patients at the RNA level and in three patients at the protein level. Characterization of the mutations in 10 probands, including six with novel insertions, nonsense and splice site mutations, showed that the abnormal transcript was detectable in nine cases. The RPS19 mRNA and protein in CD34+ bone marrow cells identified haplo-insufficiency in three cases predicted to have one functional allele. Our data support the notion that, in addition to rare DBA patients with the deletion of one allele, the disease in certain other RPS19 mutant patients is because of RPS19 protein haplo-insufficiency.",M1

15238419,"Two-phase culture in Diamond Blackfan anemia: localization of erythroid defect.The erythroid defect in Diamond Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is known to be intrinsic to the stem cell, but its molecular pathophysiology remains obscure. Using a 2-phase liquid erythroid culture system, we have demonstrated a consistent defect in DBA, regardless of clinical severity, including 3 first-degree relatives with normal hemoglobin levels but increased erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity. DBA cultures were indistinguishable from controls until the end of erythropoietin (Epo)-free phase 1, but failed to demonstrate the normal synchronized wave of erythroid expansion and terminal differentiation on exposure to Epo. Dexamethasone increased Epo sensitivity of erythroid progenitor cells, and enhanced erythroid expansion in phase 2 in both normal and DBA cultures. In DBA cultures treated with dexamethasone, Epo sensitivity was comparable to normal, but erythroid expansion remained subnormal. In clonogenic phase 2 cultures, the number of colonies did not significantly differ between normal cultures and DBA, in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, and at both low and high Epo concentrations. However, colonies were markedly smaller in DBA under all conditions. This suggests that the Epo-triggered onset of terminal maturation is intact in DBA, and the defect lies down-stream of the Epo receptor, influencing survival and/or proliferation of erythroid progenitors.",M1

Malformations occur in about 40% of patients. More than half of patients respond to steroids; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell transplantation (SCT). Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 are found in 25% of patients, but the link with erythropoiesis is unclear. A second DBA locus has been found on chromosome 8p22-p23; analysis of genes of the region is in progress. METHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES: We present clinical and molecular data from 97 Italian DBA patients and a review of the literature. RESULTS AND STATE OF THE ART: We describe five new RPS19 gene mutations: four point mutations and one unbalanced chromosomal translocation. Hematologic findings, malformations and outcome are similar in the RPS19 mutated and the non-mutated groups. No genotype-phenotype correlation has been found so far in RPS19 mutated patients. Our data, however, and a thorough review of literature show a worse outcome (expressed as transfusion dependence) in patients with mutations that completely abolish one allele, i.e. gross chromosomal rearrangements and mutations at the initiation codon. The association of mental retardation with large deletions at the 19q locus points to a contiguous gene syndrome. A recurrent missense mutation (Arg62Trp) is associated with transfusion dependence in eight of the nine reported cases. PERSPECTIVES: Nationwide collaboration and population-based registries recording molecular data are essential for the further dissection of this rare heterogeneous disease and the definition of new therapeutic trials.",M1
15059149,"Diamond Blackfan anaemia in the UK: clinical and genetic heterogeneity.A detailed family study was undertaken of patients notified to the UK Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (<e>DBA</e>) Registry. RPS19 mutations were detected in 16 of 104 families, including two patients with deletions detected by intragenic loss of heterozygosity of tightly linked polymorphisms. In two further cases, polymorphisms were used to determine the parental allele of origin of RPS19 point mutations. A review of clinical details of patients with mutations and patients in the literature having identical or equivalent mutations revealed evidence for a genotype:phenotype correlation with respect to the prevalence of physical anomalies, and the occurrence of mild or variable haematological severity. Nine of 60 patients had a known family history of DBA. Haematological abnormalities, including raised red cell adenosine deaminase activity, were found in first-degree relatives of 16 of 51 (31%) of patients not previously considered to have familial DBA. Results of both parents and any siblings were normal in only 35 of 60 (58%) of cases, who were therefore assumed to have sporadic de novo DBA. The classical inheritance pattern for DBA is autosomal dominant; however, 12 of 60 families (20%) had more than one affected child despite normal results in both parents.

The annual incidence was 4.02 cases per million births, the median age at diagnosis was 60 days, and 59% of the cases presented by 3 months of age. Three patients had a familial occurrence. All patients received prednisolone (PSL), and cyclosporin A (CsA) was added to the therapy in 17 patients. Forty-seven patients received transfusions, and 13 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The cumulative probabilities of a medication-free or a transfusion-free state prior to HSCT were 36% and 69%, respectively, at more than 5 years after diagnosis. Thirteen patients were weaned from PSL therapy without HSCT, and CsA was not associated with weaning from therapy. Transfusion and medication were stopped at 249 days and 933 days after diagnosis in 34 and 13 patients, respectively, who achieved a state of independence. No initial findings predicted the treatment dependence. More than 20% of patients experienced sustained hemosiderosis and/or adverse effects of PSL. The ages and reticulocyte counts at diagnosis of the patients who underwent HSCT were lower than in the patients who did not. HSCT led to the highest success (85%) of all previous reports, even though 5 alternative donors were included in our study. Two cord blood transplants from unrelated donors failed.

To determine whether DBA stem cells are capable of producing early erythroid, monocyto-granulocytic, and lymphoid progenitors in vivo we used a mouse xenotransplantation model. We demonstrate that DBA stem cells poorly repopulated erythroid progeny in NOD/SCID mice, whereas the monocyto-granulocytic and lymphoid progenies were repopulated normally. Therefore, we conclude that disordered DBA erythropoiesis may be a result of defective erythroid-lineage commitment and maintenance of early erythroid progenitors.",M1

The other DBA cases carry mutations in other, unknown gene(s). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched mutations in 48 DBA families or isolated patients based on PCR of exons of the rps19 gene and automatic sequencing. We also studied three novel intronic polymorphisms in 85 persons (most of the patients and their relatives, when the latter could be investigated). RESULTS: We identified 10 new mutations within the rps19 gene. We found no obvious correlation between the clinical expression and the nature of the mutation. Besides, we found three polymorphisms within the rps19 gene. Polymorphisms a, b and c were (i) a one-base insertion (+c at position +79) in intron 2, (ii) the g--&gt;c substitution at position +89 also in intron 2 and (iii) the g--&gt;a substitution at position +14 in intron 4. Inheritance studies showed that the polymorphisms were transmitted en bloc, thus defining the --- haplotypes (changes absent) and the +++ haplotypes (changes present). The percentages of each haplotype were about 50% in families and isolated persons with DBA, as well as in controls. CONCLUSION: For the 10 novel mutations found in the rps19 gene, there were no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations. The transmission of the polymorphisms was en bloc and the studies did not suggest any clinical correlates at this stage.",M1
12718904,"Proliferation deficiency of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19)-deficient diamond-Blackfan anemia improves following RPS19 gene transfer.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a specific deficiency in erythroid progenitors. Since some patients with DBA develop a reduction in thrombocytes and granulocytes with age, we asked whether multipotent hematopoietic progenitors from DBA patients had normal proliferative capacity in liquid expansion cultures. CD34(+) cells derived from DBA patients showed deficient proliferation in liquid culture containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Single CD34(+) CD38(-) cells from DBA patients exhibited deficient proliferation recruitment in a limiting dilution assay containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF, Tpo, FL, and G-CSF or containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Our findings suggest that the underlying hematopoietic defect in DBA may not be limited to the erythroid lineage. Since a fraction of DBA patients have a deficiency in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), we constructed lentiviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene for overexpression in hematopoietic progenitors from RPS19-deficient DBA patients. Enforced expression of the RPS19 transgene improved the proliferation of CD34(+) cells from DBA patients with RPS19 mutation. Similarly, enforced expression of RPS19 improved erythroid development of RPS19-deficient hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony assays and erythroid differentiation cultures. These findings suggest that gene therapy for RPS19-deficient DBA is feasible.",M1
12586610,"Nucleolar localization of RPS19 protein in normal cells and mislocalization due to mutations in the nucleolar localization signals in 2 Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients: potential insights into pathophysiology.Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>), a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia. Recent studies have shown that RPS19 expression decreases during terminal erythroid differentiation. Currently no information is available on the subcellular localization of normal RPS19 and the potential effects of various RPS19 mutations on cellular localization. In the present study, using wild-type and mutant RPS19 cDNA, we explored the subcellular distribution of normal and mutant proteins in a fibroblast cell line (Cos-7 cells). RPS19 was detected primarily in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleoli, where RPS19 colocalized with the nucleolar protein nucleolin. Using various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs, we identified 2 nucleolar localization signals (NoSs) in RPS19: the first comprising amino acids Met1 to Arg16 in the NH2-terminus and the second comprising Gly120 to Asn142 in the COOH-terminus. Importantly, 2 mutations identified in DBA patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus. In addition to their mislocalization, there was a dramatic decrease in the expression of the 2 mutant proteins compared to the wild type. This decrease in protein expression was specific for the mutant RPS19, since expression of other proteins was normal.

It also provides an update on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to bone marrow failure of all types (inherited and acquired) in pediatric patients. In Section I, Dr. Alan D'Andrea reviews the wide range of clinical manifestations of Fanconi anemia. Significant advances have been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of FA. On the basis of these advances, new diagnostic assays and treatment options are now available. In Section II, Dr. Niklas Dahl examines the clinical features and molecular pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The possible links between the RPS19 gene (DBA gene) and the erythropoiesis defect are considered. In Section III, Drs. Eva Guinan and Akiko Shimamura provide an algorithm for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of children with inherited or acquired aplastic anemia. Through the presentation of a case study of a pediatric patient with bone marrow failure, he provides an overview of the newest tests and treatment options.",M1
12351378,"Gene transfer improves erythroid development in ribosomal protein S19-deficient Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a specific deficiency in erythroid progenitors. Forty percent of the patients are blood transfusion-dependent. Recent reports show that the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) gene is mutated in 25% of all patients with DBA. We constructed oncoretroviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene to develop gene therapy for RPS19-deficient DBA. These vectors were used to introduce the RPS19 gene into CD34(+) bone marrow (BM) cells from 4 patients with DBA with RPS19 gene mutations. Overexpression of the RPS19 transgene increased the number of erythroid colonies by almost 3-fold. High expression levels of the RPS19 transgene improved erythroid colony-forming ability substantially whereas low expression levels had no effect. Overexpression of RPS19 had no detrimental effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony formation. Therefore, these findings suggest that gene therapy for RPS19-deficient patients with DBA using viral vectors that express the RPS19 gene is feasible.",M1
12041668,"The effect of thrombopoietin on erythroid progenitors in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<e>DBA</e>) is a rare congenital red blood cell aplasia. Usually, erythropoiesis in vitro is defective, and decreased numbers of erythroid progenitors are found in colony assays performed with bone marrow cells. Recently, some investigators showed that thrombopoietin (TPO) also works on common multipotent progenitor cells and stimulates erythropoiesis. We examined the effect of TPO together with erythropoietin (EPO), stem cell factor (SCF), and/or interleukin-3 (IL-3) on erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) of bone marrow nonadherent mononuclear cells from 2 patients with DBA using a serum-free culture system. Very few BFU-E appeared in cultures containing EPO alone. Adding IL-3, SCF, or both to cultures containing EPO induced an increase in the number of BFU-E. When TPO was added to cultures containing EPO and IL-3, SCF, or both, the number of BFU-E further increased. Especially in patient 2, BFU-E formation was grossly equal to that in normal controls. We conclude that TPO enhances bone marrow erythropoiesis in patients with DBA in the presence of EPO and SCF and/or IL-3. The data raise the possibility of the combination of TPO and SCF as a therapeutic agent in DBA.",M1

The clinico-haematological profile of 16 patients with PRCA is presented in this communication. Fourteen patients had Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (<e>DBA</e>), one had transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, and one patient had PRCA secondary to carbamazepine. Physical abnormalities were observed in 50 per cent of patients with DBA. Of the nine patients with DBA who were administered prednisolone and had a regular follow-up, four (44.4 per cent) had no response, three (33.3 per cent) responded fully, and two (22.2 per cent) were steroid dependent.",M1
20462353,"Immunopathological studies of Leishmania amazonensis infection in resistant and in susceptible mice.Leishmania amazonensis infection was studied in mice to evaluate the evolution of leishmaniasis. The association of different methods, such as lesion kinetics, limiting dilution analysis, and immunohistochemistry, established different levels of susceptibility and resistance. Mice were arranged in 3 groups: susceptible (C57BL/10 and CBA), relatively resistant (<e>DBA</e>/2), and resistant (C3H.He). The histopathological analysis of primary lesions and draining lymph nodes showed a predominance of eosinophils and mast cells in the initial phase of infection in all mice. However, the most susceptible mice presented a greater number of amastigotes and higher tissue damage. The immunoglobulin analysis showed that susceptible mice produced high levels of antibodies, whereas resistant and relatively resistant mice exhibited low production of antibodies. Resistant mice showed parasite persistency in the skin and lymph nodes, suggesting that the infection in these mice can be sustained through the infection of cells such as dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and other cells present in these organs.",M2
20410117,"Metabolic vulnerability disposes retinal ganglion cell axons to dysfunction in a model of glaucomatous degeneration.We tested the hypothesis that glaucoma disrupts electrophysiological conduction properties and axon function in optic nerve as a function of intraocular pressure (IOP) levels and age in the <e>DBA</e>/2J mouse model of glaucoma. The amplitude and the integral of electrical signals evoked along the axons decreased considerably by 6 months of age as a function of increasing IOP levels. At young ages, raised IOP was directly associated with increased vulnerability to metabolic challenge. Changes in the physiological function of the optic nerves were accentuated with aging, leading to loss of compound action potential in an entire population of fibers: small, slow conducting axons. This loss was accompanied with loss of small fiber axon counts and declining metabolic reserve by demonstrating IOP-dependent ATP decrease in mouse optic nerves. These data shed light on a novel potential mechanism of glaucoma pathology whereby increased IOP and declining metabolic capacity lead to axon liability and eventually dysfunction and loss.",M2
20400699,"Variation in the Cd3 zeta (Cd247) gene correlates with altered T cell activation and is associated with autoimmune diabetes.Tuning of TCR-mediated activation was demonstrated to be critical for lineage fate in T cell development, as well as in the control of autoimmunity. In this study, we identify a novel diabetes susceptibility gene, Idd28, in the NOD mouse and provide evidence that Cd3zeta (Cd247) constitutes a prime candidate gene for this locus. Moreover, we show that the allele of the Cd3zeta gene expressed in NOD and <e>DBA</e>/2 mouse strains confers lower levels of T cell activation compared with the allele expressed by C57BL/6 (B6), BALB/c, and C3H/HeJ mice. These results support a model in which the development of autoimmune diabetes is dependent on a TCR signal mediated by a less-efficient NOD allele of the Cd3zeta gene.",M2
20392957,"Strain differences in stress responsivity are associated with divergent amygdala gene expression and glutamate-mediated neuronal excitability.Stress is a major risk factor for numerous neuropsychiatric diseases. However, susceptibility to stress and the qualitative nature of stress effects on behavior differ markedly among individuals. This is partly because of the moderating influence of genetic factors. Inbred mouse strains provide a relatively stable and restricted range of genetic and environmental variability that is valuable for disentangling gene-stress interactions. Here, we screened a panel of inbred strains for anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes at baseline (trait) and after exposure to repeated restraint. Two strains, <e>DBA</e>/2J and C57BL/6J, differed in trait and restraint-induced anxiety-related behavior (dark/light exploration, elevated plus maze). Gene expression analysis of amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus revealed divergent expression in DBA/2J and C57BL/6J both at baseline and after repeated restraint. Restraint produced strain-dependent expression alterations in various genes including glutamate receptors (e.g., Grin1, Grik1). To elucidate neuronal correlates of these strain differences, we performed ex vivo analysis of glutamate excitatory neurotransmission in amygdala principal neurons. Repeated restraint augmented amygdala excitatory postsynaptic signaling and altered metaplasticity (temporal summation of NMDA receptor currents) in DBA/2J but not C57BL/6J. Furthermore, we found that the C57BL/6J-like changes in anxiety-related behavior after restraint were absent in null mutants lacking the modulatory NMDA receptor subunit Grin2a, but not the AMPA receptor subunit Gria1. Grin2a null mutants exhibited significant ( approximately 30%) loss of dendritic spines on amygdala principal neurons under nonrestraint conditions. Collectively, our data support a model in which genetic variation in glutamatergic neuroplasticity in corticolimbic circuitry underlies phenotypic variation in responsivity to stress.",M2
20384817,"Mouse strain differences in locomotor, sensitisation and rewarding effect of heroin; association with alterations in MOP-r activation and dopamine transporter binding.There is growing agreement that genetic factors play an important role in the risk to develop heroin addiction, and comparisons of heroin addiction vulnerability in inbred strains of mice could provide useful information on the question of individual vulnerability to heroin addiction. This study examined the rewarding and locomotor-stimulating effects of heroin in male C57BL/6J and <e>DBA</e>/2J mice. Heroin induced locomotion and sensitisation in C57BL/6J but not in DBA/2J mice. C57BL/6J mice developed conditioned place preference (CPP) to the highest doses of heroin, while DBA/2J showed CPP to only the lowest heroin doses, indicating a higher sensitivity of DBA/2J mice to the rewarding properties of heroin vs C57BL/6J mice. In order to investigate the neurobiological substrate underlying some of these differences, the effect of chronic 'intermittent' escalating dose heroin administration on the opioid, dopaminergic and stress systems was explored. Twofold higher mu-opioid receptor (MOP-r)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was observed in the nucleus accumbens and caudate of saline-treated C57BL/6J mice compared with DBA/2J. Heroin decreased MOP-r density in brain regions of C57BL/6J mice, but not in DBA/2J. A higher density of dopamine transporters (DAT) was observed in nucleus accumbens shell and caudate of heroin-treated DBA/2J mice compared with heroin-treated C57BL/6J. There were no effects on D1 and D2 binding. Chronic heroin administration decreased corticosterone levels in both strains with no effect of strain. These results suggest that genetic differences in MOP-r activation and DAT expression may be responsible for individual differences in vulnerability to heroin addiction.",M2
20373399,"Cardiovascular phenotyping of the mouse heart using a 4D radial acquisition and liposomal Gd-DTPA-BMA.MR microscopy has enormous potential for small-animal cardiac imaging because it is capable of producing volumetric images at multiple time points to accurately measure cardiac function. MR has not been used as frequently as ultrasound to measure cardiac function in the small animal because the MR methods required relatively long scan times, limiting throughput. Here, we demonstrate four-dimensional radial acquisition in conjunction with a liposomal blood pool agent to explore functional differences in three populations of mice: six C57BL/6J mice, six <e>DBA</e>/2J mice, and six DBA/2J CSQ+ mice, all with the same gestational age and approximately the same weight. Cardiovascular function was determined by measuring both left ventricular and right ventricular end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction. Statistical significance was observed in end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and ejection fraction for left ventricular measurements between all three populations of mice. No statistically significant difference was observed in stroke volume in either the left or right ventricle for any of the three populations of mice. This study shows that MRI is capable of efficient, high-throughput, four-dimensional cardiovascular phenotyping of the mouse.",M2
20371546,"A quantitative trait locus on chr.4 regulates thymic involution.The mechanisms underlying age-associated thymic involution are unknown. In mice, thymic involution shows mouse strain-dependent genetic variation. Identification of the underlying genes would provide mechanistic insight into this elusive process. We previously showed that responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to transforming growth factor-beta 2, a positive regulator of HSPC proliferation, is regulated by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chr. 4, Tb2r1. Interestingly, Tgfb2(+/-) mice have delayed thymic involution. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a QTL on chr. 4 might regulate thymic involution. Aged, but not young, B6.D2-chr.4 congenic mice, where the telomeric region of chr. 4 was introgressed from <e>DBA</e>/2 to C57BL/6 mice, had larger thymi, and better maintenance of early thymic precursors than C57BL/6 control mice. These observations unequivocally demonstrate that the telomeric region of chr. 4 contains a QTL, Ti1 (thymic involution 1) that regulates thymic involution, and suggest the possibility that Ti1 may be identical to Tb2r1.",M2
20360247,"Effects of free immunoglobulin light chains on viral myocarditis.RATIONALE: In recent work, we have demonstrated a crucial role of mast cells in the development of viral myocarditis. Viral infection could lead to increased synthesis of free immunoglobulin light chains (FLC) and our earlier work showed that FLC can trigger mast cell activation. OBJECTIVE: We studied the possible involvement of FLC in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis, and therapeutic effects of FLC using an animal model of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: <e>DBA</e>/2 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Serum levels and concentrations in the heart of kappa FLC on day 14 in mice inoculated with EMC virus were significantly increased compared with controls. Myocardial viral concentration was significantly inhibited, the area of myocardial lesions was smaller in mice treated with kappa or lambda FLC, and survival of mice given FLC significantly improved. In contrast, an FLC antagonist deteriorated myocarditis. kappa and lambda FLC chains inhibited EMC viral replication in human amnion cells in vitro. lambda FLC significantly increased the gene expression of interleukin-10 in the heart which was previously shown to improve viral myocarditis when given exogenously. FLC also tended to increase the gene expressions of interferon-alpha and -gamma in the heart mice. CONCLUSIONS: FLC have antiviral and antiinflammatory effects and improved viral myocarditis in mice. FLC may be promising agents for the treatment of viral myocarditis.",M2
20345915,"Phenotypic characterization of a new Grin1 mutant mouse generated by ENU mutagenesis.In the RIKEN large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis project we screened mice with a dominant mutation that exhibited abnormal behavior in the open-field test, passive avoidance test and home-cage activity test. We tested 2045 progeny of C57BL/6J males treated with ENU and untreated <e>DBA</e>/2J females in the open-field test and isolated behavioral mutant M100174, which exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous locomotor activity. We identified a missense mutation in the Grin1 gene, which encodes NMDA receptor subunit 1, and designated the mutant gene Grin1(Rgsc174). This mutation results in an arginine to cysteine substitution in the C0 domain of the protein. Detailed analyses revealed that Grin1(Rgsc174) heterozygote exhibited increased novelty-seeking behavior and slight social isolation in comparison with the wild type. In contrast to other Grin1 mutant mice, this mutant exhibited no evidence of heightened anxiety. These results indicate that this is a unique behavioral Grin1 gene mutant mouse that differs from the known Grin1 mutant mice. The results of immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses suggested that impaired interaction between the glutamatergic pathway and dopaminergic pathway may underlie the behavioral phenotypes of the Grin1(Rgsc174) mutant.",M2
20335075,"<e>DBA</e>/1 mice exhibit chronic susceptibility to audiogenic seizures followed by sudden death associated with respiratory arrest.One proposed cause of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients is generalized convulsive seizures with respiratory malfunction. We evaluated DBA/1 mice as a chronic SUDEP model. In DBA/1 mice, audiogenic seizures induced by acoustic stimulation resulted in generalized convulsive seizures followed by respiratory arrest from postnatal day (PND) 21 to 100. The incidence of respiratory arrest susceptibility increased, reaching approximately 90-100% by three to seven daily seizures when testing began on PND 21-30. Respiratory arrest was reversible with resuscitation in approximately 98% of mice, which allows repeated seizure testing. Electrocardiographic activity in DBA/1 mice was detectable for approximately 4-6 minutes after respiratory arrest, indicating that death is likely due to respiratory cessation, as cardiac changes occur later. These findings suggest that DBA/1 mice are a useful chronic SUDEP model. These mice die suddenly from respiratory arrest after generalized convulsive seizures until reaching PND &gt;or=100, allowing testing of chronic preventive treatments for SUDEP.",M2
20308302,"Role of excessive inflammatory response to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia lung infection in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice and implications for cystic fibrosis.Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a pathogen that causes infections mainly in immunocompromised patients. Despite increased S. maltophilia isolation from respiratory specimens of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the real contribution of the microorganism to CF pathogenesis still needs to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenic role of S. maltophilia in CF patients by using a model of acute respiratory infection in DBA/2 mice following a single exposure to aerosolized bacteria. The pulmonary bacterial load was stable until day 3 and then decreased significantly from day 3 through day 14, when the bacterial load became undetectable in all infected mice. Infection disseminated in most mice, although at a very low level. Severe effects (swollen lungs, large atelectasis, pleural adhesion, and hemorrhages) of lung pathology were observed on days 3, 7, and 14. The clearance of S. maltophilia observed in DBA/2 mouse lungs was clearly associated with an early and intense bronchial and alveolar inflammatory response, which is mediated primarily by neutrophils. Significantly higher levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), GROalpha/KC, MCP-1/JE, MCP-5, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-2, and TARC were observed in infected mice on day 1 with respect to controls. Excessive pulmonary infection and inflammation caused systemic effects, manifested by weight loss, and finally caused a high mortality rate. Taken together, our results show that S. maltophilia is not just a bystander in CF patients but has the potential to contribute to the inflammatory process that compromises respiratory function.",M2
20305363,"Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of longevity in C57BL/6J by <e>DBA</e>/2J (BXD) recombinant inbred mice.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genes associated with longevity have been identified using both single gene and genome-wide approaches in a variety of species. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence longevity in male and female mice from twenty-three C57BL/6J by DBA/2J (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) strains. METHODS: Approximately 12 animals of each sex for each RI strain were maintained under standard conditions until natural death or moribundity criteria were met. RESULTS: A number of life span-relevant loci previously reported on chromosomes (Chrs) 7, 8, 10 and 11 were confirmed. In addition, 5 previously unreported QTLs for mouse life span on Chrs 1, 2, 6, 11, and X were identified as significant and 3 QTLs on Chrs 5, 8, and 16 were suggestive. CONCLUSIONS: Several QTLs were coincident in males and females although the modest correlation between male and female median lifespans and the identification of sex specific QTLs provide evidence that the genetic architecture underlying longevity in the sexes may differ substantially. The identification of multiple QTLs for longevity will provide valuable resources for both reductionist and integrationist research into mechanisms of life span determination.",M2
20233743,"Genomic analysis of variation in hindlimb musculature of mice from the C57BL/6J and <e>DBA</e>/2J lineage.The precise locations of attachment points of muscle to bone-the origin and insertion sites-are crucial anatomical and functional characteristics that influence locomotor performance. Mechanisms that control the development of these interactions between muscle, tendon, and bone are currently not well understood. In a subset of BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains, we observed a soleus femoral attachment anomaly (SFAA) that was rare in both parental strains (Lionikas, Glover et al. 2006). The aim of the present study was to assess suitability of SFAA as a model to study the genetic mechanisms underlying variation in musculoskeletal anatomy. We scored the incidence of SFAA in 55 BXD strains (n = 9 to 136, median = 26, phenotyped animals per strain, for a total number of 2367). Seven strains (BXD1, 12, 38, 43, 48, 54, and 56) exhibited a high incidence of unilateral SFAA (47-89%), whereas 23 strains scored 0%. Exploration of the mechanisms underlying SFAA in 2 high incidence strains, BXD1 and BXD38, indicated that SFAA-relevant genes are to be found in both C57BL/6J and DBA/2J regions of the BXD1 genome. However, not all alleles relevant for the expression of the phenotype were shared between the 2 high-incidence BXD strains. In conclusion, the anatomical origin of the soleus muscle in mouse is controlled by a polygenic system. A panel of BXD RI strains is a useful tool in exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying SFAA and improving our understanding of musculoskeletal development.",M2
20233662,"GABAB receptor activation exacerbates spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges in <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.Rich evidence has highlighted that stimulation of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)(B) receptors increases the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), the electroencephalographic (EEG) landmark of absence epilepsy (AE). Recent findings suggest that the outcomes of GABA(B) activation in vivo are contingent on the chemical characteristics of the agonist. In particular, the endogenous ligand gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor gamma-butyro-lactone (GBL) have been shown to elicit different effects than the prototypical GABA(B) agonist baclofen. In view of these premises, the present study was aimed at the characterization of the effects of baclofen (0.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and GBL (5-100 mg/kg, i.p.) on the spontaneous SWDs and locomotor activity of DBA/2J mice. While both baclofen and GBL dose-dependently increased SWDs episodes, high doses of the latter (100 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the occurrence of these phenomena and increased the number of isolated spikes. Interestingly, both compounds elicited a dose-dependent reduction of locomotor activity, in comparison with their vehicle-treated controls. The GABA(B) selective antagonist, SCH50911 (50 mg/kg, i.p.), reversed the changes in SWD occurrence and locomotion induced by baclofen and GBL, but failed to elicit intrinsic effects on either paradigm. These results indicate that GABA(B) receptor signaling might exert differential effects on SWDs in DBA/2J mice.",M2
20224169,"Indirect ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay for detecting the antibody against murine norovirus S7 in mice.To evaluate murine norovirus (MNV) infection in laboratory mice, we attempted to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system and an indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for detecting the anti-MNV-S7 antibody in mice. MNV-S7, which was isolated in Japan, was used in both assays. The antigen for ELISA was prepared by ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants of RAW 264 cells infected with MNV-S7. Positive sera were obtained from 6-week-old, female C57BL/6JJcl mice inoculated orally with MNV-S7. IFA against infected RAW 264 cells was able to discriminate positive sera from negative sera. Indirect ELISA was performed using 96-well ELISA plates coated with formalin-treated MNV-S7 antigen. In this ELISA system, mouse sera obtained 2 weeks after infection or later showed significantly high OD values and were judged positive. An equal level of anti-MNV-S7 antibody response was observed in BALB/cAJcl, C57BL/6JJcl, <e>DBA</e>/2JJcl, and Jcl:ICR mice; whereas, C3H/HeJJcl mice demonstrated slightly lower antibody production 4 weeks after infection. We also used this ELISA system to evaluate 77 murine serum samples obtained from 15 conventional mouse rooms in research facilities in Japan and found that approximately half of the serum samples contained antibody to MNV-S7. We found that some serum samples were negative for antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus and Mycoplasma pulmonis but positive for antibody to MNV-S7. The results suggest that the MNV infection is more prevalent than other infections such as mouse hepatitis virus and Mycoplasma pulmonis in conventional mouse colonies in Japan, as is the case in other areas of the world.",M2
20223839,"Genetic control of leucocyte--endothelial cell interaction in collagen-induced arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Despite considerable work on defining disease pathways, several aspects of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) remain poorly defined, in particular those contributing to the initiation phase of the disease. It is thought that in CIA the activation of circulating leucocytes, their interaction with the endothelial lining followed by subsequent transendothelial migration and infiltration into tissue represents the first and determining step in a complex sequence of processes mediating tissue injury. In this study we attempted to define the genetic basis of this stage of disease using genetic linkage studies, in-vivo imaging and expression profiling. METHODS: A genome scan with 132 informative markers was performed on 155 (<e>DBA</e>/1JxFVB/N) F2 mice. Linkage analysis was performed by combining genotyping data from the genome scan and the phenotypic data of leucocyte adherence, leucocyte rolling fraction, functional capillary density, centre line red blood cell velocity and capillary width as well as the expression level of the selected genes Cd44, Il13ralpha1, Ccr3, Defb3, Sele, Sell, Selp, Xcl1, Il1beta, Tnfalpha and Ifngamma as traits. RESULTS: Multiple classic quantitative trail loci (QTL) controlling leucocyte-endothelial cell interactions were identified on chromosomes 8 and 17 as well as expression QTL controlling the expression of several differentially expressed adhesion molecules and cytokines on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16 and 17. CONCLUSION: The study describes for the first time QTL controlling the CIA initiating leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction.",M2
20188254,"The successful immune response against hepatitis C nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) requires heterologous DNA/protein immunization.The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of NS5A protein of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) when delivered as naked DNA (NS5A DNA), or recombinant protein (rNS5A). <e>DBA</e>/2J mice received NS5A DNA, rNS5A, or NS5A DNA/rNS5A in different prime-boost combinations with a peptidoglycan Immunomax((R)). The weakest response was induced after rNS5A prime and NS5A DNA boost; rNS5A alone induced an immune response with a strong Th2-component; and NS5A DNA alone, a relatively weak secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. The most efficient was co-injection of NS5A DNA and rNS5A, which induced a significant increase in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts, anti-NS5A antibodies, specific T-cell proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro against a broad spectrum of NS5A epitopes.

20181699,"PB1-F2 expression by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus has minimal impact on virulence in animal models.Unlike previous pandemic viruses, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus does not code for the virulence factor PB1-F2. The genome of the 2009 H1N1 virus contains three stop codons preventing PB1-F2 expression; however, PB1-F2 production could occur following genetic mutation or reassortment. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the impact that expression of the PB1-F2 protein might have in the context of the 2009 pandemic influenza virus, A/California/04/2009 (Cal/09). We have addressed this question by generating two Cal/09 viruses with productive PB1-F2 open reading frames containing either an asparagine at position 66 of PB1-F2 (66N) or a serine at position 66 (66S): this N66S change has previously been shown to be associated with increased virulence in mice. We used these viruses to investigate the effect on virulence conferred by expression of the 66N or the 66S PB1-F2 protein in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our results show enhanced replication of the 66S virus in A549 cells, while studies of BALB/c and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice and ferrets revealed no significant differences in symptoms of infection with wild-type Cal/09 versus the 66N or 66S virus variant. Also, coinfection of mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae and the different viruses (recombinant wild-type [rWT] Cal/09 and the 66N and 66S viruses) did not result in significant differences in mortality. Mice infected with either PB1-F2-expressing virus did demonstrate altered protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines; differences were observed to be greater in infection caused by the 66S virus. In summary, our study demonstrates that PB1-F2 expression by the Cal/09 virus modulates the immune response to infection while having a minimal effect on virus virulence in two mammalian models.",M2
20165943,"The serotonin 2C receptor potently modulates the head-twitch response in mice induced by a phenethylamine hallucinogen.RATIONALE: Hallucinogenic serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor partial agonists, such as (+ or -)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), induce a frontal cortex-dependent head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents, a behavioral proxy of a hallucinogenic response that is blocked by 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. In addition to 5-HT(2A) receptors, DOI and most other serotonin-like hallucinogens have high affinity and potency as partial agonists at 5-HT(2C) receptors. OBJECTIVES: We tested for involvement of 5-HT(2C) receptors in the HTR induced by DOI. RESULTS: Comparison of 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout and wild-type littermates revealed an approximately 50% reduction in DOI-induced HTR in knockout mice. Also, pretreatment with either the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB206553 or SB242084 eradicated a twofold difference in DOI-induced HTR between the standard inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J and <e>DBA</e>/2J, and decreased the DOI-induced HTR by at least 50% in both strains. None of several measures of 5-HT(2A) receptors in frontal cortex explained the strain difference, including 5-HT(2A) receptor density, Galpha(q) or Galpha(i/o) protein levels, phospholipase C activity, or DOI-induced expression of Egr1 and Egr2. 5-HT(2C) receptor density in the brains of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J was also equivalent, suggesting that 5-HT(2C) receptor-mediated intracellular signaling or other physiological modulators of the HTR may explain the strain difference in response to DOI. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the HTR to DOI in mice is strongly modulated by 5-HT(2C) receptor activity. This novel finding invites reassessment of hallucinogenic mechanisms involving 5-HT(2) receptors.",M2
20152846,"Measuring persistent temporomandibular joint nociception in rats and two mice strains.Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain has been reported to last for prolonged periods in humans. In rodents a variety of methods have been used to measure TMJ nociception, but for most of these methods the period of measurement has been minutes to a couple of hours. In addition, most measurement protocols required restraint or training of the animal. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that feeding behavior, particularly meal duration, was an indicator of TMJ nociception in unrestrained and untrained male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for up to two days. In this study, we first found that injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ of rats significantly lengthened meal duration for 19 days and also decreased meal frequency for 42 days. Interestingly, the meal duration varied significantly from day to day within the 19 day period. TMJ interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were significantly elevated in the TMJ tissues of CFA-injected animals and the level of these markers was attenuated as the meal duration decreased with time. Control animals injected with saline into the TMJ or CFA into the knee did not show a significant lengthening in meal duration but did show a decrease in meal frequency. In a second study, <e>DBA</e>/1LacJ mice given TMJ CFA injections showed a significantly lengthened meal duration on four of the seven days measured using end-of-the meal definition of 5 or 10 min. No other meal pattern changed significantly. Two days post-CFA injection, the DBA/1LacJ mice showed significantly elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not elevated IL-1 beta. Seven days post-injection, both IL-6 and IL-1 beta were significantly elevated. No change in CGRP was detected. In this study C57Bl/6 mice also received TMJ CFA injections, but they did not show a lengthening in any meal pattern or significant increases in IL-1 beta, IL-6 or CGRP. Our data show, for the first time, that meal duration can be used to measure CFA-induced nociception in the TMJ over the course of several weeks in unrestrained rats and for up to seven days in the DBA/1LacJ mouse strain. In addition, C57Bl/6 mice are resistant to CFA-induced TMJ nociception at the same dose used in the DBA/1LacJ mice.",M2
20138902,"Comparison of C57BL/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice in food motivation and satiety.Demand functions describe the relationship between the consumption of a commodity and its mean or unit price. In the first experiment, we analyzed food demand in two strains of mice (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) that differ on several behavioral dimensions, but have not been examined extensively for differences in feeding and meal patterns. Mice worked for food pellets in a continuous access closed economy in which total intake and meal patterns could be measured. A series of fixed (FUP), variable (VUP), and progressive (PUP) unit price schedules were imposed. Under all schedules, DBA/2 mice consumed significantly more food than C57BL/6, a difference that was not attributable to disparity in body weight or weight gain. The higher intake of DBA/2 mice was due predominantly to larger meal size compared with C57BL/6, with no strain difference in meal frequency. In a second experiment, strain differences in meal size were not found to correlate with anorectic sensitivity to cholecystokinin (CCK) administration, or with c-Fos expression induced by CCK in PVN, AP and NTS. Thus, DBA/2 mice were motivated to sustain a higher daily food intake and meal size than C57BL/6 under the range of demand costs employed in the present work, but this strain difference is unlikely to be due to CCK action or responsiveness.",M2
20131264,"Interleukin-23 promotes Th17 differentiation by inhibiting T-bet and FoxP3 and is required for elevation of interleukin-22, but not interleukin-21, in autoimmune experimental arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of interleukin-23 (IL-23) in subgroup polarization of IL-17A-positive and/or interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-positive T cells in autoimmune disease-prone <e>DBA</e>/1 mice with and without collagen-induced arthritis. METHODS: A magnetic-activated cell sorting system was used to isolate CD4+ T cells from the spleen of naive and type II collagen (CII)-immunized DBA/1 mice. These CD4+ T cells were stimulated in vitro under Th0, Th1, or different Th17 culture conditions. Intracellular staining for IL-17A and IFNgamma was evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, Th17 cytokines and T helper-specific transcription factors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In CD4+ T cells from naive DBA/1 mice, IL-23 alone hardly induced retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat), Th17 polarization, and Th17 cytokines, but it inhibited T-bet expression. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)/IL-6 was a potent inducer of RORgammat, RORalpha, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and FoxP3 in these cells. In contrast to TGFbeta1/IL-6, IL-23 was critical for the induction of IL-22 in CD4+ T cells from both naive and CII-immunized DBA/1 mice. Consistent with these findings, IL-23 showed a more pronounced induction of the IL-17A+IFNgamma- subset in CD4+ T cells from CII-immunized mice. However, in CD4+ T cells from naive mice, IL-23 significantly increased the TGFbeta1/IL-6-induced Th17 polarization, including elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F and decreased expression of T-bet and FoxP3. Of note, the IL-23-induced increase in IL-17A and IL-17F levels was prevented in T-bet-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: IL-23 promotes Th17 differentiation by inhibiting T-bet and FoxP3 and is required for elevation of IL-22, but not IL-21, levels in autoimmune arthritis. These data indicate different mechanisms for IL-23 and TGFbeta1/IL-6 at the transcription factor level during Th17 differentiation in autoimmune experimental arthritis.",M2
20131240,"Fluoxetine and citalopram exhibit potent antiinflammatory activity in human and murine models of rheumatoid arthritis and inhibit toll-like receptors.OBJECTIVE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in addition to their antidepressant effects, have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to assess the antiarthritic potential of 2 SSRIs, fluoxetine and citalopram, in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in a human ex vivo disease model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Following therapeutic administration of SSRIs, paw swelling was assessed and clinical scores were determined daily in <e>DBA</e>/1 mice with CIA. Joint architecture was examined histologically at the end of the treatment period. Cultures of human RA synovial membranes were treated with SSRIs, and cytokine production was measured. Toll-like receptor (TLR) function was examined in murine and human macrophages, human B cells, and human fibroblast-like synovial cells treated with SSRIs. RESULTS: Both SSRIs significantly inhibited disease progression in mice with CIA, with fluoxetine showing the greatest degree of efficacy at the clinical and histologic levels. In addition, both drugs significantly inhibited the spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 in human RA synovial membrane cultures. Fluoxetine and citalopram treatment also inhibited the signaling of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9, providing a potential mechanism for their antiinflammatory action. CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine and citalopram treatment selectively inhibit endosomal TLR signaling, ameliorate disease in CIA, and suppress inflammatory cytokine production in human RA tissue. These data highlight the antiarthritic potential of the SSRI drug family and provide further evidence of the involvement of TLRs in the pathogenesis of RA. The SSRIs may provide a template for potential antiarthritic drug development.",M2
20114087,"Gene expression changes in the host response between resistant and susceptible inbred mouse strains after influenza A infection.Inbred mouse strains exhibit differences in susceptibility to influenza A infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown. Therefore, we infected a highly susceptible mouse strain (<e>DBA</e>/2J) and a resistant strain (C57BL/6J) with influenza A H1N1 (PR8) and performed genome-wide expression analysis. We found genes expressed in lung epithelium that were specifically down-regulated in DBA/2J mice, whereas a cluster of genes on chromosome 3 was only down-regulated in C57BL/6J. In both mouse strains, chemokines, cytokines and interferon-response genes were up-regulated, indicating that the main innate immune defense pathways were activated. However, many immune response genes were up-regulated in DBA/2J much stronger than in C57BL/6J, and several immune response genes were exclusively regulated in DBA/2J. Thus, susceptible DBA/2J mice showed a hyper-inflammatory response. This response is similar to infections with highly pathogenic influenza virus and may serve as a paradigm for a hyper-inflammatory host response to influenza A virus.",M2
20112355,"Amelioration of collagen-induced arthritis and immune-associated bone loss through signaling via estrogen receptor alpha, and not estrogen receptor beta or G protein-coupled receptor 30.OBJECTIVE: The effects of estrogen may be exerted via the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) ERalpha or ERbeta or via the recently proposed transmembrane estrogen receptor G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR-30). The purpose of this study was to elucidate the ER specificity for the ameliorating effects of estrogen on arthritis and bone loss in a model of postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Female <e>DBA</e>/1 mice underwent ovariectomy or sham operation, and type II collagen-induced arthritis was induced. Mice were treated subcutaneously 5 days/week with the specific agonists propylpyrazoletriol (PPT; for ERalpha), diarylpropionitrile (DPN; for ERbeta), G1 (for GPR-30), or with a physiologic dose of estradiol. Clinical arthritis scores were determined continuously. At termination of the study, bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed, paws were collected for histologic assessment, serum was analyzed for cytokines and markers of bone and cartilage turnover, and bone marrow was subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS: Treatment with PPT as well as estradiol dramatically decreased the frequency and severity of arthritis. Furthermore, estradiol and PPT treatment resulted in preservation of bone and cartilage, as demonstrated by increased BMD and decreased serum levels of bone resorption markers and cartilage degradation markers, whereas no effect was seen after DPN or G1 treatment. CONCLUSION: In a well-established model of postmenopausal RA, ERalpha, but not ERbeta or GPR-30 signaling, was shown to ameliorate the disease and the associated development of osteoporosis. Since long-term treatment with estrogen has been associated with significant side effects, increased knowledge about the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of estrogen is useful in the search for novel treatments of postmenopausal RA.",M2
20091782,"Glaucomatous optic nerve injury involves early astrocyte reactivity and late oligodendrocyte loss.Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease affecting retinal ganglion cells (RGC), is a leading cause of blindness. Since gliosis is common in neurodegenerative disorders, it is important to describe the changes occurring in various glial populations in glaucoma animal models in relation to axon loss, as only changes that occur early are likely to be useful therapeutic targets. Here, we describe changes occurring in glia within the myelinated portion of the optic nerve (ON) in both <e>DBA</e>/2J mice and in a rat ocular hypertension model. In both glaucoma animal models, we found only a modest loss of oligodendrocytes that occurred after axons had already degenerated. In DBA/2J mice there was proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and new oligodendrocyte generation. Activation of microglia was detected only in highly degenerated DBA/2J ONs. In contrast, a large increase in astrocyte reactivity occurred early in both animal models. These results are consistent with astrocytes playing a prominent role in regulating axon loss in glaucoma.",M2
20074669,"CEL-2000: A therapeutic vaccine for rheumatoid arthritis arrests disease development and alters serum cytokine/chemokine patterns in the bovine collagen type II induced arthritis in the <e>DBA</e> mouse model.The mouse model of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) effectively mimics human disease and thus is useful for testing and development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapies. We developed a Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System (LEAPS) peptide hetero-conjugate vaccine containing an epitope of human collagen type II (CEL-2000) that acted as a therapeutic vaccine in the collagen induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. LEAPS technology converts a small peptide containing a disease specific epitope into an immunogen by attaching it to an immune or T cell binding peptide (I/TCBL). For CEL-2000, a peptide from human collagen type II (254-273) is attached to the I/TCBL peptide from human beta2 microglobulin (J). Treatment with CEL-2000 limited disease (CIA) progression, as demonstrated by reduced Arthritic Index (AI) score, and footpad swelling. Efficacy was confirmed by histopathological microscopic examination of tissues at the end of the study. CEL-2000 limited disease progression as well or better than the etanercept (Enbrel) therapeutic control with significantly better histopathological results than the etanercept treated mice. Most interestingly, CEL-2000 therapy modulated serum cytokine levels with an increase in IL-12p70 and IL-10, which are not seen with etanercept therapy, and reduced IL-17 and TNF-alpha, also seen with etanercept, among other cytokines studied. CEL-2000 was safe and well tolerated for the mice that received 5 injections given every 2weeks in a 90day study supporting its potential usage for long term therapy. These studies demonstrate that fewer treatments with CEL-2000 provide therapy at least as effective as etanercept by specifically modulating the disease producing autoimmune response.",M2
20065147,"The impact of microsomal prostaglandin e synthase 1 on blood pressure is determined by genetic background.Prostaglandin (PG)E(2) has multiple actions that may affect blood pressure. It is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of phospholipases, cyclooxygenases, and PGE synthases. Although microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES)1 is the only genetically verified PGE synthase, results of previous studies examining the consequences of mPGES1 deficiency on blood pressure (BP) are conflicting. To determine whether genetic background modifies the impact of mPGES1 on BP, we generated mPGES1(-/-) mice on 2 distinct inbred backgrounds, <e>DBA</e>/1lacJ and 129/SvEv. On the DBA/1 background, baseline BP was similar between wild-type (WT) and mPGES1(-/-) mice. By contrast, on the 129 background, baseline BPs were significantly higher in mPGES1(-/-) animals than WT controls. During angiotensin II infusion, the DBA/1 mPGES1(-/-) and WT mice developed mild hypertension of similar magnitude, whereas 129-mPGES1(-/-) mice developed more severe hypertension than WT controls. DBA/1 animals developed only minimal albuminuria in response to angiotensin II infusion. By contrast, WT 129 mice had significantly higher levels of albumin excretion than WT DBA/1 and the extent of albuminuria was further augmented in 129 mPGES1(-/-) animals. In WT mice of both strains, the increase in urinary excretion of PGE(2) with angiotensin II was attenuated in mPGES1(-/-) animals. Urinary excretion of thromboxane was unaffected by angiotensin II in the DBA/1 lines but increased more than 4-fold in 129 mPGES1(-/-) mice. These data indicate that genetic background significantly modifies the BP response to mPGES1 deficiency. Exaggerated production of thromboxane may contribute to the robust hypertension and albuminuria in 129 mPGES1-deficient mice.",M2
20064544,"The impact of acute caloric restriction on the metabolic phenotype in male C57BL/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice.Caloric restriction (CR) extends healthy lifespan in many organisms. DBA/2 mice, unlike C57BL/6 mice, are reported to be unresponsive to CR. To investigate potential differences underlying the CR response in male DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice, we examined several metabolic parameters following acute (1-5 weeks) 30% CR. Acute CR decreased body mass (BM) in both strains, with lean and fat mass decreasing in proportion to BM. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was unaltered by CR, following appropriate corrections for BM differences, although RMR was higher in DBA/2 compared to C57BL/6 mice. Acute CR decreased fed blood glucose levels in both strains, decreased fasting blood glucose in C57BL/6 mice but increased fasting levels in DBA/2 mice. Glucose tolerance improved after 1 week of CR in C57BL/6 mice but improved only after 4 weeks in DBA/2 mice. Acute CR had no effect on insulin levels, but lowered insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in both strains. DBA/2 mice were hyperinsulinaemic and insulin resistant compared to C57BL/6 mice. These strain-specific differences in glucose homeostatic parameters may underlie the reported unresponsiveness of DBA/2 mice to CR. We also demonstrate delineation in the response of insulin and IGF-1 to acute CR in mice.",M2
20060461,"Effects of a high-frequency augmented acoustic environment on parvalbumin immunolabeling in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus of <e>DBA</e>/2J and C57BL/6J mice.Neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of DBA/2J (D2) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice were immunohistochemically labeled for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). Prior to this, mice were treated for 12h nightly with a  high-frequency  augmented acoustic environment (HAAE: repetitive bursts of a 70 dB sound pressure level, half-octave noise band centered at 20 kHz). This was done during the period that hearing loss occurs: pre-weaning to 55 days in D2 mice and weaning to 9 months in B6 mice. After HAAE treatment in D2 mice, high-frequency hearing loss was ameliorated and fewer PV-labeled neurons were found in the AVCN compared to untreated controls. HAAE treatment in B6 mice exacerbated high-frequency hearing loss, yet the number of PV-labeled AVCN neurons in treated mice did not differ significantly from that of control mice. The findings suggest that HAAE treatment provides relief from physiological stress caused by deprivation of auditory input from the impaired cochlea.",M2
20055122,"[Therapeutic efficacy of levofloxacin against a model of replicable Legionella pneumophila lung infection in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice]The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (LVFX), a quinolone antibacterial, against clinically isolated Legionella pneumophila were investigated in comparison with those of existing antimicrobial agents approved for legionnaires disease. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the agents against 42 strains of L. pneumophila isolated in Japan were determined using agar dilution methods with buffered starch yeast extract agar. MIC90 of LVFX was 0.03 microg/ml and this activity was similar to ciprofloxacin and pazufloxacin, and higher than telithromycin and minocycline. Therapeutic efficacy of LVFX was studied against a pneumonia model induced by intranasal of L. pneumophila strain suzuki serogoup 1 in DBA/2 mice. Therapeutic doses in mice were selected that would closely match human exposure profile, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for a human oral dose of LVFX at 500 mg once a day. LVFX decreased significantly the bacterial burden in the lungs from the next day of commencing treatment. These results, including in vitro antibacterial activity against clinical isolates and therapeutic efficacy of a humanized dosing regimen, provide good evidence to support the use of LVFX at 500 mg once a day for treating patient with legionnaires disease.",M2
20055121,"[Novel model of replicative Legionella pneumophila lung infection in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice]We present here a new model of Legionella pneumophila lung infection in DBA/2 mice. By intranasal inoculation with 106 colony-forming units of L. pneumophila strain suzuki serogoup 1, persistent non-lethal lung infection was established as reflected by the detection of more than 10(4) CFU/lung of the organism 14 days after infection. Treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide before infection enhanced bacterial replication in the lungs and all cyclophosphamide-treated mice experienced lethal infection. Histopathologically, the course of non-lethal lung infection was characterized by early response of neutrophiles, then monocyte/macrophages response in the alveoli with disease progression, and diffuse alveolar wall thickening with lymphocyte migration at later phase of infection. Transmission electron microscopic evaluation of the lungs confirmed that L. pneumophila located intracellularly within neutrophiles and infrequently intracellular bacteria were observed undergoing binary fission. Therefore, the mouse model of replicative L. pneumophila lung infection provides method for evaluating pathogenesis of L. pneumophila lung infection and antibacterial therapy.",M2
20050329,"Cooperative action of CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killer cells  controls tumour growth under conditions of restricted T-cell  receptor diversity.In mice expressing a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR; TCRP1A) of <e>DBA</e>/2 origin with reactivity towards a cancer-germline antigen P1A, the number of TCRP1A CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs is lower in DBA/2 than in B10.D2 or B10.D2(x DBA/2)F1 mice. This reduction results from haemopoietic cell autonomous differences in the differentiation of the major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted TCRP1A thymocytes controlled by DBA/2 versus B10.D2-encoded genes. We report here that the lower number of TCRP1A CD8+ T cells in DBA/2 mice correlated with their poor resistance to P1A-expressing mastocytoma solid tumours. Functional potency of CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) from the above strains was not compromised, but their number after expansion appeared to be influenced by their genetic background. Intriguingly, non-transgenic DBA/ 2 mice resisted P1A+ tumours more efficiently despite poor representation of P1A-specific CTL. This was partly the result of their more heterogeneous TCR repertoire, including reactivity to non-P1A tumour antigens because mice that had rejected a P1A+ tumour became resistant to a P1A) variant of the tumour. Such 'cross-resistance' did not develop in the TCRP1A transgenic mice. Nonetheless, reconstitution of RAGo/o mice with TCRP1A CD8+ T cells, with or without CD4+ T cells, or exclusive representation of TCRP1A CD8+ T cells in RAGo/o TCRP1A transgenic mice efficiently resisted the growth of P1A-expressing tumours. Natural killer cells present at a higher number in RAGo/o mice also contributed to tumour resistance, in part through an NKG2D-dependent mechanism. Hence, in the absence of a polyclonal T-cell repertoire, precursor frequencies of natural killer cells and tumour-specific CTL affect tumour resistance.",M2
20042456,"Influence of genetic background on albuminuria and kidney injury in Ins2(+/C96Y) (Akita) mice.Previous studies have shown that Akita mice bearing the Ins2(+/C96Y) mutation have significant advantages as a type I diabetes platform for developing models of diabetic nephropathy (DN; Gurley SB, Clare SE, Snow KP, Hu A, Meyer TW, Coffman TM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 290: F214-F222, 2006). In view of the critical role for genetic factors in determining susceptibility to DN in humans, we investigated the role of genetic background on kidney injury in Akita mice. To generate a series of inbred Akita mouse lines, we back-crossed the Ins2(C96Y) mutation more than six generations onto the 129/SvEv and <e>DBA</e>/2 backgrounds and compared the extent of hyperglycemia and renal disease with the standard C57BL/6-Ins2(+/C96Y) line. Male mice from all three Akita strains developed marked and equivalent hyperglycemia. However, there were significant differences in the level of albuminuria among the lines with a hierarchy of DBA/2 &gt; 129/SvEv &gt; C57BL/6. Renal and glomerular hypertrophy was seen in all of the lines, but significant increases in mesangial matrix compared with baseline nondiabetic controls were observed only in the 129 and C57BL/6 backgrounds. In F1(DBA/2 x C57BL/6)-Ins2(+/C96Y) mice, the extent of albuminuria was similar to the parental DBA/2-Ins2(+/C96Y) line; they also developed marked hyperfiltration. These studies identify strong effects of genetic background to modify the renal phenotype associated with the Ins2(C96Y) mutation. Identification of these naturally occurring strain differences should prove useful for nephropathy modeling and may be exploited to allow identification of novel susceptibility alleles for albuminuria in diabetes.",M2
20039431,"ANTI-CD3 therapy expands the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ Treg cells and induces sustained amelioration of collagen-induced arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To assess the therapeutic potential of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for rheumatoid arthritis, using collagen-induced arthritis as an animal model. METHODS: Arthritis was induced in <e>DBA</e>/1 mice by immunization with type II collagen. After disease onset, a single injection of anti-CD3 mAb (20 microg/mouse) was administered, and arthritis severity was monitored over a 10-day period. RESULTS: Anti-CD3 mAb treatment resulted in a sustained reduction in disease activity, which was associated with an increase in the proportion of naturally occurring CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and the generation of a population of CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. Anti-CD3 mAb treatment did not alter the capacity of CD4+ Treg cells to suppress effector T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) production in vitro. However, CD4+ Treg cells from both anti-CD3 mAb-treated and control mice were unable to suppress interleukin-17 (IL-17) production. In contrast, CD8+ Treg cells induced by anti-CD3 therapy suppressed IL-17 production as well as CD4+ T cell proliferation and IFNgamma production. CONCLUSION: These results show that anti-CD3 mAb treatment has important therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis and has the capacity to generate antiarthritic CD8+ Treg cells and expand the relative numbers of CD4+ Treg cells.",M2
20036238,"Head-up tilt lowers IOP and improves RGC dysfunction in glaucomatous <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.The inbred DBA/2J (D2) mouse strain is a well established model of spontaneously elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), progressive glaucomatous loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and early damage of RGC axons at the level of optic nerve head. Pattern electroretinogram (PERG) studies have shown that surviving RGCs in mice 6-12-month-old may be dysfunctional. RGC dysfunction seems to be IOP-dependent, since it may be exacerbated by means of acute IOP elevation with head-down body tilt. Here we test the hypothesis that head-up body posture lowers IOP, resulting in improvement of PERG amplitude in aged D2 mice with glaucoma. We show that head-up body tilt induces age-independent IOP lowering whose magnitude increases with the angle of tilt. For a fixed angle (-60 degrees ) of head-up tilt, IOP progressively decreases with a time constant of about 5 min and stabilizes at a value lower by about 5-6 mm Hg compared to the baseline. Head-up tilt also results in an improvement of PERG amplitude in older D2 mice with glaucoma but not in younger D2 mice without glaucoma. Improvement of PERG amplitude in aged D2 mice upon head-up-induced IOP lowering is consistent with the idea that RGCs undergo a stage of IOP-dependent, reversible dysfunction before death. The head-up IOP/PERG protocol may represent a non-invasive way to probe the potential for recovery of RGC dysfunction in D2 mice.",M2
20018491,"Abnormal serotonin receptor expression in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice associated with susceptibility to sudden death due to respiratory arrest.Previous studies indicate that DBA/2 mice may be a useful model of human sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), since these mice exhibit generalized convulsive seizures followed by respiratory arrest (RA). Respiratory deficits, following generalized convulsive seizures, are observed prior to SUDEP in patients. RA that occurs in DBA/2 mice following sound-induced seizures can be prevented by treatments that activate serotonin (5-HT) receptors. 5-HT receptor subtypes in brainstem respiratory centers are important in regulating normal respiration. The present study compared the expression of 5-HT subtype receptor proteins in excised brainstem tissue, containing the rostral ventral medulla respiratory region in DBA/2 mice vs. seizure-resistant C57BL/6J mice, using Western blot analysis. The results indicate that expression of specific 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), and 5-HT(4) receptor proteins in the brainstem tissue of DBA/2 mice is significantly diminished, while expression of the 5-HT(2B) receptors is significantly enhanced as compared to C57BL/6J mice. No difference in expression of 5-HT transporter protein is seen. These findings suggest that the DBA/2 mice are susceptible to RA, in part, because of the altered expression of 5-HT receptors. Preliminary studies indicate that 5-HT(2C) receptors may be particularly important, since a 5-HT(2C) agonist is very effective in blocking RA in DBA/2 mice.",M2
20013116,"Qualitative differences between C57BL/6J and <e>DBA</e>/2J mice in morphine potentiation of brain stimulation reward and intravenous self-administration.RATIONALE: The C57BL/6J (C57) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice are the most common genotypes used to identify chromosomal regions and neurochemical mechanisms of interest in opioid addiction. Unfortunately, outside of the oral two-bottle choice procedure, limited and sometimes controversial evidence is available for determining their relative sensitivity to the rewarding effects of morphine. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to utilize classically accepted models of drug abuse liability to determine relative susceptibility to the rewarding effects of morphine. METHODS: The ability of morphine or amphetamine to potentiate lateral hypothalamic brain stimulation and intravenous morphine self-administration (across three doses in a fixed ratio schedule and at the highest dose in progressive ratio schedules) was investigated in both genotypes. RESULTS: In both measures, C57 and DBA mice differed dramatically in their response to morphine. Morphine potentiated rewarding stimulation in the C57 mice but antagonized it in the DBA mice. Consistent with these findings, intravenous morphine did not serve as a positive reinforcer in DBA mice under conditions that were effective in the C57 mice using a fixed ratio schedule and failed to sustain levels of responding sufficient to maintain a constant rate of drug intake under a progressive ratio schedule. In contrast, amphetamine potentiated the rewarding effects of brain stimulation similarly in the two genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong evidence that morphine is rewarding in the C57 genotype and not in the DBA genotype. Understanding their relative susceptibility is important given the prominence of these genotypes in candidate gene identification and gene mapping.",M2

20004337,"Differential effects of free versus imposed motor activity on alcohol consumption in C57BL/6J versus <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.Practicing sport regularly provides obvious physiological and psychological benefits, but intensive sport activity, for example, at the competition level, may be associated with an increased risk for addictive disorder, whether to improve results (doping), to tolerate consequences of important pressure and physical activities (drugs), or developing as a substitute when stopping, definitely or temporally, this activity that has been considered as potentially addictive (conversion). An animal model of voluntary versus imposed physical activity is described in which males of two mouse strains with high (C57BL/6J) versus (DBA/2J) low alcohol preference were tested for possible modifications of alcohol consumption during and after physical activity, when the activity was forced versus when it was recreative. Free access to a running wheel allowed a moderate physical activity that was associated with a decrease in voluntary alcohol intake in C57BL/6J mice. On the one hand, forced running at a higher speed than that occurring under free conditions led to increased alcohol intake, back to the initial level. On the other hand, alcohol intake remained at the same low level whether or not DBA/2J mice were subjected to free or forced running. The only effect of forced running in these alcohol-avoiding mice was a significant desynchronization of circadian motor activity rhythm, which was even more pronounced than that induced in alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J mice. These results highlight the positive aspects of moderate and entertaining sport activity and provide further support to the idea that it can decrease spontaneous alcohol intake. They also tend to demonstrate that, at least for vulnerable subjects, forced and intensive activities may not have the same benefits regarding alcohol consumption.",M2

A body of evidence suggests that endogenous opioid peptide systems may influence rewarding effects of addictive substances, and thus, their individual expression levels may contribute to drug abuse liability. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to assess whether basal genotype-dependent brain expression of opioid propeptides genes can influence sensitivity to morphine reward. METHODS: Experiments were performed on inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J, <e>DBA</e>/2J, and SWR/J, which differ markedly in responses to morphine administration: DBA/2J and SWR/J show low and C57BL/6J high sensitivity to opioid reward. Proenkephalin (PENK) and prodynorphin (PDYN) gene expression was measured by in situ hybridization in brain regions implicated in addiction. The influence of the kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), which attenuates effects of endogenous PDYN-derived peptides, on rewarding actions of morphine was studied using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. RESULTS: DBA/2J and SWR/J mice showed higher levels of PDYN and lower levels of PENK messenger RNA in the nucleus accumbens than the C57BL/6J strain. Pretreatment with nor-BNI enhanced morphine-induced CPP in the opioid-insensitive DBA/2J and SWR/J strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that inter-strain differences in PENK and PDYN genes expression in the nucleus accumbens parallel sensitivity of the selected mouse strains to rewarding effects of morphine. They suggest that high expression of PDYN may protect against drug abuse by limiting drug-produced reward, which may be due to dynorphin-mediated modulation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.",M2
19997843,"Blockade of serotonin 2A receptors prevents PCP-induced attentional performance deficit and CREB phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum of <e>DBA</e>/2 mice.RATIONAL AND OBJECTIVE: Functional opposition between N-methyl-D-aspartate and 5-HT(2A) receptors may be a neural mechanism supporting cognitive functions. These systems converge on an intracellular signaling pathway that involves protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of different proteins including cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding (CREB). Thus, we tested whether selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, M100907, might abolish phencyclidine (PCP)-induced attentional performance deficit by preventing its effects on transduction mechanisms leading to CREB phosphorylation. METHODS: Using the five-choice serial reaction time task, the ability of subcutaneous injections of 2.5 and 10 microg/kg of M100907 to abolish the effects of an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg PCP on attentional performance as measured by accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and anticipatory and perseverative responding was assessed in DBA/2 mice. The effects of PCP, M100907, and their combination on S(133)-CREB and T(34)-DARPP32 phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of behaviorally naïve mice were examined using Western blotting technique. RESULTS: PCP reduced accuracy and increased anticipatory and perseverative responses as well as it increased S(133)-CREB phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum but not in the PFC. Ten microg/kg M100907 abolished the PCP-induced attentional performance deficits and the increase in S(133)-CREB but not T(34)-DARPP32 phosphorylation. By itself, M100907 had no effect on attentional performance or phospho-S(133)-CREB and phospho-T(34)-DARPP32. Interestingly, the effect of PCP on phospho-S(133)-CREB but not on phospho-T(34)-DARPP32 was dependent on endogenous 5-HT. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors may exert beneficial effects on cognitive deficits through a mechanism linked to striatal S(133)-CREB phosphorylation.",M2
19962916,"Articular cartilage imaging by the use of phase-contrast tomography in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the use of phase-contrast computed tomographic (CT) imaging for the identification of articular cartilage abnormalities of the knees in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arthritis was induced in nine male <e>DBA</e>/1 J mice by the intradermal injection of collagen. After 50 days, the nine mice were sacrificed, along with four mice that did not receive intradermal injections of collagen. Phase-contrast CT imaging using a microfocus x-ray source of the entire knee was performed. The images were evaluated by two blinded readers, and histopathologic grades were considered the reference standard. The phase-contrast CT images of cartilage were graded 0, I, or II. Evaluation of the grading agreement between the phase-contrast CT images and histopathologic findings was performed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: Phase-contrast CT images highly reflected the subchondral bone status in the assessment of articular cartilage abnormalities in the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Three-dimensional reformed images showed the articular surface and subchondral bony status of the knee joints. On the basis of the histopathology of the 26 knee joints, 12 joints were grade 0, six joints were grade I, and eight joints were grade II. Grading agreement between the use of the phase-contrast CT images and histopathologic results was high (r = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Phase-contrast CT imaging using a microfocus x-ray source offers a promising tool for the assessment of articular cartilage abnormalities of the knees in a mouse model.",M2
19937000,"Evidence of long-term expression of behavioral sensitization to both cocaine and ethanol in dopamine transporter knockout mice.INTRODUCTION: Locomotor sensitization, defined as the progressive and enduring enhancement of the motor stimulant effects elicited by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, is the consequence of drug-induced cellular neuroadaptations that likely contribute to addictive behavior. Neuroadaptations within the dopaminergic system have been shown to be involved both in the induction phase and in the long-term expression phase of sensitization upon drug readministration after withdrawal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT-KO) were used to test the effect of constitutive hyperdopaminergia on the durability of behavioral sensitization to both cocaine and ethanol. The effect of the DAT mutation was simultaneously tested on two inbred genetic backgrounds, C57Bl/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2, chosen for their contrasting addiction-related phenotypes, as well as on the hybrid F(1) offspring of a cross between C57Bl/6 and DBA/2 congenic strains. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In spite of the absence of the DAT, mutant mice were able to develop long-term expression of sensitization to cocaine. Compared to their wild-type littermates, DAT-KO mice exhibited a markedly increased acute ethanol-evoked locomotor activity and developed stronger behavioral sensitization to ethanol during both induction and long-term expression phases. Interestingly, this increased ethanol-induced sensitization was potentiated by the DBA/2 genetic background. CONCLUSION: These findings, showing that DAT deletion facilitates sensitization, suggest a cross-sensitization-like effect between genetic- and pharmacological-induced hyperdopaminergia.",M2
19933369,"Effect of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand on the reduction of joint inflammation in experimental rheumatoid arthritis.This study focused on the potential therapeutic effect of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and on the elucidation of the mechanisms involved. <e>DBA</e>/1J mice with established CIA were treated with various amount of recombinant soluble human TRAIL. The effects of TRAIL on the development and severity of CIA in this DBA/1J mouse model were assessed clinically and histologically, and a detailed investigation was conducted on proinflammatory cytokine and anticollagen-specific antibody levels. Cellular immunity was evaluated by investigating the proliferative responses and cytokine release profiles of splenocytes after TRAIL treatment. TRAIL treatment significantly reduced the severity and incidence of CIA, joint swelling, erythema, and edema. Histologic evaluations revealed that inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion were significantly reduced in joints of TRAIL-treated mice with dose-dependent manner. TRAIL treatment also strongly decreased and/or normalized the productions of proinflammatory cytokines and of anti-collagen-specific antibodies in the sera of CIA mice. Furthermore, in vitro studies with primary splenocytes showed the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL on activated lymphocytes, with reduction of inflammatory cytokine release. These findings show that TRAIL administration is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment that prevents the development and progression of CIA in DBA/1J mice, and they suggest that TRAIL might be considered a potential treatment for human RA.",M2
19930759,"A Thy1-CFP <e>DBA</e>/2J mouse line with cyan fluorescent protein expression in retinal ganglion cells.A DBA/2J (D2) transgenic mouse line with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) reporter expression in ganglion cells was developed for the analysis of ganglion cells during progressive glaucoma. The Thy1-CFP D2 (CFP-D2) line was created by congenically breeding the D2 line, which develops pigmentary glaucoma, and the Thy1-CFP line, which expresses CFP in ganglion cells. Microsatellite marker analysis of CFP-D2 progeny verified the genetic inclusion of the D2 isa and ipd loci. Specific mutations within these loci lead to dysfunctional melanosomal proteins and glaucomatous phenotype in D2 mice. Polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the inclusion of the Thy1-CFP transgene. CFP-fluorescent ganglion cells, 6-20 microm in diameter, were distributed in all retinal regions, CFP processes were throughout the inner plexiform layer, and CFP-fluorescent axons were in the fiber layer and optic nerve head. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to ganglion cell markers NF-L, NeuN, Brn3a, and SMI32 was used to confirm CFP expression in ganglion cells. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to amacrine cell markers HPC-1 and ChAT was used to confirm weak CFP expression in cholinergic amacrine cells. CFP-D2 mice developed a glaucomatous phenotype, including iris disease, ganglion cell loss, attrition of the fiber layer, and elevated intraocular pressure. A CFP-D2 transgenic line with CFP-expressing ganglion cells was developed, which has (1) a predominantly D2 genetic background, (2) CFP-expressing ganglion cells, and (3) age-related progressive glaucoma. This line will be of value for experimental studies investigating ganglion cells and their axons in vivo and in vitro during the progressive development of glaucoma.",M2

19906935,"Residues in the heptad repeat a region of the fusion protein modulate the virulence of Sendai virus in mice.While the molecular basis of fusion (F) protein refolding during membrane fusion has been studied extensively in vitro, little is known about the biological significance of membrane fusion activity in parainfluenza virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Two recombinant Sendai viruses, F-L179V and F-K180Q, were generated that contain F protein mutations in the heptad repeat A region of the ectodomain, a region of the protein known to regulate F protein activation. In vitro, the F-L179V virus caused increased syncytium formation (cell-cell membrane fusion) yet had a rate of replication and levels of F protein expression and cleavage similar to wild-type virus. The F-K180Q virus had a reduced replication rate along with reduced levels of F protein expression, cleavage, and fusogenicity. In <e>DBA</e>/2 mice, the hyperfusogenic F-L179V virus induced greater morbidity and mortality than wild-type virus, while the attenuated F-K180Q virus was much less pathogenic. During the first week of infection, virus replication and inflammation in the lungs were similar for wild-type and F-L179V viruses. After approximately 1 week of infection, the clearance of F-L179V virus was delayed, and more extensive interstitial inflammation and necrosis were observed in the lungs, affecting entire lobes of the lungs and having significantly greater numbers of syncytial cell masses in alveolar spaces on day 10. On the other hand, the slower-growing F-K180Q virus caused much less extensive inflammation than wild-type virus, presumably due to its reduced replication rate, and did not cause observable syncytium formation in the lungs. Overall, the results show that residues in the heptad repeat A region of the F protein modulate the virulence of Sendai virus in mice by influencing both the spread and clearance of the virus and the extent and severity of inflammation. An understanding of how the F protein contributes to infection and inflammation in vivo may assist in the development of antiviral therapies against respiratory paramyxoviruses.",M2
19906813,"The deletion variant of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) does not affect insulin secretion or glucose tolerance.The C57BL/6J (B6J) strain is the most widely used mouse strain in metabolic research. B6J mice produce a truncated form of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), an enzyme that pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been proposed that this results in B6J mice having reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance compared with other strains of mice (e.g. C3H/HeH and <e>DBA</e>/2) that have a full-length NNT. The aim of this study was to determine whether truncated NNT was associated with reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, comparing B6 substrains that differ in having a truncated NNT. C57BL/6N (B6N) mice have wild-type Nnt. We compared Nnt expression and activity levels as well as in vivo insulin secretion and glucose tolerance between these mice and B6J. Body weights and specific fat-pad depot masses were alike and Nnt expression and activity levels were similar between B6N and B6J mice. Glucose-mediated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were comparable between the two groups of mice, as were plasma glucose and insulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test. The presence of a truncated Nnt did not affect insulin secretion or glucose tolerance on the C57BL/6 background. We suggest that low or normal levels of NNT (regardless of truncation) have little effect on insulin secretion. Rather, it is the increase in expression of Nnt that regulates and enhances insulin secretion. Our data confirm that B6J is a reasonable control strain for diabetes research; this is especially important considering that it is the strain commonly used to generate genetically modified animals.",M2
19902105,"Mononuclear leukocytes from mice with resected tumor induce resistance to transplantation of tumor cells to animals.Experiments on male C57Bl/6 mice with intraperitoneally transplanted Ehrlich carcinoma and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice with subcutaneously transplanted S-91 melanoma showed that preliminary injection of mononuclear leukocytes obtained from animals 6-8 h after tumor resection induce resistance to transplantation of malignant transformed cells. Our results suggest that not only humoral factors, but also immunocompetent cells are involved in the regulation of tumor growth. The resistance to tumor transplantation was not induced by mononuclear leukocytes isolated over the first hours and 10-12 h after removal of the primary tumor node, which excludes the direct cytotoxic effect of these cells and suggests that this phenomenon is not associated with activation of the effector mechanisms for innate and adoptive immunity.",M2
19900268,"Altered peptide ligands inhibit arthritis induced by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase peptide.ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION: Immunosuppressants, including anti-TNFalpha antibodies, have remarkable effects in rheumatoid arthritis; however, they increase infectious events. The present study was designed to examine the effects and immunological change of action of altered peptide ligands (APLs) on glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) peptide-induced arthritis. METHODS: <e>DBA</e>/1 mice were immunized with hGPI325-339, and cells of draining lymph node (DLN) were stimulated with hGPI325-339 to investigate the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry. Twenty types of APLs with one amino acid substitution at a TCR contact site of hGPI325-339 were synthesized. CD4+ T cells primed with human GPI and antigen-presenting cells were co-cultured with each APL and cytokine production was measured by ELISA to identify antagonistic APLs. Antagonistic APLs were co-immunized with hGPI325-339 to investigate whether arthritis could be antigen-specifically inhibited by APL. After co-immunization, DLN cells were stimulated with hGPI325-339 or APL to investigate Th17 and regulatory T-cell population by flow cytometry, and anti-mouse GPI antibodies were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Human GPI325-339-specific Th17 cells showed predominant usage of TCRVbeta8.1 8.2. Among the 20 synthesized APLs, four (APL 6; N329S, APL 7; N329T, APL 12; G332A, APL 13; G332V) significantly reduced IL-17 production by CD4+ T cells in the presence of hGPI325-339. Co-immunization with each antagonistic APL markedly prevented the development of arthritis, especially APL 13 (G332V). Although co-immunization with APL did not affect the population of Th17 and regulatory T cells, the titers of anti-mouse GPI antibodies in mice co-immunized with APL were significantly lower than in those without APL. CONCLUSIONS: We prepared antagonistic APLs that antigen-specifically inhibited the development of experimental arthritis. Understanding the inhibitory mechanisms of APLs may pave the way for the development of novel therapies for arthritis induced by autoimmune responses to ubiquitous antigens.",M2
19853602,"The presence and distribution of elastin in the posterior and retrobulbar regions of the mouse eye.The Presence and distribution of elastin in the posterior and retrobulbar regions of the mouse eye was investigated. Mice of two strains (C57/BL6 and <e>DBA</e>/2J) were studied at 2 months and 8-12 months of age. Light, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy were used to identify elastin, using immunohistochemical techniques and ultrastructural evaluation. Elastin was found in the following ocular structures: conjunctiva, muscle tendons, sclera, choroid, and meninges. The elastin in the sclera was most dense in a ring surrounding the peripapillary optic nerve head, with its presence in the inner sclera declining with greater distance from the nerve head. Elastin fibers were oriented in the sclera along what would be expected to be the principal stress directions generated from the intraocular pressure, though actual biomechanical measurements have not yet been made in the mouse sclera. Elastin comprises a portion of the mouse sclera and its distribution in the peripapillary area is similar to that in human eyes.",M2
19845793,"Eosinophils infiltrate thyroids, but have no apparent role in induction or resolution of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in interferon-gamma(-/-) mice.Granulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (G-EAT) is induced by mouse thyroglobulin (MTg)-sensitized splenocytes activated with MTg and interleukin (IL)-12. Our previous studies showed that, when used as donors and recipients, interferon (IFN)-gamma(-/-) and wild-type (WT) <e>DBA</e>/1 mice both develop severe G-EAT. Thyroid lesions in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice have many eosinophils and few neutrophils, while those in WT mice have extensive neutrophil infiltration and few eosinophils. Thyroid lesions in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice consistently resolve by day 40-50, whereas those in WT mice have ongoing inflammation and fibrosis persisting for more than 60 days. To determine if the extensive infiltration of eosinophils in thyroids of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice contributes to thyroid damage and/or early resolution of G-EAT, anti-IL-5 was used to inhibit migration of eosinophils to thyroids. G-EAT severity was compared at day 20 and day 40-50 in IFN-gamma(-/-) recipients given anti-IL-5 or control immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thyroids of anti-IL-5-treated IFN-gamma(-/-) mice had few eosinophils and more neutrophils at day 20, but G-EAT severity scores were comparable to those of control IgG-treated mice at both day 20 and day 40-50. Expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) mRNA was higher and that of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11 (CCL11) mRNA was lower in thyroids of anti-IL-5-treated IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. IL-5 neutralization did not influence mRNA expression of most cytokines in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. Thus, inhibiting eosinophil migration to thyroids did not affect G-EAT severity or resolution in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, suggesting that eosinophil infiltration of thyroids occurs as a consequence of IFN-gamma deficiency, but these cells have no apparent pathogenic role in G-EAT.",M2
19815054,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes: slow down!--Can metabolic deceleration protect the islet beta cell from excess nutrient-induced damage?Islet beta-cell dysfunction is a characteristic and the main cause of hyperglycaemia of Type 2 diabetes. Understanding the mechanisms that cause beta-cell dysfunction will lead to better therapeutic outcomes for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Chronic fatty acid exposure of susceptible islet beta-cells causes dysfunction and death and this is associated with increased reactive oxygen species production leading to oxidative stress and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress. We present the hypothesis that metabolic deceleration can reduce both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and lead to improved beta-cell function and viability when exposed to a deleterious fat milieu. This is illustrated by the C57BL/6J mouse which is characterised by reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance associated with a mutation in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) but is resistant to obesity induced diabetes. On the other hand the <e>DBA</e>/2 mouse has comparatively higher insulin secretion and better glucose tolerance associated with increased Nnt activity but is susceptible to obesity-induced diabetes, possibly as a result of increased oxidative stress. We therefore suggest that in states of excess nutrient load, a reduced ability to metabolise this load may protect both the function and viability of beta-cells. Strategies that reduce metabolic flux when beta-cells are exposed to nutrient excess need to be considered when treating Type 2 diabetes.",M2
19811462,"PD-1 but not CTLA-4 blockage abrogates the protective effect of regulatory T cells in a pregnancy murine model.PROBLEM: Regulatory T cells (Treg) play an important role in fetal protection. They expand during normal pregnancy and protect paternal/fetal antigens from rejection by maternal effector cells. Accordingly, the transfer of Treg obtained from BALB/c-mated CBA/J females prevents abortion in <e>DBA</e>/2J-mated animals. The actual mechanism through which Treg mediate their protective effect is still inconclusive. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) are some of known Treg-associated molecules; however, their role in Treg-mediated fetal protection in murine model has not been investigated. METHOD OF STUDY: Treg obtained from normal pregnant animals (NP; CBA/J x BALB/c) on day 14 were adoptively transferred into abortion-prone mice (AP; CBA/J x DBA/2J) intravenously on day 2 of pregnancy. An amount of 250 microg of either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAb were injected intraperitoneally on days 0, 3, 6 and 9 of pregnancy. Controls received Treg + IgG or Treg + PBS. NP or AP treated with PBS served as additional controls. RESULTS: Blocking PD-1 abrogated the protective effect of Treg, resulting in a higher median abortion rate in comparison with the Treg/isotype-treated control while CTLA-4 blockage did not interfere with the protective effect of Treg. This was associated with a diminished number of vascular endothelial growth factor-A(+) cells, previously reported as stimulators of lymphocyte extravasation in preterm labor. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest PD-1 as an important mediator in Treg-induced fetal protection in the CBA/J x DBA/2J murine model.",M2
19801271,"Differential activation of limbic circuitry associated with chronic ethanol withdrawal in <e>DBA</e>/2J and C57BL/6J mice.Although no animal model exactly duplicates clinically defined alcoholism, models for specific factors, such as the withdrawal syndrome, are useful for identifying potential neural determinants of liability in humans. The well-documented difference in withdrawal severity following chronic ethanol exposure, between the DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mouse strains, provides an excellent starting point for dissecting the neural circuitry affecting predisposition to physical dependence on ethanol. To induce physical dependence, we used a paradigm in which mice were continuously exposed to ethanol vapor for 72h. Ethanol-exposed and air-exposed (control) mice received daily injections of pyrazole hydrochloride, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, to stabilize blood ethanol levels. Ethanol-dependent and air-exposed mice were killed 7h after removal from the inhalation chambers. This time point corresponds to the time of peak ethanol withdrawal severity. The brains were processed to assess neural activation associated with ethanol withdrawal indexed by c-Fos immunostaining. Ethanol-withdrawn DBA/2J mice showed significantly (P&lt;.05) greater neural activation than ethanol-withdrawn C57BL/6J mice in the dentate gyrus, hippocampus CA3, lateral septum, basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, and prelimbic cortex. Taken together with results using an acute model, our data suggest that progression from acute ethanol withdrawal to the more severe withdrawal associated with physical dependence following chronic ethanol exposure involves recruitment of neurons in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and prelimbic cortex. To our knowledge, these are the first studies to use c-Fos to identify the brain regions and neurocircuitry that distinguish between chronic and acute ethanol withdrawal severity using informative animal models.",M2
19788510,"Adoptive therapy by transfusing expanded donor murine natural killer T cells can suppress acute graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.BACKGROUND: Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) may suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic transplantation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of iNKT cells from major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donors for preventing GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In vitro, mouse iNKT cells were expanded with alpha-galactosylceramide and interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. In the NKT-treated group, lethally irradiated <e>DBA</e>/2(H-2K(d)) mice were adoptively transferred with expanded iNKT, bone marrow (BM), and spleen cells (SCs) from C57BL/6 (H-2K(b)) mice. Recipients in the control group were transferred only BM and SCs. The two groups were compared in survival, weight, histopathologic specimens, and serum cytokine analysis. RESULTS: In the iNKT-treated group, 80% of mice survived past Day 60 after BMT, but all died within 38 days in the control group. The mice treated with iNKT did not exhibit signs of GVHD after Day 42 except for a change in fur color. There were higher IL-4 levels by Day 7 in serum of mice that received iNKT compared to those without iNKT treatment, while the interferon-gamma levels showed no significant difference between two groups. Levels of IL-2 and IL-5 increased by Day 21 only in iNKT-treated mice. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that donor iNKT cells could alleviate GVHD symptoms and prolong survival after MHC-mismatched allogeneic BMT, which may be associated with the maintenance in IL-4 levels. These findings indicate that the therapy based on iNKT cells from MHC-mismatched donors has great potential in protection against GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",M2
19787337,"Motivational effects of opiates in conditioned place preference and aversion paradigm--a study in three inbred strains of mice.RATIONALE: Interstrain differences in the motivational properties of morphine and heroin have been previously reported in mice, suggesting the involvement of a genotype-dependent modulation of the rewarding effects of opiates. Yet, interstrain differences in the motivational effects of naloxone have not been described. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to examine genotype modulation of the motivational effects of opiates in inbred stains of mice with known, distinct, opiate-induced phenotypes, and morphine-induced striatal transcriptional responses. METHODS: We studied the rewarding properties of morphine (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg i.p.) and heroin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) in conditioned place preference (CPP) as well as the aversive properties of naloxone (1, 10, and 20 mg/kg i.p.) in the conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm in C57Bl/6J (C57), <e>DBA</e>/2J (DBA), and SWR/J (SWR) inbred strains of mice. RESULTS: Our results show that morphine and heroin as well as naloxone induce CPP and CPA, respectively, in a genotype- and dose-dependent manner in these studied inbred strains of mice. Interestingly, C57 mice are the most sensitive in the case of the rewarding properties of morphine and heroin but are the least sensitive to the aversive effects of naloxone, whereas the DBA strain exhibit the opposite behavioral effects. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that motivational homeostasis can be modulated by mu opioid receptors in mice, with the C57 mice representing a genotype that is more sensitive to processes related to rewards, whereas the genotype of DBA is more sensitive to aversion.",M2
19786508,"A possible mechanism for the decrease in serum thyroxine level by a 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl congener, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl in mice.Serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) levels were markedly decreased 7 days after treatment with 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB126) (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) in 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-sensitive C57BL/6 mice but not in TCDD-resistant <e>DBA</e>/2 mice. At the same time, the level and activity of hepatic T(4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (T(4)-UGT) were significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. Furthermore, the amounts of biliary [(125)I]T(4) and [(125)I]T(4) glucuronide after injection of [(125)I]T(4) were increased by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. Clearance of [(125)I]T(4) from serum was also promoted by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. On the other hand, no significant changes in the steady-state volumes of distribution of [(125)I]T(4) and in the concentration ratio (K(p) value) of the liver to serum by CB126 pretreatment were observed in either strain of mice. Because liver weight was increased by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice, hepatic total [(125)I]T(4) was increased only in C57BL/6 mice. The present findings indicate that CB126-mediated decrease in serum T(4) occurs through the increase in hepatic T(4)-UGT and the enhanced accumulation of hepatic T(4) along with development of liver hypertrophy.",M2
19776172,"The farnesoid X receptor modulates renal lipid metabolism and diet-induced renal inflammation, fibrosis, and proteinuria.Diet-induced obesity is associated with proteinuria and glomerular disease in humans and rodents. We have shown that in mice fed a high-fat diet, increased renal expression of the transcriptional factor sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) plays a critical role in renal lipid accumulation and increases the activity of proinflammatory cytokines and profibrotic growth factors. In the current study, we have determined a key role of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in modulating renal SREBP-1 activity, glomerular lesions, and proteinuria. We found that feeding a Western-style diet to <e>DBA</e>/2J mice results in proteinuria, podocyte loss, mesangial expansion, renal lipid accumulation, and increased expression of proinflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and profibrotic growth factors. Treatment of these mice with the highly selective and potent FXR-activating ligand 6-alpha-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (INT-747) ameliorates triglyceride accumulation by modulating fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, improves proteinuria, prevents podocyte loss, mesangial expansion, accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, and increased expression of profibrotic growth factors and fibrosis markers, and modulates inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results therefore indicate that FXR activation could represent an effective therapy for treatment of abnormal renal lipid metabolism with associated inflammation, oxidative stress, and kidney pathology in patients affected by obesity.",M2
19772788,"Multimodal optical and Gd-based nanoparticles for imaging in inflammatory arthritis.OBJECTIVES: This report documents a multimodal nanoparticle (MNP) contrast agent, containing embedded luminophores and surface-immobilized gadolinium chelates, as a contrast agent of inflamed synovium in a collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model. METHODS: <e>DBA</e>-1J mice were immunized for CIA and imaged after disease onset by two independent modalities. After intravenous administration of MNP contrast, optical and magnetic resonance images were obtained and clinical disease was scored, which was followed by processing of hindlimbs for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: We show a correlation between disease severity and MNP optical luminescence that is dose dependent. Immunofluorescence of hindlimb sections reveal that MNP-labeled cells are monocytes/macrophages within the inflamed synovium. Magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation time maps, which determine the quantitative measure of T1 and T2 values at each imaging voxel, demonstrated a decreasing T2 signal in actively inflamed joints that was more pronounced earlier rather than later during disease. CONCLUSIONS: MNPs containing surface-immobilized gadolinium chelates and embedded luminophores are potential dual-modality contrast agents in inflammatory arthritis and localize to monocytes/macrophages within inflamed synovium.",M2
19760280,"Electrophysiological deficits in the retina of the <e>DBA</e>/2J mouse.The DBA/2J (D2J) is a genetic mouse model for glaucomatous neurodegeneration because the animals develop anatomical and functional retinal deficits that partially can be correlated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The IOP starts to increase at an age of about 6 months as a result of morphological changes within the anterior eye segment, e.g., pigment dispersion and iris synechiae. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how ERG responses change in individuals at different ages in D2J mice and to compare these changes with normal aging effects in pigmented C57/B6 (B6) mice. IOP was measured in awake, non-sedated D2J and B6 mice with a rebound tonometer. At ages between 2-3 and 10 months, scotopic flash ERGs were measured five times with about 2 months' intervals. In addition, light adapted flicker ERGs were recorded. Our data show that the D2J shows lower flicker ERG responses than the B6 mice already at an age of 2-3 months. Dark adapted flash ERG responses are not decreased at this age. In both mouse strains the ERG responses decrease as a function of age, but there is a stronger decrease in the D2J mice. The data of flicker ERGs suggest the presence of early functional deficits in the D2J retina that possibly have a post-receptoral origin. The scotopic flash ERG reveals a functional deficit that occurs at a later stage and that possibly is IOP dependent. But, the deficits appear at an age at which the IOP is still lower than in the B6 mouse, indicating that other factors play an additional role.",M2
19752035,"Malaria ookinete surface protein-based vaccination via the intranasal route completely blocks parasite transmission in both passive and active vaccination regimens in a rodent model of malaria infection.Malaria vaccines based on ookinete surface proteins (OSPs) of the malaria parasites block oocyst development in feeding mosquitoes and hence disrupt the parasite life cycle and prevent the disease from being transmitted to other individuals. To investigate whether a noninvasive mucosal vaccination regimen effectively blocks parasite transmission in vivo, Plasmodium yoelii Pys25, a homolog of the Pfs25 and Pvs25 OSPs of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, respectively, was intranasally (i.n.) administered using a complement-deficient <e>DBA</e>/2 mouse malaria infection model, in which a highly elevated level of oocysts develops in feeding mosquitoes. Vaccinated mice developed a robust antibody response when the vaccine antigen was given together with cholera toxin adjuvant. The induced immune serum was passively transferred to DBA/2 mice 3 days after infection with P. yoelii 17XL, and Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to feed on the infected mice before or after serum transfusion. This passive immunization completely blocked oocyst development; however, immune serum induced by the antigen or adjuvant alone did not have such a profound antiparasite effect. Further, when i.n. vaccinated mice were infected with the parasite and then mosquitoes were allowed to directly feed on the infected mice, complete blockage of transmission was again observed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that mucosal vaccination has been demonstrated to be efficacious for directly preventing parasite transmission from vaccinated animals to mosquitoes, and the results may provide important insight into rational design of nonparenteral vaccines for use against human malaria.",M2
19751494,"alpha-Luminol prevents decreases in glutamate, glutathione, and glutamine synthetase in the retinas of glaucomatous <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that in DBA/2J mice, oxidative stress decreases glutamine synthetase (GS) levels resulting in a loss of neuronal glutamate and that the antioxidant alpha-luminol (GVT) decreases this stress and glutamate loss in some types of glaucoma. ANIMALS: DBA/2J mice were separated into two groups, of which one was not treated, and the other treated with GVT in the drinking water. At 7 months of age, retinas were examined from five untreated DBA/2J mice, seven GVT-treated mice, and five C57BL/6 mice (negative controls). METHODS: Serial 0.5 microm plastic sections were immunogold stained for glutamate, GS, and total glutathione, followed by image analysis for staining patterns and density. RESULTS: Focal decreases in glutamate immunostaining were common in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of DBA/2J retinas, but not in C57BL/6 or GVT-treated DBA/2J retinas. Decreases in glutathione and GS immunostaining were found in DBA/2J retinal regions where neuronal glutamate immunostaining was reduced. Retinas from GVT-treated DBA/2J had no significant decreases in INL levels of glutamate, glutathione, or GS. CONCLUSIONS: Retinas of dogs with primary glaucoma are reported to have focal depletion of neuronal glutamate. In DBA/2J mice, similar changes occur prior to the development of clinical disease. In these focal glutamate-depleted regions, levels of glutathione and GS are also reduced, consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to retinal changes in glaucoma. The ability of GVT, an antioxidant, to inhibit retinal abnormalities in DBA/2J mice provides further support for this hypothesis.",M2
19750107,"Dietary fat alters body composition, mammary development, and cytochrome p450 induction after maternal TCDD exposure in <e>DBA</e>/2J mice with low-responsive aryl hydrocarbon receptors.BACKGROUND: Increased fat intake is associated with obesity and may make obese individuals uniquely susceptible to the effects of lipophilic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the consequences of high-fat diet (HFD) and AHR ligands on body composition, mammary development, and hepatic P450 expression. METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) dams, respectively expressing high- or low-responsive AHR, were dosed at mid-gestation with TCDD. At parturition, mice were placed on an HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD). Body fat of progeny was measured before dosing with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Fasting blood glucose was measured, and liver and mammary glands were analyzed. RESULTS: Maternal TCDD exposure resulted in reduced litter size in D2 mice and, on HFD, reduced postpartum survival in B6 mice. In D2 mice, HFD increased body mass and fat in off-spring, induced precocious mammary gland development, and increased AHR expression compared with mice given an LFD. Maternal TCDD exposure increased hepatic Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 expression in offspring on both diets, but DMBA depressed Cyp1b1 expression only in mice fed an HFD. In D2 progeny, TCDD exposure decreased mammary terminal end bud size, and DMBA exposure decreased the number of terminal end buds. Only in D2 progeny fed HFD did perinatal TCDD increase blood glucose and the size of mammary fat pads, while decreasing both branch elongation and the number of terminal end buds. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that despite having a low-responsive AHR, D2 progeny fed a diet similar to that consumed by most people are susceptible to TCDD and DMBA exposure effects blood glucose levels, mammary differentiation, and hepatic Cyp1 expression.",M2
19743418,"Proteomic study of <e>DBA</e>/2J mice retina: Down-regulation of Integrin beta7 correlated with retinal ganglion cell death.To identify and determine the function of the proteins associated with the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in DBA/2J mice, an animal model of glaucoma, retinas of DBA/2J mice, were analyzed by proteomics at 5-, 7-, and 11-months-of-age. The proteins showing significant alterations were selected for identification by MS and 18 proteins were differentially expressed and the identified proteins included cell membrane receptors and proteins associated with intracellular signaling pathways. Among of identified proteins, the expression of Integrin beta7 at 7-months-of-age was decreased by about 89% of that at 5-months-of-age. Integrin beta7 was expressed in the RGCs. The effect of glutamate toxicity on the expression pattern of Integrin beta7 in a RGC line was also investigated and the glutamate-induced death of RGC was inhibited by the RNA knockdown of Integrin beta7. Our data showed also that the expression of 18 proteins in the DBA/2J was significantly altered in DBA2 mice and down-regulation of Integrin beta7 may have a protective effect on glutamate-induced death of RGCs.",M2
19737878,"Gene expression changes in areas of focal loss of retinal ganglion cells in the retina of <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.Purpose. To determine whether differences in gene expression occur between areas of focal retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and of relative RGC preservation in the DBA/2 mouse retina and whether they can provide insight into the pathophysiology of glaucoma. Methods. Areas of focal RGC loss (judged by lack of Fluorogold labeling; Fluorochrome, Denver, CO), adjacent areas with relative RGC preservation in DBA/2 retina, and Fluorogold-labeled retina from DBA/2(-pe) (pearl) mice were dissected and used for microarray analysis. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis were used to confirm differential gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify gene networks affected in the glaucomatous retina. Results. Microarray analysis identified 372 and 115 gene chip IDs as up- and downregulated, respectively, by 0.5-fold in areas of RGC loss. Differentially expressed genes included those coding for cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, transport proteins, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and immune response proteins. Several genes were confirmed by RT-PCR. For at least two genes, differential protein expression was verified. Bioinformatics analysis identified multiple affected functional gene networks. Pearl mice appeared to have significantly different gene expression, even when compared with relatively preserved areas of the DBA/2 retina. Conclusions. Regional gene expression changes occur in areas of focal RGC loss in the DBA/2 retina. The genes involved code for proteins with diverse cellular functions. Further investigation is needed to determine the cellular localization of the expression of these genes during the development of spontaneous glaucoma in the DBA/2 mouse and to determine whether some of these gene expression changes are causative or protective of RGC loss.",M2
19737532,"Natural killer T cells promote collagen-induced arthritis in <e>DBA</e>/1 mice.The role of NKT cells in the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) remains unclear since most studies have used C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which are less susceptible to CIA than mice with a DBA/1 background. To clarify the immunological functions of NKT cells in CIA, it is necessary to analyze in detail the effects of NKT cell deficiency on CIA development in DBA/1 mice. The incidence and severity of CIA were significantly exacerbated in DBA/1CD1d(+/-) mice as compared to DBA/1CD1d(-/-) mice. In DBA/1CD1d(+/-) mice, antigen-specific responses of B and T cells against CII were remarkably increased and inflammatory cytokine levels were also increased in vivo and in vitro. The number of IL-17-producing NKT cells significantly increased in DBA/1CD1d(+/-) mice as the disease progressed. Our results clearly show that NKT cells are involved not only in accelerating the severity and incidence of CIA but also in perpetuating the disease progression.",M2
19737139,"Reduced incidence and severity of experimental autoimmune arthritis in mice expressing catalytically inactive A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 8 (ADAM8).A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 8 (ADAM8), a catalytically active member of the ADAMs family of enzymes, is expressed primarily on immune cells and thus probably involved in inflammatory responses. ADAM8 is also produced by chondrocytes, and recombinant ADAM8 can induce cartilage catabolism. We therefore decided to test the role of ADAM8 in autoimmune inflammatory arthritis using transgenic mice expressing catalytically inactive ADAM8. Transgenic <e>DBA</e>/1J mice expressing an inactivating point mutation in the ADAM8 gene to change Glu330 to Gln330 (ADAM8(EQ)) were generated to evaluate the proteolytic function of ADAM8 in an lipopolysaccharide-synchronized collagen-induced arthritis (LPS-CIA) model of autoimmune arthritis. The systemic inflammatory reaction to LPS was also evaluated in these mice. Expression profiling of paw joints from wild-type mice revealed that ADAM8 mRNA levels increased at the onset of clinical arthritis and correlated well with cellular macrophage markers. When subjected to LPS-CIA, ADAM8(EQ) mice demonstrated decreased incidence and severity of clinical arthritis compared to wild-type mice. Histological examination of paw joints from ADAM8(EQ) mice confirmed marked attenuation of synovial inflammation, cartilage degradation and bone resorption when compared to wild-type mice. However, transgenic mice and wild-type mice responded similarly to LPS-induced systemic inflammation with regard to mortality, organ weights, neutrophil sequestration and serum cytokine/chemokine production. We conclude that ADAM8 proteolytic activity plays a key role in the development of experimental arthritis and may thus be an attractive target for the treatment of arthritic disorders while minimizing risk of immunocompromise.",M2
19735175,"Dietary vitamin E and quercetin modulate inflammatory responses of collagen-induced arthritis in mice.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial joints. This study investigated whether or not a diet deficient in vitamin E is a possible risk factor in the development of RA and evaluated the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation. Male <e>DBA</e>/1J mice were maintained on either a control diet (C) or a vitamin E-depleted (-VE) diet for 4 weeks before arthritis induction. The mice in the control group were subdivided into the control group (C/C), the 0.05% alpha-tocopherol-supplemented group (C/+VE), and the 0.5% quercetin-supplemented group (C/+Q). The vitamin E-depleted group was subdivided into the -VE group (-VE/-VE), the 0.05% alpha-tocopherol-supplemented group (-VE/+VE), and the 0.5% quercetin-supplemented group (-VE/+Q) (in total, six groups, 27 mice per group). The mice were maintained on the experimental diets for 9 weeks. Study results indicate that the -VE/-VE group showed higher joint tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta mRNA expressions, whereas alpha-tocopherol or quercetin supplementation reduced tissue cytokine mRNA levels to values comparable to those of the C/C group. The mice fed the -VE/-VE diet exhibited higher levels of circulating macrophage chemoattractant protein 1, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E(2) compared to those in other groups. Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or quercetin in mice fed -VE diet decreased these markers similar to those of the mice in the C/C group. No supplementation effect was observed, however, in the mice fed with the control diet prior to RA induction. These results suggest that dietary deficiency of vitamin E increases inflammatory responses and that antioxidants successfully suppress the inflammatory responses. However, significant clinical improvement may require longer observation.",M2
19733691,"Multigenic control of resistance to Sendai virus infection in mice.Experimental infection of mice with Sendai virus (SeV) is frequently used as a model of viral pathogenesis of human respiratory disease. To understand the differences in host response to SeV among mice strains, we carried out genetic mapping studies in <e>DBA</e>/2 (D2) (susceptible) and C57BL/6 (B6) (resistant) mice. F(1), F(2), and N(2) backcrossed mice were generated and examined for their disease resistance and susceptibility. For the determination of virulence, percentage body weight loss and survival time were used as phenotypes. We, then, carried out a genome wide scan on 108 backcrossed mice for linkage with percentage body weight loss as phenotype. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) showing significant linkage was mapped to the distal portion of Chr 4 (SeV1). In addition, two other QTLs showing suggestive statistical linkage were also detected on Chr 8 and 14. We, further, performed genome scan for interactions with least squares analysis of variance of all pairs of informative makers in backcrossed progenies. We identified a highly significant epistatic interaction between D3Mit182 and D14Mit10, then denoted as SeV2 and SeV3, respectively, and the latter was the same locus showing a suggestive level on Chr 14 in QTL analysis. Considered genotypes of these three loci, we could account for more than 90% of genetic effect on the differential response to SeV infection between B6 and D2 mice. These findings revealed a novel gene interactions controlling SeV resistance in mice and will enable the identification of resistance genes encoded within these loci.",M2
19729078,"A highly branched 1,3-beta-D-glucan extracted from Aureobasidium pullulans induces cytokine production in <e>DBA</e>/2 mouse-derived splenocytes.We recently elucidated the structure of a highly branched 1,3-beta-D-glucan with 6-monoglucopyranosyl side chains, extracted from Aureobasidium pullulans (AP-FBG). Although the biological effects of beta-D-glucans are known to depend on their structures, the effects of a highly branched 1,3-beta-D-glucan on the production of cytokines by leukocytes in mice have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that AP-FBG strongly induced the production of various cytokines, especially Th1 cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma and IL-12p70) and Th17 cytokines (e.g., IL-17A), but did not induce the production of IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in DBA/2 mouse-derived splenocytes in vitro.",M2
19728991,"Ondansetron results in improved auditory gating in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice through a cholinergic mechanism.The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron, has been shown to correct the auditory gating deficit in medicated schizophrenia patients. Inhibition of 5-HT(3) receptors releases acetylcholine, the endogenous ligand for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The schizophrenia-related auditory gating deficit is modulated, in part, by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as is the mouse (DBA/2) model of the deficit. The present study assessed the effects of both acute and chronically administered ondansetron on auditory gating in DBA/2 mice. Auditory gating is defined as a decrease in amplitude of response to the second of a paired identical auditory stimulus presented 0.5 s following an initial auditory stimulus. Acute ondansetron administration at the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg, IP) tested had no effect, while other doses (0.33 and 1 mg/kg, IP) produced improvements in auditory gating. The improvements were produced through both an increase in response to the first auditory stimulus and a decrease in the response to the second auditory stimulus. Co-administration of an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, alpha-bungarotoxin, or the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine, with the 0.33 mg/kg dose of ondansetron blocked the improvement in auditory gating produced by ondansetron alone. There was no difference in response between the chronically injected mice and naive mice. Both showed improved auditory gating, thus, demonstrating no  carry over  effect of daily injections. These data demonstrate that indirect stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by ondansetron can improve auditory gating parameters in DBA/2 mice.",M2
19723321,"Dichloroacetate alleviates development of collagen II-induced arthritis in female <e>DBA</e>/1 mice.INTRODUCTION: Dichloroacetate (DCA) has been in clinical use for the treatment of lactacidosis and inherited mitochondrial disorders. It has potent anti-tumor effects both in vivo and in vitro, facilitating apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. The pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative properties of DCA prompted us to investigate the effects of this compound in arthritis. METHODS: In the present study, we used DCA to treat murine collagen type II (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA), an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis. DBA/1 mice were treated with DCA given in drinking water. RESULTS: Mice treated with DCA displayed much slower onset of CIA and significantly lower severity (P &lt; 0.0001) and much lower frequency (36% in DCA group vs. 86% in control group) of arthritis. Also, cartilage and joint destruction was significantly decreased following DCA treatment (P = 0.005). Moreover, DCA prevented arthritis-induced cortical bone mineral loss. This clinical picture was also reflected by lower levels of anti-CII antibodies in DCA-treated versus control mice, indicating that DCA affected the humoral response. In contrast, DCA had no effect on T cell- or granulocyte-mediated responses. The beneficial effect of DCA was present in female DBA/1 mice only. This was due in part to the effect of estrogen, since ovariectomized mice did not benefit from DCA treatment to the same extent as sham-operated controls (day 30, 38.7% of ovarectomized mice had arthritis vs. only 3.4% in sham-operated group). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that DCA delays the onset and alleviates the progression of CIA in an estrogen-dependent manner.",M2
19714650,"Induction of apoptosis in the synovium of mice with autoantibody-mediated arthritis by the intraarticular injection of double-stranded MicroRNA-15a.OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA is a family of noncoding RNAs that exhibit tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific expression patterns and are associated with human diseases. MicroRNA-15a (miR-15a) is reported to induce cell apoptosis by negatively regulating the expression of Bcl-2, which suppresses the apoptotic processes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether double-stranded miR-15a administered by intraarticular injection could be taken up by cells and could induce Bcl-2 dysfunction and cell apoptosis in the synovium of arthritic mice in vivo. METHODS: Autoantibody-mediated arthritis was induced in male <e>DBA</e>/1J mice. In the experimental group, double-stranded miR-15a labeled with FAM-atelocollagen complex was injected into the knee joint. In the control group, control small interfering RNA-atelocollagen complex was injected into the knee joint. Synovial expression of miR-15a was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, FAM by fluorescence microscopy, Bcl-2 by Western blotting, and Bcl-2 and caspase 3 by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of miR-15a in the synovium of the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group. Green fluorescence emission of FAM was observed in the synovium of the experimental group. Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated and the expression of caspase 3 was increased as compared with that in the control group. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the induction of cell apoptosis after intraarticular injection of double-stranded miR-15a occurs through inhibition of the translation of Bcl-2 protein in arthritic synovium.",M2
19714646,"Liver X receptor agonism promotes articular inflammation in murine collagen-induced arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Liver X receptors (LXRs) have previously been implicated in the regulation of inflammation and have, in general, been ascribed an antiinflammatory role. This study was therefore undertaken to explore the biologic mechanisms of LXRs in vivo and in vitro in an experimental inflammatory arthritis model. METHODS: Male <e>DBA</e>/1 mice were immunized with type II collagen and treated from an early or established stage of arthritis with 2 different concentrations of the LXR agonists T1317 and GW3965 or vehicle control. The mice were monitored for articular inflammation and cartilage degradation by scoring for clinical signs of arthritis, histologic examination of the joints, and analysis of serum cytokine and antibody levels. In vitro, primary human monocytes and T cells were cultured in the presence of GW3965 or T1317, and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were measured by multiplex assay. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, LXR agonism with the use of 2 discrete, specific molecular entities led to substantial exacerbation of articular inflammation and cartilage destruction in this murine collagen-induced arthritis model. This was associated ex vivo with elevated cytokine expression, with enhanced Th1 and Th17 cellular responses, and with elevated collagen-specific autoantibody production. In vitro, LXR agonists, in concert with lipopolysaccharide, promoted cytokine and chemokine release from human monocytes, and similar effects were observed in a T cell-macrophage coculture model that closely recapitulates the pathways that drive synovial cytokine release. CONCLUSION: Since LXRs are present in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium, these results suggest that LXR-mediated pathways could exacerbate the chronic inflammatory response typical of RA.",M2
19706712,"Host genetic variation affects resistance to infection with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus in mice.Despite the prevalence of H5N1 influenza viruses in global avian populations, comparatively few cases have been diagnosed in humans. Although viral factors almost certainly play a role in limiting human infection and disease, host genetics most likely contribute substantially. To model host factors in the context of influenza virus infection, we determined the lethal dose of a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/213/03) in C57BL/6J and <e>DBA</e>/2J mice and identified genetic elements associated with survival after infection. The lethal dose in these hosts varied by 4 logs and was associated with differences in replication kinetics and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines CCL2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in susceptible DBA/2J mice. Gene mapping with recombinant inbred BXD strains revealed five loci or Qivr (quantitative trait loci for influenza virus resistance) located on chromosomes 2, 7, 11, 15, and 17 associated with resistance to H5N1 virus. In conjunction with gene expression profiling, we identified a number of candidate susceptibility genes. One of the validated genes, the hemolytic complement gene, affected virus titer 7 days after infection. We conclude that H5N1 influenza virus-induced pathology is affected by a complex and multigenic host component.",M2
19706490,"Heme oxygenase-1 affords protection against noncerebral forms of severe malaria.Infection by Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is associated with hemolysis and therefore with release of hemoglobin from RBC. Under inflammatory conditions, cell-free hemoglobin can be oxidized, releasing its heme prosthetic groups and producing deleterious free heme. Here we demonstrate that survival of a Plasmodium-infected host relies strictly on its ability to prevent the cytotoxic effects of free heme via the expression of the heme-catabolyzing enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; encoded by the Hmox1 gene). When infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc), wild-type (Hmox1(+/+)) BALB/c mice resolved infection and restored homeostasis thereafter (0% lethality). In contrast, HO-1 deficient (Hmox1(-/-)) BALB/c mice developed a lethal form of hepatic failure (100% lethality), similar to the one occurring in Pcc-infected <e>DBA</e>/2 mice (75% lethality). Expression of HO-1 suppresses the pro-oxidant effects of free heme, preventing it from sensitizing hepatocytes to undergo TNF-mediated programmed cell death by apoptosis. This cytoprotective effect, which inhibits the development of hepatic failure in Pcc-infected mice without interfering with pathogen burden, is mimicked by pharmacological antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). When administered therapeutically, i.e., after Pcc infection, NAC suppressed the development of hepatic failure in Pcc-infected DBA/2 mice (0% lethality), without interfering with pathogen burden. In conclusion, we describe a mechanism of host defense against Plasmodium infection, based on tissue cytoprotection against free heme and limiting disease severity irrespectively of parasite burden.",M2
19686600,"High throughput sequencing in mice: a platform comparison identifies a preponderance of cryptic SNPs.BACKGROUND: Allelic variation is the cornerstone of genetically determined differences in gene expression, gene product structure, physiology, and behavior. However, allelic variation, particularly cryptic (unknown or not annotated) variation, is problematic for follow up analyses. Polymorphisms result in a high incidence of false positive and false negative results in hybridization based analyses and hinder the identification of the true variation underlying genetically determined differences in physiology and behavior. Given the proliferation of mouse genetic models (e.g., knockout models, selectively bred lines, heterogeneous stocks derived from standard inbred strains and wild mice) and the wealth of gene expression microarray and phenotypic studies using genetic models, the impact of naturally-occurring polymorphisms on these data is critical. With the advent of next-generation, high-throughput sequencing, we are now in a position to determine to what extent polymorphisms are currently cryptic in such models and their impact on downstream analyses. RESULTS: We sequenced the two most commonly used inbred mouse strains, <e>DBA</e>/2J and C57BL/6J, across a region of chromosome 1 (171.6 - 174.6 megabases) using two next generation high-throughput sequencing platforms: Applied Biosystems (SOLiD) and Illumina (Genome Analyzer). Using the same templates on both platforms, we compared realignments and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection with an 80 fold average read depth across platforms and samples. While public datasets currently annotate 4,527 SNPs between the two strains in this interval, thorough high-throughput sequencing identified a total of 11,824 SNPs in the interval, including 7,663 new SNPs. Furthermore, we confirmed 40 missense SNPs and discovered 36 new missense SNPs. CONCLUSION: Comparisons utilizing even two of the best characterized mouse genetic models, DBA/2J and C57BL/6J, indicate that more than half of naturally-occurring SNPs remain cryptic. The magnitude of this problem is compounded when using more divergent or poorly annotated genetic models. This warrants full genomic sequencing of the mouse strains used as genetic models.",M2
19671657,"Effects of atherogenic diet on hepatic gene expression across mouse strains.Diets high in fat and cholesterol are associated with increased obesity and metabolic disease in mice and humans. To study the molecular basis of the metabolic response to dietary fat, 10 inbred strains of mice were fed atherogenic high-fat and control low-fat diets. Liver gene expression and whole animal phenotypes were measured and analyzed in both sexes. The effects of diet, strain, and sex on gene expression were determined irrespective of complex processes, such as feedback mechanisms, that could have mediated the genomic responses. Global gene expression analyses demonstrated that animals of the same strain and sex have similar transcriptional profiles on a low-fat diet, but strains may show considerable variability in response to high-fat diet. Functional profiling indicated that high-fat feeding induced genes in the immune response, indicating liver damage, and repressed cholesterol biosynthesis. The physiological significance of the transcriptional changes was confirmed by a correlation analysis of transcript levels with whole animal phenotypes. The results found here were used to confirm a previously identified quantitative trait locus on chromosome 17 identified in males fed a high-fat diet in two crosses, PERA x <e>DBA</e>/2 and PERA x I/Ln. The gene expression data and phenotype data have been made publicly available as an online tool for exploring the effects of atherogenic diet in inbred mouse strains (http://cgd-array.jax.org/DietStrainSurvey).",M2
19671078,"Genetic architecture for hole-board behaviors across substantial time intervals in young, middle-aged and old mice.A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of behaviors across the life span was conducted in F(2) mice from a C57BL/6J x <e>DBA</e>/2J cross and 22 BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Mice of three age groups were tested in a hole-board apparatus for 3 min on three occasions approximately 1 month apart (average age at test 150, 450 and 750 days, approximately 400 mice per group, divided equally by sex). Quantitative trait loci with small effect size were found on 11 chromosomes for hole-board activity (Hbact) and hole-board rearing (Hbrear). Analysis of 22 RI strains tested at 150 and 450 days of age found only suggestive linkage, with four QTL for Hbact overlapping with those from the F(2) analysis. There was a significant phenotypic correlation between Hbact and Hbrear (approximately 0.55-0.69) and substantial commonality among QTL for the two behaviors. QTL analyses of head-pokes (HP) and fecal boli (FB) only identified QTL at the suggestive level of significance. Age accounted for approximately 15% of the phenotypic variance (sex approximately 3%), and there were genotype by age interactions at approximately 25% of the Hbact and Hbrear QTL. Quantitative trait loci for Hbrear were relatively stable across the three measurement occasions (those for Hbact somewhat less so), although mean levels of each index declined markedly comparing the first to subsequent trials. Considered as a whole, the polygenic system influencing exploratory behaviors accounts for approximately the same amount of phenotypic variance as age (within the range studied), is stable across substantial periods of time, and acts, for the most part, independently of age and sex.",M2
19662386,"A functional role for the dopamine D3 receptor in the induction and expression of behavioural sensitization to ethanol in mice.RATIONALE: We previously reported that mice lacking dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) were resistant to behavioural sensitization to ethanol (EtOH). Since knockout mice have permanent receptor inactivation, we investigated how temporary pharmacological blockade and activation of D3Rs affected the induction or expression of EtOH sensitization. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In induction studies, <e>DBA</e>/2 mice received 0, 10 or 75 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.) of the D3R antagonist, U99194A ,before each of seven EtOH (2.2 g/kg, intraperitoneal) or saline injections. Locomotor activity (LMA) was assessed in activity chambers. In expression studies, mice received seven injections of EtOH or saline, followed 14 days later with U99194A or vehicle immediately before a test dose of EtOH (1.8 g/kg). In separate experiments, the effects of the D3R agonist PD128907 (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) were similarly examined during and after EtOH sensitization. RESULTS: Chronic co-administration of low-dose U99194A blocked the induction of EtOH sensitization, while acute U99194A had no effect in mice that were already sensitized. Chronic co-administration of PD128907 resulted in decreased LMA but this effect was also seen in saline-treated mice, suggesting a simple subtractive effect. In previously sensitized mice, acute PD128907 significantly attenuated the expression of EtOH sensitization, indicating an enhanced response to the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a modulatory role for the D3R in behavioural sensitization to EtOH, where D3R blockade is associated with induction and D3R stimulation is associated with expression of EtOH sensitization. A model is suggested to account for these complementary functions of the D3R at different stages of EtOH sensitization.",M2
19661122,"Effects of ooplasm transfer on paternal genome function in mice.BACKGROUND: The ooplasm plays a central role in forming the paternal pronucleus, and subsequently in regulating the expression of paternally inherited chromosomes. Previous studies in mice have revealed genetic differences in paternal genome processing by ooplasm of different genotypes. Ooplasm donation coupled to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been used in human assisted reproductive technology (ART). This procedure exposes the developing paternal pronucleus to 'foreign' ooplasm, which may direct aberrant epigenetic processing. The potential effects of the foreign ooplasm on epigenetic information in the paternal pronucleus are unknown; however, some human progeny from ooplasm donation procedures display abnormalities. METHODS: In this study, we employed inter-genotype ooplasm transfer followed by ICSI using two mouse strains, C57BL/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2, to explore the influence of foreign ooplasm on paternal pronucleus function. In order to assay for effects on the paternal genome without masking effects of the maternal genome, we examined ooplasm effects in diploid androgenones, which are produced by pronuclear transfer to contain exclusively two paternal sets of chromosomes, in combination with ICSI. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of intra-strain ooplasm transfer among androgenones made with either C57BL/6 or DBA/2 oocytes. There was a significant negative effect on androgenone blastocyst development with inter-genotype transfer (10% volume) of DBA/2 ooplasm to C57BL/6 oocytes (P &lt; 0.05). The reciprocal inter-genotype ooplasm transfer had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, inter-genotype ooplasm transfer in conjunction with ICSI can alter the function of the paternal genome. However, the effect of foreign ooplasm is restricted to a negative effect, with no evidence of a positive effect. This study provides important new information about the possible consequences of ooplasm donation in human ART.",M2
19660107,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced adipose-related protein expression in experimental arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis.ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) plays a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the mechanism of action of TNFalpha antagonists in RA is poorly defined. Immunization of <e>DBA</e>/1 mice with glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) induces severe acute arthritis. This arthritis can be controlled by TNFalpha antagonists, suggesting similar etiology to RA. In this study, we explored TNFalpha-related mechanisms of arthritis. METHODS : First, we performed GeneChip analysis using splenocytes of mice with GPI-induced arthritis. Expression of TNFalpha-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP) mRNA and protein in spleens, joints and lymph nodes was evaluated, and fluctuation of TIARP mRNA was analyzed after administration of anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody (mAb). Localization of TIARP in spleen and joints was also explored. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) families of proteins, the human ortholog of TIARP gene, were also evaluated in human peripheral blood mononucleocytes and synovium. RESULTS : Among the arrayed TNFalpha-related genes, the expression of TIARP mRNA was the highest (more than 20 times the control). TIARP mRNA was detected specifically in joints and spleens of arthritic mice, and their levels in the synovia correlated with severity of joint swelling. Treatment with anti-TNF mAb significantly reduced TIARP mRNA expression in splenocytes. Among the splenocytes, CD11b+ cells were the main source of TIARP mRNA. Immunohistochemistry showed that TIARP protein was mainly localized in hyperplastic synovium. Among the STEAP family of proteins, STEAP4 was highly upregulated in joints of patients with RA and especially co-localized with CD68+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS : The results shed light on the new mechanism of action of TNFalpha antagonists in autoimmune arthritis, suggesting that TIARP plays an important role in inflammatory arthritis, through the regulation of inflammatory cytokines.",M2
19643015,"Differential response of C57BL/6J mouse and <e>DBA</e>/2J mouse to optic nerve crush.BACKGROUND: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is the final consequence of many blinding diseases, where there is considerable variation in the time course and severity of RGC loss. Indeed, this process appears to be influenced by a wide variety of genetic and environmental factors. In this study we explored the genetic basis for differences in ganglion cell death in two inbred strains of mice. RESULTS: We found that RGCs are more susceptible to death following optic nerve crush in C57BL/6J mice (54% survival) than in DBA/2J mice (62% survival). Using the Illumina Mouse-6 microarray, we identified 1,580 genes with significant change in expression following optic nerve crush in these two strains of mice. Our analysis of the changes occurring after optic nerve crush demonstrated that the greatest amount of change (44% of the variance) was due to the injury itself. This included changes associated with ganglion cell death, reactive gliosis, and abortive regeneration. The second pattern of gene changes (23% of the variance) was primarily related to differences in gene expressions observed between the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mouse strains. The remaining changes in gene expression represent interactions between the effects of optic nerve crush and the genetic background of the mouse. We extracted one genetic network from this dataset that appears to be related to tissue remodeling. One of the most intriguing sets of changes included members of the crystallin family of genes, which may represent a signature of pathways modulating the susceptibility of cells to death. CONCLUSION: Differential responses to optic nerve crush between two widely used strains of mice were used to define molecular networks associated with ganglion cell death and reactive gliosis. These results form the basis for our continuing interest in the modifiers of retinal injury.",M2
19641932,"Ultrastructural analysis of the pigment dispersion syndrome in <e>DBA</e>/2J mice.PURPOSE: To characterise ocular pigment abnormalities associated with iris atrophy in DBA/2J mice as a model for human pigment dispersion syndrome. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, electron and light microscopy were performed to examine the eyes of DBA/2J mice ranging in age from 2.5 to 18 months old. The focus of our study was the description of the ultrastructural modifications in the irides of DBA/2J mice. RESULTS: The DBA/2J mice presented modifications in the melanosomes in all the pigmented parts of the eye, including the retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal melanocytes of the ciliary pigment epithelium. The extracellular matrix of the iris stroma disappeared with ageing. Pigmented cells detached from the iris and migrated into the trabecular meshwork exclusively on the anterior iris surface. These cells were identified as macrophages by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. There was no evidence that melanocytes or iris pigment epithelial cells migrated into the trabecular meshwork, but they became more and more depigmented. The aqueous outflow was blocked by pigment-laden cells, but not by cellular debris or melanosomes. No substantial amount of extracellular melanosomes was observed. CONCLUSION: The morphology of melanosomes is aberrant in all pigment cells in the eyes of DBA/2J mice. We conclude that the disease process begins with the transfer of both immature melanosomes from the iris pigment epithelium (IPE) and melanocytes to macrophages, which subsequently migrate into the trabecular meshwork. Accumulating macrophages cause a blockade of the chamber angle. As the disease progresses, the IPE, melanocytes and iris stroma, including blood vessels, disappear, leading to iris atrophy. It is speculated that the loss of these pigment cells is partly caused by reduction of the iris stroma.",M2
19640302,"Immunization with an immunodominant self-peptide derived from glucose-6-phosphate isomerase induces arthritis in <e>DBA</e>/1 mice.INTRODUCTION: T-helper (Th) lymphocytes are critically required for the pathogenesis of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI)-induced arthritis, but neither the G6PI epitopes recognized by arthritogenic T cells nor their pathogenic effector functions have been fully elucidated to date. We aimed at identifying arthritogenic G6PI peptides. METHODS: We used a library of overlapping peptides spanning the entire G6PI sequence to identify the epitopes recognized by G6PI-specific Th cells. Immunodominant peptides were then used to immunize mice. Arthritis development was evaluated clinically and histologically. The humoral and cellular immune responses upon peptide immunization were analyzed by ELISA and multiparameter flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: We identified six immunodominant T-cell epitopes in DBA/1 mice, of which three are arthritogenic. One of these peptides (G6PI469-483) is identical in man and mice. Immunization with this peptide induces arthritis, which is less severe and of shorter duration than arthritis induced by immunization with full-length G6PI. Upon immunization with either G6PI or peptide, the antigen-specific Th cells produce IL-17, RANKL, IFNgamma and TNFalpha. CONCLUSIONS: We identified immunodominant and arthritogenic epitopes of G6PI. Not all immunodominant peptides are arthritogenic. This is the first description of arthritis induced by immunization with a self-peptide in mice.",M2
19638432,"Comparative study on susceptibility to 1-bromopropane in three mice strains.Previous studies indicate that 1-bromopropane (1BP) has neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity both in humans and animals. The present study investigated strain differences in susceptibility to 1BP and identified possible biological factors that determine such susceptibility. Twenty-four male mice of each of the three strains (C57BL/6J, <e>DBA</e>/2J, and BALB/cA) were divided into four groups of six each and exposed to 1BP at 0, 50, 110, and 250 ppm for 8 h/day for 28 days by inhalation. At the end of exposure period, the relative susceptibilities of each strain to 1BP-mediated hepatotoxicity and male reproductive toxicity were evaluated. The contributing factors to strain-dependent susceptibility were assessed by determination of hepatic CYP2E1 levels, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione (GSH) status, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA levels. Liver histopathology showed significantly larger area of liver necrosis and more degenerative lobules in BALB/cA in the order of BALB/cA &gt; C57BL/6J &gt; DBA/2J. BALB/cA showed higher CYP2E1 protein level and lower total GSH content and GST activity in the liver than DBA/2J. These results indicate that BALB/cA mice are the most susceptible to hepatotoxicity of 1BP among the three strains tested, and that CYP2E1, GSH level/GST activity may contribute to the susceptibility to 1BP hepatotoxicity. Exposure to &gt; or = 50 ppm of 1BP also decreased sperm count and sperm motility and increased sperms with abnormal heads in all three strains mice in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison with previous studies in rats indicates that mice are far more susceptible than rats to 1BP regarding hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity.",M2
19619567,"Repeatability of exercise behaviors in mice.PURPOSE: Measurements of exercise behaviors in rodents such as maximal treadmill endurance and physical activity are often used in the literature; however, minimal data are available regarding the repeatability of measurements used for these exercise behaviors. This study assessed the repeatability of a commonly used maximal exercise endurance treadmill test as well as voluntary physical activity measured by wheel running in mice. METHODS: Repeatability of treadmill tests were analyzed for both inbred and outbred mice in addition to a 10 week repeatability analysis using Balb/cJ mice (n=20). Voluntary daily physical activity was assessed by distance, duration, and speed of wheel running (WR). Physical activity measurements on days 5 and 6 of WR in a large cohort (n=739) of both inbred and outbred mice were compared. RESULTS: No significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in exercise endurance were found between different cohorts of Balb/cJ and <e>DBA</e>/2J mice indicating strains overall generally test the same; however, significant differences between tests were seen within BaD2F(2) animals (p&lt;0.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a lack of agreement between weekly endurance tests within mouse, and correlation analysis showed lack of consistent correlations between weekly endurance tests within mouse. No significant differences were found for WR measurements within mouse between days (p=0.99). High correlations between days within mouse for WR were found (r=0.74-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: High intra-mouse variability between repeated endurance tests suggests that treadmill testing in an enclosed chamber with shock grid for motivation to run in mice is not repeatable. Conversely, high correlation and agreement between days of wheel-running measurements suggest that voluntary activity (WR) is repeatable and stable within individual mice.",M2
19619563,"Characterization of pharmacological and behavioral differences to nicotine in C57Bl/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice.Approximately 50-70% of the risk for developing nicotine dependence is attributed to genetics; therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the genetic mechanisms involved in nicotine reinforcement and dependence in hopes of generating better smoking cessation therapies. The overall goal of these studies was to characterize behavioral and pharmacological responses to nicotine in C57Bl/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice, two inbred strains commonly used for genetic studies on behavioral traits. B6 and D2 mice where subjected to a battery of behavioral tests to measure nicotine's acute effects, calcium-mediated antinociceptive responses, tolerance to chronic treatment with osmotic mini pumps, and following three days of nicotine withdrawal. In general, D2 mice were less sensitive than B6 mice to the acute effects of nicotine, but were more sensitive to blockade of nicotine-induced antinociceptive responses by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor. B6, but not D2 mice, developed tolerance to nicotine and nicotine conditioned place preference (CPP). While B6 and D2 mice both expressed some physical withdrawal signs, affective withdrawal signs were not evident in D2 mice. These results provide a thorough, simultaneous evaluation of the pharmacological and behavioral differences to experimenter-administered nicotine as measured in several behavioral tests of aspects that contribute to smoking behavior. The B6 and D2 strains show wide phenotypic differences in their responses to acute or chronic nicotine. These results suggest that these strains may be useful progenitors for future genetic studies on nicotine behaviors across batteries of mouse lines such as the BXD recombinant inbred panel.",M2
19607953,"Cynomolgus macaques immunized with two HIV-1 Tat stabilized proteins raise strong and long-lasting immune responses with a pattern of Th1/Th2 response differing from that in mice.The transcriptional transactivator (Tat) of HIV-1 is regarded as an attractive target for the development of an AIDS vaccine. However, investigations have suggested that Tat is poorly immunogenic and prompted us to develop a strategy to increase its ability to raise an immune response. The strategy is based on stabilization of Tat using sulfated sugars, previously proven to boost its humoral immunogenic potency, in mice. We have now examined the pattern of immune response raised by two Tat-stabilized proteins previously mixed with Alum, in mice and macaques. We found that BALB/c and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice raise a Th2 immune response that contrasts with the mixed Th1/Th2 response observed in cynomolgus macaques indicating that the profile of response found in mice cannot be extrapolated to macaques. We thoroughly analyzed the macaque anti-Tat immune response and observed that the anti-Tat antibodies appear after only one immunization and that their titers remain elevated up to 8 weeks after the last injection. We found a similar behavior for the cellular immune response. Furthermore, we observed that approximately 50% of the IFN-gamma-secreting Tat-specific T-cells are CD8 lymphocytes. Last, we observed that the macaque sera neutralize the transactivating activity of Tat. This analysis shows that the two Tat-stabilized preparations raise a potent and long-lasting humoral and cellular immune response in cynomolgus macaque and opens an avenue to investigate whether a strong anti-Tat immune response can protect non-human primates against a viral challenge.",M2
19593983,"Strain differences of cerebral ventricles in mice: can the MRL/MpJ mouse be a model for hydrocephalus?Hydrocephalus is an intractable disease characterized by the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cerebral ventricles. There are many cases in both human and animals; however, the cause and mechanism of it's development is not clearly understood. In this study, differences of cerebral ventricles in 5 inbred mice strains (MRL/MpJ, C57BL/6, C3H/He, <e>DBA</e>/2 and BALB/c) were investigated by histological techniques to determine the possibility of a new animal model for hydrocephalus. Our analysis showed that significant differences in the volume and the surface area of lateral ventricles in the 5 inbred strains, with MRL/MpJ mice having the largest lateral, third, aqueduct and fourth ventricles. In addition, when MRL/MpJ mice were compared to BALB/c mice on 0 day after birth, the former already had larger lateral ventricles than the latter. Although there were no significant difference in the ratios of ependymal cell types in MRL/MpJ mice and BALB/c mice, the number and the diameter of lipid droplets in MRL/MpJ mice were, interestingly, smaller than those in BALB/c mice. It is well known that ependymal cells absorb nutritional substances in CSF by endocytosis, suggesting the possibility that their decrease may relate to the larger cerebral ventricles in MRL/MpJ. In conclusion, MRL/ MpJ mice have greater volumes in cerebral ventricles than other strains and may be useful for a model showing high susceptibility to hydrocephalus.",M2
19589873,"4-Hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl-mediated decrease in serum thyroxine level in mice occurs through increase in accumulation of thyroxine in the liver.4-Hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl (4-OH-CB187) was selected as a major hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolite detected from serum of wildlife and humans and was examined for its effect on level of serum thyroid hormone in mice. Four days after treatment of C57BL/6 and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice with 4-OH-CB187 (1.0 mg/kg), the serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) levels were decreased in both strains of mice. On the other hand, no significant changes in the level and activity of the T(4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, including UGT1a and UGT1a1, by the 4-OH-CB187 treatment were observed in either strain of mice. No 4-OH-CB187-mediated change in level of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was observed in either strain of mice. Binding levels of [(125)I]T(4) to serum proteins after administration of [(125)I]T(4) were significantly changed in 4-OH-CB187-pretreated mice: a decrease in the level of serum [(125)I]T(4)-transthyretin (TTR) complex and an increase in the binding level of [(125)I]T(4) to serum albumin and thyroxine binding protein in both strains of mice. Clearance from serum of T(4) was promoted by 4-OH-CB187 pretreatment in both C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice, and the levels of T(4) in several tissues, especially the liver, were increased. In addition, 4-OH-CB187-mediated decreases in serum total T(4) and free T(4) levels were observed in wild-type and TTR-heterozygous mice but not in TTR-deficient mice. The present findings show that 4-OH-CB187 shows a definite ability to decrease serum T(4) level and further indicate that the 4-OH-CB187-induced decrease would occur through increase in accumulation of T(4) in the liver.",M2
19577600,"L-Asparaginase encapsulated intact erythrocytes for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).As a primary drug for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), encapsulation of L-asparaginase (ASNase) into red blood cells (RBC) has been popular to circumvent immunogenicity from the exogenous protein. Unlike existing methods that perturbs RBC membranes, we introduce a novel method of RBC-incorporation of proteins using the membrane-translocating low molecular weight protamine (LMWP). Confocal study of fluorescence-labeled LMWP-ovalbumin, as a model protein conjugate, has shown significant fluorescence inside RBCs. Surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy of the RBCs loaded with LMWP-ASNase was indistinguishable with normal RBCs. These drug loaded RBCs also closely resembled the profile of the native erythrocytes in terms of osmotic fragility, oxygen dissociation and hematological parameters. The in vivo half-life of enzyme activity after administering 8 units of RBC/LMWP-ASNase in <e>DBA</e>/2 mice was prolonged to 4.5+/-0.5 days whereas that of RBCs loaded with ASNase via a hypotonic method was 2.4+/-0.7 days. Furthermore, the mean survival time of DBA/2 mice bearing mouse lymphoma cell L5178Y was improved by approximately 44% compared to the saline control group after treatment with the RBC loaded enzymes. From these data, an innovative, novel method for encapsulating proteins into intact and fully functional erythrocytes was established for potential treatment of ALL.",M2
19573259,"Effects of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)regulatory T cells on early Plasmodium yoelii 17XL infection in BALB/c mice.The outcome of Plasmodium yoelii 17XL-infected BALB/c and <e>DBA</e>/2 mice, ranging from death to spontaneous cure, respectively, depends largely on the establishment of effective pro-inflammatory type 1 responses during the early stages of infection and associates with CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, effects of Tregs were analysed on early P. yoelii 17XL infection in BALB/c and DBA/2 mice. In vivo depletion of Tregs significantly reversed the inhibited establishment of effective pro-inflammatory type 1 responses in BALB/c mice, indicating that this cell population contributed to the suppression of T-cell function in malaria. Moreover, the proportion and absolute numbers of IL-10-secreting Tregs in BALB/c mice were significantly higher than that found in DBA/2 mice by intracytoplasmic staining, and IL-10 production was correlated with the Tregs population. In addition, in vivo Tregs depletion decreased the production of IL-10 and the apoptosis of CD4+ T cells. Consistently, IL-10R blockade also had the same effect as that of Tregs depletion in P. yoelii 17XL-infected BALB/c mice. Our data demonstrate that Tregs perhaps have an important role in regulating pro-inflammatory type 1 responses in an IL-10-dependent manner and induce CD4+ T cell apoptosis during the early stage of P. yoelii 17XL infection.",M2
19567252,"Use of biofluorescence imaging to compare the distribution of certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab in the inflamed paws of mice with collagen-induced arthritis.Exposure to a drug at the site of inflammation may be an important consideration for the effective treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this in vivo study was to identify a methodology to enable effective quantification of antibody-type reagents in normal and inflamed tissue by investigating the distribution of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab, in healthy and inflamed murine tissue using a novel non-invasive biofluorescence method. Certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab were labeled with the low molecular weight dye alexa680. The agents were administered intravenously at a dose of 2mg/kg in naïve <e>DBA</e>/1 mice and in DBA/1 mice with ongoing collagen-induced arthritis. Concentrations of the TNF inhibitors in the hind paws were measured using a Xenogen IVIS200 biofluorescence imager at multiple time points up to 26h post-administration. In 2 independent experiments, the distribution of certolizumab pegol was compared with that of adalimumab and infliximab. Certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab all distributed more effectively into inflamed tissue than non-inflamed tissue in this animal model of arthritis. However, the ratio of penetration of certolizumab pegol into inflamed arthritic paws compared with normal tissue was greater than that observed with adalimumab and infliximab. Furthermore, the duration of exposure in the inflamed versus normal tissue was more prolonged for certolizumab pegol than for both adalimumab and infliximab, and the accumulation of certolizumab pegol in diseased tissue was more responsive to the severity of inflammation when compared with adalimumab and infliximab. It is probable that these features of certolizumab pegol are conferred on the molecule by PEGylation. It is important to assess exposure to drug at the site of inflammation, because distinct structural features of certain agents may affect efficacy, tolerability, rapidity and/or sustainability of effect. The novel non-invasive biofluorescence method used in this study is an effective tool for comparing tissue penetration of therapeutic agents.",M2
19540906,"Event-related oscillations as risk markers in genetic mouse models of high alcohol preference.Mouse models have been developed to simulate several relevant human traits associated with alcohol use and dependence. However, the neurophysiological substrates regulating these traits remain to be completely elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) responses can be found that distinguish high-alcohol preferring from low alcohol preferring mice that resemble differences seen in human studies of individuals with high and low risk for alcohol dependence. Recently, evidence of genes that affect event-related oscillations (EROs) and the risk for alcohol dependence has emerged, however, to date EROs have not been evaluated in genetic mouse models of high and low alcohol preference. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize EROs in mouse models of high (C57BL/6 [B6] and high alcohol preference 1 [HAP-1] mice) and low (<e>DBA</e>/2J [D2] and low alcohol preference-1 [LAP-1] mice) alcohol preference. A time-frequency representation method was used to determine delta, theta and alpha/beta ERO energy and the degree of phase variation in these mouse models. The present results suggest that the decrease in P3 amplitudes previously shown in B6 mice, compared to D2 mice, is related to reductions in evoked delta ERO energy and delta and theta phase locking. In contrast, the increase in P1 amplitudes reported in HAP-1 mice, compared to LAP-1 mice, is associated with increases in evoked theta ERO energy. These studies suggest that differences in delta and theta ERO measures in mice mirror changes observed between groups at high- and low-risk for alcoholism where changes in EROs were found to be more significant than group differences in P3 amplitudes, further suggesting that ERO measures are more stable endophenotypes in the study of alcohol dependence. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between expression of these neurophysiological endophenotypes and the genetic profile of these mouse models.",M2
19539693,"A proof of concept study: human C48-placenta immunoregulatory factor is an effective, single therapeutic agent enabling allogeneic, nonmanipulated murine bone marrow transplantation.OBJECTIVE: Cloned placenta immunoregulatory ferritin (PLIF) contains a novel, nonferritin bioactive domain (C-48) with immunodulatory activity. We documented that treatment of whole human bone marrow cells with PLIF and its subcloned C48 proteins resulted in myeloid progenitor cell growth and differentiation and T-cell suppression via an effect on the cytokine network. We tested whether this differential effect supports allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with long-lasting tolerance without any further treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Splenocyte-enriched C3H (H2(k)) whole bone marrow was transplanted into C57Bl (H2(b)) recipients after total body irradiation. Recipients were injected with recombinant C48 (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 21 days or with glutathione S-transferase. Animals were monitored for survival, chimerism, and clinical signs of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Next, chimera whole bone marrow was transplanted to secondary myeloablated C57Bl (H2(b)) hosts without treatment. RESULTS: Mice that received C48 treatment following allogeneic splenocyte-enriched bone marrow transplantation demonstrated full-donor chimerism without GVHD mortality, and normal blood cell counts in 75% of recipients. Secondary transplants from the full chimera to myeloblated C57Bl hosts showed 100% engraftment, no GVHD mortality, and no impairment in the long-term hematopoietic reconstitution potential. Allogeneic response of spleen cells from secondary chimeras against donor C3H (H2(k)) and recipient C57Bl (H2(b)) were similar to syngeneic response, whereas reactivity to third party (<e>DBA</e> H2(d)) was significantly enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study provide the proof of concept that C48-a novel, single, bifunctional therapeutic modality enabled successful allogeneic, unmanipulated bone marrow transplantation without GVHD, and with lasting specific tolerance.",M2
19563398,"Effect of GM-CSF on cytokine induction by soluble beta-glucan SCG in vitro in beta-glucan-treated mice.SCG is a 6-branched 1,3-beta-D-glucan, which are major cell wall structural components in fungi. Leukocytes from <e>DBA</e>/1 and DBA/2 mice are highly sensitive to SCG, producing cytokines such as GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-12p70, but not IL-6. GM-CSF plays a key biological role in this activity. In the present study, we examined the effect of giving i.p. SCG to DBA/2 mice on cytokine production in vitro. SCG was given i.p. to DBA/2 mice on day 0. Splenocytes were prepared on day 7 and cultured in the presence of SCG in vitro. The levels of cytokine production induced by SCG in vitro were lower in the cells from SCG-treated mice than in control mice. Expression of the beta-glucan receptor, dectin-1, in SCG-treated mice was comparable with that shown in control mice. However, the consumption of exogenously added rmGM-CSF in vitro was observed in SCG-treated mice. The addition of a large amount of rmGM-CSF to the culture medium resulted in larger amounts of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in SCG-treated mice than in normal mice. These results suggested that GM-CSF was closely related with the reactivity of beta-glucan. Giving SCG increased the number of macrophages and granulocytes in the spleen. These results suggested that in SCG-treated mice, a change of cell population would be related to modulation of the profile of cytokine production induced by SCG in vitro.",M2
