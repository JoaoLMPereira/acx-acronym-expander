20112395,"Tumor necrosis factor neutralization results in disseminated disease in acute and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with normal granuloma structure in a cynomolgus macaque model.OBJECTIVE: An increased risk of tuberculosis has been documented in humans treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-neutralizing agents. In murine models, impaired signaling by TNF causes exacerbation of both acute and chronic infection associated with aberrant granuloma formation and maintenance. This study was undertaken to investigate immune modulation in the setting of TNF neutralization in primary and latent tuberculosis in a non-human primate model. METHODS: Cynomolgus macaques 4 years of age or older were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and subjected to clinical, microbiologic, immunologic, and radiographic examinations. Monkeys were classified as having active or latent disease 6-8 months after infection, based on clinical criteria. Monkeys used in acute infection studies were randomized to receive either adalimumab (prior to and during infection) or no treatment. Monkeys with latent infection that were randomized to receive TNF-neutralizing agent were given either an inhibitor of soluble TNF, recombinant methionyl human soluble TNF receptor I (p55-TNFRI), or adalimumab. Control monkeys with latent infection were given no treatment or saline. Data from previously studied monkeys with active or latent disease were also used for comparison. RESULTS: Administration of TNF-neutralizing agents prior to M tuberculosis infection resulted in fulminant and disseminated disease by 8 weeks after infection. Neutralization of TNF in latently infected cynomolgus macaques caused reactivation in a majority of animals as determined by gross pathologic examination and bacterial burden. A spectrum of dissemination was noted, including extrapulmonary disease. Surprisingly, monkeys that developed primary and reactivation tuberculosis after TNF neutralization had similar granuloma structure and composition to that of control monkeys with active disease. TNF neutralization was associated with increased levels of interleukin-12, decreased levels of <e>CCL4</e>, increased chemokine receptor expression, and reduced mycobacteria-induced interferon-gamma production in blood but not in the affected mediastinal lymph nodes. Finally, the first signs of reactivation often occurred in thoracic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: These findings have important clinical implications for determining the mechanism of TNF neutralization-related tuberculosis.",M1
20046229,"Fat-storing multilocular cells expressing CCR5 increase in the thymus with advancing age: potential role for CCR5 ligands on the differentiation and migration of preadipocytes.Age-associated thymic involution is characterized by decreased thymopoiesis, adipocyte deposition and changes in the expression of various thymic microenvironmental factors. In this work, we characterized the distribution of fat-storing cells within the aging thymus. We found an increase of unilocular adipocytes, ERTR7(+) and CCR5(+ )fat-storing multilocular cells in the thymic septa and parenchymal regions, thus suggesting that mesenchymal cells could be immigrating and differentiating in the aging thymus. We verified that the expression of CCR5 and its ligands, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e> and CCL5, were increased in the thymus with age. Hypothesizing that the increased expression of chemokines and the CCR5 receptor may play a role in adipocyte recruitment and/or differentiation within the aging thymus, we examined the potential role for CCR5 signaling on adipocyte physiology using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line. Increased expression of the adipocyte differentiation markers, PPARgamma2 and aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells was observed under treatment with CCR5 ligands. Moreover, 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated an ability to migrate in vitro in response to CCR5 ligands. We believe that the increased presence of fat-storing cells expressing CCR5 within the aging thymus strongly suggests that these cells may be an active component of the thymic stromal cell compartment in the physiology of thymic aging. Moreover, we found that adipocyte differentiation appear to be influenced by the proinflammatory chemokines, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.",M1
19917679,"CCR5 ligands modulate CXCL12-induced chemotaxis, adhesion, and Akt phosphorylation of human cord blood CD34+ cells.CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play an important role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) migration from and retention within the bone marrow. HSPCs are very selective in their chemotactic response and undergo chemotaxis only in response to CXCL12. In addition to CXCR4, HSPCs express receptors for various other chemokines; however, the role of these receptors is not well understood. Freshly isolated CD34(+) cells (highly enriched for HSPCs) from cord blood (CB) express low levels of CCR5; however, if the cells were washed with acidic buffer before Ab staining to remove any ligand bound to CCR5, then nearly 80% of CD34(+) CB cells were found to express CCR5 on the cell surface. Although none of the CCR5 ligands investigated in this study (CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5) induced chemotaxis, at relatively high concentrations they transiently enhanced CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis of CD34(+) CB cells. In contrast, CXCL12-mediated adhesion of cells to VCAM-1-coated surfaces was reduced if CD34(+) CB cells were pretreated with these CCR5 ligands for 15 min. The effect of these chemokines on CXCL12-mediated responses was not at the level of CXCR4 expression, but on downstream signaling pathways elicited by CXCL12. Pretreatment with CCR5 chemokines enhanced CXCL12-mediated Akt phosphorylation, but down-modulated calcium flux in CD34(+) CB cells. Modulation of CXCL12-mediated responses of CD34(+) cells by CCR5 chemokines provides a possible mechanism that underlies movement of HSPCs during inflammation.",M1
19898927,"Chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.INTRODUCTION: Understanding the genital mucosal immunity and the factors involved in linking innate to adaptive immunity is crucial for the design of efficient preventive strategies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. METHODS: Levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between 58 HIV-1-uninfected and 50 HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as 53 HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. RESULTS: HIV-1-infected CSWs had significantly higher blood and genital levels of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-3/CCL7) and monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG/CXCL9) compared with those in both the HIV-1-uninfected CSW and non-CSW groups. In the HIV-1-infected group, levels of MCP-3 and MIG were significantly higher in the genital mucosa than in the blood. However, the blood levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1a/CCL3) and MIP-1b/<e>CCL4</e> were higher in HIV-1-uninfected CSWs compared with those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Increased production of chemokines in the genital tract may favour the recruitment of HIV-1 target cells causing a mucosal environment that promotes viral replication and dissemination, whereas higher expression of beta-chemokines at the systemic level is associated with protection from HIV-1 infection.",M1
19841162,"FROUNT is a common regulator of CCR2 and CCR5 signaling to control directional migration.FROUNT is a known CCR2-binding protein that facilitates monocyte/macrophage infiltration. Here we report that FROUNT also binds to the C-terminal region of CCR5 and enhances CCR5-mediated cellular chemotaxis. We show that FROUNT overexpression enhances the directionality of chemotaxis, while FROUNT suppression results in impaired responsiveness. Furthermore, we found an increase in consolidated pseudopodium formation in FROUNT-overexpressing cells (FNT cells) on uniform stimulation with <e>CCL4</e> (MIP1-beta), a specific ligand of CCR5. In most FNT cells, one to two pseudopodia directed toward higher chemokine concentration were found, whereas most FNT-suppressed cells had multiple pseudopodia. The data indicate that FROUNT is involved in sensing and amplifying a shallow extracellular chemokine gradient that leads to a limited number of accurate pseudopodia directed toward the chemokine concentration. In addition to its separate roles in CCR2- and CCR5-mediated chemotaxis, FROUNT, as a common regulator of these receptors, possibly plays a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells expressing these receptors.",M1
19735274,"Influence of early gut microbiota on the maturation of childhood mucosal and systemic immune responses.INTRODUCTION: Among sensitized infants, those with high, as compared with low levels, of salivary secretory IgA (SIgA) are less likely to develop allergic symptoms. Also, early colonization with certain gut microbiota, e.g. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium species, might be associated with less allergy development. Although animal and in vitro studies emphasize the role of the commensal gut microbiota in the development of the immune system, the influence of the gut microbiota on immune development in infants is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early colonization with certain gut microbiota species associates with mucosal and systemic immune responses i.e. salivary SIgA and the spontaneous Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine/chemokine responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 64 Swedish infants, followed prospectively up to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR using primers binding to Clostridium difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis. Saliva was collected at age 6 and 12 months and at 2 and 5 years and SIgA was measured with ELISA. The PBMCs, collected 12 months after birth, were analysed for TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression with real-time PCR. Further, the PBMCs were stimulated with LPS, and cytokine/chemokine responses were measured with Luminex. RESULTS: The number of Bifidobacterium species in the early fecal samples correlated significantly with the total levels of salivary SIgA at 6 months. Early colonization with Bifidobacterium species, lactobacilli groups or C. difficile did not influence TLR2 and TLR4 expression in PBMCs. However, PBMCs from infants colonized early with high amounts of Bacteroides fragilis expressed lower levels of TLR4 mRNA spontaneously. Furthermore, LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, e.g. IL-6 and <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1 beta), was inversely correlated to the relative amounts of Bacteroides fragilis in the early fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterial diversity may enhance the maturation of the mucosal SIgA system and early intense colonization with Bacteroides fragilis might down-regulate LPS responsiveness in infancy.",M1
19664723,"Coxsackievirus B3 infection promotes generation of myeloid dendritic cells from bone marrow and accumulation in the myocardium.Myocarditis is associated with increased number of CD4+ T cells in the myocardium after coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. Previous studies show that CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) loaded with myosin could induce myocarditis. This study aims to investigate the generation and accumulation of mDC in CVB3-induced myocarditis. The presence of mDC in myocardium was detected by immunohistochemisty. Bone marrow-derived mDC were generated from uninfected and CVB3-infected mice. The percentage of CD11c+ mDC on cultured cells and mean fluorescence index (MFI) of double positive cells (CD11c+CD40+, CD11c+CD80+) were measured by flow cytometry. The expression of chemokine receptors (CCR5, CCR7) on mDC and chemokines (<e>CCL4</e>, CCL19) in the myocardium was detected. The migration of mDC in response to CCL4 or CCL19 was measured by chemotaxis assay. Mature mDC were elevated in the myocardium from CVB3-infected mice. The percentage of mDC generated from CVB3-infected group was increased. The MFI of CD11c+CD40+ and CD11c+CD80+ was increased in CVB3-infected group. The mDC showed a down-regulation of CCR5 and unaffected CCR7 mRAN levels associated with elevated CCL4 and CCL19 in the myocardium in CVB3-infected group. Numbers of migrating bone marrow-derived mDC from CVB3-infected mice were increased in vitro. We conclude that CVB3 infection induced the greater generation of mDC from bone marrow and accumulation of mature mDC in myocardial tissues. This migration was associated with increased levels of both CCL4 and CCL19 in the heart tissue. These suggest that blocking the migration of mDC may provide a novel therapy for myocarditis.",M1
19620252,"An arrestin-dependent multi-kinase signaling complex mediates MIP-1beta/<e>CCL4</e> signaling and chemotaxis of primary human macrophages.MIP-1beta/CCL4 is a principal regulator of macrophage migration and signals through CCR5. Several protein kinases are linked to CCR5 in macrophages including the src kinase Lyn, PI3K, focal adhesion related kinase Pyk2, and members of the MAPK family, but whether and how these kinases regulate macrophage chemotaxis are not known. To define the role of these signaling molecules, we examined the functions and interactions of endogenous proteins in primary human macrophages. Using siRNA gene silencing and pharmacologic inhibition, we show that chemotaxis in response to CCR5 stimulation by MIP-1beta requires activation of Pyk2, PI3K p85, and Lyn, as well as MAPK ERK. MIP-1beta activation of CCR5 triggered translocation of Pyk2 and PI3K p85 from the cytoplasm to colocalize with Lyn at the plasma membrane with formation of a multimolecular complex. We show further that arrestins were recruited into the complex, and arrestin down-regulation impaired complex formation and macrophage chemotaxis toward MIP-1beta. Together, these results identify a novel mechanism of chemokine receptor regulation of chemotaxis and suggest that arrestins may serve as scaffolding proteins linking CCR5 to multiple downstream signaling molecules in a biologically important primary human cell type.",M1
19491390,"B-cell antigen receptor signaling enhances chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration and survival: specific targeting with a novel spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, R406.Antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) is considered to promote the expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a key component of BCR signaling, can be blocked by R406, a small-molecule Syk inhibitor, that displayed activity in CLL patients in a first clinical trial. In this study, we investigated the effects of BCR stimulation and R406 on CLL cell survival and migration. The prosurvival effects promoted by anti-IgM stimulation and nurselike cells were abrogated by R406. BCR triggering up-regulated adhesion molecules, and increased CLL cell migration toward the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. BCR activation also enhanced CLL cell migration beneath marrow stromal cells. These responses were blocked by R406, which furthermore abrogated BCR-dependent secretion of T-cell chemokines (CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e>) by CLL cells. Finally, R406 inhibited constitutive and BCR-induced activation of Syk, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and AKT, and blocked BCR-induced calcium mobilization. These findings suggest that BCR activation favors CLL cell homing, retention, and survival in tissue microenvironments. R406 effectively blocks these BCR-dependent responses in CLL cells, providing an explanation for the activity of R406 in patients with CLL.",M1
19479036,"CD152 (CTLA-4) determines CD4 T cell migration in vitro and in vivo.BACKGROUND: Migration of antigen-experienced T cells to secondary lymphoid organs and the site of antigenic-challenge is a mandatory prerequisite for the precise functioning of adaptive immune responses. The surface molecule CD152 (CTLA-4) is mostly considered as a negative regulator of T cell activation during immune responses. It is currently unknown whether CD152 can also influence chemokine-driven T cell migration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the consequences of CD152 signaling on Th cell migration using chemotaxis assays in vitro and radioactive cell tracking in vivo. We show here that the genetic and serological inactivation of CD152 in Th1 cells reduced migration towards <e>CCL4</e>, CXCL12 and CCL19, but not CXCL9, in a G-protein dependent manner. In addition, retroviral transduction of CD152 cDNA into CD152 negative cells restored Th1 cell migration. Crosslinking of CD152 together with CD3 and CD28 stimulation on activated Th1 cells increased expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR7, which in turn enhanced cell migration. Using sensitive liposome technology, we show that mature dendritic cells but not activated B cells were potent at inducing surface CD152 expression and the CD152-mediated migration-enhancing signals. Importantly, migration of CD152 positive Th1 lymphocytes in in vivo experiments increased more than 200% as compared to CD152 negative counterparts showing that indeed CD152 orchestrates specific migration of selected Th1 cells to sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show here, that CD152 signaling does not just silence cells, but selects individual ones for migration. This novel activity of CD152 adds to the already significant role of CD152 in controlling peripheral immune responses by allowing T cells to localize correctly during infection. It also suggests that interference with CD152 signaling provides a tool for altering the cellular composition at sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge.",M1
19409880,"Leptin enhances CC-chemokine ligand expression in cultured murine macrophage.Despite accumulating evidence, the role of leptin in chemokine expression is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of leptin on CC-chemokine ligands (CCLs), CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5 gene expression in cultured murine macrophage, J774A.1 cells. Expression of all these CCLs mRNA was gradually increased and significant up-regulation was observed for 3-12 h exposure to leptin (1 microM). The phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) was significantly increased for 5-20 min exposure to leptin, and it was localized in leptin receptor-positive macrophage. Pretreatment with AG490 (100 microM), a janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, significantly suppressed leptin-induced pSTAT3 increases and the up-regulation of CCLs mRNA expression. In conclusion, leptin enhances CCLs expression in cultured murine macrophage, through activation of a JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Therefore, a new paradigm of leptin-mediated chemokine expression may lead to the clarification of complex immune systems in future.",M1
19383907,"CD38/CD31, the CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> chemokines, and CD49d/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 are interchained by sequential events sustaining chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival.CD38 and CD49d are associated negative prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite evidence that both molecules are involved in interactions occurring between CLL and normal cells in the context of CLL-involved tissues, a functional link is still missing. Using gene expression profiles comparing CD38(+)CD49d(+) versus CD38(-)CD49d(-) CLL cells, we showed overexpression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in cells from the former group. These chemokines were also up-regulated by CD38 signals in CLL; moreover, CCL3 was expressed by CLL cells from bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of CD38(+)CD49d(+) but not CD38(-)CD49d(-) cases. High levels of CCR1 and, to a lesser extent, CCR5, the receptors for CCL3 and CCL4, were found in CLL-derived monocyte-macrophages. Consistently, CCL3 increased monocyte migration, and CD68(+) macrophage infiltration was particularly high in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL. Conditioned media from CCL3-stimulated macrophages induced endothelial cells to express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CD49d ligand, likely through tumor necrosis factor alpha overproduction. These effects were apparent in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL, where lymphoid infiltrates were characterized by a prominent meshwork of VCAM-1(+) stromal/endothelial cells. Lastly, CD49d engagement by VCAM-1 transfectants increased viability of CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL cells. Altogether, CD38 and CD49d can be thought of as parts of a consecutive chain of events ultimately leading to improved survival of CLL cells.",M1
19112861,"[The role of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and <e>CCL4</e>/ MIP-1 beta in pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome]PURPOSE: To evaluate the concentration of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and CCL4/ MIP-1 beta in film tears in patients with dry eye syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tears samples were collected from 62 patients with dry eye syndrome and 18 patients from control group. The concentration of chemokines in film tears were determined by immunoenzymatic assay ELISA. RESULTS: We found statistically increased levels of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and CCL4/ MIP-1 beta in film tears of patients with dry eye syndrom compared with control group. CONCLUSION: Inflammation may play role in pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome.",M1
19103522,"Prokineticin 1 induces <e>CCL4</e>, CXCL1 and CXCL8 in human monocytes but not in macrophages and dendritic cells.Prokineticin 1 and 2 (PROK1 and PROK2) are two small proteins largely expressed in inflammatory tissues and involved in monocyte activation and differentiation. The focus of this study was to evaluate whether PROK1 was able to induce chemokine secretion in human monocytes, in monocyte-derived macrophages and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, an aspect not addressed thus far. Here, we show for the first time, using flow cytometry, that PROK receptors 1 and 2 are present on the surface of human monocytes. Subsequently, monocytes were selected to investigate the chemokine response after stimulation by PROK1. Our results show that only three chemokines (CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8) were significantly induced at both the transcript and protein level, and that PROK1 induces most potently CXCL8, in a dose-dependent manner. From a mechanistic point of view, by blocking independently Galphai protein or intracellular calcium, monocytes lose the ability to secrete CXCL8 in response to PROK1. Finally, we observed that CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8 secretion, following PROK1 induction, is only observed in monocytes and not in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. Our results demonstrate that, in vitro, the differentiation status of monocytes influences chemokine production after stimulation by PROK1, and that this chemokine production is geared toward a pro-inflammatory response. This could represent a novel amplification loop of leukocyte recruitment, extravasation and tissue invasion.",M1
19074730,"High-level expression of the T-cell chemokines CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells in nurselike cell cocultures and after BCR stimulation.In lymphatic tissues, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are interspersed with CD68(+) nurselike cells (NLCs), T cells, and other stromal cells that constitute the leukemia microenvironment. However, the mechanism regulating colocalization of CLL and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross talk between CLL and NLCs, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after coculture with NLCs. NLC coculture induced high-level expression of B-cell maturation antigen and 2 chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. CCL3/CCL4 induction in NLC cocultures correlated with ZAP-70 expression by CLL cells. High CCL3/CCL4 protein levels were found in CLL cocultures with NLCs, and CCL3/CCL4 induction was abrogated by R406, a Syk inhibitor, suggesting that NLCs induce these chemokines via B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. BCR triggering also caused robust CCL3/CCL4 protein secretion by CLL cells. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment, namely, the secretion of 2 T-cell chemokines in response to NLC coculture and BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines, CLL cells can recruit accessory cells and thereby actively create a supportive microenvironment.",M1
19047106,"Chemokine markers predict biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following prostatectomy.PURPOSE: Stratifying patients who have a high risk of prostate cancer recurrence following prostatectomy can potentiate the use of adjuvant therapy at an early stage. Inflammation has emerged as a mediator of prostate cancer metastatic progression. We hypothesized that chemokines can be biomarkers for distinguishing patients with high risk for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a nested case-control study, 82 subjects developed biochemical recurrence within 5 years of prostatectomy. Prostate tissues from 98 age-matched subjects who were recurrence-free following prostatectomy in the same period were the controls. A high-throughput lectin-based enrichment of prostate tissue enabled multiplex ELISA to identify the expression of three chemokines to discriminate the two patient populations. RESULTS: The expression of CX3CL1 and IL-15 in prostate tissue was associated with 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival following prostatectomy. However, the expression of chemokine ligand 4 (<e>CCL4</e>) was associated with biochemical recurrence. Multivariable logistic regression model combining preoperative prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, surgical margin, and seminal vesicle status with the three chemokines doubled the specificity of prediction at 90% sensitivity compared with use of the clinicopathologic variables alone (P &lt; 0.0001). Survival analysis yielded a nomogram that supported the use of CX3CL1, IL-15, and CCL4 in predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Each of the three chemokines can serve as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. However, the combination of chemokine biomarkers plus clinicopathologic variables discriminated prostatectomy subjects for the probability of biochemical recurrence significantly better than clinicopathologic variables alone.",M1
18781776,"Conservation of unfavorable sequence motifs that contribute to the chemokine quaternary state.In the chemokine family, we characterize two examples of evolutionarily conserved unfavorable sequence motifs that affect quaternary structure. In contrast to the straightforward action of favorable sequences, these unfavorable motifs produce interactions disfavoring one outcome to indirectly promote another one but should not be confused with the broad sampling produced by negative selection and/or design. To identify such motifs, we developed a statistically validated computational method combining structure and phylogeny. This approach was applied in an analysis of the alternate forms of homodimerization exhibited in the chemokine family. While the chemokine family exhibits the same tertiary fold, members of certain subfamilies, including CXCL8, form a homodimer across the beta1 strand whereas members of other subfamilies, including <e>CCL4</e> and CCL2, form a homodimer on the opposite side of the chemokine fold. These alternate dimerization states suggest that CCL4 and CCL2 contain specific sequences that disfavor CXCL8 dimerization. Using our computational approach, we identified two evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs in the CC subfamilies: a drastic two-residue deletion (DeltaRV) and a simple point mutation (V27R). Cloned into the CXCL8 background, these two motifs were experimentally proven to confer a monomeric state. NMR analyses indicate that these variants are structured in solution and retain the chemokine fold. Structurally, the motifs retain a chemokine tertiary fold while introducing unfavorable quaternary interactions that inhibit CXCL8 dimerization. In demonstrating the success of our computational method, our results argue that these unfavorable motifs have been evolutionarily conserved to specifically disfavor one dimerization state and, as a result, indirectly contribute to favoring another.",M1
18767021,"gammadeltaT cell-mediated regulation of chemokine producing macrophages during Listeria monocytogenes infection-induced inflammation.Infection of gammadeltaT cell-deficient (TcRdelta-/-) mice with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) results in an exacerbated inflammatory response characterized by the accumulation of activated macrophages and necrotic liver lesions. Here we investigated whether changes in chemokine production by Lm-elicited macrophages contribute to this abnormal inflammatory response. In response to Lm infection, activated macrophages accumulate in the primary sites of infection in TcRdelta-/- mice and express high amounts of mRNA encoding the chemokines CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta), CXCL2 (MIP-2) and CXCL10 (IP-10). In the infected tissues of TcRdelta-/- the number of chemokine-synthesizing macrophages was higher than in wild-type (WT) mice, with the amount of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta secreted by individual macrophages in the spleen of TcRdelta-/- mice also being significantly higher than in WT mice. By contrast, protease activity and NO production in individual splenic macrophages of Lm-infected TcRdelta-/- and WT mice were comparable. Pathogen-elicited macrophages in TcRdelta-/- mice also expressed high levels of the CCL3 and CCL4 receptor, CCR5. In macrophage-gammadeltaT cell co-cultures, chemokine-producing macrophages were killed by cytotoxic Vgamma1+ T cells in a Fas-FasL-dependent manner consistent with the high levels of chemokine-producing macrophages seen in infected TcRdelta-/- mice being due to the absence of Vgamma1+ T cells. Together these findings highlight the importance of gammadeltaT cells in regulating macrophage anti-microbial responses.",M1
18447713,"Chemokine detection in the cerebral tissue of patients with posttraumatic brain contusions.OBJECT: The clinical outcome of patients with severe head injuries is still critically dependent on their secondary injuries. Although hypoxia and hypotension appear to mediate a substantial proportion of secondary injuries, many studies associate secondary brain injury with neuroinflammatory responses. Chemokines have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid but not in the brain tissue of patients with head trauma. This study was performed to determine if chemokines were expressed in pericontusional brain tissue in patients with moderate or severe head trauma who underwent surgical evacuation of their brain contusions. METHODS: Twelve patients with posttraumatic cerebral contusion requiring a surgical evacuation were studied. A 20- to 40-mg sample of white matter was removed from the surgical cavity in the pericontusional area. Two patients undergoing elective surgery for clip ligation of an unruptured aneurysm were used as controls. The median interval from trauma to biopsy procedure was 44 hours (range 3-360 hours). Total RNA was isolated from these samples and a ribonuclease protection assay was performed to measure the mRNA levels of several chemokines: CCL2, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, and XCL1. RESULTS: The CCL2, a monocyte chemoattractant produced by activated astrocytes, was the most strongly expressed chemokine, followed by CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL4. The chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 were expressed at very low levels, and XCL1 was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Chemokine activation occurs early after moderate or severe head trauma and is maintained for several days after trauma. This event may contribute to neuroinflammatory exacerbation of posttraumatic brain damage in the pericontusional brain tissue.",M1
18440239,"Gender differences in inflammatory proteins and pathways in seasonal allergic rhinitis.In model organisms, thousands of genes differ in expression between females and males. It is not known if differences on a similar scale are found in humans nor how this relates to disease. However, in allergic disease gender differences in the levels of both inflammatory cells and proteins have been shown. In this study, we found lower nasal fluid allergen-specific IgE in women than men with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). This led to genome-wide analyses of gene expression in allergen-challenged CD4(+) cells from patients with SAR before and after treatment with cortisone. Before treatment, 975 genes differed in expression between women and men: 337 were higher in women. After treatment only 428 genes and one pathway differed in expression. The genes that differed in expression between women and men were over-represented in 10 pathways. Five of the pathways regulated chemotaxis. All five were less active in women. One of the pathways was induced by the eosinophilic chemokine <e>CCL4</e>. Analysis of nasal fluid CCL4 protein confirmed lower levels in women with seasonal allergic rhinitis, before and during the pollen season. By contrast, nasal fluid CCL3 levels did not differ between the genders. In summary, this study shows gender differences in specific inflammatory pathways and proteins in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Further studies are warranted to examine if such differences have diagnostic and therapeutic implications in allergic diseases.",M1
18434252,"Relation of circulating concentrations of chemokine receptor CCR5 ligands to C-peptide, proinsulin and HbA1c and disease progression in type 1 diabetes.Th1 related chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 and Th2 related <e>CCL4</e> as ligands of the receptor CCR5 contribute to disease development in animal models of type 1 diabetes. In humans, no data are available addressing the role of these chemokines regarding disease progression and remission. We investigated longitudinally circulating concentrations of CCR5 ligands of 256 newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes. CCR5 ligands were differentially associated with beta-cell function and clinical remission. CCL5 was decreased in remitters and positively associated with HbA1c suggestive of a Th1 associated progression of the disease. Likewise, CCL3 was negatively related to C-peptide and positively associated with the beta-cell stress marker proinsulin but increased in remitters. CCL4 associated with decreased beta-cell stress shown by negative association with proinsulin. Blockage of chemokines or antagonism of CCR5 by therapeutic agents such as maraviroc may provide a new therapeutic target to ameliorate disease progression in type 1 diabetes.",M1
18368065,"Population structure in copy number variation and SNPs in the CCL4L chemokine gene.The recent description of a large amount of copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome has extended the concept of genome diversity. In this study we integrate the analysis of CNV and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CCL4L chemokine gene. CCL4L is a nonallelic copy of <e>CCL4</e>/MIP-1beta chemokine and displays a CNV that also includes the CCL3L gene, a nonallelic copy of CCL3/MIP-1alpha. This CNV and two functionally relevant CCL4L SNPs (rs4796195 and rs3744595) have been recently associated to HIV pathology in three independent studies. We have quantified the CCL4L copy number and genotyped both SNPs in samples from HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel. A strong correlation between CCL4L CNV and one of the SNPs analyzed is found, whereas no significant linkage disequilibrium is found between the two SNPs despite their close distance (647 bp), suggesting a recent appearance of the second SNP when the diversity in the first one and CNV had already been generated. The present study points out that in genes with CNV, it may be a key issue to combine the assessment of gene copy number with the genotyping of relevant SNPs to understand the phenotypic impact of genome variation in the immune response.",M1
18236400,"Role of the cytokine environment and cytokine receptor expression on the generation of functionally distinct dendritic cells from human monocytes.Myeloid dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages evolve from a common precursor. However, factors controlling monocyte differentiation toward DC or macrophages are poorly defined. We report that the surface density of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) alpha subunit in human peripheral blood monocytes varies among donors. Although no correlation was found between the extent of GM-CSFR and monocyte differentiation into DC driven by GM-CSF and IL-4, GM-CSFR expression strongly influenced the generation of CD1a(+) dendritic-like cells in the absence of IL-4. CD1a(+) cells generated in the presence of GM-CSF express CD40, CD80, MHC class I and II, DC-SIGN, MR, CCR5, and partially retain CD14 expression. Interestingly, they spontaneously induce the expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) allogeneic T lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, and migrate toward <e>CCL4</e> and CCL19. Upon stimulation with TLR ligands, they acquire the phenotypic features of mature DC. In contrast, the allostimulatory capacity is not further increased upon LPS activation. However, by blocking LPS-induced IL-10, a higher T cell proliferative response and IL-12 production were observed. Interestingly, IL-23 secretion was not affected by endogenous IL-10. These results highlight the importance of GM-CSFR expression in monocytes for cytokine-induced DC generation and point to GM-CSF as a direct player in the generation of functionally distinct DC.",M1
18223665,"Effect of CCR5 receptor antagonists on endocytosis of the human CCR5 receptor in CHO-K1 cells.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CCR5 chemokine receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that is expressed by macrophages, memory T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells and is activated by chemotactic proteins (e.g. MIP-1alpha [CCL3], MIP-1beta [<e>CCL4</e>] and RANTES [CCL5]). CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and some chemokines can inhibit HIV-1 infection by stimulating CCR5 receptor endocytosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CCR5 antagonists on CCR5 endocytosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of CCR5 agonists and antagonists on receptor internalization in CHO cells, expressing a C-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged human CCR5 receptor (CCR5-GFP), were quantified using a confocal imaging plate reader. KEY RESULTS: MIP-1alpha [CCL3], MIP-1beta [CCL4] and RANTES [CCL5] were all able to stimulate potently the internalization of CCR5-GFP. This effect was inhibited by the non-peptide antagonist TAK 779. The CCR5 peptide antagonist met-RANTES antagonized MIP-1alpha-mediated increases in intracellular free calcium but was also able to stimulate a substantial internalization of the human CCR5-GFP receptor. However, CHO cells exhibited an aminopeptidase activity that was able to metabolize sufficient met-RANTES into an agonist metabolite capable of stimulating calcium mobilization via CCR5 receptors in naïve cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that there is an endogenous aminopeptidase activity on the surface of CHO cells, that produces a slow internalization of the receptor following a time-dependent conversion of receptor-bound met-RANTES from a CCR5 receptor antagonist into a CCR5 agonist molecule.",M1
18203956,"Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activation is required for CCR5-dependent, NF-kB-driven CCL2 secretion elicited in response to HIV-1 gp120 in human primary macrophages.CCL2 (MCP-1) has been shown to enhance HIV-1 replication. The expression of this chemokine by macrophages is up-modulated as a consequence of viral infection or gp120 exposure. In this study, we show for the first time that the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) is required for the production of CCL2 triggered by gp120 in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using a combination of pharmacologic inhibition, confocal laser-scanner microscopy, and enzymatic activity assay, we demonstrate that R5 gp120 interaction with CCR5 activates PC-PLC, as assessed by a time-dependent modification of its subcellular distribution and a concentration-dependent increase of its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, PC-PLC is required for NF-kB-mediated CCL2 production triggered by R5 gp120. Notably, PC-PLC activation through CCR5 is specifically induced by gp120, since triggering CCR5 through its natural ligand <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta) does not affect PC-PLC cellular distribution and enzymatic activity, as well as CCL2 secretion, thus suggesting that different signaling pathways can be activated through CCR5 interaction with HIV-1 or chemokine ligands. The identification of PC-PLC as a critical mediator of well-defined gp120-mediated effects in MDMs unravels a novel mechanism involved in bystander activation and may contribute to define potential therapeutic targets to block Env-triggered pathologic responses.",M1
18178567,"Highly potent HIV inhibition: engineering a key anti-HIV structure from PSC-RANTES into MIP-1 beta/<e>CCL4</e>.The HIV coreceptor CCR5 is a validated target for both the prevention and therapy of HIV infection. PSC-RANTES, an N-terminally modified analogue of one of the natural chemokine ligands of CCR5 (RANTES/CCL5), is a potent inhibitor of HIV entry into target cells. Here, we set out to engineer the anti-HIV activity of PSC-RANTES into another natural CCR5 ligand (MIP-1beta/CCL4), by grafting into it the key N-terminal pharmacophore region from PSC-RANTES. We were able to identify MIP-1beta/CCL4 analogues that retain the receptor binding profile of MIP-1beta/CCL4, but acquire the very high anti-HIV potency and characteristic inhibitory mechanism of PSC-RANTES. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in addition to N-terminal structures from PSC-RANTES, the side chain of Lys33 is also necessary for full anti-HIV potency.",M1
18076643,"Possible role of the innate immunity in temporal lobe epilepsy.PURPOSE: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a multifactorial disease often involving the hippocampus. So far the etiology of the disease has remained elusive. In some pharmacoresistant TLE patients the hippocampus is surgically resected as treatment. To investigate the involvement of the immune system in human TLE, we performed large-scale gene expression profiling on this human hippocampal tissue. METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed on hippocampal specimen from TLE patients with and without hippocampal sclerosis and from autopsy controls (n = 4 per group). We used a common reference pool design to perform an unbiased three-way comparison between the two patient groups and the autopsy controls. Differentially expressed genes were statistically analyzed for significant overrepresentation of gene ontology (GO) classes. RESULTS: Three-way analysis identified 618 differentially expressed genes. GO analysis identified immunity and defense genes as most affected in TLE. Particularly, the chemokines CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> were highly (&gt;10-fold) upregulated. Other highly affected gene classes include neuropeptides, chaperonins (protein protection), and the ubiquitin/proteasome system (protein degradation). DISCUSSION: The strong upregulation of CCL3 and CCL4 implicates these chemokines in the etiology and pathogenesis of TLE. These chemokines, which are mainly expressed by glia, may directly or indirectly affect neuronal excitability. Genes and gene clusters identified here may provide targets for developing new TLE therapies and candidates for genetic research.",M1
18056395,"Caspase-4 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB-dependent production of IL-8 and CC chemokine ligand 4 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 ).Human caspase-4 does not have a corresponding mouse ortholog. Caspase-4 falls within the class of  inflammatory caspases,  being homologous with human caspases 1 and 5 and mouse caspases 1, 11, and 12. To address the function of caspase-4, we generated caspase-4-deficient human THP1 monocytic cell lines which exhibited substantially reduced LPS-induced secretion of several chemokines and cytokines, including IL-8 (CXCL8), <e>CCL4</e> (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1beta), CCL20 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha), and IL-1beta. The LPS-induced expression of the mRNAs encoding these cytokines was correspondingly reduced in the caspase-4-deficient clones. Because a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor blocked LPS-induced IL-8 and CCL4 mRNA expression as well as IL-8 and CCL4 secretion in THP1 cells, we investigated the role of caspase-4 in NF-kappaB signaling. LPS-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and activation were inhibited in all caspase-4-deficient clones. LPS stimulation led to the interaction of endogenous caspase-4 and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via a TRAF6-binding motif (PPESGE), which we identified in caspase-4. Mutation of this site in caspase-4 resulted in the loss of the TRAF6-caspase-4 interaction. Similar TRAF6-binding motifs are known to be functionally important for TRAF6 interactions with other molecules including caspase-8, and for mediating NF-kappaB activation in various immune and nonimmune cell types. Our data suggest that the TRAF6-caspase-4 interaction, triggered by LPS, leads to NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional up-regulation and secretion of important cytokines and chemokines in innate immune signaling in human monocytic cells.",M1
18048089,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator/its soluble receptor system is independently related to carotid atherosclerosis and associated with CC-chemokines in uraemic patients.INTRODUCTION: The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/its soluble receptor (suPAR) and CC-chemokines are two systems contributing in the atherosclerosis. We try to establish whether these two systems were associated among themselves, and the significance of this potential association in relation to carotid atherosclerosis in uraemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined uPA, suPAR, CC-chemokines: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), macrophage inflammatory proteins (CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (CCL5) and the intima-media thickness (IMT) values in uraemic patients on peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), haemodialysis (HD) and healthy controls. RESULTS: The values of the uPA/suPAR system, CCL2, CCL4 and IMT in the patients significantly exceeded those in controls, whereas CCL5 were lower in the patients than in the controls. CCL3 concentrations were similar in all investigated groups. CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5 were positively associated with uPA/suPAR system. CCL2 and CCL4 were associated with IMT. Multivariate analysis showed that uPA, suPAR and age were the strong independent variables linked to IMT values. CONCLUSIONS: The carotid atherosclerosis is independently related to uPA/its soluble receptor system in dialysis patients. In addition, the strong positive associations existed between uPA/suPAR system and CC-chemokines suggesting that these two systems could cooperate and influence of atherosclerosis in these patients.",M1
18005268,"Myeloma cell expression of 10 candidate genes for osteolytic bone disease. Only overexpression of DKK1 correlates with clinical bone involvement at diagnosis.Osteolytic bone disease (OBD) in multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by interactions between MM cells and the bone marrow microenvironment and is characterized by increased osteoclastic bone resorption and decreased osteoblastic bone formation. Recently, the role of osteoblast inhibition has come into focus, especially the possible role of overexpression of DKK1, an inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway. Further, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR have also been reported as candidate genes for OBD. We studied the gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of TNFSF11 (RANKL), TNFSF11A (RANK), TNFRSF11B (OPG), CCL3 (MIP1A), <e>CCL4</e> (MIP1B), PTHR1 (PTHrp), DKK1, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR in purified, immunophenotypic FACS-sorted plasma cells from 171 newly diagnosed MM patients, 20 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and 12 controls. The gene expressions of the analysed genes were correlated with radiographically assessed OBD. Only overexpression of DKK1 was correlated to the degree of OBD. Myeloma cells did not express TNFSF11A, TNFSF11, or TNFRSF11B, and very rarely expressed CCL3 and PTHR11. CCL4, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR were variably expressed, but the expression of these genes showed no correlation with OBD. In contrast, loss of PSME2 expression in MM plasma cells was significantly correlated with OBD.",M1
17920466,"Gene expression profile of macrophage-like U937 cells in response to polyethylene particles: a novel cell-particle culture system.We investigated the gene expression profiles of U937 cells after contact with polyethylene particles. U937 cells were differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cocultured with either retrieved polyethylene particles or commercially produced polyethylene particles (Ceridust 3615, Clariant Japan, Tokyo, Japan). To achieve consistent contact with the polyethylene particles, we used a rotating device. Phagocytosis of the polyethylene particles or retrieved polyethylene particles by differentiated U937 cells stimulated the release of cytokines including interleukin 1beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of IL8, <e>CCL4</e>, CXCR4, and some other genes was up-regulated after contact with retrieved polyethylene particles. This study first reports the gene expression profiles of U937 cells after contact with polyethylene particles. We believe that this experimental model is applicable to all other particulate materials.",M1
17848804,"Effect of ciclesonide treatment on allergen-induced changes in T cell regulation in asthma.BACKGROUND: The allergen-induced release of CCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) may be crucial in asthmatic airway inflammation by recruitment of Th2 cells. In addition, it might lead to aberrant Th2 cell activity through impairment of beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) control. We questioned how chemokine patterns change upon allergen challenge and whether treatment with the inhaled steroid ciclesonide can reduce chemokine release and subsequently prevent allergen-induced changes in Th2 cell regulation and migration. METHODS: Asthma patients were double-blindly treated with placebo or 80 microg ciclesonide for 7 days. We studied allergen-induced changes in sputum chemokines, migration of peripheral blood T cells and control of beta2-agonist fenoterol over T cell migration and alpha-CD3/alpha-CD28-induced cytokine production. RESULTS: Treatment with 80 microg ciclesonide significantly diminished the late asthmatic response. The late asthmatic response was associated with increased sputum levels of CCL17 and <e>CCL4</e> (but none of the other chemokines measured) and loss of beta2-AR control over T cell migration and Th2-type cytokine production. Although ciclesonide treatment did not prevent chemokine release nor altered beta2-AR function in circulating T cells, it exerted an inhibitory effect on TARC-induced T cell migration and alpha-CD3/alpha-CD28-induced cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that CCL17 is involved in allergen-induced dysregulation of Th2 cell migration and cytokine production. Ciclesonide treatment inhibits T cell migration and cytokine production upon allergen inhalation, which is regulated independently from reducing CCL17 release, but may contribute to beneficial effects of ciclesonide on Th2-mediated airway inflammation.",M1
17765942,"Antigen stimulation induces HIV envelope gp120-specific CD4(+) T cells to secrete CCR5 ligands and suppress HIV infection.CD4(+) T cells are critical for effective immune responses against HIV, but they are also the main cell type targeted by the virus. To investigate the key factors that could protect these cells from infection, we evaluated the capacity of HIV gp120-specific human CD4(+) T cells to produce chemokines that inhibit HIV and determined their contribution in suppressing infection in the cells. Antigen stimulation of the CD4(+) T cells elicited production of high amounts of CCR5 chemokines MIP-1alpha (CCL3), MIP-1beta (<e>CCL4</e>), and RANTES (CCL5). Production of these CCR5 ligands was more readily and reproducibly detected than that of IFN-gamma or IL-2. Importantly, in association with secretion of the CCR5 ligands, antigen stimulation made these CD4(+) T cells more resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Conversely, in the absence of antigen stimulation, the cells were readily infected by the virus, and after infection, their capacity to produce MIP-1beta and IFN-gamma rapidly declined. Thus, vaccines that trigger HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells to elicit robust and rapid production of anti-viral chemokines would be advantageous. Such responses would protect virus-specific CD4(+) T cells from HIV infection and preserve their critical functions in mounting and maintaining long-lasting immunity against the virus.",M1
17716649,"Secretion of antiretroviral chemokines by human cells cultured with acyclic nucleoside phosphonates.Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates are novel class of clinically broadly used antivirotics effective against replication of both DNA viruses and retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We have investigated their in vitro effects on immune defence mechanisms in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with the main emphasis on expression of cytokines which are able to suppress the entry of HIV in cells. Included in the study were prototype acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, i.e. 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA; adefovir), 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP), (R)-and (S)-enantiomers of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine [(R)-PMPA; tenofovir] and [(S)-PMPA], and of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine [(R)-PMPDAP] and [(S)-PMPDAP], and their N(6)-substituted derivatives. Some of the compounds were found to substantially enhance secretion of chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-alpha/CCL3), and  regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed and secreted  (RANTES/CCL5). Secretion of MIP-1beta/<e>CCL4</e> was only marginally increased, whereas production of interleukin-16 (IL-16) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) remained uninfluenced. The most effective proved to be the N(6)-cyclooctyl-PMEDAP, N(6)-isobutyl-PMEDAP, N(6)-pyrrolidino-PMEDAP, N(6)-cyclopropyl-(R)-PMPDAP, and N(6)-cyclopentyl-(R)-PMPDAP derivatives. Remarkably enhanced secretion of chemokines was reached within 2-4 h of the cell culture, and was observed at concentration of 2-5 microM. It may be suggested that acyclic nucleoside phosphonates represent a new generation of antivirotics with combined antimetabolic and therapeutically prospective immunostimulatory properties.",M1
17684570,"A decline in CCL3-5 chemokine gene expression during primary simian-human immunodeficiency virus infection.BACKGROUND: The CC-chemokines CCL3, <e>CCL4</e> and CCL5 have been found to block the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV into host cells and to suppress the viral replication in vitro, but the in vivo role of endogenous CC-chemokines in HIV-1 infection is still incompletely understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In this study, the primate host CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 gene expression was evaluated in response to simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in rhesus macaque model. Five rhesus macaques were inoculated with CCR5-tropic SHIV(SF162P4). The mRNA levels of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were measured by real-time PCR at post inoculation day (PID) 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56 and 180 in peripheral blood. In addition, a selected subset of samples from CXCR4-tropic SHIV(Ku1)-infected macaques was included with objective to compare the differences in CC-chemokine down-regulation caused by the two SHIVs. Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) collected from SHIV(SF162P4)-infected animals were also tested by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to corroborate the gene expression results. Predictably, higher viral loads and CD4+ T cell losses were observed at PID 14 in macaques infected with SHIV(Ku1) than with SHIV(SF162P4). A decline in CC-chemokine gene expression was also found during primary (PID 7-21), but not chronic (PID 180) stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that A) SHIV(SF162P4) down-regulated the CC-chemokine gene expression during acute stage of infection to a greater extent (p&lt;0.05) than SHIV(Ku1), and B) such down-regulation was not paralleled with the CD4+ T cell depletion. Evaluation of CC-chemokine enhancing immunomodulators such as synthetic CpG-oligonucleotides could be explored in future HIV vaccine studies.",M1
17640866,"Molecular cloning and characterization of a highly selective chemokine-binding protein from the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus.Ticks are blood-feeding parasites that secrete a number of immuno-modulatory factors to evade the host immune response. Saliva isolated from different species of ticks has recently been shown to contain chemokine neutralizing activity. To characterize this activity, we constructed a cDNA library from the salivary glands of the common brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Pools of cDNA clones from the library were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the conditioned media from the transfected cells were tested for chemokine binding activity by chemical cross-linking to radiolabeled CCL3 followed by SDS-PAGE. By de-convolution of a single positive pool of 270 clones, we identified a full-length cDNA encoding a protein of 114 amino acids, which after signal peptide cleavage was predicted to yield a mature protein of 94 amino acids that we called Evasin-1. Recombinant Evasin-1 was produced in HEK293 cells and in insect cells. Using surface plasmon resonance we were able to show that Evasin-1 was exquisitely selective for 3 CC chemokines, CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> and the closely related chemokine CCL18, with K(D) values of 0.16, 0.81, and 3.21 nm, respectively. The affinities for CCL3 and CCL4 were confirmed in competition receptor binding assays. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that Evasin-1 was monomeric and formed a 1:1 complex with CCL3. Thus, unlike the other chemokine-binding proteins identified to date from viruses and from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, Evasin-1 is highly specific for a subgroup of CC chemokines, which may reflect a specific role for these chemokines in host defense against parasites.",M1
17483450,"Identification of a human CD8+ regulatory T cell subset that mediates suppression through the chemokine CC chemokine ligand 4.Regulatory T cells (Treg) comprise multiple subsets and are important in controlling immunity and inflammation. However, the induction and mode of action of the various distinct Treg subsets remain ill defined, particularly in humans. Here, we describe a human CD8+ lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3)+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg subset, which suppresses T cells partly through the secretion of CC chemokine ligand 4 (<e>CCL4</e>), which can inhibit T cell activation by interfering with T cell receptor signaling. CD8+ Tregs are expanded by antigen in in vivo-primed donors, and can be detected in pathogen-infected human tissue. This CD8+LAG-3+CD25+FoxP3+CCL4+ Treg subset thus may play a role in immunoregulation in humans, including infectious diseases.",M1
17475893,"The CCL3 family of chemokines and innate immunity cooperate in vivo in the eradication of an established lymphoma xenograft by rituximab.The therapeutic mAb rituximab induced the expression of the CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> chemokines in the human lymphoma line BJAB following binding to the CD20 Ag. Induction of CCL3/4 in vitro was specific, was observed in several cell lines and freshly isolated lymphoma samples and also took place at the protein level in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the role of these beta-chemokines in the mechanism of action of rituximab, we synthesized a N-terminally truncated CCL3 molecule CCL3(11-70), which had antagonist activity on chemotaxis mediated by either CCL3 or BJAB supernatant. We also set up an established s.c. BJAB tumor model in athymic mice. Rituximab, given weekly after tumors had reached 250 mm2, led to complete disappearance of the lymphoma within 2-3 wk. Treatment of mice with cobra venom factor showed that complement was required for rituximab therapeutic activity. Treatment of BJAB tumor bearing mice every 2 days with the CCL3(11-70) antagonist, starting 1 wk before rituximab treatment, had no effect on tumor growth by itself, but completely inhibited the therapeutic activity of the Ab. To determine whether CCL3 acts through recruitment/activation of immune cells, we specifically depleted NK cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages using mAbs, clodronate treatment, or Rag2-/-cgamma-/- mice. The data demonstrated that these different cell populations are involved in BJAB tumor eradication. We propose that rituximab rapidly activates complement and induces beta-chemokines in vivo, which in turn activate the innate immunity network required for efficient eradication of the bulky BJAB tumor.",M1
17330138,"CCL3L1 and CCL4L1: variable gene copy number in adolescents with and without human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.As members of the chemokine family, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) and MIP-1beta are unique in that they both consist of non-allelic isoforms encoded by different genes, namely chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), <e>CCL4</e>, CCL3-like 1 (CCL3L1) and CCL4L1. The products of these genes and of CCL5 (encoding RANTES, i.e., regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) can block or interfere with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection through competitive binding to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5). Our analyses of 411 adolescents confirmed that CCL3 and CCL4 genes occurred invariably as single copies (two per diploid genome), whereas the copy numbers of CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 varied extensively (0-11 and 1-6 copies, respectively). Neither CCL3L1 nor CCL4L1 gene copy number variation showed appreciable impact on susceptibility to or control of HIV-1 infection. Within individuals, linear correlation between CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 copy numbers was moderate regardless of ethnicity (Pearson correlation coefficients=0.63-0.65, P&lt;0.0001), suggesting that the two loci are not always within the same segmental duplication unit. Persistently low serum MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta (in the pg/ml range) compared with high CCL5 concentration (ng/ml range) implied that multi-copy genes CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 conferred little advantage in the intensity of expression among uninfected or infected adolescents.",M1
17327452,"<e>CCL4</e> protects from type 1 diabetes by altering islet beta-cell-targeted inflammatory responses.We previously reported that interleukin (IL)-4 treatment of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice elevates intrapancreatic CCL4 expression and protects from type 1 diabetes. Here, we show that antibody neutralization of CCL4 abrogates the ability of T-cells from IL-4-treated NOD mice to transfer protection against type 1 diabetes. Intradermal delivery of CCL4 via a plasmid vector stabilized by incorporation of the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA1/oriP episomal maintenance replicon (pHERO8100-CCL4) to NOD mice beginning at later stages of disease progression protects against type 1 diabetes. This protection was associated with a Th2-like response in the spleen and pancreas; decreased recruitment of activated CD8(+) T-cells to islets, accompanied by diminished CCR5 expression on CD8(+) T-cells; and regulatory T-cell activity in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes. Thus, inflammatory responses that target islet beta-cells are suppressed by CCL4, which implicates the use of CCL4 therapeutically to prevent type 1 diabetes.",M1
17195767,"Chemokine responses are increased in HIV-infected Malawian children with invasive pneumococcal disease.BACKGROUND: Chemokines play an important role in the recruitment and regulation of leukocyte traffic during bacterial infection. The aims of this study were to investigate the chemokine response to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and to examine the influence of HIV infection on the chemokine response, pneumococcal bacterial loads, and outcome. METHODS: We prospectively studied 95 children with IPD, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken at admission for the determination of chemokines, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and pneumococcal bacterial loads. RESULTS: Plasma CXCL8 and CCL2, CSF CXCL8 and <e>CCL4</e>, and IFNgamma were significantly higher in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children. Blood and CSF pneumococcal bacterial loads correlated with plasma and CSF chemokines, respectively, and were higher in HIV-infected children compared with HIV-uninfected children. Among HIV-infected children, plasma concentrations of CXCL8 and CCL2 were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors, but CCL5 was significantly lower. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with IPD had higher concentrations of chemokines (except CCL5) than acutely ill HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with no detectable bacterial infection. Male gender and low plasma CCL2 concentrations were shown to be independently associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Chemokines, in particular CCL2, are associated with survival in IPD and correlate with pneumococcal bacterial loads, disease presentation, and outcome.",M1
17178797,"Expression of immunomodulatory genes in human monocytes induced by voriconazole in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.We assessed the effect of voriconazole (VRC) on the expression and release of selected cytokines and chemokines in the THP-1 human monocytic cell line in response to Aspergillus fumigatus hyphal fragments (HF) by cDNA microarray analysis, reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stimulation of THP-1 cells by HF alone caused a significant up-regulation of <e>CCL4</e> (MIP1B) and CCL16, while CCL2 (MCP1) was down-regulated. By comparison, in the presence of VRC, a large number of genes such as CCL3 (MIP1A), CCL4 (MIP1B), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP3), CCL11 (EOTAXIN), CCL15 (MIP1Delta), CXCL6, and CXCL13 were strongly up-regulated in THP-1 cells challenged by HF, whereas CCL20 (MIP3A) and CCL21 (MIP2) were down-regulated. Among five genes differentially expressed in THP-1 cells, IL12A, IL12B, and IL-16 were down-regulated whereas IL-11 and TGFB1 were significantly up-regulated in the presence of VRC. The inflammation-related genes IFNgamma, IL1R1, and TNFA were also up-regulated in THP-1 cells exposed to HF only in the presence of VRC. RT-PCR of four selected genes validated the results of microarrays. The release of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-12 was significantly increased from monocytes stimulated either by HF alone (P &lt; 0.05) or in the presence of VRC (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha release from monocytes was enhanced only in the presence of VRC (P &lt; 0.01). The chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta were decreased under both conditions (P &lt; 0.01). These results demonstrate that in the presence of VRC, HF induces a more pronounced profile of gene expression in THP-1 cells than HF alone, potentially leading to more-efficient host resistance to A. fumigatus.",M1
17178789,"Induction of host chemotactic response by Encephalitozoon spp.Microsporidians are a group of emerging pathogens typically associated with chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. The number of reports of infections with these organisms and the disseminated pathology is growing as diagnostic tools become more readily available. However, little is known about the innate immune response induced by and generated against these parasites. Using a coculture chemotaxis system, primary human macrophages were infected with Encephalitozoon cuniculi or Encephalitozoon intestinalis, and the recruitment of naïve monocytes was monitored. Encephalitozoon spp. induced an average threefold increase in migration of naïve cells 48 h postinfection, which corresponded to optimal infection of monocyte-derived-macrophages. A limited microarray analysis of infected macrophages revealed several chemokines involved in the inflammatory responses whose expression was upregulated, including CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, CCL7, CCL15, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL8. The levels of 6 of 11 chemokines also present in the microarray were confirmed to be elevated by protein profiling. Kinetic studies confirmed that secreted CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 were expressed as early as 6 h postinfection, with peak expression at 12 to 24 h and expression remaining until 48 h postinfection. Neutralization of these chemokines, specifically CCL4, significantly reduced the number of migrating cells in vitro, indicating their role in the induction of monocyte migration. This mechanism of recruitment not only supports the evidence that in vivo cellular infiltration occurs but also provides new hosts for the parasites, which escape macrophages by rupturing the host cell. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation that chemokine production is induced by microsporidian infections in human macrophages.",M1
17143825,"Influence of human T cell lymphotropic virus type 2 coinfection on virological and immunological parameters in HIV type 1-infected patients.BACKGROUND: Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) infection is not rare among injection drug users with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may exert a protective role in the progression of HIV disease. METHODS: Immunological and virological parameters were compared in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients and a control group of HIV-monoinfected subjects. All individuals were antiretroviral therapy naive. HIV-specific CD8+ T cell levels were measured using an interferon-gamma assay in response to 125 optimally defined HIV peptides divided into 5 pools. Immune activation was evaluated by measuring levels of CD38 in different CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. In a subgroup of patients, the production of <e>CCL4</e> in parallel with interferon-gamma was assessed in response to Gag peptides. RESULTS: Lower plasma HIV-RNA levels were found in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients than in HIV-monoinfected patients, despite the 2 groups having similar CD4+ T cell counts. Coinfected patients also had significantly lower levels of CD38 expression in total CD8+ T cells and in its naive subset. CD8+ T cell levels specific for each pool of peptides were similar in both groups, but cells mainly contributing to HIV Gag-specific responses in coinfected patients were CCL4 positive and interferon-gamma negative, whereas for HIV-monoinfected subjects, the response was dominated by CCL4-positive and interferon-gamma-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-2 coinfection may exert a protective role on HIV disease progression by lowering HIV replication and immune activation. A predominance of CCL4 single positive HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients could explain this effect.",M1

16988274,"Cytokine and chemokine transcription profile during Mycoplasma pulmonis infection in susceptible and resistant strains of mice: macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (<e>CCL4</e>) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (CCL8) and accumulation of CCR5+ Th cells.The progression of murine mycoplasma pneumonia is dependent on T cells and other immune cells. The role of cytokines in immunity are complex, and identifying the network of cytokines produced after infection of mice is essential in dissecting the key cytokine cascades involved mycoplasma disease pathogenesis. In the present study, mRNA expression of 143 different cytokines, chemokines, or receptors were evaluated in lung tissues from both susceptible (BALB/c and C3H/HeN) and resistant (C57BL/6) mice after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection. To accomplish this, membrane-based cDNA microarrays were used to monitor changes mRNA expression in lungs. There was a clear association with disease susceptibility and development of cytokine mRNA expression. In addition to proinflammatory cytokines, mRNA expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10, increased with disease severity, suggesting an attempt to moderate the severity of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, it is clear that an array of chemokines produced in susceptible mice could contribute to the recruitment and maintenance of inflammatory cells at the site of disease. In support of this, there was an increase in macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (MIP-1beta; CCL4) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2; CCL8) mRNA levels from mycoplasma-infected mice and a corresponding accumulation of CD4+ Th cells expressing the MIP-1beta/MCP-2 receptor, CCR5, in the lungs of mice. Furthermore, MIP-1beta- and MCP-2-producing cells and CD4+ T cells were found to be in close association in pulmonary lesions. Thus, there was a significant cytokine response associated with disease pathogenesis, and these studies provide important leads and insights into ongoing cytokine- and chemokine-mediated processes in this persistent inflammatory disease.",M1
16982098,"Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) represses the expression of <e>CCL4</e> in murine macrophages.Acute expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (also known as CCL4) promotes beneficial leukocyte recruitment to infected tissues, but chronic expression of this chemokine contributes to inflammatory disease. CCL4 expression is controlled largely at the transcriptional level and an ATF/CRE sequence located in the promoter (-104 to -97bp, relative to the transcriptional start site) has been identified as a critical cis-acting element. The trans-acting binding proteins that influence CCL4 transcription via this site are largely unknown. We investigated whether activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, binds to the CCL4 ATF/CRE site in macrophages. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that ATF3 binds to the ATF/CRE site within the CCL4 promoter in untreated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that CCL4 mRNA levels in elicited peritoneal macrophages from ATF3(-/-) mice are significantly higher than in congenic ATF3(+/+) macrophages under both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated conditions, suggesting that ATF3 represses transcription of the CCL4 gene. Consistent with the higher gene expression, ATF3-deficient macrophages secreted more CCL4 protein than ATF3(+/+) macrophages. Similar results were obtained in bone-marrow-derived macrophages treated with Toll-like receptor 2, 3, 4 and 5 agonists. Thus, we conclude that ATF3 constitutively binds to the ATF/CRE site in the CCL4 promoter where it represses basal and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-stimulated transcription. Consequently, ATF3 appears to be part of a control mechanism that limits the amount of CCL4 released by macrophages, preventing excessive inflammation.",M1
16979363,"A DNA vaccine encoding <e>CCL4</e>/MIP-1beta enhances myocarditis in experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rats.Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease in Latin America. Exacerbated inflammation disproportional to parasite load characterizes chronic myocardial lesions in chagasic patients. Chemokines and their receptors are expected to account for the renewed inflammatory processes after the inoculation of the parasite, but their potential unique functions are far from being clear. Herein, we evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine encoding CCL4/MIP-1beta, a CC-chemokine, in T. cruzi-elicited myocarditis in rats. Holtzman rats were given intramuscularly cardiotoxin and the CCL4/MIP-1beta DNA-containing plasmid (100microg) was delivered in this muscular site four times. Fourteen days after last immunization, animals were inoculated with a myotropical CL-Brener T. cruzi clone. Peak of parasitism was observed at day 15 after infection, preceding the peak of myocardial inflammation at day 20. Myocarditis was still intense at day 30, but the inflammatory infiltrates showed a more focal distribution. The expression of CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1beta correlated closely with the kinetics of myocardial inflammation. The CCL4/MIP-1beta DNA vaccine induced an increase of the levels of the anti-CCL4/MIP-1beta observed in T. cruzi-infected animals. This was associated with an exacerbation of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, although alterations in parasitemia and myocardial parasitism were not observed. Our data suggest that CCL4/MIP-1beta plays a role in preventing excessive inflammation and pathology rather than in controlling parasite replication.",M1
16815159,"A network-based analysis of the late-phase reaction of the skin.BACKGROUND: The late-phase reaction (LPR) of the skin is an in vivo model of allergic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify disease-associated pathways in the LPR using a network-based analysis. METHODS: The LPR was examined by means of DNA microarray analysis of skin biopsy specimens from 10 patients with allergic rhinitis and 10 healthy control subjects. The results were further analyzed in 2 different materials consisting of nasal fluids and allergen-challenged CD4(+) T cells from patients with allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: The DNA microarray analysis revealed several genes of known relevance to allergy. The eosinophil marker Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (CLC) that encodes Charcot-Leyden crystal protein differed most in expression. A network-based analysis showed upregulation of IL-4- and <e>CCL4</e>-dependent pathways and downregulation of a TGF-beta-induced pathway. CCL4 is expressed by CD4(+) T cells and chemotactic for eosinophils. We hypothesized that allergen induces release of CCL4 from T(H)2 cells and that this contributes to influx of eosinophils. Further analysis showed increase of CCL4 protein in nasal fluids from allergic patients during the season. Allergen challenge of PBMCs resulted in proliferation of T(H)2 cells and increased production of CCL4 in CD4(+) T cells from allergic patients. An analysis of the DNA microarray data revealed a significant correlation between CCL4 and the eosinophil marker CLC. CONCLUSION: A network-based analysis of the LPR showed increased activity of IL-4- and CCL4- dependent pathways and downregulation of the TGF-beta-induced pathway. Allergen-induced release of CCL4 from T(H)2 cells might contribute to influx of eosinophils during the LPR. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Involvement of multiple interacting pathways indicates that it might be difficult to identify one single mediator as a biomarker or drug target in allergic inflammation.",M1
16773571,"Genetic variation in the CCL18-CCL3-<e>CCL4</e> chemokine gene cluster influences HIV Type 1 transmission and AIDS disease progression.CCL3 (MIP-1 alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), and CCL18 (DC-CK1/PARC/AMAC-1) are potent chemoattractants produced by macrophages, natural killer cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. CCL3 and CCL4 are natural ligands for the primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 and are also known to activate and enhance the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Genomic DNAs from &gt;3,000 participants enrolled in five United States-based natural-history cohorts with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were genotyped for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 47-kb interval on chromosome 17q12 containing the genes CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18. All 21 SNPs were polymorphic in African Americans (AAs), whereas 7 of the 21 had minor-allele frequencies &lt;0.01 in European Americans (EAs). Substantial linkage disequilibrium was observed in a 37-kb interval containing 17 SNPs where many pairwise D' values exceeded 0.70 in both racial groups, but particularly in EAs. Four and three haplotype blocks were observed in AAs and EAs, respectively. Blocks were strongly correlated with each other, and common haplotype diversity within blocks was limited. Two significant associations are reported that replicate an earlier study. First, among AA members of the AIDS Link to the Intravenous Experience cohort of injection drug users, frequencies of three correlated SNPs covering 2,231 bp in CCL3 were significantly elevated among highly exposed, persistently HIV-1-uninfected individuals compared with HIV-1-infected seroconvertors (P = .02-.03). Second, seven highly correlated SNPs spanning 36 kb and containing all three genes were significantly associated with more-rapid disease progression among EAs enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study cohort (P = .01-.02). These results reiterate the importance of chemokine gene variation in HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis and emphasize that localized linkage disequilibrium makes the identification of causal mutations difficult.",M1
16760409,"Reduced ability of newborns to produce CCL3 is associated with increased susceptibility to perinatal human immunodeficiency virus 1 transmission.The role of CC chemokines in protection against mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission is not well understood. It was observed that mitogen-induced production of CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> by cord-blood mononuclear cells was increased among infants born to HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative mothers, and that a deficiency in production of CCL3 was associated with increased susceptibility to intrapartum HIV-1 infection. CCL3-L1 gene copy number was associated with CCL3 production and with vertical transmission. However, at equivalent CCL3-L1 gene copy numbers, infants who acquired HIV-1 infection relative to their exposed but uninfected counterparts had lower production of CCL3, suggesting that they may harbour some non-functional copies of this gene. Nucleotide changes that may influence CCL3 production were evident in the CCL3 and CCL3-L1 genes upstream of exon 2. Our findings suggest that infants who display a deficient-production phenotype of CCL3 are at increased risk of acquiring HIV-1, indicating that this chemokine in particular plays an essential role in protective immunity.",M1
16699301,"One-tube-PCR technique for CCL2, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e> and CCL5 applied to fine needle aspiration biopsies shows different profiles in autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroid disorders.Autoimmune thyroid diseases are characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. Chemokines are crucial in the recruitment of lymphocytes and might play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of analysing by one-tube reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique CC chemokine profiles in samples obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). In 27 out of 35 (77%) samples, the material was sufficient for analysis and in 16 (59%) chemokines were detected, thus demonstrating the potential of this technique. Moreover, even in this small group, a statistically significant increase of CCL3 and CCL4 was found in samples from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease as compared to those with multinodular goiter. Chemokine profile measured by improved multiamplification techniques in FNAB thyroid samples may become a useful complementary tool for the management of thyroid autoimmune disease as it constitutes a source of data for research of their pathogenesis.",M1
16637021,"Altered thymocyte migration during experimental acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection: combined role of fibronectin and the chemokines CXCL12 and <e>CCL4</e>.We previously showed migration disturbances in the thymus during experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. These changes were related to the enhanced expression of extracellular matrix ligands and receptors, leading to the escape of immature cells to the periphery. Here, we analyzed the expression and role of selected chemokines (CXCL12 and CCL4) and their receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) in regulating thymocyte migration in conjunction with extracellular matrix during acute T. cruzi infection. We found increased chemokine deposition in the thymus of infected mice when compared to controls, accompanied by enhanced co-localization with fibronectin as well as up-regulated surface expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in thymocytes. We also noticed altered thymocyte migration towards the chemokines analyzed. Such an enhancement was even more prominent when fibronectin was added as a haptotatic stimulus in combination with a given chemokine. Our findings suggest that thymocyte migration results from a combined action of chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM), which can be altered during pathological conditions such as T. cruzi infection, and may be at the origin of the changes in the T cell repertoire seen in this pathological process.",M1
16612374,"Chemokines enhance immunity by guiding naive CD8+ T cells to sites of CD4+ T cell-dendritic cell interaction.CD8+ T cells have a crucial role in resistance to pathogens and can kill malignant cells; however, some critical functions of these lymphocytes depend on helper activity provided by a distinct population of CD4+ T cells. Cooperation between these lymphocyte subsets involves recognition of antigens co-presented by the same dendritic cell, but the frequencies of such antigen-bearing cells early in an infection and of the relevant naive T cells are both low. This suggests that an active mechanism facilitates the necessary cell-cell associations. Here we demonstrate that after immunization but before antigen recognition, naive CD8+ T cells in immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR5, permitting these cells to be attracted to sites of antigen-specific dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell interaction where the cognate chemokines CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> (also known as MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta) are produced. Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4+ T cells to promote memory CD8+ T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8+ T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire.",M1
16452465,"The chemokines, CX3CL1, CCL14, and <e>CCL4</e>, promote human trophoblast migration at the feto-maternal interface.Human embryo implantation is a complex process involving blastocyst attachment to the endometrial epithelium and subsequent trophoblast invasion of the decidua. Chemokines, critical regulators of leukocyte migration, are abundant in endometrial epithelial and decidual cells at this time. We hypothesized that endometrial chemokines stimulate trophoblast invasion. Chemokine receptors CX3CR1 and CCR1 were immunolocalized in human first-trimester implantation sites, specifically to endovascular extravillous trophoblasts, but not to the invading interstitial EVTs (iEVTs), with weak staining also on syncytium. CCR3 was localized to invading iEVTs and to microvilli on the syncytial surface. Expression of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CCL7 (MCP-3), and their receptors (CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5) mRNA was examined in cellular components of the maternal-embryonic interface by RT-PCR. Both chemokines were abundant in entire endometrium and placenta, endometrial cells (primary cultures and HES, a human endometrial epithelial cell line) and trophoblast cell lines (JEG-3, ACIM-88, and ACIM-32). Chemokine receptor mRNA was expressed by placenta and trophoblast cell lines: CCR1 by all trophoblast cell types, whereas CCR2, CCR3, and CX3CR1 were more variable. CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 were also expressed by endometrial cells. Migration assays used the trophoblast cell line most closely resembling extravillous cytotrophoblast (AC1M-88). Trophoblast migration occurred in response to CX3CL1, CCL14, and CCL4, but not CCL7. Endometrial cell-conditioned media also stimulated trophoblast migration; this was attenuated by neutralizing antibodies to CX3CL1 and CCL4. Thus, chemokines are expressed by maternal and embryonic cells during implantation, whereas corresponding receptors are on trophoblast cells. Promotion of trophoblast migration by chemokines and endometrial cell conditioned medium indicates an important involvement of chemokines in maternal-fetal communication.",M1
16433713,"Altered chemokine levels in individuals at risk of Type 1 diabetes mellitus.AIMS: The hypothesis was tested in an exploratory study that individuals at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes mellitus have altered systemic levels of cytokines and chemokines. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two non-diabetic first-degree relatives of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited. Of these, 18 had multiple islet autoantibodies (islet cell antibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, IA-2 antibody). Follow-up for 9-11 years confirmed high vs. moderate diabetes risk in islet autoantibody-positive vs. -negative relatives. Cytokines and chemokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum concentrations of classic Th1-associated cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-18) or Th2/Treg-associated cytokines (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) did not significantly differ in high vs. moderate diabetes risk group. However, of six chemokines analysed, levels of CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> were increased (P = 0.0442 and P = 0.0334) while CCL2 was decreased (P = 0.0318) in the multiple islet autoantibody-positive group. No significant differences were seen for CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10. There was a significant correlation between the two closely related chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 in individuals at risk (r = 0.84, P = 0.00005), but not in the autoantibody-negative group. CONCLUSION: Relatives at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes mellitus have abnormal cellular immune regulation at the level of systemic chemokines. The up-regulation of CCL3 and CCL4 vs. down-regulation of CCL2 suggests opposed functions of these chemokines in the disease process. These findings need to be confirmed by independent studies.",M1
16287062,"Mantle cell lymphomas acquire increased expression of <e>CCL4</e>, CCL5 and 4-1BB-L implicated in cell survival.We have analyzed mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), using high-density DNA microarrays, and confirmed the expression of differentially regulated antigens, using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The results show that MCLs acquire expression of molecules that normally are involved in interaction with other immune cells and, thus, might affect the ability of the tumor to survive. The MCL signature is represented by the overexpression of the chemokine CCL4 (MIP-1beta), implicated in the recruitment of regulatory T cells, as well as CCL5 and 4-1BB-L. The latter molecules are normally involved in chemotaxis of T cells and B cell activation, respectively. Signaling through 4-1BB-L allows B cells to proliferate and the expression of its ligand, by the intra-tumoral mesh of follicular dendritic cells (FDC), could thus serve as a paracrine loop facilitating growth and survival of MCL cells.",M1
16205356,"Alcohol suppresses IL-2-induced CC chemokine production by natural killer cells.BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells are a critical component of the host innate immune system. We investigated whether alcohol impairs NK cell function, particularly production of CC chemokines induced by interleukin (IL)-2, the natural ligands for CCR5 receptor. METHODS: Primary NK cells and NK cell line (YTS) were cultured with or without alcohol (10 to 80 mM) for three hours. The culture supernatants were then harvested and used to treat human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and a HeLa cell line, which expresses CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 receptors (MAGI cells). CC chemokine expression by YTS and primary NK cells treated with or without alcohol was analyzed with the real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. [Ca(2)(+)]i and Western blot assays were used to determine calcium-mediated intracellular signaling pathway and NF-kappaB p65 expression. HIV strains (Bal and UG024) were used to infect macrophages and MAGI cells. In addition, ADA (macrophage-tropic strain) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was carried out in macrophages. HIV infectivity was determined by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and beta-galactosidase activity assays. RESULTS: Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced CC chemokine (CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e>) expression by NK cells. Functional tests demonstrated that this reduced expression of CC chemokines was associated with diminished anti-HIV ability of NK cells. Alcohol also reduced the ability of NK cells to response to CCL3-mediated chemotaxis. Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and calcium mobilization by NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol, through the inhibition of IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and intracellular calcium mobilization, suppressed NK cell production of CC chemokines. This suppression of CC chemokine production was associated with diminished anti-HIV activity of NK cells. Thus, by inhibiting NK cell-mediated innate immunity against HIV, alcohol consumption may have a cofactor role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease.",M1
16178877,"Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced genes in human mast cells using suppression subtractive hybridization: up-regulation of IL-8 and <e>CCL4</e> production.Mast cells have recently been found to be a major player in the host defence against bacterial infection through secretion of potent mediators. Identification of bacteria-induced mast cell mediators and intracellular signalling molecules involved during bacterial infection remains a major area of investigation. Recently we found an active interaction between mast cells and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. To further characterize specific genes in mast cells modulated by P. aeruginosa, we used a new approach for the study of mast cell-bacteria interaction; the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). SSH approach does not require a prerequisite knowledge of target genes and does not rely on the availability of the assay reagents for the specific genes. Using SSH, 94 clones were randomly selected from the subtracted cDNA library for differential screening leading to the identification of 14 P. aeruginosa-up-regulated transcripts. Sequence analysis revealed that expression of IL-1, IL-8 and CCL4 was increased by human mast cells after P. aeruginosa infection. Increased production of IL-1, IL-8 and CCL4 was confirmed at the protein levels. In addition, sequence analysis of the clones also suggests that ribosomal protein S3 and cytochrome b as well as additional 4 uncharacterized genes may potentially be involved in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. Thus, SSH is an effective approach by identifying potential molecular targets for the study of mechanisms involved in P. aeruginosa and mast cell interaction.",M1
16175603,"CCR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis in mice.Experimental T-cell-mediated hepatitis induced by concanavalin A (Con A) involves the production of different cytokines and chemokines and is characterized by leukocyte infiltration. Because the chemokine receptor CCR5 and its ligands (CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5) regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, we investigated the role of CCR5 during Con A-induced liver injury. Serum levels of CCR5 ligands and their hepatic transcript levels were significantly increased after Con A injection, whereas CCR5+ liver mononuclear cells were recruited to the liver. CCR5-deficient (CCR5-/-) mice disclosed increased mortality and liver injury following Con A administration compared with wild-type mice. CCR5-/- mice also exhibited increased production of interleukin 4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, and a prominent liver mononuclear cell infiltrate, among which many cells were CCR1+. In vivo neutralization of CCR5 ligands in CCR5-/- mice afforded a protection against hepatitis only when CCL5 was neutralized. In conclusion, CCR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis, and leads to increased levels of CCR5 ligands and a more pronounced liver mononuclear infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of immuno-mediated liver injury.",M1
16160188,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 and other activation stimuli are highly effective in triggering alpha interferon and CC chemokine production in circulating plasmacytoid but not myeloid dendritic cells.Exposure to aldrithiol-2-inactivated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or gp120, but not gp41, triggered alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, and <e>CCL4</e> production in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) but not in myeloid DCs (M-DCs) or monocyte-derived DCs from the same donors. The nonresponsiveness of M-DCs for IFN-alpha/beta production was a general feature specific to these cells, as they also failed to produce it in response to inactivated influenza virus, poly(I-C), lipopolysaccharide, Staphylococcus aureus Cowans I, or CD40L. The different capacities of circulating DC subsets to produce immune mediators in response to most stimuli argue for a different role for these cells in the regulation of innate immunity to pathogens.",M1
16101183,"Chemokines in human colorectal carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Chemokines (CKs) may promote antitumor immunity in cancer, act as tumor growth factors, influence metastatic spreading or angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CK expression is altered in colorectal carcinomas compared to normal mucosa and to elucidate its possible clinico-pathological implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The levels of CCL2 (MCP-1), <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL 1 (GRO-alpha), CXCL 5 (ENA-78) and CXCL 8 (IL-8) were investigated in 10 colorectal carcinomas and their corresponding normal mucosa by the use of ELISA. RESULTS: All CK analyzed, with the exception of CCL5 (RANTES), were expressed at a significantly higher level in malignant tissue. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic studies in colon carcinomas should, therefore, focus more on the neutralization of CKs than on their application.",M1
16076464,"Transgenic mouse expressing human CCR5 as a model for in vivo assessments of human selective CCR5 antagonists.The species selectivity of receptor antagonists often hinders their preclinical assessment in vivo. In order to evaluate human selective CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists in vivo, we generated human CCR5 transgenic mice that expressed the transgene on both peripheral blood leukocytes as well as thymocytes. The selective CCR5 ligand CC chemokine ligand 4 (<e>CCL4</e>)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta induced the chemotaxis of thymocytes that had been derived from the transgenic mice, but not from littermate mice, suggesting that the human CCR5 expressed in the transgenic mice were functional. The binding of the human CCR5 specific antibody 45531 to peripheral blood granulocytes from the transgenic mice was inhibited by human selective CCR5 antagonist SCH-351125. Using this antibody, we developed an ex vivo assay system that is suitable for the evaluation of a test compound's ability to occupy the human CCR5 receptor on mouse peripheral blood leukocytes. This transgenic mouse model is useful for estimating the pharmacodynamics of human selective CCR5 antagonists in vivo.",M1
16015368,"Variants of CCR5, which are permissive for HIV-1 infection, show distinct functional responses to CCL3, <e>CCL4</e> and CCL5.CCR5 is one of the primary coreceptors for Env-mediated fusion between cells and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Analyses of CCR5 variants in cohorts of HIV-1 high-risk individuals led to the identification of multiple single amino-acid substitutions, which may have functional consequences. This study focused on eight naturally occurring allelic variants located between amino-acid residues 60 and 334 of CCR5. All studied allelic variants were highly expressed on the cell surface of HEK-293 cells and permissive for HIV-1 infection. Variant G301V showed 3.5-fold increase in 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) for CCL4 (MIP 1beta) in a competitive binding assay. There was also a significant reduction in CCL5 (RANTES) EC(50) for the R223Q, A335V and Y339F variants. The most unexpected functional abnormality was exhibited by the R60S variant that exhibited a loss of ligand-induced desensitization in chemotaxis assays, but showed normal CCL4 and CCL5 binding avidity. This mutation is located in the first intracellular loop, a domain that has not previously been shown to be involved in receptor desensitization. In conclusion, our results support earlier studies showing that these naturally occurring point mutations do not limit HIV-1 infection, and indicated that single amino-acid changes can have unexpected functional consequences.",M1
15982312,"Type I interferons inhibit maturation and activation of mouse Langerhans cells.Type I interferons (IFN) have an essential role in antiviral defense, and they are produced upon viral infection in a variety of cells. IFN-alpha/beta treatment of immature dendritic cells (DC) is known to induce their phenotypic and functional maturation, but it remains unclear whether stimulation by this cytokine family influences the functions and maturation of Langerhans cells (LC). We used highly enriched (&gt;95%) LC directly isolated from BALB/c mouse skin and addressed this issue, comparing LC with splenic CD11c(+) DC. Type I IFN-treated LC exhibited impaired ability to produce IL-12 and inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, whereas IL-10 production was not augmented. In splenic DC, the production of inflammatory cytokines was rather enhanced by type I IFN treatment. With regard to chemokines, in both LC and splenic DC, type I IFN upregulated the production of inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5. Strikingly, IFN-beta treatment reduced the expression of CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86 on LC, whereas IFN-beta-treated splenic DC showed enhanced expression of these molecules. Furthermore, IFN-beta-treated LC had impaired costimulatory activity for anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T cells. Finally, treatment with IFN-alpha/beta reduced the migratory capacity of LC to CCL21. These results indicate that type I IFN inhibit maturation and activation of LC in a direct manner. Our observations may provide a novel explanation for the reported inability of LC to act as potent antigen-presenting cells in cutaneous and mucosal viral infection.",M1
15954896,"Chemokine response to febrile urinary tract infection.BACKGROUND: Mucosal CXC chemokines recruit inflammatory cells to the infected urinary tract. The chemokine response repertoire of the urinary tract and the relationship to disease severity have not been examined, however. METHODS: This study quantified CXC (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10) and CC (CCL2, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5) chemokines in sequential urine samples obtained from 50 patients with febrile urinary tract infections during 24 hours after diagnosis. RESULTS: All patients had elevated chemokine levels, but bacteremic infections caused higher CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, and CCL2 responses. CCL2 and CXCL8 levels were higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis symptoms and CCL2, CXCL3, CCL4, CXCL5, and CXCL10 were significantly correlated to C-reactive protein (CRP) and temperature. Women and men showed different chemokine responses. CONCLUSION: Febrile urinary tract infections are accompanied by a complex chemokine response. The response magnitude reflects disease severity, and the repertoire is influenced by gender and underlying disease.",M1
15882964,"Role of Rho family GTPases in CCR1- and CCR5-induced actin reorganization in macrophages.The beta-chemokines, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/<e>CCL4</e>, and RANTES/CCL5, play a critical role in the selective accumulation and activation of macrophages in inflamed tissues. Herein, we demonstrate that the binding of each of these beta-chemokines to their cognate receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, in either macrophages or in CCR1- or CCR5-transfected CHO cells, induced actin reorganization and the formation of lamellipodia that are characteristic of the activation of the Rho family GTPase, Rac. A dominant negative mutant of Rac, but not dominant negative mutants of RhoA or Cdc42, blocked MIP-1alpha-induced lamellipodia formation. Moreover, this MIP-1alpha-induced Rac activation and consequent lamellipodia formation is Gi- and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated. Thus, Rac activation is critical for both CCR1- and CCR5-triggered signaling cascades mediating beta-chemokine-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process essential for effective recruitment and activation of macrophages in inflammation.",M1
15879106,"CpG-independent synergistic induction of beta-chemokines and a dendritic cell phenotype by orthophosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in elutriated human primary monocytes.Chemokines attract leukocytes bearing the relevant chemokine receptors and regulate innate immune responses. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and GM-CSF are potent vaccine adjuvants and in combination induce enhanced Th1 responses by mechanisms yet to be determined. We have examined combinations of CpG- or non-CpG-ODN and GM-CSF for effects on the production of chemokines and the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells. High levels of the Th1-attracting, HIV-1-inhibitory chemokines, CCL3/MIP-1alpha and <e>CCL4</e>/MIP-1beta, were induced in human primary monocytes when CpG- or non-CpG-ODN was combined with GM-CSF, but not with IL-4 or IFN-gamma. The synergistic induction of beta-chemokines by non-CpG-ODN was phosphorothioate (PS) chemistry dependent and inhibited by blocking endosome maturation/acidification and ERK1/2 activation. Chemokine and TLR9 mRNAs were induced by PS-ODN. Cells treated with non-CpG PS-ODN and GM-CSF expressed dendritic cell marker CD83 and high levels of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules, and were CD14(-) or CD14(dim), consistent with monocyte differentiation into a dendritic cell phenotype. The induction of CD83 and beta-chemokines was tyrosine phosphorylation dependent. Secreted CCL3 and CCL4 were detected as a heterodimer. Our results indicate the CpG-independent synergy between PS-ODN and GM-CSF mediated through chemokine and dendritic cell induction. In addition, our observations suggest that PS-ODN plus GM-CSF may be useful as potent ex vivo dendritic cell differentiation/maturation agents for dendritic cell therapy and as vaccine adjuvants for tumor and infectious microorganisms, including HIV-1.",M1
15879095,"Estrogen regulates CCR gene expression and function in T lymphocytes.Estrogen has been implicated in the observed female bias in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms behind this gender dimorphism are poorly defined. We have previously reported that in vivo T cell trafficking is gender- and estrogen-dependent. Chemokine receptors are critical determinants of T cell homing and immune response. In this study, we show that the female gender is associated with increased CD4(+) T cell CCR1-CCR5 gene and protein expression in mice. The increased CCR expression correlates with enhanced in vitro chemotaxis response to MIP-1beta (<e>CCL4</e>). In vivo treatment of young oophorectomized and postmenopausal female mice with 17beta-estradiol also increased CD4(+) T cell CCR expression. Finally, 17beta-estradiol enhances tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells stimulated with MIP-1alpha in a time-dependent manner. Our results indicate an important role of estrogen in determining T cell chemokine response that may help explain the increased susceptibility and severity of autoimmune diseases in females.",M1

Our work focused on R22H, a variant of Lag-1 located near the N-loop, in the 310 turn, a domain essential for interacting with CCR5. We observed that HIV-1-infected patients from the SEROCO cohort, bearing the R22H variant either at the homozygous or heterozygous state, exhibit a worse global survival compared with wild-type homozygous individuals.",M1
15851912,"Biochemical and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of K26R, a new CCR5 Variant in China's Sichuan population.Despite multiple exposures to HIV-1, some individuals remain uninfected. This resistance to HIV infection has been associated with homozygosity for a 32-basepair deletion in the CCR5 receptor gene. This variant is frequent in caucasians but extremely rare in Asians and Africans. Identifying variations in the CCR5 gene that affect susceptibility to HIV infection in non-caucasians is therefore of great interest. In this report, we identify 5 CCR5 coding region variants in a Chinese population. The K26R mutation is an undescribed gene variant, whereas 228delK was already found in caucasians and G106R, C178R, and R223Q were previously described in Asian populations and functionally analyzed. As the function of K26R was still unknown, we focused our work on studying its chemokine receptor activity and HIV coreceptor properties compared with wild-type CCR5 and G106R, an already analyzed mutant taken as another control. We observed that K26R displayed alteration in MIP1-beta/<e>CCL4</e> and RANTES/CCL5 ligand binding and exhibited a slightly decrease for HIV coreceptor properties.",M1
15843566,"Multiple products derived from two <e>CCL4</e> loci: high incidence of a new polymorphism in HIV+ patients.Human CCL4/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta and CCL3/MIP-1alpha are two highly related molecules that belong to a cluster of inflammatory CC chemokines located in chromosome 17. CCL4 and CCL3 were formed by duplication of a common ancestral gene, generating the SCYA4 and SCYA3 genes which, in turn, present a variable number of additional non-allelic copies (SCYA4L and SCYA3L1). In this study, we show that both CCL4 loci (SCYA4 and SCYA4L) are expressed and alternatively generate spliced variants lacking the second exon. In addition, we found that the SCYA4L locus is polymorphic and displays a second allelic variant (hereinafter SCYA4L2) with a nucleotide change in the intron 2 acceptor splice site compared with the one described originally (hereinafter SCYA4L1). Therefore, the pattern of SCYA4L2 transcripts is completely different from that of SCYA4L1, since SCYA4L2 uses several new acceptor splice sites and generates nine new mRNAs. Furthermore, we analyzed the contribution of each locus (SCYA4 and SCYA4L1/L2) to total CCL4 expression in human CD8 T cells by RT-amplified fragment length polymorphism and real-time PCR, and we found that L2 homozygous individuals (L2L2) only express half the levels of CCL4 compared with L1L1 individuals. The analysis of transcripts from the SCYA4L locus showed a lower level in L2 homozygous compared with L1 homozygous individuals (12% vs 52% of total CCL4 transcripts). A possible clinical relevance of these CCL4 allelic variants was suggested by the higher frequency of the L2 allele in a group of HIV(+) individuals (n = 175) when compared with controls (n = 220, 28.6% vs 16.6% (p = 0.00016)).",M1
15831559,"MIP-1alpha[CCL3] acting on the CCR1 receptor mediates neutrophil migration in immune inflammation via sequential release of TNF-alpha and LTB4.In the present study, we investigated the involvement of macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)[CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)], MIP-1beta[<e>CCL4</e>], regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)[CCL5], and CC chemokine receptors (CCRs) on neutrophil migration in murine immune inflammation. Previously, we showed that ovalbumin (OVA)-triggered neutrophil migration in immunized mice depends on the sequential release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and leukotriene B(4)(LTB(4)). Herein, we show increased mRNA expression for MIP-1alpha[CCL3], MIP-1beta[CCL4], RANTES[CCL5], and CCR1 in peritoneal cells harvested from OVA-challenged, immunized mice, as well as MIP-1alpha[CCL3] and RANTES[CCL5] but not MIP-1beta[CCL4] proteins in the peritoneal exudates. OVA-induced neutrophil migration response was muted in immunized MIP-1alpha[CCL3](-/-) mice, but it was not inhibited by treatment with antibodies against RANTES[CCL5] or MIP-1beta[CCL4]. MIP-1alpha[CCL3] mediated neutrophil migration in immunized mice through induction of TNF-alpha and LTB(4) synthesis, as these mediators were detected in the exudates harvested from OVA-challenged immunized wild-type but not MIP-1alpha[CCL3](-/-) mice; administration of MIP-1alpha[CCL3] induced a dose-dependent neutrophil migration, which was inhibited by treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody in TNF receptor 1 (p55(-/-))-deficient mice or by MK 886 (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor); and MIP-1alpha[CCL3] failed to induce LTB(4) production in p55(-/-) mice. MIP-1alpha[CCL3] used CCR1 to promote neutrophil recruitment, as OVA or MIP-1alpha[CCL3] failed to induce neutrophil migration in CCR1(-/-) mice, in contrast to CCR5(-/-) mice. In summary, we have demonstrated that neutrophil migration observed in this model of immune inflammation is mediated by MIP-1alpha[CCL3], which via CCR1, induces the sequential release of TNF-alpha and LTB(4). Therefore, whether a similar pathway mediates neutrophil migration in human immune-inflammatory diseases, the development of specific CCR1 antagonists might have a therapeutic potential.",M1
15742158,"Not all tetramer binding CD8+ T cells can produce cytokines and chemokines involved in the effector functions of virus-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected children.In the pediatric human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection, the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is associated with a slow progression to AIDS. The secretion of cytokines by CTLs may be critical in the control of viral infection. We used the combination of cell surface and intracellular staining to study the functionality of tetramer binding CD8+ T cells recognizing two HIV-1 immunodominant epitopes, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected children. A fraction of tetramer positive CD8+ T cells produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) or chemokines (<e>CCL4</e>, CCL5) after ex vivo stimulation with the cognate peptide. There was a negative correlation between the plasma viral load and the percentage of CD8+ Tetramer Gag+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma.

15655788,"CCR5 plays a critical role in the development of myocarditis and host protection in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.The pathogenesis of myocarditis during Trypanosoma cruzi infection is poorly understood. We investigated the role played by chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the influx of T cells to the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi-infected mice. mRNA and protein for the CCR5 ligands CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5 were detected in the hearts of infected mice in association with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was a high level of CCR5 expression on CD8+ T cells in the hearts of infected mice. Moreover, CCR5 expression on CD8+ T cells was positively modulated by T. cruzi infection. CCR5-deficient mice infected with T. cruzi experienced a dramatically inhibited migration of T cells to the heart and were also more susceptible to infection. These results suggest that CCR5 and its ligands play a central role in the control of T cell influx in T. cruzi-infected mice. Knowledge of the mechanisms that trigger and control the migration of cells to the heart in patients with Chagas disease may help in the design of drugs that prevent myocarditis and protect against the development of severe disease.",M1
15634923,"Innate immunity in the human female reproductive tract: antiviral response of uterine epithelial cells to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C).The objective of this study was to examine the expression of TLR by human primary uterine epithelial cells (UEC) and to determine whether exposure to the TLR agonist poly(I:C) would induce an antiviral response. The secretion of several cytokines and chemokines was examined as well as the mRNA expression of human beta-defensin-1 and -2 (HBD1 and HBD2), IFN-beta, and the IFN-beta-stimulated genes myxovirus resistance gene 1 and 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase. The expression of TLR1-9 by UEC was demonstrated by RT-PCR, with only TLR10 not expressed. Stimulation of UEC with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) induced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, and G-CSF, as well as the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and <e>CCL4</e>/MIP-1beta. In addition, poly(I:C) exposure induced the mRNA expression of HBD1 and HBD2 by 6- and 4-fold, respectively. Furthermore, upon exposure to poly(I:C) UEC initiated a potent antiviral response resulting in the induction of IFN-beta mRNA expression 70-fold and myxovirus resistance gene 1 and 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA expression (107- and 96-fold), respectively. These results suggest that epithelial cells that line the uterine cavity are sensitive to viral infection and/or exposure to viral dsRNA released from killed epithelial cells. Not only do UEC release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that mediate the initiation of an inflammatory response and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, but they also express beta-defensins, IFN-beta, and IFN-beta-stimulated genes that can have a direct inhibiting effect on viral replication.",M1
15577536,"New CCR5 variants associated with reduced HIV coreceptor function in southeast Asia.BACKGROUND: Despite multiple exposure to HIV-1, some individuals remain uninfected. This resistance has been associated with homozygosity for a 32 base pair deletion in the gene for the CCR5 receptor. This variant occurs frequently in Caucasians but is extremely rare in Asians or Africans. OBJECTIVE: To identify variations in CCR5 receptor gene that affect susceptibility to HIV infection in non-Caucasians. METHODS: CCR5 coding region polymorphisms were screened in three groups of Vietnamese subjects: 47 HIV-1 infected intravascular drug users, 50 highly HIV-1-exposed but seronegative intravascular drug users and 37 HIV-1-unexposed seronegative individuals. DNA was analysed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography; this was followed by examination of the biochemical and HIV coreceptor properties of the coding regions. RESULTS: Five CCR5 coding region variants were identified in this Vietnamese population. The S185R, I254T and C269F mutations have not been previously described; G106R and R223Q have already been found in other Asian populations, but the functional properties of G106R is not known. These variants differed in biochemical and HIV coreceptor properties. S185R and I254T variants had receptor and coreceptor activities comparable to that of the wild type, whereas C269F and G106R behaved differently. This latter pair are poorly expressed at the cell surface, weakly bind macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (<e>CCL4</e>) and RANTES (CCL5), and display reduced HIV-1 coreceptor efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Among the five CCR5 variants found in this Vietnamese population, G106R and C269F displayed significant modifications of their receptor and coreceptor properties, which may contribute to susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and/or disease progression within this population.",M1
15567066,"CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) induces in vitro migration of GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils via CCR5-dependent activation of ERK 1/2.CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), a prototype of CC chemokines, is a potent chemoattractant toward human neutrophils pre-treated with GM-CSF for 15 min. GM-CSF-treated neutrophils migrate also to the selective CCR5 agonist <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta). CCL3- and CCL4-triggered migration of GM-CSF-primed neutrophils was inhibited by the CCR5 antagonist TAK-779. Accordingly, freshly isolated neutrophils express CCR5. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors blocked CCL3-induced migration of GM-CSF-primed neutrophils. When the activation of ERK-1/2 and p38 MAPK by CCL3 and the classical neutrophilic chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) were compared, both the chemokines were capable of activating p38 MAPK. On the contrary, whereas both ERK-1 and ERK-2 were activated by CXCL8, no ERK-1 band was detectable after CCL3 triggering. Finally, neutrophil pre-treatment with GM-CSF activated both ERK-1 and ERK-2. This suggests that by activating ERK-1, GM-CSF renders neutrophils rapidly responsive to CCL3 stimulation throughout CCR5 which is constitutively expressed on the cell surface.",M1
15546882,"CC and CX3C chemokines differentially interact with the N terminus of the human cytomegalovirus-encoded US28 receptor.Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the causative agent of life-threatening systemic diseases in immunocompromised patients as well as a risk factor for vascular pathologies, like atherosclerosis, in immunocompetent individuals. HCMV encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as US28, that displays homology to the human chemokine receptor CCR1 and binds several chemokines of the CC family as well as the CX3C chemokine fractalkine with high affinity. Most importantly, following HCMV infection, US28 activates several intracellular pathways, either constitutively or in a chemokine-dependent manner. In this study, our goal was to understand the molecular interactions between chemokines and the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor. To achieve this goal, a double approach has been used, consisting in the analysis of both receptor and ligand mutants. This approach has led us to identify several amino acids located in the N terminus of US28 that differentially contribute to the high affinity binding of CC versus CX3C chemokines. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of secondary modifications occurring at US28, such as sulfation, for ligand recognition. Finally, the effects of chemokine dimerization and interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on chemokine binding and activation of US28 were investigated as well using <e>CCL4</e> as model ligand. In line with the two-state model describing chemokine/receptor interaction, we show that an aromatic residue in the N-loop region of CCL4 promotes tight binding to US28, whereas receptor activation depends on the presence of the N terminus of CCL4, as shown previously for CCR5.",M1

Abundant functional information exists for CCL4, however, CCL4L1 has only recently been recognized as a distinct gene, thus information describing it is wanting. The CCL4L1 protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli and compared with the CCL4 protein. Competitive binding studies using HEK-293/CCR5 cells produced comparable EC50 values for the two proteins. Similarly, chemotaxis assays with cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5 revealed no substantial differences. CCL4L1 was somewhat more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in PBMCs than was CCL4, however the difference was not statistically significant. These data combined with the observation of individual variation in CCL4L1 gene copy number [Eur. J. Immunol. 32 (2002) 3016, Genomics 83 (2004) 735] support the contention that the CCL4 and CCL4L1 proteins have redundant functions.",M1
15204927,"Expression of chemokines by human fetal microglia after treatment with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Tat.Chemokines are important mediators of inflammation. It has been demonstrated that there is an increase in chemokine expression in both the sera and brain of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-1 viral protein, Tat, a transcriptional regulator, has been detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of infected individuals, and has been demonstrated to induce chemokines from various cells within the brain. The authors now show that the interaction of human microglia, the resident phagocytes of the brain, with Tat leads to dramatic increases in the secretion of the chemokines CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5. Treatment of microglia with Tat plus specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways demonstrated that the induction of each chemokine is regulated differently. Tat-induced expression of CCL2 and CCL4 was mediated by the activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, whereas the induction of CXCL8 and CCL3 was mediated only by the p38 MAPK pathway. Tat-induced CXCL10 expression was mediated, to some extent, by activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and the p38 MAPK pathway, whereas CCL5 expression was not mediated by any pathway tested. Western blot analysis demonstrated phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and Akt upon stimulation of microglia with Tat. These data suggest that a soluble HIV-1 viral protein can alter the chemokine balance in the brain, which can then lead to an influx of inflammatory cells and contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.",M1

Further, all three chemokines are potent, natural antagonists for chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and feature defensin-like, antimicrobial activities. In this study, we show that I-TAC, in addition to these effects, acts as an antagonist for CCR5. I-TAC inhibited the binding of macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)/CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) to cells transfected with CCR5 and to monocytes. Furthermore, cell migration evoked by regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 and MIP-1beta/<e>CCL4</e>, the selective agonist of CCR5, was inhibited in transfected cells and monocytes, respectively. In two other functional assays, namely the release of free intracellular calcium and actin polymerization, I-TAC reduced CCR5 activities to minimal levels. Sequence and structure analyses indicate a potential role for K17, K49, and Q51 of I-TAC in CCR5 binding. Our results expand on the potential role of I-TAC as a negative modulator in leukocyte migration and activation, as I-TAC would specifically counteract the responses mediated by many  classical,  inflammatory chemokines that act not only via CCR3 but via CCR5 as well.",M1

15122808,"Inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus infection with the CC chemokine RANTES (CCL5).Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract disease in infants, aged adults, and immunosuppressed patients. The only approved medicines for RSV disease are administration of prophylatic antibodies or treatment with a synthetic nucleoside. Both approaches are expensive and the latter is not without risk and of controversial benefit. The present investigation studied whether pharmaceutical or biologic compounds based upon chemokines might be useful in preventing RSV disease. Of interest was RANTES/CCL5, which inhibits infection by HIV strains that use chemokine receptor (CCR)-5 as co-receptor. Herein, we report that prior or simultaneous treatment of HEp-2 cells with recombinant human CCL5 provides dose-dependent inhibition of infection with RSV. Other recombinant chemokines (MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/<e>CCL4</e>, MCP-2/CCL8, eotaxin/CCL11, MIP-1delta/CCL15, stromal cell derived factor (SDF)-1alpha/CXCL12) were not inhibitory. The data suggested that CCL5 might inhibit infection by blocking fusion (F) protein-epithelial cell interactions. Infections by mutant RSV strains deleted of small hydrophobic and/or attachment proteins and only expressing F protein in the envelope were inhibited by prior treatment with CCL5 or a biologically inactive N-terminally modified met-CCL5. Inhibition was also observed when virus adsorption and treatment with CCL5 were performed at 4 degrees C. Flow cytometry further revealed that epithelial cells were positive for CCR3, but not CCR1 or CCR5. Thus, novel mimetics of CCL5 may be useful prophylatic agents to prevent respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.",M1

To determine correlations between CC-chemokines and HIV-1 disease stage or response to treatment, we examined serum levels of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES in 60 infected patients during 18 months while they were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Our results demonstrate that serum levels of MIP-1alpha and RANTES were increased in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with those in healthy controls. We found no significant differences among 4 clinical stages of HIV-1 infection in the serum levels of three CC-chemokines. Longitudinal HAART analyses revealed a pronounced decline in serum MIP-1alpha levels over time. We found no difference in this decline between HAART responders and nonresponders. These findings indicate that production of MIP-1alpha and RANTES changes during HIV-1 infection and treatment; however, our results suggest that serum levels of CC-chemokines should not be used as biomarkers for HIV-1 disease stage or response to treatment.",M1

In the present study we investigated the effects of chemokine concentration gradients on CD4+ T cell (TC4) adhesion to human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) in vitro. CCL4 or CCL5 were placed in a double chamber chemotaxis system beneath confluent resting HBMEC monolayers or cultures co-incubated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to mimic an inflammatory milieu. Chemokines readily diffused across activated HBMEC monolayers while binding to the sub-endothelial regions, establishing a chemotactic and haptotactic gradient. Naïve or resting TC4 adhered poorly to resting HBMECs compared to memory or recently activated TC4, but all subsets adhered more readily to cytokine-treated HBMECs. Chemokine gradients (10-100 ng/ml) of both CCL4 and CCL5 significantly enhanced the adhesion of memory and recently activated TC4 to cytokine-treated HBMECs, as much as doubling adhesion in a manner that correlated with chemokine receptor expression. Neither chemokine influenced adhesion to resting HBMEC monolayers nor the adhesion of resting or naïve TC4. These findings emphasize the role and importance of CNS-derived beta-chemokines in regulating the traffic of recently activated TC subsets (those previously localized to the CNS in vivo) across cytokine-activated cerebral endothelium in inflammatory diseases.",M1

In this report, we show that the full length MIP-1beta is processed by CD26/DPPIV to the truncated form and that cleavage can be blocked by DPPIV inhibitory peptides derived from HIV Tat(1-9) or the thromboxane A2 receptor, TAX2-R(1-9). Addition of Tat(1-9) or TAX2-R(1-9) peptides to PBL cultures partially blocks endogenous MIP-1beta processing. The kinetics of conversion of MIP-1beta from intact to MIP-1beta(3-69) in activated PBLs correlates with cell surface expression of CD26. Our results suggest that NH2-terminal processing of MIP-1beta and possibly other chemokines may depend on the balance between CD26/DPPIV enzymatic activity and cellular and viral proteins that modulate enzyme function.",M1
14761932,"Reduced GRK2 level in T cells potentiates chemotaxis and signaling in response to <e>CCL4</e>.Chemokine receptors belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Phosphorylation of GPCR by GPCR kinases (GRKs) is considered to play an important role in desensitization of these receptors. We have recently shown in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that the level of GRK2 in lymphocytes is reduced by approximately 50%. However, the physiological relevance of reduced GRK2 levels in lymphocytes is not known. Here, we investigated whether reduced GRK2 expression changes the chemotactic response of T cells to the chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Activated T cells from GRK2+/- mice, which have a 50% reduction in GRK2 protein levels, showed a significant 40% increase in chemotaxis toward the CCR5 ligand CCL4. In addition, chemotaxis toward the CCR1 and CCR5 ligands CCL3 and CCL5 was also increased. Binding of CCL4 to activated T cells from GRK2+/- and wild-type (WT) mice was similar, but agonist-induced CCR5 phosphorylation was attenuated in GRK2+/- cells. Moreover, the calcium response and phosphorylation of protein kinase B and extracellular-regulated kinase in response to CCL4 were significantly increased in GRK2+/- T cells, showing that signaling is increased when the level of GRK2 is reduced. GRK2+/- and WT cells do become refractory to restimulation with CCL4. In conclusion, a 50% decrease in T cell GRK2 expression results in increased responsiveness to CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, suggesting that the 50% reduction in lymphocyte GRK2 level as observed during inflammation can have functional consequences for the response of these cells to chemokines.",M1
14735149,"Evidence for a cluster of genes on chromosome 17q11-q21 controlling susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy in Brazilians.The region of conserved synteny on mouse chromosome 11/human 17q11-q21 is known to carry a susceptibility gene(s) for intramacrophage pathogens. The region is rich in candidates including NOS2A, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, <e>CCL4</e>/MIP-1beta, CCL5/RANTES, CCR7, STAT3 and STAT5A/5B. To examine the region in man, we studied 92 multicase tuberculosis (627 individuals) and 72 multicase leprosy (372 individuals) families from Brazil. Multipoint nonparametric analysis (ALLEGRO) using 16 microsatellites shows two peaks of linkage for leprosy at D17S250 (Z(lr) score 2.34; P=0.01) and D17S1795 (Z(lr) 2.67; P=0.004) and a single peak for tuberculosis at D17S250 (Z(lr) 2.04; P=0.02). Combined analysis shows significant linkage (peak Z(lr) 3.38) at D17S250, equivalent to an allele sharing LOD score 2.48 (P=0.0004). To determine whether one or multiple genes contribute, 49 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms were typed in candidate genes. Family-based allelic association testing that was robust to family clustering demonstrated significant associations with tuberculosis susceptibility at four loci separated by intervals (NOS2A-8.4 Mb-CCL18-32.3 kb-CCL4-6.04 Mb-STAT5B) up to several Mb. Stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis using a case/pseudo-control data set showed that the four genes contributed separate main effects, consistent with a cluster of susceptibility genes across 17q11.2.",M1
14673550,"Independent expression of the two paralogous <e>CCL4</e> genes in monocytes and B lymphocytes.The CCL4 chemokine is secreted by a variety of cells following stimulation. CCL4 affects several different types of cells that are important for acute inflammatory responses and are critical for the development of specific immune responses to foreign antigens. The human genome contains two genes for the CCL4 chemokine. Although highly homologous, the two genes encode slightly different proteins. We analyzed the mRNA expressed in monocytes and B lymphocytes and found that while monocytes express predominantly one CCL4 gene, known as ACT-2, peripheral blood B lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and the second CCL4 gene, lymphocyte activating gene-1 ( LAG-1). Although peripheral blood B cells, CD27(-) B cells, and CD27(+) B cells all express a mixture of LAG-1 and ACT-2, the B-cell lines that were studied regulate the two genes independently. RL, SU-DHL-6, and REH cells predominantly express LAG-1. These studies demonstrate that monocytes and B cells utilize different mechanisms to regulate expression of the two CCL4 genes and suggest that the two genes may not have identical activities.",M1
14597406,"Inhibition of chemokine receptor function by membrane cholesterol oxidation.Membrane cholesterol is required to maintain chemokine receptor conformation and function for CXCR4 and CCR5. We previously demonstrated that chemokines preferentially bind to receptors within lipid rafts, which are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains. To further elucidate the role of cholesterol in chemokine receptor function, we examined the effects of membrane cholesterol oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (CO), which enzymatically converts cholesterol to 4-cholesten-3-one. Here, we demonstrate that CO treatment (0.25-2.0 U/ml) of human T cells inhibits CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) and <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta) binding to cell surface CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, resulting in the inhibition of chemokine-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. The effects were significantly enhanced by cotreatment with low-dose sphingomyelinase (SMase) (0.125 mU/ml), which produced little inhibitory effect by itself. CO and SMase treatment also inhibited HIV-1 infection through CXCR4, but not virus replication. Similar to the removal of membrane cholesterol, CO/SMase treatment induced conformation changes in the chemokine receptors as detected by differential loss in binding of epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. We conclude that the native form of cholesterol with the hydroxyl group at C3 is critical to CXCR4 and CCR5 conformation and function.",M1
12960284,"Prostaglandin E2 inhibits production of the inflammatory chemokines CCL3 and <e>CCL4</e> in dendritic cells.Dendritic cells bridge innate and adaptive immunity and participate in both responses. Upon capture of pathogens, dendritic cells release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, attracting other immune cells to the infection site. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory neuropeptides, and lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) limit and control the inflammatory response. In this study we report that exogenous PGE2 inhibits CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) expression and release from dendritic cells stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, or peptidoglycan, a TLR2 ligand. The inhibition is dose-dependent and occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels. The inhibitory effect is mediated through EP2 and EP4 receptors and requires the presence of PGE2 at the time of LPS stimulation. Intraperitoneal administration of PGE2 together with LPS results in a reduction in the levels of CCL3 and CCL4 released in the peritoneal fluid, a reduction in the number of dendritic cells accumulating in the peritoneal cavity, and a reduction in CCL3 amount per cell in the peritoneal cell population. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which endogenous PGE2 acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, is the inhibition of inflammatory chemokine release from activated dendritic cells, preventing the excess accumulation of activated immune cells.",M1
12704138,"CC chemokines mediate leukocyte trafficking into the central nervous system during murine neurocysticercosis: role of gamma delta T cells in amplification of the host immune response.According to a previous report, the degree of the host immune response highly correlates with severity of the disease in the murine model for neurocysticercosis. In wild-type mice, Mesocestoides corti infection induced a rapid and extensive accumulation of gamma delta T cells and macrophages in the brain. NK cells, dendritic cells, alpha beta T cells, and B cells were also recruited to the brain but at lower levels. In contrast, gamma delta T-cell-deficient mice exhibited decreased cellular infiltration and reduced central nervous system (CNS) pathology. To understand the mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment into the CNS, chemokine expression was analyzed in infected brains in the present study. MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1 alpha (CCL3), and MIP-1 beta (<e>CCL4</e>) were up-regulated within 2 days after M. corti infection. Protein expression of RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11), and MIP-2 was detected later, at 1 week postinfection. Correlating with the decreased cellular infiltration, delta chain T-cell receptor-deficient (TCR delta(-/-)) mice exhibited substantially reduced levels of most of the chemokines analyzed (with the exception of eotaxin). The results suggest that gamma delta T cells play an important role in the CNS immune response by producing chemokines such as MCP-1 and MIP-1 alpha, enhancing leukocyte trafficking into the brain during murine neurocysticercosis.",M1
12651617,"Potential interaction between CCR1 and its ligand, CCL3, induced by endogenously produced interleukin-1 in human hepatomas.Hepatoma cell lines can produce a massive amount of chemokines in response to various stimuli including hepatitis viruses and their products. However, it remains elusive on the types of chemokine receptor(s) expressed in the hepatoma tissues and its roles in hepatoma development. To clarify these points, we examined the chemokine receptor expression in six human hepatoma cell lines. All of the hepatoma cell lines constitutively and exclusively expressed CCR1 mRNA and its protein on their cell surface. CCR1 expression was also detected on hepatoma cells and to a lesser degree, on endothelial cells in hepatoma tissues but not in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, CCL3 expression was detected in hepatoma cells, endothelial cells, and to a lesser degree, fibroblast-like cells in hepatoma tissue, whereas only occasional vascular endothelial cells and inflammatory cells in normal liver tissues were weakly positive for CCL3. Moreover, the forskolin-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations were inhibited by the ligands for CCR1, CCL3, <e>CCL4</e>, and CCL5, suggesting that the expressed CCR1 was functional. Four hepatoma cell lines produced CCL3 only in response to interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Finally, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were detected abundantly in hepatoma tissues but not in normal liver tissues. Thus, IL-1 may enhance the local production of CCL3, which may interact with CCR1 expressed on hepatoma cells, in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner.",M1
12651610,"Cathepsin D specifically cleaves the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and SLC that are expressed in human breast cancer.Cathepsin D (Cath-D) expression in human primary breast cancer has been associated with a poor prognosis. In search of a better understanding of the Cath-D substrates possibly involved in cancer invasiveness and metastasis, we investigated the potential interactions between this protease and chemokines. Here we report that purified Cath-D, as well as culture supernatants from the human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, selectively degrade macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha (CCL3), MIP-1 beta (<e>CCL4</e>), and SLC (CCL21). Proteolysis was totally blocked by the protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and specificity of Cath-D cleavage was demonstrated using a large chemokine panel. Whereas MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta degradation was rapid and complete, cleavage of SLC was slow and not complete. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Cath-D cleaves the Leu(58) to Trp(59) bond of SLC producing two functionally inactive fragments. Analysis of Cath-D proteolysis of a series of monocyte chemoattractant protein-3/MIP-1 beta hybrids indicated that processing of MIP-1 beta might start by cleaving off amino acids located in the C-terminal domain. In situ hybridization studies revealed MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and Cath-D gene expression mainly in the stromal compartment of breast cancers whereas SLC transcripts were found in endothelial cells of capillaries and venules within the neoplastic tissues. Cath-D production in the breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of culture supernatants and cell lysates, was not affected by stimulation with chemokines such as interleukin-8 (CXCL8), SDF-1 (CXCL12), and SLC. These data suggest that inactivation of chemokines by Cath-D possibly influences regulatory mechanisms in the tumoral extracellular microenvironment that in turn may affect the generation of the antitumoral immune response, the migration of cancer cells, or both processes.",M1
12634395,"Interleukin-7-dependent production of RANTES that correlates with human immunodeficiency virus disease progression.There is a relationship between CD4-T-cell number and circulating interleukin 7 (IL-7) levels in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. Here, we show that IL-7 induced a dose-dependent production of CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), <e>CCL4</e> (MIP-1beta), and CCL5 (RANTES) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), ex vivo tonsil lymphoid tissue of HIV(-) individuals, and PBMC from HIV(+) individuals, suggesting that IL-7 may regulate beta-chemokine production in vivo. In a cross-sectional study of HIV(+) individuals (n = 130), a weak but significant correlation between IL-7 and RANTES was noted (r = 0.379; P &lt; 0.001). Remarkably, the correlation between IL-7 and RANTES increased to an r value of 0.798 (P &lt; 0.001) if individuals with low CD4 cell counts (&lt;200 cells/ micro l) were excluded from the analysis. Our results suggest that there is a relationship between IL-7 and the production of RANTES both in vitro and in vivo that is lost in immune-compromised patients (CD4 count of &lt;200 cells/ micro l) but that could be restored by antiretroviral therapy. Unlike the case for IL-7, high levels of RANTES suggest an intermediate stage of HIV disease progression.",M1
12502723,"Heterologous desensitization of T cell functions by CCR5 and CXCR4 ligands: inhibition of cellular signaling, adhesion and chemotaxis.T cells migrate into inflamed sites through the extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to chemotactic areas and are then simultaneously or sequentially exposed to multiple chemotactic ligands. We examined the responses of human peripheral blood T cells, present in an ECM-like context, to combinatorial signaling transduced by SDF-1alpha (CXCL12), and two CCR5 ligands, RANTES (CCL5) and MIP-1beta (<e>CCL4</e>). Separately, these chemokines, at G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulating concentrations, induced T cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and T cell chemotaxis. However, the pro-adhesive and pro-migratory capacities of SDF-1alpha and RANTES or MIP-1beta were mutually suppressed by the simultaneous or sequential exposure of the cells to these CCR5 or CXCR4 ligands. This cross-talk did not involve the internalization of the SDF-1alpha receptor, CXCR4, but rather, a decrease in phosphorylation of ERK and Pyk-2, as well as inhibition of Ca(2+) mobilization. Strikingly, early CXCR4 signaling of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, detected by SDF-1alpha-induced AKT phosphorylation, was insensitive to RANTES-CCR5 signals. Accordingly, early chemotaxis to SDF-1alpha was not susceptible to CCR5 occupancy, whereas late stages of T cell chemotaxis were markedly down-regulated. This is an example of a specialized functional desensitization of heterologous chemokine receptors that induces GPCR interference with T cell adhesion to ECM ligands and chemotaxis within chemokine-rich extravascular contexts.",M1

METHODS: SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with 50% <e>CCl4</e> (Carbon tetrachloride) olive solution every three days for 6 or 10 weeks. Then they were divided into two groups randomly and injected with D-galactosamine (D-gal) at a dose of 2 g/kg, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100 pg/kg and D-gal at a dose of 0.5 g/kg BW respectively. The levels of serum ALT, AST and TBil were detected,and histopathological changes were observed to evaluate these two models. RESULTS: After injection of 50% CCl4 olive solution intraperitoneally for 6 weeks, liver fibrosis happened in SD rats, 10 weeks, cirrhosis happened. Pelleta necrosis and massive or submassive necrosis was seen administration of two reagents mentioned above. CONCLUSION: By injecting of 50% CCl4 olive solution intraperitoneally, acute-on-chronic liver failure model could be induced by D-gal, LPS/D-gal in rats.",M2
20299743,"Increasing early insulin secretion compensate adequately for hepatic insulin resistance in <e>CCl4</e>-induced cirrhosis rats.A number of recent publications have reported an increased frequency prevalence of glucose intolerance with hyperinsulinemia in liver cirrhosis. The aim of this work was to detect, in CCl(4)-induced liver cirrhosis rat, the presence and starting point of muscle and liver insulin resistance. Eighteen rats received intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of soybean oil containing of CCl(4) twice a week for 20 weeks. We executed standard oral glucose tolerance and clamp study to evaluate systemic insulin resistance. Hepatic glucose uptake was much lower in CCl(4) group than that in control group, but peripheral glucose uptake was not decreased in this study. In contrast, early-phase insulin secretion was enhanced in CCl(4) rat using oral glucose load during clamp methods. These data suggested that increased early insulin secretion compensate adequately for hepatic insulin resistance in rats. However there was a report that peripheral glucose uptake was decreased in the case of human liver cirrhosis, which was formed in the course of time. In a chronic condition, this may be associated with reduced insulin content and developed systemic insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis. Then a long term observation study will be required to examine the presence of muscle insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis.",M2
20184502,"No contribution of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells to capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids accompanied by hepatic differentiation in carbon tetrachloride-induced mouse liver fibrosis.BACKGROUND AIMS: The acceleration of capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids after cell therapy would not be beneficial to restoration after liver disease. The goal was to observe the effects of umbilical cord (UC)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on liver microcirculation and their therapeutic potential in liver fibrosis. METHODS: Human UC MSC labeled with or without CM-DIL were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice with carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced chronic liver fibrosis models. Because of the high autofluorescence on the injured liver sections, we used immunohistochemistry, Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but not immunofluorescence, in order to avoid false images under a confocal fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: Human-specific alpha-fetoprotein and albumin mRNA and proteins were detected in CCl4-treated mouse livers receiving human UC MSC transplants. We only observed the gene expression of human-specific endothelial-like cells markers CD31 and KDR by RT-PCR, but not protein expression by immunohistochemistry, in UC MSC-transplanted mouse livers. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in injured livers 4 weeks after UC MSC transplantation was higher than in normal livers. However, UC MSC injection did not increase significantly the vascular density labeled by CD31 and (vWF) in the injured livers of UC MSC-transplanted mice compared with non-transplanted mice after CCl4 treatment. In addition, liver function was partly improved after UC MSC transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Human UC MSC can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells but do not accelerate the capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids, finally leading to the partial improvement of liver function in mice with CCl4-mediated chronic liver fibrosis.",M2
20164648,"Photolysis of Br2 in <e>CCl4</e> studied by time-resolved X-ray scattering.A time-resolved X-ray solution scattering study of bromine molecules in CCl(4) is presented as an example of how to track atomic motions in a simple chemical reaction. The structures of the photoproducts are tracked during the recombination process, geminate and non-geminate, from 100 ps to 10 micros after dissociation. The relaxation of hot Br(2)(*) molecules heats the solvent. At early times, from 0.1 to 10 ns, an adiabatic temperature rise is observed, which leads to a pressure gradient that forces the sample to expand. The expansion starts after about 10 ns with the laser beam sizes used here. When thermal artefacts are removed by suitable scaling of the transient solvent response, the excited-state solute structures can be obtained with high fidelity. The analysis shows that 30% of Br(2)(*) molecules recombine directly along the X potential, 60% are trapped in the A/A' state with a lifetime of 5.5 ns, and 10% recombine non-geminately via diffusive motion in about 25 ns.

Following repeated administration of 0.2 ml/kg CCl(4) twice a week for 1 and 3 months, the LD(50) values were over 2.0 and 0.72 ml/kg, respectively. A single administration of 0.2 ml/kg CCl(4) induced, within 24 h, apoptotic death of liver cells in the centrilobular zone 3 that were observed positive in cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). However, after repeated exposure to 0.2 ml/kg twice a week for 1 month, cells in the centrilobular area were almost completely replaced with CYP2E1-negative cells. These cells were tolerant to CCl(4). After 3 months of exposure, a considerable number of CYP2E1-positive hepatocytes were observed throughout the periportal zone 1 and intermediate zone 2. Thus, fluctuations in CYP2E1-positive cells during chronic exposure to low doses of CCl(4) induced tolerance, which can be partially lost after prolonged CCl(4) exposure.",M2
20122671,"Simple and effective method for producing [11C]phosgene using an environmental <e>CCl4</e> gas detection tube.INTRODUCTION: Carbon-11-labeled phosgene is an important labeling precursor for PET molecular probes. Despite the usefulness of [(11)C]phosgene, some difficulties, especially in the formation of [(11)C]phosgene process from [(11)C]CCl(4), hamper its use. The present article shows a simple preparation method for [(11)C]phosgene. METHOD: [(11)C]CCl(4) was obtained using the conventional method by passing a mixture of [(11)C]CH(4) and Cl(2) through a heated quartz tube. The [(11)C]CCl(4) was transformed to [(11)C]phosgene simply by passing through a pretreatment tube of a Kitagawa gas detection system for the working-environmental CCl(4) concentration measurement at room temperature with a flow rate of 50 ml/min. RESULT: This tube successfully transformed [(11)C]CCl(4) to [(11)C]phosgene at room temperature. [(11)C]Phosgene was obtained at nearly 80% radiochemical yield (EOB) in a short synthesis time with high reproducibility.

20113491,"Ultrasound imaging in an experimental model of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in rats.BACKGROUND: Domestic dogs and cats are very well known to develop chronic hepatic diseases, including hepatic lipidosis and cirrhosis. Ultrasonographic examination is extensively used to detect them. However, there are still few reports on the use of the ultrasound B-mode scan in correlation with histological findings to evaluate diffuse hepatic changes in rodents, which represent the most important animal group used in experimental models of liver diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of ultrasound findings in the assessment of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis when compared to histological results in Wistar rats by following up a murine model of chronic hepatic disease. RESULTS: Forty Wistar rats (30 treated, 10 controls) were included. Liver injury was induced by dual exposure to <e>CCl4</e> and ethanol for 4, 8 and 15 weeks. Liver echogenicity, its correlation to the right renal cortex echogenicity, measurement of portal vein diameter (PVD) and the presence of ascites were evaluated and compared to histological findings of hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis. Liver echogenicity correlated to hepatic steatosis when it was greater or equal to the right renal cortex echogenicity, with a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 76.9% respectively, and accuracy of 92.5%. Findings of heterogeneous liver echogenicity and irregular surface correlated to liver cirrhosis with a sensitivity of 70.6%, specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 82.1% respectively, and accuracy of 87.5%. PVD was significantly increased in both steatotic and cirrhotic rats; however, the later had greater diameters. PVD cut-off point separating steatosis from cirrhosis was 2.1 mm (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90.5%). One third of cirrhotic rats presented with ascites. CONCLUSION: The use of ultrasound imaging in the follow-up of murine diffuse liver disease models is feasible and efficient, especially when the studied parameters are used in combination. The potential implication of this study is to provide a non-invasive method that allows follow-up studies of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis of individual rats for pre-clinical drug or cell based therapies.",M2
20079818,"Comparative evaluation of the protective potentials of human paraoxonase 1 and 3 against <e>CCl4</e>-induced liver injury.We previously reported that electroporation mediated hPON1 or hPON3 gene delivery could protect against CCl(4)-induced liver injury. However, substantial evidence supported that the in vivo physiological functions of hPON1 and hPON3 were distinct. To compare the protective efficacies of hPON1 and hPON3 against liver injury, recombinant adenovirus AdPON1 and AdPON3, which were capable of expressing hPON1 and hPON3 respectively, were intravenously injected into mice before they were given CCl(4). Adenovirus mediated expression of hPON1 and hPON3 were demonstrated by elevated serum esterase activity, hepatic lactonase activity, and hPON1/hPON3 mRNA expression in liver. Serum transaminase assay, histological observation and TUNEL analysis revealed that the extent of liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in AdPON1 or AdPON3 treated mice was significantly ameliorated in comparison with control. Meanwhile, overexpression of hPON1 and hPON3 reduced the hepatic oxidative stress and strengthen the total antioxidant capabilities in liver through affecting the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) levels, regardless of the exposure to CCl(4) or corn oil. Administration of AdPON1 or AdPON3 also suppressed inflammatory response by decreasing TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in CCl(4) mice. In this study, hPON1 exhibited a slightly higher efficacy than hPON3 in alleviating liver injury, but the difference between them were not significant.",M2
20079350,"Antifibrotic effects of chronic baicalein administration in a <e>CCl4</e> liver fibrosis model in rats.Baicalein was a major bioactive flavonoid derived from Radix Scutellariae in Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang which was commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis in China. The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic baicalein administration could prevent liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in rats and investigate its possible protective mechanism. The antifibrotic effects of baicalein were assessed directly by hepatic histology and indirectly by measuring levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatic hyaluronic acid, laminin and procollagen type III (PCIII) in serum, as well as hydroxyproline and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in liver. In addition, we further investigated protein synthesis of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor which has been identified as attractive target for therapeutic intervention. CCl(4) treatment increased levels of AST, ALT, hyaluronic acid, laminin, and PCIII in serum, as well as hydroxyproline and MMPs in liver. Baicalein treatment (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg for 10 weeks) dose-dependently decreased levels of these markers. Baicalein also reduced inflammation, destruction of liver architecture, and collagen accumulation and significantly inhibited protein synthesis of PDGF-beta receptor. Together, our results suggest that chronic baicalein administration inhibits stellate cell activation and proliferation by the down-regulation of PDGF-beta receptor and prevents the development of CCl(4) induced liver fibrosis in rats.",M2
19966836,"Antifibrotic effects of ZK14, a novel nitric oxide-donating biphenyldicarboxylate derivative, on rat HSC-T6 cells and <e>CCl4</e>-induced hepatic fibrosis.AIM: To study the pharmacologic effect of ZK(14), a novel nitric oxide-donating biphenyldicarboxylate (DDB) derivative, on HSC-T6 cells and on CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis. METHODS: Inhibition of HSC-T6 cell growth by ZK(14) was evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of ZK(14) on the percentage of HSC-T6 cells undergoing apoptosis was measured using Annexin-V/PI double-staining and TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase activities were tested. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with 14% CCl(4). Rats with hepatic fibrosis were randomly divided into four groups: model control, ZK(14) (20 mg/kg), ZK(14) (10 mg/kg) and DDB (5 mg/kg). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hyaluronic acid (HA), type III collagen (PCIII), and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed, and liver samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The NO level in cells treated with ZK(14) in vitro was also measured. RESULTS: The effect of ZK(14) on HSC-T6 cell apoptosis was concentration- and time-dependent, with up to 50% of cells becoming apoptotic when exposed to 100 mumol/L ZK(14) for 18 h. ZK(14) treatment resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of caspases 3 and 9. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, ZK(14) significantly decreased serum transaminase (AST, ALT) activities and fibrotic index (HA, PCIII) levels and significantly inhibited fibrogenesis. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that ZK(14), a novel NO-donating DDB derivative, promotes HSC-T6 apoptosis in vitro through a signaling mechanism involving mitochondria and caspase activation and it inhibits CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis in vivo. The results suggest that ZK(14) has potential therapeutic value in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",M2
19950858,"[Comparative morphofunctional analysis of rat hepatocyte cultures isolated from the normal and pathologically changed liver due to experimental toxic hepatitis]The goal of the study was to examine the state of primary hepatocytes of rats with toxic hepatitis induced by combination of <e>CCl4</e> and ethanol. Fluorescent immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that normal and pathologic hepatocytes in culture formed actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. To investigate morphology and localization of mitochondria the hepatocytes were stained with Rhodamine 123. Glycogen and DNA contents in hepatocytes were determined by fluorescent cytophotometry during the lifetime of the culture. Cells were maintained for 5 days, and there were no changes in ploidy distribution observed. The mean ploidy was not changed too. Thus hepatocytes of different ploidy demonstrated similar survival rate. The glycogen content was 50% higher in experimental group compared to the control. The glycogen content decreased in control and cyrrotic hepatocytes after collagenase isolation. It has been found that the control hepatocytes accumulated glycogen within 3 days. On the contrary, the glycogen levels remained to be low in the pathologic hepatocytes.",M2
19950531,"Attenuation of carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity by cow urine distillate in rats.OBJECTIVE: To study the carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatoprotective activity in cow urine. METHODS: Effect of cow urine distillate on liver function was studied in vivo in rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>). Hepatotoxicity was induced by a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of CCl4 in olive oil (5 mL/kg i.p). Protective effect of cow urine distillate (in three dose levels) and standard drug Silymarin (100 mg/kg, p.o) on liver function were studied in intoxicated rats. Parameters in the study included liver function tests and histological observations. RESULTS: The cow urine distillate decreased the levels of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT, and total bilirubin in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05) as sylimarin. CONCLUSION: The observed protective effects of cow urine distillate on liver function might be due to the presence of antioxidants in cow urine.",M2
19928576,"[Effects of hypoxen on morphological and functional state of the liver under of exogenous intoxication conditions]The effects of hypoxen on the metabolic processes in the liver tissue have been investigated on experimental animals (rats) with model tetrachloromethane (<e>CCl4</e>) induced toxic liver damage. It is established that the drug decreases the activity of transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase, the total bilirubin level in the blood serum, and the rate of free-radical lipid oxidation in the liver. These effects of hypoxen can be considered as manifestations of the hepatoprotective activity. The efficiency of the drug under conditions of CCl4 intoxication was confirmed by the results of a histological examination.",M2
19927273,"Effects of Athamanta turbith fruit essential oils on <e>CCl4</e>-induced hepatic failure in mice and their antioxidant properties.The effects of essential oils isolated from mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica (Borbás) Tutin and A. turbith ssp. haynaldii (Borbás &amp; Uechtr.) Tutin (Umbelliferae) on some liver biochemical parameters in mice intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride were investigated. Pretreatment with both essential oils extenuated the effects caused by carbon tetrachloride. In order to investigate in vitro antioxidant properties of the oils, three methods were applied: scavenging of both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and OH radicals, as well as a test of inhibition of Fe(2+)/ascorbic-induced lipid peroxidation. Investigated essential oils exhibited modest antioxidant capacity. Therefore, their influence on biochemical parameters in intoxicated animals might be linked to the inhibition of enzymes (cytochrome P450 2E1) involved in metabolic activation of halomethanes.",M2
19899326,"Comparative effects of vitamin E and kolaviron (a biflavonoid from Garcinia kola) on carbon tetrachloride-induced renal oxidative damage in mice.It became evident in this study that carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>), can induce renal oxidative damage. The hepatoprotective effects of vitamin E (Vit. E) and kolaviron (KV), a biflavonoid complex from the seeds of Garcinia kola are well documented. The present study was designed to investigate and compare the renal protective effects of Vit. E and KV in mice given CCl4 (1.2 g kg(-1)) intra-peritoneally thrice a week for two weeks. CCl4 caused a marked increase in serum and renal lipid peroxidation (LPO) by 106 and 225%, respectively. Treatment with KV at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) and Vit. E at 100 mg kg(-1) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased the CCl4-mediated increase in LPO. Furthermore, CCl4-intoxication decreased the levels of renal reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) by 44, 56 and 43%, respectively. Treatment with KV and Vit. E significantly (p &lt; 0.05) ameliorated the GSH and SOD levels. Specifically, KV at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) increased GSH by 32 and 27% and SOD levels by 50 and 53%, respectively. Likewise, treatment with Vit. E increased GSH and SOD levels by 31 and 53%, respectively. Effects on markers of renal functions showed that CCl4-intoxication significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated serum urea and creatinine by 287 and 186%, respectively. While treatment with Vit. E decreased serum urea and creatinine by 60 and 55%, respectively, KV produced insignificant (p &gt; 0.05) effect on these parameters. This study found KV unable to protect against CCl4-induced renal damage but confirmed the potency of Vit. E to enhance recovery from renal oxidative damage.",M2
19853952,"A novel model of <e>CCl4</e>-induced cirrhosis with ascites in the mouse.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The current approaches to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of liver diseases often rely on the use of transgenic mice. However, experimental models of decompensated cirrhosis have not been clearly established in mice. Thus, we aimed to set an efficient and well-tolerated protocol to induce cirrhosis in mice able to progress up to the ascitic stage. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice received CCl(4) subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or by inhalation. In the latter group, gaseous CCl(4) was administered according to three different schedules: increasing exposure times, twice weekly (traditional protocol; TP), short inhalation cycles, twice or three times weekly. RESULTS: Portal hypertension, sodium retention, and ascites developed in all groups between 11 and 15 weeks. Mortality reached 70% in the TP group, but it was only 0-10% with all other protocols. All the inhalation groups had significantly more ascites at sacrifice than those receiving CCl(4) subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. Extensive abdominal adhesions and evidence of enhanced hepatic inflammation, as suggested by the increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver tissue, were found in the intraperitoneal group, while large granulomas at the injection site and marked neutrophil infiltration of lungs developed in the subcutaneous group. No extra-hepatic damage could be detected in mice inhaling CCl(4). CONCLUSIONS: The use of short cycles of CCl(4) inhalation represents a novel, safe, and effective method to induce decompensated cirrhosis in mice. Intraperitoneal CCl(4) leads instead to abdominal adhesions precluding a correct evaluation of ascites, while subcutaneous CCl(4) causes an unwanted systemic inflammatory response.",M2
19827746,"Protective effect of Pleurotus cornucopiae mushroom extract on carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity.Pleurotus cornucopiae (PC) mushrooms are found in the field and commonly known in Japan as Tamogidake mushrooms. The present study investigated the protective effects of an aqueous extract of PC on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced hepatotoxicity and the possible mechanism involved in this protection including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1. Wistar rats were pretreated with aqueous extracts of PC (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 8 days prior to the intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg) or corn oil. Pretreatment with PC mushroom extract significantly prevented the increased serum enzyme activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in a dose-dependent manner, and suppressed the expression of CYP2E1. PC mushroom extract also protected hepatocytes from the damage effects of CCl4 as remarked by histological and electromicroscopical findings. It was concluded that repeated daily doses of aqueous extracts of PC mushroom reduced the toxic effects exerted by CCl4 on the liver.",M2
19827016,"Oxidative stress modulation by Rosmarinus officinalis in <e>CCl4</e>-induced liver cirrhosis.Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiaceae) possesses antioxidant activity and hepatoprotective effects, and so may provide a possible therapeutic alternative for chronic liver disease. The effect produced by a methanolic extract of Rosmarinus officinalis on CCl(4)-induced liver cirrhosis in rats was investigated using both prevention and reversion models. Over the course of the development of cirrhosis, the increased enzymatic activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase, and the rise in bilirubin levels caused by CCl(4) administration, were prevented by Rosmarinus officinalis co-administration. When the cirrhosis by oxidative stress was evaluated as an increase on liver lipoperoxidation, total lipid peroxides, nitric oxide in serum, and loss of erythrocyte plasma membrane stability, R. officinalis was shown to prevent such alterations. On cirrhotic animals treated with CCl(4), histological studies showed massive necrosis, periportal inflammation and fibrosis which were modified by R. officinalis. These benefits on experimental cirrhosis suggest a potential therapeutic use for R. officinalis as an alternative for liver cirrhosis.",M2
19822030,"Protective effect of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) on hepatic steatosis and damage induced by carbon tetrachloride in Wistar rats.The present study was planned to investigate the protective effect of 10 % and 20 % apricot-containing feed on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced hepatic steatosis and damage. Adult male Wistar rats (n 42) were divided into six groups of seven each, as follows: control group; CCl4 group; CCl4+10 % apricot group; CCl4+20 % apricot group; 10 % apricot group; 20 % apricot group. All apricot groups were fed with 10 % or 20 % apricot-containing feed for 5 months. CCl4 injections were applied to the CCl4 groups at the dose of 1 mg/kg for 3 d at the end of 5 months. In the CCl4 group, vacuolated hepatocytes and hepatic necrosis were seen, especially in the centrilobular area. Hepatocytes showed an oedematous cytoplasmic matrix, large lipid globules and degenerated organelles. The area of liver injury was found significantly decreased with apricot feeding. Malondialdehyde and total glutathione levels and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly changed in the CCl4 group and indicated increased oxidative stress. Apricot feeding decreased this oxidative stress and ameliorated histological damage. We concluded that apricot feeding had beneficial effects on CCl4-induced liver steatosis and damage probably due to its antioxidant nutrient (beta-carotene and vitamin) contents and high radical-scavenging capacity. Dietary intake of apricot can reduce the risk of liver steatosis and damage caused by free radicals.",M2
19775072,"Hepatoprotective effect of Carissa carandas Linn root extract against <e>CCl4</e> and paracetamol induced hepatic oxidative stress.Oral pre-treatment with ethanolic extract of the roots of C. carandas (ERCC; 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, po) showed significant hepatoprotective activity against CCl4 and paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing the activities of serum marker enzymes, bilirubin and lipid peroxidation, and significant increase in the levels of uric acid, glutathione, super oxide dismutase, catalase and protein in a dose dependent manner, which was confirmed by the decrease in the total weight of the liver and histopathological examination. Data also showed that ERCC possessed strong antioxidant activity, which may probably lead to the promising hepatoprotective activities of C. carandas root extract. These findings therefore supported the traditional belief on hepatoprotective effect of the roots of C. carandas.",M2

19756695,"Global gene expression profiling reveals a key role of CD44 in hepatic oval-cell reaction after 2-AAF/<e>CCl4</e> injury in rodents.Liver progenitors, so-called oval cells, proliferate remarkably from periportal areas after severe liver injury when hepatocyte regeneration is compromised. These cells invade far into the liver parenchyma. Molecular mechanisms underlying these behaviors of oval cells remain poorly understood. In this study, we treated rats with 2-acetylaminofluorene/carbon tetrachloride to induce hepatic oval cells. By expression microarray analysis, we investigated global gene expression profiles in liver tissue, with an emphasis on adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), growth factors/cytokines, and receptors that might contribute to the distinct behaviors of oval cells. Genes upregulated at least twofold were selected. We then performed immunostaining to verify the microarray results and identified expression of MMP-7 and CD44 in oval cells. Staining of cytokeratin (CK)-19, an oval-cell marker, was similar between oval cells located next to periportal areas and those located far within the parenchyma. In contrast, CD44 staining was more intense in the parenchyma than in periportal areas, suggesting a role of CD44 in oval-cell invasion. Moreover, newly differentiated CK-19+ hepatocytes within foci did not show CD44 staining, suggesting that CD44 is related to the undifferentiated oval-cell phenotype. We then investigated oval-cell reactivity in CD44-deficient mice fed an oval cell-inducing diet of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine. Results showed significantly reduced oval-cell reactivity in CD44-deficient mice. Thus, oval cells express MMP-7 and CD44, and CD44 appears to play critical roles in the proliferation, invasion, and differentiation of hepatic oval cells in rodents.",M2
19702178,"Mitigation of carbon tetrachloride-induced damage by Phyllanthus amarus in liver of mice.Liver disease has become a global concern worldwide. In absence of reliable liver protective drugs in modem medicine, a large number of medicinal preparations are recommended for the treatment of liver disorders as they are believed to be harmless based on their natural origin. The aim of the present study was to determine the hepatoprotective activity of Phyllanthus amarus plant extract against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>-induced liver damage in female mice. Carbon tetrachloride administration caused a significant increase in liver and serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP), while total protein content significantly decreased as compared to vehicle control. The effect was dose-dependent. Oral administration of aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amarus along with carbon tetrachloride caused significant mitigation of CCl4-induced changes.",M2
19702175,"Antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Amorphophallus campanulatus Roxb. tubers.In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) tubers were evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) induced hepatic damage in rats. The extracts at a dose of 500 mg/kg were administered orally once daily. The substantially elevated serum enzymatic levels were significantly restored towards normalization by the extracts. Silymarin was used as a standard reference and exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced haptotoxicity in rats. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. The results of this study strongly indicate that Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) tubers have potent hepatoprotective action against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatic damage in rats. The ethanolic extract was found hepatoprotective more potent than the aqueous extract. The antioxidant activity was also screened and found positive for both ethanolic and aqueous extracts. This study suggests that possible mechanism of this activity may be due to free radical scavenging potential caused by the presence of flavonoids in the extracts.",M2
19662719,"Hepatoprotective property of Thespesia populnea against carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage in rats.The present study was carried out to evaluate the possible hepatoprotective activities of the medicinal plant Thespesia populnea in carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced liver injury in rats. The water suspension (500 mg/kg b.wt.) of leaf, flower and stem bark of T. populnea showed varying levels of protective action against CCl4-induced liver damage as evidenced from significant reduction in the activities of serum marker enzymes for liver damage (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase), and bilirubin levels when compared with CCl4-intoxicated control rats. The stem bark suspension showed maximum hepatoprotection compared with leaf and flower. An ethanol extract of the stem bark was more active than n-hexane and water extracts, showing remarkable protection at a dose of 60 mg/kg b.wt. The hepatoprotective effect of this extract was almost comparable to that of silymarin (100 mg/kg), a reference herbal drug. Thus, the present study indicates that ethanol extract of T. populnea stem bark is promising for further studies leading to hepatoprotective drug development.",M2
19659781,"Amelioration of hepatic fibrosis via Padma Hepaten is associated with altered natural killer T lymphocytes.Hepatic fibrosis is the end-stage consequence of chronic liver disease, affecting many people worldwide. Unlike the anti-fibrotic effect of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 and NK T subsets are considered as profibrogenic subsets. Padma Hepaten is a multi-compound herbal preparation derived from Tibetan medicine and has proven efficacy in some clinical trials and tests at the cellular level. In this study, we evaluate the immune efficacy of Padma Hepaten administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and/or orally in a mice model of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by 6 weeks of biweekly i.p. carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) injections in male C57Bl6 mice. There were four groups, including naive mice, non-treated fibrotic mice and fibrotic mice treated by Padma Hepaten at weeks 5-6 of fibrosis induction either orally or by i.p. injections. Padma Hepaten was prepared at 10 mg/ml in saline and 250 microl (2.5 mg) were administered four times per week. After week 6, animals were killed. To isolate a Padma Hepaten-associated effect on lymphocytes, splenocytes were harvested from either naive or Padma Hepaten-treated non-fibrotic donors. Isolated splenocytes were therefore reconstituted into two groups of irradiated recipients. Recipients were then administered the same CCl4 regimen. Hepatic fibrosis was determined by sirius red staining of liver sections and by assessment of alpha smooth muscle actin expression compared with beta-actin (both by mRNA as well as the protein liver extract western blotting). Hepatic fibrosis and alanine aminotransferase serum levels were decreased significantly in both Padma Hepaten-treated groups compared with the non-treated fibrotic group. Padma Hepaten treatment was associated with attenuation of lymphocyte subsets in both treated groups. Using a chemiluminescence technique to assess total anti-oxidant capacities (TAC), it was found that both the plasmas and livers of mice treated by CCl4 had significantly higher TAC compared with controls. However, the levels of TAC in animals treated either by CCl4 alone or CCl4 with Padma Hepaten were similar. Adoptive transfer of Padma Hepaten-treated lymphocytes was associated with fibrosis amelioration compared with recipients with naive lymphocytes. CCl4 generates higher levels of anti-oxidant capacities, probably as a response to oxidative stress. Padma Hepaten administration attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis significantly, accompanied by attenuation of lymphocyte but not anti-oxidant capacities.",M2
19646978,"(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced rat hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of the PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R.Hepatic fibrosis is a major complication of various chronic liver diseases. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis and the axis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is closely associated with the activation of HSC. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which also belongs to RTKs, interacts with the PDGF/PDGFR axis, thereby cooperatively promoting hepatic fibrosis. We herein examined the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which inhibits the activation of several types of RTKs, on the development of rat liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>). Drinking water with 0.1% EGCG significantly decreased the serum levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase raised by CCl4, thus indicating an improvement of liver injury. In CCl4-injected rats, EGCG markedly attenuated hepatic fibrosis and decreased the amount of hydroxyproline in the experimental liver. The expression of PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R mRNAs in the liver was significantly lowered by the treatment with EGCG. EGCG also decreased the expression of PDGFRbeta and alpha-smooth muscle actin proteins, thus indicating the inhibition of HSC activation. These findings suggest that EGCG can exert, at least in part, an anti-fibrotic effect on the liver by targeting PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R. EGCG might therefore be useful in both the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",M2
19634318,"Asiatic acid derivatives protect primary cultures of rat hepatocytes against carbon tetrachloride-induced injury via the cellular antioxidant system.We attempted to elucidate the hepatoprotective mechanism of two asiatic acid (AS) derivatives, 3beta,23-dihydroxyurs-2-oxo-12-ene-28-oic acid (AS-10) and 3beta,23-dihydroxyurs-12-ene-28-oic acid (AS-14), which exhibited significant protective activity against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced hepatotoxicity in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Our findings showed that AS-10 and AS-14 preserved the level of glutathione and the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, these compounds ameliorated lipid peroxidation, as demonstrated by a reduction in the production of malondialdehyde. Furthermore, AS-10 and AS-14 did not restore the reduced total GSH level by BSO, indicating that the hepatoprotective activities of these compounds may be involved, in part, by regulating GSH synthesis. From these results, we suggest that both AS-10 and AS-14 exerted their hepatoprotective activities against CCl4-induced injury by preserving the cellular antioxidative defense system.",M2
19595748,"Induction of CYP1A1, 2B, 2E1 and 3A in rat liver by organochlorine pesticide dicofol.The present study has determined the ability of dicofol, an organochlorine pesticide, to induce cytochrome P450 using rats treated with 1, 10, and 25mg/kg dicofol intraperitoneally for 4 days. Treatments with 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol produced dose-related increases of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b(5) contents and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, aniline hydroxylase, and erythromycin N-demethylase activities in liver microsomes. The treatments also increased glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activities in liver cytosol. Dicofol at 1mg/kg produced a general trend towards increases of the aforementioned enzyme levels. The results of immunoblot analyses showed that 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol increased protein levels of CYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2E1, and 3A in liver. RT-PCR data indicated that dicofol induced mRNA expression of liver CYP1A1, CYP2B, and CYP3A. Pretreatments of rats with 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol decreased phenobarbital-induced sleeping time by 34% and 39%, respectively. Dicofol pretreatment at 25mg/kg increased <e>CCl4</e>-induced serum alanine aminotransferase activity by 4.3-fold and aspartate aminotransferase activity by 4.1-fold. The present study demonstrates that dicofol has the ability to induce CYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2E1, and CYP3A in the liver and increase phenobarbital metabolism and CCl4 toxicity in rats.",M2
19569334,"Reduction of polychlorinated ethanes and carbon tetrachloride by structural Fe(II) in smectites.Ferrous iron associated with clay minerals can be important for the reductive transformation of organic contaminants in anoxic soils and groundwaters. We investigated the reactivity of structural Fe(II) in ferruginous smectite for the reduction of a series of polychlorinated alkanes (hexa-, penta-, 1,1,1,2-and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)) in laboratory batch reactors. Evaluation of reaction kinetics, product distribution, and C-isotope fractionation suggest that polychlorinated ethanes containing three alpha-Cl atoms reacted via reductive beta-elimination to the corresponding ethenes while CCl4-reduction leads predominantly to the formation of chloroform. Reduction kinetics followed a typical biphasic behavior characteristic of the presence of two types of Fe(II) species exhibiting different reactivity in the octahedral sheet of smectites, and reaction rate constants were pH-independent. Dehydrochlorination reactions of chloroethanes containing at least one beta-H atom were found to compete with or even dominate over the reduction reaction with increasing suspension pH. Reference experiments in homogeneous solution and with non-reduced smectite performed in the pH range of 5.5-8.5 suggest that the HCl-elimination is not catalyzed at mineral surfaces. From the observed slow transformation of chloroalkanes, we hypothesize that structural Fe(II) in smectites will be important mainly as a reductant in the subsurface once iron(hydr)oxides have been reductively dissolved.",M2
19567170,"Effect of oxymatrine on the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases signalling pathway in rats with <e>CCl4</e> induced hepatic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway plays an important role in hepatic fibrosis. This study explored the antifibrotic effect of oxymatrine on tetrachloromethane induced liver fibrosis in rats and its modulation on the p38 MAPK signalling pathway. METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups: normal (n = 20), induced fibrosis (n = 20), colchicine (n = 20) and three treatment groups of oxymatrine (n = 20 x 3). We obesrved changes in deposition of collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen type IV (CIV), procollagen III (PCIII) and hydroxyproline (Hyp), a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and phosphor-p38 (pp38). RESULTS: The relative indicators of changes in histopathology, HA, LN, CIV, PCIII, Hyp, alpha-SMA and pp38 were raised significantly in the induced fibrosis group (P &lt; 0.01 vs normal group). The semiquantitative hepatic fibrosis staging scores of middle dose group and high dose group were decreased (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01 respectively vs the induced fibrosis group), as was the average area of collagen in rats' liver, the concentrations of serum HA, LN, CIV, PCIII and liver tissue homogenate Hyp. The gene expression of alpha-SMA mRNA was considerably decreased in the treated animals, as was the protein espression of pp38 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Oxymatrine is effective in reducing the production and deposition of collagen in the liver tissue of experimental rats in ways which relate to modulating the fibrogenic signal transduction via p38 MAPK signalling pathway.",M2
19548444,"[Syndrome identification of <e>CCl4</e> induced liver fibrosis model rats based on syndrome detecting from recipe used]OBJECTIVE: To further demonstrate the cognition upon the prominent effect of Yiguanjian and Xiayuxue Decoction on the CCI4 induced rat model of chronic liver fibrosis which have been verified in the previous studies. From the viewpoint of detecting TCM syndrome by recipe used, through this cognition the pathological features of the liver injury model manifesting a syndrome of  Gan-yin deficiency with blood stasis obstructing collaterals  were further explored. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group, and the three medicated groups. All rats, except those in the normal group, were made into chronic liver injury model by subcutaneously injecting CCI4 for 12 weeks. Medication for the three medicated groups began from the 9th week after modeling, with oral administering of Yiguanjian (YGJ, a recipe has been verified to be effective for liver injury and fibrosis), Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (LWDH, a recipe with effects similar to YGJ) and Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD, a recipe functioned differently) respectively for four weeks. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, changes of hepatic function, liver pathology and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the liver tissue were detected, and contents of Afamin and mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in the liver tissue were assayed as well with Real-time PCR. RESULTS: As compared with the normal group, the pathological figures of the chronic liver injury and fibrosis and hepatic function deterioration obviously appeared in the model rats, with the liver content of Hyp and alpha-SMA mRNA expression increased, and Afamin mRNA expression decreased significantly. In the YGJ treated group, the hepatic collagen hyperplasia and deteriorated hepatic function alleviated significantly after treatment, with content of Hyp significantly lowered, and mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin restored to some extent (P &lt; 0.05); the same effects on mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin were shown in the LWDH treated group, also a decreasing trend of Hyp content (0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1), and a significant decreasing of alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was found; while in the YCHD treated group these pharmacological effects mentioned above were not observed at all. CONCLUSION: The pharmacological effects of LWDH and YGJ were similar to some degree, which gives support to the cognition that the feature of chronic liver injury model rat induced by CCI4 is attributable to yin-deficiency sydrome.",M2
19536921,"Hepatoprotective effects of Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract on carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver hepatotoxicity in rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Coptidis rhizoma (CR, Chinese name is Huanglian) has been used in treating infectious and inflammatory diseases for two thousand years in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Its related pharmacological basis for the therapeutics has been studied intensively, but CR can also be used for vomiting of  dampness-heat type or acid regurgitation  due to  liver-fire attacking stomach  in TCM, whose symptoms seem to link the hepatic and biliary disorders, yet details in the therapies of liver diseases and underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. To clarify this ethnopharmacological relevance, hepatoprotective effect of Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract (CRAE) and its possible mechanism were studied in rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPRAGUE-Dawley (SD) rats aged 7 weeks old were intraperitoneally injected with CCl4 at a dose of 1.0 ml/kg as a 50% olive oil solution. The rats were orally given the CRAE at doses of 400, 600, 800 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg berberine body weight (BW) after 6 h of CCl4 treatment. At 24 h after CCl4 injection, samples of blood and liver were collected and then biochemical parameters and histological studies were carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that CRAE and berberine inhibited significantly the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Observation on the hepatoprotective effect of berberine was consistent to that of CRAE. CONCLUSION: The study is the first time to demonstrate that CRAE has hepatoprotective effect on acute liver injuries induced by CCl4, and the results suggest that the effect of CRAE against CCl4-induced liver damage is related to antioxidant property.",M2
19527736,"Deleterious effects of silymarin on the expression of genes controlling endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in carbon tetrachloride-treated rat livers.AIMS: Defects in intrahepatic nitric oxide (NO) are attributed to reduced blood flow due to portal hypertension caused by diminished endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. The aim of this study is to identify the therapeutic effects of silymarin on eNOS/NO-related enzymes and hepatic enzymes in carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced cirrhotic rats. MAIN METHODS: CCl4 treated for 12 weeks was discontinued and then administrated with silymarin daily for 4 weeks. Collagen concentrations were determined by measuring hydroxyproline content. Serum was assayed for hepatic enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. NOS activities were measured by oxyhemoglobin oxidation assay, and levels of enzyme expression and phosphorylation were detected by Western-blot analyses. KEY FINDINGS: Silymarin treatment restored the values for collagen content and ALT and ALP activities when compared to the values with spontaneous resolution following discontinuation of CCl4. CCl4 treatment highly increased eNOS expression and NOS activity in livers, but the phosphorylation was markedly decreased. Silymarin decreased significantly eNOS expression and activity. Expression and/or phosphorylation of enzymes activating eNOS were unchanged (Akt and AMPK) or decreased (PKA) by silymarin. Especially, the expression of caveolin-1, an inhibitor of eNOS was unchanged by CCl4, but its phosphorylation was significantly increased. However, silymarin markedly increased caveolin-1 expression but decreased its phosphorylation to expression. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that chronic silymarin treatment can improve cirrhosis-induced liver enzyme activities and fibrosis, but may aggravate the hemodynamic eNOS activity, particularly by decreasing eNOS expression and increasing caveolin-1 expression.",M2
19502658,"Pharmacokinetics of acemetacin and its active metabolite indomethacin in rats during acute hepatic damage and liver regeneration.BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pharmacokinetics of acemetacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is biotransformed to indomethacin by hepatic first-pass effect, was examined during the necrotic and regeneration phases resulting from acute hepatitis induced by carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Acute hepatitis was induced by oral CCl4 administration to male Wistar rats. On days 0, 1 and 3 after the insult, liver histological analysis was performed, biochemical markers of liver damage and regeneration were measured, and the pharmacokinetics of oral acemetacin and of its active metabolite, indomethacin, were determined. RESULTS: One day after CCl4 administration, liver necrosis was apparent and there was an increase in the circulating levels of indicators of liver damage and regeneration with regard to control conditions. Acemetacin bioavailability was increased, although not in a statistically significant manner. On the other hand, indomethacin bioavailability was significantly reduced. By day 3, histological analysis revealed liver recovery, although not complete, while biochemical indicators of hepatic damage had reverted either totally or partially. Markers of liver regeneration were still increased. Bioavailability acemetacin and indomethacin was comparable to control values. IN CONCLUSION: Indomethacin bioavailability after oral administration of its precursor, acemetacin, is significantly reduced by acute hepatitis produced by CCl4. Pharmacokinetic alterations, as liver damage, are reversible, but do not require complete liver regeneration to return to basal conditions.",M2
19501992,"Therapeutic efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine 319 recipe on hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic fibrosis is a consequence of severe liver damage that occurs in many patients with chronic liver diseases. TCM 319 recipe is a Chinese Medicine formula which consists of six Chinese herbs. In this study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic efficacy and mechanisms of TCM 319 recipe. METHODS: Hepatic fibrosis in rats was induced by carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>). 34 male adult SD rats were allocated into five groups (group 1-concomitant CCl4 and TCM 319 recipe for 8 weeks; group 2-CCl4 for 4 weeks and then CCl4 and TCM 319 recipe for 4 weeks; group 3-CCl4 alone for 8 weeks; group 4-TCM 319 recipe only for 8 weeks; group 5-untreated controls). After 8 weeks of treatment, serum ALT assay, liver tissue histological examination and immunostaining were carried out to examine the liver function and fibrosis degree. The expression levels of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B), PDGF-Rbeta, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: TCM 319 recipe reduced liver injury and attenuated hepatic fibrosis in group 1 compared with that in group 3. TCM 319 recipe suppressed the mRNA expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). In addition, treatment with TCM 319 recipe significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta, and it also suppressed protein expression of PDGF-Rbeta and TGF-beta1. CONCLUSIONS: TCM 319 recipe extracts could attenuate hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 in rats. The anti-fibrotic effect of TCM 319 recipe is associated with the down-regulation of mRNA expression of TIMP-1, PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta, and with the suppression of protein expression of PDGF-Rbeta and TGF-beta1.",M2
19488034,"Loss of steroid receptor co-activator-3 attenuates carbon tetrachloride-induced murine hepatic injury and fibrosis.Hepatic fibrosis, a disease characterized by altered accumulation of extracellular matrix, can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. There is growing interest in the impact of co-activators on hepatic fibrogenesis. Here, we provided genetic evidence that mice lacking steroid receptor co-activator-3 (SRC-3) were protected against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced acute liver necrosis and chronic hepatic fibrosis. After acute CCl4 treatment, SRC-3(-/-) mice showed attenuated profibrotic response and hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas hepatocyte proliferation was elevated in SRC-3(-/-) mice versus SRC-3+/+ mice. Similarly, chronically CCl4-treated SRC-3(-/-) mice showed significant weakening of inflammatory infiltrates, hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen accumulation in the liver compared with SRC-3+/+ mice. Further investigation revealed that TGFbeta1/Smad signaling pathway was impaired in the absence of SRC-3. Moreover, the expression levels of SRC-3, as assessed in human tissue microarray of liver diseases, correlated positively with degrees of fibrosis. These data revealed that SRC-3(-/-) mice were resistant to CCl4-induced acute and chronic hepatic damage and TGFbeta1/Smad signaling was suppressed in the lack of SRC-3. Our results established an essential involvement of SRC-3 in liver fibrogenesis, which might provide new clues to the future treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",M2
19452445,"Involvement of IQGAP3, a regulator of Ras/ERK-related cascade, in hepatocyte proliferation in mouse liver regeneration and development.The spatio-temporal regulation of hepatocyte proliferation is a critical issue in liver regeneration. Here, in normal and regenerating liver as well as in developing liver, we examined its expression/localization of IQGAP3, which was most recently reported as a Ras/Rac/Cdc42-binding proliferation factor associated with cell-cell contacts in epithelial-type cells. In parallel, the expression/localization of Rac/Cdc42-binding IQGAP1/2 was examined. IQGAP3 showed a specific expression in proliferating hepatocytes positive for the proliferating marker Ki-67, the levels of expressions of mRNAs and proteins were significantly increased in hepatocytes in liver regeneration and development. In immunofluorescence, IQGAP3 was highly enriched at cell-cell contacts of hepatocytes. IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 were exclusively expressed in Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells, respectively, in normal, regenerating, and developing liver. The expression of IQGAP1, but not of IQGAP2, was increased in <e>CCl4</e>-induced (but not in partial hepatectomy-induced) liver regeneration. Exclusive expression/localization of IQGAP3 to hepatocytes in the liver likely reflects the specific involvement of the IQGAP3/Ras/ERK signaling cascade in hepatocyte proliferation in addition to the previously identified signaling pathways, possibly by integrating cell-cell contact-related proliferating signaling events. On the other hand, the Rac/Cdc42-binding properties of IQGAP1/2/3 may be related to the distinct modes of remodeling due to the different strategies which induced proliferation of liver cells; partial hepatectomy, CCl4 injury, or embryonic development. Thus, the functional orchestration of Ras and the Ras homologous (Rho) family proteins Rac/Cdc42 likely plays a critical role in liver regeneration and development.",M2
19424597,"Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in <e>CCL4</e>-induced rat liver fibrosis.The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in liver fibrosis. A novel homologue of angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE2, was identified as a negative regulator of RAS as it degrades Ang II to Ang1-7. We investigated in vivo the expression of ACE2 in liver fibrosis. We evaluated the relationship between biochemical variables and liver tissue expression of ACE2, the correlation between a histological assessment of liver fibrosis and liver tissue expression of ACE2. Male SD rats were randomly divided into a CCL4 group which received injections of CCL4 and the control group which received injections of olive oil. Liver pathology was examined by H&amp;E and Sirius red staining, and real-time PCR was performed to determine the gene expression levels of ACE2 and ACE. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that ACE2 mRNA was higher at the two-, four-, and six-week time points, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Similarly, hepatic ACE mRNA was significantly increased after CCL4 injection. There was a significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 gene expression (r=0.750, P&lt;0.001). ACE2 gene expression strongly correlated with ALT (r=0.669, P&lt;0.0001) and AST levels (r=0.815, P&lt;0.0001). There was a significant correlation between circulating ACE2 and histological scores of liver fibrosis. ACE2 and ACE gene expression correlated with the ISHAK score (r=0.850, P&lt;0.001; r=0.806, P&lt;0.001). There was a significant relationship between ACE2 gene expression and the degree of liver fibrosis. ACE2 plays a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis.",M2
19422480,"Effect of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a cirrhotic rat model.BACKGROUND/AIM: Cirrhosis is a long-term consequence of chronic hepatic injury and no effective therapy is currently available for this disease. Recent reports have shown that the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to differentiate into hepatocytes, and umbilical cord blood is a rich source of MSCs. Hence, we investigated the effect of infusing of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (HMSCs) in carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced cirrhosis in a rat model. METHODS: The effect of HMSCs on cirrhosis was evaluated using haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. To evaluate cirrhosis-related factors, we measured protein and mRNA expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), collagen type I and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). RESULTS: Histological findings showed that liver fibrosis in rats was alleviated by HMSCs infusion. Interestingly, CM-DiI-labelled HMSCs expressed the hepatocyte-specific markers, human albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. Infusion of HMSCs significantly inhibited TGF-beta1, collagen type I and alpha-SMA expressions in CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that HMSCs infusion could improve liver fibrosis in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis, raising the possibility for clinical use of HMSCs in the treatment of cirrhosis.",M2
19420997,"Hepatoprotective and curative properties of Kombucha tea against carbon tetrachloride-induced toxicity.Kombucha tea (KT) is sugared black tea fermented with a symbiotic culture of acetic acid bacteria and yeasts, which is said to be tea fungus. KT is claimed to have various beneficial effects on human health, but there is very little scientific evidence available in the literature. In the present study, KT along with black tea (BT) and black tea manufactured with tea fungus enzymes (enzyme-processed tea, ET) was evaluated for hepatoprotective and curative properties against <e>CCl4</e>-induced toxicity, using male albino rats as an experimental model by analyzing aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase in plasma and malondialdehyde content in plasma and liver tissues. Histopathological analysis of liver tissue was also included. Results showed that BT, ET, and KT have the potential to revert the CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. Among the three types of teas tried, KT was found to be more efficient than BT and ET. Antioxidant molecules produced during the fermentation period could be the reason for the efficient hepatoprotective and curative properties of KT against CCI4-induced hepatotoxicity.",M2
19405380,"Hepato and reno protective action of Calendula officinalis L. flower extract.Flower extract of C. officinalis L. was evaluated for its protective effect against <e>CCl4</e> induced acute hepatotoxicity and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. The activities of serum marker enzymes of liver injury like glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which were increased by CCl4 injection was found to be significantly reduced by the pretreatment of the flower extract at 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight. The lipid peroxidation in liver, the marker of membrane damage and the total bilirubin content in serum were also found to be at significantly low level in the extract pretreated group, indicating its protective role. The kidney function markers like urea and creatinine were significantly increased in cisplatin treated animals. However, their levels were found to be lowered in the extract pretreated groups (100 and 250 mg/kg body weight). Moreover, cisplatin induced myelosuppression was ameliorated by the extract pretreatment. Treatment with the extract produced enhancement of antioxidant enzymes--superoxide dismutase and catalase and glutathione. Results suggest a protective role of the flower extract of C. officinalis against CCl4 induced acute hepatotoxicity and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. Extract has been found to contain several carotenoids of which lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene predominates. Possible mechanism of action of the flower extract may be due to its antioxidant activity and reduction of oxygen radicals.",M2
19399744,"The therapeutic potential of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton's jelly in the treatment of rat liver fibrosis.We investigated the effect of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) from Wharton's jelly on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Rats were treated with CCl4 for 4 weeks, and this was followed by a direct injection of HUMSCs into their livers. After 4 more weeks of CCl4 treatment (8 weeks in all), rats with HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC liver] exhibited a significant reduction in liver fibrosis, as evidenced by Sirius red staining and a collagen content assay, in comparison with rats treated with CCl4 for 8 weeks without HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)]. Moreover, rats in the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group had significantly lower levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvate transaminase, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-beta1 in the liver, whereas the expression of hepatic mesenchymal epithelial transition factor-phosphorylated type (Met-P) and hepatocyte growth factor was up-regulated, in comparison with the CCl4 (8W) group. Notably, engrafted HUMSCs scattered mostly in the hepatic connective tissue but did not differentiate into hepatocytes expressing human albumin or alpha-fetoprotein. Instead, these engrafted, undifferentiated HUMSCs secreted a variety of bioactive cytokines that may restore liver function and promote regeneration. Human cytokine assay revealed that the amounts of human cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, and prolactin were substantially greater in the livers of the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group, with considerably reduced hepatic inflammation manifested by a micro positron emission tomography scan. Our findings suggest that xenogeneic transplantation of HUMSCs is a novel approach for treating liver fibrosis and may be a promising therapeutic intervention in the future.",M2
19394401,"Neutral sphingomyelinase-induced ceramide accumulation by oxidative stress during carbon tetrachloride intoxication.Ceramide is a biologically active lipid causing apoptosis in a variety of cells. In this study, we examined the effect of <e>CCl4</e> on the ceramide metabolism and indicators of oxidative stress. After 12 h of oral administration of CCl4 (4 ml/kg body weight as a 1:1 mixture of CCl4 and mineral oil) to rats, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were increased. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E were decreased in the liver and kidney. In addition, the ratio of GSH/GSSG in the liver, plasma, kidney, and brain decreased at 2h. The total ceramide in the liver significantly increased as early as 2h after CCl4 administration. After 24 and 36 h, the total ceramide in plasma and the kidney was also augmented. In the brain, the total ceramide dramatically increased at 36 h. These results suggested that the increased ceramide in plasma was transferred to the kidney and the brain. The activity of neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase), which was reported to be enhanced by the decrease of GSH, was significantly increased after CCl4 treatment in the liver, kidney, and brain. However, acid SMase activities were not increased in the liver and kidney. Thus, the activation of neutral SMase via oxidative stress induced the increase of ceramide during CCl4 intoxication in not only the liver but also other tissues. These results suggested that the excess accumulation of ceramide causes damage in other organs including the kidney and brain during fulminant hepatic failure.",M2
19386599,"A novel function of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor during rat liver regeneration and in growth-promoted hepatocytes in primary culture.Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) exhibits anti-fibrinolytic activity by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin or plasminogen receptor proteins on the cellular surface, and plays an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis. In this study, we examined the regulation of TAFI in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, and revealed its pivotal role in hepatocyte proliferation. In rat models, partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced acute liver injury suppressed the levels of plasma TAFI activity and hepatic TAFI mRNA, whereas this operation markedly increased both the hepatic plasmin activity and the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, the TAFI mRNA level was decreased under growth-promoting culture conditions. Treatment of the hepatocytes with TAFI siRNA increased the amount of plasmin on the hepatocytes and promoted hepatocyte proliferation. We concluded that TAFI regulates plasmin activity through its enzymatic activity whereby it reduces the plasminogen-binding capacity of the hepatocytes. The TAFI gene expression is down-regulated in hepatocyte proliferation for producing a fibrinolytic microenvironment suitable for cell growth. This is the first report on the role of TAFI in the pericellular fibrinolysis necessary for cellular proliferation.",M2
19382721,"Hepatoprotective activity of six polyherbal formulations in <e>CCl4</e>-induced liver toxicity in mice.To evaluate pretreatment of six polyherbal liquid formulations (PLFs) commercially available in India, on CCl4-induced liver injury, Swiss albino mice were treated for 7 days with distilled water or PLFs (2.6 and 5.2 ml/kg body weight/day, po) followed by single sc injection of 50% (v/v) CCl4 in arachis oil at a dose of 1 ml/kg. The serum biochemical parameters such as alanine transaminases, aspartate transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were estimated. Phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time and liver histopathology were also carried out. CCl4-treated animals showed significant increase in the levels of liver enzymes, phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time and revealed fatty changes and centrizonal necrosis on histological examination of liver indicating hepatic damage. When pretreated with PLFs at a dose of 5.2 ml/kg body weight/day, the CCl4-induced changes were significantly reversed. The pretreatment with PLFs can prevent acute liver damage induced by CCl4 only at a higher dose. Therefore, it is suggested that a dose adjustment of these PLFs may be necessary for their optimal effects in human liver diseases.",M2
19352025,"Protective effect of iridoid glucosides from Boschniakia rossica on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.The protective effect of iridoid glucosides from Boschniakia rossica (BRI) against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced liver injury was examined. CCl4 at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg of body weight was given intraperitoneally to rats to induce liver damage. The rats were sacrificed 16 h after the CCl4 injection. The CCl4 challenge caused a marked increase in the levels of serum animotransferases, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and of hepatic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein, depleted reduced glutathione (GSH), and propagated lipid peroxidation. The liver antioxidative defense system, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression were suppressed, however. Preadministration of BRI reversed the significant changes of all liver function parameters induced by CCl4 and restored the liver CYP2E1 content and function. These results demonstrate that BRI produced a protective action on CCl4-induced acute hepatic injury via reduced oxidative stress, suppressed inflammatory response and improved CYP2E1 function in the liver.",M2
19345057,"Protective effects of transgene expressed human PON3 against <e>CCl4</e>-induced subacute liver injury in mice.Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in both initiation and progression of liver injury in almost all experimental and clinical liver diseases. Antioxidative therapy is therefore an effective means of preventing and attenuating oxidative stress related liver diseases. Human paraoxonase 3 (hPON3) is a lipid-associated enzyme with antioxidant activity. In the present study, hPON3 cDNA gene was cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid and electro-transferred into mouse skeletal muscle to maintain a higher serum PON3 activity. After gene delivery, serum PON3 activity was about 1.4 times higher than those of control and PON3 mRNA expression was also detected in mouse skeletal muscle. To investigate the role of hPON3 in protecting mice against liver injury, subacute liver injury model was induced by repeated CCl(4) administration and hPON3 gene was delivered into mouse skeletal muscle before progression or recovery phase, respectively, of liver injury. Afterwards, the mice were euthanized to evaluate liver marker enzymes, degrees of oxidative stress and liver histological architecture in order to reveal the effects of PON3 on subacute liver injury. In both damage phases, delivery of hPON3 gene significantly reduced serum aminotransferase level and improved liver histological architecture. Moreover, transgene expression of hPON3 attenuated oxidative stress by increasing hepatic glutathione content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) level.",M2
19336974,"Carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in pregnant and lactating rats.Carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) is well known to induce hepatotoxicity after being metabolized to trichloromethyl free radical ((.)CCl3) by CYP2E1. In the present study, the hepatotoxicity induced by a single oral dose (2,000 mg/kg) of CCl4 was compared between pregnant (gestation days (GD) 13 and 19) or postpartum (postpartum days (PPD) 1, 13 and 27) and non-pregnant rats. Hepatotoxicity in CCl4-treated pregnant rats evaluated by blood chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities) and histopathological finding (area of damaged hepatocytes) was minimal on GD19, being weaker than that in non-pregnant rats. CYP2E1 expression in non-treated pregnant rats decreased as pregnancy progressed and reached minimum level on GD19. Thus, the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity roughly corresponded to CYP2E1 levels during pregnancy. After delivery, hepatotoxicity in CCl4-treated lactating rats was maximal on PPD13, being stronger than that in non-pregnant rats, and then it decreased slightly on PPD27. The CYP2E1 level in the non-treated lactating rats tended to increase but remained at lower levels until PPD13 compared with that in non-pregnant rats. Thus, the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity did not correspond to CYP2E1 levels during lactation. This suggests that during lactation, there may be certain factors other than CYP2E1 expression responsible for the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity.",M2
19322917,"Melatonin ameliorates experimental hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.AIM: To investigate the protective effects of melatonin on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in experimental rats. METHODS: All rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group treated with CCl4 for 12 wk, CCl4 + NAC group treated with CCl4 + NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 12 wk, CCl4 + MEL-1 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (2.5 mg/kg) for 12 wk, CCl4 + MEL-2 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (5.0 mg/kg) for 12 wk, and CCl4 + MEL-3 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (10 mg/kg). Rats in the treatment groups were injected subcutaneously with sterile CCl4 (3 mL/kg, body weight) in a ratio of 2:3 with olive oil twice a week. Rats in normal control group received hypodermic injection of olive oil at the same dose and frequency as those in treatment groups. At the end of experiment, rats in each group were anesthetized and sacrificed. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Van Gieson staining were used to examine changes in liver pathology. Serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and protein concentration were measured with routine laboratory methods using an autoanalyzer. Hydroxyproline (HYP) content in liver and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels in liver homogenates were assayed by spectrophotometry. Serum hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), and procollagen III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP) were determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Pathologic grading showed that the fibrogenesis was much less severe in CCl4 + MEL3 group than in model control group (u = 2.172, P &lt; 0.05), indicating that melatonin (10 mg/kg) can significantly ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic fibrotic changes. The serum levels of ALT and AST were markedly lower in CCl4 + MEL treatment groups (5, 10 mg/kg) than in model control group (ALT: 286.23 +/- 121.91 U/L vs 201.15 +/- 101.16 U/L and 178.67 +/- 103.14 U/L, P = 0.028, P = 0.007; AST: 431.00 +/- 166.35 U/L vs 321.23 +/- 162.48 U/L and 292.42 +/- 126.23 U/L, P = 0.043, P = 0.013). Similarly, the serum laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels and hydroxyproline (HYP) contents in liver were significantly lower in CCl4 + MEL-3 group (10 mg/kg) than in model control group (LN: 45.89 +/- 11.71 microg/L vs 55.26 +/- 12.30 microg/L, P = 0.012; HA: 135.71 +/- 76.03 microg/L vs 201.10 +/- 68.46 microg/L, P = 0.020; HYP: 0.42 +/- 0.08 mg/g tissue vs 0.51 +/- 0.07 mg/g tissue, P = 0.012). Moreover, treatment with melatonin (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the MDA content and increased the GPx activity in liver homogenates compared with model control group (MDA: 7.89 +/- 1.49 noml/mg prot vs 6.29 +/- 1.42 noml/mg prot and 6.25 +/- 2.27 noml/mg prot, respectively, P = 0.015, P = 0.015; GPx: 49.13 +/- 8.72 U/mg prot vs 57.38 +/- 7.65 U/mg prot and 61.39 +/- 13.15 U/mg prot, respectively, P = 0.035, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Melatonin can ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. The protective effect of melatonin on hepatic fibrosis may be related to its antioxidant activities.",M2
19256381,"[Catalytic reduction of <e>CCl4</e> in water by Fe0 and amended Fe0]Various bimetallic reductants of Cu/Fe, Ag/Fe, Pd/Fe and Ni/Fe were prepared by plating Cu, Ag, Pd and Ni on the surface of Fe0. Reductive dechlorination of toxic pollutants of CCl4 in water with Fe0 and amended Fe0 by batch experiments was investigated. Results show that CCl4 in water can be rapidly dechlorinated by above five catalytic reductants, and the presence of Cu, Ag, Pd can enhance the dechlorination rate dramatically. The reaction of CCl4 with various reductants was followed the pseudo first order kinetics, and the dechlorination rate constant of CCl4 in water by Fe0, Cu/Fe, Ag/Fe, Pd/Fe and Ni/Fe was 0.0393, 0.0925, 0.158, 0.0496 and 0.0533 min(-1) respectively. The byproducts and pathway of dechlorination of CCl4 by Fe0 and amended Fe0 was identified by GC/MS. Results indicate that the products and dechlorination rate of CCl4 by various bimetallic reductants are varied. The main products are chloroform and dichloromethane in Cu/Fe and Ag/Fe system, and that is methane in Pd/Fe system. Hydrogenolysis is the dominant reaction pathway of CCl4 by Fe0 and amended Fe0.",M2
19250650,"Reactive nitrogen species switch on early extracellular matrix remodeling via induction of MMP1 and TNFalpha.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Liver injury leads to generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which can react to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO-). We investigated whether ONOO- and its metabolites modulate extracellular matrix remodeling. METHODS: Stellate cells (HSC) were incubated with pure ONOO- or SIN-1 (a ONOO- donor). Western blot, nuclear in vitro transcription, Northern blot, qPCR, and promoter transactivation analysis for COL1A1 and COL1A2 were carried out. Rats were fed alcohol or injected with <e>CCl4</e> to cause alcohol-induced liver injury and an early fibrogenic response. RESULTS: HSC incubated with ONOO- or SIN-1 showed similar viability, proliferation, COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcription rates, and mRNA levels as controls. There was a time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of collagen I and alpha-Sma proteins and up-regulation of MMP1 and TNFalpha, indicating decreased HSC activation. These effects were blocked by ONOO- scavengers. SIN-1 or ONOO- increased nitrosylation of MMP1/MMP13 and transactivation of the MMP1, MMP13, and TNFalpha promoters. A TNFalpha neutralizing antibody or GSH-ethyl ester blocked MMP1 promoter transactivation; whereas TNFalpha or l-buthionine sulfoximine, which depletes GSH, further enhanced it. Pretreatment with SIN-1 or ONOO- reduced the TGFbeta pro-fibrogenic response in HSC. In vivo experiments validated the protective role of ONOO- on the early fibrogenic response. However, highly activated HSC, such as myofibroblasts and HSC from chronic alcohol-fed rats, were resistant to the anti-fibrogenic actions of ONOO- due to higher levels of GSH, a ONOO- scavenger, overproduction of pro-fibrogenic TGFbeta, and reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: ONOO- could induce a protective mechanism in HSC in early stages of liver injury.",M2
19242656,"The preventive effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase on carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis in mice.In this study, the effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase conjugate (heparin-SOD) on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis were evaluated. To investigate the effects of heparin-SOD on acute liver failure, heparin-SOD was administered to CCl4-treated mice by intravenous injection. Biochemical indicators, such as glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GOT/GPT), GSH (glutathione), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined 24 h after CCl4 treatment. The development of CCl4-induced acute liver failure altered the redox state with a decreased hepatic GSH and increased formation of lipid peroxidative products, which were partially normalized by treatment with heparin-SOD or heparin + SOD. Compared with other groups, the acute liver injury of heparin-SOD group was significantly lessened (reduced activities of GOT/GPT, MDA, and increased activities of GSH). To investigate the effects of heparin-SOD on hepatic fibrosis, heparin-SOD and CCl4 were co-administered by intraperitoneal injection twice a week for 12 weeks. Histological and hepatic hydroxyproline examination revealed that heparin-SOD could significantly prevent the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, real-time PCR was used to determine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), fibronectin, and collagen-I expression. Significantly, greater fibrosis and TGF-beta1, MMP-2, fibronectin, and collagen-I expression were found in the liver of CCl4-induced mice at the end of 12th week. Heparin-SOD could markedly attenuate the mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, and collagen-I. Western blots of tissue homogenates revealed that the protein expression of TGF-beta1 was substantially reduce also by heparin-SOD treatment. These results demonstrate that administration of heparin-SOD may be useful in the treatment and prevention of acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis.",M2
19230414,"[Prevention and treatment of experimental liver fibrosis in rats by Semen Hoveniae extracts]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevention and treatment of experimental liver fibrosis in rats by Semen Hoveniae extracts (SHE). METHODS: Rats liver fiborsis model was induced by carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>). SD rats were randomly divided into six groups: the normal control group, the model control group, the positive control group and the SHE groups. The level of serum procollgan type-III (PC-III), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN) and liver function were measured, respectively. Liver histological examination was made. RESULTS: SHE could ameliorate CCl4-induced liver fibrosis significantly. The lever of serum PC-III, HA, LN decreased and liver function was improved. The histological examination also demonstrated its anti-fibrotic effect. CONCLUSION: SHE have anti-fibrotic effect on liver in vivo, and may have potential value for clinical use.",M2
19152825,"Methoxy VO-salen complex: in vitro antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity evaluation and protective effect on <e>CCl4</e>-induced oxidative stress in rats.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in normal physiological processes. However, the overproduction of ROS is involved in the onset of many degenerative diseases. Regarding this fact, discovery of new antioxidants is interesting for many research groups. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant properties of a methoxy VO-salen (MetVO-salen) complex employing various in vitro systems. In addition, the cytotoxic effect of MetVO-salen was assessed based on MTT in treated K562 cells. In an in vivo approach, the protective effect of MetVO-salen against CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress in rats was also investigated in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, as well as in terms of the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH). Our results indicated that MetVO-salen has an effective capability in scavenging superoxide (O*2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) radicals in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo results also showed that the administration of MetVO-salen to the CCl(4)-treated rats caused a significant (222%) increase in SOD activity, a 59% enhancement in GSH content and a 31% decrease in the level of MDA compared to the CCl(4)-treated control rats. Overall, MetVO-salen appears to be an effective antioxidant and is quite suitable for further biological evaluation.",M2
19145348,"Hepatoprotective properties of fractions from meadowsweet extract during experimental toxic hepatitis.Fractions of the extract from meadowsweet aerial parts in 70% ethanol exhibited hepatoprotective properties during <e>CCl4</e>-induced toxic hepatitis. This extract produced a normalizing effect on activity of enzymes, markers of cytolysis, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant defense system in liver cells. Fractionation of the extract was accompanied by dissociation of the effect. These changes reflect specific action of a complex of bioactive substances. The ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions from this extract were most potent. The effectiveness of these fractions by several parameters surpassed that of Carsil.",M2
19144177,"Paraoxonase-1 is related to inflammation, fibrosis and PPAR delta in experimental liver disease.BACKGROUND: Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an antioxidant enzyme synthesized by the liver. It protects against liver impairment and attenuates the production of the pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). We investigated the relationships between hepatic PON1 and MCP-1 expression in rats with liver disease and explored the possible molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: <e>CCl4</e> was administered for up to 12 weeks to induce liver damage. Serum and hepatic levels of PON1 and MCP-1, their gene and protein expression, nuclear transcription factors, and histological and biochemical markers of liver impairment were measured. RESULTS: High levels of PON1 and MCP-1 expression were observed at 12th week in the hepatocytes surrounding the fibrous septa and inflammatory areas. CCl4-administered rats had an increased hepatic PON1 concentration that was related to decreased gene transcription and inhibited protein degradation. Decreased PON1 gene transcription was associated with PPARdelta expression. These changes were accompanied by increased hepatic MCP-1 concentration and gene expression. There were significant direct relationships between hepatic PON1 and MCP-1 concentrations (P = 0.005) and between PON1 and the amount of activated stellate cells (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results from this experimental model suggest a hepato-protective role for PON1 against inflammation, fibrosis and liver disease mediated by MCP-1.",M2
19136384,"Increased susceptibility to exacerbated liver injury in hypercholesterolemic ApoE-deficient mice: potential involvement of oxysterols.The contribution of metabolic factors to the severity of liver disease is not completely understood. In this study, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice were evaluated to define potential effects of hypercholesterolemia on the severity of carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced liver injury. Under baseline conditions, hypercholesterolemic ApoE-/- mice showed increased hepatic oxidative stress (SOD activity/4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunostaining) and higher hepatic TGF-beta1, MCP-1, and TIMP-1 expression than wild-type control mice. After CCl4 challenge, ApoE-/- mice exhibited exacerbated steatosis (Oil Red O staining), necroinflammation (hematoxylin-eosin staining), macrophage infiltration (F4/80 immunohistochemistry), and fibrosis (Sirius red staining and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry) and more severe liver injury [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase] than wild-type controls. Direct correlations were identified between serum cholesterol and hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and ALT levels. These changes did not reflect the usual progression of the disease in ApoE-/- mice, since exacerbated liver injury was not present in untreated age-paired ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, hepatic cytochrome P-450 expression was unchanged in ApoE-/- mice. To explore potential mechanisms, cell types relevant to liver pathophysiology were exposed to selected cholesterol-oxidized products. Incubation of hepatocytes with a mixture of oxysterols representative of those detected by GC-MS in livers from ApoE-/- mice resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in total lipoperoxides and SOD activity. In hepatic stellate cells, oxysterols increased IL-8 secretion through a NF-kappaB-independent mechanism and upregulated TIMP-1 expression. In macrophages, oxysterols increased TGF-beta1 secretion and MCP-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Oxysterols did not compromise cell viability. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that hypercholesterolemic mice are sensitized to liver injury and that cholesterol-derived products (i.e., oxysterols) are able to induce proinflammatory and profibrogenic mechanisms in liver cells.",M2
19134049,"Embryonic stem cells reduce liver fibrosis in <e>CCl4</e>-treated mice.We transplanted undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells into the spleens of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-treated mice to determine their effects on liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride at 0.5 ml/kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice twice weekly for up to 20 weeks. Four weeks after the first injection, the mice were divided into two groups and those in group 1 received 1 x 10(5) ES cells genetically labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the spleens, while group 2 mice received 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. In group 1, GFP-immunopositive cells were retained and found in areas of fibrosis in the liver, and reduced liver fibrosis was observed as compared with group 2. Secondary transplantation of ES cells at 12 weeks after the initial transplantation enhanced the reduction in liver fibrosis. No teratoma formation or uncontrolled growth of ES cells in organs, including the liver and spleen, was observed in any of the mice. In the livers of group 1 mice, metalloproteinase 9-immunopositive cells derived from ES cells as well as those from the recipient were observed. These cells were also found to be immunopositive for the hepatoblast marker Delta-like (DlK-1), a member of the DlK-1 family of transmembrane proteins. These results suggest that ES-based cell therapy is potentially useful for liver fibrosis treatment and that reduction in CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis by transplantation of ES cells may be related closely to the emergence of metalloproteinase-producing hepatoblast-like cells.",M2
19099152,"An ultrasound and histomorphological analysis of experimental liver cirrhosis in rats.We investigated whether liver injury by dual exposure to ethanol and carbon tetrachloride (EtOH + <e>CCl4</e>) for 15 weeks would persist after hepatotoxic agents were removed (EtOH + CCl4/8wR). After 15 weeks of hepatic injury with ethanol (5.5%, m/v) and carbon tetrachloride (0.05, mL/kg, ip), 5 of 11 female Wistar rats were sacrificed. The other 6 rats were maintained for an additional 8 weeks without hepatotoxic agents. Ultrasonography showed increased liver echogenicity and dilation of portal vein caliber in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 0.22 +/- 0.01 cm, P &lt; 0.001; EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 0.21 +/- 0.02 cm, P &lt; 0.01) vs control (0.16 +/- 0.02 cm). Histopathology showed regenerative nodules in both experimental groups. Histomorphometry revealed increased fibrosis content in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 12.6 +/- 2.64%, P &lt; 0.001; EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 10.4 +/- 1.36%, P &lt; 0.05) vs control (2.2 +/- 1.21%). Collagen types I and III were increased in groups EtOH + CCl4 (collagen I: 2.5 +/- 1.3%, P &lt; 0.01; collagen III: 1.3 +/- 0.2%, P &lt; 0.05) and EtOH + CCl4/8wR (collagen I: 1.8 +/- 0.06%, P &lt; 0.05; collagen III: 1.5 +/- 0.8%, P &lt; 0.01) vs control (collagen I: 0.38 +/- 0.11%; collagen III: 0.25 +/- 0.06%).

Cirrhosis caused by the association of CCl4-EtOH remained for at least 8 weeks after removal of these hepatotoxic agents. Ultrasound images can be a useful tool to evaluate advanced hepatic alterations.",M2
19069843,"Curcumin-induced recovery from hepatic injury involves induction of apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells.Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) undergo activation and transdifferentiation to myofibroblast like cells in liver injury, leading to liver fibrosis. During recovery from injury, activated HSCs may either revert back to quiescent state or undergo apoptosis or both. In the present study, we have examined whether recovery from hepatic injury involves apoptosis of activated HSCs and tested whether curcumin (the yellow pigment from Curcuma longa Linn.) promotes recovery from hepatic injury by inducing apoptosis of these cells. Hepatic injury was induced by <e>CCl4</e> and apoptosis was studied in HSCs isolated from liver by MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, and DAPI and annexin staining. Hepatic recovery was assessed by measuring hepatic marker activities, such as serum GOT, GPT and protein. Hepatic recovery occurred within 4 weeks after inducing injury in untreated control, whereas curcumin treatment caused hepatic recovery within 2 weeks, as evidenced by the reduction of hepatic marker activities to near normal levels. HSCs isolated from liver of animals treated with curcumin showed maximum apoptotic marker activities in 2nd week, whereas in HSCs from untreated control recovering from injury, maximum apoptosis was observed in 4th week. Induction of apoptosis in vivo during hepatic recovery was also suggested by increase in caspase-3 activity. Treatment of isolated HSCs in culture with curcumin caused apoptosis during later stages confirming that curcumin induced apoptosis of activated HSCs and not in unactivated quiescent HSCs. These results suggested that hepatoprotective effect of curcumin causing recovery from injury involved apoptosis of activated HSCs.",M2
19069636,"Bone marrow cell transplant does not prevent or reverse murine liver cirrhosis.We tested the effect of bone marrow cell (BMC) transplantation in either preventing or reversing cirrhosis on an experimental model of chronic liver disease. Female Wistar rats were fed a liquid alcohol diet and received intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) over 15 weeks. Ten animals (cell-treated group) received five injections of BMCs during the cirrhosis induction protocol (on the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th weeks) and four animals received the cells after liver injury was established through tail vein. Nine animals (nontreated group) were submitted to the previously described protocols; however, they received vehicle injections. Analyses were performed to verify whether the infusion of cells was effective in preventing the development of cirrhosis in our model of induction, and if the cells could reverse cirrhosis once it was established. Hepatic architecture and fibrotic septa were analyzed in liver slices stained with hematoxilin &amp; eosin and Sirius red, respectively. Fibrosis quantification was measured by Sirius red histomorphometry. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the amount of tissue transglutaminase 2. Blood analyses were performed to assess liver injury and function by the assessment of alanine aminotransferase and albumin. Ultrasound was performed to analyze the portal vein caliber and presence of ascitis. Cirrhosis features (regenerative nodules and fibrous septa) were observed in histopathology after 15 weeks of continuous hepatic injury in nontreated and cell-treated groups. Collagen content, immunofluorescence analysis, and biochemical and ultrasound parameters were similar in nontreated and cell-treated groups; however, both groups showed significant differences compared to a normal control group. Cell infusions with bone marrow-derived cells seem to be ineffective in improving morphofunctional parameters of the liver when applied to chronic cases either during or after establishment of the hepatic lesion.",M2
19058329,"Restrictive model of compensated carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis in rats.AIM: To develop a simplified and quick protocol to induce cirrhosis and standardize models of partial liver resection in rats. METHODS: In Fischer F344 rats two modified protocols of phenobarbital-carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) (dilution 50%) gavage to induce cirrhosis (frequency adjusted according to weight, but each subsequent dose was systematically administered) were tested, i.e. the rapid and slow protocols. Prothrombin time (PT) and total bilirubin (TB) were also evaluated. Animals from the rapid group underwent 15% hepatectomy and animals from the slow group underwent 70% hepatectomy. RESULTS: Rapid protocol: This corresponded to 1 gavage/4 d over 6 wk (mortality 30%). Mean PT was 35.2+/-2.8 s (normal: 14.5 s), and mean TB was 1.8+/-0.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.1 mg/dL). Slow protocol: This corresponded to 1 gavage/6 d over 9 wk (mortality 10%). Mean PT was 11.8+/-0.2 s (normal: 14.5 s), and mean TB was 0.4+/-0.04 mg/dL (normal: 0.1 mg/dL). Pathological analyses were performed in both protocols which showed persistent cirrhosis at 3 mo. Rat mortality in the rapid gavage group who underwent 15% hepatectomy and in the slow gavage group who underwent 70% hepatectomy was 50% and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our modified model is a simplified method to induce cirrhosis which is rapid (6 to 9 wk), efficient and stable up to 3 mo. Using this method,  Child Pugh A  or  Child Pugh BC  cirrhotic rats were obtained. Our models of cirrhosis and hepatectomy can be used in various situations focusing on postoperative survival.",M2
19053324,"Bile acids metabonomic study on the <e>CCl4</e>- and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced animal models: quantitative analysis of 22 bile acids by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Bile acids (BAs) are crucial for the diagnosis, follow-up, and prognostics of liver and intestinal disorders and other diseases affecting BA metabolism. A rapid, simple, and sensitive analytical method is needed to demonstrate the full metabolic profile and simultaneously determine the individual BAs in biological samples. In our present study, an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method has been established and validated for simultaneous quantitation of 22 BAs and a metabonomic study was performed based on the chemometric analysis of the serum samples from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced liver failure rats. The optimal chromatographic condition was effected by UPLC (Acquity UPLC BEH column, 1.7 microm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm) using a linear gradient elution system of methanol-5 mM ammonium acetate containing 0.01% acetic acid after a simple-step deproteinization by precipitation. The separation of the 22 BAs can be finished in less than 12 min, and the concentrations of these BAs in rat serums were simultaneously determined using a selective ions monitoring mode. The method was validated with respect to repeatability (relative standard deviation &lt; 9.78%) and accuracy (relative errors from -13.55 to 9.58%). The range of each BA was found from not detected (nd) to 8301 ng mL(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the developed method was successfully applied to the metabonomics analysis of BAs in CCl4- and ANIT-induced liver failure rats, using principle component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis. The serum samples from the two types of rat liver injury could be distinguished from each other and from the untreated animals according to the varieties of BAs. It indicated that the level of BAs could be considered as a sensitive parameter of hepatotoxicity induced by different chemical toxins. This novel metabonomics study of BAs based on the UPLC-MS profile provides not only an accurate quantitative assay of the serum concentrations of biomarkers but also a promising methodology for evaluation of liver injury.",M2
19042008,"Physical control on <e>CCl4</e> and CHCl3 desorption from artificially contaminated and aged sediments with supercritical carbon dioxide.The long-term interactions of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) and chloroform (CHCl(3)) with sediments that are low in organic matter (OM) are not well studied. In this study, CCl(4) and CHCl(3) were mixed with supercritical carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and loaded onto columns packed with two sediments with low OM and different textures, to establish contamination and achieve expedited artificial aging. The columns were subsequently leached with a simulated groundwater under hydraulically saturated conditions. Scanning electron microscopy was used to inspect the morphology of sediment single particles, determine the degree of particle association in aggregates and qualitatively estimate porosity and the possible diffusional pathways that might affect the overall contaminant desorption rates. Results demonstrated that most of contaminant inventories were rapidly released in the first pore volume of effluent, although a small portion of contaminants' total mass exhibited time-dependent desorption. The calculated K(d) values of CCl(4) or CHCl(3) partition were negligibly small. Both contaminants had similar transport behavior which was simulated well with a distributed (multiple)-rate (DR) statistical model. The model accounted for the apparent contaminant mass transfer through diffusional pathways of different lengths, towards the advective pores. The distribution of contaminant mass between equilibrium and kinetic fractions, the distribution of the individual rate constants, and the average rate constants calculated with the parameters of the gamma-distribution function (beta and eta) of the DR model, were sediment (texture) dependent. This indicated that contaminant desorption during the late stage of leaching was driven by concentration gradients (i.e., diffusion) within sediment matrix porosity.",M2
19034232,"Acute renal failure induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats with hepatic cirrhosis.Relationship between cirrhosis and renal dysfunction is not yet fully understood. A model of cirrhosis with acute hepatic and renal damage (RF), produced by <e>CCl4</e> in rats, with hemodynamic and renal functional alterations, similar to those observed in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) in man, was used to study chemical nephrotoxicity in animals. We performed in male Wistar rats hepatic and renal functional and hemodynamic studies in control, cirrhotic and decompensated cirrhotic (DC) groups. Cirrhosis was induced with carbon tetrachloride by chronic administration. Association between liver and renal functional alterations was detected in rats with decompensated cirrhosis, showing fall in mean arterial pressure and reduction of glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction. Renal hemodynamics did not change in cirrhotic rats, similarly to what occurs in compensated cirrhotic patients. However, DC rats exhibited increased sodium, glucose and phosphate urinary excretions and decreased ATP in renal cortex. DC animals had severe hypoglycemia. There was an extensive liver fibrosis. Glomeruli had hypercellularity and tubules showed extensive vacuolization in cirrhotic and DC rats. The present study suggests that in this model, damage typical of acute tubular necrosis ensues in cirrhotic rats. We describe functional and morphological damage in liver and kidney in a model of cirrhosis that might predispose to the development of acute renal failure when an individual with hepatic damage is exposed in acute way to chemical toxicants.",M2

19001734,"[Curative effect of interferon-alpha on rat liver fibrosis induced by <e>CCl4</e>]OBJECTIVE: To explore the curative effect and the mechanism of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on rat liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. METHODS: Thirty-nine male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. The rats in the normal control group (n=10) received subcutaneous injection of peanut oil (0.003 mL/g body weight) for 10 weeks. Rat liver fibrosis was induced in 29 rats by 0.003 mL/g subcutaneous injection of 40% CCl4 (CCl4: peanut oil = 2:3), twice weekly for 10 weeks. In the 7th week, these 29 rats were randomly divided into a liver fibrosis group without treatment (n=15) and an IFN-alpha treatment group (n=14), which received subcutaneous injection of IFN-alpha-2b at 10(6) units per rat. The rats' liver tissue was collected and HE and Masson staining were performed to observe of pathological changes, stage of liver fibrosis,and semi-quantitative scoring. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA),and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the rat liver. RESULTS: The stage of liver fibrosis, semi-quantitative scoring of Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining of Collagen I in the liver fibrosis group were significantly higher than those of the normal controls (All P&lt;0.01), and those in the IFN-alpha treatment group were significantly lower than those of the liver fibrosis group(P&lt;0.05). The semi-quantitative immunohistochemical scoring of alpha-SMA and TGF-beta1 in the liver fibrosis group was significantly higher than those of the normal control (All P&lt;0.01), and that in the IFN-alpha treatment group was significantly lower than that of the liver fibrosis group (All P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of IFN-alpha can decrease the liver fibrogenesis induced by CCl4 in rats. The anti-fibrosis effect of IFN-alpha may be attributed to the inhibition of the hepatic stellate cells' activation to decrease TGF-beta1 expression.",M2
18996463,"Action mechanism of Yi Guan Jian Decoction on <e>CCl4</e> induced cirrhosis in rats.AIM OF STUDY: To investigate action mechanism of Yi Guan Jian Decoction on cirrhosis induced by CCl(4) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CCl(4) (3 mL/kg) for the first time and then olive oil CCl(4) solution 50% (2 mL/kg) was administered hypodermically to rats twice each week for 12 weeks. At the end of 8th week, rats were randomly divided into CCl(4) control group (n=10), Yi Guan Jian Decoction group (n=9) and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction group (n=9). Yi Guan Jian Decoction and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction were oral administrated per day respectively for 4 weeks, concomitantly continued CCl(4) administration. At 12th weekend, the rats were sacrificed for sampling and detection of liver function, histological changes of liver tissue, liver tissue hydroxyproline content and expression of alpha-SMA, CD68, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, Caspase-12, HGFalpha, MMP-2, MMP-9 and hepatocyte apoptotic index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (1) Compared with that of normal rats, expression of alpha-SMA, CD68 and TIMP-1 in liver tissue of 8 week model group rats increases significantly (P&lt;0.01), moreover further increased in the 12 week of model group. However, MMP-13, HGFalpha, TIMP-2 content decreases gradually and the statistical difference is seen between each time point (P&lt;0.01). Activity of MMP-2, MMP-9, content of Caspase-12 and hepatocyte apoptotic index increased gradually at 4th, 8th, 12th week. (2) Compared to that of the same time point model group, activity of MMP-9 and contents of MMP-13, TIMP-2 and HGFalpha in Yi Guan Jian Decoction group improves significantly (P&lt;0.01), and activity of MMP-2 and contents of alpha-SMA, TIMP-1, Caspase-12 and hepatocyte apoptotic index decreases significantly (P&lt;0.01). This work suggests that Yi Guan Jian Decoction exerts significant therapeutic effect on CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis in rats, through mechanism of inhibiting hepatocytes apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation, and regulating the function of Kupffer cell. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This study investigates the mechanism of Yi Guan Jian against cirrhosis from aspect of heptocytes apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation. It suggest that although of unknown bioactive ingredients, mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine recipe against cirrhosis can be disclosed and of profound significance.",M2
18989868,"Oral administration of diphenyl diselenide potentiates hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.Carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) is a model for studying free radical-induced liver injury and screening hepato-protective drugs. Numerous studies have reported the involvement of oxidative stress in CCl4-induced liver damage and the hepato-protective effects mediated by different antioxidants. The present study examined the effects of diphenyl diselenide, (PhSe)2, on hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 in rats. To this end, male Wistar rats received (PhSe)2 by oral route at the dosage of 31.2 mg/kg for one or two days. After the second day of treatment, rats received CCl4 orally in a single dose. The liver and kidney were utilized for determination of histopathology, biochemical [aspartate (ALT) and alanine (AST) aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirrubin (TB) and gamaglutamyl transferase (GGT)] and toxicological parameters [thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) levels, catalase activity, ascorbic acid, nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and aminolevulinate dehydratase (-ALA-D) activity]. Repeated administration of (PhSe)2 caused a marked potentiation of hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 exposure, as manifested by an increase in biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and BT) and severe alteration in histopathology. This study also demonstrated a potentiation of TBARS levels and a consequent depletion of important antioxidant defenses including catalase and ascorbic acid. Pre-treatment with a single dose of (PhSe)2 prevented the effect of strychnine, a substrate for CYPs, abolishing lethality in mice. This result indicates that (PhSe)2 prevented animal death, suggesting an activator action of (PhSe)2 in CYPs. This study clearly indicates that (PhSe)2 potentiated acute hepatic damage induced by CCl4.",M2
18971186,"[Comparison of two rat models of IgA nephropathy]OBJECTIVE: To study the methods for rapid establishment of rat models of IgA nephropathy. METHODS: Forty female SD rats weighing 160-200 g were randomized into 3 groups. In group A, the rats received intravenous injection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and oral bovine serum albumin (BSA), and in group B, <e>CCl4</e> was injected subcutaneously in addition to the above treatments; the rats in group C received no treatments to serve as the normal control group. The rats were sacrificed 10 and 14 weeks after the treatment for biochemical testing of the arterial blood and histopathological and IgA immunofluorescence examination of the renal tissues. The twenty-four-hour urine was collected at 10, 12, and 14 weeks after the treatments for detecting the urine proteins. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the rats in groups A and B showed significantly increased serum creatinine, urine nitrogen and protein levels. Pathological examination of the renal tissue showed mild to moderate mesangial expansion and mesangial cell proliferation in groups A and B, without obvious difference between the two groups; but hematuria and proteinuria occurred earlier in group B with stronger IgA immunofluorescence than in group A. CONCLUSION: Both of the methods used in group A and group B can successfully induce IgA nephropathy in rats, but in group B, hematuria and urineprotein occurs earlier and IgA immunofluorescence is more stronger. Therefore intravenous SEB injection combined with oral BSA and subcutaneous CCl4 administration is a better method for time-efficient establishment of rat models of IgA nephropathy.",M2

The gates were shown to fold via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and thereby form a C3nu symmetrical receptor: the 1H NMR resonance for the amide N-H protons of the pyridine gates appeared downfield (delta= 10.98 ppm), and the N-H vibrational stretch (IR) was observed at 3176 cm(-1).

The gearing of the pyridine  gates , about their axis, led to the interconversion of two dynamic enantiomers 1A and 1B comprising the clockwise and counterclockwise seam of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopic measurements and line-shape simulations suggested that the energy barrier of 10.0 kcal/mol (DeltaG++(A/B), 298 K) is required for the 1A/B interconversion, when <e>CCl4</e> occupies the cavity of 1. Likewise, the activation free energy for CCl4 departing the basket was found to be 13.1 kcal/mol (DeltaG++, 298 K), whereas the thermodynamic stability of 1:CCl4 complex was -2.7 kcal/mol (DeltaGdegrees, 298 K). In view of that, CCl4 (but also (CH3)3CBr) was proposed to escape from, and a molecule of solvent to enter, the basket when the gates rotate about their axis: the exit of CCl4 requires the activation energy of 12.7 kcal/mol (DeltaG++(A/B) + DeltaGdegrees), similar to the experimentally found 13.1 kcal/mol (DeltaG++).",M2
18830880,"Antioxidant and hepatoprotective potential of Aegle marmelos Correa. against <e>CCl4</e>-induced oxidative stress and early tumor events.The antioxidant properties and inhibitory effect on early tumor promoter markers of A. marmelos (25 and 50 mg/Kg b. wt. orally) have been evaluated. Male Wistar rats were pre-treated for seven consecutive days with A. marmelos prior to CCl4 (1 mL Kg(- 1) body weight p. o., in corn oil [1:1 v/v]) treatment. Pre-treatment with A. marmelos suppressed lipid peroxidation (LPO), xanthine oxidase (XO) and release of serum toxicity marker enzymes viz, SGOT, LDH, SGPT dose-dependently and significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Hepatic antioxidant status viz, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), quinone reductase (QR), catalase (CAT) were concomitantly restored in A. marmelos-treated groups (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, A. marmelos pretreatment also prevented the CCl4-enhanced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and hepatic DNA synthesis significantly (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity was strikingly attenuated by A. marmelos treatment and the study gives some insight into the mechanisms involved in diminution of free radical generating toxicants and enhancement of the antioxidant armory, hence preventing further tissue damage, injury and hyperproliferation. Thus, these findings indicate that A. marmelos attenuates CCl4-mediated hepatic oxidative stress, toxicity, tumor promotion and subsequent cell proliferation response in Wistar rats.",M2
18829979,"Superoxide dismutase gene transfer reduces portal pressure in <e>CCl4</e> cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension.BACKGROUND: Increased intrahepatic vascular tone in cirrhosis has been attributed to a decrease of hepatic nitric oxide (NO) secondary to disturbances in the post-translational regulation of the enzyme eNOS. NO scavenging by superoxide (O(2)(-)) further contributes to a reduction of NO bioavailability in cirrhotic livers. AIM: To investigate whether removing increased O(2)(-) levels could be a new therapeutic strategy to increase intrahepatic NO, improve endothelial dysfunction and reduce portal pressure in cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension. METHODS: Adenoviral vectors expressing extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) (AdECSOD) or beta-galactosidase (Adbetagal) were injected intravenously in control and CCl(4)-induced cirrhotic rats. After 3 days, liver O(2)(-) levels were determined by dihydroethidium staining, NO bioavailability by hepatic cGMP levels, nitrotyrosinated proteins by immunohistochemistry and western blot, and endothelial function by responses to acetylcholine in perfused rat livers. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and portal pressure were evaluated in vivo. RESULTS: Transfection of cirrhotic livers with AdECSOD produced a significant reduction in O(2)(-) levels, a significant increase in hepatic cGMP, and a decrease in liver nitrotyrosinated proteins which were associated with a significant improvement in the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine. In addition, in cirrhotic livers AdECSOD transfection produced a significant reduction in portal pressure (17.3 (SD 2) mm Hg vs 15 (SD 1.6) mm Hg; p&lt;0.05) without significant changes in MAP. In control rats, AdECSOD transfection prevents the increase in portal perfusion pressure promoted by an ROS-generating system. CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhotic rats, reduction of O(2)(-) by AdECSOD increases NO bioavailability, improves intrahepatic endothelial function and reduces portal pressure. These findings suggest that scavenging of O(2)(-) might be a new therapeutic strategy in the management of portal hypertension.",M2
18823437,"Dietary trans-resveratrol bioavailability and effect on <e>CCl4</e>-induced liver lipid peroxidation.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of pure trans-resveratrol (t-Res) to act as an anti-oxidant, but the scientific literature is lacking in in vivo studies dealing with dietary t-Res bioavailability in oxidative stress models. Our aim was to investigate the bioavailability of t-Res from dietary sources and its effect on an animal model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver lipid peroxidation. METHODS: Ten rats were intragastrically administered for 14 days with a grape-stalk extract determining a daily t-Res dosage of 3 mg/kg. The control group (10 rats) was daily injected with the vehicle solvent without the t-Res extract. After 1 week, the induction of liver lipid peroxidation by CCl4 injection was carried out. Serum and liver samples, at different time intervals, were collected to evaluate t-Res content, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectometry-mass spectometry (LC-MS-MS). Liver malondialdehyde (MDA) as marker of oxidative stress was measured. RESULTS: t-Res accumulates in the liver reaching 49.8 +/- 10.2 ng/g after 7 days and 191.8 +/- 15.3 ng/g after 14 days. No t-Res was detected in serum. The increase of MDA liver concentration due to CCl4 injection after 24 h and 1 week was reduced by 38% and a 63%, respectively, by the treatment with the t-Res extract. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate consumption of t-Res from a dietary source resulted in a time-dose-dependent liver accumulation. It was able to counteract in vivo CCl4-induced liver lipid peroxidation thus demonstrating the hepatoprotective property of t-Res.",M2
18812033,"Protective effects of total flavonoids of Bidens bipinnata L. against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in rats.Bidens bipinnata L. is well known in China as a traditional Chinese medicine and has been used to treat hepatitis in clinics for many years. In a previous study we found that total flavonoids of Bidens bipinnata L. (TFB) had a protective effect against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Now this study was designed to investigate its therapeutic effect against CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats and to determine, in part, its mechanism of action. The liver fibrosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50% CCl4 twice a week for 18 weeks. TFB (40, 80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) was administered by gastrogavage daily from the 9th week. The results showed that TFB (80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) treatment for 10 weeks significantly reduced the elevated liver index (liver weight/body weight) and spleen index (spleen weight/body weight), elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), hyaluronic acid, type III procollagen and hepatic hydroxyproline. In addition, TFB markedly inhibited CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation and enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, TFB (80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) treatment improved the morphologic changes of hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 and suppressed nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) protein expression and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 gene expression in the liver of liver fibrosis of rats. In conclusion, TFB was able to ameliorate liver injury and protect rats from CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by suppressing oxidative stress. This process may be related to inhibiting the induction of NF-kappaB on hepatic stellate cell activation and the expression of TGF-beta1.",M2
18811677,"Trolox down-regulates transforming growth factor-beta and prevents experimental cirrhosis.Cirrhosis is a very common disease and its treatment is limited due to lack of effective drugs. Some studies indicate that this disease is associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of trolox, an effective antioxidant, on experimental cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was induced by <e>CCl4</e> administration (0.4 g/kg, intraperitoneally, three times per week, for 8 weeks) to Wistar male rats. Trolox was administered daily (50 mg/kg, orally). Fibrosis was assessed histologically and by measuring liver hydroxyproline content. Glutathione, lipid peroxidation and glycogen were measured in liver; serum markers of liver damage were also quantified. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was determined by Western blot and quantified densitometrically. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase increased in the group receiving CCl4; trolox completely or partially prevented these alterations. Glycogen was almost depleted by CCl4 but was partially preserved by trolox. Lipid peroxidation increased while glutathione decreased by CCl4 administration; trolox corrected both effects. Histology showed thick bands of collagen, necrosis and distortion of the hepatic parenchyma in the CCl4 group, such effects were prevented by trolox. Hydroxyproline content increased 5-fold by CCl4, while the group receiving both CCl4 and trolox showed no significant difference compared to the control group. CCl4 increased 3-fold TGF-beta, while trolox completely prevented this increase. We found that trolox effectively prevented cirrhosis induced with CCl4 in the rat. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of trolox may be associated to its antioxidant properties and to its ability to reduce the profibrogenic cytokine TGF-beta expression.",M2
18807755,"Effect of Phyllanthus niruri Linn. treatment on liver, kidney and testes in <e>CCl4</e> induced hepatotoxic rats.Phyllanthus niruri extract is extensively used in treating liver ailments. Effects of aqueous extract of P. niruri on liver, kidney and testes of CCl4 induced hepatotoxic rats were studied. High levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in the CCl4 test group with significant reduction of MDA levels in all groups on P. niruri extract administration. Highest levels of glutathione (GSH) were found in P. niruri group. Activities of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes were significantly reduced in the curative group (P. niruri treatment after CCl4 injection). Histopathology of liver showed lesser degree of inflammation in all P. niruri treated groups while the renal and seminiferous tubules showed eosinophilic protein casts with signs of tubular damage and degeneration. Testes also showed decreased amount of mature spermatozoa. The results suggest that P. niruri has anti-oxidant and hepato-protective activity with associated deleterious effects on kidney and testes.",M2

Pretreatment with 70% ethanolic extract of M. tuberosa reversed CCl4 induced elevation of levels of serum biomarkers to near normal levels, suggesting that the tubers of M. tuberosa possess hepatoprotective property and this property may be attributed to the antioxidant property of the plant.",M2
18788625,"[Dendritic cell vaccine modified by murine mAFP gene enhances immunoprotective effect on liver carcinogenesis and tumor development in mice]OBJECTIVE: To construct a dendritic cell vaccine transduced by murine alpha-fetoprotein (mAFP) gene, and evaluate its immunoprotective effect on C57BL/6J mice during the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma by diethylnitrosamines, carbon tetrachloride and ethanol. METHODS: Dendritic cells (DCs) were induced and augmented by murine IL-4 and GM-CSF, and transfected by recombinant adenovirus engineered with mAFP gene. Major MHC class I and II, B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), CD18a, and CD54 molecules on DC were analyzed by FACS. 80 C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (20 mice per group): Simple DC inoculated group, pAdBM5-mAFP-DC inoculated group, pAdBM5-mAFP plasmid inoculated group, and PBS control group. They were immunized once with 5 x 10(5) DCs (0.1 ml)/mouse administered s. c. in the left flank or 100 mg pAdBMS-mAFP plasmid/mouse administered i. m. in the left tibialis anterior muscle. Inoculation was conducted once a week for 4 weeks after 3 times consecutive immunization initially. At the same time of immunization, DEN/<e>CCl4</e>/ethanol were given to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor incidence was assessed after 20 weeks. RESULTS: A transgenic DC vaccine was successfully constructed and the mAFP transgenic DCs expressed high level molecules of major MHC class I and II , B7.1, B7.2, CD18a, and CD54. After the 20-week induction, the incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC) was 70.0% in simple DC inoculated group, 25.0% in pAdBMS-mAFP-DC inoculated group, 65.0% in pAdBM5-mAFP plasmid inoculated group, and 75.0% in PBS control group. There was a significant difference between group B and other groups (P &lt; 0.05).

18787281,"Hepatoprotective effects of setarud against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats.To assess the hepatoprotective activity of a new herbal drug  setarud  in experimental liver fibrosis, 48 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: controls, carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) group, and two treatment groups that received CCl4 and setarud at doses of 0.02 or 0.04 g/Kg/day for 30 days. Body weight gain, biochemical liver tests, bile flow rate and composition, and changes in liver morphology in the four groups were studied. CCl4 administration led to morphological and biochemical evidence of liver injury as compared to untreated controls. Setarud administration led to significant protection against CCl4-induced changes in body weight gain, liver morphology, bile flow and concentration. It was also associated with significantly lower serum liver enzyme levels (p&lt;0.01), higher serum albumin level, and reduced increase in narcotic-induced sleeping time. Thus, setarud showed protective activity against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Further studies of its efficacy in liver disease are warranted.",M2
18786523,"Pleurotus ostreatus, an oyster mushroom, decreases the oxidative stress induced by carbon tetrachloride in rat kidneys, heart and brain.The present work is aimed at evaluating the protective effect of the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced toxicity in male Wistar rats. Significantly elevated mean levels (p&lt;0.05) of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lowered mean levels (p&lt;0.01) of reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamins C and E (p&lt;0.05) were observed in kidneys, heart and brain of rats exposed to CCl4, when compared to values in normal rats. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) revealed lower activities of these antioxidant enzymes in the kidneys, heart and brain of rats exposed to CCl4. When the extract of P. ostreatus was used to treat rats with CCl4-induced toxicity, it lowered the mean level of MDA, elevated the mean levels of GSH and of vitamins C and E and enhanced the mean activities of CAT, SOD, Gpx and GST so that the values of most of these parameters did not differ significantly from those of normal rats. Histopathological studies confirmed the toxic effects of CCl4 on other organs such as kidneys, heart and brain and also tissue protective effect of the extract of P. ostreatus. These results suggest that an extract of P. ostreatus is able to alleviate the oxidative damage caused by CCl4 in the kidneys, heart and brain of Wistar rats.",M2
18783728,"Hepatoprotective activity of Amaranthus spinosus in experimental animals.The hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity of 50% ethanolic extract of whole plant of Amaranthus spinosus (ASE) was evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) induced hepatic damage in rats. The ASE at dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were administered orally once daily for fourteen days. The substantially elevated serum enzymatic levels of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (AST), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP) and total bilirubin were restored towards normalization significantly by the ASE in a dose dependent manner. Higher dose exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. Meanwhile, in vivo antioxidant activities as malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroperoxides, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also screened which were also found significantly positive in a dose dependent manner. The results of this study strongly indicate that whole plants of A. spinosus have potent hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatic damage in experimental animals. This study suggests that possible mechanism of this activity may be due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolics compound in the ASE which may be responsible to hepatoprotective activity.",M2
18756597,"Ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes after taurine treatment in <e>CCl4</e> induced liver injury.AIM: To search the organelle based changes in hepatocytes after taurine treatment in experimental liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) administration. METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 15) was injected with CCl(4) plus taurine and Group 2 (n = 15) with CCl(4) plus saline for 12 wk. At the end of 12th wk, mitochondria, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei of hepatocytes were evaluated using a scoring system. The results were compared with histopathological findings, as well. RESULTS: Taurine treatment reduced fibrosis scores significantly as compared to placebo. Organelle injury scores decreased significantly with taurine treatment. Ultrastructural and histopathological scores in both groups were in strong correlation (r = 0.931 for CCl(4) plus taurine and r = 0.899 for CCl(4) plus saline group). CONCLUSION: Organelle based transmission electron microscopy findings can reflect successfully histological results as well as tissue healing in hepatocytes from hepatotoxin-induced liver fibrosis.",M2
18724385,"The antioxidant activity of chondroitin-4-sulphate, in carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatitis in mice, involves NF-kappaB and caspase activation.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reactive oxygen species (ROC) are the main causes of carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced acute liver injury. Chondroitin-4-sulphate (C4S) is known to inhibit lipid peroxidation through antioxidant mechanisms. Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and caspases may strongly intensify inflammation and cell damage, in addition to that directly exerted by ROS. We investigated whether treatment with C4S, besides exerting antioxidant activity, was able to modulate NF-kappaB and apoptosis activation in CCl4-induced liver injury in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Acute hepatitis was induced in mice by an i.p. injection of CCl(4). Varying doses of C4S were administered i.p. 1 h before, 6 and 12 h after CCl4 injection. 24 h after CCl4 injection, the mice were killed for biochemical and histological analysis. KEY RESULTS: CCl4 injection produced: marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; hepatic membrane lipid peroxidation, assayed by 8-isoprostane levels; and depletion of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase. CCl4 also decreased NF-kappaB translocation and IkBalpha, and increased gene expression of mRNA and protein of metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and -9, and of pro- and cleaved forms of caspases-3 and -7. There was also increased liver polymorphonuclear infiltration, evaluated by elastase assay, and hepatic cell disruption.C4S treatment inhibited lipid peroxidation; blocked NF-kappaB activation and IkBalpha protein loss; decreased mRNA and proteins for MMPs and caspases; restored endogenous antioxidants; limited hepatic polymorphonuclear accumulation and tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As antioxidants may inhibit NF-kappaB and caspase activation, we hypothesize that treatment with C4S was able to inhibit NF-kappaB and apoptosis activation in hepatic injury.",M2
18705752,"Curcumin prevents and reverses cirrhosis induced by bile duct obstruction or <e>CCl4</e> in rats: role of TGF-beta modulation and oxidative stress.Curcumin is a phytophenolic compound, which is highly efficacious for treating several inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in preventing or reversing liver cirrhosis. A 4-week bile duct ligation (BDL) rat model was used to test the ability of curcumin (100 mg/kg, p.o., daily) to prevent cirrhosis. To reverse cirrhosis, CCl(4) was administered chronically for 3 months, and then it was withdrawn and curcumin administered for 2 months. Alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, liver histopathology, bilirubin, glycogen, reduced and oxidized glutathione, and TGF-beta (mRNA and protein) levels were assessed. Curcumin preserved normal values of markers of liver damage in BDL rats. Fibrosis, assessed by measuring hydroxyproline levels and histopathology, increased nearly fivefold after BDL and this effect was partially but significantly prevented by curcumin. BDL increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) levels (mRNA and proteins), while curcumin partially suppressed this mediator of fibrosis. Curcumin also partially reversed the fibrosis induced by CCl(4). Curcumin was effective in preventing and reversing cirrhosis, probably by its ability of reducing TGF-beta expression. These data suggest that curcumin might be an effective antifibrotic and fibrolitic drug in the treatment of chronic hepatic diseases.",M2
18664124,"[Morphometry of hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus in normal and cirrhotic rat liver]Morphometric electron microscopy study of the hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus and morphofunctional analysis of the degree of pathological alterations were carried out on the liver of rats with <e>CCL4</e>-cirrhosis (experimental group). Chronic poisoning of rats with CCL4 for 6 months led to a 4.2-fold increase in proportion of connective tissue and to a decrease in the number of hepatocytes in the liver by 21.8 %. Dry mass and ploidy of hepatocytes in the cirrhotis liver rose as compared with norm by 20.6 and 9.3%, respectively. Activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in blood of rats of experimental group exceeded normal ones 2.0 and 1.4 times, respectively. Concentration of total bilirubin in blood of the cirrhotic animals increased 1.7 times, while concentration of total protein decreased by 22%. Concentration of diene conjugates in the liver of rats of experimental group increased 2.1 times as compared with normal one, while the level of malonic dialdehyde - by 34%. Activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the cirrhotic liver were lower than in the normal liver were lower than in the normal liver by 16 and 23 %, respectively. Morphometry of the hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus has shown that in spite of an increase in the voluminous density of mitochondria in hepatocytes of the cirrhotic liver (by 28 %), concentration of internal mitochondrial membranes in the cells was reduced almost 1.5 times, while the total length of internal membrane in a single mitochondrion was reduced about twice as compared with norm. Thus, despite compensation of the partial loss of hepatocytes because of their polyploidization and hypertrophy, the specific synthetic activity of cells in the case of cirrhosis is decreased due to deterioration of the antioxidant system and electron transport chain of the mitochondrial apparatus.",M2
18626430,"Black bean extract ameliorates liver fibrosis in rats with <e>CCl4</e>-induced injury.We assessed the anti-fibrotic effects of methanolic black bean extract antioxidants in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) liver injury model in rats. Experimentally intoxicated animals received CCl4 for eight weeks, the reference and test groups received daily intragastric quercetin or daily intragastric black bean extract. Liver fibrosis was assessed and quantified using morphometric analysis. Expression of fibrosis related genes was measured by real time RT-PCR. Qualitative and quantitative histological analysis showed that administration of 70 mg/kg b.w. of black bean extract reduced hepatic fibrosis index by 18% compared to positive controls (P 0.006), as a result of a decrease in type I (44.3% less, P 0.03) and type IV (68.9% less, P 0.049) collagen gene expression compared to CCl4-injured and Quercetin treated rats. In conclusion, we provide evidence that this methanol black bean extract ameliorates liver fibrosis and types I and IV collagen gene expression, in the animal model used. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The compounds contained in this black bean extract exhibited strong antifibrotic effects in the CCl4 chronic liver injury model used; considering that this compounds are contained in a leguminous that has been used in human diet for a long time, their toxic potential should be very low, and this characteristic should favor their potential use in some other chronic or degenerative states that include an increase in inflammation and oxidative burst in their pathogenesis. Another possible application of this kind of extract could be its use as an antimicrobial or even antiparasitic therapeutic agent, although it is purely speculative.",M2
18622472,"Role of N-acetylcysteine on fibrosis and oxidative stress in cirrhotic rats.BACKGROUND: Hepatic cirrhosis is the final stage of liver dysfunction, characterized by diffuse fibrosis which is the main response to the liver injury. The inhalatory carbon tetrachloride is an effective experimental model that triggers cirrhosis and allows to obtain histological and physiological modifications similar to the one seen in humans. AIM: To investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the fibrosis and oxidative stress in the liver of cirrhotic rats, analyzing liver function tests, lipoperoxidation, activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme, collagen quantification, histopathology, as well as the nitric oxide role. METHODS: The animals were randomly in three experimental groups: control (CO); cirrhotic (<e>CCl4</e>) and CCl4 + NAC. Evaluate the lipid peroxidation, the glutathione peroxidase enzyme, the collagen and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). RESULTS: The cirrhotic group treated with N-acetylcysteine showed trough the histological analysis and collagen quantification lower degrees of fibrosis. This group has also shown less damage to the cellular membranes, less decrease on the glutathione peroxidase levels and less expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase when matched with the cirrhotic group without treatment. CONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine seams to offer protection against hepatic fibrosis and oxidative stress in cirrhotic rat livers.",M2
18602877,"A metabonomic characterization of <e>CCl4</e>-induced acute liver failure using partial least square regression based on the GC/MS metabolic profiles of plasma in mice.This work characterized the metabolism disorders of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in a mouse model with different dosage of intoxication (100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg). Metabolic profiles of mice plasma were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after chemical derivatization. Here an effective information-extracting approach was implemented on the basis of partial least square regression analysis (PLS-RA). PLS modeling was achieved with two kinds of Y-vectors for the acquired metabonomics data and eight metabolites with different changing behaviors were selected. ALF of mice induced by CCl(4) was characterized by the elevation of glutamate, citrate, serine and threonine, as well as the decrease of alpha-glycerophosphate, docosahexaenoic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid in plasma. The difference in the concentrations of serine, threonine, palmitic acid and oleic acid remained insignificant between the control and 100mg/kg groups, while significant distinction appeared when comparing the control and two higher dosed groups. The underlying regulation of CCl(4)-perturbed metabolic pathways was discussed according to the selected metabolites. The present study demonstrated a great potential of PLS-RA in exploiting a comprehensive metabolic effects of CCl(4) intoxication and its efficient capability to reveal the hepatotoxic mechanism of ALF induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS).",M2
18602778,"A study on antioxidant, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective actions of Aegiceras corniculatum (stem) extracts.AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective potential of Aegiceras corniculatum Linn. Blanco (Aegicerataceae). METHODS AND RESULTS: The n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, derived from Aegiceras corniculatum stems, scavenged superoxide anions (O2*) and hydroxyl radicals (*OH) in nitro blue tetrazolium reduction and deoxyribose degradation assays, respectively. All the extracts inhibited the process of lipid peroxidation at its initiation step. Additionally, in rat liver microsomes n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts also caused termination of radical chain reaction supporting their scavenging action towards lipid peroxy radicals (LOO*). Moreover, increased production of O2* in human neutrophils, stimulated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and/or opsonized zymosan were also suppressed (IC50 approximately 3-20 microg/mL). Thereby, revealing the ability of plant extracts to antagonize the oxidative stress via interference with NADPH oxidase metabolic pathway. These in vitro results coincide with the reduction in the glucose oxidase-induced paw edema in mice in the presence of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (10, 50, and 100mg/kg, i.p.). Plant extracts (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly protected the carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced oxidative tissue injury in rat liver. This was reflected by a approximately 60% decline in the levels of serum aminotransferase enzymes. CONCLUSION: Aegiceras corniculatum extracts found to possess pronounced antioxidant effect that may be at least in part related to its anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities. This study provides a scientific basis for the ethnomedical claims that Aegiceras corniculatum is effective against inflammation and liver injury.",M2
18593218,"Using artificial burrows to evaluate inhalation risks to burrowing mammals.Since the onset of plutonium production at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site, several hundred cubic meters of carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) has been discharged to the soil column, resulting in a dispersed CCI4 vapor plume in the subsurface. Inhalation of volatile organic chemicals could be an important exposure pathway for burrowing animals there. Historical levels of CCl4 in soil pore gas exceeded the inhalation ecological screening level for CCl4. Thus, the inhalation exposure pathway was evaluated with the use of artificial burrows deployed at locations that had elevated levels of CCl4 in soil gas. Artificial burrows were designed on the basis of information available for Hanford Site fossorial wildlife. After installation, the artificial burrow atmosphere was sampled and analyzed for CCl4 and its degradation products: chloroform, methylene chloride, and chloromethane. Sampling was repeated on 3 occasions to capture varying atmospheric conditions affecting exposure concentrations. CCl4 was detected in the artificial burrows, and maximum exposures were observed during relatively low barometric conditions. The highest CCl4 detections were still well below the inhalation-based ecological screening level and CCl4 degradation products were never detected. This study shows that artificial burrows are an efficient method for obtaining relevant exposure data and illustrates the utility of directly measuring the medium for exposure under ecologically realistic conditions.",M2

In this study, we investigated the effect of artichoke extract pretreatment on carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>)-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. Rats were given artichoke leaf extract (1.5g/kg/day) by gavage for 2 weeks and after then CCl4 (1ml/kg; i.p.) was applied. All rats were killed 24h after the CCl4 injection. CCl4 administration resulted in hepatic necrosis and significant increases in plasma transaminase activities as well as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and diene conjugate (DC) levels in the liver of rats. Glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels decreased, but vitamin E levels increased in the liver of CCl4-treated rats. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities remained unchanged, but glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities decreased following CCl4 treatment. In rats pretreated with artichoke extract, significant decreases in plasma transaminase activities and amelioration in histopathological changes in the liver were observed following CCl4 treatment as compared to CCl4-treated rats. In addition, hepatic MDA and DC levels decreased, but GSH levels and GSH-Px activities increased without any change in other antioxidant parameters following CCl4 treatment in artichoke-pretreated rats. The present findings indicate that in vivo architoke extract administration may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity.",M2
18547752,"Up-regulation of hepatic heme oxygenase-1 expression by locally induced interleukin-6 in rats administered carbon tetrachloride intraperitoneally.We previously reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) was locally produced in the early period after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous carbon tetrachloride (<e>CCl4</e>) administration, but not after oral (p.o.) administration. In the present study, we focused on the up-regulation of stress-inducible proteins induced by IL-6 after i.p. CCl4 administration. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (EC 1.14.99.3) mRNA and protein were induced more in rats administered CCl4 via the i.p. route, compared with the p.o. route; however, expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 72 and HSP90 mRNA were increased to similar extents in both experimental groups. The induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein after i.p. CCl4 administration were significantly reduced after pretreatment with anti-rat IL-6 antibody. Activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), which promotes HO-1 expression, peaked together with plasma levels of IL-6 after i.p. CCl4 administration, suggesting that hepatic HO-1 expression was increased by IL-6 via the Janus kinase/STAT3 pathway. The present data indicate that hepatic HO-1 is up-regulated by endogenously produced IL-6, in addition to its up-regulation by heme derived from cytochrome P450 which has already been reported in rats administered i.p. CCl4. The up-regulation of hepatic HO-1 expression may reduce the tissue injury to livers caused by CCl4.",M2
18534709,"Three-day tetrahydrobiopterin therapy increases in vivo hepatic NOS activity and reduces portal pressure in <e>CCl4</e> cirrhotic rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tetrahydrobiopterin is an essential cofactor for NOS enzymes to synthesize NO. It has been suggested that reduced intrahepatic tetrahydrobiopterin decreases intrahepatic NO and contributes to increase hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure in cirrhosis. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation in portal pressure in CCl4 cirrhotic rats. METHODS: Cirrhotic rats received vehicle or tetrahydrobiopterin (10mg/kg/day i.p.) for 3 days. Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics and hepatic tetrahydrobiopterin, NOS activity and cGMP levels were measured. In addition, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were evaluated in normal rats in which tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency was induced by administrating 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine (DAHP) for 8h. RESULTS: In cirrhotic rats, tetrahydrobiopterin administration increased liver NOS activity and cGMP levels and markedly and significantly reduced portal pressure. Amelioration of portal hypertension was associated with a normalization of arterial pressure. In normal rats DAHP decreased hepatic tetrahydrobiopterin and NOS activity and increased hepatic vascular tone. These effects of DAHP administration were corrected by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that tetrahydrobiopterin markedly reduces portal hypertension and improves systemic hemodynamics in cirrhotic rats. These data support the concept that tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation may represent a new therapeutic strategy for portal hypertension.",M2
18598176,"Saengshik, a formulated health food, prevents liver damage in <e>CCl4</e>-induced mice and increases antioxidant activity in elderly women.Saengshik is a Korean noncooked food made with of more than 30 different whole gains, vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, and seaweeds. All of these ingredients are frozen and dried to minimize the loss of nutrients. Saengshik has become popular among health-conscious people in the Republic of Korea. The study aims to investigate antioxidant effects of Saengshik by in vivo and human experiments. In in vivo tests, mice were fed Saengshik for 4 weeks, and oxidative damage was induced by CCl(4). Then the effects of Saengshik on oxidative damage were examined. It was found that plasma lipid hydroperoxide and protein oxidative damages were significantly suppressed and antioxidants, glutathione, and thiol groups were increased. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase was increased, and the level of glutamate pyruvate transaminase was decreased. In a human study, elderly people were given Saengshik for 24 weeks, and changes in antioxidant defense of the body were examined. Antioxidant activities in plasma were enhanced, although the difference was not significant. Therefore, it is expected that Saengshik is effective at removing oxidants from body tissues, preventing oxidative damage, and eventually boosting the antioxidant capacity of the body.",M2
18598162,"Curcumin or saikosaponin a improves hepatic antioxidant capacity and protects against <e>CCl4</e>-induced liver injury in rats.Curcumin and saikosaponin a, the bioactive phytochemicals of turmeric and Bupleurum, act as antioxidants. This study investigated the effects of supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a on hepatic lipids and antioxidant status in rats with CCl(4)-induced liver injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, CCl(4), CCl(4) + curcumin (0.005%; CU), CCl(4) + saikosaponin a (0.004%; SS), and CCl(4) + curcumin + saikosaponin a (0.005% + 0.004%; CU+SS) groups. CCl(4) (40% in olive oil) was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.75 mL/kg once a week. Curcumin and/or saikosaponin a was administered orally 1 week before CCl(4) injection for 8 weeks. The pathological results showed that liver fibrosis was ameliorated in the SS and CU+SS groups. After 8 weeks, supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a significantly decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, as well as plasma and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The CU+SS group showed reversal of the impaired hepatic superoxide dismutase activity and an increase in total glutathione level. Supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a significantly improved hepatic antioxidant status and suppressed malondialdehyde formation. Therefore, supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a protects against CCl(4)-induced liver injury by attenuating hepatic lipids and lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant defense. Curcumin and saikosaponin a had no additive effects on hepatoprotection except for greater improvement in the total glutathione level and antioxidant status.",M2
