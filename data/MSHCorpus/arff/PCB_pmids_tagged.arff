20526953,"Evidence of weak contaminant-related oxidative stress in glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) from the Canadian Arctic.Environmental contaminants are transported over great distances to Arctic ecosystems, where they can accumulate in wildlife. Whether contaminant concentrations in wildlife are sufficient to produce adverse effects remains poorly understood. Exposure to contaminants elevates oxidative stress with possible fitness consequences. The glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), an Arctic top predator, was used as a bioindicator for investigating relationships between contaminant levels (organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyls [OC/<e>PCB</e>], mercury [Hg], and selenium [Se]) and measures of oxidative stress (glutathione [GSH] metabolism and lipid peroxidation) in Canadian Arctic ecosystems. Contaminant levels were low and associations between contaminant exposure and oxidative stress were weak. Nevertheless, glutathione peroxidase activity rose with increasing hepatic Se concentrations, levels of thiols declined as Hg and OC/PCB levels rose, and at one of the two study sites levels of lipid peroxidation were elevated with increasing levels of hepatic Hg. These results suggest the possibility of a deleterious effect of exposure to contaminants on gull physiology even at low contaminant exposures.",M1
20526952,"Natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POP) increase weight gain, advance puberty, and induce changes in gene expression associated with steroid hormones and obesity in female zebrafish.In the present study, developmental and reproductive effects of lifelong exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of two natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POP) were investigated using classical and molecular methods in a controlled zebrafish model. The mixtures used were extracted from burbot (Lota lota) liver originating from freshwater systems in Norway: one mixture with high levels and one mixture with background levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (DDT). The concentration of POP measured in the zebrafish ranged from levels detected in wild fish from Lake Mj√∏sa to concentrations reported in human and wildlife populations, indicating that the experimental fish were exposed to concentrations comparable with wild fish. Phenotypic effects observed in both exposure groups included earlier onset of puberty, increased male/female sex ratio, and differences in body weight at 5 mo of age. Interestingly, genome-wide transcription profiling showed changes in regulation of genes involved in endocrine signaling and growth. The transcriptomics changes include key regulator genes for steroid hormone functions (ncoa3), and growth (c/ebp, ncoa3). The effects observed in the experimental zebrafish model raise the question whether chemical pollution represents a risk to reproductive health of wild fish inhabitating the freshwater system.",M1
20471608,"Flow cytometry-based method for isolating live bacteria with meta-cleavage activity on dihydroxy compounds of biphenyl.A new method for isolating targeted live bacterial cells was established with the use of cell sorting by flow cytometry (FCM) based on the fluorescence of the intermediate metabolite of biphenyl degradation. During biphenyl degradation, a <e>PCB</e> degrader, Comamonas testosteroni TK102, produces a meta-cleavage intermediate metabolite, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA), which emits green fluorescence. HOPDA was produced from 2,3-dihydroxy biphenyl as a substrate, but it was not appropriate for labeling cells because it was released from the cells into the medium. When we used 4-n-butylbiphenyl and 4-n-heptylbiphenyl, we found that the cells produced and accumulated 2,3-dihydroxy intermediate metabolites. By the addition of synthesized 2,3-dihydroxy-4'-butylbiphenyl (2,3-DHBBP), we were able to label the cells with strong green fluorescence, suggesting the persistence of fluorescent intermediate metabolite in the cells by the introduction of the alkyl tail. 2,3-DHBBP was then used to label strain TK102 and the cells were sorted with FCM. The sorting efficiency of FCM was defined as the percentage of colony numbers per sorting events. Strain TK102 cells were successfully enriched by 4.1-fold from the mixture with environmental indigenous bacteria with a sorting efficiency of 7.3%. The method we present here serves as a basic technique for the specific and direct isolation of live bacterial cells which contain dioxygenases active on dihydroxylated aromatic compounds.",M1
20446689,"Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in human adipose tissue samples from southeast China.This paper presents a comprehensive study of polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) levels and homologue profiles in human adipose tissues among residents of Southeast China. A large number of samples (n = 303) were selected for a number of PCB congeners (n = 62) which were analyzed by highly sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The total mean PCB concentrations were 27.2 microg/kg fat (n = 159) in Anhui Province and 17.2 microg/kg fat (n = 144) in Jiangsu Province. A significant correlation was observed between age and PCB levels but not found between gender and PCB levels. The relationship between the environmental contaminant levels and the PCB concentration in adipose tissue was also investigated. It was found that the higher PCB concentrations in human adipose tissue were associated with the higher environmental PCB levels in the corresponding regions. The PCB homologue profiles of the human adipose tissue in China are different from those in the world, similarly to the different PCB homologue pattern between Chinese and global soils. The concept of the urban fractionation effect in the environment may be applicable to explain the PCB homologue profiles and PCB levels in the human adipose tissues collected from different provinces in China. The data presented in this study can provide useful information on human exposures to PCBs in the general population of Southeast China.",M1
20441148,"Dust from U.K. primary school classrooms and daycare centers: the significance of dust as a pathway of exposure of young U.K. children to brominated flame retardants and polychlorinated biphenyls.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A), and polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) were measured in floor dust from U.K. child daycare center and primary school classrooms (n = 43, 36 for PCBs). Concentrations of HBCDs exceeded significantly (p &lt; 0.05) those reported previously for U.K. houses and offices, while those of TBBP-A exceeded significantly those in U.K. cars and offices. PCB concentrations were statistically indistinguishable from those in U.K. house dust but lower than in U.S. classroom dust, while BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153, 196, 197, 203, and 209 in classrooms were significantly below concentrations in U.K. cars. Exposure of young U.K. children via classroom dust exceeds that of U.K. adults via office dust for all contaminants monitored. Overall dust exposure of young U.K. children was estimated including car, classroom, and house dust. Exposure to TBBP-A was well below a U.K. health-based limit value (HBLV). Though no HBLVs exist for non-dioxin-like PCBs and HBCDs; dust exposure to PCBs fell well below U.K. dietary and inhalation exposure. Contrastingly, a high-end estimate of HBCD dust exposure exceeded U.K. dietary exposure substantially. Moreover, high-end estimates of dust exposure to BDE-99 and BDE-209 (4.3 and 13000 ng/kg bw/day, respectively) exceeded HBLVs of 0.23-0.30 and 7000 ng/kg bw/day respectively.",M1
20429583,"Binary mixture effects by PBDE congeners (47, 153, 183, or 209) and <e>PCB</e> congeners (126 or 153) in MCF-7 cells: biochemical alterations assessed by IR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis.Target organisms are continuously and variously exposed to contaminant mixtures in the environment. We noted that treatment with brominated diphenyl ether (BDE)47 or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)126 (toxic equivalency factor [TEF] = 0.1) induces similar alterations in MCF-7 cells when these were determined using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with multivariate analysis. Because this method appears sensitive enough to signature low-dose effects, we examined how various test agents interact in binary mixtures to induce cell alterations. MCF-7 cells were exposed for 24 h to low concentrations (10(-12) M) of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners (47, 153, 183, or 209) with or without the coplanar PCB126 or nonplanar PCB153. Following treatment, ethanol-fixed cellular material was interrogated using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy; derived IR spectra in the biochemical-cell fingerprint region (1800 cm(-1)-900 cm(-1)) were then subjected to principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis. Assuming that if two test agents independently induce the same cell alteration that in combination they'll give rise to an additive effect, we examined predicted versus observed differences in induced alterations by binary mixtures. Compared to corresponding control clusters, treatment with PBDE congener plus PCB126 appeared to cancel out their respective induced alterations. However, treatment with binary mixtures including PCB153 gave rise to an enhanced segregation. Our findings suggest that test agents which mediate their cellular effects via similar mechanisms might result in inhibition within a binary mixture whereas independently acting agents could exacerbate induced alterations in overall cell status.",M1
20426459,"Polychlorinated biphenyls and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-<e>PCBs</e>) in the blood of toothed and baleen whales stranded along Japanese coastal waters.In this study, we determined the residue levels and patterns of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) in the blood from eight species of toothed whales and three species of baleen whales stranded along the Japanese coast during 1999-2007. Penta- through hepta-chlorinated PCB congeners were the dominant homologue groups in all cetaceans. In contrast, specific differences in the distribution of dominant OH-PCB isomers and homologues were found among the cetacean species. In five species of toothed whales (melon-headed whale, Stejneger's beaked whale, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Blainville's beaked whale, and killer whale), the predominant homologues were OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-tetra-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The predominant homologues of finless porpoise and beluga whale were OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-hexa-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The predominant OH-PCB isomers were para-OH-PCBs such as 4OH-CB26, 4'OH-CB25/4'OH-CB26/4OH-CB31, 4OH-CB70, 4'OH-CB72, 4'OH-CB97, 4'OH-CB101/4'OH-CB120, and 4OH-CB107/4'OH-CB108 in toothed whales. In three baleen whales (common minke whale, Bryde's whale, and humpback whale) and in sperm whale (which is a toothed whale), OH-octa-PCB (4OH-CB202) was the predominant homologue group accounting for 40-80% of the total OH-PCB concentrations. The differences in concentrations and profiles of OH-PCBs may suggest species-specific diets, metabolic capability, and the transthyretin (TTR) binding specificity. These results reveal that the accumulation profiles of OH-PCBs in cetacean blood are entirely different from the profiles found in pinnipeds, polar bear, and humans.",M1
20408536,"Elevated body burdens of PBDEs, dioxins, and <e>PCBs</e> on thyroid hormone homeostasis at an electronic waste recycling site in China.A cross-sectional study of 25 sample sets (each set consisted of maternal serum and cord whole blood) from 50 pregnant women in zone A (n = 25 from exposed group) and zone B (n = 25 from reference group) was conducted to examine the association between thyroid hormone (TH) levels and PBDE, PCDD/F, and PCB exposures. Thyroid hormones TT3, TT4, and TSH levels were measured in maternal serum at 16 weeks of gestation. The concentrations of PBDEs, PCDD/Fs, and PCBs were determined by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS in cord blood samples. Body burdens of the three contaminants in cord blood in zone A (median: summation sigma TEQ-PCDD/Fs 0.041, summation operator TEQ-PCBs 0.022 pg WHO-TEQ/g, summation operator PBDEs 23.4 pg/g whole weight, respectively) were significantly higher than those from the reference area (median: summation sigma TEQ-PCDD/Fs 0.014, summation sigma TEQ-PCBs 0.0041 pg WHO-TEQ/g, summation sigma PBDEs 16.15 pg/g, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). Levels of TT4 and TSH in serum in zone A were significantly lower than those in zone B (p &lt; 0.05). A negative correlation was found between TT4 levels and body burdens of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. However, there was no significant association of concentration of PBDEs and levels of the three thyroid hormones. Our results suggest that electronic waste (e-waste) recycling contributes to high body burdens of PBDEs, PCDD/Fs, and PCBs and affects thyroid hormone homeostasis in humans. The potential health risk for neonates still needs further investigation.",M1
20406653,"Polychlorinated biphenyl-induced VCAM-1 expression is attenuated in aortic endothelial cells isolated from caveolin-1 deficient mice.Exposure to environmental contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>), is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is a critical mediator for adhesion and uptake of monocytes across the endothelium in the early stages of atherosclerosis development. The upregulation of VCAM-1 by PCBs may be dependent on functional membrane domains called caveolae. Caveolae are particularly abundant in endothelial cell membranes and involved in trafficking and signal transduction. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of caveolae in PCB-induced endothelial cell dysfunction. Primary mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) isolated from caveolin-1-deficient mice and background C57BL/6 mice were treated with coplanar PCBs, such as PCB77 and PCB126. In addition, siRNA gene silencing technique was used to knockdown caveolin-1 in porcine vascular endothelial cells. In MAECs with functional caveolae, VCAM-1 protein levels were increased after exposure to both coplanar PCBs, whereas expression levels of VCAM-1 were not significantly altered in cells deficient of caveolin-1. Furthermore, PCB-induced monocyte adhesion was attenuated in caveolin-1-deficient MAECs. Similarly, siRNA silencing of caveolin-1 in porcine endothelial cells confirmed the caveolin-1-dependent VCAM-1 expression. Treatment of cells with PCB77 and PCB126 resulted in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), and pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 diminished the observed PCB-induced increase in monocyte adhesion. These findings suggest that coplanar PCBs induce adhesion molecule expression, such as VCAM-1, in endothelial cells, and that this response is regulated by caveolin-1 and functional caveolae. Our data demonstrate a critical role of functional caveolae in the activation and dysfunction of endothelial cells by coplanar PCBs.",M1
20394812,"<e>PCB</e>-153 exposure coordinates cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism in human mammary epithelial cells.2,2',4,4',5,5'-Hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) is a non-metabolizable environmental chemical contaminant commonly found in breast milk of PCB exposed individuals, suggesting that chronic exposure to PCB-153 could have adverse health effects. We have shown previously that PCB-153 increased reactive oxygen species levels in non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells, which were associated with DNA damage, growth inhibition, and cytotoxicity. This study investigates the hypothesis that PCB-153 exposure coordinates cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism by inhibiting cyclin D1 accumulation. PCB-153 treated MCF-10A cells exhibited a dose and time dependent decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels. The decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels was associated with an inhibition in AKT and GSK-3beta phosphorylation, which correlated with an increase in cyclin D1-T286 phosphorylation. Fibroblasts carrying a mutant form of cyclin D1 (T286A) were resistant to PCB-153 induced degradation of cyclin D1. Pre-treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) suppressed PCB-153 induced decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels. Interestingly, suppression in cyclin D1 accumulation was associated with an increase in cellular glucose consumption, and hexokinase II and pyruvate kinase protein levels. These results suggest that cyclin D1 coordinates cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism in PCB-153 treated non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells.",M1
20392087,"Biogeochemical controls on <e>PCB</e> deposition in Hudson Bay.PCB concentrations, congener patterns, and fluxes were examined in 13 dated and organically characterized (C, N, delta(13)C, delta(15)N) marine sediment cores from Hudson Bay, Canada, to investigate the importance of organic matter (OM) supply and transport to PCB sequestration. Drawdown of PCBs, supported by marine primary production, is reflected in elevated summation operatorPCB concentrations and more highly chlorinated PCB signatures in surface sediments underlying eutrophic regions. Sediments in oligotrophic regions, which are dominated by  old  marine OM, have lower PCB concentrations and weathered signatures. For the surface of Hudson Bay, average atmospheric deposition appears to be very low (ca. 1.4 pg summation operatorPCBs cm(-2) a(-1)) compared to fluxes reported for nearby lakes (ca. 44 pg summation operatorPCBs cm(-2) a(-1)). (210)Pb fails to provide a means to normalize the fluxes, highlighting important differences in the biocycling of (210)Pb and PCBs. Unlike (210)Pb, atmospheric PCB exchange with the water's surface is partially forced by the aquatic organic carbon cycle. The extremely low atmospheric deposition of PCBs to the surface of Hudson Bay is likely a reflection of the Bay's exceptionally low productivity and vertical carbon fluxes. If future marine production and vertical flux of carbon increase due to loss of ice cover or change in river input as consequences of global warming, PCB deposition would also increase.",M1
20390877,"Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies for predicting activation of the ryanodine receptor type 1 channel complex (RyR1) by polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) congeners.A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was developed to predict the congener specific ryanodine receptor type RyR1 activity of all 209 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. A three-variable QSAR equation was obtained via stepwise forward linear regression on an unsupervised forward selection reduced data set from an initial database. Application of the QSAR towards predicting EC(2x) values for all 209 PCB congeners indicated good agreement in substitution pattern trends between the experimental and estimated data sets. The QSAR model predicts a less than two-fold increase in maximal potency among all congeners outside the experimental database, and it appears that no high-potency PCB congeners with EC(2x) values much less than 0.2 microM exist. Increasing RyR1-neuro toxicity equivalents with increasing homologue number and Aroclor chlorination likely reflect indirect molecular controls on toxicity, since congeners with multiple ortho substituents-the primary structural feature controlling a lack of coplanarity and resulting neurotoxicity-are more likely to be found in higher homologues.",M1
20390860,"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls in farmed fish, water, sediment, and feed.This investigation was undertaken to determine the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dizenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-<e>PCBs</e>) in farmed grouper tissues and environmental medium samples, including sediment, water, and feed. The water concentrations of DL-PCBs were low at 4.33-7.63 pg/L, and those of PCDD/Fs were 0.399-0.794 pg/L. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs in sediment samples were 21.4-35.3 pg/g, and those of PCBs were 54.7-100 pg/g. To identify changes in PCDD/Fs and PCBs levels in fish throughout growth, the tissue samples from hatchlings, 2-month, 15-month, 24-month, and 36-month-old orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) were analyzed. In grouper tissue samples, the total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) of the total PCBs were 0.129-0.745 pg World Health Organization- toxicity equivalent (WHO-TEQ/g) wet weight (w.w.), while total PCDD/Fs TEQ were 0.022-0.073 pg WHO-TEQ/g w.w The DL-PCBs were contributed more to the TEQ than PCDD/Fs in all fish tissue samples. Both PCDD/F and DL-PCB concentrations increase as grouper age increased. Results of this study demonstrate that PCDD/Fs and PCBs accumulate in fish tissues, and diet is the main source of PCDD/Fs and PCBs accumulations.",M1
20385405,"A comparison of <e>PCB</e> bioaccumulation factors between an arctic and a temperate marine food web.To test how environmental conditions in the Arctic and the resulting ecological adaptations affect accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the marine food web, bioaccumulation of four polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in an arctic (Barents Sea 77 degrees N-82 degrees N) and a temperate marine (Baltic Sea 54 degrees N-62 degrees N) food web were compared. Three different trophic levels were studied (zooplankton, fish, and seal), representing the span from first-level consumer to top predator. Previously published high-quality data on PCB water concentrations in the two areas were used for calculation of bioaccumulation factors (BAF). BAF was calculated as the ratio of the PCB concentration in the organism ([PCB](org); pg/kg lipid) to the dissolved water concentration (C(w); pg/L). The BAF(Arctic):BAF(Temperate) ratios were above 1 for all four PCB congeners in zooplankton (6.4-13.8) and planktivorous fish (2.9-5.0)), whereas the ratios were below 1 in seal. The mean ratio between arctic and temperate BAFs for all trophic levels and congeners (BAF(Arcti):BAF(Temperate)) was 4.8. When the data were corrected for the seawater temperature difference between the two ecosystems, the ratio was 2.0. We conclude that bioaccumulation differences caused by ecological or physiological adaptations of organisms between the two ecosystems were well within a water concentration variability of 50%. Further, our data support the hypothesis that lower seawater temperature lead to a thermodynamically favoured passive partitioning to organic matrices and thus elevated ambient BAFs in the Arctic compared to the Baltic Sea. This would imply that bioaccumulation in the Arctic may be described in the same way as bioaccumulation in temperate regions, e.g. by the use of mechanistic models parameterised for the Arctic.",M1
20384381,"Determination and characterization of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-<e>PCBs</e>) in serum and adipose tissue of Japanese women diagnosed with breast cancer.In the present study, we analyze and characterize the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in serum and breast adipose tissue, and measure TH (total 3,5,5'-triiodothyronine (tT3) and total l-thyroxine (tT4)) levels in serum of Japanese women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 51) to know how PCBs affect thyroid hormone homeostasis. Concentrations of Sigma(90)OH-PCBs in serum and adipose tissues were 630 pg g(-1) serum wet wt. and 140 pg/ g(-1) lipid wt., respectively, and the levels of OH-PCBs in adipose tissues were 4-5 times lower than in serum. The tT3 and tT4 concentrations in serum (n = 20) were 1.3 ng g(-1) serum wet wt. and 62 ng g(-1) serum wet wt., respectively. Among all the OH-PCBs, 4'-OH-CB101/120, 4-OH-CB107/4'-OH-CB108, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB146, 3-OH-CB153, 4'-OH-CB172, and 4-OH-CB187 were the dominant isomers in serum. No significant correlation between the concentrations of the TH and OH-PCBs in serum was observed (p &gt; 0.05). The results indicated that the relationship between the OH-PCB levels and the thyroid hormone markers was rare. From analysis of two kinds of human biological samples, it was estimated that OH-PCBs have little effect on thyroid hormone homeostasis.",M1
20384380,"Serum <e>PCB</e> concentrations and cochlear function in 12-year-old children.Experimental evidence from animals indicates that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes deterioration of the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea. To test this hypothesis in humans, we measured serum PCB concentrations in 574 12-year-old children residing in three districts in the Slovak Republic using high-resolution gas chromatography with microelectron capture detection. As a marker of cochlear status, we measured transient evoked (TE) and distortion product (DP) otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and assessed the cross-sectional association between serum PCBs and OAEs. Median total PCB concentrations were 352.8, 150.5, and 134.9 ng/g lipid in Michalovce, Svidnik, and Bratislava, respectively. In multivariate regression models where otoacoustic measures were modeled as a function of log (base 10) PCB concentrations with adjustment for gender, age, and site of examination, dioxin-like PCBs, nondioxin-like PCBs and a PCB grouping targeting upregulation of hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase were significantly associated with lower TEOAE powers at 1000 and 1500 Hz. At 1500 Hz, we observed a strong association with sum of PCBs and DL-PCBs, in the left ear only. The DPOAEs at 1000 Hz were associated with all four PCB groupings. The results of this study show that PCBs may affect the OHCs of the cochlea, a result consistent with findings from animal studies published to date.",M1
20384379,"Distribution of <e>PCBs</e>, their hydroxylated metabolites, and other phenolic contaminants in human serum from two European countries.Human exposure to mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may result in the formation of different profiles of hydroxylated PCBs (HO-PCBs), as a consequence of different exposures or dissimilar metabolism of parent compounds. Therefore, we investigated the levels and profiles of PCBs and HO-PCBs in human serum samples collected from two European countries with different degrees of pollution. There was no significant difference between the levels of sum PCBs measured in each set of samples, with a median concentration of 3100 pg/mL for Romanian samples (n = 53) and 3380 pg/mL for Belgian samples (n = 22). However, the median concentrations recorded for sum HO-PCBs were almost double in Belgian (310 pg/mL) compared to Romanian (175 pg/mL) samples. The detection frequency recorded for HO-PCBs in Belgian samples was also significantly higher compared to Romanian samples. The main contributors to the sum HO-PCBs in the Belgian samples were 4HO-CB107 &gt; 4HO-CB146 &gt; 4HO-CB187 (76% from the sum HO-PCBs) and 4HO-CB187 &gt; 4HO-CB146 &gt; 3'HO-CB138 (66% from the sum of HO-PCBs) in the Romanian samples. The HO-PCB profile showed that the higher chlorinated HO-PCBs had a higher contribution in the Romanian samples compared to the Belgian ones. This suggests that differences in the PCB profiles between populations can lead to the formation of different HO-PCB metabolite profiles presenting thus different risks for populations. No clear preferential mechanism of HO-PCB metabolite formation (HO-direct insertion vs. 1,2-shift of a chlorine atom) could be highlighted for investigated samples. The main chlorinated phenolic compound found in the Belgian samples was pentachlorophenol (PCP) which accounted for up to 85% of the total quantified phenolics, whereas in the Romanian samples, PCP accounted for only 35%.",M1
20384378,"Current exposure to persistent polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) of Belgian students from food and dust.Human exposure to individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) through food (duplicate diets) and indoor dust ingestion was assessed for 19 Belgian students. The serum concentrations of the persistent PCB congeners in serum (PCB 118, 138, 153, 170, and 180) have been correlated with the individual intake through food and dust. Dietary intakes of SigmaPCBs ranged between 40 and 204 ng/day (median 133). PCB exposure through dust ingestion ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ng/day (median 0.3) or 0.3 and 1.7 ng/day (median 0.8), assuming average dust ingestion (20 mg/day) and high dust ingestion rates (50 mg/day), respectively. Dietary intake of p,p'-DDE was comparable to that of PCBs with a range from 21 to 214 ng/day (median 92). The exposure to p,p'-DDE via dust ingestion ranged between 0.02 and 0.43 ng/day (median 0.17) or 0.05 and 1.09 ng/day (median 0.43), assuming average and high dust ingestion rates, respectively. Concentrations measured in blood serum were 28-153 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (median 74) and 32-264 ng/g lw (median 45) for SigmaPCBs and p,p'-DDE, respectively. Serum concentrations in the studied population are slightly lower compared to other European populations. In spite of the uncertainty associated with the dust ingestion rates, food was the predominant exposure pathway for each PCB congener and for p,p'-DDE in the studied population. Food intake contributed more than 99% of the combined PCB intake from food and dust. No significant positive correlations (p &gt; 0.05) were observed between the serum concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE and the total intake through food and dust for each participant. Instead, it is hypothesized that past and episodic higher current intakes are more important determinants of body burden than continuous background exposures at low levels.",M1
20384377,"Measurement and modeling of polychlorinated biphenyl bioaccumulation from sediment for the marine polychaete Neanthes arenaceodentata and response to sorbent amendment.Bioaccumulation rates of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) for the marine polychaete Neanthes arenaceodentata were characterized, including PCB uptake rates from water and sediment, and the effect of sorbent amendment to the sediment on PCB bioavailability, organism growth, and lipid content. Physiological parameters were incorporated into a biodynamic model to predict contaminant uptake. The results indicate rapid PCB uptake from contaminated sediment and significant organism growth dilution during time-series exposure studies. PCB uptake from the aqueous phase accounted for less than 3% of the total uptake for this deposit-feeder. Proportional increase of gut residence time and assimilation efficiency as a consequence of the organism's growth was assessed by PCB uptake and a reactor theory model of gut architecture. Pulse-chase feeding and multilabeled stable isotope tracing techniques proved high sediment ingestion rates (i.e., 6-10 times of dry body weight per day) indicating that such deposit-feeders are promising biological indicators for sediment risk assessment. Activated carbon amendment reduced PCB uptake by 95% in laboratory experiments with no observed adverse growth effects on the marine polychaete. Biodynamic modeling explained the observed PCB body burdens for N. arenaceodentata, with and without sorbent amendment.",M1
20384376,"Clearance of polychlorinated biphenyl atropisomers is enantioselective in female C57Bl/6 mice.Changes in the enantiomeric composition of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) can not only be used to investigate environmental and biological transport processes, but also have human health implications because of enantiospecific adverse health effects. To further understand differences in the disposition of PCB atropisomers in vivo, the present study investigates the toxicokinetics of PCB atropisomers in female C57Bl/6 mice after oral administration of a mixture of several PCBs, including racemic PCBs 91, 95, 132, 136, 149, 174, and 176. On the Chirasil-Dex column, an enrichment of the second eluting atropisomers was generally observed, whereas only the first eluting atropisomers E1-PCB 95, (-)-PCB 132, and (-)-PCB 149 had half-lives that were distinctively longer compared to the second eluting atropisomers. The bioavailability normalized clearance of first eluting atropisomers in blood was faster compared to that of second eluting atropisomers. The opposite trend was observed for the accumulation factors in adipose tissue, which is consistent with the slower clearance of the first eluting atropisomer. The only exception was PCB 174, which showed no differences in the toxicokinetic parameters of both atropisomers. Together, the differences in the toxicokinetics of PCB atropisomers point toward enantioselective biotransformation processes as the origin of PCB's enantiomeric enrichment in mammals and, possibly, humans.",M1
20384375,"Evidence for unique and ubiquitous environmental sources of 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl (<e>PCB</e> 11).The non-Aroclor congener 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 11) has been recently detected in air, water, biota, sediment, and suspended sediment. Although it has been known since at least the 1970s that this congener is produced inadvertently during the production of diarylide yellow pigments, this work presents the first evidence that the use of these pigments in consumer goods results in the dispersion of PCB 11 throughout the environment at levels that are problematic in terms of achieving water quality standards for the sum of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this work, PCB 11 is measured at ppb levels in consumer goods that are likely to be discarded in ways that allow them to enter wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflows, including newspapers, magazines, cardboard boxes used for food packaging, and plastic bags. Also, using data sets acquired for the purpose of calculating total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for PCBs, PCB 11 loads to the New York/New Jersey Harbor and Delaware River are calculated. Despite the fact that there are no known manufacturers of diarylide yellow pigments in the Delaware River watershed, the loads of PCB 11 to the Delaware River exceed the TMDL for the sum of PCBs by nearly a factor of 2. The ratio of PCB 11 to a characteristic dechlorination end product, PCB 4 (2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl), in these data sets indicates that dechlorination is not a significant source of PCB 11 in these systems. In the upper Hudson River, where extensive dechlorination of heavy PCB congeners occurs, the ratio is just 0.012. In contrast, downstream in the NY/NJ Harbor as well as in the Delaware River the ratio is much higher and more variable. Pigment use therefore appears to be the main source of PCB 11 in these systems, and this congener is likely to present a significant obstacle to achieving PCB water quality standards throughout the United States.",M1
20384374,"Spatial distribution of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls in Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois.Passive samplers were deployed across Cleveland, OH and Chicago, IL to evaluate the spatial variability of airborne <e>PCBs</e> in urban areas. We measured SigmaPCB concentrations, the sum of 151 congeners or congener groups quantified using tandem mass spectrometry, spatial distributions, and congener profiles in two urban areas in the Great Lakes region. Mean SigmaPCB concentrations were significantly different between Cleveland (1.73 +/- 1.16 ng m(-3)) and Chicago (1.13 +/- 0.58 ng m(-3)) during the August 2008 sampling period. Mean congener profiles were compared with commercial Aroclor mixtures and found to be similar to Aroclor 1242 in Cleveland and similar to a mixture of 1242 and 1254 in Chicago. We observed large spatial variation in concentrations and weak or no significant autocorrelation between sites in both cities.  Hot spots  of high SigmaPCB concentrations were identified in both urban areas and the congener profiles at these locations were most strongly correlated to that of PCB Aroclor mixtures. Congener profiles showed important differences including the enrichment of dioxin-like congeners in Chicago.",M1
20384373,"Polychlorinated biphenyls in global air and surface soil: distributions, air-soil exchange, and fractionation effect.Polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) concentrations in air and soil, measured by various research groups from around the world, were compiled and analyzed. Data for air were available from most regions, particularly in Europe and Asia. The average air concentrations (pg/m(3)) for SigmaPCB at background sites were 70 (5.1-170) for Europe, 79 (49-120) for North America, 66 (18-110) for South America, 270 (9-670) for Central America, 59 (17-150) for Asia, and 15 (13-17) for Australia. Data for soils exhibited better global coverage compared to air and were available from most regions. The average soil concentrations (pg/g dry weight) for SigmaPCB at background sites were 7500 (47-97 000) for Europe, 4300 (110-25 000) for North America, 1400 (61-9 500) for South America, 580 (120-2 900) for Asia, 390 (94-620) for Africa, and 280 (140-540) for Australia. Based on available studies where coupled measurements of PCBs in air and soil were made, the equilibrium status of PCBs in the air-soil system was investigated for China, West Midlands of the UK, central and southern Europe, and along a latitudinal transect from the south of the UK to the north of Norway. Differences were observed in plots of the soil-air equilibrium status (expressed as the soil-air fugacity fraction, ff) for different PCB homologues. This was explained by varying contributions from primary and secondary emissions-spatially and temporally. The net effect after several decades of PCB emissions to air, preferential transport of lower molecular weight PCBs through primary and secondary emission, and reductions in emissions to air in recent decades is that the lower molecular weight PCBs have achieved (and in some cases exceeded) soil-air equilibrium in many parts of the world. The exception is remote and background sites that are still dominated by primary sources.",M1
20384372,"Phytoremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls: new trends and promises.Transgenic plants and associated bacteria constitute a new generation of genetically modified organisms for efficient and environment-friendly treatment of soil and water contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>). This review focuses on recent advances in phytoremediation for the treatment of PCBs, including the development of transgenic plants and associated bacteria. Phytoremediation, or the use of higher plants for rehabilitation of soil and groundwater, is a promising strategy for cost-effective treatment of sites contaminated by toxic compounds, including PCBs. Plants can help mitigate environmental pollution by PCBs through a range of mechanisms: besides uptake from soil (phytoextraction), plants are capable of enzymatic transformation of PCBs (phytotransformation); by releasing a variety of secondary metabolites, plants also enhance the microbial activity in the root zone, improving biodegradation of PCBs (rhizoremediation). However, because of their hydrophobicity and chemical stability, PCBs are only slowly taken up and degraded by plants and associated bacteria, resulting in incomplete treatment and potential release of toxic metabolites into the environment. Moreover, naturally occurring plant-associated bacteria may not possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for PCB degradation. To overcome these limitations, bacterial genes involved in the metabolism of PCBs, such as biphenyl dioxygenases, have been introduced into higher plants, following a strategy similar to the development of transgenic crops. Similarly, bacteria have been genetically modified that exhibit improved biodegradation capabilities and are able to maintain stable relationships with plants. Transgenic plants and associated bacteria bring hope for a broader and more efficient application of phytoremediation for the treatment of PCBs.",M1
20384371,"Chiral polychlorinated biphenyl transport, metabolism, and distribution: a review.Chirality can be exploited to gain insight into enantioselective fate processes that may otherwise remain undetected because only biological, but not physical and chemical transport and transformation processes in an achiral environment will change enantiomer compositions. This review provides an in-depth overview of the application of chirality to the study of chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>), an important group of legacy pollutants. Like other chiral compounds, individual PCB enantiomers may interact enantioselectively (or enantiospecifically) with chiral macromolecules, such as cytochrome P-450 enzymes or ryanodine receptors, leading to differences in their toxicological effects and the enantioselective formation of chiral biotransformation products. Species and congener-specific enantiomer enrichment has been demonstrated in environmental compartments, wildlife, and mammals, including humans, typically due to a complex combination of biotransformation processes and uptake via the diet by passive diffusion. Changes in the enantiomer composition of chiral PCBs in the environment have been used to understand complex aerobic and anaerobic microbial transformation pathways, to delineate and quantify PCB sources and transport in the environment, to gain insight into the biotransformation of PCBs in aquatic food webs, and to investigate the enantioselective disposition of PCBs and their methylsulfonyl PCBs metabolites in rodents. Overall, changes in chiral signatures are powerful, but currently underutilized tools for studies of environmental and biological processes of PCBs.",M1

20383374,"Western Mediterranean coastal waters--monitoring <e>PCBs</e> and pesticides accumulation in Mytilus galloprovincialis by active mussel watching: the Mytilos project.In order to evaluate the contamination levels in the Western Mediterranean basin, the active mussel watch methodology has been applied. This methodology consists of mussel transplantation (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from non impacted areas to selected coastal areas, characterised by potential impact from the continent due to contaminating sources. The areas of interest were selected along the entire coastal development of the Western Mediterranean sea, 122 sites in total. The time of mussel caging exposure was 12 weeks. The project was co-financed in the frame of the Interreg IIIB Meddoc Programme, aimed at determining the overall chemical quality of the Mediterranean sea, consistent with the Water Framework Directive 2000/60. Several partners representative of the coastal Mediterranean Countries were involved in the Project, with the purpose of building up a common surveillance network, adopting shared methodologies. In this paper we present the results of three yearly monitoring campaigns (2004, 2005, 2006) carried out along the coasts of Italy, France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, including the coastal environment of Baleares, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. The contamination levels of Pesticides (DDT and its metabolites, Hexachlorocyclohexane isomers alpha and gamma) and Polychlorinated biphenyls, are reported and discussed. Statistical elaborations performed on the original data set were mainly aimed at validating the raw sample distributions, by means of the Johnson method. Both DD and PCB species frequency distributions have been approximated to appropriate theoretical distributions, belonging to the Log-normal and Bounded families. By integrating the related Probability Density Functions (p.d.f.), different accumulation values for DDT, DDD and DDE and PCB species have been estimated, corresponding to fixed percentage points of the area under the respective curves. By choosing appropriate probability level boundaries (33rd and 66th percentile), different regional zones have been ranked in terms of low, medium and high accumulation for Pesticides and PCBs.",M1
20383364,"Spatial distribution and partitioning of polychlorinated biphenyls in Tokyo Bay, Japan.Spatial distributions and partitioning of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) in Tokyo Bay, Japan, were evaluated by measuring the concentrations of all 209 PCB congeners in surface and bottom waters and bottom sediment at 10 locations. The dissolved + particulate summed congener concentrations (SigmaPCB [sum of the concentrations of all 209 PCB congeners]) in surface and bottom waters ranged from 120 to 1100 pg L(-1) (median 250 pg L(-1)) and from 83 to 910 pg L(-1) (median 230 pg L(-1)), respectively. The concentrations did not statistically differ between the two layers, possibly because of vertical mixing of the water column. SigmaPCB concentrations in sediment ranged from 2.7 to 110 ng g(-1)-dry weight. The highest SigmaPCB concentrations in both water and sediment were found at stations in the northern bay. Logarithms of field-observed organic carbon-normalized partition coefficients (K(OC)) increased linearly as the log octanol-water partition coefficients (K(OW)) increased, up to a log K(OW) of about 6.5, and then decreased for log K(OW) &gt; 6.5 (mostly hexa- and hepta-chlorinated biphenyls). Furthermore, log K(OC) values of congeners having log K(OW) &lt; 6.5 were higher by about 1 than values predicted by a published empirically derived equation, suggesting that application of K(OC) values determined in laboratory experiments with soil or sediment samples to fate prediction models may result in overestimation by about one order of magnitude of the concentrations of PCBs with log K(OW) &lt; 6.5 in the dissolved phase in the water column.",M1
20378105,"A cohort study of developmental polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) exposure in relation to post-vaccination antibody response at 6-months of age.BACKGROUND: Extensive experimental data in animals indicate that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during pregnancy leads to changes in offspring immune function during the postnatal period. Whether developmental PCB exposure influences immunologic development in humans has received little study. METHODS: The study population was 384 mother-infant pairs recruited from two districts of eastern Slovakia for whom prospectively collected maternal, cord, and 6-month infant blood specimens were available. Several PCB congeners were measured in maternal, cord, and 6-month infant sera by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Concentrations of IgG-specific anti-haemophilus influenzae type b, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria toxoid were assayed in 6-month infant sera using ELISA methods. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the relation between maternal, cord, and 6-month infant PCB concentrations and the antibody concentrations evaluated at 6-months of age. RESULTS: Overall, there was little evidence of an association between infant antibody concentrations and PCB measures during the pre- and early postnatal period. In addition, our results did not show specificity in terms of associations limited to a particular developmental period (e.g. pre- vs. postnatal), a particular antibody, or a particular PCB congener. CONCLUSIONS: At the PCB concentrations measured in this cohort, which are high relative to most human populations today, we did not detect an association between maternal or early postnatal PCB exposure and specific antibody responses at 6-months of age.",M1
20377311,"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) and male reproduction.Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of persistent organic pollutants that were widely used in the mid-20th century. Though their production and use was banned by most countries several decades ago, the general population continues to be exposed due to the persistence and bioaccumulation of PCBs. A number of human epidemiological studies have assessed the relationship between environmental PCB exposure and markers of male reproductive health, namely semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, and morphology), sperm DNA integrity (DNA damage or chromatin fragmentation), and circulating reproductive hormone levels. Despite a wide range of study designs and locations, measurement methods, and PCB exposure levels, reports of inverse associations between PCBs and sperm motility have been consistent which may suggest a lack of exposure threshold for a PCB-related effect on sperm motility. Several studies have also reported inverse associations between PCBs and circulating testosterone levels in men, though the specific form of testosterone (i.e. total, bound, or free testosterone) associated with exposure has not been fully consistent between studies. In conclusion, although PCBs are no longer used and can be considered a legacy chemical, concerns regarding altered male fertility in relation to PCBs remain due to the existing human data demonstrating inverse associations with markers of male reproductive function coupled with recent evidence for continued population exposure.",M1
20362323,"Maternal transfer of chlorinated contaminants in the leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, nesting in French Guiana.We examined the maternal transfer of organochlorine contaminants (OCs), pesticides (DDTS and HCHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>), and the temporal variation of blood and eggs concentrations from 38 leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting in French Guiana. PCBs were found to be the dominant OCs with respective mean concentrations of 55.14 ng g(-1) lipid-mass for egg and 1.26 ng mL(-1) wet-mass for blood. OC concentrations were lower than concentrations measured in other marine turtles which might be due to the lower trophic position (diet based on gelatinous zooplankton) and to the location of their foraging and nesting grounds. All OCs detected in leatherback blood were detected in eggs, suggesting a maternal transfer of OCs. This transfer was shown to depend on female blood concentration for SigmaDDTs and for the most prevalent PCB congeners, since significant relationships were found between paired blood-egg concentrations. During the nesting season, OC concentrations in eggs and the percentage of lipid in eggs were found to decline in successive clutches, highlighting a process of offloading from females to their eggs and a decreasing investment of lipid from females into their clutches. OCs in eggs tended to be higher in females spending 3 years in the foraging grounds between two nesting seasons than in those spending 2 years, suggesting an impact of time spacing two breeding seasons, called remigration interval, and of location of the foraging grounds.",M1
20359995,"<e>PCBs</e> in school-persistent chemicals, persistent problems.The issue of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) exposures resulting from occupancy of PCB-contaminated buildings is not new, but the contribution of building materials to that contamination is largely unrecognized. A rapidly emerging base of evidence shows that PCBs can be widely found in caulking and paint in masonry buildings constructed or renovated from about 1950 to the late 1970s. These materials can cause extensive PCB contamination of the building interiors and surrounding soil, and people who teach, live, or attend school in these buildings can have elevated serum PCB levels. The potential risk associated with this source of PCB exposure is not known; however, it is worth noting that the specific PCB congeners found at high levels in the building environments, and in biological samples from the occupants, include some that are suspected of being potent neurotoxins. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to address this issue in schools; however, the costs of remediating contaminated buildings will pose a formidable obstacle to most school districts.",M1

Previous investigations from e.g. Sweden and The Netherlands have shown some obvious differences in contaminant concentrations, including e.g. hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (OH-<e>PCBs</e>) in guillemot (Uria aalge) and other bird species. Eggs from seven marine bird species, Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), common eider (Somateria mollissima), guillemot, fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), great black-backed gull (Larus marinus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), and great skua (Stercorarius skua), that all breed in Iceland, were collected and analyzed for several persistent organic compounds and their metabolites. The contaminant levels varied between the species investigated. The highest concentrations were found in eggs from the great skua (18 and 23 microg/g l.w. of CB-153 and 4,4'-DDE, respectively). The concentration difference was generally 2 orders of magnitude higher in great skua for all organochlorine compounds analyzed with the exception of HCB. HCB did not vary as much between the seven species (ranging from 34 to 710 ng/g l.w). OH-PCB and MeSO(2)-PCB metabolites congener concentrations and patterns showed differences in metabolic capacity between bird species. Guillemot and great skua seem to distinguish themselves most from other species i.e. with the absence of 4-OH-CB187 and low relative levels of 4-OH-CB146 in guillemot and the low abundance of OH-PCBs in great skua.",M1

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 72 participants aged 15-74 years; subjects were not occupationally exposed to PBDEs or dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-<e>PCBs</e>). Participants lived in two urban areas and two fishing villages. Twenty-seven PBDE congeners, PCB-126, PCB-118, PCB-156, and biochemical factors were determined in fasting blood. A questionnaire survey on life-style was also conducted. RESULTS: More than half of the PBDE values for 14 congeners were below the levels of detection (LODs). The median concentration of total PBDEs was 3.6 ng g(-1) lipid. The most abundant congener was BDE-209 (median concentration, 0.90 ng g(-1) lipid), followed by BDE-153, BDE-207, and BDE-47 in the given order. Most PBDE congeners with &lt; or = 6 bromine atoms had significant positive associations with the concentrations of the three DL-PCBs (suggesting common routes of exposure) and with plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), biological markers of fish intake. These associations did not change substantially after adjustment for age, sex, and log(body mass index). These positive associations with the concentrations of DL-PCBs or EPA/DHA were not found in analyses of high-brominated PBDE congeners with &gt; or = 8 bromine atoms. CONCLUSIONS: Fish consumption may be a major contributor to the accumulation of PBDE congeners with 6 bromine atoms among the general Japanese population. In contrast, the main exposure routes to high-brominated PBDEs in humans are probably not associated with fish consumption.",M1
20345174,"In vitro assay shows that <e>PCB</e> metabolites completely saturate thyroid hormone transport capacity in blood of wild polar bears (Ursus maritimus).Persistent chemicals accumulate in the arctic environment due to their chemical reactivity and physicochemical properties and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are the most concentrated pollutant class in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Metabolism of PCB and polybrominated biphenyl ether (PBDE) flame-retardants alter their toxicological properties and these metabolites are known to interfere with the binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to transthyretin (TTR) in rodents and humans. In polar bear plasma samples no binding of [125I]-T(4) to TTR was observed after incubation and PAGE separation. Incubation of the plasma samples with [14C]-4-OH-CB107, a compound with a higher binding affinity to TTR than the endogenous ligand T(4) resulted in competitive binding as proven by the appearance of a radio labeled TTR peak in the gel. Plasma incubation with T(4) up to 1 mM, a concentration that is not physiologically relevant anymore did not result in any visible competition. These results give evidence that the binding sites on TTR for T(4) in wild living polar bears are completely saturated. Such saturation of binding sites can explain observed lowered levels of THs and could lead to contaminant transport into the developing fetus.",M1

The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were in the range of 0.24-27.49 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) (average value: 3.01 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1)) and 0.015-0.99 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) (average value: 0.33 WHO-TEQ kg(-1)), respectively. For most sediment samples, the pollution levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs exceeded the interim sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The highest level of PCDD/F contamination was found at the Tai'an reach of the Liaohe River, whereas the highest level of PCB contamination was found at the Xinmin reach of the Liaohe River. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data set of sediment samples and to source-related samples from the literature. The results suggested that, PCDD/F contamination in most sediments of the middle and lower reaches of the Daliao River should mainly originated from the local combustion processes, including coal burning, agricultural straw open burning, iron ore sintering, cement production and secondary Al and Cu metallurgy.

Mechanisms involved.Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) during pregnancy and lactation leads to cognitive impairment and motor disorders in children by mechanisms which remain unknown. It also remains unclear whether different non-dioxin-like PCBs have similar or different mechanisms of neurotoxicity. The main aims of this work were: (1) to assess whether developmental exposure to non-dioxin-like-PCBs 52, 138 or 180 affect cognitive function or motor coordination in 3-4 months-old rats; (2) to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Female rats were treated with PCBs (1 mg/kg day) in food from gestational-day 7 to postnatal-day 21. The ability to learn a Y maze conditional discrimination task was reduced in rats exposed to PCBs 138 or 180, but not in rats exposed to PCB52. The function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway (NMDA-induced increase in extracellular cGMP) in cerebellum in vivo was reduced by 33-59% in rats exposed to PCBs 138 or 180, but not by PCB52. The amount of NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors was reduced by 41-49% in rats exposed to PCBs 138 or 180, but not by PCB 52. PCB52 but not 138 or 180 increases extracellular GABA in cerebellum and impairs motor coordination. The effects were similar in males and females. Developmental exposure to different non-dioxin-like PCBs induces different behavioural alterations by different mechanisms. PCB52 impairs motor coordination but not learning while PCB138 or 180 impair learning but not motor coordination. These data are consistent with the following possible mechanisms: (1) developmental exposure to PCBs 138 or 180 reduces the amount of NMDA receptors in cerebellum, which would contribute to reduced function of the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway, which, in turn, would be a main contributor to the impairment of the ability to learn the Y maze task. (2) Developmental exposure to PCB52 increases extracellular GABA in cerebellum, which would contribute to motor coordination impairment.",M1
20222536,"Interfacial and mechanical property analysis of waste printed circuit boards subject to thermal shock.Waste printed circuit boards (<e>PCBs</e>) are the focal points for handling electric and electronic waste. In this paper, a thermal shock method was used to pretreat waste PCBs for the improvement of crushing performance. The influence of the thermal shock process on interfacial modification and mechanical property attenuation of PCB waste was studied. The appearance and layer spacing of the basal plane began to change slightly when the temperature reached 200 degrees C. By 250 degrees C, apparent bulging, cracking, and delamination were observed. However, pyrolysis of PCBs occurred when the temperature reached 275 degrees C, where PCBs were carbonized. The thermogravimetric analysis of PCB particles under vacuum showed that 270 degrees C was the starting point of pyrolysis. The tensile and impact strength of PCBs were reduced as shock temperature rose gradually, with a reduction by 2.6 and 16.5%, respectively, at 250 degrees C from its unheated strength. The PCBs that were heated to 250 degrees C achieved 100% liberation, increasing linearly from 13.6% for unheated PCBs through a single-level shear-crusher (2-mm mesh) and resulting in an obvious reduction of 9.5% (dB) in dust and noise at 250 degrees C. These parameters could be helpful for establishing the operational setup for industrial-scale facilities with the aim of achieving a compact process and a highly efficient recovery for waste PCBs compared with those of the traditional combination mechanical technologies.",M1

To understand the geographic variability and the influence of seabird trophic ecology in OC levels, we analyzed PCBs, DDTs, delta(13)C, and delta(15)N in the blood of adult Calonectris shearwaters throughout a vast geographic range within the northeast Atlantic Ocean (from Cape Verde to Azores) and the Mediterranean Sea (from the Alboran Sea to Crete). OC concentrations were greater in birds from the Mediterranean than in those from the Atlantic colonies, showing higher and lower chlorinated PCB profiles, respectively. This large-scale pattern may reflect the influence of historical European runoffs in the Mediterranean basin and diffused sources for OCs in remote Atlantic islands. Spatial patterns also emerged within the Atlantic basin, probably associated with pollutant long-range transport and recent inputs of DDT in the food webs of shearwaters from Cape Verde and the Canary islands. Moreover, a positive association of OC concentrations with delta(15)N within each locality points out diet specialization as a major factor explaining differences in OCs at the intraspecific level. Overall, this study highlights wide range breeding seabirds, such as Calonectris shearwaters, as suitable organisms for biomonitoring large geographic trends of organochlorine contamination in the marine environment.",M1
20199076,"Spatial and seasonal distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) in the vicinity of an iron and steel making plant.Four consecutive passive air samplings (September 2006-July 2007) were conducted at 15 sites around an iron and steel making plant in Pohang, Korea to investigate the spatial and seasonal distributions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ultimately the source-receptor relationships. Annual mean values of Sigma(8)PCBs (IUPAC number 8, 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) were in the range of 15.1-166 pg/m(3) with an average of 53.0 pg/m(3). The spatial distribution of PCBs for each sampling period clearly suggests that the steel complex is a major source of PCBs in this area, and the prevailing winds facilitated the atmospheric transport and dispersion of PCBs from the steel complex to the surrounding areas. Seasonal patterns of PCBs were observed clearly, which were influenced by meteorological conditions; the highest levels of PCBs were observed with the highest average air temperature, and the influence of rainfall (i.e., wet scavenging) was also observed. In addition, PCB 11, a non-Aroclor congener, was detected in high concentrations at all sites, implying that the sources of PCB 11 are both unique and ubiquitous. This study confirms that passive air sampling is a useful tool to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of time-averaged POPs data at a local scale.",M1
20193093,"Effects of decontaminated fish oil or a fish and vegetable oil blend on persistent organic pollutant and fatty acid compositions in diet and flesh of Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar).The health benefits of seafood are well documented and based on the unique supply of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). Aquaculture now contributes about 50 % of food-grade seafood globally and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a rich source of n-3 HUFA. However, salmon and other oily fish can accumulate lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POP), including dioxins (PCDD/F), polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), derived largely from feed. In the present study, triplicate groups of salmon, of initial weight 0.78 kg, were fed one of three experimental diets for 11 weeks. The diets were coated with either a northern fish oil (FO) with a high POP content (cNFO), the same oil that had been decontaminated (deNFO) or a blend of southern fish oil, rapeseed and soyabean oils (SFO/RO/SO). Dietary PCDD/F+dioxin-like PCB (DL-PCB) concentrations were 17.36, 0.45 and 0.53 ng toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg, respectively. After 11 weeks, the flesh concentrations in fish fed the cNFO, deNFO and SFO/RO/SO diets were 6.42, 0.34 and 0.41 ng TEQ/kg, respectively. There were no differences in flesh EPA and DHA between fish fed the cNFO or deNFO diets although EPA and DHA were reduced by 50 and 30 %, respectively, in fish fed the SFO/RO/SO diet. Thus, decontaminated FO can be used to produce salmon high in n-3 HUFA and low in POP. Salmon produced using deNFO would be of high nutritional value and very low in POP and would utilise valuable fish oils that would otherwise be destroyed due to their high pollutant concentrations.",M1
20192254,"Polychlorinated biphenyl and low polybrominated diphenyl ether transfer to milk in lactating goats chronically exposed to contaminated soil.This study investigated milk excretion kinetics of <e>PCBs</e>, tetra-BDE (BDE 47), and penta-BDE (BDE 99) in goats exposed to contaminated soil under controlled conditions. The animals were fed (80 days) with feed containing 5% of contaminated soil. During this exposure period, milk was analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment the PCBs and PBDEs retained in hepatic and adipose tissues were also determined. The soil-milk carry over rates (CORs) of PCBs ranged from 6 to 62%. This result suggests that a large part of ingested soil-bound PCBs was recovered in milk. Significantly different levels between the congeners were reported in the tissues (fat, liver). BDE 47 and 99 excretions in milk achieved a plateau after 2 weeks of exposure, and their corresponding CORs were about 30%. These two congeners showed a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower accumulation in the adipose tissue than the major PCB congeners. The concentrations of BDE 47 and 99 in the liver were the same as PCB concentrations. This result suggests that the low brominated congeners are submitted to the metabolism more extensively than the major PCBs.",M1
20183510,"By-side PCDD/Fs in technical <e>PCB</e> formulations of Kanechlor series.The Japanese Kanechlor technical PCB formulations such as KC-300, KC-400, KC-500, KC-600 and KC-1000 have been examined for possible contamination with by-side PCDD/Fs. 75 PCDDs and 135 PCDF have been determined using isotope dilution, separation and enrichment on silica gel impregnated with activated carbon, and final HRGC/HRMS measurement. MonoCDDs to OCDD were absent in KC-300, KC-600 and KC-1000. Tetra- and PentaCDDs occurred at &gt; 1 ng/g in KC-400 and KC-500. The Kanechlors were contaminated with nearly all 135 PCDFsw. In parallel with an increasing degree of chlorination of a particular Kanechlor formulation examined increased also the content of more chlorinated PCDFs. In term of total dioxin-like toxicity and TEQ loads the KC-500 contained highly toxic PCDD/Fs at 270 ng TEQ/g and followed by KC-400 with 269 ng TEQ/g, KC-600 with 188 ng TEQ/g, KC-1000 with 164 ng TEQ/g and KC-300 with 79 ng TEQ/g. From 99.5 to 100% of PCDD/Fs toxicity found in the Kanechlors was from PCDFs.",M1
20178383,"Selecting an appropriate multivariate source apportionment model result.Two easily available multivariate source apportionment models, Unmix and positive matrix factorization (PMF), often produce nearly the same source apportionment. However, this paper gives two examples in which this is not the case: a simulated air pollution data set of 8 species and 200 samples and a water quality data set of 32 <e>PCB</e> congeners and 106 sediment core samples from Sheboygan River Inner Harbor, WI. In the first case, a basic form of PMF fails primarily because the source compositions do not have any species with zero or near zero concentrations. Unmix produces source compositions and contributions that are much closer to the true values. A version of PMF with an adjustable parameter also gives good results. In the second case, each model found 5 sources for the Sheboygan PCB sediment data. PMF determined sources compositions were consistent with the original 50/50% Aroclor 1248/1254 mixture, a previously determined prominent dechlorination profile (processes H' + M), and three other partially dechlorinated profiles. The Unmix determined source compositions were not as successful as the Unmix results depended heavily on just three data points. Source apportionment results favor Unmix when edges in the data are well-defined and PMF when several zeros are present in the loading and score matrices. Since both models are seen to have potential weaknesses, both should be applied in all cases. If the two methods do not produce similar results the methods given in the paper can be used to select the model result most likely to be closest to the truth.",M1
20172095,"Evaluation of Soxhlet extraction, accelerated solvent extraction and microwave-assisted extraction for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in soil and fish samples.Three commonly applied extraction techniques for persistent organic chemicals, Soxhlet extraction (SE), accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), were applied on soil and fish samples in order to evaluate their performances. For both <e>PCBs</e> and PBDEs, the two more recent developed techniques (ASE and MAE) were in general capable of producing comparable extraction results as the classical SE, and even higher extraction recoveries were obtained for some PCB congeners with large octanol-water partitioning coefficients (K(ow)). This relatively uniform extraction results from ASE and MAE indicated that elevated temperature and pressure are favorable to the efficient extraction of PCBs from the solid matrices. For PBDEs, difference between the results from MAE and ASE (or SE) suggests that the MAE extraction condition needs to be carefully optimized according to the characteristics of the matrix and analyte to avoid degradation of higher brominated BDE congeners and improve the extraction yields.",M1
20171977,"Changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase in cerebellar granule neurons by polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polychlorinated biphenyls.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as additive flame retardants and have been detected in human blood, adipose tissue, and breast milk. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the effects of PBDEs are similar to the known human developmental neurotoxicants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) on a molar basis. Previously, we reported that PBDE mixtures and congeners, perturbed calcium homeostasis which is critical for the development and function of the nervous system. In the present study, we tested whether environmentally relevant PBDE/PCB mixtures and congeners affected mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are down-stream events of calcium signaling in cerebellar granule neuronal cultures. In this study, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)1/2, a widely studied MAPK cascade and known to be involved in learning and memory, levels were quantitated using western blot technique with phospho-specific antibodies. Glutamate (a positive control) increased pERK1/2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner reaching maximum activation at 5-30min of exposure and at doses &gt; or =10microM. Both Aroclor 1254 (a commercial penta PCB mixture) and DE-71 (a commercial penta PBDE mixture) elevated phospho-ERK1/2, producing maximum stimulation at 30min and at concentrations &gt; or =3microg/ml; Aroclor 1254 was more efficacious than DE-71. DE-79 (an octabrominated diphenyl ether mixture) also elevated phospho-ERK1/2, but to a lesser extent than that of DE-71. PBDE congeners 47, 77, 99, and 153 also increased phospo-ERK1/2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The data indicated that PBDE congeners are more potent than the commercial mixtures. PCB 47 also increased phospho-ERK1/2 like its structural analog PBDE 47, but to a lesser extent, suggesting that these chemicals affect similar pathways. Cytotoxicity, measured as %LDH release, data showed that higher concentrations (&gt;30microM) and longer exposures (&gt;30min) are required to see cell death. These results show that PBDE mixtures and congeners activate MAPK pathway at concentrations where no significant cytotoxicity was observed, suggesting that perturbed intracellular signaling including MAPK pathway might be involved in the initiation of adverse effects, including learning and memory, related to these persistent chemicals.",M1
20170162,"Estimation of <e>PCB</e> stocks, emissions, and urban fate: will our policies reduce concentrations and exposure?PCBs, used to manage risks from the flammability of dielectric fluids and to increase the durability of elastic sealants, had declining environmental concentrations after legislation banning new production was passed during the 1970s and 1980s in Europe and North America. To answer why PCB temporal trends are now nearly stable and if current policies will further reduce concentrations and our exposure, we estimated PCB stocks in Toronto, Canada (population of approximately 2.5 million) of 437 (282-796) tonnes, of which 97 and 3% are in closed sources and building sealants, respectively. The greatest geographic density of PCBs is downtown, specifically in commercial, electricity-intensive skyscrapers. An unknown stock is within now-buried landfills and other waste-handling facilities as well as diffuse sources such as electrical wiring and paints. Using the Multimedia Urban Model, we estimated city-wide emissions of approximately 0.14-1.4 mg m(-2) y(-1) or 35-350 mg capita(-1) y(-1) of SigmaPCB(70), which is approximately 0.01-0.3% annually of total documented stocks. Canada, as one of 159 signatories of the Stockholm Convention and the 35 parties that have reported progress toward environmentally sound management of their PCB inventories by 2028, has passed national legislation with a timetable of inventory reductions. It is unclear whether this legislation will successfully reduce concentrations and exposures, however the analysis should inform our management of other contaminants.",M1
20169415,"Detection and quantitative analysis of organochlorine compounds (<e>PCBs</e> and DDTs) in deep sea fish liver from Mediterranean Sea.BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) concentrations were determined in the liver of two deep sea fish species, Mediterranean slimehead and blackfin sorcerer, from the Adriatic Sea (southeastern Mediterranean Sea). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The examination of congener profiles showed that hexachlorinated molecules were dominant (hexa-CBs, 55.3-56.2%), followed by penta-CBs (21.5-21.8%) and hepta-PCB 180 (14.9-16.0%). PCB 138, 153 and 180 were the prominent congeners accounting for 69.3% of the total PCBs. Among the compounds of DDT, p,p'-DDE was the most dominant molecule (Mediterranean slimehead, 86.6%; blackfin sorcerer, 92.8%), demonstrating the old age of these compounds in the environment. In both species, PCB contents were higher than those of DDTs. Contaminant load was higher in Mediterranean slimehead (PCBs, 1,086 ng g(-1) lipid weight; DDTs, 799 ng g(-1) lipid weight) than in blackfin sorcerer (PCBs, 561 ng g(-1) lipid weight; DDTs, 224 ng g(-1) lipid weight). CONCLUSION: The high ratios SigmaPCBs/SigmaDDTs indicated predominantly industrial versus agrarian activities in the area. Dioxins toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations (8.1-18.7 pg TEQ per gram wet weight) reached those encountered in marine organisms at higher levels in the trophic chain, revealing the onerous status of contamination by PCBs in Mediterranean deep sea biota.",M1
20167327,"Measurements of coeluting unlabeled and 13C-labeled polychlorinated biphenyl congeners with partially overlapping fragment profiles using a tandem mass spectrometry.(13)C-labeled compounds are often employed as surrogate or internal standards to monitor the performance of extraction and instrumental analysis procedures for their unlabeled counterparts. However, labeled and unlabeled counterparts most often coelute chromatographically with overlapping mass ion fragments, posing a challenge to the accurate quantification of these compounds. In the present study, an analytical scheme, using coeluting unlabeled and (13)C-labeled polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) congeners as the model compounds, was developed with a low-resolution tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) to determine the appropriate ranges of PCB congener concentrations that satisfy the no-interference condition. Interferences from unlabeled PCBs to quantitation of labeled counterparts could be minimized when (13)C-labeled PCB congeners were quantified in the MS/MS mode within a certain concentration range. In addition, good agreements between the measured and theoretically predicted quantitation errors were observed for all labeled PCB congeners except PCB 180. The exception with labeled PCB 180 was mainly attributed to the occurrence of instrumental analytical uncertainty, as analytical error was also observed with absence of unlabeled PCB 180. These results indicate that MS/MS techniques can serve as a useful tool to minimize interferences with quantitation of isotopically labeled compounds from their unlabeled counterparts, which possess partially overlapping ion fragment profiles.",M1
20160415,"The effect of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl (OH-<e>PCB</e>) on thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-mediated transcription through native-thyroid hormone response element (TRE).Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are known as environmental contaminants that may cause abnormal effect in various organs. We have previously reported that low dose of hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) including 4'-OH-2',3,3',4',5'-pentachloro biphenyl (4'-OH-PCB 106), suppressed thyroid hormone (TH) receptor (TR)-mediated transcription on several artificial TH-response elements (TREs) due to partial dissociation of TR from TRE. In the present study, we examined the effect of OH-PCB on TR-mediated transcription on native TRE-containing promoter, using malic enzyme (ME)-TRE. Transcriptional activity was measured by transient transfection based reporter gene assay in CV-1, fibroblast-derived clonal cells. TR-mediated transcription was suppressed by 4'-OH-PCB106 significantly and 4'-OH-PCB187 weakly, but not by 4'-OH-PCB165. To examine TR-TRE bindings under exposure of 4'-OH-PCB106, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed. In EMSA, TR was dissociated from ME-TRE by 4'-OH-PCB106. These findings suggest that OH-PCB may disrupt TR-mediated transcription on native promoter.",M1
20153926,"Characterization of the microbial community from the marine sediment of the Venice lagoon capable of reductive dechlorination of coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>).The native microbial community of a contaminated sediment from Brentella Canal (Venice Lagoon, Italy) was enriched in slurry microcosms consisting of sterile sediment suspended in sterile site water in the presence of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3,3',4,4',5- and 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyls, 3,3',4,4',5,5'- and 2,3,3',4,4',5-hexachlorobiphenyls. The enrichment cultures were characterized at each subculturing step by 16S rRNA gene Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. About 90% of spiked polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were stoichiometrically converted into di- and tri-chlorinated congeners by each enriched culture via dechlorination of flanked para chlorines and ortho-flanked meta chlorines. A 2-fold increase in PCB-dechlorination rate, the disappearance of lag phase, as well as a remarkable increase of sulfate consumption and a decline of methanogenic activity, were observed throughout subculturing. A reduction of complexity of the archaeal community, which was composed by Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, was also observed as a result of culture enrichment. The bacterial community included members of the Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon divisions of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi. Two sequence phylotypes related to the genus Sulforovum and the species Desulfococcus multivorans and two Chloroflexi enriched throughout subculturing, thus suggesting that these bacteria were involved in PCB dechlorination in the marine sediments of Brentella canal.",M1
20146445,"Transport of semivolatile organic compounds to the Tibetan plateau: spatial and temporal variation in air concentrations in mountainous Western Sichuan, China.The distribution of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in air along an altitudinal transect on Balang Mountain in western China was measured by deploying XAD-2 resin based passive air samplers in duplicate at seven sites with elevations ranging from 1242 to 4485 m above sea level for five consecutive six-month periods between 2005 and 2008. Analyzed by gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, concentrations of hexachlorobenzene were highest, followed by hexachlorocyclohexanes, DDT-related compounds and <e>PCB</e> congeners 28 and 52. Except for hexachlorobenzene, which had largely uniform concentrations in space and time, there were clear seasonal variations with concentrations in summer being higher than in winter. With a few exceptions, concentrations that vary little with altitude suggest that the presence of these chemicals in the area is almost entirely due to atmospheric transport, most likely from the Chengdu plain. This is supported by similarities in the relative abundance of different compounds and in the differences between summer and winter concentrations measured in the city of Chengdu and in the mountains. Furthermore, air mass trajectories during the sampling period often originate to the East, passing over the Western part of the Sichuan basin, including the Chengdu plain, prior to arriving at the sampling sites. Higher summer time values in the mountains are due to more contaminated air being blown into the region, presumably due either to higher pesticide usage in summer or due to higher temperatures leading to higher evaporation in source regions. Air and soil from the region are in equilibrium with respect to alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, and HCB, whereas a situation of net deposition prevails for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT.",M1
20138643,"History of Inuit community excretion of polychlorinated biphenyls recorded in sewage lake sediments.Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) is high among the Inuit resulting from ingestion of contaminated wild  country  foods. These contaminants originate in urban/industrial areas and reach the Arctic by long-range atmospheric transport. Ingested PCBs eventually equilibrate into various body components, including feces, which become an indication of body burden. Bulk domestic sewage residue from a community will accumulate PCBs from feces; long-term accumulated sediments from a sewage treatment system are a historical indicator of changes in community-wide PCB excretion. In this study, sediment cores were collected from the domestic sewage treatment lake, known as Annak, for the Inuit Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, Canada (established 1967), and were dated (Pb-210, Cs-137) and analyzed for 127 PCB congeners. We focused our attention on the 47 congeners that were observed consistently. Atmospheric and local inputs to a nearby lake accounted for local background. PCB inputs from sewage grew rapidly from the late 1960s until 1990. The maximum 47 congener SigmaPCB excretion occurred in approximately 1989 (11116 ng person(-1)d(-1)); all sewage PCB inputs were dominated by PCB 153, PCB 138 and PCB 180. PCB ingestion from a Sanikiluaq food survey in 1989 for 11 of the most highly concentrated PCB congeners (7270 ng person(-1)d(-1)) was the same as our excretion estimate for the same congeners (7348 ng person(-1)d(-1)) that year, suggesting that by the late 1980s, the ingested amount of PCB was similar to what was excreted every day, although the latter is a reflection of body burden and not short-term exposure.",M1
20138284,"The non-modulated transfer of total effluent for serially coupled columns in gas chromatography.The non-modulated transfer (NMT) of the total effluent of the separation of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) on two columns coupled in series has been studied. A non-polar poly(5%-phenyl-95%-methyl)siloxane column (40 m x 100 microm x 0.1 microm) and a polar 70%-cyanopropyl-polysilphenylene-siloxane column (4 m x 0.1 mm x 0.1 microm) were used as (1)D and (2)D columns, respectively. The effluents from both the (1)D column and the (1)D+(2)D column series were monitored independently by two FIDs. Data from the (1)D and (1)D+(2)D integration reports were used to evaluate the NMT experiment. (1)D retention times, t(R,i,D1), were directly accessible from (1)D integration report while (2)D retention times, t(R,i,B), were calculated for all corresponding peak pairs from (1)D and (1)D+(2)D integration reports as a difference t(R,i,D2)=t(R,i,D1+D2)-t(R,i,D1). Search for corresponding peaks of PCB congeners in the (1)D and (1)D+(2)D chromatograms is elucidated in detail on standard PCB samples and on PCB congeners present in the technical formulation Arochlor 1242. Both retention times (t(R,i,D1) and t(R,i,D2)) as well as peak widths at half height (w(h,i)) and peak heights (h(i)) obtained from integration reports were used to construct 2D and 3D images for PCB NMT separations on serially coupled columns. The performance of the NMT procedure is illustrated by the separation of (i) standard PCB solutions, (ii) a mixture of the 209 PCBs, and (iii) a mixture of Arochlor 1242 and hydrocarbons on the DB-5+BPX-70 column series.",M1
20131898,"Fate of <e>PCB</e> congeners in an industrial harbor of Lake Michigan.We have quantified the release of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal (IHSC) to Lake Michigan and the atmosphere. Navigational dredging is planned for this system, and there is concern that dredging will result in releases of PCBs. We have analyzed greater than 158 PCBs in surficial sediment, water, suspended particles, and air. We predicted the release of PCBs from sediments to water and from water to air. To quantify the level of confidence in our calculations, we used a Monte Carlo simulation for each congener flux. We determined that 4 +/- 0.05 kg of summation operatorPCBs were released from the sediment to the water and 7 +/- 0.1 kg of summation operatorPCBs were volatilized from the water to the air annually. We measured input from the upstream regions of the canal system of 45.0 kg yr(-1) and export to Lake Michigan of 43.9 kg yr(-1). The summation operatorPCBs mass balance accounts for nearly all the PCB inputs and losses to the navigational regions. The congener profiles in sediment, water, and air support our determination that the contaminated sediment is a major source of PCBs into the water and air above it. We have shown that the system is currently a significant source of PCBs to the air and to Lake Michigan, even under quiescent conditions.",M1
20131785,"Local to continental influences on nutrient and contaminant sources to river birds.Stable isotope and contaminant analyses revealed differences in nutrient sources and contaminant pathways in two species of dipper, Cinclus mexicanus and Cinclus cinclus in western Canada and western Britain. We collected dipper prey and eggs from relatively pristine British Columbian rivers contrasting in the presence of salmon-derived nutrients, and rural Welsh rivers with varying food-web complexity associated with stream acidity. Enriched delta(13)C and to a lesser extent delta(15)N in American dipper eggs and prey confirmed that streams with migrating Pacific salmon were enriched with marine-derived nutrients, but overall contaminant concentrations did not differ strongly in dipper eggs between rivers with and without salmon. However dipper contaminant profiles, particularly PBDEs, mercury and SigmaDDTs, were related to delta(13)C, reflecting the marine influence and greater fish consumption at salmon sites. Irrespective of catchment influences and despite feeding at a higher trophic level, American dipper eggs (n = 17) contained lower levels of organohalogens than Eurasian dippers (n = 37), but with similar <e>PCB</e> (153 and 138) and PBDE (47 and 99) congeners dominanating. Eurasian dipper eggs from circumneutral streams contained more dieldrin, SigmaDDT and Sigmahexachlorocyclohexanes while Sigmachlordanes, mirex, SigmaPBDEs and SigmaPCBs predominated at acid sites. Our data reveal how dippers indicate contaminant levels and sources under contrasting conditions at scales ranging from local to intercontinental, but local environmental conditions apparently alter feeding ecology and exposure pathways even in these closely related species.",M1
20129604,"Body burdens of brominated flame retardants and other persistent organo-halogenated compounds and their descriptors in US girls.BACKGROUND: Levels of brominated flame retardants are increasing in US populations, yet little data are available on body burdens of these and other persistent hormonally active agents (HAAs) in school-aged children. Exposures to such chemicals may affect a number of health outcomes related to development and reproductive function. OBJECTIVE: Determine the distribution of biomarkers of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>), and organo-chlorinated pesticides (OCPs), such as DDT/DDE, in children, and their variation by key descriptor variables. METHODS: Ethnically diverse cohorts of girls 6-8 y old at baseline are being followed for growth and pubertal development in a multi-site, longitudinal study. Nearly 600 serum samples from the California and Ohio sites were analyzed for lipids, 35 PCB congeners, 11 PBDE congeners, and 9 OCPs. The biomarker distributions were examined and geometric means compared for selected analytes across categories of age, race, site, body mass index (BMI), parental education, maternal age at delivery, and breast feeding in adjusted models. RESULTS: Six PBDE congeners were detected among greater than 70% of samples, with BDE-47 having the highest concentration (median 42.2, range 4.9-855 ng/g lipid). Girls in California had adjusted geometric mean (GM) PBDE levels significantly higher than girls in Ohio. Furthermore, Blacks had significantly higher adjusted GMs of all six PBDE congeners than Whites, and Hispanics had intermediate values. GMs tended to be lower among more obese girls, while other variables were not strongly associated. In contrast, GMs of the six PCB congeners most frequently detected were significantly lower among Blacks and Hispanics than Whites. PCBs and the three pesticides most frequently detected were also consistently lower among girls with high BMI, who were not breast-fed, whose mothers were younger, or whose care-givers (usually parents) were less educated. Girls in California had higher GMs than in Ohio for the pesticides and most PCB congeners, but the opposite for CB-99 and -118. CONCLUSIONS: Several of these potential HAAs were detected in nearly all of these young girls, some at relatively high levels, with variation by geographic location and other demographic factors that may reflect exposure pathways. The higher PBDE levels in California likely reflect differences in fire regulation and safety codes, with potential policy implications.",M1
20123616,"Maternal serum preconception polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations and infant birth weight.BACKGROUND: Prenatal and postnatal polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCBs</e>) exposure has been associated with decrements in fetal and infant growth and development, although exposures during the preconception window have not been examined despite recent evidence suggesting that this window may correspond with the highest serum concentrations. OBJECTIVES: We assessed maternal serum PCB concentrations at two sensitive developmental windows in relation to birth weight. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 99 women as they began trying to become pregnant (preconception) and after a positive pregnancy test (prenatal); 52 (53%) women gave birth and represent the study cohort. Using daily diaries, women recorded sexual intercourse, menstruation, and home pregnancy test results until pregnant or up to 12 menstrual cycles with intercourse during the estimated fertile window. With gas chromatography with electron capture, 76 PCB congeners were quantified (nanograms per gram serum) and subsequently categorized by purported biologic activity. Serum PCBs were log-transformed and entered both as continuous and categorized exposures along with birth weight (grams) and covariates [smoking (yes/no), height (inches), and infant sex (male/female)] into linear regression. RESULTS: A substantial reduction in birth weight (grams) was observed for women in the highest versus the lowest tertile of preconception antiestrogenic PCB concentration (beta; = 429.3 g, p = 0.038) even after adjusting for covariates (beta; = 470.8, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data reflect the potential developmental toxicity of antiestrogenic PCBs, particularly during the sensitive preconception critical window among women with environmentally relevant chemical exposures, and underscore the importance of PCB congener-specific investigation.",M1
20122983,"Influence of polychlorinated biphenyls and their hydroxylated metabolites on prostaglandins secretion from epithelial cells of bovine oviduct, in vitro.Polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) markedly stimulate bovine uterine contractions and prostaglandin (PG) F2alpha secreted from both, myometrial and endometrial cells is essentially involved in this process. Since contractions of the oviduct are crucial for gametes and embryo transport, therefore the goal of this study was to investigate the influence of PCBs on PGF2alpha and PGE2 secretion from oviductal epithelium. Epithelial cells of the oviduct, from cows and heifers on days 1-5 of estrous cycle, were treated with PCBs: technical mixture (Aroclor 1248; Ar 1248), individual congeners (PCB 30 and PCB 153) and hydroxylated metabolites (PCB 30-OH and PCB 50-OH). Viability of the cells after treatment with PCBs (10 and 100 ng/ml) was determined after 24, 48 and 72 h. The concentration of PGFM (metabolite of PGF2alpha) and PGE2 in culture medium was determined after 2 and 48 h of incubation with PCBs (0.1, 1 and 10 ng/ml). None of the PCBs affected (P&gt;0.05) cell viability, whereas all of them, except PCB 30 after 48 h of treatment, increased (P&lt;0.05-0.01) PGF2alpha secretion from epithelial cells. All PCBs also stimulated (P&lt;0.05) the PGE2 secretion after 2h of incubation, but this effect was less evident or there was no effect after 48 h of treatment. We conclude that oviductal secretion of PGF2alpha and PGE2 is affected by PCBs and this can be a part of the mechanism by means of which PCBs may affect the contractions of bovine oviduct.",M1
20122686,"An evaluation of the sexual differences in the accumulation of organochlorine compounds in children at birth and at the age of 4 years.This study of the body burden and serum concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs), represents a general population in a cohort from Menorca Island (birth 1997-1998) of children at birth and at 4 years of age; the study has shown that the concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDT, polychlorobiphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) congeners #153, #138 and #180 and total PCBs in sera collected at 4 years are much higher in breastfed children than in those fed with formula, e.g. HCB 0.48 vs 0.21 ng/ml, beta-HCH 0.32 vs 0.24 ng/ml, total DDTs 2.2 vs 0.57 ng/ml and total PCBs 1.4 vs 0.52 ng/ml. Comparison of gender differences in 4 years old children shows higher concentrations of all examined OCs in females than in males with the exception of HCB and PeCB in breastfed children, which are higher in males than in females, e.g. beta-HCH 0.34 vs 0.28 ng/ml, total DDTs 2.6 vs 1.7 ng/ml and total PCBs 1.6 vs 1.0 ng/ml for breastfed children and beta-HCH 0.23 vs 0.19 ng/ml, total DDTs 0.59 vs 0.48 ng/ml and total PCBs 0.58 vs 0.45 ng/ml for formula fed children. Gender comparison of the body burden between children fed with breastmilk or formula also shows higher concentrations in females than in males, e.g. beta-HCH 0.47 vs 0.35 microg, total DDTs 3.0 vs 1.8 microg and total PCBs 1.9 vs 1.2 microg for breastfed children, and beta-HCH 0.39 vs 0.17 microg, total DDTs 0.48 vs 0.27 microg and total PCBs 0.66 vs 0.55 microg for formula fed children. The results may suggest a higher capacity in female children for the retention of OCs incorporated through breastfeeding. However, these results should be taken with caution because the differences of the gender averages have low statistically significance when evaluated with the Student test.",M1
20106937,"Prenatal organochlorine exposure and behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in school-aged children.Organochlorines are environmentally persistent contaminants that readily cross the placenta, posing a potential risk to the developing fetus. Evidence for neurodevelopmental effects at low levels of these compounds is growing, though few studies have focused on behavioral outcomes. The authors investigated the association between prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) levels and behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), measured with the Conners' Rating Scale for Teachers (CRS-T), in a cohort of 607 children aged 7-11 years (median age, 8.2 years) born in 1993-1998 to mothers residing near a PCB-contaminated harbor in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The median umbilical cord serum level of the sum of 4 prevalent PCB congeners (118, 138, 153, and 180) was 0.19 ng/g serum (range, 0.01-4.41 ng/g serum). The authors found higher risk for ADHD-like behaviors assessed with the CRS-T at higher levels of PCBs and p,p'-DDE. For example, the authors found higher risk of atypical behavior on the Conners' ADHD Index for the highest quartile of the sum of 4 PCB congeners versus the lowest quartile (risk ratio = 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 2.92) and a similar relation for p,p'-DDE. These results support an association between low-level prenatal organochlorine exposure and ADHD-like behaviors in childhood.",M1
20096358,"Occupational exposure to <e>PCBs</e> reduces striatal dopamine transporter densities only in women: a beta-CIT imaging study.We hypothesize that occupational exposure to PCBs is associated with a reduction in central dopamine (DA) similar to changes previously seen in PCB exposed adult non-human primates. To test that hypothesis, we used [(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT imaging to estimate basal ganglia DA transporter density in former capacitor workers. Women, but not men, showed an inverse relationship between lipid-adjusted total serum PCB concentrations and DA transporter densities in the absence of differences in serum PCB concentrations. These sex differences may reflect age-related reductions in the levels of gonadal hormones since these hormones have been shown experimentally to alter response to DA neurotoxicants. These findings may aid in better understanding the roles that sex and age play in modifying central DA function following exposure, not only to PCBs, but also to other DA neurotoxicants as well as further elucidating the role of gonadal hormones in influencing the initiation and/or progression of neurodegenerative disorders.",M1
20092869,"Distribution and ecological risk of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides in surficial sediments from Haihe River and Haihe Estuary Area, China.Polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) and organochlorine pesticide (OCP) were analyzed in surficial sediments from the Haihe River and Haihe Estuary Area, Tianjin, China. The concentrations of [summation operator]PCBs (the sum of 32 PCB concentrations) and [summation operator]OCPs (the sum of eight OCPs concentrations) in the sediments from this area ranged from n.d. (not detected) to 253 ng g(-1) (average value: 66.8 ng g(-1)) and from 0.997 to 2447 ng g(-1) (average value: 738 ng g(-1)), respectively. Among the OCPs, the range of concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexane and its isomers (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were 0.997-1620 ng g(-1) (547 ng g(-1)), n.d. - 155 ng g(-1) (18.5 ng g(-1)) and n.d. - 835 ng g(-1) (173 ng g(-1)), respectively. In general, the concentrations of all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the Haihe River were higher than those from the Haihe Estuary Area. Compositional analyses of the POPs indicated that tri-PCBs were dominant in sediment from the Haihe River, while tetra-PCBs and penta-PCBs were identified as being prevalent in the Haihe Estuary Area. In addition, beta-HCH and p,p'-DDD were found to be the dominant HCHs and DDTs, respectively. Compared with other areas around the world, the concentrations of POPs in sediments from the Haihe River were higher, but pollution level was comparable with other areas in the Haihe Estuary Area. According to established sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), POPs in this area have potential ecological risk.",M1
20087190,"Plasma organochlorine levels and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a cohort of men.BACKGROUND: Environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) has been associated with the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Physicians' Health Study, a prospective cohort established in 1982. We measured concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE in baseline blood samples from 205 men later diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 409 age- and race-matched controls. Lipid-adjusted organochlorine concentrations were categorized into quintiles based on the distribution among controls. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each quintile relative to the lowest quintile. We also evaluated these associations for major histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. RESULTS: The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was positively associated with the sum of 51 PCB congeners assayed (SigmaPCB); the group of immunotoxic congeners; the individual congeners 118, 138, 153, and 180; and the sum of these 4 congeners. The simple OR for the highest quintile of lipid-adjusted SigmaPCB versus the lowest was 1.9 (95% CI = 1.1-3.2; test for trend, P = 0.001), with similar trends for individual congeners and groups defined as above. Adjustment for height, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking, and fish intake did not substantially change the effect estimates. No association was observed for p,p'-DDE. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in effects by histologic subtype of lymphoma; however, this analysis was underpowered. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis of a positive association between PCB exposure and development of NHL in men.",M1
20074778,"Sexual difference in <e>PCB</e> concentrations of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).We determined polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in 35 female coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and 60 male coho salmon caught in Lake Michigan (Michigan and Wisconsin, United States) during the fall of 1994 and 1995. In addition, we determined PCB concentrations in the skin-on fillets of 26 female and 19 male Lake Michigan coho salmon caught during the fall of 2004 and 2006. All coho salmon were age-2 fish. These fish were caught prior to spawning, and therefore release of eggs could not account for sexual differences in PCB concentrations because female coho salmon spawn only once during their lifetime. To investigate whether gross growth efficiency (GGE) differed between the sexes, we applied bioenergetics modeling. Results showed that, on average, males were 19% higher in PCB concentration than females, based on the 1994-1995 dataset. Similarly, males averaged a 20% higher PCB concentration in their skin-on fillets compared with females. According to the bioenergetics modeling results, GGE of adult females was less than 1% higher than adult male GGE. Thus, bioenergetics modeling could not explain the 20% higher PCB concentration exhibited by the males. Nonetheless, a sexual difference in GGE remained a plausible explanation for the sexual difference in PCB concentrations.",M1
20074772,"Inhibition of de novo synthesis of PCDD/Fs by SO2 in a model system.The effect of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) on de novo synthesis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) and biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>) was investigated in model systems containing carbon, activated by cupric chloride (CuCl(2)). Five types of carbons (activated carbon, three types of carbon blacks, and graphite) were used to test the universal character of our results. The influence of SO(2) on speciation and behavior of copper compounds, catalytic oxidation of carbons, and formation of organic chlorine (extractable organic chlorine and non-extractable organic chlorine) was also studied to investigate the inhibition mechanism of SO(2) on de novo synthesis. It was found that SO(2) can sulfate CuCl(2), but does not react with CuO and CuCl(2).CuO in a 10% O(2)/N(2) atmosphere at 300 degrees C. The suppression by SO(2) of organic chlorine (C-Cl) formation also confirmed these findings. It was also found that catalytic oxidation of carbons was strongly suppressed by SO(2). A dramatic decrease in PCDD/Fs formation was observed for all five carbons, while adding SO(2); at the same time the average chlorination level also decreased. However, the inhibiting effect on PCB was less apparent compared with that on PCDD/F. On the basis of the experimental results, the conversion of both cupric and cuprous chloride into the non-reactive sulfate was proposed as inhibition mechanism.",M1
20071006,"The use of blue tit eggs as a biomonitoring tool for organohalogenated pollutants in the European environment.In the present study, large scale geographical variation in the occurrence of organohalogenated pollutants (OHPs) was investigated throughout Europe using eggs of a terrestrial resident passerine species, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). Blue tit eggs from 10 sampling locations, involving suburban, rural and remote areas, in 7 European countries were collected and analysed. Sum polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) levels ranged from 150ng/g lipid weight (lw) to 2003ng/g lw. Sum polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) ranged from 3.95ng/g lw to 114ng/g lw. As expected, PCB and PBDE concentrations were significantly higher in the sampled suburban locations compared to the rural and remote locations. Sum organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) ranged from 122ng/g lw to 775ng/g lw. OCP concentrations were, against the expectations, found to be lower in the rural sampling locations compared to the other locations. Contamination profiles of PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs differed also among the sampling locations, which may be due to local contamination sources. Finally, we compared the results of this study with previously reported OHP concentrations in the eggs of a closely related species, the great tit (Parus major), from the same sampling locations in Europe. We found no differences in concentrations between the species. In addition, we found a significant, positive correlation between the sum PCB concentrations in blue tit eggs and great tit eggs, suggesting similar exposure pathways, mechanisms of accumulation and maternal transfer of PCBs. In conclusion, our results suggest the usefulness of eggs from passerine birds as a biomonitoring tool for OHPs on a large geographical scale.",M1
20067852,"Sexual difference in <e>PCB</e> concentrations of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from Lake Ontario.We determined polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in 61 female lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and 71 male lake trout from Lake Ontario (Ontario, Canada and New York, United States). To estimate the expected change in PCB concentration due to spawning, PCB concentrations in gonads and in somatic tissue of lake trout were also determined. In addition, bioenergetics modeling was applied to investigate whether gross growth efficiency (GGE) differed between the sexes. Results showed that, on average, males were 22% higher in PCB concentration than females in Lake Ontario. Results from the PCB determinations of the gonads and somatic tissues revealed that shedding of the gametes led to 3% and 14% increases in PCB concentration for males and females, respectively. Therefore, shedding of the gametes could not explain the higher PCB concentration in male lake trout. According to the bioenergetics modeling results, GGE of males was about 2% higher than adult female GGE, on average. Thus, bioenergetics modeling could not explain the higher PCB concentrations exhibited by the males. Nevertheless, a sexual difference in GGE remained a plausible explanation for the sexual difference in PCB concentrations of the lake trout.",M1
20067832,"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls enhances lipid peroxidation in human normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts: a potential role for myeloperoxidase.Nitric oxide, superoxide, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) produced under oxidative stress may contribute to the development of postoperative adhesions. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) on LPO, superoxide dismutase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nitrite/nitrate in human normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts. PCB treatment reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression as well as levels of nitrite/nitrate in both cell lines. Although there was no difference in iNOS expression between the two cell lines, adhesion fibroblasts manifested lower basal levels of MPO compared to normal peritoneal fibroblasts. There was a reduction in MPO expression and its activity in response to PCB treatment in normal peritoneal fibroblasts; however, this effect was minimal in adhesion fibroblasts. Moreover, adhesion fibroblasts manifested higher levels of LPO compared to normal peritoneal fibroblasts, whereas PCB treatment increased LPO levels in both cell types. We conclude that PCBs promote the development of the adhesion phenotype by generating an oxidative stress environment. This is evident by lower iNOS, MPO, and nitrite/nitrate and a simultaneous increase in LPO. Loss of MPO activity, possibly through a mechanism involving MPO heme depletion and free iron release, is yet another source of oxidative stress.",M1
20064788,"Polychlorinated biphenyls disrupt blood-brain barrier integrity and promote brain metastasis formation.BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects as well as neurotoxic properties in the brain. However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the hypothesis that exposure to individual PCB congeners can facilitate the development of brain metastases in immunocompetent mice via the disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: C57/Bl6 mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage, and 48 hr later they were injected with luciferase-labeled K1735 M2 melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. In addition, we evaluated the functional permeability of the BBB by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across the brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction (TJ) proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Oral administration of coplanar PCB126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB118, and non-coplanar PCB153 (each at 150 micromol/kg body weight) differentially altered expression of the TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the BBB. Most importantly, exposure to individual PCB congeners enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that exposure to individual PCBs can facilitate the formation of bloodborne metastases via alterations of the integrity of the brain capillary endothelium.",M1
20060150,"Experimental study on the effects of H(2)O on PCDD/Fs formation by de novo synthesis in carbon/CuCl(2) model system.The effects of H(2)O vapor on de novo synthesis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>) were investigated at two levels (none and 10 vol.%) in various model systems containing five different carbons, CuCl(2), and quartz, exposed to a flow of 10% O(2)/N(2) at 300 degrees Celsius. The influence of H(2)O was studied on (1) speciation and behavior of copper compounds, (2) catalytic oxidation of carbons of distinct reactivity, and (3) formation of organic chlorine compounds, with the aim to investigate any effects on de novo synthesis. It is found that H(2)O converts CuCl(2) to CuCl(2) x CuO, and finally to CuO in a flow of 10% O(2)/N(2) at 300 degrees Celsius and that it decreases of organic chlorine (C-Cl) formation. When CuCl(2) is supported on carbon, the addition of H(2)O promotes the catalytic oxidation of this carbon. When CuCl(2) is supported on quartz, however, H(2)O inhibits carbon oxidation. A decrease in chlorination level of PCDD/Fs and PCBs with water addition is observed for all (six) model ashes; yet this addition affects the yields of PCDD/Fs and PCBs differently. Under the experimental conditions tested H(2)O does not react with Cu(2)Cl(2), which is the catalyst of carbon oxidation. On the basis of the experimental results, the following mechanism is proposed: conversion of CuCl(2) into CuO which is less reactive in de novo synthesis and promotion of catalytic oxidation of carbon by Cu(2)Cl(2).",M1
20060148,"Chemical contaminants in fish species from rivers in the North of Luxembourg: Potential impact on the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra).Contamination levels of <e>PCBs</e>, and of the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were analyzed in four fish species from seven rivers in the North of Luxembourg. During August and September 2007, 85 samples of fish were collected belonging to four species: the stone loach (Barbatula barbatula, n=12 pools), the chub (Squalius cephalus, n=36), the barbel (Barbus barbus, n=23) and eel (Anguilla anguilla, n=14). The concentration of seven indicator PCBs ( summation operator(7)PCBs) reached a mean of 39ngg(-1) and varied between 4.0 and 346.2ngg(-1) (wet wt) depending on the site and species. Fish collected at Wallendorf on the Our River and sites on the Wiltz and the Clerve rivers showed the highest concentrations for PCBs. In comparison with 1994, PCB levels in fish decreased strongly during the last decade in these rivers. Lead was detected at low levels (0-181.4ngg(-1) wet wt). Mercury concentrations ranged between 10.3 and 534.5ngg(-1) (wet wt) exceeding maximum tolerable levels for human consumption of 500ngg(-1) in two fish out of 85. Chubs and eels from the S√ªre River were the most contaminated by mercury. Cadmium levels varied between 4.0 and 103.9ngg(-1) (wet wt). In addition to mercury in fish, cadmium was the most problematic pollutant on the Our, the Wiltz, the Clerve and the Troine Rivers, because values found in 20% of fish exceeded the threshold of about 10-50ngg(-1) (wet wt) recommended for human health. The total PCB level predicted to accumulate in livers from otter potentially feeding on these fish based on a previously published mathematical model is 37.7microgg(-1) (lipid wt), which is between a proposed  safe level  and a  critical level  for otters. Rivers in the North of Luxembourg are thus to some extent polluted, and the establishment of otter populations could be affected by current levels of contamination.",M1
20060147,"Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-<e>PCBs</e>) induce vitellogenin through estrogenic activity in primary-cultured hepatocytes of the Xenopus laevis.Vitellogenin (VTG)-inducing activities of 21 kinds of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) were investigated by an assay system using the primary-cultured hepatocyte of the adult male Xenopus laevis. An enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) was able to detect VTG at a minimum detection limit of 0.2ngmL(-1). The levels of VTG production in hepatocytes of male X. laevis exposed to six kinds of OH-PCB isomers (2'-OH-CB30, 3'-OH-CB30, 4'-OH-CB30, 4'-OH-CB50, 4'-OH-CB61 4'-OH-CB65) were significantly higher as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). The relative ranking of the OH-PCBs was E2 (100%), 4'-OH-CB30 (2.0%)&gt;2'-OH-CB30 (0.15%)&gt;4'-OH-CB61 (0.046%)&gt;3'-OH-CB30 (0.013%)&gt;4'-OH-CB50 (0.002%)&gt;4'-OH-CB65 (0.0001%). Although there were some differences between the estrogenicity values by the VTG-inducing activities and yeast two-hybrid assay for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). The results from VTG-assays suggested that an important factor for determining estrogenicity is the positions of the hydroxyl group and chlorine with the highest activity resulting from a para-hydroxyl group. The OH-PCB structures of high rank order in the VTG-assay had no chlorine substituted phenolic ring. Moreover, the meta-chlorine substituted phenolic ring is an important factor in determining estrogenicity. The OH-PCBs with meta-chlorine substituted phenolic ring did not show estrogenicity during VTG-assay.",M1

20058914,"Transformation of chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) in a stream food web.The enantiomeric composition of chiral PCB congeners was determined in Twelvemile Creek (Clemson, SC) to examine potential mechanisms of biotransformation in a stream food web. We measured enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of six PCB atropisomers (PCBs 84, 91, 95, 136, 149, and 174) in surface sediment, fine benthic organic matter (FBOM), coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), periphyton, Asian clam, mayflies, yellowfin shiner, and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) using gas chromatography (GC-ECD). Nonracemic EFs of PCBs 91, 95, 136, and 149 were measured in almost all samples. Enantiomeric compositions of PCBs 84 and 174 were infrequently detected with racemic EFs measured in samples except for a nonracemic EF of PCB 84 in clams. Nonracemic EFs of PCBs 91, 136, and 149 in SPMDs may be due to desorption of nonracemic residues from FBOM. EFs for some atropisomers were significantly different among FBOM, CPOM, and periphyton, suggesting that their microbial communities have different biotransformation processes. Nonracemic EFs in clams and fish suggest both in vivo biotransformation and uptake of nonracemic residues from their food sources. Longitudinal variability in EFs was generally low among congeners observed in matrices.",M1
20050031,"Polychlorinated biphenyls and Hudson River white perch: implications for population-level ecological risk assessment and risk management.Risk assessments and risk management decisions concerning risks to wild fish populations resulting from exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) and related chemicals have been based primarily on observations of effects of chemicals on individual organisms. Although the development and application of population-level ecological risk-assessment methods is proceeding at a rapid pace, the organism-level approach is still being justified by arguments that population-level ecological risk assessment is in an early stage of development and has not been shown to be reliable. This article highlights the importance of including population-level effects in risk-management decision-making, by examining the effects of exposures to PCBs on fish populations inhabiting the Hudson River, New York, USA, a system in which data have been collected for approximately 30 y concerning both concentrations of PCBs in sediment and fish tissue and the abundance and reproduction of exposed fish populations. We previously tested hypotheses concerning the effects of PCBs on the striped bass population of the Hudson River, and found that the available data conflicted with all of these hypotheses. Here, we report results of similar analyses of effects of historic PCB exposures on the Hudson River white perch population, using an extended data set that recently became available. As with striped bass, we found no correlation between maternal PCB tissue concentrations and any measure of reproductive success in Hudson River white perch during the 30-y period covered by the data set. Together with results of studies performed on fish populations exposed to PCBs at other sites, our results clearly demonstrate that physiological and genetic adaptation, biological compensation, and other ecological processes influence responses of fish populations to PCB exposures and should be considered in risk management decision-making.",M1
20049217,"Prenatal exposure to organohalogens, including brominated flame retardants, influences motor, cognitive, and behavioral performance at school age.BACKGROUND: Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) are known to have neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the influence of prenatal exposure to OHCs, including brominated flame retardants, on motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcome in healthy children of school age. METHODS: This study was part of the prospective Groningen infant COMPARE (Comparison of Exposure-Effect Pathways to Improve the Assessment of Human Health Risks of Complex Environmental Mixtures of Organohalogens) study. It included 62 children in whose mothers the following compounds had been determined in the 35th week of pregnancy: 2,2'-bis-(4 chlorophenyl)-1,1'-dichloroethene, pentachlorophenol (PCP), polychlorinated biphenyl congener 153 (<e>PCB</e>-153), 4-hydroxy-2,3,3',4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (4OH-CB-107), 4OH-CB-146, 4OH-CB-187, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and hexabromocyclododecane. Thyroid hormones were determined in umbilical cord blood. When the children were 5-6 years of age, we assessed their neuropsychological functioning: motor performance (coordination, fine motor skills), cognition (intelligence, visual perception, visuomotor integration, inhibitory control, verbal memory, and attention), and behavior. RESULTS: Brominated flame retardants correlated with worse fine manipulative abilities, worse attention, better coordination, better visual perception, and better behavior. Chlorinated OHCs correlated with less choreiform dyskinesia. Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls correlated with worse fine manipulative abilities, better attention, and better visual perception. The wood protective agent (PCP) correlated with worse coordination, less sensory integrity, worse attention, and worse visuomotor integration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that transplacental transfer of polybrominated flame retardants is associated with the development of children at school age. Because of the widespread use of these compounds, especially in the United States, where concentrations in the environment are four times higher than in Europe, these results cause serious concern.",M1
20048312,"Effect of plant age on <e>PCB</e> accumulation by Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo.A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) uptake and translocation from soil over time in pumpkin plants (Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo cv. Howden). Plants were grown in weathered soil collected from a former industrial site contaminated with Aroclor 1248 (mean [PCB](soil) = 6.5 mg kg(-1)). Plants were harvested five times over 42 d and analyzed for total PCB concentration in the root and shoot tissues. The concentration of PCBs in the root was not significantly different between harvests (mean [PCB](root) = 21.5 mg kg(-1)). The concentration of PCBs in the shoots was also relatively stable over time (mean [PCB](shoot) = 3.5 mg kg(-1)) despite increases in shoot biomass (fresh weight of 4.3 g at Day 12 to 59 g at Day 42). This suggests that PCBs were continuously accumulated throughout the growth period. The trends found in this study indicate the optimal time to harvest C. pepo ssp pepo plants to maximize PCB phytoextraction is when the plant shoot has reached its maximum biomass.",M1
20045174,"Mobilization of hydrophobic contaminants from soils by enzymatic depolymerization of soil organic matter.The effect of hydrolytic exoenzymes on the release of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOC) from two different surface soils was studied in laboratory batch experiments. Incubation of the soils with cellulase with an activity fivefold above the inherent soil activity enhanced the release of hydrophobic contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>) and hydroxylated PCB) by 40-200%. Xylanase and invertase did not show measurable effects at comparable relative activity levels. This suggests that cellulose substructures are important for the retention of HOC in soil organic matter (SOM). Hydrolytic exoenzymes, and the microorganisms that release them, contribute to the mobilization of HOC from soil, by shifting the sorption equilibrium in the course of SOM transformation into dissolved organic matter or by facilitating HOC diffusion as a consequence of reduced rigidity of SOM. We conclude that not only biodegradation but also sorption and desorption of HOC in soil can be influenced by (micro-) biology and the factors that determine its activity.",M1

The aim of the monitoring was to get a state-wide picture on the contamination level of sheep liver samples. Seventy two out of 77 investigated sheep liver samples exceeded the European maximum tolerance level for PCDD/PCDFs of 6.0 pg WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ g(-1) fat with measured average, median and maximum values of 23.9, 18.3 and 161 pg WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ g(-1) fat, respectively. Seventy-one samples also exceeded the cumulative maximum tolerance level of 12.0 pg WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ g(-1) fat set in the EU for the sum of PCDD/PCDFs and dl-PCBs in livers of sheep and derived products. Average, median and maximum measured values were 42.9, 33.9 and 204 pg WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ g(-1) fat, respectively. In the meat of the sheep only low amounts of PCDD/Fs or dl-PCBs were detected that never exceeded the respective maximum tolerance levels. The results did not show any significant differences in contamination between female or male sheep. Also no correlation was found between the age of the animals and the burden of their livers with PCDD/PCDFs or dl-PCBs. Health risks from the casual consumption of sheep livers are almost unlikely but can also not be excluded for individuals frequently consuming sheep livers with average contamination levels. Almost no difference was observed in the burden of contamination of sheep liver samples between rural and municipal areas or between areas located near or apart from waterways. In conclusion, the results yielded a picture of a varying but high level of contamination of sheep livers most likely caused by physiological differences compared to other animal species and by the ubiquitous environmental contamination primarily assignable to historic dioxin and PCB sources.",M1
20044120,"Extraction of <e>PCBs</e> and water from river sediment using liquefied dimethyl ether as an extractant.We investigated whether polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and water could be simultaneously removed from river sediment by solvent extraction using liquefied dimethyl ether (DME) as the extractant. DME exists in a gaseous state at normal temperature and pressure and can dissolve organic substances and some amount of water; therefore, liquefied DME under moderate pressure (0.6-0.8 MPa) at room temperature can be effectively used to extract PCBs and water from contaminated sediment, and it can be recovered from the extract and reused easily. First, we evaluated the PCB and water extraction characteristics of DME from contaminated sediment. We found that 99% of PCBs and 97% of water were simultaneously extracted from the sediment using liquefied DME at an extraction time of 4320 s and a liquefied DME/sediment ratio of 60 mL g(-1). The extraction rate of PCBs and water was expressed in terms of a pseudo-first-order reaction rate. Second, we estimated the amount of DME that was recovered after extraction. We found that 91-92% of DME could be recovered. In other words, approximately 5-10% of DME was lost during extraction and recovery. It is necessary to optimize this process in order to recover DME efficiently. The extraction efficiency of the recovered DME is similar to that of the pure DME. From the results, we conclude that solvent extraction using liquefied DME is suitable for extracting PCBs and water from contaminated sediment.",M1
20042278,"Contamination and congener profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls from different agricultural top soils in a county of the Tailake Region, China.Hundred topsoil (0-20 cm) samples under different land use types were collected from a county in the Tailake Region, China and analyzed for 18 polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) including five dioxin-like PCBs. The mean concentration of total PCBs (SigmaPCBs) for all sites was 1.071 microg kg(-1) dry weight (dw) with a range of 0.016 microg kg(-1) to 4.050 microg kg(-1), and the concentration of total Dioxin-like PCBs (SigmaDioxin-like PCBs) was 0.352 microg kg(-1) about 33% of SigmaPCBs. The concentration of SigmaPCBs in paddy field (PF) soils with a mean of 1.63 microg kg(-1) was higher than that in vegetable soil with a mean of 0.882 microg kg(-1), but the concentration of Dioxin-like PCBs in PF soil was lower than that in commercial vegetable production soil. The concentration of heavier weighted molecular PCB congeners (&gt; or = penta-PCBs) in vegetable soil accounted for 98% of SigmaPCBs, while that in Paddy field soil for 65% of SigmaPCBs.",M1
20036006,"Contaminant fate and transport in the Venice Lagoon: results from a multi-segment multimedia model.Contaminant loadings to the Venice Lagoon peaked from 1950s-1980s and although they have since declined, contaminant concentrations remain elevated in sediment and seafood. In order to identify the relative importance of contaminant sources, inter-media exchange and removal pathways, a modified 10-segment fugacity/aquivalence-based model was developed for octachlorodibenzodioxin/furan (OCDD/F), <e>PCB</e>-180, Pb and Cu in the Venice Lagoon. Results showed that in-place pollution nearby the industrial area, current industrial discharges, and tributary loadings were the main sources of contaminants to the lagoon, with negligible contributions from the atmosphere. The fate of these contaminants was governed by sediment-water exchange with simultaneous advective transport by water circulation. Contaminants circulated amongst the northern and central basins with a small fraction reaching the far southern basin and the Chioggia inlet. As a consequence, we estimated limited contaminant transfer to the Adriatic Sea, trapping the majority of contaminants in the sediment in this  average  circulation scenario which does not account for periodic flooding events.",M1
20035326,"A longitudinal study of trends in blood dioxins and dioxin-like compounds levels in residents from two locations in Japan during 2002-2006.To investigate the recent changes in background exposure to dioxin-related compounds, the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-<e>PCBs</e>) in the blood of individual residents in Japan were repeatedly examined. Twenty-six subjects (mean age, 52.7 +/- 1.8) from District A and 23 subjects (mean age, 56.1 +/- 1.2) from District B were longitudinally analyzed from 2002 to 2006. District A is a rural area in Osaka prefecture, and District B is an urban area in Saitama prefecture. For the longitudinal analysis of these concentrations, we used the generalized estimating equation (GEE). The PCDD + PCDF concentrations decreased significantly between 2002 and 2006 (p &lt; 0.0001), but the concentrations of dl-PCBs declined to a smaller degree over the 5-year period. A time x body mass index (BMI) interaction suggests that the reduction rate of blood PCDDs + PCDFs and dl-PCB concentrations in subjects with a BMI greater than the 75th percentile is lower than that of subjects with a BMI less than the 75th percentile from 2002 to 2004 over the 5-year period. From other reports on the dietary intake of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dl-PCBs in Japan, the total amount of daily dioxin intake decreased, but the percentage of dl-PCBs increased yearly in the first half of the 2000s. The reason for the difference in the 5-year change in blood concentrations between PCDDs +PCDFs and dl-PCBs may be explained by the yearly change in the dietary dioxin intake.",M1
20027164,"Fish oil and cod liver as safe and healthy food supplements.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the content of mercury, methylmercury and persistent organic pollutants in the capsules filled with fish oil from marine fish and in the canned cod liver and find out, whether analyse products are safe and suitable for human consumption. METHODS: Total mercury was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy on an AMA-254 (Altec Ltd., Czech Republic) single-purpose mercury analyzer. Methylmercury in the cod liver in the form of chlorid methylmercury was determined by gas chromatography. Seven indicator congeners of <e>PCB</e> (PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180), HCH, HCB, DDT and its degradation products DDE and DDD, were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In capsules filled with fish oil (n=19) total Hg levels were in the range of 0.013 to 2.03 ng/g. All the capsule oil samples analyzed for MeHg were below the detection limit. The highest concentration of total Hg was found in cod liver - can A (0.223 ng/g). The maximum percentage of MeHg in total Hg concentration was found in a liver sample - can B. The values of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta- HCH and of HCB were found below the detection limits in all the capsule samples analyzed. In eight capsules, the presence of highly lipophilic PCB congeners was demonstrated. DDT and its important DDE metabolite were found in ten samples. In canned cod liver the highest concentration of all PCB congeners was demonstrated in can D. The lowest congener concentrations, however, were found in smoked cod liver - can C. DDT with its main metabolite DDE was detected in can C. No additional DDT and DDD persistent pollutants were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of fish oil in capsules, and canned cod liver is safe and healthy and should be encouraged.",M1
20025228,"Spider-mediated flux of <e>PCBs</e> from contaminated sediments to terrestrial ecosystems and potential risks to arachnivorous birds.We investigated aquatic insect utilization and PCB exposure in riparian spiders at the Lake Hartwell Superfund site (Clemson, SC). We sampled sediments, adult chironomids, terrestrial insects, riparian spiders (Tetragnathidae, Araneidae, and Mecynogea lemniscata), and upland spiders (Araneidae) along a sediment contamination gradient. Stable isotopes (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) indicated that riparian spiders primarily consumed aquatic insects whereas upland spiders consumed terrestrial insects. PCBs in chironomids (mean 1240 ng/g among sites) were 2 orders of magnitude higher than terrestrial insects (15.2 ng/g), similar to differences between riparian (820-2012 ng/g) and upland spiders (30 ng/g). Riparian spider PCBs were positively correlated with sediment concentrations for all taxa (r(2) = 0.44-0.87). We calculated spider-based wildlife values (WVs, the minimum spider PCB concentrations causing physiologically significant doses in consumers) to assess exposure risks for arachnivorous birds. Spider concentrations exceeded WVs for most birds at heavily contaminated sites and were approximately 14-fold higher for the most sensitive species (chickadee nestlings, Poecile spp.). Spiders are abundant and ubiquitous in riparian habitats, where they depend on aquatic insect prey. These traits, along with the high degree of spatial correlation between spider and sediment concentrations we observed, suggest that they are model indicator species for monitoring contaminated sediment sites and assessing risks associated with contaminant flux into terrestrial ecosystems.",M1
20020106,"Gene expression profiles in the brain of the neonate mouse perinatally exposed to methylmercury and/or polychlorinated biphenyls.Methylmercury (MeHg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) are environmentally persistent neurodevelopmental toxicants. The primary source of human exposure is the consumption of contaminated fish, seafood and marine mammals. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of MeHg and PCB toxicities and interactions between these contaminants. We investigated the functional profiles of differently expressed genes in the brains of offspring mice perinatally exposed to MeHg and/or PCBs to elucidate how these contaminants interact with each other. Pregnant mice (C57BL/6) were divided into four groups by exposure: (1) vehicle control, (2) MeHg alone, (3) PCBs alone, (4) MeHg + PCBs. Gene expression analysis of the brains of offspring mice was carried out with 4 x 44 K whole mouse genome's microarrays (Agilent) on postnatal day 1. The gene expression pattern of the MeHg exposure-group differed from that of the PCB-exposure group. The MeHg + PCB group expressed a larger number of genes, most of which were not expressed in the MeHg group or PCB group. It was revealed that gene expression was greatly increased, and the most altered genes were found with co-exposure. The genes were related to the functional categories of development, inflammation, calcium ion homeostasis, signal transduction, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and detoxication. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and detoxication categories might function for protection against the toxicity induced by co-exposure to MeHg and PCBs. These results suggest that co-exposure does not simply exacerbate the toxicity of MeHg alone or PCB alone, but stimulates a protection system.",M1
20019912,"Exposure to hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-<e>PCBs</e>) in the prenatal period and subsequent neurodevelopment in eastern Slovakia.BACKGROUND: Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), unlike PCBs, are in general readily excreted yet are still detected in humans and animals. Active transport of OH-PCBs across the placenta and hydroxylation of PCBs by the fetus suggest the potential for greater impact on the fetus compared with the parent PCB compounds, but little is known about their health effects, particularly in humans. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between prenatal OH-PCB exposure and neurodevelopment in children at 16 months of age in eastern Slovakia. METHODS: A birth cohort (n = 1,134) was enrolled during 2002-2004. We analyzed six OH-PCB metabolites (4-OH-CB-107, 3-OH-CB-153, 4-OH-CB-146, 3'-OH-CB-138, 4-OH-CB-187, and 4'-OH-CB-172) in a subset of the cohort. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered to the children at the 16-month follow-up visit. We developed multiple linear regression models predicting standardized scores for the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) from maternal (n = 147) and cord (n = 80) serum OH-PCB concentrations, adjusting for sex of child, district, HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment) score, and maternal score on Raven's Progressive Matrices. RESULTS: Cord 4-OH-CB-107 was significantly associated with lower MDI (beta = -2.27; p = 0.01) and PDI (beta = -4.50; p = 0.004). Also, maternal 4-OH-CB-107 was significantly associated with lower MDI (beta = -1.76; p = 0.03) but not PDI. No other OH-PCB metabolites were associated with decreased PDI or MDI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a significant association of 4-OH-CB-107 with decreased MDI, which can possibly be mediated by endocrine disruption, altered neurotransmitter functions, or reduced thyroid hormone concentrations in brain.",M1
20019911,"Predictors of serum dioxins and <e>PCBs</e> among peripubertal Russian boys.BACKGROUND: Although sources and routes of exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been studied, information regarding exposure among children is limited. Breast-feeding and diet are two important contributors to early life exposure. To further understand other significant contributors to childhood exposure, we studied a cohort of children from a city with high environmental dioxin levels. OBJECTIVES: We investigated predictors of serum concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs)/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)/co-planar PCBs (C-PCBs), toxic equivalents (TEQs), and PCBs among 8- to 9-year-old boys in Chapaevsk, Russia. METHODS: We used general linear regression models to explore associations of log(10)-transformed serum concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs/C-PCBs, TEQs, and PCBs at study entry with anthropometric, demographic, geographic, and dietary factors in 482 boys in Chapaevsk, Russia. RESULTS: The median (25th, 75th percentile) concentration for total 2005 TEQs was 21.1 pg/g lipid (14.4, 33.2). Boys who were older, consumed local foods, were breast-fed longer, and whose mothers were employed at the Khimprom chemical plant (where chlorinated chemicals were produced) or gardened locally had significantly higher serum dioxins and PCBs, whereas boys with higher body mass index or more educated parents had significantly lower serum dioxins and PCBs. Boys who lived &lt; 2 km from Khimprom had higher total TEQs (picograms per gram lipid) [adjusted mean = 30.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 26.8-35.0] than boys who lived &gt; 5 km away (adjusted mean = 18.8; 95% CI, 17.2-20.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are specific local sources of dioxin and PCB exposure among children in Chapaevsk including maternal gardening, consumption of locally grown food, and residential proximity to the Khimprom plant.",M1
20019899,"Prediagnostic serum concentrations of organochlorine compounds and risk of testicular germ cell tumors.BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that exposure to organochlorine (OC) compounds, chlordanes and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in particular, may increase the risk of developing testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). OBJECTIVE: To further investigate this question, we conducted a nested case-control study of TGCTs within the Norwegian Janus Serum Bank cohort. METHODS: The study was conducted among individuals with serum collected between 1972 and 1978. TGCT cases diagnosed through 1999 (n = 49; 27-62 years of age at diagnosis) were identified through linkage to the Norwegian Cancer Registry. Controls (n =51) were matched to cases on region, blood draw year, and age at blood draw. Measurements of 11 OC insecticide compounds and 34 polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>) congeners were performed using gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Case-control comparisons of lipid-adjusted analyte concentrations were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for tertiles of analyte concentration were calculated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: TGCT cases had elevated concentrations of p,p'-DDE (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 OR (OR(T3)) 2.2; 95% CI, 0.7-6.5; p(Wilcoxon) = 0.07), oxychlordane (OR(T3) 3.2; 95% CI, 0.6-16.8; p(Wilcoxon) = 0.05), trans-nonachlor (OR(T3) 2.6; 95% CI, 0.7-8.9; p(Wilcoxon) = 0.07), and total chlordanes (OR(T3) 2.0; 95% CI, 0.6-7.2; p(Wilcoxon) = 0.048) compared with controls, although no ORs were statistically significant. Seminoma cases had significantly lower concentrations of PCB congeners 44, 49, and 52 and significantly higher concentrations of PCBs 99, 138, 153, 167, 183, and 195. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides additional but qualified evidence supporting an association between exposures to p,p'-DDE and chlordane compounds, and possibly some PCB congeners, and TGCT risk.",M1
20015547,"Development of ecotoxicoproteomics on the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex: identification of <e>PCB</e> biomarkers in glycolysis and glutamate pathways.PCBs are persistent organic pollutants largely distributed in the biosphere. Although their effects on vertebrates are well described, little is known about their action on freshwater invertebrate's metabolism. Gammarus pulex (Linn√©) was selected as an indicator model to develop a proteomic approach in order to characterize the effects of PCBs on the protein profile of this freshwater crustacean. Sublethal coplanar PCBs exposition and related 2D gel were performed. More than 560 spots were detected and a total of 21 proteins exhibiting significant expression differences in PCB exposed to G. pulex were identified by mass spectrometry. Database searches were conducted to relate the results to well-known metabolic pathways (pentose phosphate, cytoskeleton, energy, etc.). In particular, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and arginine kinase were found to be sensitive to the PCB exposition of G. pulex. The aim of the present study was to assess the biochemical responses and the metabolic changes in G. pulex following intoxication to coplanar PCB congeners CB77 and CB169 by a proteomic approach. This approach allowed us, by the identification of key proteins, to highlight important biochemical mechanisms disturbed by the presence of these contaminants in G. pulex.",M1
20014829,"Potentiation of the human GABA(A) receptor as a novel mode of action of lower-chlorinated non-dioxin-like <e>PCBs</e>.PCBs are still ubiquitous pollutants despite the ban on their industrial and commercial use. To date, risk characterization and assessment of non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs), especially with respect to neurotoxicity, is hampered by a lack of data. Therefore, the effects of six common NDL congeners (PCB28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) on human GABA(A) receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, were investigated using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. When coapplied with GABA (at EC(20)), PCB28 and PCB52 concentration-dependently potentiate the GABA(A) receptor-mediated ion current. Though the LOEC for both PCB28 and PCB52 is 0.3 microM, PCB28 is more potent than PCB52 (maximum potentiation at 10 muM amounting to 98.3 +/- 12.5% and 25.5 +/- 1.4%, respectively). Importantly, coapplication of PCB28 (0.3 microM) and PCB52 (10 microM) resulted in an apparently additive potentiation of the GABA(A) response, whereas coapplication of PCB28 (0.3 microM) and PCB153 (10 microM) attenuated the PCB28-induced potentiation. The present results suggest that the potentiation of human GABA(A) receptor function is specific for lower-chlorinated NDL-PCBs and that higher molecular weight PCBs may attenuate this potentiation as a result of competitive binding to human GABA(A) receptors. Nonetheless, this novel mode of action could (partly) underlie the previously recognized NDL-PCB-induced neurobehavioral alterations.",M1
20004933,"Test burn with <e>PCB</e>-oil in a local cement kiln in Sri Lanka.The production and use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have ceased and most developed countries have disposed off their stocks long time ago. PCBs can however still be found in the environment and one important source is accumulated stocks in developing countries. Sound treatment of PCB is costly and most developing countries do not have dedicated hazardous waste incinerators or non-combustion technologies available for domestic disposal and can usually not afford export. High temperature cement kilns have been used to treat organic hazardous wastes in developed countries for decades and shown to constitute a sound option if well managed and controlled. In contrast to dedicated hazardous waste incinerators and other treatment techniques, cement kilns are already in place in virtually every country and may constitute a treatment option. The objective of this study was therefore to carry out the first test burn with PCB-oil in a developing country cement kiln and to assess its feasibility and destruction performance. The 3 d test burn demonstrated that the Sri Lankan cement kiln was able to destroy PCB in an irreversible and environmental sound manner without causing any new formation of PCDD/PCDF or HCB. The destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) was better than 99.9999% at the highest PCB feeding rate.",M1
19999978,"Oxidative stress and apoptosis of Carassius auratus lymphocytes induced by nonplanar (PCB153) and coplanar (PCB169) polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in vitro.Among all the 209 kinds of polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCBs</e>) congeners, nonplanar and coplanar PCB congeners have different levels of toxicity on mammal cells such as neuronal cells, but little is known about their toxicity on fish cells although PCB congeners usually have high bioaccumulation abilities in the detected fish bodies. This study showed that 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexacholorbiphenyl (PCB153, nonplanar congener) and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexacholorbiphenyl (PCB 169, coplanar congener) caused apoptosis on the isolated crucian carp (Carassius auratus) lymphocytes and the induced cytotoxicity was structure-dependent. According to the laser confocal microscope observations, apoptosis was clearly distinguished by condensation of nucleus, shrinkage and formation of apoptotic bodies. DNA fragmentation was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. These typical morphological and biochemical characteristics indicate the occurrence of apoptosis on fish lymphocytes. According to the flow cytometry analysis, after the cells were exposed to 10 micromol/L PCBs for 3 h, the apoptotic percentage induced by PCB153 was 23.41%, while that induced by PCB169 was even higher (31.03%). Furthermore, incubating PCBs with fish lymphocytes enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), clearly indicating the presence of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Our data also demonstrate that the different cytotoxic effects induced by coplanar and nonplanar PCBs were correlated with their structural characteristics and the coplanar congener was more cytotoxic than nonplanar congener. This study suggests that cytotoxicity mechanisms of the PCB congeners on fish lymphocytes depend on their planarity and chemical structures.",M1
19995667,"Enhanced removal of polychlorinated biphenyls from alfalfa rhizosphere soil in a field study: the impact of a rhizobial inoculum.Polychlorinated biphenyls (<e>PCB</e>) are persistent pollutants in soil environments where they continue to present considerable human health risks. Successful strategies to remediate contaminated soils are needed that are effective and of low cost. Bioremediation approaches that include the use of plants and microbial communities to promote degradation of PCB have significant potential but need further assessment under field conditions. The effects of growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and inoculation with a symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacterium (Rhizobium meliloti) on the removal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) from rhizosphere soil were evaluated in a field experiment. The initial PCB content of the soil ranged from 414 to 498 microg kg(-)(1). PCB removal for the rhizosphere soil was enhanced in the planted treatments, an average of 36% decrease in PCB levels compared to a 5.4% decrease in the unplanted soil, and further enhanced when plants were inoculated with the symbiotic Rhizobium (an average of 43% decrease) when evaluated at 90 days after planting. Plant biomass production was higher in the inoculated treatment. The total PCB content was increased from 3.30 microg kg(-)(1) to 26.72 microg kg(-)(1) in plant shoots, and from 115.07 microg kg(-)(1) to 142.23 microg kg(-)(1) in roots in the inoculated treatment compared to the planted treatment. Increased colony forming units (cfu) of total heterotrophic bacteria, biphenyl-degrading bacteria and fungi were observed in the rhizosphere of inoculated plants. PCB removal from the rhizosphere soil was not significantly correlated with the direct PCB uptake by the plants in any of the treatments but was significantly correlated with the stimulation of rhizosphere microflora. Changes in the soil microbial community structure in the planted and inoculated treatment were observed by profiling of bacterial ribosomal sequences. Some bacteria, such as Flavobacterium sp., may have contributed to the effective degradation of PCB and deserve further investigation.",M1
17576523,"Salvage chemotherapy with procarbazine and fotemustine combination in the treatment of temozolomide treated recurrent glioblastoma patients.The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of Procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) and fotemustine (FTM) combination in the treatment of pre-temozolomide treated, recurrent GBM patients. The primary end-point was progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6). Secondary end-points were overall survival, response rates (CR + PR) and toxicity. About 54 patients (41 men and 13 women) aged 26-68 years (median age, 53.5 years) with recurrent GBM were treated. PCB was administered as an oral dosage of 450 mg on days 1-2 and a total dose of 300 mg on day 3. FTM was administered on day 3, 3 h after the last PCB intake at a dose of 110 mg/mq/BSA. The treatment was repeated every 5 weeks. Treatment was continued for a maximum of six cycles or until disease progression. After two cycles of chemotherapy: 6 patients (11.2%) experienced a neuroradiographic partial response (PR), 29 patients (53.7%) had stable disease (SD), and 19 patients (35.1%) had progressive disease (PD). For the whole group of patients, the median PFS was 19.3 weeks (95% CI, 14.1-24.4 weeks), and PFS-6 was 26.7% (95% CI, 10.6-42.8%). Overall MST from the beginning of PCB + FTM chemotherapy was 28.7 weeks (95% CI, 24.8-32.7 weeks). At 6 and 12 months, 64.4% (95% CI, 51.5-77.3%) and 23.6% (95% CI, 10.1-37.1%) of patients were alive. The median survival time calculated from the first diagnosis was 20.8 months (95% CI, 16.7-24.8). We concluded that the PCB + FTM combination as done in the current trial for patients with recurrent GBM after treatment with TMZ showed some benefit with regards to increased survival and that a Phase III trial is warranted.",M2
16951236,"The effect of enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs on the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of procarbazine hydrochloride.PURPOSE: Procarbazine hydrochloride (<e>PCB</e>) is one of the few anticancer drugs with activity against high-grade gliomas. This study was conducted to determine if the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of PCB are affected by the concurrent use of enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs (EIASD). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adults with recurrent high-grade glioma were divided into cohorts who were (+) and were not (-) taking EIASDs. PCB was given orally for 5 consecutive days each month. Six patients were evaluated at each dose level beginning with 200 mg/m2/d and escalated using the modified continual reassessment method. Toxicity and response were assessed. Pharmacokinetic studies were done with a new electrospray ionization mass spectrometry assay. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were evaluated. The maximum tolerated dose was 393 mg/m2/d for the +EIASD group and the highest dose evaluated in -EIASD patients was 334 mg/m2/d. Myelosuppression was the primary dose-limiting toxicity. Significant hepatic dysfunction occurred in three patients in the +EIASD cohort. Four partial responses (8%) and no complete responses were observed. PCB exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with no significant differences between the two cohorts. A marked increase in peak PCB levels was noted on day 5 relative to day 1, which was not attributable to drug accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that (a) EIASD use does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of PCB; (b) changes in the peak plasma concentration of PCB, consistent with decreased apparent oral clearance due to autoinhibition of hepatic metabolism, occur with daily dosing; and (c) severe hepatic dysfunction may accompany this administration schedule.",M2
16317293,"Plasma kinetics of procarbazine and azo-procarbazine in humans.The plasma kinetics of procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) and its major metabolite azo-procarbazine (azo-PCB) were systematically investigated in humans for the first time. Eight therapy-refractory tumor patients with normal liver and renal function were given a single oral dose of 300 mg PCB hydrochloride as a drinking solution under fasting conditions. With the exception of the single i.v. administration of 10 mg ondansetron hydrochloride immediately before the administration of PCB, the patients were free of any co-medication 4 weeks before and during the study. PCB and azo-PCB were determined by a specially developed HPLC-UV method. PCB was absorbed very rapidly. Mean maximum plasma concentration was 12.5 min. A high elimination rate of PCB from plasma was found. The mean apparent oral systemic clearance and the plasma elimination half-life were estimated at 35.8 l/min and 9.2 min, respectively. Considerable amounts of azo-PCB are found in the plasma of the eight tumor patients. The mean Cmax and AUC ratios of azo-PCB/PCB were estimated at 5.5 and 45.2. Azo-PCB is formed very rapidly from PCB, but eliminated much more slowly from plasma than PCB. Considerable interindividual differences in the conversion rate of azo-PCB to its further metabolites were observed which should have consequences for the individual tumor therapeutic efficiency of PCB. No toxic side-effects or symptoms such as nausea or vomiting were observed during the entire study.",M2
16302731,"Efficacy and feasibility of procarbazine, ranimustine and vincristine chemotherapy, and the role of surgical resection in anaplastic oligodendroglioma.The safety, tolerance and preliminary efficacy of a chemotherapy regimen consisting of procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>), ranimustine (MCNU) and vincristine (VCR) were assessed for patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial anaplastic oligodendroglioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and September 2003, 5 patients were enrolled. The initial regimens were prescribed as adjuvant therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment. All patients received a chemotherapy comprising ranimustine (100 mg/m2) intravenously on Day 1, procarbazine (60 mg/m2) on Days 8 to 21, and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2, maximum total 2 mg) on Days 8 and 29. The cycles were repeated every 8 weeks until tumor progression was evident, or for a total of 6 cycles over a 1-year period. The primary end-points were safety and tolerability, while the secondary end-point was overall survival. RESULTS: Five consecutive eligible patients were treated. Of the 4 evaluable patients, 3 partially responded to the treatment (PR), while 1 had a complete response (CR): all patients are still alive. However, 3 of the 5 patients showed relapse, with a time to tumor progression (TTP) of 50, 143 and 241 weeks, respectively. Two of these patients received combined treatment with carboplatin, etoposide and recombinant human mutant tumor necrosis factor-alpha at the first relapse. This regimen appeared to be safe and neither neurological toxicity, severe or life-threatening hematological toxicity, nor fatal toxicity (WHO Grade 4) were experienced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a chemotherapy regimen consisting of PCB, MCNU and VCR in this patient population seems to be safe and tolerable, and the response rate was high. Thus, wide resection with a risk of major neurological morbidity due to nearby functionally critical areas can be avoided. However, since the relapse rate was high, a second-line chemotherapy should be developed for anaplastic oligodendroglioma to improve the long-term control of the disease.",M2
15315798,"Procarbazine in haematology: an old drug with a new life?Procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) was developed in the 1960s and was rapidly recognised as an active agent in lymphoid malignancies. PCB was one of the four drugs combined in mechlorethamine, vincristine, PCB, prednisolone (MOPP), one of the first combination chemotherapy regimens to show that advanced-stage disease could be cured in humans. During the last few decades, comprehensive studies have clarified cellular pathways involved in the modes of action of PCB and its drug resistance mechanisms. However, late toxicities, especially secondary leukaemias and sterility, led to its withdrawal from combination regimens used to treat Hodgkin's lymphomas (HLs). PCB was recently reintroduced in dose-intensified regimens and yielded impressive results. These new regimens (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, PCB, and prednisone (BEACOPP) or escalated BEACOPP) are now being investigated versus the classic ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) or ABVD-like combination chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of HLs.",M2
12865911,"Phase I study of temozolamide (TMZ) combined with procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) in patients with gliomas.Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent with a good safety profile and proven efficacy in the treatment of malignant glioma. Procarbazine (PCB) has been used for treating gliomas for many years and here both agents were combined in the treatment. This phase I study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMZ alone (course 1) and TMZ in combination with PCB in subsequent courses in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with malignant glioma. Patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma were treated with TMZ 200 mg m(-2) on days 1-5 on a 28-day cycle for course 1. Beginning with course 2, cohorts of patients received TMZ at full dose with escalating doses of PCB (50/75/100/125 mg m(-2) days 1-5 given 1 h prior to TMZ). A total of 28 patients were enrolled with three patients each at dose level 1 and 2, 16 patients at dose level 3 and six patients at dose level 4 received 182+ cycles of treatment and were included in this analysis. In all, 16 patients had GBM, seven patients had AA, five had grade 1 or 2 glioma and the median age was 47 years. The patients had received prior surgery and radiotherapy. Responses were seen at all dose levels. Overall, there were 10 (36%) responses lasting from 2 to 17+ months. Treatment was generally well tolerated with few grade 3 or 4 toxicities, except at dose level 4, where four patients had grade 3/4 had thrombocytopaenia at this dose and several patients had moderate-to-severe lethargy. TMZ 200 mg m(-2) and PCB 100 mg m(-2) were well tolerated on a daily 5 x and four weekly cycle in patients with malignant glioma and clearly had antitumour activity.",M2
11868631,"Procarbazine effects on spermatogenesis in golden hamster: a flow cytometric evaluation.The response of hamster testis to the administration of 450mg/kg procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) over a period of 4 weeks was evaluated. Flow cytometry was used to investigate changes in cell populations in testicular single cell suspensions and to correlate these changes with those observed in histological sections. PCB caused significant decrease in testicular and epididymal weight and a drastic reduction in haploid cells and spermatogenic arrest, demonstrating variation among the test animals. The results obtained confirm previous observations concerning detrimental effects of PCB upon spermatogenesis in species such as the rat and mouse, though its effect on hamster testis is milder and does not include the germinal stem cells. The histological evaluation of the testis showed a good correlation with flow cytometric evaluation, emphasizing the usefulness of this method in providing quantitative and rapid results.",M2
11313116,"Anti-genotoxicity of trans-anethole and eugenol in mice.The naturally occurring flavouring agents trans-anethole and eugenol were evaluated for antigenotoxic effects in mice. The test doses of trans-anethole (40-400 mg/kg body weight) and eugenol (50-500 mg/kg weight) were administered by gavage 2 and 20 h before the genotoxins were injected intraperitoneally. Anti-genotoxic effects were assessed in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Pretreatment with trans-anethole and eugenol led to significant antigenotoxic effects against cyclophosphamide (CPH), procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and urethane (URE). In addition, trans-anethole inhibited the genotoxicity of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). Both trans-anethole and eugenol exerted dose-related antigenotoxic effects against PCB and URE. There was no significant increase in genotoxicity when trans-anethole (40-400 mg/kg body weight) and eugenol (50-500 mg/kg body weight) were administered alone.",M2
11000577,"Chemosensitivity in childhood brain tumours in vitro: evidence of differential sensitivity to lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine.The aim of this study was to examine the range of sensitivity of a panel of short-term cultures derived from different types of malignant childhood brain tumours including medulloblastoma, ependymoma and glioblastoma multiforme to three cytotoxic drugs, lomustine (CCNU), vincristine (VCR) and procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>). Sensitivity was assessed using a modification of the dimethylthiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Short-term cell lines derived from ependymomas were considerably more resistant to VCR than other types of childhood brain tumours, while cultures derived from supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) displayed marked sensitivity to both lomustine and VCR. Cultures from ependymomas, medulloblastoma and astrocytic gliomas had similar sensitivity to lomustine and PCB as cultures derived from adult malignant astrocytoma.",M2
10944597,"A phase II study of temozolomide vs. procarbazine in patients with glioblastoma multiforme at first relapse.A randomized, multicentre, open-label, phase II study compared temozolomide (TMZ), an oral second-generation alkylating agent, and procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) in 225 patients with glioblastoma multiforme at first relapse. Primary objectives were to determine progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and safety for TMZ and PCB in adult patients who failed conventional treatment. Secondary objectives were to assess overall survival and health-related quality of life (HRQL). TMZ was given orally at 200 mg/m(2)/day or 150 mg/m(2)/day (prior chemotherapy) for 5 days, repeated every 28 days. PCB was given orally at 150 mg/m(2)/day or 125 mg/m(2)/day (prior chemotherapy) for 28 days, repeated every 56 days. HRQL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 [+3]) and the Brain Cancer Module 20 (BCM20). The 6-month PFS rate for patients who received TMZ was 21%, which met the protocol objective. The 6-month PFS rate for those who received PCB was 8% (P = 0.008, for the comparison). Overall PFS significantly improved with TMZ, with a median PFS of 12.4 weeks in the TMZ group and 8.32 weeks in the PCB group (P = 0.0063). The 6-month overall survival rate for TMZ patients was 60% vs. 44% for PCB patients (P = 0.019). Freedom from disease progression was associated with maintenance of HRQL, regardless of treatment received. TMZ had an acceptable safety profile; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.",M2
10735896,"Health-related quality of life in patients treated with temozolomide versus procarbazine for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.PURPOSE: To determine whether chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) versus procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was associated with improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: HRQOL was assessed at baseline and during treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and a Brain Cancer Module (BCM20) in two clinical trials that enrolled a total of 366 patients. Two hundred eighty-eight patients provided HRQOL data that could be used for analysis; 109 patients received TMZ in a phase II study, whereas 89 patients received TMZ and 90 received PCB in a randomized phase III study. Changes from baseline in the scores of seven preselected HRQOL domains (role and social functioning, global quality of life [QOL], visual disorders, motor dysfunction, communication deficit, and drowsiness) were calculated for all groups. Statistical significance, effect sizes, and proportions of patients with improved HRQOL scores (changes of &gt; or = 10 points) were calculated. RESULTS: Before disease progression, patients treated with TMZ were found to have an improvement in most of the preselected HRQOL domain scores compared with their baseline (pretreatment) scores. Those who were progression-free on TMZ at 6 months had improvement in all the preselected HRQOL domains. Conversely, patients treated with PCB reported deterioration in HRQOL that was independent of whether or not the disease had progressed by 6 months. Patients with disease progression, regardless of treatment, experienced a sharp decline in all domains at the time of progression. CONCLUSION: Treatment with TMZ was associated with improvement in HRQOL scores compared with treatment with PCB. The deterioration reported by PCB-treated patients was likely because of toxicity. Delaying disease progression by treatment with TMZ is beneficial to the HRQOL status of patients with recurrent GBM.",M2
10622452,"The effects of anticancer drugs in combination with nimodipine and verapamil on cultured cells of glioblastoma multiforme.The presence of the cellular multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene and its product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), is thought to be a mechanism for the failure of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Calcium channel blockers have been shown to sensitise cancer cells to anticancer drugs by reversing Pgp expression in cell lines. The interactions between anticancer drugs such as carmustine (BCNU), vincristine (VCR) and procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) and calcium channel blockers such as nimodipine and verapamil on cultured cells of glioblastoma from eight patients were therefore tested. Pgp expression was examined immunohistochemically using C219 monoclonal antibody in cytospin preparation. The cytotoxicity of the drugs was screened using microculture tetrazolium assay. The cells from five patients showed positive immunoreaction for Pgp. Nimodipine showed growth-inhibitory activity against glioblastoma cells at a rate of 16.55-26.88% (P &lt; 0.05), but a similar effect was not observed with verapamil. While antiproliferative effects of BCNU were around 20.91-45.09% (P &lt; 0.05) on the cells from seven patients, VCR was the most effective agent in inhibition of cell growth at a rate of 26.43-48.47% (P &lt; 0.05). The response of the cells from five patients to PCB was from 11.98 to 16.32% (P &lt; 0.05). When used together, nimodipine further enriched cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs up to 11.14-40.85% (P &lt; 0.05) without relation to Pgp expression. In conclusion, the enhancement of cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs by nimodipine suggests that there might be a synergy between anticancer drugs and nimodipine in the inhibition of glioma cell growth.",M2
10080610,"Procarbazine and high-dose tamoxifen as a second-line regimen in recurrent high-grade gliomas: a phase II study.PURPOSE: A phase II study was conducted in patients with high-grade gliomas that recurred after surgery plus radiotherapy and a first-line nitrosourea-based regimen. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) combined with high-dose tamoxifen in relation to tumor control, toxicity, and time to progression (TTP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients were treated with procarbazine in repeated 30-day courses at 100 mg/m2/d plus tamoxifen 100 mg/d, with a 30-day interval between courses. Thirty-four patients had been pretreated with a first-line nitrosourea-based chemotherapy regimen (group A), and 19 patients had also been pretreated with a second-line chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin and teniposide (group B). Twenty-one of the patients had also been procarbazine pretreated, whereas the remaining 32 patients were not procarbazine pretreated. RESULTS: The response was assessed in 51 patients, 28 of whom had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 23 of whom had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). There were two complete responses (CR) (4%) and 13 partial responses (PR) (25.5%). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 29.5% (SE, 6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23 to 35.8). Seventeen patients (32%) had stable disease (SE, 6.2; 95% CI, 21 to 33.6). The median TTP was 13 weeks for patients with GBM and 33 weeks for patients with AA (P = .006). The median survival time (MST) was 27 weeks for patients with GBM and 57 weeks for those with AA (P = .006). CONCLUSION: Combined PCB and tamoxifen as a second-line regimen gave a reasonably high response rate in patients with heavily pretreated high-grade gliomas. However, although it resulted in an improvement in the patients' quality of life and/or performance status, it was not followed by an increased TTP or MST.",M2
7819047,"Clomiphene citrate reduces procarbazine-induced sterility in a rat model.Chemotherapy with the cytotoxic drug procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) causes permanent infertility in most male patients. Since many patients treated with this cytotoxic drug are of reproductive age, it is important to develop a method to protect spermatogenesis and fertility. It has been hypothesised that 'spermatogenic arrest' by pharmacological intervention may render the testes less susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. The present study investigated whether recovery of fertility in a male rat model could be achieved by suppression of spermatogenesis with high doses of clomiphene citrate (CC) prior to PCB administration. It was demonstrated that young male rats treated with a combination of CC and PCB partially recovered spermatogenesis and achieved almost normal fertility. In contrast, animals treated with PCB alone exhibited abnormal spermatogenesis and remained infertile.",M2
8360711,"Comparison between BCNU and procarbazine chemotherapy for treatment of gliomas.We compared sequential single-agent BCNU and procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) chemotherapy in 31 patients with gliomas [grade IV (10), grade III (15), grade II (6)]. Patients had failed surgical biopsy +/- resection and radiation therapy. All patients were treated initially with BCNU 150-300 mg/m2 by intra-arterial or intravenous route every 6 weeks. After CT evidence of tumor progression, all patients received PCB 150 mg/m2/day for 28 days every 8 weeks. Patient responses to BCNU were CR (0), PR (7), SD (12), progression (12), and to PCB CR (2), PR (9), SD (6), and progression (14). Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time to failure for all patients were shorter for BCNU, 5.0 months (range 1.5-20), than for PCB, 6.0 months (range 2-50+). There was a statistically significant difference (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.02) in the distribution of time to disease progression between the two drugs, especially for grade III tumors (p = 0.02). The cumulative proportion of patients without disease progression at 6 months was 26% while on BCNU, compared to 48% while on PCB; at 12 months the cumulative proportions were 3% for BCNU compared to 35% for PCB. Although there was no formal washout period between administration of the two drugs, no carryover effect was evident. These data provide further evidence that PCB has significant activity against malignant glioma and may, in fact, be more effective than BCNU.",M2

We treated 35 patients with recurrent malignant astrocytomas after radiation and nitrosourea failure with successive courses of PCB 150 mg/m2/d for 28 days every 8 weeks. After 2 courses, 2 patients had complete responses, 7 had partial responses, 11 had stable disease, and 15 had progression. Significantly more patients receiving PCB had complete or partial responses or stable disease than a similar group of patients in a previous trial who received intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin (DDP). There is a significant advantage in time to disease progression for those receiving PCB compared with those receiving IA diaziquone (AZQ). Our results suggest that PCB is a more effective 2nd agent than IA DDP or AZQ following radiation and nitrosourea failure.",M2
2687629,"Comparative genotoxicities of procarbazine and two deuterated analogs in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo.N-isopropyl-alpha-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide hydrochloride (procarbazine; 50-1000 micrograms/ml) induced DNA damage in hepatocytes measured by an automated alkaline elution method, whereas no significant increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis was seen. In hepatocytes isolated from <e>PCB</e>-treated rats, DNA damage was detected in both test systems at concentrations as low as 1-10 micrograms/ml. DNA damage, as measured by alkaline elution and sister-chromatid exchange(s), was observed also in V79 cells incubated with PCB-hepatocytes. In contrast, no mutagenic activity was observed in the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1530 co-incubated with the hepatocytes. Exposure of rats to low doses of procarbazine (25-50 mg/kg) caused DNA damage measured by alkaline elution in liver and testis, with the liver being somewhat more sensitive. The genotoxicity caused by procarbazine was increased by a factor of 2-3 in both organs by PCB-treatment of the rats. N-isopropyl-alpha-(2-methyl-hydrazino)-p-[alpha,alpha-2H2]toluamide (d2-procarbazine), was found to cause significantly less genotoxicity in control rats than either procarbazine itself, or N-isopropyl-alpha-(2-[alpha,alpha,alpha-2H3]methylhydrazino)-p-tol uamide (d3-procarbazine). This indicates that benzylic C-H oxidation of procarbazine is an important step in the activation of procarbazine to genotoxic metabolites in uninduced rats.",M2
3134124,"Partial prevention of procarbazine induced germinal cell aplasia in rats by sequential GnRH antagonist and testosterone administration.The present study examined the feasibility of using a combination of gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-A) and testosterone in the prevention of procarbazine induced germinal aplasia. Daily injections of GnRH-A or vehicle were given to adult male rats for 21 days prior to procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) administration and continued until 2 days after the second of two doses of procarbazine (200 mg/kg i.p.) given 1 week apart. One group of rats receiving GnRH-A and PCB was given s.c. two 5-cm testosterone capsule (TC) implants (inside diameter, 3.5 mm) immediately following the second dose of PCB. Eight weeks after the last PCB treatment, more than 99% of the seminiferous tubular cross-sections of rats receiving PCB alone were devoid of spermatogenic activity. Spermatogenesis in PCB injected animals receiving GnRH-A pretreatment alone was abortive but was partially preserved when exogenous testosterone was given following PCB administration. At 16 weeks, spermatogenesis was absent in all PCB treated animals and was only observed in less than 1% of the tubular cross-sections of the PCB treated rats receiving GnRH-A pretreatment alone. On the other hand, active spermatogenesis was noted in 68% of the tubular cross-sections, and complete spermatogenesis was noted in four of the five PCB treated rats receiving both GnRH-A pretreatment and subsequent TC implantation. At the time of sacrifice, testicular testosterone concentrations in animals receiving TC implants were below 10% of normal levels, while both serum and testicular testosterone content were increased in PCB treated animals with or without GnRH-A pretreatment. Concomitantly, testicular androgen binding protein content remained suppressed and serum androgen binding protein was elevated, indicating a prolonged defect in Sertoli cell function. These lesions were prevented by GnRH-A pretreatment. The present study demonstrates that GnRH-A pretreatment and subsequent TC implantation resulted in restoration of complete spermatogenesis in adult male rats given a 400-mg/kg cumulative dose of PCB. It is postulated that GnRH-A may ameliorate PCB induced Sertoli cell dysfunction and/or stimulate the number of spermatogonia to provide more proliferating cells ready for repopulation of the germinal epithelium following PCB injury. The differentiation of these spermatogonia was further supported by exogenous testosterone through certain unknown local mechanisms, resulting in the completion of spermatogenesis.",M2

Ten weeks' pretreatment of the rats with 200 mm2 silastic implants containing testosterone resulted in significant protection of the spermatogonial stem cells from PCB-induced damage. Androgen-pretreated rats given a single dose of 200 mg/kg PCB demonstrated 86% tubule regeneration as opposed to 41% in rats pretreated with cholesterol. Similar values were obtained when the PCB dose was given as two weekly fractions of 100 mg/kg.

Drug doses (carmustine (BCNU), 15 mg/kg; cyclophosphamide (CY), 150 mg/kg; procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>), 200 mg/kg) were chosen to kill a high proportion of differentiated spermatogonia but few stem-cells, as assessed by sperm-head counts (SHC) at 29 and 56 days respectively. Drug doses were administered up to 14 days prior to or after local irradiation with 9 Gy of 230 kVp X-rays. BCNU produced a moderate enhancement of damage that was relatively independent of time. Both CY and PCB produced a considerable enhancement of damage especially when administered 1 to 3 days before irradiation. Enhancement in the case of PCB consisted largely of a vertical displacement of the radiation dose-response curves, but with additional evidence for possible changes in slope.",M2

The chemotherapy regimens were: carmustine (BCNU)--80 mg/m2 iv daily X 3 every 6 weeks; procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>)--100 mg/m2 orally; or dacarbazine (DTIC)--175 mg/m2 iv daily X 5 every 4 weeks. Patients were stratified according to age, and degree of resection, with no differences identified between groups. The response rates (complete plus partial) for BCNU and DTIC were significantly better than for PCB [BCNU, 39%; PCB, 13%; and DTIC, 38% (P less than 0.01)]. The response duration and survival were somewhat better in patients treated with BCNU and DTIC, but compared to patients treated with PCB, the difference was not statistically significant. Median survival times were: BCNU, 45 weeks; PCB, 31 weeks; and DTIC, 49 weeks (P greater than 0.3). There were six toxic deaths with BCNU and four with PCB, most of which were due to infection associated with leukopenia. The high toxicity and minimal benefit of chemotherapy added to radiotherapy compared to historical results with radiotherapy alone suggest that combined treatment may not be indicated for some patients.",M2

Cell cultures were prepared from 40 patients in this series and their sensitivity to each cytotoxic drug was assessed in a mictotitration assay with 35 S-methionine incorporation as the end point. Twenty-two of forty (55%) patients responded to PCB and/or CCNU in vitro, and sensitivity to these drugs was linked with increased RFI, whilst sensitivity to VCR was not. The RFI of patients who had responded to PCB or CCNU in vitro was significantly longer than the RFI of patients whose tumours failed to respond in vitro or patients who had not been tested. There was no difference in sex ratio, extent of operation, radiation dose and degree of steroid cover between responders, non-responders and untested groups. Grade III tumours tended to be more sensitive in vitro than grade IV tumours. The age of patients also influenced in vitro chemosensitivity. Patients with chemosensitive tumours in vitro tended to be younger than patients with insensitive tumours in vitro. Further statistical analysis, taking into account these prognostic factors, indicated an association between chemosensitivity in vitro and RFI.",M2

Three of the lines (D-54 MG, U-118 MG, and U-251 MG) were derived from permanent human glioma cell lines, while the other two lines (N-456 and N-519) were established as direct xenografts in mice. Growth rates varied among the lines, but all were treated at a common average tumor volume of 200-300 mm3. Three drugs of known clinical activity against human anaplastic glial tumors were tested in this system. Procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) produced significant responses in all five tumor lines, carmustine produced significant growth delays in two, and mithramycin produced a slight growth delay in only one. A carmustine-PCB combination produced a greater therapeutic effect than either agent alone against D-54 MG, but the combination was no more effective than PCB alone against U-118 MG. These results parallel clinical experience and indicate that this is a useful model for testing agents of potential activity in brain tumor therapy.",M2

6835229,"Induction of sister-chromatid exchanges by chemotherapeutic drugs in spermatogonia of mice: effects of procarbazine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and mitomycin C.The chemotherapeutic drugs procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>), adriamycin (ADR), cyclophosphamide (CP) and mitomycin C (MMC) were evaluated in vivo for induction of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in differentiating spermatogonia of mice. There was a dose-dependent increase in SCE induced by the drugs. The lowest doses that enhanced the SCE rate to greater than twice baseline frequency were: 10 (PCB), 0.25 (ADR), 5 (CP) and 0.25 (MMC) mg/kg body weight. Based on the x-fold increase in SCE over baseline frequency, induced by the highest test dose (which permitted analysis of SCE), the drugs evaluated were ranked as follows: CP greater than MMC greater than PCB greater than ADR. The persistence of SCE-inducing lesions in spermatogonia was investigated by giving a treatment of CP (20 mg/kg body weight), 6 and 9 days before completion of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) administration. Within 6-9 days, the SCE rate returned to the baseline level.",M2
7001223,"Detection of mutagenicity of procarbazine by the host-mediated assay with polychlorinated biphenyl (aroclor 1254) as enzyme inducer.Procarbazine [N-isoppropyl-alpha-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide] was tested for mutagenicity with Salmonella typhimurium G46 in the host-mediated assay by using male BALB/c mice pretreated orally with polychlorinated biphenyl (<e>PCB</e>, Aroclor 1254). Procarbazine was weakly mutagenic without PCB pretreatment, but the pretreatment greatly enhanced the mutagenicity of this compound. The administration of 500 mg PCB/kg 1 day before procarbazine dosage was suitable for the detection of the mutagenicity. Among PCB, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and phenobarbital sodium (PB), the former 2 inducers showed much stronger enhancing effects than PB. The pretreatment with 3-MC in combination with PB did not cause further enhancement compared with 3-MC alone.",M2
321233,"Bone marrow transplantation for an infant with neutrophil dysfunction.A child with severe neutrophil dysfunction and intractable infections received bone marrow transplants from histocompatible siblings. After a first transplant preceded by cyclophosphamide (CY), antithymocyte serum (ATS) and procarbazine (<e>PCB</e>) preconditioning, there was no evidence for engraftment and autologous marrow function rapidly returned. Cell mediated lysis showed no evidence of patient sensitization against the marrow donor suggesting that graft rejection did not cause the transplant failure. A second transplant was performed utilizing another matched sibling donor. Total body irradiation was added to CY, ATS, and PCB for preconditioning after in vitro studies of the colony forming capacity (CFUc) of the patient's marrow cells showed normal sensitivity to radiation. Full engraftment ensued with correction of granulocyte function abnormalities. The patient eventually died of intractable pulmonary disease. Our experience with this child suggests that cyclophosphamide alone may be insufficient preparation for marrow transplantation in some patients with non-neoplastic hematologic disorders. Experimental and clinical data supporting this contention are reviewed.",M2
