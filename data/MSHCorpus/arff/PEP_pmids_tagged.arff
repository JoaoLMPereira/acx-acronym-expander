19942662,"sigma54-Mediated control of the mannose phosphotransferase sytem in Lactobacillus plantarum impacts on carbohydrate metabolism.Sigma factors direct specific binding of the bacterial RNA polymerase to the promoter. Here we present the elucidation of the sigma(54 ) regulon in Lactobacillus plantarum. A sequence-based regulon prediction of sigma(54)-dependent promoters revealed an operon encoding a mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS) as the best candidate for sigma(54)-mediated control. A sigma (54) (rpoN) mutant derivative did not grow on mannose, confirming this prediction. Additional mutational analyses established the presence of one functional mannose PTS in L. plantarum, the expression of which is controlled by sigma(54) in concert with the sigma(54)-activator ManR. Genome-wide transcription comparison of the wild-type and the rpoN-deletion strain revealed nine upregulated genes in the wild-type, including the genes of the mannose PTS, and 21 upregulated genes in the rpoN mutant. The sigma(54)-controlled mannose PTS was shown also to transport glucose in L. plantarum wild-type cells, and its presence causes a lag phase when cultures are transferred from glucose- to galactose-containing media. The mannose PTS appeared to drain phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) pools in resting cells, since no PEP could be detected in resting wild-type cells, while mannose PTS mutant derivatives contained 1-3 muM PEP (mg protein)(-1 ). Our data provide new insight into the role of sigma( 54) in L. plantarum and possibly other Gram-positive bacteria in the control of expression of an important glucose transporter that contributes to glucose-mediated catabolite control via modulation of the PEP pool.",M1
19905012,"Disentangling the web of allosteric communication in a homotetramer: heterotropic inhibition in phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli.This study quantifies the contribution of each of the four unique inhibiting heterotropic interactions between the allosteric inhibitor, phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), and the substrate, fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), in phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli (EcPFK). The unique heterotropic interactions, previously labeled by the distances between ligand binding sites, were isolated independently by constructing hybrid tetramers. Of the four unique heterotropic PEP-Fru-6-P interactions, the 45 A interaction contributed 25%, the 30 A interaction contributed 31%, and the 23 A interaction contributed 42% of the total PEP inhibition. The 33 A interaction actually causes a small activation of Fru-6-P binding by PEP and therefore contributed -8% of the total observed PEP inhibition. The pattern of relative contribution to PEP inhibition from each interaction in EcPFK does not follow the same pattern seen in MgADP activation of EcPFK. This observation supports the conclusion that although PEP and MgADP bind to the same site, they do not use the same communication pathways to influence the active site. The pattern of relative contribution describing PEP inhibition observed in this study also does not follow the pattern determined for PEP inhibition in phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, suggesting that these two highly homologous isoforms are not inhibited in the same manner by PEP.",M1
19891460,"The energy landscape of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase.3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase catalyzes the condensation of arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) to form KDO8P, a key precursor in the biosynthesis of the endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria. Earlier studies have established that the condensation occurs with a syn addition of water to the si side of C2(PEP) and of C3(PEP) to the re side of C1(A5P). Two stepwise mechanisms have been proposed for this reaction. One involves a transient carbanion intermediate, formed by attack of water or a hydroxide ion on C2(PEP). The other involves a transient oxocarbenium zwitterionic intermediate, formed by direct attack of C3(PEP) onto C1(A5P), followed by reaction of water at C2. In both cases, the transient intermediates are expected to converge to a more stable tetrahedral intermediate, which decays into KDO8P and inorganic phosphate. In this study we calculated the potential energy surfaces (PESs) associated with all possible reaction paths in the active site of KDO8PS: the path involving a syn addition of water to the si side of C2(PEP) and of C3(PEP) to the re side of C1(A5P), with the PEP phosphate group deprotonated, has the lowest energy barrier ( approximately 14 kcal/mol) and is strongly exoergonic (reaction energy of -38 kcal/mol). Consistent with the experimental observations, other potential reaction paths, like an anti addition of water to the re side of C2(PEP) or addition of C3(PEP) to the si side of C1(A5P), are associated with much higher barriers. An important new finding of this study is that the lowest energy reaction path does not correspond to either one of the pure stepwise mechanisms proposed formerly but can be described instead as a partially concerted reaction between PEP, A5P, and water. The success in using PESs to reproduce established features of the reaction and to discriminate between different mechanisms suggests that this approach may be of general utility in the study of other enzymatic reactions.",M1
19800933,"The quaternary structure of pyruvate kinase type 1 from Escherichia coli at low nanomolar concentrations.Pyruvate kinase (PK) is the key control point of glycolysis-the biochemical pathway central to energy metabolism and the production of precursors used in biosynthesis. PK type 1 from Escherichia coli (Ec-PK1) is activated by both fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and its substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>). To date, it has not been possible to determine whether the enzyme is tetrameric at the low concentrations (i.e. low nM range) used to study the steady-state kinetics, or assess whether its allosteric effectors alter the oligomeric state of the enzyme at these concentrations. Employing the new technique of analytical ultracentrifugation with fluorescence detection we have, for the first time, shown that the K(D)(4-2) for Ec-PK1 is in the subnanomolar range, well below the concentrations used in kinetic studies. In addition, we show that, unlike some other PK isoenzymes, the modulation of oligomeric state by the allosteric effectors FBP and PEP does not occur at a concentration of 10 nM or above.",M1
19799945,"A novel RPMXR motif among class II 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthases is required for enzymatic activity and glyphosate resistance.The shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase is an attractive target for drugs and herbicides. Here we identified a novel RPMXR motif that is strictly conserved among class II EPSP synthases. Site-directed mutational analysis of this motif showed that substitutions of the four strictly conserved amino acid residues, Arg127, Pro128, Met129, and Arg131, resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, whereas changes in the non-conserved Asn130 residue strongly influenced glyphosate resistance (all numbering according to Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 EPSP synthase). These experimental results, combined with 3D structure modeling of the location and interaction of the RPMXR motif with phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P), demonstrate that the novel motif is required for enzymatic activity and glyphosate resistance of class II EPSP synthases.",M1
19750810,"CO2-fixing enzymes and phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism in the fish parasite Hysterothylacium aduncum (Ascaridoidea, Anisakidae).CO2 stimulates the development of many of the intestinal helminths that are able to fix CO2 by means of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), such as Hysterothylacium aduncum. We determined the activity of CO2-fixing enzymes such as PEPCK and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), although no significant activity was detected for pyruvate carboxylase or carboxylating-malic enzyme. The former act on phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) to yield oxalacetate. In the helminths studied, PEP has a vital role in glucidic metabolism. Consequently, we determined the activity of other enzymes involved in the crossroad of PEP, such as pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. All enzymes detected showed significant variations in activity during the in vitro development of the parasite from the third larval stage to mature adult. Fixing of CO2 by PEPCK decreased during development (from 228 to 115 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), while that by PEPC increased (from 19 to 46 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein). This enzyme, which is rare in animals, could play a part in detecting levels of free phosphate, releasing it from PEP when required for processes such as glycogenolysis, glycolysis and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. PK, which showed increasing activity during development up to immature adult (from 56 to 82 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), could act in combination with PEPC to obtain energy in the cytosol (in the form of ATP) and in the mitochondria (possible destination of the pyruvate formed), compensating for the decrease in activity of PEPCK.",M1
19726178,"Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of sucrose by Clostridium tyrobutyricum ZJU 8235: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.The uptake and metabolism of sucrose, the major sugar in industrial cane molasses, by Clostridium tyrobutyricum ZJU 8235 was investigated and this study provided the first definitive evidence for phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) activity in butyric acid-producing bacteria. Glucose was utilized preferentially to sucrose when both substrates were present in the medium. The PEP-dependent sucrose: PTS was induced by growing C. tyrobutyricum on sucrose (but not glucose) as the sole carbon source. Extract fractionation and PTS reconstitution experiments revealed that both soluble and membrane components were required for bioactivity. Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase and fructokinase activities were also detected in sucrose-grown cultures. Based on these findings, a pathway of sucrose metabolism in this organism was proposed that includes the forming of sucrose-6-phosphate via the PTS and its further degradation into glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.",M1
19719323,"Functional energetic landscape in the allosteric regulation of muscle pyruvate kinase. 2. Fluorescence study.The energetic landscape of the allosteric regulatory mechanism of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Four novel insights were uncovered. (1) ADP exhibits a dual property. Depending on the temperature, ADP can regulate RMPK activity by switching the enzyme to either the R or T state. (2) The assumption that ligand binding to RMPK is state-dependent is only correct for <e>PEP</e> but not Phe and ADP. (3) The effect of pH on the regulatory behavior of RMPK is partly due to the complex pattern of proton release or absorption linked to the multiple linked equilibria which govern the activity of the enzyme. (4) The R &lt;--&gt; T equilibrium is accompanied by a significant DeltaC(p), rendering RMPK most sensitive to temperature under physiological conditions. To rigorously test the validity of conclusions derived from the ITC data, in this study a fluorescence approach, albeit indirect, that tracks continuous structural perturbations was employed. Intrinsic Trp fluorescence of RMPK in the absence and presence of substrates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP, and the allosteric inhibitor Phe, was measured in the temperature range between 4 and 45 degrees C. For data analysis, the fluorescence data were complemented by ITC experiments to yield an extended data set allowing more complete characterization of the RMPK regulatory mechanism. Twenty-one thermodynamic parameters were derived to define the network of linked interactions involved in regulating the allosteric behavior of RMPK through global analysis of the ITC and fluorescent data sets. In this study, 27 independent curves with more than 1600 experimental points were globally analyzed. Consequently, the consensus results substantiate not only the conclusions derived from the ITC data but also structural information characterizing the transition between the active and inactive states of RMPK and the antagonism between ADP and Phe binding. The latter observation reveals a novel role for ADP in the allosteric regulation of RMPK.",M1
19635791,"Phosphoenolpyruvate cycling via mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase links anaplerosis and mitochondrial GTP with insulin secretion.Pancreatic beta-cells couple the oxidation of glucose to the secretion of insulin. Apart from the canonical K(ATP)-dependent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), there are important K(ATP)-independent mechanisms involving both anaplerosis and mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP). How mtGTP that is trapped within the mitochondrial matrix regulates the cytosolic calcium increases that drive GSIS remains a mystery. Here we have investigated whether the mitochondrial isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) is the GTPase linking hydrolysis of mtGTP made by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-GTP) to an anaplerotic pathway producing phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>). Although cytosolic PEPCK (PEPCK-C) is absent, PEPCK-M message and protein were detected in INS-1 832/13 cells, rat islets, and mouse islets. PEPCK enzymatic activity is half that of primary hepatocytes and is localized exclusively to the mitochondria. Novel (13)C-labeling strategies in INS-1 832/13 cells and islets measured substantial contribution of PEPCK-M to the synthesis of PEP. As high as 30% of PEP in INS-1 832/13 cells and 41% of PEP in rat islets came from PEPCK-M. The contribution of PEPCK-M to overall PEP synthesis more than tripled with glucose stimulation. Silencing the PEPCK-M gene completely inhibited GSIS underscoring its central role in mitochondrial metabolism-mediated insulin secretion. Given that mtGTP synthesized by SCS-GTP is an indicator of TCA flux that is crucial for GSIS, PEPCK-M is a strong candidate to link mtGTP synthesis with insulin release through anaplerotic PEP cycling.",M1
19494579,"Bacterial <e>PEP</e>-dependent carbohydrate: phosphotransferase systems couple sensing and global control mechanisms.The PEP-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) of enteric bacteria constitute a complex sensory system which involves as its central element a PEP-dependent His-protein kinase (Enzyme I). As a unit, the PTS comprises up to 20 different transporters per cell which correspond to its chemoreceptors for PTS carbohydrates, and several targeting subunits, which include in the low [G+C] Gram-positive bacteria an ancillary Ser/Thr-protein kinase. The PTS senses the presence of carbohydrates, in particular glucose, in the medium and the energy state of the cell, in the form of either the intracellular PEP-to-pyruvate ratio or the D-fructose-bisphosphate levels. This information is subsequently communicated to cellular targets, in particular those involved in the chemotactic response of the cell towards PTS carbohydrates, and in sensing glucose in the medium, using cAMP and several targeting subunits as intermediates. Peptide targeting subunits ensure the fast, transient, and yet accurate communication of the PTS with its more than hundred different targets, avoiding at the same time unwanted cross-talk. Many elements of this sensory system are simultaneously elements of specific and global regulatory networks. Thus, the PTS controls, besides the immediate (in the ms to s range) chemotactic responses, the activity of the various carbohydrate transporters and enzymes involved in carbon and energy metabolism through inducer exclusion, and in a delayed response (in the min to h range) the synthesis of these transporters and catabolic enzymes through catabolite repression. Indirect consequences of this program are phenomena related to cell surface rearrangements, which include flagella synthesis, as well as memory, adaptation, and learning effects. The analogy between the PTS and other prokaryotic systems, and more complex sensory systems from eukaryotic organisms which share elements with regulatory systems is obvious.",M1
19231879,"Infrared spectrum of phosphoenol pyruvate: computational and experimental studies.The infrared spectrum of phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) in aqueous solution was studied experimentally and theoretically in its fully ionized, singly protonated and doubly protonated form. The density functional theory with the B3LYP functional and with the 6-31G(d,p), 6-31++G(d,p), and 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets were used in the theoretical study. The calculations with the two latter basis sets and the CPCM continuum model for water showed good agreement with the experiments except for vibrations assigned to hydroxyl groups. These needed to be modeled with explicit water molecules. The effects of deuteration and of (13)C(2,3) labeling of PEP were reproduced by the calculations.",M1
19205429,"[Transamination in the mechanism of protection of mitochondria from Ca2+ overload]A high sensitivity of the succinate-dependent uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria to (1) the transamination (TA) substrates glutamate (GLU) and alpha-ketoglutarate (KGL) and (2) the inhibitor of TA aminooxyacetate (AOA) was revealed. The effect of the TA substrates on Ca2+ uptake depends on the ratio (1:10 mM) of their concentrations: 1 mM GLU activates and 10 mM KGL decreases this activation by 35-46%, whereas AOA suppresses the Ca2+ capacity by 60% and the inhibitor of succinate oxidation malonate, by 80-90%. A similarity in the limiting action of KGL and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), two sources of oxaloacetate (OAA) and GTP, on Ca2+ capacity was revealed. The differences in the effects of KGL and GLU and the similarity in the effects of KGL and PEP on succinate oxidation are explained by the effect of OAA and GTP on this oxidation. The alternating inflow of OAA in coupled processes of TA, pyruvate cycle, and tricarboxylic acids cycle provides the reciprocal activation and cyclic recurrence of Ca2+ uptake, i. e., protection from the chronic exhausting activation of Ca2+-regulated dehydrogenases, the overload of Ca2+-outgoing channels, and the excessive production of free radicals in mitochondria. The reciprocal regulation of Ca2+ uptake by TA is considered as a mechanism of the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis and protection of mitochondria against Ca2+ overload.",M1
19021757,"Tyr235 of human cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase influences catalysis through an anion-quadrupole interaction with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylate.Tyr235 of GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) carboxykinase is a fully invariant residue. The aromatic ring of this residue establishes an energetically favorable weak anion-quadrupole interaction with PEP carboxylate. The role of Tyr235 in catalysis was investigated via kinetic analysis of site-directed mutagenesis-derived variants. The Y235F change lowered the apparent K(m) for PEP by about six-fold, raised the apparent K(m) for Mn(2+) by about 70-fold, and decreased oxaloacetate (OAA)-forming activity by about 10-fold. These effects were due to an enhanced anion-quadrupole interaction between the aromatic side chain at position 235, which now lacked a hydroxyl group, and PEP carboxylate, which probably increased the distance between PEP and Mn(2+) and consequently affected the phosphoryl transfer step and overall catalysis. For the Y235A and Y235S changes, an elimination of the favorable edge-on interaction increased the apparent K(m) for PEP by four- and six-fold, respectively, and the apparent K(m) for Mn(2+) by eight- and six-fold, respectively. The pyruvate kinase-like activity, representing the PEP dephosphorylation step of the OAA-forming reaction, was affected by the substitutions in a similar way to the complete reaction. These observations indicate that the aromatic ring of Tyr235 helps to position PEP in the active site and the hydroxyl group allows an optimal PEP-Mn(2+) distance for efficient phosphoryl transfer and overall catalysis. The Y235A and Y235S changes drastically reduced the PEP-forming and OAA decarboxylase activities, probably due to the elimination of the stabilizing interaction between Tyr235 and the respective products, PEP and pyruvate.",M1
18778100,"Lessons from nature: biomimetic organocatalytic carbon-carbon bond formations.Nature utilizes simple C2 and C3 building blocks, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), and the  active aldehyde  in various enzyme-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formations to efficiently build up complex organic molecules. In this Perspective, we describe the transition from using enantiopure chemical synthetic equivalents of these building blocks, employing our SAMP/RAMP hydrazone methodology and metalated chiral alpha-amino nitriles, to the asymmetric organocatalytic versions developed in our laboratory. Following this biomimetic strategy, the DHAP equivalent 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-5-one (dioxanone) has been used in the proline-catalyzed synthesis of carbohydrates, aminosugars, carbasugars, polyoxamic acid, and various sphingosines. Proline-catalyzed aldol reactions involving a PEP-like equivalent have also allowed for the asymmetric synthesis of ulosonic acid precursors. By mimicking the  active aldehyde  nucleophilic acylations in Nature catalyzed by the thiamine-dependent enzyme, transketolase, enantioselective N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed benzoin and Stetter reactions have been developed. Finally, based on Nature's use of domino reactions to convert simple building blocks into complex and highly functionalized molecules, we report on our development of biomimetic asymmetric multicomponent domino reactions which couple enamine and iminium catalysis.",M1
18751889,"Synaptic vesicle-bound pyruvate kinase can support vesicular glutamate uptake.Glucose metabolism is essential for normal brain function and plays a vital role in synaptic transmission. Recent evidence suggests that ATP synthesized locally by glycolysis, particularly via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase, is critical for synaptic transmission. We present evidence that ATP generated by synaptic vesicle-associated pyruvate kinase is harnessed to transport glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Isolated synaptic vesicles incorporated [(3)H]glutamate in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and ADP. Pyruvate kinase activators and inhibitors stimulated and reduced PEP/ADP-dependent glutamate uptake, respectively. Membrane potential was also formed in the presence of pyruvate kinase activators.  ATP-trapping  experiments using hexokinase and glucose suggest that ATP produced by vesicle-associated pyruvate kinase is more readily used than exogenously added ATP. Other neurotransmitters such as GABA, dopamine, and serotonin were also taken up into crude synaptic vesicles in a PEP/ADP-dependent manner. The possibility that ATP locally generated by glycolysis supports vesicular accumulation of neurotransmitters is discussed.",M1
18491034,"Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent inhibition of collagen biosynthesis, alpha2beta1 integrin and IGF-I receptor signaling in cultured fibroblasts.The mechanism of collagen biosynthesis regulation is not fully understood. The finding that prolidase plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis and phosphoenolpyruvate inhibits prolidase activity  in vitro  led to evaluate its effect on collagen biosynthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Confluent fibroblasts were treated with millimolar concentrations (1-4 mM) of phosphoenolpyruvate monopotassium salt (<e>PEP</e>) for 24 h. It was found that PEP-dependent decrease in prolidase activity and expression was accompanied by parallel decrease in collagen biosynthesis. However, the experiments with inhibitor of PEP production, 3-mercaptopicolinate revealed no direct correlation between collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity and expression. Since insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) is the most potent stimulator of both collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity, and prolidase is regulated by beta(1) integrin signaling, the effect of PEP on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and beta(1) integrin receptor expressions were evaluated. It was found that the exposure of the cells to 4 mM PEP contributed to a decrease in IGF-IR and beta(1) integrin receptor expressions. The data suggest that PEP-dependent decrease of collagen biosynthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts may undergo through depression of alpha(2)beta(1) integrin and IGF-IR signaling. The hypothetical mechanism of the role of prolidase in IGF-IR, beta(1) integrin receptor expressions, and clinical significance of the process are discussed.",M1
18331021,"Ab initio QM/MM studies of the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by <e>PEP</e> mutase suggest a dissociative metaphosphate transition state.The interconversion between phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and phosphonopyruvate (P-pyr) catalyzed by PEP mutase is investigated using an ab initio QM/MM method with the QM region treated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Two-dimensional minimum energy path calculations were carried out for both the wild-type enzyme and the N122A mutant. The calculations suggest a dissociative transition state featuring metaphosphate and Mg(2+)-coordinating pyruvate enolate, stabilized by an extensive hydrogen bond network involving Asn122, Ser123, Arg159, His190, Ser46, and Leu48. It is also found that a substantial conformational change in the pyruvyl group is required for the interconversion.",M1
18223071,"Cyclic AMP-dependent catabolite repression is the dominant control mechanism of metabolic fluxes under glucose limitation in Escherichia coli.Although a whole arsenal of mechanisms are potentially involved in metabolic regulation, it is largely uncertain when, under which conditions, and to which extent a particular mechanism actually controls network fluxes and thus cellular physiology. Based on (13)C flux analysis of Escherichia coli mutants, we elucidated the relevance of global transcriptional regulation by ArcA, ArcB, Cra, CreB, CreC, Crp, Cya, Fnr, Hns, Mlc, OmpR, and UspA on aerobic glucose catabolism in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a growth rate of 0.1 h(-1). The by far most relevant control mechanism was cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression as the inducer of the phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-glyoxylate cycle and thus low tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes. While all other mutants and the reference E. coli strain exhibited high glyoxylate shunt and PEP carboxykinase fluxes, and thus high PEP-glyoxylate cycle flux, this cycle was essentially abolished in both the Crp and Cya mutants, which lack the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein complex. Most other mutations were phenotypically silent, and only the Cra and Hns mutants exhibited slightly altered flux distributions through PEP carboxykinase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. The Cra effect on PEP carboxykinase was probably the consequence of a specific control mechanism, while the Hns effect appears to be unspecific. For central metabolism, the available data thus suggest that a single transcriptional regulation process exerts the dominant control under a given condition and this control is highly specific for a single pathway or cycle within the network.",M1
18051609,"Engineering and characterization of the isolated C-terminal domain of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase.5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase catalyzes the formation of EPSP and inorganic phosphate from shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. To delineate the domain-specific function, we successfully isolated the discontinuous C-terminal domain (residues 1-21, linkers, 240-427) of EPSP synthase (427 residues) by site-directed mutagenesis. The engineered C-terminal domains containing no linker (CTD), or with gly-gly (CTD(GG)) and gly-ser-ser-gly (CTD(GSSG)) linkers were purified and characterized as having distinct native-like secondary and tertiary structures. However, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), 15N-HSQC, and 31P-NMR revealed that neither its substrate nor inhibitor binds the isolated domain. The isolated domain maintained structural integrity, but did not function as the half of the full-length protein.",M1
17475535,"How does an enzyme recognize CO2?Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) reversibly catalyzes the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. Carbon dioxide, and not bicarbonate ion, is the substrate utilized. Assays of the carboxylation reaction show that initial velocities are 7.6-fold higher when CO(2) is used instead of HCO(3)(-). Two Escherichia coli PCK-CO(2) crystal structures are presented here. The location of CO(2) is the same for both structures; however the orientation of CO(2) is significantly different, likely from the presence of a manganese ion in one of the structures. PCK and the other three known protein-CO(2) crystal structure complexes have been compared; all have CO(2) hydrogen bonding with a basic amino acid side chain (Arg65 or Lys213 in PCK), likely to polarize CO(2) to make the central carbon atom more electrophilic and thus more reactive. Kinetic studies found that the PCK mutant Arg65Gln increased the K(M) for substrates <e>PEP</e> and oxaloacetate but not for CO(2). The unchanged K(M) for CO(2) can be explained since the Arg65Gln mutant likely maintains a hydrogen bond to one of the oxygen atoms of carbon dioxide.",M1
17400748,"Insights into the autotrophic CO2 fixation pathway of the archaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis: comprehensive analysis of the central carbon metabolism.Ignicoccus hospitalis is an autotrophic hyperthermophilic archaeon that serves as a host for another parasitic/symbiotic archaeon, Nanoarchaeum equitans. In this study, the biosynthetic pathways of I. hospitalis were investigated by in vitro enzymatic analyses, in vivo (13)C-labeling experiments, and genomic analyses. Our results suggest the operation of a so far unknown pathway of autotrophic CO(2) fixation that starts from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). The cyclic regeneration of acetyl-CoA, the primary CO(2) acceptor molecule, has not been clarified yet. In essence, acetyl-CoA is converted into pyruvate via reductive carboxylation by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Pyruvate-water dikinase converts pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), which is carboxylated to oxaloacetate by PEP carboxylase. An incomplete citric acid cycle is operating: citrate is synthesized from oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by a (re)-specific citrate synthase, whereas a 2-oxoglutarate-oxidizing enzyme is lacking. Further investigations revealed that several special biosynthetic pathways that have recently been described for various archaea are operating. Isoleucine is synthesized via the uncommon citramalate pathway and lysine via the alpha-aminoadipate pathway. Gluconeogenesis is achieved via a reverse Embden-Meyerhof pathway using a novel type of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Pentosephosphates are formed from hexosephosphates via the suggested ribulose-monophosphate pathway, whereby formaldehyde is released from C-1 of hexose. The organism may not contain any sugar-metabolizing pathway. This comprehensive analysis of the central carbon metabolism of I. hospitalis revealed further evidence for the unexpected and unexplored diversity of metabolic pathways within the (hyperthermophilic) archaea.",M1
17381075,"Structural and mechanistic changes along an engineered path from metallo to nonmetallo 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthases.There are two classes of KDO8P synthases characterized respectively by the presence or absence of a metal in the active site. The nonmetallo KDO8PS from Escherichia coli and the metallo KDO8PS from Aquifex aeolicus are the best characterized members of each class. All amino acid residues that make important contacts with the substrates are conserved in both enzymes with the exception of Pro-10, Cys-11, Ser-235, and Gln-237 of the A. aeolicus enzyme, which correspond respectively to Met-25, Asn-26, Pro-252, and Ala-254 in the E. coli enzyme. Interconversion between the two forms of KDO8P synthases can be achieved by substituting the metal-coordinating cysteine of metallo synthases with the corresponding asparagine of nonmetallo synthases, and vice versa. In this report we describe the structural changes elicited by the C11N mutation and by three combinations of mutations (P10M/C11N, C11N/S235P/Q237A, and P10M/C11N/S235P/Q237A) situated along possible evolutionary paths connecting the A. aeolicus and the E. coli enzyme. All four mutants are not capable of binding metal and lack the structural asymmetry among subunits with regard to substrate binding and conformation of the L7 loop, which is typical of A. aeolicus wild-type KDO8PS but is absent in the E. coli enzyme. Despite the lack of the active site metal, the mutant enzymes display levels of activity ranging from 46% to 24% of the wild type. With the sole exception of the quadruple mutant, metal loss does not affect the thermal stability of KDO8PS. The free energy of unfolding in water is also either unchanged or even increased in the mutant enzymes, suggesting that the primary role of the active site metal in A. aeolicus KDO8PS is not to increase the enzyme stability. In all four mutants A5P binding displaces a water molecule located on the si side of <e>PEP</e>. In particular, in the double and triple mutant, A5P binds with the aldehyde carbonyl in hydrogen bond distance of Asn-11, while in the wild type this functional group points away from Cys-11. This alternative conformation of A5P is likely to have functional significance as it resembles the conformation of the acyclic reaction intermediate, which is observed here for the first time in some of the active sites of the triple mutant. The direct visualization of this intermediate by X-ray crystallography confirms earlier mechanistic models of KDO8P synthesis. In particular, the configuration of the C2 chiral center of the intermediate supports a model of the reaction in nonmetallo KDO8PS, in which water attacks an oxocarbenium ion or PEP from the si side of C2. Several explanations are offered to reconcile this observation with the fact that no water molecule is observed at this position in the mutant enzymes in the presence of both PEP and A5P. Significant differences were observed between the wild-type and the mutant enzymes in the Km values for PEP and A5P and in the Kd values for inorganic phosphate and R5P. These differences may reflect an evolutionary adaptation of metallo and nonmetallo KDO8PS's to the cellular concentrations of these metabolites in their respective hosts.",M1
17307338,"Inhibitory effect of phosphoenolpyruvate on glycolytic enzymes in Escherichia coli.For analyzing the control of energy metabolism in Escherichia coli, we carried out kinetic analyses of glycolytic enzymes purified from the overexpressing clones of E. coli K12 W3110 that were constructed with the vector pCA24N. Phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) acted as an effective inhibitor of enzymes of the preparatory phase in glycolysis. Glucokinase was potently inhibited by PEP in a competitive manner with respect to ATP: the K(i) value for PEP was 0.1mM. PEP further inhibited phosphoglucoisomerase to a lesser extent, and phosphofructokinase A and aldolase A with 10-fold the K(i) values of glucokinase and phosphoglucoisomerase. Glucose is incorporated into E. coli through two pathways: the PTS (PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system) and the glucokinase reaction. PEP, a potent inhibitor of E. coli glucokinase, unlike most eukaryotic hexokinases, can act as a signal molecule controlling glucose uptake and glycolytic flux in cells.",M1
17053069,"Structure of phosphorylated enzyme I, the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system sugar translocation signal protein.Bacterial transport of many sugars, coupled to their phosphorylation, is carried out by the phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>):sugar phosphotransferase system and involves five phosphoryl group transfer reactions. Sugar translocation initiates with the Mg(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of enzyme I (EI) by PEP. Crystals of Escherichia coli EI were obtained by mixing the protein with Mg(2+) and PEP, followed by oxalate, an EI inhibitor. The crystal structure reveals a dimeric protein where each subunit comprises three domains: a domain that binds the partner PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system protein, HPr; a domain that carries the phosphorylated histidine residue, His-189; and a PEP-binding domain. The PEP-binding site is occupied by Mg(2+) and oxalate, and the phosphorylated His-189 is in-line for phosphotransfer to/from the ligand. Thus, the structure represents an enzyme intermediate just after phosphotransfer from PEP and before a conformational transition that brings His-189 approximately P in proximity to the phosphoryl group acceptor, His-15 of HPr. A model of this conformational transition is proposed whereby swiveling around an alpha-helical linker disengages the His domain from the PEP-binding domain. Assuming that HPr binds to the HPr-binding domain as observed by NMR spectroscopy of an EI fragment, a rotation around two linker segments orients the His domain relative to the HPr-binding domain so that His-189 approximately P and His-15 are appropriately stationed for an in-line phosphotransfer reaction.",M1
17022686,"Regulating expression of pyruvate kinase in Bacillus subtilis for control of growth rate and formation of acidic byproducts.Our prior work has shown that a pyk mutant of Bacillus subtilis exhibited diminished acidic byproduct accumulation, dramatically elevated phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) pool, and reduced growth rate. To determine if a low acetate-producing but fast-growing strain of B. subtilis could be developed, we placed the expression of the pyk gene under the control of an inducible promoter. Enzyme measurements proved that PYK activity of the inducible PYK mutant (iPYK) increases with the isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration. Batch growth experiments showed that growth rate and acid formation are closely related to the induction level of pyk. Measurements of cell growth rate and acetate formation of the iPYK mutant at different induction levels revealed that a PYK activity of about 12% of wild-type allows for good growth rate (0.4 h(-)(1) versus 0.63 h(-)(1) of wild-type) and low acetate production (0.26 g/L versus 1.05 g/L of wild-type). This is the first report to our knowledge of a metabolically engineered B. subtilis strain that allows good growth rate and low acid production in batch cultures. Finally, it was found that, by varying the pyk induction level, intracellular PEP concentration can be controlled over a wide range. The intracellular PEP concentration is intimately connected to the regulation of the transport of phosphotransferase system (PTS) sugars in the presence of glucose. Because there is no other method for modulating intracellular PEP levels, this finding represents a major advance in one's ability to dissect the function of the PTS and sugar metabolism in bacteria.",M1
16981709,"Structure and kinetics of phosphonopyruvate hydrolase from Variovorax sp. Pal2: new insight into the divergence of catalysis within the <e>PEP</e> mutase/isocitrate lyase superfamily.Phosphonopyruvate (P-pyr) hydrolase (PPH), a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) mutase/isocitrate lyase (PEPM/ICL) superfamily, hydrolyzes P-pyr and shares the highest sequence identity and functional similarity with PEPM. Recombinant PPH from Variovorax sp. Pal2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Analytical gel filtration indicated that the protein exists in solution predominantly as a tetramer. The PPH pH rate profile indicates maximal activity over a broad pH range. The steady-state kinetic constants determined for a rapid equilibrium ordered kinetic mechanism with Mg2+ binding first (Kd = 140 +/- 40 microM), are kcat = 105 +/- 2 s(-1) and P-pyr Km = 5 +/- 1 microM. PEP (slow substrate kcat = 2 x 10(-4) s(-1)), oxalate, and sulfopyruvate are competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 2.0 +/- 0.1 mM, 17 +/- 1 microM, and 210 +/- 10 microM, respectively. Three PPH crystal structures have been determined, that of a ligand-free enzyme, the enzyme bound to Mg2+ and oxalate (inhibitor), and the enzyme bound to Mg2+ and P-pyr (substrate). The complex with the inhibitor was obtained by cocrystallization, whereas that with the substrate was obtained by briefly soaking crystals of the ligand-free enzyme with P-pyr prior to flash cooling. The PPH structure resembles that of the other members of the PEPM/ICL superfamily and is most similar to the functionally related enzyme, PEPM. Each monomer of the dimer of dimers exhibits an (alpha/beta)8 barrel fold with the eighth helix swapped between two molecules of the dimer. Both P-pyr and oxalate are anchored to the active site by Mg2+. The loop capping the active site is disordered in all three structures, in contrast to PEPM, where the equivalent loop adopts an open or disordered conformation in the unbound state but sequesters the inhibitor from solvent in the bound state. Crystal packing may have favored the open conformation of PPH even when the enzyme was cocrystallized with the oxalate inhibitor. Structure alignment of PPH with other superfamily members revealed two pairs of invariant or conservatively replaced residues that anchor the flexible gating loop. The proposed PPH catalytic mechanism is analogous to that of PEPM but includes activation of a water nucleophile with the loop Thr118 residue.",M1
16867985,"Structure of the full-length enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system.Enzyme I (EI) is the phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-protein phosphotransferase at the entry point of the PEP-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system, which catalyzes carbohydrate uptake into bacterial cells. In the first step of this pathway EI phosphorylates the heat-stable phospho carrier protein at His-15 using PEP as a phosphoryl donor in a reaction that requires EI dimerization and autophosphorylation at His-190. The structure of the full-length protein from Staphylococcus carnosus at 2.5A reveals an extensive interaction surface between two molecules in adjacent asymmetric units. Structural comparison with related domains indicates that this surface represents the biochemically relevant contact area of dimeric EI. Each monomer has an extended configuration with the phosphohistidine and heat-stable phospho carrier protein-binding domains clearly separated from the C-terminal dimerization and PEP-binding region. The large distance of more than 35A between the active site His-190 and the PEP binding site suggests that large conformational changes must occur during the process of autophosphorylation, as has been proposed for the structurally related enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase. Our structure for the first time offers a framework to analyze a large amount of research in the context of the full-length model.",M1
16852731,"Theoretical studies of dissociative phosphoryl transfer in interconversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate: solvent effects, thio effects, and implications for enzymatic reactions.The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) to phosphonopyruvate (P-pyr) is catalyzed by PEP mutase via a dissociative mechanism. In this work, we investigate the uncatalyzed reaction using ab initio methods, density functional theory, and the semiempirical MNDO/d method. Comparisons of geometries and relative energies of stationary points (minima and transition states) with density functional results indicate that the semiempirical method is reasonably accurate. Solvent effects are examined using implicit solvent models, including the recently extended smooth conductor-like screening model. Due to the large negative charge carried by the system, solvation is found to drastically alter the location and energy of stationary points along the dissociative reaction pathways. The influence of substituting a nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen by sulfur (thio effects) was also investigated. Implications of these results for the enzymatic reaction are discussed.",M1
16843704,"Experimental and theoretical study of the hydration of phosphate groups in esters of biological interest.We have studied the influence of different groups esterified to phosphates on the strength of the interaction of the PO bond with one water molecule. Experimental vibrational spectra of PO(4)3-, HPO4(2-), H2PO4-, phosphoenolpiruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and ortho-phosphocholamine (o-PC) were obtained by means of FTIR spectroscopy. Geometry calculations were performed using standard gradient techniques and the default convergence criteria as implemented in GAUSSIAN 98 Program. In order to assess the behaviour of such DFT theoretical calculations using B3LYP with 6-31G* and 6-311++G** basis sets, we carried out a comparative work for those compounds. The results were then used to predict the principal bands of the vibrational spectra and molecular parameters (geometrical parameters, stabilisation energies, electronic density). In this work, the relative stability and the nature of the PO bond in those compounds were systematically and quantitatively investigated by means of Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. The topological properties of electronic charge density are analysed employing Bader's Atoms in Molecules theory (AIM). The hydrogen bonding of phosphate groups with water is highly stable and the PO bond wavenumbers are shifted to lower experimental and calculated values (with the DFT/6-311++G** basis set). Accordingly, the predicted order of the relative stability of the hydrogen bonding of the water molecule to the PO bond of the investigated compounds is: PO(4)3-&gt;HPO4(2-)&gt;H2PO4-&gt;phosphoenolpiruvate&gt;phosphocholamine for the two basis sets used.",M1

In a reaction mixture utilizing 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) as an energy source, the supply of ATP was significantly enhanced when the reaction mixture was supplied with sodium oxalate, a potent inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PPS). The productivity of protein synthesis was also increased by approximately 70% upon the addition of oxalate. It was presumed that this enhancement in ATP supply resulted from the prevention of the pyruvate --&gt; <e>PEP</e> reaction, which causes nonproductive ATP consumption. For the initial presence of 2.1 mM sodium oxalate, approximately 720 microg/ml chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was produced after 3 h of incubation at 37 degrees C.",M1
16547355,"The monomer/dimer transition of enzyme I of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system.Enzyme I (EI) is the first protein in the phosphotransfer sequence of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. This system catalyzes sugar phosphorylation/transport and is stringently regulated. Since EI homodimer accepts the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), whereas the monomer does not, EI may be a major factor in controlling sugar uptake. Previous work from this and other laboratories (e.g. Dimitrova, M. N., Szczepanowski, R. H., Ruvinov, S. B., Peterkofsky, A., and Ginsburg A. (2002) Biochem. 41, 906-913), indicate that K(a) is sensitive to several parameters. We report here a systematic study of K(a) determined by sedimentation equilibrium, which showed that it varied by 1000-fold, responding to virtually every parameter tested, including temperature, phosphorylation, pH (6.5 versus 7.5), ionic strength, and especially the ligands Mg(2+) and PEP. This variability may be required for a regulatory protein. Further insight was gained by analyzing EI by sedimentation velocity, by near UV CD spectroscopy, and with a nonphosphorylatable active site mutant, EI-H189Q, which behaved virtually identically to EI. The singular properties of EI are explained by a model consistent with the results reported here and in the accompanying paper (Patel, H. V., Vyas, K. A., Mattoo, R. L., Southworth, M., Perler, F. B., Comb, D., and Roseman, S. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 17579-17587). We suggest that EI and EI-H189Q each comprise a multiplicity of conformers and progressively fewer conformers as they dimerize and bind Mg(2+) and finally PEP. Mg(2+) alone induces small or no detectable changes in structure, but large conformational changes ensue with Mg(2+)/PEP. This effect is explained by a  swiveling mechanism  (similar to that suggested for pyruvate phosphate dikinase (Herzberg, O., Chen, C. C., Kapadia, G., McGuire, M., Carroll, L. J., Noh, S. J., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 2652-2657)), which brings the C-terminal domain with the two bound ligands close to the active site His(189).",M1
16547354,"Properties of the C-terminal domain of enzyme I of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system.The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>):glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) mediates uptake/phosphorylation of sugars. The transport of all PTS sugars requires Enzyme I (EI) and a phosphocarrier histidine protein of the PTS (HPr). The PTS is stringently regulated, and a potential mechanism is the monomer/dimer transition of EI, because only the dimer accepts the phosphoryl group from PEP. EI monomer consists of two major domains, at the N and C termini (EI-N and EI-C, respectively). EI-N accepts the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr but not PEP. However, it is phosphorylated by PEP(Mg(2+)) when complemented with EI-C. Here we report that the phosphotransfer rate increases approximately 25-fold when HPr is added to a mixture of EI-N, EI-C, and PEP(Mg(2+)). A model to explain this effect is offered. Sedimentation equilibrium results show that the association constant for dimerization of EI-C monomers is 260-fold greater than the K(a) for native EI. The ligands have no detectable effect on the secondary structure of the dimer (far UV CD) but have profound effects on the tertiary structure as determined by near UV CD spectroscopy, thermal denaturation, sedimentation equilibrium and velocity, and intrinsic fluorescence of the 2 Trp residues. The binding of PEP requires Mg(2+). For example, there is no effect of PEP on the T(m), an increase of 7 degrees C in the presence of Mg(2+), and approximately 14 degrees C when both are present. Interestingly, the dissociation constants for each of the ligands from EI-C are approximately the same as the kinetic (K(m)) constants for the ligands in the complete PTS sugar phosphorylation assays.",M1
16461663,"Nonlinear dependency of intracellular fluxes on growth rate in miniaturized continuous cultures of Escherichia coli.A novel mini-scale chemostat system was developed for the physiological characterization of 10-ml cultures. The parallel operation of eight such mini-scale chemostats was exploited for systematic 13C analysis of intracellular fluxes over a broad range of growth rates in glucose-limited Escherichia coli. As expected, physiological variables changed monotonously with the dilution rate, allowing for the assessment of maintenance metabolism. Despite the linear dependence of total cellular carbon influx on dilution rate, the distribution of almost all major fluxes varied nonlinearly with dilution rate. Most prominent were the distinct maximum of glyoxylate shunt activity and the concomitant minimum of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at low to intermediate dilution rates of 0.05 to 0.2 h(-1). During growth on glucose, this glyoxylate shunt activity is best understood from a network perspective as the recently described phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-glyoxylate cycle that oxidizes PEP (or pyruvate) to CO2. At higher or extremely low dilution rates, in vivo PEP-glyoxylate cycle activity was low or absent. The step increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity at around 0.2 h(-1) was not related to the cellular demand for the reduction equivalent NADPH, since NADPH formation was 20 to 50% in excess of the anabolic demand at all dilution rates. The results demonstrate that mini-scale continuous cultivation enables quantitative and parallel characterization of intra- and extracellular phenotypes in steady state, thereby greatly reducing workload and costs for stable-isotope experiments.",M1
16296360,"[Augmentation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in isolated rabbit lungs with phosphoenolpyruvate]BACKGROUND: Phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) is a glycolytic substrate which can be metabolized to pyruvate with concomitant formation of ATP. We examined the effects of PEP on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). METHODS: Isolated rabbit lungs (n = 6) were reperfused at a flow rate of 40 ml x kg(-1) body weight x min(-1) with a mixture of the physiological salt solution and autologous blood. They were ventilated with a mixture of 21% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2. The HPV response was induced by reduction of inspired O2 concentration from 21 to 3% for 5 min and was evaluated by an increase of the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) with inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) at concentration of 0, 10, 20 ppm in random order. Next, PEP with the final concentration of 10 mM was added to the reservoir. After 30-min equilibration, the above protocol of hypoxic stimulations was repeated. RESULTS: PEP did not alter the basal PAP, but augmented the HPV response. Without and with PEP, inhaled NO depressed the HPV response in a dose-related manner and the half inhibition values (ED50) were 9.4 +/- 2.2, 14.9 +/- 10.3 ppm (mean +/- SD), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of intravenous PEP and inhaled NO may improve PaO2 without increasing PAP in acute respiratory failure.",M1
16288916,"The structure of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals a common catalytic scaffold and ancestry for type I and type II enzymes.The shikimate pathway, responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, is essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential target for the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). The DAH7PSs have been classified into two apparently unrelated types and, whereas structural data have been obtained for the type I DAH7PSs, no structural information is available for their type II counterparts. The type II DAH7PS from M.tuberculosis has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, functionally characterized and crystallized. It is found to be metal ion-dependent and subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and chorismate, with a significant synergistic effect when tryptophan is used in combination with phenylalanine. The crystal structure of M.tuberculosis DAH7PS has been determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined at 2.3A in complex with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and Mn(2+). The structure reveals a tightly associated dimer of (beta/alpha)(8) TIM barrels. The monomer fold, the arrangement of key residues in the active site, and the binding modes of <e>PEP</e> and Mn(2+), all match those of the type I enzymes, and indicate a common ancestry for the type I and type II DAH7PSs, despite their minimal sequence identity. In contrast, the structural elements that decorate the core (beta/alpha)(8) fold differ from those in the type I enzymes, consistent with their different regulatory and oligomeric properties.",M1
16288601,"Effects of insulin and cytosolic redox state on glucose production pathways in the isolated perfused mouse liver measured by integrated 2H and 13C NMR.A great deal is known about hepatic glucose production and its response to a variety of factors such as redox state, substrate supply and hormonal control, but the effects of these parameters on the flux through biochemical pathways which integrate to control glucose production are less clear. A combination of 13C and [2H]water tracers and NMR isotopomer analysis were used to investigate metabolic fluxes in response to altered cytosolic redox state and insulin. In livers isolated from fed mice and perfused with a mixture of substrates including lactate/pyruvate (10:1, w/w), hepatic glucose production had substantial contributions from glycogen, <e>PEP</e> (phosphoenolpyruvate) and glycerol. Inversion of the lactate/pyruvate ratio (1:10, w/w) resulted in a surprising decrease in the contribution from glycogen and an increase in that from PEP to glucose production. A change in the lactate/pyruvate ratio from 10:1 to 1:10 also stimulated flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (2-fold), while leaving oxygen consumption and overall glucose output unchanged. When lactate and pyruvate were eliminated from the perfusion medium, both gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic-acid-cycle flux were dramatically lower. Insulin lowered glucose production by inhibiting glycogenolysis at both low and high doses, but only at high levels of insulin did gluconeogenesis or tricarboxylic-acid-cycle flux tend towards lower values (P&lt;0.1). Our data demonstrate that, in the isolated mouse liver, substrate availability and cellular redox state have a dramatic impact on liver metabolism in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenesis. The tight correlation of these two pathways under multiple conditions suggest that interventions which increase or decrease hepatic tricarboxylic-acid-cycle flux will have a concomitant effect on gluconeogenesis and vice versa.",M1

(1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 683-687]. A reexamination of the kinetics of this enzyme shows LbPFK to have limited binding affinity toward the allosteric ligands, MgADP and <e>PEP</e>, with dissociation constants of approximately 20 mM for both. Their allosteric effects are observed only at high concentrations of these ligands, with both exhibiting inhibitory effects on substrate binding. No pH dependence was observed for the binding and the influence of MgADP and PEP on the enzyme. To attempt to explain these results, the crystal structure of LbPFK was solved using molecular replacement to 1.86 A resolution. A comparative study of the LbPFK structure with that of phosphofructokinases from E. coli (EcPFK) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsPFK) reveals a structure with conserved fold and substrate binding site. The effector binding site, however, shows many differences that could explain the observed decreases in binding affinity for MgADP and PEP in LbPFK as compared to the other two enzymes.",M1
16250233,"[Effect of silver nitrate, adenosine-5'-monophosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate on activity of extracellular fructose bisphosphatase of Acholeplasma laidlawii var. granulum strain 118]The reactions of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis proceed in good coordination in the cells of microorganisms, and each stage of these processes is distinctly regulated. Under such conditions fructose-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity (the enzyme level being constant in the cells of microorganisms) is inhibited by adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) and is activated by phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) depending on the kind of the source of carbon (glycolytic or glyconeogenic) used for microorganism growth. It is evident that the corresponding regulation of FBPase should be absent in the extracellular environment where one cannot observe a distinct coordination of functioning of the enzyme systems. The investigation results prove that both AMP and PEP, under their individual testing in concentrations up to 20 microM did not practically affect activity of extracellular FBPase, and at higher concentrations they sharply decreased its activity (200 microM AMP by 70%, and PEP - by 75%). Under joint use of PEP and AMP (in concentration 200 microM and 500 microM) one could observe mutual neutralization of the effect of these substances on FBPase; as a result, its activity decreased only by 15% under AMP concentration of 500 microM, and by 25% at AMP concentration of 200 microM, that is in complete agreement with the data of individual testing of the above substances. PEP in high concentrations has displayed itself as a more active repressor of FBPase activity than AMP. AgNO3 in concentrations to 20 microM has manifested itself as a moderate stimulator of FBPase activity and even in the concentration of 200 microM it decreased the enzyme activity by 50% only. The data obtained are rather different than those described in literature for cellular FBPases of microorganisms. It is known that AMP is a powerful inhibitor of its FBPases activity (Ki = 5 microM) while PEP activates it (Ka = 20 microM).",M1
16185659,"Effect of energy source on the efficiency of translational termination during cell-free protein synthesis.We studied how the fidelity of translation termination is affected by the method of ATP regeneration during cell-free protein synthesis. During the in vivo expression of hEPO, whose termination is directed by the UGA codon, we found that substantial proportions of the translational products showed a larger molecular weight than expected. Similar results were obtained in a cell-free synthesis reaction using phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) or 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) for ATP regeneration. However, when the energy source was switched to creatine phosphate (CP), the readthrough of the UGA codon was completely repressed and only the target protein of the correct size was expressed in a high yield. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the relationship between the regeneration of nucleotide triphosphates and protein readthrough, and we also believe that the discovery would pave the way to the selective and efficient expression of target proteins in cell-free protein synthesis systems.",M1
16171394,"Transient state kinetics of Enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli: equilibrium and second-order rate constants for the phosphotransfer reactions with phosphoenolpyruvate and HPr.The first two reactions in the phosphotransfer sequence of bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase systems are the autophosphorylation of Enzyme I by phosphoenolpyruvate followed by the transfer of the phospho group to the low-molecular weight protein, HPr. Transient state kinetic methods were used to estimate the second-order rate constants for both phosphotransfer reactions. These measurements support previous conclusions that only the dimer of Enzyme I, EI2, is autophosphorylated, and that the rate of formation of dimer is slow compared to the rate of its phosphorylation. The rate constants of the two autophosphorylation reactions of EI2 by <e>PEP</e> are 6.6 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), and differ from one another by a factor of less than 3. The rate constant for the transfer reaction between phospho-EI2 and HPr is unusually large for a covalent reaction between two proteins (220 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)), while the constant for the reverse reaction is 4.2 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). Using the previously reported equilibrium constant for the autophosphorylation reaction, 1.5, the overall equilibrium constant for phosphotransfer from PEP to HPr is 80, somewhat higher than that previously reported. The results also show that EI2 can phosphorylate multiple molecules of HPr without dissociating to a monomer (EI), and that EI can accept a phospho group from phospho-HPr. These results are directly applicable to predicting the rates of phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system sugar uptake in whole cells.",M1
16120604,"Identification and characterization of NeuB3 from Campylobacter jejuni as a pseudaminic acid synthase.Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causes of bacterial diarrhea worldwide, and Helicobacter pylori is known to cause duodenal ulcers. In all of these pathogenic organisms, the flagellin proteins are heavily glycosylated with a 2-keto-3-deoxy acid, pseudaminic acid (5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-L-manno-nonulosonic acid). The presence of pseudaminic acid is required for the proper development of the flagella and is thereby necessary for motility in, and invasion of, the host. In this study we report the first characterization of NeuB3 from C. jejuni as a pseudaminic acid synthase; the enzyme directly responsible for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid. Pseudaminic acid synthase catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) with the hexose, 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-L-altrose (6-deoxy-AltdiNAc), to form pseudaminic acid and phosphate. The enzymatic activity was monitored using 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, and the product was isolated and characterized. Kinetic analysis reveals that pseudaminic acid synthase requires the presence of a divalent metal ion for catalysis and that optimal catalysis occurs at pH 7.0. A coupled enzymatic assay gave the values for k(cat) of 0.65 +/- 0.01 s(-1), K(m)PEP of 6.5 +/- 0.4 microM, and K(m)6-deoxy-AltdiNAc of 9.5 +/- 0.7 microM. A mechanistic study on pseudaminic acid synthase, using [2-18O]PEP, shows that catalysis proceeds through a C-O bond cleavage mechanism similar to other PEP condensing synthases such as sialic acid synthase.",M1

16102602,"The <e>PEP</e>-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node as the switch point for carbon flux distribution in bacteria.In many organisms, metabolite interconversion at the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node involves a structurally entangled set of reactions that interconnects the major pathways of carbon metabolism and thus, is responsible for the distribution of the carbon flux among catabolism, anabolism and energy supply of the cell. While sugar catabolism proceeds mainly via oxidative or non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, anaplerosis and the initial steps of gluconeogenesis are accomplished by C3- (PEP- and/or pyruvate-) carboxylation and C4- (oxaloacetate- and/or malate-) decarboxylation, respectively. In contrast to the relatively uniform central metabolic pathways in bacteria, the set of enzymes at the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node represents a surprising diversity of reactions. Variable combinations are used in different bacteria and the question of the significance of all these reactions for growth and for biotechnological fermentation processes arises. This review summarizes what is known about the enzymes and the metabolic fluxes at the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node in bacteria, with a particular focus on the C3-carboxylation and C4-decarboxylation reactions in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. We discuss the activities of the enzymes, their regulation and their specific contribution to growth under a given condition or to biotechnological metabolite production. The present knowledge unequivocally reveals the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate nodes of bacteria to be a fascinating target of metabolic engineering in order to achieve optimized metabolite production.",M1

The phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) pool was increased by 2.3-fold, while the pyruvate and acetate pools were decreased by 78% and 57%, respectively. Pyruvate kinase might thus be a regulatory site for inosine synthesis.",M1
15979047,"Probing the role of tightly bound phosphoenolpyruvate in Escherichia coli 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase catalysis using quantitative time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the millisecond time range.Escherichia coli 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and D-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to produce KDO8P and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme is often isolated with varying amounts of tightly bound PEP substrate. To better understand the role of tightly bound PEP in E. coli KDO8P synthase catalysis, a combination of transient kinetic methodologies including rapid chemical quench and mass spectrometry techniques such as time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS) were used to study the enzyme purified both in the PEP-bound state and in the unbound state. Pre-steady state burst and single-turnover experiments using radiolabeled [1-(14)C] and [(32)P]A5P revealed significant kinetic differences between these enzyme preparations. The active sites concentrations for the bound and unbound states of the enzyme were almost the same (approximately 100%) and the product release for both states of the enzyme was rate limiting. However, the rate constant of product formation for the PEP-bound enzyme (125 s(-1)) was higher than that of the unbound enzyme (46 s(-1)). This was further confirmed by single-turnover experiments using radiolabeled [(32)P]A5P. Interestingly, when PEP was removed from the PEP-bound enzyme and external PEP was added before the kinetic experiments, both the pre-steady state burst and the single-turnover kinetic parameters were similar to those of the enzyme purified in the unbound state. The rate constants of product formation were determined as 44 s(-1) (burst experiment) and 48 s(-1) (single-turnover experiment). The reaction kinetics of the E. coli KDO8P synthase was also followed by time-resolved ESI mass spectrometry. To validate the suitability of this technique for conducting enzyme kinetics, the standard reaction of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by chymotrypsin was analyzed by stopped-flow and time-resolved ESI-TOF MS. The rate constant of p-nitrophenol formation followed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry matched perfectly the rate constant of acetyl-chymotrypsin intermediate formation followed by time-resolved ESI-TOF MS (0.1 s(-1)). The catalytic properties of the PEP-bound and unbound states of the E. coli KDO8P synthase were then studied on a millisecond time scale. The changes in the intensity of E*PEP, E*KDO8P, and E*intermediate complexes as a function of time were quantified and the reaction kinetics were modeled using KinTekSim simulation software. An analysis of the reaction kinetics established the kinetic competence of the intermediate based upon the rate constants for substrate decay and product formation. The ability of time-resolved ESI-TOF MS to detect and monitor the kinetics for the reaction intermediate constitutes a significant advantage over the traditional rapid chemical quench technique. For all three states of the enzyme (PEP-bound, unbound, and PEP removed from the PEP-bound state) the rate constants obtained by time-resolved ESI-TOF MS matched the pre-steady state rates determined by rapid chemical quench. A comparison of reaction time courses for each state of the enzyme revealed that, in the case of PEP-bound enzyme, the enzymatic reaction reached completion faster than that for the unbound state. In summary, these studies led to the conclusion that bound PEP has an important role in catalysis, maintaining the enzyme in a conformational state optimal for catalytic activity, and established the kinetic competence of the reaction intermediate. This technique has broad applicability for the kinetic analysis of any enzyme system where the substrates, products, or intermediates are eluding the common detection techniques or as a method alternative to the widely used radioactivity assays.",M1
15882071,"The use of (E)- and (Z)-phosphoenol-3-fluoropyruvate as mechanistic probes reveals significant differences between the active sites of KDO8P and DAHP synthases.The enzymes 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-2-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase catalyze a similar aldol-type condensation between phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and the corresponding aldose: arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), respectively. While KDO8P synthase is metal-dependent in one class of organisms and metal-independent in another, only a metal-dependent class of DAHP synthases has thus far been identified in nature. We have used catalytically active E and Z isomers of phosphoenol-3-fluoropyruvate [(E)- and (Z)-FPEP, respectively] as mechanistic probes to characterize the differences and/or the similarities between the metal-dependent and metal-independent KDO8P synthases as well as between the metal-dependent KDO8P synthase and DAHP synthase. The direct evidence of the overall stereochemistry of the metal-dependent Aquifex pyrophilus KDO8P synthase (ApKDO8PS) reaction was obtained by using (E)- and (Z)-FPEPs as alternative substrates and by subsequent (19)F NMR analysis of the products. The results reveal the si face addition of the PEP to the re face of the carbonyl of A5P, and establish that the stereochemistry of ApKDO8PS is identical to that of the metal-independent Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase enzyme (EcKDO8PS). In addition, both ApKDO8PS and EcKDO8PS enzymes exhibit high selectivity for (E)-FPEP versus (Z)-FPEP, the relative k(cat)/K(m) ratios being 100 and 33, respectively. In contrast, DAHP synthase does not discriminate between (E)- and (Z)-FPEP (the k(cat)/K(m) being approximately 7 x 10(-)(3) microM(-)(1) s(-)(1) for both compounds). The pre-steady-state burst experiments for EcKDO8PS showed that product release is rate-limiting for the reactions performed with either PEP, (E)-FPEP, or (Z)-FPEP, although the rate constants, for both product formation and product release, were lower for the fluorinated analogues than for PEP [125 and 2.3 s(-)(1) for PEP, 2.5 and 0.2 s(-)(1) for (E)-FPEP, and 9 and 0.1 s(-)(1) for (Z)-FPEP, respectively]. The observed data indicate substantial differences in the PEP subsites and open the opportunity for the design of selective inhibitors against these two families of enzymes.",M1
15772707,"Application of phosphoenolpyruvate into canine red blood cell cryopreservation with hydroxyethyl starch.Phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) is a phosphorylated glycolytic intermediate that can penetrate the RBC membrane and be metabolized to 2,3-DPG and ATP. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PEP treatment on canine red blood cells (RBCs) cryopreserved with 12.5% (w/v) HES. RBCs were incubated for 30, 60, and 90 min at 37 degrees C with PEP solution containing 60 mM mannitol, 30 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM adenine and 50 mM PEP (340 m osm/kg), pH 6.0 and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen with 12.5% (w/v) HES for 2 weeks. 2,3-DPG and saline stabilities of the PEP treated groups were increased and osmotic fragility indices were significantly decreased compared to the untreated control group. There were no differences in 2,3-DPG levels within the PEP treated groups with different PEP incubation times. These results suggest that PEP treatment may be beneficial for the cryopreservation of canine RBCs with HES.",M1
15752723,"Examination of MgATP binding in a tryptophan-shift mutant of phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus.A tryptophan-shift variant of Bacillus stearothermophilus phosphofructokinase (BsPFK), W179F/F76W, was constructed to evaluate the binding and allosteric characteristics associated with MgATP. W179F/F76W BsPFK has a specific activity of 77+/-1 U/mg at pH 7 and 25 degrees C, which is a 35% decrease compared to the wild-type enzyme. The K(m) for MgATP increases from 43+/-3 microM for wild-type BsPFK to 160+/-7 microM in the variant. Binding and allosteric interaction between Fru-6-P and <e>PEP</e> for the variant are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. W179F/F76W BsPFK has distinct fluorescence properties relative to wild-type or other tryptophan-shifted mutants of BsPFK. The binding of MgATP produces an 80% decrease in the fluorescence intensity while MgADP causes a 70% decrease. Capitalizing on these fluorescence changes, dissociation constants of 30+/-1 microM and 0.53+/-0.02 mM were measured for MgATP and MgADP, respectively.

15751977,"UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc) is a potent inhibitor of MurA (enolpyruvyl-UDP-GlcNAc synthase).Purified recombinant MurA (enolpyruvyl-UDP-GlcNAc synthase) overexpressed in Escherichia coli had significant amounts of UDP-MurNAc (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid) bound after purification. UDP-MurNAc is the product of MurB, the next enzyme in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. About 25% of MurA was complexed with UDP-MurNAc after five steps during purification that should have removed it. UDP-MurNAc isolated from MurA was identified by mass spectrometry, NMR analysis, and comparison with authentic UDP-MurNAc. Subsequent investigation showed that UDP-MurNAc bound to MurA tightly, with K(d,UDP)(-)(MurNAc) = 0.94 +/- 0.04 microM, as determined by fluorescence titrations using ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate) as an exogenous fluorophore. UDP-MurNAc binding was competitive with ANS and phosphate, the second product of MurA, and it inhibited MurA. The inhibition patterns were somewhat ambiguous, likely being competitive with the substrate <e>PEP</e> (phosphoenolpyruvate) and either competitive or noncompetitive with respect to the substrate UDP-GlcNAc (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine). These results indicate a possible role for UDP-MurNAc in regulating the biosynthesis of nucleotide precursors of peptidoglycan through feedback inhibition. Previous studies indicated that UDP-MurNAc binding to MurA was not tight enough to be physiologically relevant; however, this was likely an artifact of the assay conditions.",M1

15670601,"Crystal structure of the phosphoenolpyruvate-binding enzyme I-domain from the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis <e>PEP</e>: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS).Enzyme I (EI), the first component of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), consists of an N-terminal protein-binding domain (EIN) and a C-terminal PEP-binding domain (EIC). EI transfers phosphate from PEP by double displacement via a histidine residue on EIN to the general phosphoryl carrier protein HPr. Here, we report the 1.82A crystal structure of the homodimeric EIC domain from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, a saccharolytic eubacterium that grows optimally at 75 degrees C. EIC folds into a (betaalpha)(8) barrel with three large helical insertions between beta2/alpha2, beta3/alpha3 and beta6/alpha6. The large amphipathic dimer interface buries 3750A(2) of accessible surface area per monomer. A comparison with pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) reveals that the active-site residues in the empty PEP-binding site of EIC and in the liganded PEP-binding site of PPDK have almost identical conformations, pointing to a rigid structure of the active site. In silico models of EIC in complex with the Z and E-isomers of chloro-PEP provide a rational explanation for their difference as substrates and inhibitors of EI. The EIC domain exhibits 54% amino acid sequence identity with Escherichia coli and 60% with Bacillus subtilis EIC, has the same amino acid composition but contains additional salt-bridges and a more complex salt-bridge network than the homology model of E.coli EIC. The easy crystallization of EIC suggests that T.tengcongensis can serve as source for stable homologs of mesophilic proteins that are too labile for crystallization.",M1
15667207,"Crystal structures of pyruvate phosphate dikinase from maize revealed an alternative conformation in the swiveling-domain motion.Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) reversibly catalyzes the conversion of ATP, phosphate, and pyruvate into AMP, pyrophosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), respectively. Since the nucleotide binding site (in the N-terminal domain) and the pyruvate/PEP binding site (in the C-terminal domain) are separated by approximately 45 A, it has been proposed that an intermediary domain, called the central domain, swivels between these remote domains to transfer the phosphate. However, no direct structural evidence for the swiveling central domain has been found. In this study, the crystal structures of maize PPDK with and without PEP have been determined at 2.3 A resolution. These structures revealed that the central domain is located near the pyruvate/PEP binding C-terminal domain, in contrast to the PPDK from Clostridium symbiosum, wherein the central domain is located near the nucleotide-binding N-terminal domain. Structural comparisons between the maize and C. symbiosum PPDKs demonstrated that the swiveling motion of the central domain consists of a rotation of at least 92 degrees and a translation of 0.5 A. By comparing the maize PPDK structures with and without PEP, we have elucidated the mode of binding of PEP to the C-terminal domain and the induced conformational changes in the central domain.",M1

15568816,"Proton donor in yeast pyruvate kinase: chemical and kinetic properties of the active site Thr 298 to Cys mutant.The active site T298 residue of yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK), located in a position to serve potentially as the proton donor, was mutated to cysteine. T298C YPK was isolated and purified, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. Fluorescence and CD spectra indicate minor structural perturbations. A kinetic analysis of the Mg(2+)-activated enzyme demonstrates no catalytic activity in the absence of the heterotropic activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). In the presence of Mg(2+) and FBP, T298C has approximately 20% of the activity of wild-type (wt) YPK. The activator constant for FBP increases by 1 order of magnitude compared to this constant with the wt enzyme. T298C shows positive cooperativity by FBP with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 (wt, n(H,FBP) = 1). Mn(2+)-activated T298C behaves like Mn(2+)-activated wt YPK with a V(max) that is 20% of that for the wt enzyme with or without FBP. A pH-rate profile of T298C relative to that for wt YPK shows that pK(a,2) has shifted from 6.4 in wt to 5.5, indicating that the thiol group elicits an acidic pK shift. Inactivation of both wt and T298C by iodoacetate elicits a pseudo-first-order loss of activity with T298C being inactivated from 8 to 100 times faster than wt YPK. A pH dependence of the inactivation rate constant for T298C gives a value of 8.2, consistent with the pK for a thiol. Changes in fluorescence indicate that the T298C-Mg(2+) complex binds <e>PEP</e>, ADP, and both ligands together. This demonstrates that the lack of activity is not due to the loss of substrate binding but to the lack of ability to induce the proper conformational change. The mutation also induces changes in binding of FBP to all the relevant complexes. Binding of the metal and binding of PEP to the enzyme complexes are also differentially altered. Solvent isotope effects are observed for both wt and T298C. Proton inventory studies indicate that k(cat) is affected by a proton from water in the transition state and the effects are metal ion-dependent. The results are consistent with water being the active site proton donor. Active site residue T298 is not critical for activity but plays a role in the activation of the water and affects the pK that modulates catalytic activity.",M1
15543950,"Fasting-induced inhibition of collagen biosynthesis in rat skin. A possible role for phosphoenolpyruvate in this process.Fasting is accompanied by a decrease in collagen biosynthesis. The mechanism of this phenomenon involves inhibition of prolidase activity, an enzyme that plays a key role in upregulation of collagen metabolism. The mechanism of fasting-induced inhibition of prolidase activity is not known. Phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) is known as a strong inhibitor of prolidase activity. It exerts this effect by inhibition of the enzyme phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated prolidase is inactive. One may expect that fasting-associated increase in posphoenolpyruvate content in animal tissues may be a factor which inactivates prolidase and makes it inactive in collagen biosynthesis. We measured the levels of phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and pyruvate kinase in the skin of control and fasted rats and correlated these parameters with prolidase expression, prolidase activity and collagen biosynthesis in this tissue. Significant increase of PEP concentration (about 30%) was found in the skin of fasted rats. In the same time prolidase activity and collagen biosynthesis decreased by about 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to controls. It is known that phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate by the action of pyruvate kinase. Since fasting significantly decreases the activity of this enzyme, one may suggest that the accumulation of PEP is caused by a reduced utilisation of this metabolite. As demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis the decrease in prolidase activity was not accompanied by a decrease in the amount of the enzyme protein. Instead, a decrease in the enzyme phosphorylation was observed. The reduction in phosphorylation seems to be responsible for the decrease in prolidase activity. These data suggest that fasting-evoked accumulation of PEP reduces the activity of prolidase, providing a mechanism for inhibition of collagen biosynthesis in the skin.",M1
15516336,"Structural and mechanistic analysis of sialic acid synthase NeuB from Neisseria meningitidis in complex with Mn2+, phosphoenolpyruvate, and N-acetylmannosaminitol.In Neisseria meningitidis and related bacterial pathogens, sialic acids play critical roles in mammalian cell immunity evasion and are synthesized by a conserved enzymatic pathway that includes sialic acid synthase (NeuB, SiaC, or SynC). NeuB catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and N-acetylmannosamine, directly forming N-acetylneuraminic acid (or sialic acid). In this paper we report the development of a coupled assay to monitor NeuB reaction kinetics and an 18O-labeling study that demonstrates the synthase operates via a C-O bond cleavage mechanism. We also report the first structure of a sialic acid synthase, that of NeuB, revealing a unique domain-swapped homodimer architecture consisting of a (beta/alpha)8 barrel (TIM barrel)-type fold at the N-terminal end and a domain with high sequence identity and structural similarity to the ice binding type III antifreeze proteins at the C-terminal end of the enzyme. We have determined the structures of NeuB in the malate-bound form and with bound PEP and the substrate analog N-acetylmannosaminitol to 1.9 and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. Typical of other TIM barrel proteins, the active site of NeuB is located in a cavity at the C-terminal end of the barrel; however, the positioning of the swapped antifreeze-like domain from the adjacent monomer provides key residues for hydrogen bonding with substrates in the active site of NeuB, a structural feature that leads to distinct modes of substrate binding from other PEP-utilizing enzymes that lack an analogous antifreeze-like domain. Our observation of a direct interaction between a highly ordered manganese and the N-acetylmannosaminitol in the NeuB active site also suggests an essential role for the ion as an electrophilic catalyst that activates the N-acetylmannosamine carbonyl to the addition of PEP.",M1
15449293,"Analysis of in vivo kinetics of glycolysis in aerobic Saccharomyces cerevisiae by application of glucose and ethanol pulses.This article presents the dynamic responses of several intra- and extracellular components of an aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to glucose and ethanol pulses within a time window of 75 sec. Even though the ethanol pulse cannot perturb the glycolytic pathway directly, a distinct response of the metabolites at the lower part of glycolysis was found. We suggest that this response is an indirect effect, caused by perturbation of the NAD/NADH ratio, which is a direct consequence of the conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde. This effect of the NAD/NADH ratio on glycolysis might serve as an additional explanation for the observed decrease of 3PG, 2PG, and <e>PEP</e> during a glucose pulse. The responses measured during the ethanol pulse were used to evaluate the allosteric regulation of glycolysis. Our results confirm that FBP stimulates pyruvate kinase and suggest that this effect is pronounced. Furthermore, it appears that PEP does not play an important role in the allosteric regulation of phosphofructo kinase.",M1
15358051,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase: relevance of arginine 70 for catalysis.Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) carboxykinase is a key enzyme of the gluconeogenic pathway and catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP to yield PEP, ADP, and CO2 in the presence of a divalent metal ion. Previous experiments indicate that mutation of amino acid residues at metal site 1 decrease the enzyme catalytic efficiency and the affinity of the protein for PEP, evidencing the relevance of hydrogen-bond interactions between PEP and water molecules of the first coordination sphere of the metal ion for catalysis [Biochemistry 41 (2002) 12763]. To further understand the function of amino acid residues located in the PEP binding site, we have now addressed the catalytic importance of Arg70, whose guanidinium group is close to the PEP carboxyl group. Arg70 mutants of PEP carboxykinase were prepared, and almost unaltered kinetic parameters were found for the Arg70Lys PEP carboxykinase, while a decrease in 4-5 orders of magnitude for the catalytic efficiency was detected for the Arg70Gln and Arg70Met altered enzymes. To evaluate the enzyme interaction with PEP, the phosphopyridoxyl-derivatives of wild type, Arg70Lys, Arg70Gln, and Arg70Met S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase were prepared, and the change in the fluorescence emission of the probe upon PEP binding was used to obtain the dissociation equilibrium constant of the corresponding derivatized enzyme-PEP-Mn2+ complex. The titration experiments showed that a loss in 2.1 kcal/mol in PEP binding affinity is produced in the Arg70Met and Arg70Gln mutant enzymes. It is proposed that the electrostatic interaction between the guanidinium group of Arg70 and the carboxyl group of PEP is important for PEP binding and for further steps in catalysis.",M1
15277250,"Day-night changes of energy-rich compounds in crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species utilizing hexose and starch.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) can be divided into two groups according to the major carbohydrates used for malic acid synthesis, either polysaccharide (starch) or monosaccharide (hexose). This is related to the mechanism and affects energy metabolism in the two groups. In Kalanchoë pinnata and K. daigremontiana, which utilize starch, ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (tonoplast inorganic pyrophosphatase) activity is greater than inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (tonoplast adenosine triphosphatase) activity, but the reverse is the case in pineapple (Ananas comosus) utilizing hexose. To test the hypothesis that the energy metabolism of the two groups differs, day-night changes in the contents of ATP, ADP, AMP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in K. pinnata and K. daigremontiana leaves and in pineapple chlorenchyma were analysed. METHODS: The contents of energy-rich compounds were measured spectrophotometrically in extracts of tissue sampled in the light and dark, using potted plants, kept for 15 d before the experiments in a growth chamber. KEY RESULTS: In the three species, ATP content and adenylate energy charge (AEC) increased in the dark and decreased in the light, in contrast to ADP and AMP. Changes in ATP and AEC were greater in Kalanchoë leaves than in pineapple chlorenchyma. PPi content in the three species increased in the dark, but on illumination it decreased rapidly and substantially, remaining little changed through the rest of the light period. Pi content of Kalanchoë leaves did not change between dark and light, whereas Pi in pineapple chlorenchyma increased in the dark and decreased in the light, and the changes were far greater than in Kalanchoë leaves. Light-dark changes in PEP content in the three species were similar. CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate our hypothesis that day-night changes in the contents of energy-rich compounds differ between CAM species and are related to the carbohydrate used for malic acid synthesis.",M1
15276836,"Crystal structure of the reaction complex of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from Thermotoga maritima refines the catalytic mechanism and indicates a new mechanism of allosteric regulation.3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) catalyzes the first reaction of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in bacteria, fungi, and plants, the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and d-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) with the formation of DAHP. Crystals of DAHPS from Thermotoga maritima (DAHPS(Tm)) were grown in the presence of PEP and metal cofactor, Cd(2+), and then soaked with E4P at 4 degrees C where the catalytic activity of the enzyme is negligible. The crystal structure of the  frozen  reaction complex was determined at 2.2A resolution. The subunit of the DAHPS(Tm) homotetramer consists of an N-terminal ferredoxin-like (FL) domain and a (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel domain. The active site located at the C-end of the barrel contains Cd(2+), PEP, and E4P, the latter bound in a non-productive conformation. The productive conformation of E4P is suggested and a catalytic mechanism of DAHPS is proposed. The active site of DAHPS(Tm) is nearly identical to the active sites of the other two known DAHPS structures from Escherichia coli (DAHPS(Ec)) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DAHPS(Sc)). However, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DAHPS(Tm) are more similar to the functionally related enzyme, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDOPS) from E.coli and Aquiflex aeolicus, than to DAHPS(Ec) and DAHPS(Sc). Although DAHPS(Tm) is feedback-regulated by tyrosine and phenylalanine, it lacks the extra barrel segments that are required for feedback inhibition in DAHPS(Ec) and DAHPS(Sc). A sequence similarity search revealed that DAHPSs of phylogenetic family Ibeta possess a FL domain like DAHPS(Tm) while those of family Ialpha have extra barrel segments similar to those of DAHPS(Ec) and DAHPS(Sc). This indicates that the mechanism of feedback regulation in DAHPS(Tm) and other family Ibeta enzymes is different from that of family Ialpha enzymes, most likely being mediated by the FL domain.",M1
15208349,"The import of phosphoenolpyruvate by plastids from developing embryos of oilseed rape, Brassica napus (L.), and its potential as a substrate for fatty acid synthesis.The plastidial phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)/phosphate translocator (PPT) is expressed in the developing embryos of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). PEP can be imported by plastids isolated from embryos and used for fatty acid synthesis at rates that are sufficient to account for one-third of the rate of fatty acid synthesis in vivo. This provides the first experimental evidence for uptake of PEP and incorporation of carbon from it into fatty acids by plastids. PEP metabolism in isolated plastids is able to provide some of the ATP required for fatty acid synthesis. Expression of the PPT and related glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) translocator (GPT) is high in early embryo and leaf development and then declines. The marked decline in the abundance of PPT and GPT transcripts between the pre- and mid-oil accumulating stages of embryo development in B. napus does not correlate with the corresponding translocator activities, which both increase over the same period. This means that transcript abundance cannot be used to infer the activity of the translocators.",M1
15200387,"Characterization of N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase isoenzyme 1 from Campylobacter jejuni.Escherichia coli NeuNAc (N-acetylneuraminic acid) synthase catalyses the condensation of <e>PEP</e> (phosphoenolpyruvate) and ManNAc (N-acetylmannosamine) to form NeuNAc and is encoded by the neuB gene. Campylobacter jejuni has three neuB genes, one of which is very similar to the E. coli neuB gene. We have characterized the C. jejuni neuraminic acid synthase with respect to acylamino sugar specificity and stereochemistry of the PEP condensation. We determined the specificity of C. jejuni NeuNAc synthase for N-acetylmannosamine, N-butanoylmannosamine, N-propionoylmannosamine and N-pentanoylmannosamine. We find that, although this enzyme exhibits similar K(m) values for N-acylmannosamine molecules with different N-acyl groups, the kcat/K(m) values decreased with increasing chain length. NeuNAc synthase is a member of a PEP-utilizing family of enzymes that form oxo acids from PEP and a monosaccharide. This family includes KDO 8-P (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate) synthase and DAH 7-P (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate) synthase. Both enzymes catalyse the condensation of the re face of the aldehyde group of the monosaccharide with the si face of the PEP molecule. The C. jejuni NeuNAc synthase catalysed the condensation of Z- and E-[3-2H]PEP with ManNAc, yielding (3S)-3-deutero-NeuNAc and (3R)-3-deutero-NeuNAc respectively. The condensation of Z-[3-F]PEP and ManNAc yielded (3S)-3-fluoro-NeuNAc. Results of our studies suggest that the C. jejuni NeuNAc synthase, similar to KDO 8-P synthase and DAH 7-P synthase, catalyses the condensation of the si face of PEP with the aldehyde sugar. The present study is the first stereochemical analysis of the reaction catalysed by a bacterial NeuNAc synthase.",M1
15170343,"pH Dependence of the reaction catalyzed by avian mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.The pH dependence of the reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) provides significant insight into the chemical mechanism. The pH dependence of k(cat) shows the importance of two acidic ionizations with pK(a) values of 6.5 and 7.0 assigned to the active site metal ligands H249 and K228. A single basic ionization is observed with an apparent pK(a) value of 8.4 that is assigned to K275 that is located in the P-loop motif and is essential for phosphoryl transfer. The pH dependence of k(cat)/K(M,<e>PEP</e>) demonstrates the importance of the same two acidic ionizations in the interaction of phosphoenolpyruvate with PEPCK and a single basic ionization with a pK(a) value of 8.1 that is assigned to Y220. The interaction of Mg-IDP with PEPCK is dependent upon a single acidic ionization attributed to K228 and two basic ionizations, both having an average pK(a) value of 8.1. One of the basic ionizations is attributed to the P-loop lysine (K275) and the other to C273.",M1
15163516,"A novel cell-free protein synthesis system.An efficient cell-free protein synthesis system has been developed using a novel energy-regenerating source. Using the new energy source, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), protein synthesis continues beyond 2 h. In contrast, the reaction rate slowed down considerably within 30-45 min using a conventional energy source, phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) under identical reaction conditions. This improvement results in the production of twice the amount of protein obtained with PEP as an energy source. We have also shown that Gam protein of phage lambda, an inhibitor of RecBCD (ExoV), protects linear PCR DNA templates from degradation in vitro. Furthermore, addition of purified Gam protein in extracts of Escherichia coli BL21 improves protein synthesis from PCR templates to a level comparable to plasmid DNA template. Therefore, combination of these improvements should be amenable to rapid expression of proteins in a high-throughput manner for proteomics and structural genomics applications.",M1
15095130,"Induction of poplar leaf nitrate reductase: a test of extrachloroplastic control of isoprene emission rate.Several recent studies have suggested that control of isoprene emission rate is in part exerted by supply of extrachloroplastic phosphoenolpyruvate to the chloroplast. To test this hypothesis, we altered <e>PEP</e> supply by differential induction of cytosolic nitrate reductase (NR) and PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in plants of Populus deltoides grown with NO3- or NH4+ as the sole nitrogen source. Growth with 8 mM NH4+ produced a high leaf nitrogen concentration, compared with 8 mM NO3-, as well as slightly elevated rates of photosynthesis and significantly enhanced rates of isoprene emission and content of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis), chlorophyll (a+b) and carotenoids. Growth with 8 mM NO3- resulted in parallel reductions in both leaf isoprene emission rate and DMAPP. The differential effects of growth with NH4+ or NO3- were not observed when plants were grown with 4 mM nitrogen. The effects of reduced DMAPP availability were specific to isoprene emission and were not propagated to higher isoprenoids, as the correlations between nitrogen content and either leaf chlorophyll (a+b) or total carotenoids were unaffected by nitrogen source. Biochemical analysis revealed significantly higher levels of NR and PEPC activity in leaves of 8 mM NO3- -grown plants, consistent with their fundamental roles in nitrate assimilation. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that foliar assimilation of NO3- reduces isoprene emission rate by competing for carbon skeletons (mediated by PEPC) within the cytosol and possibly reductant within the chloroplast. Cytosolic competition for PEP is a major regulator of chloroplast DMAPP supply, and we offer a new  safety valve  hypothesis to explain why plants emit isoprene.",M1
15019786,"Substrate and metal complexes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism.3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthases are metal-dependent enzymes that catalyse the first committed step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in microorganisms and plants, the condensation of 2-phophoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and d-erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to DAHP. The DAHP synthases are possible targets for fungicides and represent a model system for feedback regulation in metabolic pathways. To gain further insight into the role of the metal ion and the catalytic mechanism in general, the crystal structures of several complexes between the tyrosine-regulated form of DAHP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and different metal ions and ligands have been determined. The crystal structures provide evidence that the simultaneous presence of a metal ion and PEP result in an ordering of the protein into a conformation that is prepared for binding the second substrate E4P. The site and binding mode of E4P was derived from the 1.5A resolution crystal structure of DAHP synthase in complex with PEP, Co2+, and the E4P analogue glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Our data suggest that the oxygen atom of the reactive carbonyl group of E4P replaces a water molecule coordinated to the metal ion, strongly favouring a reaction mechanism where the initial step is a nucleophilic attack of the double bond of PEP on the metal-activated carbonyl group of E4P. Mutagenesis experiments substituting specific amino acids coordinating PEP, the divalent metal ion or the second substrate E4P, result in stable but inactive Aro4p-derivatives and show the importance of these residues for the catalytic mechanism.",M1
15013784,"Entamoeba histolytica: kinetic and molecular evidence of a previously unidentified pyruvate kinase.We report the kinetic characterization of a previously unidentified pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in extracts from Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. This activity was about 74% of the activity of pyruvate phosphate dikinase. EhPK differed from most PKs in that its pH optimum was 5.5-6.5 and was inhibited by high <e>PEP</e> concentrations (1-5mM); these are concentrations at which PK is usually assayed. The optimal temperature was above 40 degrees C with negligible activity below 20 degrees C. EhPK exhibited hyperbolic kinetics with respect to both PEP (K(m) = 0.018 mM) and ADP (K(m) = 1.05 mM). However, it exhibited a sigmoidal behavior with respect to PEP at sub-saturating ADP concentrations. EhPK did not require monovalent cations for activity. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphate was a potent non-essential activator; it increased the affinity for ADP without modification of the V(max) or the affinity for PEP. Phosphate, citrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate significantly inhibited EhPK activity. A putative EhPK gene fragment found in EhDNA was analyzed. The data indicate that E. histolytica trophozoites contain an active PK, which might contribute to the generation of glycolytic ATP for parasite survival.",M1
15006638,"Substrate binding to fluorescent labeled wild type, Lys213Arg, and HIS233Gln Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases.Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) carboxykinase is a key enzyme of the gluconeogenic pathway and catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP to yield PEP, ADP, and CO(2) in the presence of a divalent metal ion. Previous experiments have shown that mutation of amino acid residues at metal site 1 decrease the steady-state affinity of the enzyme for PEP, suggesting interaction of PEP with the metal ion [Biochemistry 41 (2002) 12763]. To more completely understand this enzyme interactions with substrate ligands, we have prepared the phosphopyridoxyl (P-pyridoxyl)-derivatives of wild type, Lys213Arg, and His233Gln S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase and used the changes in the fluorescence probe to determine the dissociation equilibrium constants of PEP, ATPMn(2-), and ADPMn(1-) from the corresponding derivatized enzyme-Mn(2+) complexes. Homology modeling of P-pyridoxyl-PEP carboxykinase and P-pyridoxyl-PEP carboxykinase-substrate complexes agree with experimental evidence indicating that the P-pyridoxyl group does not interfere with substrate binding. ATPMn(2-) binding is 0.8kcalmol(-1) more favorable than ADPMn(1-) binding to wild type P-pyridoxyl-enzyme. The thermodynamic data obtained in this work indicate that PEP binding is 2.3kcalmol(-1) and 3.2kcalmol(-1) less favorable for the Lys213Arg and His233Gln mutant P-pyridoxyl-PEP carboxykinases than for the wild type P-pyridoxyl-enzyme, respectively. The possible relevance of N and O ligands for Mn(2+) in relation to PEP binding and catalysis is discussed.",M1
14766297,"Expression, purification, and characterization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase from Pyrococcus furiosus.The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the condensation reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). DAH7PS from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was insoluble but was partially solubilized as a dimer by the inclusion of 200 mM KCl in the cell lysis buffer. An effective two step purification procedure has been developed. The first step resulted in a high degree of purification and involved lysis by sonication at approximately 40 degrees C followed by a heat treatment at 70 degrees C. A continuous assay measuring the loss of PEP at 232 nm at elevated temperatures was also developed. Temperature, pH, and divalent metal ions all had an effect on the extinction coefficient of PEP. Purified recombinant P. furiosus DAH7PS is a dimer with a subunit Mr of 29,226 (determined by ESMS), shows resistance to denaturation by SDS, has activity over a broad pH range, and has an activation energy of 88 kJmol-1. The kinetic parameters are Km (PEP) 120 microM, Km (E4P) 28 microM, and kcat 1.5s-1, at 60 degrees C and pH 6.8. DAH7PS is not inhibited by phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. EDTA inactivates the enzyme and enzyme activity is restored by a wide range of divalent metal ions including (in order of decreasing effectiveness): Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+. This detailed characterization of the DAH7PS from P. furiosus raises the possibility that the subfamily Ibeta DAH7PS enzymes are metal ion dependent, contrary to previous predictions.",M1

We have successfully crystallized and solved the structure of unliganded, inhibitor-liganded and tetrahedral intermediate (TI)-liganded forms of Streptococcus pneumoniae EPSP synthase. The overall topology of the S. pneumoniae EPSP synthase is similar to that of the Escherichia coli EPSP synthase. In addition, the majority of residues responsible for ligand binding were conserved between the two proteins. TI-liganded structure provides absolute configuration of the C-2 atom from the F-<e>PEP</e> moiety of the enzyme-bound intermediate and also defines key residues responsible for the enzyme reaction. Comparison of the unliganded state and substrate-bound state of the enzyme provides insights into the structural mechanisms involved in dynamic events of ligand binding, domain movement and closure.

14675946,"Structure-based design of novel inhibitors of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase.3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) is the phosphorylated precursor of KDO, an essential sugar of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram negative bacteria. KDO8P is produced by a specific synthase (KDO8PS) by condensing arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), with release of inorganic phosphate. As KDO8PS is present in bacteria and plants, but not in mammalian cells, and mutations that inactivate KDO8PS also block cell replication, KDO8PS is a promising target for the design of new antimicrobials that act by blocking lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that a compound mimicking an intermediate of the condensation reaction is a good ligand and a powerful inhibitor. Here we report on the crystallographic investigation of the binding to KDO8PS of new derivatives of this original inhibitor. The structures of the enzyme in complex with these compounds, and also with the PEP analogs, 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2-PGA) and Z-methyl-PEP, point to future strategies for the design of novel inhibitors of KDO8PS.",M1

The enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase was used to prepare phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) from pyruvate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and orthophosphate. Then PEP was converted to phosphonopyruvate (Ppyr) with PEP mutase and then to Pald with Ppyr decarboxylase. By using [beta-32P]ATP or [2-14C]pyruvate as precursor, [32P]Pald or [1-14C]Pald was obtained, respectively. The utilization of the synthetic, radiolabeled Pald as a probe of enzyme mechanism was demonstrated with the enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (trivial name phosphonatase).

14526533,"[Central metabolism in Acinetobacter sp. grown on ethanol]The ethanol-grown cells of the mutant Acinetobacter sp. strain 1NG, incapable of producing exopolysaccharides, were analyzed for the activity of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and some biosynthetic pathways. In spite of the presence of both key enzymes (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) of the glyoxylate cycle, these cells also contained all enzymes of the TCA cycle, which presumably serves biosynthetic functions. This was evident from the high activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase and the low activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate was formed in the reaction catalyzed by oxaloacetate decarboxylase, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) was synthesized by the two key enzymes (PEP carboxykinase and PEP synthase) of gluconeogenesis. The proportion between these enzymes was different in the exponential and the stationary growth phases. The addition of the C4-dicarboxylic acid fumarate to the ethanol-containing growth medium led to a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the activity of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, as well as of fumarate hydratase, malate dehydrogenase, PEP synthase, and PEP carboxykinase (the activity of the latter enzyme increased by more than 7.5 times). The data obtained can be used to improve the biotechnology of production of the microbial exopolysaccharide ethapolan on C2-substrates.",M1
12963713,"A novel metabolic cycle catalyzes glucose oxidation and anaplerosis in hungry Escherichia coli.Complete oxidation of carbohydrates to CO2 is considered to be the exclusive property of the ubiquitous tricarboxylic acid cycle, the central process in cellular energy metabolism of aerobic organisms. Based on metabolism-wide in vivo quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes, we describe here complete oxidation of carbohydrates via the novel P-enolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-glyoxylate cycle, in which two PEP molecules are oxidized by means of acetyl coenzyme A, citrate, glyoxylate, and oxaloacetate to CO2, and one PEP is regenerated. Key reactions are the constituents of the glyoxylate shunt and PEP carboxykinase, whose conjoint operation in this bi-functional catabolic and anabolic cycle is in sharp contrast to their generally recognized functions in anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Parallel operation of the PEP-glyoxylate cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was identified in the bacterium Escherichia coli under conditions of glucose hunger in a slow-growing continuous culture. Because the PEP-glyoxylate cycle was also active in glucose excess batch cultures of an NADPH-overproducing phosphoglucose isomerase mutant, one function of this new central pathway may be the decoupling of catabolism from NADPH formation that would otherwise occur in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.",M1
12931002,"Opposing effects of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate with Mg(2+) on the conformational stability and dimerization of phosphotransferase enzyme I from Escherichia coli.The activity of enzyme I (EI), the first protein in the bacterial <e>PEP</e>:sugar phosphotransferase system, is regulated by a monomer-dimer equilibrium where a Mg(2+)-dependent autophosphorylation by PEP requires the homodimer. Using inactive EI(H189A), in which alanine is substituted for the active-site His189, substrate-binding effects can be separated from those of phosphorylation. Whereas 1 mM PEP (with 2 mM Mg(2+)) strongly promotes dimerization of EI(H189A) at pH 7.5 and 20 degrees C, 5 mM pyruvate (with 2 mM Mg(2+)) has the opposite effect. A correlation between the coupling of N- and C-terminal domain unfolding, measured by differential scanning calorimetry, and the dimerization constant for EI, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, is observed. That is, when the coupling between N- and C-terminal domain unfolding produced by 0.2 or 1.0 mM PEP and 2 mM Mg(2+) is inhibited by 5 mM pyruvate, the dimerization constant for EI(H189A) decreases from &gt; 10(8) to &lt; 5 x 10(5) or 3 x 10(7) M(-1), respectively. Incubation of the wild-type, dephospho-enzyme I with the transition-state analog phosphonopyruvate and 2 mM Mg(2+) also increases domain coupling and the dimerization constant approximately 42-fold. With 2 mM Mg(2+) at 15-25 degrees C and pH 7.5, PEP has been found to bind to one site/monomer of EI(H189A) with K(A)' approximately 10(6) M(-1) (deltaG' = -8.05 +/- 0.05 kcal/mole and deltaH = +3.9 kcal/mole at 20 degrees C); deltaC(p) = -0.33 kcal K(-1) mole(-1). The binding of PEP to EI(H189A) is synergistic with that of Mg(2+). Thus, physiological concentrations of PEP and Mg(2+) increase, whereas pyruvate and Mg(2+) decrease the amount of dimeric, active, dephospho-enzyme I.",M1

In this study, the regulation of the PEPCK-encoding gene pckA was examined through the evaluation of green fluorescent protein expression driven by the pckA promoter. The results showed that pckA was upregulated by acetate or palmitate but downregulated by glucose. Deletion of the pckA gene of Mycobacterium bovis BCG led to a reduction in the capacity of the bacteria to infect and survive in macrophages. Moreover, mice infected with DeltapckA BCG were able to reduce the bacterial load much more effectively than mice infected with the parental wild-type bacteria. This attenuated virulence was reflected in the degree of pathology, where granuloma formation was diminished both in numbers and degree. The data indicate that PEPCK activity is important during establishment of infection. Whether its role is in the gluconeogenic pathway for carbohydrate formation or in the conversion of PEP to OAA to maintain the TCA cycle remains to be determined.",M1
12846153,"Determination of enzymatic activity of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase by LC/MS.A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for determining the enzymatic activity of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase), an enzyme of the shikimate pathway, was developed. EPSP synthase catalyzes the formation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) from shikimate-3-phosphate (S-3-P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) in microorganisms and plants. The enzymatic activity of EPSP synthase was assessed by the determination of EPSP after a 30-min incubation with S-3-P and PEP using the LC/MS system. EPSP synthase activity is given in terms of the produced EPSP (pmol/min/mg protein). Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine)-tolerant EPSP synthase from the Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 (CP4-EPSP synthase) in genetically modified soybeans (GM-soybeans) was found to have an enzymatic activity of 736 EPSP pmol/min/mg protein in the presence of 3 nmol of S-3-P. In contrast, the enzyme activity of non-GM-soybeans was 21 EPSP pmol/min/mg protein. The EPSP synthase activity was markedly decreased in the non-GM-soybeans by the addition of glyphosate, but the enzyme activity of the GM-soybeans was only slightly decreased with this treatment. This LC/MS system could also be applicable to the measurement of EPSP synthase activity in different plant species and the detection of herbicide-tolerant EPSP synthase in GM foods.",M1
12795593,"Identification of the catalytic residues of AroA (Enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase) using partitioning analysis.AroA (EPSP synthase) catalyzes carboxyvinyl transfer through addition of shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P) to phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) to form a tetrahedral intermediate (THI), followed by phosphate elimination to give enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP). A novel approach, partitioning analysis, was used to elucidate the roles of catalytic residues in each step of the reaction. Partitioning analysis involved trapping and purifying [1-(14)C]THI, degrading it with AroA, and quantitating the products. Wild-type AroA gave a partitioning factor, f(PEP) = 0.25 +/- 0.02 at pH 7.5, where f(PEP) = [[1-(14)C]PEP]/([[1-(14)C]PEP] + [[1-(14)C]EPSP]). Eighteen mutations were made to 14 amino acids to discover which residues preferentially catalyzed either the addition or the elimination step. Mutating a residue catalyzing one step (e.g., addition) should change f(PEP) to favor the opposite step (e.g., elimination). No mutants caused large changes in f(PEP), with experimental values from 0.07 to 0.41. This implied that there are no side chains that catalyze only addition or elimination, which further implied that the same residues are general acid/base catalysts in both forward and reverse THI breakdown. Only Lys22 (protonating S3P hydroxyl or phosphate) and Glu341 (deprotonating C3 of PEP) are correctly situated in the active site. In the overall reaction, Lys22 would act as a general base during addition, while Glu341 would act as a general acid. Almost half of the mutations (eight of 18) caused a &gt;1000-fold decrease in specific activity, demonstrating that a large number of residues are important for transition state stabilization,  ensemble catalysis , in contrast to some enzymes where a single amino acid can be responsible for up to 10(8)-fold catalytic enhancement.",M1
12737564,"A combination chemical and enzymatic approach for the preparation of azole carboxamide nucleoside triphosphate.Alternative substrates for DNA and RNA polymerases offer an important set of biochemical tools. Many of the standard methods for nucleoside triphosphate synthesis fail in the cases of nonpurine and nonpyrimidine nucleosides. An efficient preparation of the 5'-O-tosylates for both the deoxy- and ribonucleosides enabled preparation of the diphosphate esters by displacement with tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate. Enzymatic synthesis of the azole carboxamide deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate was based on ATP as the phosphate donor, nucleoside diphosphate kinase as the catalyst, coupled with phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and pyruvate kinase as an ATP regeneration system. Ribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis required PEP as the phosphate donor and pyruvate kinase as the catalyst. An optimized purification procedure based upon boronate affinity gel was developed to yield highly purified nucleoside triphosphates. The strategy outlined here provides a new and efficient method for preparation of nucleoside 5'-triphosphate and is likely applicable to a broad variety of base and sugar modified nucleoside analogues.",M1
12716024,"Cytoprotection of pyruvic acid and reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide against hydrogen peroxide toxicity in neuroblastoma cells.Elevated production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the central nervous system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic reperfusion, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Pyruvic acid has a critical role in energy metabolism and a capability to nonenzymatically decarboxylate H2O2 into H2O. This study examined the effects of glycolytic regulation of pyruvic acid on H2O2 toxicity in murine neuroblastoma cells. Glycolytic energy substrates including D-(+)-glucose, D-(-) fructose and the adenosine transport blocker dipyridamole, were not effective in providing protection against H2O2 toxicity, negating energy as a factor. On the other hand, pyruvic acid completely prevented H2O2 toxicity, restoring the loss of ATP and cell viability. H2O2 toxicity was also attenuated by D-fructose 1,6 diphosphate (FBP), phospho (enol) pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), niacinamide, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (beta-NAD+), and reduced form (beta-NADH). Both FBP and PEP exerted positive kinetic effects on pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Interestingly, only pyruvic acid and beta-NADH exhibited powerful stoichiometric H2O2 antioxidant properties. Further, beta-NADH may exert positive effects on PK activity. Subsequent pyruvic acid accumulation can lead to the recycling of beta-NAD+ through lactate dehydrogenase and beta-NADH through glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It was concluded from these studies that intracellular pyruvic acid and beta-NADH appear to act in concert through glycolysis, to enhance H2O2 intracellular antioxidant capacity in neuroblastoma cells. Future research will be required to examine whether similar effects are observed in primary neuronal culture or intact tissue.",M1
12705838,"Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system: induced-fit protonation of the reaction transition state by Cys-502.Enzyme I (EI), the first component of the phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>):sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), consists of an N-terminal domain with the phosphorylation site (His-189) and a C-terminal domain with the PEP binding site. Here we use C3-substituted PEP analogues as substrates and inhibitors and the EI(C502A) mutant to characterize structure-activity relationships of the PEP binding site. EI(C502A) is 10 000 times less active than wild-type EI [EI(wt)] with PEP as the substrate, whereas the two forms are equally active with ZClPEP. Cys-502 acts as an acid-base catalyst which stereospecifically protonates the pyruvoyl enolate at C3. The electron-withdrawing chlorine of ZClPEP can compensate for the lack of Cys-502, and in this case, the released 3-Cl-enolate is protonated nonstereospecifically. Several PEP analogues were assayed as inhibitors and as substrates. The respective K(I)/K(m) ratios vary between 3 and 40 for EI(wt), but they are constant and around unity for EI(C502A). EI(wt) with PEP as the substrate is inhibited by oxalate, whereas EI(C502A) with ZClPEP is not. The different behavior of EI(wt) and EI(C502A) toward the PEP analogues and oxalate suggests that the PEP binding site of EI(wt) exists in a  closed  and an  open  form. The open to closed transition is triggered by the interaction of the substrate with Cys-502. The closed conformation is sterically disfavored by C3-modified substrate analogues such as ZClPEP and ZMePEP. If site closure does not occur as with EI(C502A) and bulky substrates, the transition state is stabilized by electron dispersion to the electron-withdrawing substituent at C3.",M1
12683839,"Inhibition mode of a bisubstrate inhibitor of KDO8P synthase: a frequency-selective REDOR solid-state and solution NMR characterization.In this report the mode of inhibition of mechanism-based inhibitor (2, K(i) = 0.4 microM) of 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS), which was designed to mimic the combined key features of its natural substrates arabinose-5-phosphate (A5P) and phoshoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) into a single molecule, was investigated. Our earlier solid-state NMR observations identified the inhibitor to bind in a way that partly mimics A5P, while the phosphonate moiety of its PEP-mimicking part exhibits no interactions with enzyme residues. This result was apparently in disagreement with the competitive inhibition of 2 against PEP and with the later solved crystal structure of KDO8PS-2 binary complex identifying the interactions of its PEP-mimicking part with the enzyme residues that were not detected by solid-state NMR. To solve this discrepancy, further solid-state REDOR NMR and (31)P solution NMR experiments were applied to a variety of enzyme complexes with the substrates and inhibitor. In particular, a novel frequency-selective REDOR experiment was developed and applied. Integration of the solution and solid-state NMR data clearly demonstrates that under conditions of stoichiometric enzyme-ligand ratio at thermodynamic equilibrium (a) PEP binding is unperturbed by the presence of 2 and (b) both PEP and 2 can bind simultaneously to the synthase, i.e., form a ternary complex with PEP occupying its own subsite and 2 occupying A5P's subsite. The latter observation suggests that under the conditions used in our NMR measurements, the inhibition pattern of 2 against PEP should have a mixed type character. Furthermore, the NMR data directly demonstrate the distinction between the relative binding strength of the two moieties of 2: enzyme interactions with PEP-mimicking moiety are much weaker than those with the A5P moiety. This observation is in agreement with KDO8PS-2 crystal structure showing only remote contacts of the phosphonate due to large structural changes of binding site residues. It is concluded that these phosphonate-enzyme interactions evidenced by both (31)P solution NMR and X-ray are too weak to be preserved under the lyophilization of KDO8PS-2 binary complex and therefore are not evidenced by the solid-state REDOR spectra.",M1
12667068,"The high-resolution structure of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase reveals a twist in the plane of bound phosphoenolpyruvate.3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS), the first enzyme of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants, catalyzes the aldol-like condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) and D-erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) with the formation of DAHP. The native and the selenomethionine-substituted forms of the phenylalanine-regulated isozyme [DAHPS(Phe)] from Escherichia coli were crystallized in complex with PEP and a metal cofactor, Mn(2+), but the crystals displayed disorder in their unit cells, preventing satisfactory refinement. However, the crystal structure of the E24Q mutant form of DAHPS(Phe) in complex with PEP and Mn(2+) has been determined at 1.75 A resolution. Unlike the tetrameric wild-type enzyme, the E24Q enzyme is dimeric in solution, as a result of the mutational perturbation of four intersubunit salt bridges that are critical for tetramer formation. The protein chain conformation and subunit arrangement in the crystals of E24Q and wild-type DAHPS are very similar. However, the interaction of Mn(2+) and PEP in the enzymatically active E24Q mutant complex differs from the Pb(2+)-PEP and Mn(2+)-phosphoglycolate interactions in two enzymatically inactive wild-type complexes whose structures have been determined previously. The geometry of PEP bound in the active site of the E24Q enzyme deviates from planarity due to a 30 degrees twist of the carboxylate plane relative to the enol plane. In addition, seven water molecules are within contact distance of PEP, two of which are close enough to its C2 atom to serve as the nucleophile required in the reaction.",M1
12628374,"The dual activity of pyruvate kinase type M2 from chromatin extracts of neoplastic cells.Pyruvate kinase type M(2) from Morris hepatoma 7777 tumour cell nuclei and cytosol, in contrast to types L and M(2) from nuclei and cytosol of normal rat liver, shows the histone H(1) kinase activity. Moreover, in the presence of L-cysteine and without ADP it converts 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) to pyruvate while in the presence of L-arginine or L-histidine does not. L-Cysteine markedly stimulates the activity of histone H(1) kinase transferring a phosphate group from PEP to, as results suggested, the epsilon -amino group of L-lysine of histone H(1). This, L-cysteine which is known to inhibit the activity of pyruvate kinase type M(2) from neoplastic cells transfering a phosphate from PEP to ADP, can act as a control factor champing the direction of enzymatic reaction in cancer cells.",M1
12612443,"Preventive effect of phosphoenolpyruvate on hypoxemia induced by oleic acid in Guinea pigs.Oleic acid-induced hypoxemia is an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Increased capillary permeability is a cause of hypoxemia in lung injury. Endothelial cells form a major capillary barrier, and disruption of the barrier appears to involve a decreased level of ATP in the cells. Phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) is an endogenous substance that is one of the ATP precursors and can cross some cell membranes via anion exchanger. We examined the effect of PEP on oleic acid-induced lung injury in guinea pigs. An intravenous injection of oleic acid (15 microl/kg) caused severe hypoxemia. Pretreatment with PEP at a dose of 2, 20, or 200 micromol/kg attenuated the oleic acid-induced decrease in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PEP attenuated the oleic acid-induced increase in vascular permeability in the proximal and distal bronchi, as indicated by the extravascular leakage of Evans Blue dye. The combination of PEP with ATP (4 micromol/kg) showed no additional inhibitory effect on oleic acid-induced lung injury, compared with PEP alone. We suggest that PEP is a promising candidate to prevent hypoxemia in acute lung injuries associated with increased vascular permeability, such as ARDS.",M1
12536254,"Metabolic flux redistribution in Corynebacterium glutamicum in response to osmotic stress.Osmotic stress constitutes a major bacterial stress factor in the soil and during industrial fermentation. In this paper, we quantified the metabolic response, in terms of metabolic flux redistribution, of a lysine-overproducing strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum grown under continuous culture, to gradually increasing osmolality. Oxygen and carbon dioxide evolution rates, and the changes in concentration of extracellular, as well as intracellular, metabolites were measured throughout the osmotic gradient. The metabolic fluxes were estimated from these measurements and from the mass balance constraints at each metabolite-node of the assumed metabolic reaction network. Our results show that formation rates of compatible solutes--trehalose first and proline at a later stage of the gradient--increased with osmotic stress to equilibrate the external osmotic pressure. Estimated flux distributions indicate that the observed increase in the glucose specific uptake rate with osmotic stress is channeled through the main energy generating pathways-- glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle--while the flux through the pentose phosphate pathway remains constant throughout the gradient. This results in a significant increase in the net specific ATP production rate, which may possibly be used to support the higher energy requirements required for cellular maintenance at high osmolalities. Finally, nodal analysis confirmed that the <e>PEP</e>/pyruvate node is essentially rigid and that the glucose-6-phosphate, oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate nodes are flexible and therefore adaptable to changes in osmotic pressure in C. glutamicum.",M1
12523647,"The effect of active site mutations in the oxaloacetate decarboxylase and pyruvate kinase-like activities of Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens His225Gln, Asp262Asn, Asp263Asn, and Thr249Asn phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases were analyzed for their oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and pyruvate kinase-like activities. The His225Gln and Asp263Asn enzymes showed increased Km values for Mn2+ and <e>PEP</e> compared with the native enzyme, suggesting a role of His225 and Asp263 in Mn2+ and PEP binding. No mayor alterations in Km values for oxaloacetate were detected for the varied enzymes. Alterations of His225, Asp262, Asp263, or Thr249, however, did not affect the Vmax of the secondary activities as much as they affected the Vmax for the main reaction. The results presented in this communication suggest different rate-limiting steps for the primary reaction and the secondary activities.",M1
12504250,"Effects of metabolites on the structural dynamics of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase.The activity of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) is regulated by metabolites. Besides requiring the presence of its substrates, <e>PEP</e> and ADP, the enzyme requires Mg(2+) and K(+) for activity. PK is allosterically inhibited by Phe for activity. The presence of PEP or Phe has opposing effects on the hydrodynamic properties of the enzyme without an apparent change in secondary structure. In this study, the structural perturbation induced by ligand binding was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the structural dynamics of PK was probed by H/D exchange monitored by FT-IR. Substrates and activating metal ions induce PK to assume a more dynamic structure while Phe exerts an opposite effect. In all cases there is no significant interconversion of secondary structures. PEP is the most efficient ligand in inducing a change in the microenvironments of both helices and sheets so much so that they can be detected spectroscopically as separate bands. These results provide the first evidence for a differential effect of ligand binding on the dynamics of structural elements in PK. Furthermore, the data support the model that allosteric regulation of PK is the consequence of perturbation of the distribution of an ensemble of states in which the observed change in hydrodynamic properties represent the two extreme end states.",M1
12441100,"Function of His185 in Aquifex aeolicus 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase.Aquifex aeolicus 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) catalyzes the condensation of arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) by favoring the activation of a water molecule coordinated to the active-site metal ion. Cys11, His185, Glu222 and Asp233 are the other metal ligands. Wild-type KDO8PS is purified with Zn(2+) or Fe(2+) in the active site, but maximal activity in vitro is achieved when the endogenous metal is replaced with Cd(2+). The H185G enzyme retains 8% of the wild-type activity. ICP mass spectrometry analysis indicates that loss of His185 decreases the enzyme affinity for Fe(2+), but not for Zn(2+). However, maximal activity is again achieved by substitution of the endogenous metal with Cd(2+). We have determined the X-ray structures of the Cd(2+) H185G enzyme in its substrate-free form, and in complex with PEP, and PEP plus A5P. These structures show a normal amount of Cd(2+) bound, suggesting that coordination by His185 is not essential to retain Cd(2+) in the active site. Nonetheless, there are significant changes in the coordination sphere of Cd(2+) with respect to the wild-type enzyme, as the carboxylate moiety of PEP binds directly to the metal ion and replaces water and His185 as ligands. These observations indicate that the primary function of His185 in A.aeolicus KDO8PS is to orient PEP in the active site of the enzyme in such a way that a water molecule on the sinister (si) side of PEP can be activated by direct coordination to the metal ion.",M1
12436256,"Streptomyces olivaceoviridis possesses a phosphotransferase system that mediates specific, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent uptake of N-acetylglucosamine.We recently described the ABC transporter Ngc (encoded by the ncgEFG operon) from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis, the first of its kind to be shown to transport N-acetylglucosamine and N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (chitobiose). A chromosomal mutant carrying a disruption of the ngcE gene, which encodes the sugar binding protein, was still able to transport N-acetylglucosamine. This phenotype can now be attributed to a functional phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). Two adjacent homologous genes, ptsC1 and ptsC2, were identified, and deduced to encode proteins which are 56% identical and can be predicted to contain eight transmembrane regions. PtsC1 (432 amino acids) and PtsC2 (403 residues) each correspond to a single EIIC domain; such domains are otherwise known only in several bacterial multidomain permeases for glucose/mannose or N-acetylglucosamine. The C-terminal sequences of PtsC1 and PtsC2 correspond to the motifs LKTPGREP and LPTRGRES, respectively. The ptsB gene located upstream of ptsC1 is predicted to encode a homologue of the EIIB domains usually found in bacterial multidomain permeases. Physiological and biochemical analyses of ngcE mutants carrying disruptive insertions in ptsC1 or ptsC2 or both revealed that, when grown on N-acetylglucosamine, the membrane component PtsC2, unlike PtsC1, mediates PEP-dependent, specific (K(m)=5 micro M) transport of N-acetylglucosamine, but not of other hexoses. Cross-complementation of membrane and cytoplasmic fractions from the various mutants led to the conclusion that S. olivaceoviridis also expresses the functional soluble components HPr, EI and EIIA of the PTS system. During growth on xylose, uptake of this pentose occurred if ptsC1 or ptsC2 was intact, but not in a mutant containing disrupted forms of both genes.",M1
12430021,"How the mutation glycine96 to alanine confers glyphosate insensitivity to 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Escherichia coli.The enzyme 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (EC 2.5.1.19) is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds in plants and microbes and is the unique target of the herbicide glyphosate. One of the first glyphosate-insensitive enzymes reported was a Gly96Ala mutant of EPSP synthase from Klebsiella pneumoniae. We have introduced this single-site mutation into the highly homologous EPSP synthase from Escherichia coli. The mutant enzyme is insensitive to glyphosate with unaltered affinity for its first substrate, shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P), but displays a 30-fold lower affinity for its second substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (<e>PEP</e>). Using X-ray crystallography, we solved the structure of Gly96Ala-EPSP synthase liganded with S3P to 0.17 nm resolution. The crystal structure shows that the additional methyl group from Ala96 protrudes into the active site of the enzyme. While the interactions between enzyme and S3P remain unaffected, the accessible volume for glyphosate binding is substantially reduced. Exploiting the crystallographic results for molecular modeling, we demonstrate that PEP but not glyphosate can be docked in the Gly96Ala-modified binding site. The predicted PEP binding site satisfies the earlier proposed interaction pattern for PEP with EPSP synthase and corroborates the assumption that glyphosate and PEP target the same binding site.",M1
12390023,"Reversible ligand-induced dissociation of a tryptophan-shift mutant of phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus.The biophysical properties of a tryptophan-shifted mutant of phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsPFK) have been examined. The mutant, designated W179Y/Y164W, has kinetic and thermodynamic properties similar to the wild-type enzyme. A 2-fold decrease in kcat is observed, and the mutant displays a 3-fold smaller K(0.5) for the substrate, fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), as compared to the wild-type enzyme. The dissociation constant for the inhibitor, phospho(enol)pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>), increases 2-fold, and the coupling parameter, Q(ay), decreases 2-fold. This suggests that while the mutant displays a slightly decreased affinity for PEP, PEP is still an effective inhibitor once bound. The new position of the tryptophan in W179Y/Y164W is approximately 6 A from the Fru-6-P portion of the active site. A 25% decrease in fluorescence intensity is observed upon Fru-6-P binding, and an 80% decrease in fluorescence intensity is observed with PEP binding. In addition, the intrinsic fluorescence polarization increases from 0.327 +/- 0.001 to 0.353 +/- 0.001 upon Fru-6-P binding, but decreases to 0.290 +/- 0.001 when PEP binds. Most notably, the presence of PEP induces dissociation of the tetramer. Dissociation of the tetramer into dimers occurs along the active site interface and can be monitored by the loss in activity or the loss in tryptophan fluorescence that is observed when the enzyme is titrated with PEP. Activity can be protected or recovered by incubating the enzyme with Fru-6-P. Recovery of activity is enzyme concentration dependent, and the rate constant for association is 6.2 +/- 0.3 M(-1) x s(-1). Ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that in the absence of PEP the mutant enzyme exists in an equilibrium between the dimer and tetramer forms with a dissociation constant of 11.8 +/- 0.5 microM, while in the presence of PEP the enzyme exists in equilibrium between the dimer and monomer forms with a dissociation constant of 7.5 +/- 0.02 microM. A 3.1 A crystal structure of the mutant enzyme suggests that the amino acid substitutions have not dramatically altered the tertiary structure of the enzyme. While it is clear that wild-type BsPFK exists as a tetramer under these same conditions, these results suggest that quaternary structural changes probably play an important role in allosteric communication.",M1
12241059,"Flux control of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system and the effect of diffusion.We analyzed the role of diffusion and cell size on the flux control properties of the glucose-PTS of Escherichia coli, in silicon cells under various metabolic conditions. To our surprise, the influence of the concentration of phosphoryl-donor <e>PEP</e> on the distribution of control was small. We found for cells of bacterial size that PTS-flux control was mainly located in processes taking place in the membrane and that diffusion hardly controlled the flux (&lt; 2.8 %). Enlargement of the cells shifted the control from membrane to cytoplasm and from process rates to diffusion rates, the latter now having a total control of about 38 %. In the presence of glucose, nearly all diffusion flux control resided in the component that links the cytoplasmic processes to those in the membrane.",M1

12204438,"Influence of inorganic pyrophosphate on the kinetics of muscle pyruvate kinase: a simple nonallosteric feedback model.Potassium pyrophosphate was used instead of ATP as a model ligand for magnesium cation for the study of effector influence on the kinetics of pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M(1). The pyruvate kinase activation by low concentration of pyrophosphate and inhibition by high concentration of pyrophosphate was considered to be the result of reversible reactions of magnesium cation with pyrophosphate, ADP, ATP, and <e>PEP</e>. The apparent K(m) and V(m) or in some cases the pseudo-first order reaction rate constant (instead of K(m) and V(m)) of pyruvate kinase at any given pyrophosphate concentration were analysed as a function of concentration of free magnesium cation and its complexes with all ligands present in an assay mixture. The functions of reaction parameters with respect to concentration of magnesium complexes indicate the coexistence in the reaction mixture of simple and mixed complexes of magnesium cation with substrates, pyrophosphate, and an enzyme-substrate complex. The parameters of the simulated reaction for the proposed interactions fit the measured experimental data. A simple model with nonallosteric feedback has been proposed. According to this model, mutual and simultaneous interactions of reaction products with substrates and with an enzyme result in the coexistence of simple and mixed, labile and inert complexes.",M1
12084063,"Synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate (<e>PEP</e>) analogues and evaluation as inhibitors of PEP-utilizing enzymes.The synthesis of 10 new phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) analogues with modifications in the phosphate and the carboxylate function is described. Included are two potential irreversible inhibitors of PEP-utilizing enzymes. One incorporates a reactive chloromethylphosphonate function replacing the phosphate group of PEP. The second contains a chloromethyl group substituting for the carboxylate function of PEP. An improved procedure for the preparation of the known (Z)- and (E)-3-chloro-PEP is also given. The isomers were obtained as a 4 : 1 mixture, resolved by anion-exchange chromatography after the last reaction step. The stereochemistry of the two isomers was unequivocally assigned from the (3)J(H-C) coupling constants between the carboxylate carbons and the vinyl protons. All of these and other known PEP-analogues were tested as reversible and irreversible inhibitors of Mg2+- and Mn2+- activated PEP-utilizing enzymes: enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), pyruvate kinase, PEP carboxylase and enolase. Without exception, the most potent inhibitors were those with substitution of a vinyl proton. Modification of the phosphate and the carboxylate groups resulted in less effective compounds. Enzyme I was the least tolerant to such modifications. Among the carboxylate-modified analogues, only those replaced by a negatively charged group inhibited pyruvate kinase and enolase. Remarkably, the activity of PEP carboxylase was stimulated by derivatives with neutral groups at this position in the presence of Mg2+, but not with Mn2+. For the irreversible inhibition of these enzymes, (Z)-3-Cl-PEP was found to be a very fast-acting and efficient suicide inhibitor of enzyme I (t(1/2) = 0.7 min).",M1

We show here that these variants are also highly susceptible to substrate-protectable inhibition by covalent modification of lysine with pyridoxal 5-phosphate. The chemical requirements of this interaction provide evidence that the gain-of-function phenotype results from the pairing of the uncompensated lysines in these mutants with the anionic carboxyl group of PEP.",M1

SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and gel filtration analyses indicated that this PK(p) exists as a 380-kDa heterohexamer composed of equal proportions of 64- (alpha-subunit) and 58-kDa (beta-subunit) polypeptides. The N-terminal sequence of the PK(p) alpha- and beta-subunits exhibited maximal identity with the corresponding regions deduced from putative PK genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Methylobacterium extorquens, respectively.

METHODS: Growth inhibition by PEP was analyzed using 3- 4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic cells were detected using Hoechest 33258 staining, and confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of cyclin A and B1 were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot. Annexin V assay was measured by flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: PEP induced apoptosis and then inhibited cell proliferation in liver carcinoma cell line Bel-7402. Cells treated with PEP 50 mumol/L for 15 h were arrested in G2-phase with dramatical expression of cyclin A and a little change in cyclin B1.

15051425,"A new animal model of continuous catheterization for investigating mechanisms of arteritis associated with chemotherapy.Although superselective continuous intra-arterial infusion has advantages for cancer therapy, intra-arterial chemotherapy is often interrupted by arterial damage due to arteritis. Therefore, an animal model must be developed to elucidate the mechanism of arteritis associated with continuous anti-cancer drug infusion. We developed a new rat model with which to investigate the causal mechanism(s) of vascular damage associated with continuous catheterization chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic agents (fluorouracil (5-FU) or peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>)) were continuously administered for 7 days into the abdominal aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats through a catheter fixed in situ. We found that the incidence of apoptotic endothelial cells of the aorta was higher nearer the tip of the catheter. The incidence of apoptosis was higher in the group treated with 5-FU than with PEP.

11862552,"X-ray absorption spectroscopic investigation of Fe(II)-peplomycin and peplomycin derivatives: the effect of axial ligation on Fe-pyrimidine back-bonding.X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used to study ferrous complexes of a bleomycin (BLM) congener, peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), and two of its derivatives, iso-peplomycin (ISO) and depyruvamide peplomycin (DP), in which potential axial ligands have been perturbed and removed, respectively. Application of extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis shows an elongation of the short-distance component of the first coordination sphere in DP and ISO relative to PEP. The XAS pre-edge intensity concomitantly decreases with increased axial perturbation. The short-distance component of PEP is correlated to the Fe-pyrimidine bond and is related to the amount of pi-back-bonding.

To prevent PF and to administer PEP safely, we examined the influence of PEP on pulmonary function in 135 patients who underwent concomitant chemo (PEP + 5-FU)-radio (60Co) therapy and pulmonary function tests. In the inductive therapy, 5 mg of PEP was intramuscularly injected three times a week and a total of 41.6 +/- 14.3 mg was administered. Of the patients, 98 received oral azelastine hydrochloride (AZH, 4 mg/day) during the inductive therapy with the aim of prophylaxis of PF. The oxygen partial pressure in arterial blood (PaO2) only slightly decreased from 84.2 +/- 12.1 mmHg before treatment to 82.8 +/- 12.5 mmHg after treatment, while, carbon oxide diffusion (%DLco) decreased after treatment in most patients (p &lt; 0.001, by paired t test) with mean values before treatment of 106.3 +/- 24.5% and after treatment 99.5 +/- 24.9%. The decrease of %DLco was associated with the dose of PEP until about 40 mg but further decreases of %DLco were not prominent. In the patients who underwent oral AZH, the decrease of %DLco weaker than that in patients without AZH: the decrease rates of %DLco in the former and latter were 4.3 +/- 9.4% and 14.1 +/- 15.9%, respectively. From the chest X-ray examination, mild PF was suspected in three patients but no advancement of PF or clinical symptoms were observed. From these results, it was concluded first that %DLco is more useful than PaO2 as the predisposing risk factor for PF, second that the decrease of %DLco depends on the dose of PEP until about 40 mg, third that AZH is expected to inhibit PEP-induced PF, and fourth that a small dose (20-40 mg) of PEP can be administered without inducing PF if care is exercised as to the patient's age, general condition and the value of %DLco in the use of PEP.",M2
11410798,"Correlation between EGF receptor expression and peplomycin cytotoxicity in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.The relationship between sensitivity to anti-cancer agents and EGF receptor expression on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells was investigated.

Addition of TNFalpha increased the number of EGF receptors in the SCC cell lines 1.5- to 2-fold. The cytotoxic effect of combined administration of PEP and TNFalpha was correlated with the number of EGF receptors, and produced a 2- to 5-fold increase in IC50 compared with administration of PEP alone. These observations suggest that EGF receptor expression is closely associated with the cytotoxic effect of PEP on SCC cells.",M2

9780659,"[The growing teratoma syndrome: report of a case]A 32-year-old man presented with a swelling of the left testis, for which he underwent high inguinal orchiectomy. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed teratocarcinoma. Further evaluation revealed no metastasis (stage I), and he was followed-up by monthly examination without prophylactic chemotherapy (surveillance). Thirteen months after orchiectomy, AFP and hCG-beta were elevated at 133.8 ng/ml and 0.8 ng/ml respectively. Abdominal CT scan revealed para-aortic masses of recurrent tumor. Although the AFP and hCG-beta levels markedly declined after five courses of COMPE (CDDP, VCR, MTX, <e>PEP</e>, Etoposide) chemotherapy, the retroperitoneal masses had further enlarged and had undergone cystic change. Excision of the residual tumors was performed, and microscopic examination of specimens revealed mature teratoma without malignant components. The diagnosis of the growing teratoma syndrome was therefore made. The growing teratoma syndrome occurs in nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors following chemotherapy and is characterized by enlargement of metastatic lesions with normal tumor marker levels. Total surgical resection of the mass yields good results, and tumor is unresponsive to chemotherapy. Early recognition of this syndrome is important for successful treatment.",M2
9254594,"Interactions of deglycosylated cobalt(III)-pepleomycin (green form) with DNA based on NMR structural studies,.Pepleomycin (<e>PEP</e>)1 is a metalloglycopeptide antitumor antibiotic that has improved pharmacological properties than does bleomycin (BLM). Both PEP and BLM bind to and degrade DNA in a sequence-selective manner. The binding interactions of HO2--Co(III)-CodPEP (CodPEP) with CGTACG have been studied by 2D NMR and molecular modeling. Inspection of the 2D-NMR data revealed 60 notable intermolecular NOEs between CodPEP and CGTACG which place the drug's metal binding domain and peptide linker in the minor groove of the DNA close to G8 and T9. On the basis of the NOEs, the drug's DNA binding domain is located close to the T9.A4 and A10.T3 base pairs. Intercalation of the bithiazole tail between these base pairs is indicated by the loss of DNA symmetry upon complexation with CodPEP, by a break in the sequential connectivity at the TpA steps, and by the upfield shift of the bithiazole H-H5 and H-H5' proton resonances. Intercalation of the bithiazole moiety unfolds the CodPEP molecule and exposes its hydroperoxide group to the DNA. The hydroperoxide group in the refined model of CodPEP-CGTACG is close to the C4' proton of T9, consistent with cleavage at this position. The NOE pattern between the pyrimidine ring of CodPEP and G8 of DNA suggests a specific pairing recognition via hydrogen bonds between these groups, thus establishing a 5'-GT-3' sequence preference. The structural elucidation of the free CodPEP and CoPEP [Caceres-Cortes et al. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 818-828], and of the complex of CodPEP-CGTACG afford a plausible mechanism for the recognition and its subsequent cleaving of DNA by the drug. The process involves the unfolding of the compact CodPEP, recognition of a guanine base using the metal binding domain, threading of the bithiazole tail between base pairs, and finally positioning of the HO2- group close to the T or C found 3' to the specific G site.",M2
9279346,"[Evaluation of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for oral squamous cell carcinoma]In the present study, we investigated the clinical and histopathological effects of CP therapy consisting of cisplatin (CDDP 50 mg/m2) or carboplatin (CBDCA 300 mg/m2) and peplomycin (<e>PEP</e> 5 mg/day) for 25 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. The effects of treatment and associated complications were as follows: 1) Complete response (CR) was achieved in 8 and partial response (PR) in 14 of the 25 cases. The overall clinical response rate was 88%. The histological response rate was 64%. 2) The clinical effects were not always consistent with the histopathological effects. There were discrepancies between the clinical and histopathological effects, especially in PR determined by clinical findings. 3) The principal adverse reaction was gastro-intestinal disturbances, but symptoms were able to be controlled. Signs of hematologic toxicity and renal disturbance were mild and did not preclude the continuance of therapy. The results of this study indicated that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP and PEP was highly effective for the local control of oral squamous cell carcinoma.",M2
9108252,"Structures of cobalt(III)-pepleomycin and cobalt(III)-deglycopepleomycin (green forms) determined by NMR studies.Pepleomycin (<e>PEP</e>) is a metalloglycopeptide that has stronger anticancer activity and less pulmonary toxicity than bleomycin (BLM). PEP, like BLM, exerts its action by binding to and degrading DNA in the presence of oxygen and certain metals. Obtaining detailed structural information of PEP and PEP-DNA complexes is crucial to understanding its anticancer activity. The structures of two green forms of cobalt-PEP species, HO2-Co(III)-PEP (denoted CoPEP) and deglycosylated HO2-Co(III)-PEP (denoted CodPEP) have been obtained by NOE restrained refinements. Earlier studies of the related HO2-Co(III)-BLM A2 proposed that two chiral conformers (form A or B) could exist with either the beta-aminoalanine primary amine (A,NH2) or the mannose carbamoyl nitrogen (M,NH2) as the axial ligand. Analysis of our NOESY data shows convincingly that form A is the most probable conformer with the mannose carbamoyl M,NH2 and the beta-aminoalanine primary amine A,NH2 as the axial ligands in CoPEP and CodPEP, respectively. The NOE cross-peaks resulting from the interactions between the N-terminus (i.e., the metal-binding domain) and the C-terminus of CoPEP and CodPEP have similar patterns, suggesting that they both adopt compact structures with the bithiazole group folded back over the N-terminus.",M2
9024927,"In vitro effects of hyperthermia combined with cisplatin or peplomycin on the human maxillary carcinoma cell line IMC-2.We examined the interactive effects of hyperthermia combined with cisplatin (CDDP) (0.5 micrograms/ml) or peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>) (1.0 microgram/ml) on surviving fractions of human maxillary carcinoma IMC-2 cells. Either CDDP or PEP enhanced the 44 degree C thermosensitivity of thermotolerant cells after heating at 42 degrees C for 2 hours. The development of thermotolerance at 42 degrees C with either of the two drugs for 2 hours was not inhibited by CDDP, but it was partially inhibited by PEP. Moreover, for PEP throughout the entire period of 42-44 degrees C step-up heating, the 44 degree C thermosensitivity of thermotolerant cells after heating at 42 degrees C with PEP for 2 hours was enhanced similarly to that at 44 degrees C with PEP. Heating at 42 degrees C combined with either of the two drugs showed a marked interactive effect.",M2
9300977,"Epinephrine or peplomycin combined with hyperthermia in irradiated Lewis lung carcinoma: effects on tumor growth, skin reaction, and lung metastasis.Although hyperthermia potentiates the effect of radiation, the combined effect decreases as the time between irradiation and hyperthermia increases. The purpose of this study was to prevent the rapid loss of efficacy by the local injection of epinephrine or peplomycin(<e>PEP</e>), two agents known as hyperthermic potentiators. In this study, Lewis lung carcinoma implanted in the foot of BDF1 mice was used for the assessment of tumor growth, skin reactions, and lung metastasis. The tumors were irradiated, then warmed in a water bath for 45 min. The retarding effects of hyperthermia on tumor growth and skin reactions were lost 2 days after irradiation. However, when PEP or epinephrine was injected before hyperthermia, tumor growth was distinctly delayed. The effect of epinephrine was greater than PEP and still showed enhancement 8 days after irradiation. For skin reactions, no significant enhancing effect was observed. Lung metastasis was significantly inhibited by the addition of epinephrine either 0 or 2 days after irradiation. In conclusion, the local administration of epinephrine combined with hyperthermia significantly retarded tumor growth without an increase in skin reactions or lung metastases. Possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon was discussed.",M2

8841505,"Effects of sequence and temperature of hyperthermia and peplomycin on human pharyngeal carcinoma KB cells in vitro.To maximize the interactive effect, we examined the time sequence of high (above 43 degrees C) or low (below 43 degrees C)-hyperthermia and peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>)(0.5 microgram/ml). Simultaneous or post-hyperthermic PEP treatment at 44 degrees C resulted in a slight synergistic effect with thermoenhancement ratios (TER) of 1.30 or 1.34, respectively. However, at 42 degrees C, maximal interaction was obtained (TER = 10.19) when KB cells were simultaneously heated with PEP. Furthermore, pre-treatment at 44 degrees C for 25 min or 42 degrees C for 4 h enhanced PEP cytotoxicity more than that of post-treatment at 44 degrees C for 25 min or 42 degrees C for 4 h, respectively. However, chemoenhancement ratios (CER) of pre-treatment at 44 degrees C for 25 min and at 42 degrees C for 4 h were 19.1 and 3.5, respectively, although the isothermic dose decreased the cell count to 60% in both cases. These results indicated that simultaneous or post-hyperthermic PEP treatment with high-hyperthermia, and simultaneous PEP treatment with low-hyperthermia, are the most effective means of PEP thermochemotherapy with hyperthermia.",M2
8676007,"Preoperative thermochemotherapy of oral cancer using magnetic induction hyperthermia (Implant Heating System: IHS).Eight patients with primary cancer of the oral cavity were preoperatively treated by combined treatment with hyperthermia and chemotherapy. They received two courses of chemotherapy, which included intra-arterial infusion of 100 mg of cisplatin (CDDP) and 25 mg of peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>) via the superficial temporal artery. The patients also received interstitial hyperthermia for 45 min once a week using the Implant Heating System (IHS) with chemotherapy. IHS consists of ferromagnetic implant, induction coil and generator to produce high frequency magnetic field. The ferromagnetic implant is made of Fe-Pt alloy (Fe: 73%, Pt: 27%), and has a Curie temperature of 68 degrees C. As a result, clinical complete response (CR) was observed in seven patients and partial response (PR) in one, and postoperative pathological examination showed no residual tumour cells in any specimen. Combined interstitial hyperthermia by IHS and chemotherapy is thus found to be an effective therapeutic method for treating oral cancers.",M2

As the primary clinical effect, complete response (CR) was observed in three cases, partial response (PR) in 20 cases, minor response (MR) in six cases and no change (NC) in two cases, with a clinical response rate of 74.2%. The histopathological effects of the chemotherapy in the following cases showed these histological Grades: 0 or I in four cases, IIa in 12 cases, IIb in eight cases, III in six cases and IV in one case. Fifteen of the 31 patients who received PP therapy showed a histological Grade of IIb or better, representing 48.4% of the histopathological response rate. With regard to the mode of invasion of the tumor, the histopathological response rate was 90.0% in patients with invasive Grades 1 and 2, 41.7% in those with invasive Grade 3 and 16.7% in those with invasive Grade 4C. There were no patients with invasive Grade 4D in whom the therapy was histopathologically effective. In other words, the histopathological effect significantly decreased as the invasive Grade increased. With regard to the relationship between clinical effects and histopathological effects, there was one CR patient who showed a histological Grade of IIa. Thus, it is noteworthy that clinical effects were not necessarily consistent with post-chemotherapeutic histopathological effects.",M2

The clinical value of IV-COMPA chemotherapy was evaluated based on the results of 24 patients with urothelial cancers. From October 1989 through October 1993, a total of 24 patients (20 males and 4 females) received IV-COMPA chemotherapy at Tokyo Medical College Hospital and Tokyo Medical College Hachioji Medical Center. All patients had advanced transitional cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the urothelial tract (renal pelvis, ureter or bladder). One course of IV-COMPA was delivered at 2-week intervals and consisted of 30 mg/m2 CDDP on day 4 and 5, 0.6 mg/m2 VCR (Oncovin) on day 1 and 2, 5 mg/m2 MTX on day 2 and 3, 5 mg/m2 <e>PEP</e> on day 1, 2 and 3, 20 mg/m2 ADM on day 4. A few patients received the same regimen without peplomycin called IV-COMA to avoid pulmonary fibrosis. Fifteen patients with surgically confirmed invasive carcinoma were defined by at least 1 of the following criteria: multiple tumors or size greater than 5 cm, grade 3, stage P3 or P4, pN+, pR1, pL1, pV1, or secondary carcinoma in situ. These patients were treated with 2 or 3 corpses of postoperative IV-COMPA chemotherapy to improve prognosis. In this group, 14 of 15 (93%) are alive at a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 8-57 months) and actuarial survival rates of 1 and 3 years were 100%, 90.9%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
7594755,"A biochemical evaluation of oral squamous cell carcinoma growth by measurement of specific activity of succinate dehydrogenase in the subrenal capsule assay.An auxiliary method for determination of chemosensitivity with the subrenal capsule assay (SRCA) was developed in which the specific activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SD) of tumor implanted beneath the renal capsule is measured. The appropriate conditions for measuring the specific activity of SD were determined. The chemosensitivity of tumors, derived from six xenograft lines originating from oral squamous cell carcinomas, to peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were evaluated by the SRCA and the nude mouse assay (NMA). The chemosensitivity evaluated by NMA displayed a higher degree of correlation with that determined by the improved SRCA than with that determined by the conventional SRCA. The correlations between overall accuracy of prediction with the NMA and those with the conventional SRCA and the improved SRCA were 72.2% and 88.9%, respectively. These findings suggest that our new assay may be useful for evaluation of chemosensitivity in the SRCA.",M2

The hypoxic cells are resistant to anticancer drugs and thought to be one of the causes of recurrence. We examined effects of anticancer drugs on the hypoxic cells using HEp-2 human laryngeal cell line. Anticancer drugs, CDDP, peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), 5-FU, THP-adriamycin (THP-ADR), and adriamycin (ADR), were incubated with cells in hypoxic condition (5% CO2 and 95% N2) for 72 hours. Drug effects were measured by proliferation rates (IC50). IC50 of PEP increased 22.89 folds in hypoxic cells. IC50 of CDDP and 5-FU also increased 1.86 and 2.27 folds respectively. However, IC50 of THP-ADR and ADR remained same in the hypoxic cells. It was proved that THP-ADR and ADR were effective for the hypoxic cells. The combination effect with THP-ADR and CDDP or PEP were more than additive against the hypoxic cells. It was suggested that the combination with THP-ADR and CDDP or PEP are effective for head and neck cancer which contains hypoxic cell compartment.",M2

Macroscopic changes on the thigh skin of male ICR hairless mice (at 8 weeks of age) induced by 10 Gy X-ray irradiation alone and the combined treatment with the anticancer substances were estimated by a modified scoring first reported by Lowy and Baker. Intraperitoneal administration of PEP significantly enhanced radiation skin injury; while CPT-11 (15 mg/kg), within the clinical dose range and in the similar molarities to that of PEP, did not show any appreciable modification effect. Treatment with CPT-11 (50 mg/kg) showed a radiation enhancement without significant difference. The chemotherapeutic radioenhancement ratios of the combined treatments of X-ray and PEP or CPT-11 (15 or 50 mg/kg) were 1.49, 1.17 or 1.34, respectively. Treatment with PEP at the accepted dose showed a radiation enhancement, while CPT-11 did not show any radiation enhancement within the clinical dose.",M2

8185331,"[Experimental studies on immunotargeting therapy for esophageal carcinoma]We produced two types of murine monoclonal antibodies, KYSM-1 and KIS-1, against human squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus for quantitative diagnosis and optimum therapy. The isotypes of KYSM-1 and KIS-1 were IgM and IgG1, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that both antibodies strongly reacted with human carcinoma cell lines of the esophagus, lung and oral cavity. Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that each antigen of KYSM-1 and KIS-1 exposed to cellular membrane of squamous carcinoma cells and molecular weights of these antigens detected by KYSM-1 and KIS-1 were 60 kDa and 90 kDa, respectively, in non-reduced condition. These 2 monoclonal antibodies were labeled with 125I by the Iodogen method, and each antibody was injected into nude mice with human squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Regarding in vivo accumulation of 125I-labeled antibodies, however, KIS-1 alone showed significantly high values in the tumor at 5 and 7 days after the injection. From this result, KIS-1 was labeled with 131I and injected into the tumor-bearing mice with a dose of 200 microCi. Moderately effective results were found in the tumor by 14 days after the injection. Furthermore, KIS-1 was also conjugated to peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>). In in vitro and in vivo effects of targeting chemotherapy, the conjugates killed human squamous carcinoma cells and tumor-implanted nude mice. These results suggest that the 131I-labeled KIS-1 and/or KIS-1-PEP conjugate may provide a targeting therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.",M2

The cells in the logarithmic growth were treated with PEP (1.25 micrograms/ml) for 24 hr, during the first 4 hr of which they were pulse-labeled with 3H-TdR (2.4 x 10(4) Bq/ml). After washing with PBS, the cells were then cultured without both PEP and 3H-TdR, fixed at different times and stained with propidium iodide (PI) for the auto-stage cytofluorometry, which enabled DNA content analysis for labeled and unlabeled cells by repeated scanning of the same cell population. The nuclear DNA content histograms demonstrated that A431 cells were mostly arrested in G2 phase of 4C stem line by treatment with PEP for 24 hr. This G2 block lasted up to 8 hr after removal of the drug, and thereafter, marked polyploidization associated with DNA synthesis occurred, showing almost no mitotic figures, while only a few cells returned to G1 phase via M phase. During the period of 72-120 hr, however, the fractions of advanced polyploid cells (DNA content &gt; or = 8C) gradually decreased and the DNA content distribution pattern became eventually similar to the original one as seen before PEP treatment. From these results we hypothesized as follows: 1) At S-G2 boundary, there is some control mechanism that checks whether the cells, after S phase, can enter the M phase or not. 2) The cells, which are not permitted to enter mitosis by the control mechanism, show marked polyploidization. 3) Only the cells that enter into mitosis can live and proliferate, though the advanced polyploid cells die shortly. 4) This control mechanism might be related to the precision of DNA repair that is checked at the G2-M checkpoint.",M2

Chemosensitivity to peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), CDDP and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) evaluated SSDI method and nude mouse assay showed a high correlation than those evaluated by TGIR method and nude mouse assay. The overall predictive accuracy compared with nude mouse assay was 72.2% by TGIR method and 88.9% by SSDI method. SSDI method seemed to be a useful method to evaluate the chemosensitivity in SRCA.",M2
1374308,"Experimental and clinical evaluation by flow cytometry for the mechanism of combination therapy (cisplatin and peplomycin).Pharmacologic effects of cisplatin (CDDP) and peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>) on tumor cell kinetics were studied both in vitro and in vivo with the aid of flow cytometry (FCM). Double staining with propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to analyze the cell cycle, and the number of viable cells was determined with fluorescein diacetate (FDA). Effects of combining the 2 agents were also studied to establish the most effective method of combination therapy. Furthermore, these agents were tried clinically on the basis of experimental results. Results showed that CDDP exerted its action at the S and G2M phases in the cell cycle and PEP at the G2M phase. Among the combination regimens in the experiments with CDDP, PEP, and CDDP + PEP as analyzed by FCM, the strongest block on the G2M phase was shown in the one at a 2-day interval, resulting in the most effective killing of the tumor cells. Clinical trial of the combination therapy showed the same results as the in vitro experiment; the therapy proved useful for improving the patient's clinical condition and the results obtained with CT imaging and pathology.",M2

1723259,"Targeted killing of squamous carcinoma cells by a monoclonal antibody-peplomycin conjugate which recognizes the EGF receptor.We determined in vitro the antitumor activity of a conjugate prepared by binding a monoclonal antibody (B4G7), which recognizes the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, with peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), which is an antitumor agent effective against squamous cell carcinoma. This B4G7-PEP conjugate was prepared by coupling of B4G7 and carboxymethylpeplomycin active ester. The conjugate killed A431 cells of squamous cell carcinoma which overexpress EGF receptors at lower concentrations than PEP alone. On the basis of its IC50, the conjugate was six times more potent than PEP alone. A simple mixture of B4G7 and PEP was as effective as PEP alone in cytotoxicity. The addition of ten times the amounts of B4G7 to this conjugate decreased its cytotoxicity. When other squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with different levels of EGF receptors (NA, Ca9-22, TE-1, TE-8) were treated with the conjugate, cells were killed dose-dependently and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the number of EGF receptors. When each squamous cell carcinoma cell line was treated with a control conjugate prepared by combining PEP with mouse IgG instead of B4G7, no cytotoxicity was observed. These results indicate that B4G7-PEP will be a useful weapon in multidisciplinary treatment which utilizes the EGF receptor, as these receptors are detected in a higher incidence in squamous cell carcinoma.",M2
1718218,"[Combined preoperative treatment with bilateral intra-arterial chemotherapy (CBDCA + <e>PEP</e>) and radiotherapy of oral cancer on the midline]Intra-arterial chemotherapy from bilateral superficial temporal arteries and radiotherapy were carried out preoperatively on two patients with oral cancer on the midline. Total doses of preoperative chemo- and radio-therapies were 160 mg/m2 of carboplatin, 50 mg of peplomycin and 20 Gy of 60Co-irradiation, respectively. Therapeutic effect of preoperative chemo- and radio-therapies was evaluated on the resected materials from histological point of view. In case 1, the effect was judged as Grade II A in Oboshi's classification, which indicated a mild destruction of architecture of tumor tissue and a few viable tumor cells, but an extreme reduction of the primary lesion was observed on clinical appearance. In case 2, the therapeutic effect was regarded as Grade II B, which indicated a severe destruction of architecture of tumor tissue and few viable tumor cells. Concerning toxicity, mucositis and slight thrombocytopenia (96,000/mm3) in case 1, and mucositis and leukopenia (2,300/mm3) in case 2 appeared. However, they soon recovered after termination of the preoperative therapies. From the above results, it was considered that a combination of bilateral intra-arterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy was quite effective as a preoperative treatment for oral cancers on the midline at the same doses of anti-neoplastic agents and irradiation as for the other unilateral oral cancers.",M2

Thirty milligrams of PEP emulsified in 10 ml of jelly was orally administered for 17 patients on consecutive bed time, and the average total dose was 470 mg. Concentrations of PEP in blood and tissue were measured with a bioassay. PEP was not detected in the blood but was detected in esophageal tissue and regional lymphnodes. A significant difference (p less than 0.05) of tissue concentrations between normal esophageal mucosa (0.11 microgram/g) and malignant region (0.34 microgram/g) was noted. Furthermore, PEP was detected in many regional lymphnodes. Histological antitumor effect (Ef2) was noted in three of the eight metastatic lymphnodes. A side effect of this treatment was not recognized. It is believed that this treatment is safe and useful in combination with other adjuvant cancer therapy.",M2
1714736,"Enhanced anti-cancer efficacy on lymph node metastasis using peplomycin adsorbed on small activated carbon particles.A new dosage form (<e>PEP</e>-CH) of peplomycin was tested for therapeutic efficacy against lymph node metastasis in mice. PEP-CH is a suspension comprising 4 mg/ml of activated carbon, 2 mg/ml of peplomycin and 1.6 mg/ml of polyvinylpyrrolidone in saline. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 3 x 10(5) MH134 tumor cells into the left hind paw. Drugs were given on day 10 when cancer had been metastasized in the left popliteal lymph node. Mice were killed on day 17 and the left popliteal lymph node and the left deep inguinal lymph node were extirpated. Since the degree of the metastatic lesion and the lymph node weight correlated with a statistically high probability with each other, the degree of metastatic lesion was evaluated through comparison of lymph node weight. The left popliteal lymph node and the deep inguinal lymph node were 10.5 mg and 4.5 mg in average weight, respectively, in the mice given PEP-CH containing 0.1 mg of peplomycin subcutaneously into the left hind foot-pad. The weights were significantly smaller than those in the mice given an identical dose of peplomycin aqueous solution subcutaneously into the left hind foot-pad or intraperitoneally.",M2

Three of 12 patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 5 patients achieved partial remission (PR). Hence, the overall response rate was 66.7% (8/12). Of 9 relapsed patients who had attained CR after the former chemotherapy, 3 had CR and 4 had PR. The overall response rate was 77.8% (7/9). Side effects were relatively mild, including leukopenia (less than 1,000/microliters) (33.3%) and thrombocytopenia (less than 5 X 10(4)/microliters) (8.3%). There was no severe cardiac toxicity such as heart insufficiency and severe arrythmia.

The cell kill kinetics of NK313 on rat ascites hepatoma AH66 were compared with those of PEP. NK313 induced intracellular DNA cleavage and arrested cell cycle progression at the G2 phase similarly to PEP. The cytocidal effect of NK313, however, was found to be different from that of PEP as described below: 1) The dose-survival curve for cells exposed to PEP for 1 hour was upward concave, whereas in case of NK313, the survival curve was linear. PEP was more effective to AH66 than NK313 at lower concentration, but at higher concentration, NK313 was much more effective. 2) The time-survival curve for cells treated with either NK313 or PEP was biphasic. NK313, however, did not induce temporary resistance of AH66 cells to NK313, while PEP induced resistance to PEP. 3) NK313 was effective against the cells which became temporarily resistant to PEP by the treatment of PEP. These differences suggest that NK313 might be of value to treat PEP-insensitive tumor cells.",M2
1706170,"[The examination of DNA strand breaks induced by peplomycin-using non-radioactive in situ nick translation method]In situ nick translation (ISNT) is a method to detect DNA single strand break (nick) at each cellular level. In this study, peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>)-induced DNA strand breaks and its repair were examined using non-radioactive ISNT method. Human fibroblasts were cultured with various concentrations of PEP for different durations, and then DNA strand breaks were evaluated by ISNT method. The signal intensity of DNA strand breaks of the PEP-treated fibroblasts was increased in a dose dependent manner. At the fixed concentration of PEP, it reached to a maximum level after 10 min. of culture and remained unchanged for at least 24 hours. In addition, DNA strand breaks induced by PEP was rapidly repaired in 10 min. after washing. Thus, the non-radioactive ISNT is thought to be a quick, sensitive and specific method not only to detect DNA strand breaks but also to observe its repair.",M2

A histologic and stereologic investigation was carried out to compare the pulmonary toxicity of BLM, PEP, and a combination of the two drugs in animals. A total of 180 female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: 45 animals were treated with daily i.p. injections of 4 mg/kg BLM, 45 rats received 2.5 mg/kg i.p. PEP daily, 45 animals were given i.p. injections of a combination of 2.5 mg/kg BLM and 1 mg/kg PEP, and 45 rats received 1 ml 0.9% NaCl solution. Histological examination of the lungs demonstrated varying degrees of exudative and fibrosing alveolitis in animals treated with BLM, PEP, and BLM-PEP. Stereological analysis revealed a significant thickening of the alveolar wall after 20-60 days and a significant decrease in the surface density of alveolar walls after 40-60 days in all treated groups. Both histological examination and stereological parameters indicated more pronounced inflammatory changes in the alveolar walls and a prior loss of alveolar surface after 20 and 30 days in animals receiving PEP and PEP-BLM as compared with those undergoing BLM treatment. After 40-60 days, during which time irreversible fibrotic changes prevailed, significant stereological differences between the three treated groups could not be detected. Thus, our experimental observations did not show any potentiation of the toxic pulmonary effect of BLM and PEP following their combined administration.",M2

Clinical efficacy of HPC-PEP and tissue concentration of peplomycin (PEP) were studied in 12 patients with bladder tumor. Histopathology showed transitional cell carcinoma; 2 in grade 1,8 in grade 2, and 2 in grade 3. The total volume of 30 ml HPC-PEP was prepared from a mixture of 2% HPC and 90 mg PEP in 15 ml saline, and was intravesically administered through a urethral catheter and retained for two hours. Clinical evaluation 7 days after the initial instillation demonstrated good tumor regression in 2, good response in 5, and no change in 5. The mean PEP level in tumor tissue was 0.36 microgram/gr after 7 days and 0.19 microgram/gr even after 14 days. These clinical observations and tissue levels of PEP suggest that HPC-PEP might be useful as an intravesical instillation agent for bladder tumor.",M2

The HPC-PEP was a mixture of 90 mg PEP suspended in 30 ml of 1% HPC. Both of preparations were retained in the bladder cavity over an hour after the instillation. Intravesical instillation was performed once for the patients with HPC-PEP, and 10 times repeatedly for the patients with S-PEP. A clinical evaluation was made on the basis of cytoscopic finding and cytology one week after the final instillation. According to the degree of tumor reduction, the results were classified into  disappearance ,  greater than 50% reduction,  and  no alteration or further growth  of primary tumor, which were referred respectively to  complete response (CR) ,  partial response (PR)  and  not changed (NC) . The rates of CR and response were 27 and 73% respectively for the HPC-PEP administered patients, which were significantly higher than those of 8 and 43% respectively for the patients with S-PEP. In terms of configuration and number of tumor, intravesical HPC-PEP treatment was found to be superior to intravesical S-PEP treatment. In HPC-PEP treatment, a series of untoward symptoms such as bladder irritability and leukopenia was encountered at a frequency of 8%, which is much less than those seen in the S-PEP treatment. These clinical date suggest that HPC-PEP treatment against the superficial bladder tumors is superior to conventional S-PEP instillation in terms of administration frequency and potent doses available to tumor reduction.",M2

The cases were examined at the cooperating institutions from September 1986 to March 1988. The subjects were 93 cases consisting of 66 patients (intravenous infusion: 47 cases; intraarterial infusion: 19 cases) of PP therapy (CDDP + <e>PEP</e>), 16 cases of PF therapy (CDDP + 5-FU) and 11 cases of PPV therapy (CDDP + PEP + VCR). The regimens of PP therapy were: CDDP 50-100 mg/body x 1 day, PEP 5 mg/body x 5 days (i.v.), and CDDP 10-20 mg/body x 5 days, PEP 5-10 mg/body x 5 days (i.a.). In the regimen of PF therapy, CDDP 80-100 mg/body x 1 day and 5-FU 750-1,000 mg/body x 5 days were administered. In the regimen of PPV therapy, CDDP 80-100 mg/body x 1 day, PEP 5 mg/body x 5 days and VCR 1 mg/body x 1 day were administered. As a rule, two courses of each of the regimens were performed. The total dose of CDDP in intraarterial infusion of PP therapy was significantly less than in intravenous infusion. The major results were as follows: 1) Total response rate was 57.0% on the average, and this was not significantly different among the regimens. 2) The response rate of intraarterial infusion of PP therapy was as high as that for intravenous infusion in spite of the lower CDDP dose. 3) The response rate of oral cavity was significantly higher than that of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. 4) In the squamous cell carcinoma, the response rate of the well differentiated type was significantly higher than that of the poorly differentiated type. 5) The leukocyte counts significantly decreased with the intravenous infusion of PP therapy, PF therapy and PPV therapy. 6) The platelet counts significantly decreased with PPV therapy. 7) There were no significant changes with time with Ccr and PaO2 of PP therapy. 8) The frequency of toxicities such as nausea and vomiting was high in the intravenous infusion of PP therapy, PF therapy and PPV therapy. However, the frequency of toxicity was low in the intraarterial infusion of PP therapy.",M2
1703253,"[Clinical study of penile cancer]Recent progress in molecular biology suggests a certain relationship between penile cancer and human papilloma virus infection. However, the treatment for penile cancer has not been established since each institute has experienced only a small number of patients. We analyzed the result of our treatment for 14 penile cancer patients during past twenty years. Ten of the 14 patients were initially treated for the primary lesion with a combination of peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>) or bleomycin (BLM) and radiation therapy. Of these, 9 were found not to have residual viable cancer cells in their primary lesions. No local recurrence was found in all 7 patients in whom the penis was preserved. This result suggests that combination of PEP (BLM) and radiation preserves the penis without increasing the risk of local recurrence. Penile cancer-related death did not occur in patients without lymph node metastasis. However, this cancer death did occur in 4 out of 7 patients with lymph node metastasis, suggesting that metastasis is one of the important prognostic factors. PEP (BLM) and radiation therapy with or without regional lymph node dissection did not improve the prognosis of patients with advanced penile carcinoma, such as with pN2, pN3 or distant metastasis. More effective management may be necessary for these patients.",M2

Twenty of these 26 patients did not undergo resection of the primary sites during initial hospitalization. Radicality of the PEP chemoradiation therapy was assessed after a long-term follow-up. Patients of Stage I to IV numbered 4, 7, 1 and 8, respectively. Total dosage was 60 Gy of Linac irradiation under 80-110 mg infusion of PEP.

In 11 cases of advanced cancer of the uterine cervix, serum and urinary levels of alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-m) and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m), and urinary albumin (Alb) and lysozyme (LZM) were determined before the chemotherapy and 1,2 and 3 weeks after the therapy. Results are summarized as follows: 1. After intra-arterial chemotherapy, the histological classification was Grade I in 1 case (9.1%), Grade IIa in 2 cases (18.2%), and Grade IIb in 8 cases (72.7%). 2. Serum alpha 1-m and beta 2-m levels remained within the normal range after chemotherapy. 3.

This patient was treated with four courses of combination chemotherapy including VPCP (a combination of VCR, <e>PEP</e>, CDDP and PEP) regimen as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. And radiotherapy was given as a secondary treatment; Linac. 60 Gy/6 weeks. He showed no tumor masses in the hypopharynx following this combination chemotherapy. No recurrence has been found under endoscopy for one year after the treatment with combination chemotherapy. It thus seems that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery and/or radiation including cisplatin, peplomycin and other agents is very useful as a multimodal treatment for cancer of the hypopharynx.",M2

Concomitant angiotensin II (AT II) administered by intravenous drip infusion was double the tumoral blood flow and thereby enhanced the efficiency of the intra-arterial chemotherapeutic regimen. But CDDP runs the risk of renal and myelotoxicity, so we studied renal dysfunction after treatment by examining serum and urinary beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m), and RBC, Hb, WBC, lymphocyte, and PLT. Results: At 1 week after the treatment, evaluation of the histological effects showed, Grade IIb: 72.7% (8/11 cases). Serum beta 2-m was within normal limit and not changed. Urinary beta 2-m levels increased to abnormal levels at 1 and 2 weeks after treatment, and fell to normal levels at 3 weeks after treatment. RBC, Hb, WBC, lymphocyte, and PLT fell most at 3 weeks after treatment and then increased slowly. This suggests that hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy (CDDP) impaired kidney and bone marrow, mildly and reversibly, and its appropriate interval is about 4 weeks.",M2

Among them, 70 patients were diagnosed superficial bladder tumor. Of these 70 cases, 30 were treated with intravesical adriamycin (ADR) and peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), 13 with ADR only and one case with PEP and remaining 26 with TUR and hydrostatic pressure technique. We studied the efficacy of combination intravesical chemotherapy with ADR and PEP and other treatments in the prevention of recurrence in the superficial bladder tumor cases. The recurrence rate during 3 years of each group, was 25% in the group treated with ADR and PEP, 35% with ADR and 55% in remaining group. 3 years recurrence rate in the group treated with ADR and PEP was significantly low than that in the group tread with TUR and hydrostatic pressure technique alone (Wilcoxon test). Side effects was pollakisuria, pain after micturition and others. Anaphylactic shock appeared in one case. From these results we concluded that intravesical chemotherapy with combined agents is more effective than that with a single one or no treatment after TUR.",M2
2473972,"Tumor cell permeability to peplomycin.The uptake of [3H]peplomycin-Cu(II) ([3H]<e>PEP</e>-Cu(II)) into various tumor cell lines was studied. The time course of [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake into AH66, AH66F, Ehrlich and P388 cells was biphasic. The first phase of uptake was completed within 5 minutes. The second, slower phase, of uptake into AH66, AH66F and Ehrlich cells increased linearly with incubation time, but that into P388 cells reached a plateau level. In L1210 cells, only the first rapid uptake was observed. The lower uptake into P388 and L1210 cells during the second phase may be related to their insensitivity to PEP. However, the uptake into AH66F cells was higher than that into AH66 cells, although AH66F cells were less sensitive to PEP than AH66 cells. Deamide PEP was detected in intact cells which had taken up [3H]PEP-Cu(II) during 4 hours. This confirmed that PEP-Cu(II) was transported into the cell, the copper removed and PEP metabolized to deamide PEP. [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake into AH66 and AH66F cells increased in proportion to the extracellular concentration of drug up to at least 200 micrograms/ml, suggesting that uptake was not mediated by a carrier system. Metabolic inhibitors such as NaN3 and 2,4-dinitrophenol enhanced [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake, but did not influence efflux. Uptake was also enhanced by membrane modifiers such as dibucaine and chlorpromazine which increase the fluidity of lipid membranes. The results suggest that PEP-Cu(II) was taken up into tumor cells by passive diffusion, controlled by an energy-dependent cell membrane barrier.",M2
2476525,"[Effects of anti-platelet aggregating agents on peplomycin induced pulmonary toxicity in mice]In order to find a method to ameliorate pulmonary toxicity of peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), microscopic changes of the lung following PEP administration and effect of anti-platelet aggregating agents on the toxicity was investigated in mice. When PEP was administered intravenously once a day for 7 days, microthrombi mainly composed of aggregated platelets and fibrin appeared in the capillaries of the lung in an early phase before severe pulmonary edematous lesions and fibrosis occurred. Combination therapy of anti-platelet aggregating agents such as phthalazinol, dipyridamole, ticlopidine and indomethacin suppressed these toxic changes. Especially, ticlopidine was the most effective and superior to prednisolone used clinically for amelioration of the toxicity. Microthrombi, preceding edematous lesions, were considered to be attributed to damages of endothelium by PEP, because PEP itself did not develop platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. Therefore, the microthrombi are likely to produce congestion of pulmonary microcirculation leading to edematous lesions by increase of permeability, and to play significant roles in the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a late phase. Anti-platelet aggregating agents such as ticlopidine are concluded to ameliorate the lung toxicity by preventing microcirculation impairment with the microthrombus.",M2

Activated carbon particles have affinity to the regional lymph-nodes and the tumor surface. When activated carbon particles adsorbing anticancer drug were administered into the tissues or serosal cavity, they remained for a long time at the site of application, and released the drug slowly. Activated carbon particles adsorbing mitomycin C (MMC-CH) were prepared for the use of an intracavitary administration. In animal experiment tissues, MMC-CH distributed a large amount of mitomycin C to the intraperitoneal tissues, while there was a low level of mitomycin C in the whole body. The LD50 value of MMC-CH was 5.3 times as high as that of mitomycin C aqueous solution. The therapeutic index (LD50/ED50) of the MMC-CH therapy was 3.1 times higher than that of the mitomycin C aqueous solution in Yoshida sarcoma ascites. Clinical trials of MMC-CH were performed in 81 patients with malignant effusion. Fifty-one of the 81 patients responded well.

In study I, 22 patients with low stage bladder cancer were entered, and 16 of them were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Twelve patients were treated twice a week with intravesical instillation of 20 mg of PEP/20 ml of saline for 4 weeks. Four patients were treated in the same way with 40 mg of PEP/20 ml of saline. Among the patients treated with 20 mg of PEP, two showed complete remission and one showed partial remission. Of the patients treated with 40 mg of PEP, one showed partial remission. Thus, the overall response rate was 25%. The tumors of the two complete responders were so tiny that they might have been damaged mechanically by the biopsy forceps. Therefore, we considered that the instillation chemotherapy of PEP at a dose of 20 or 40 mg/20 ml of saline had little effect on superficial bladder cancer. In study II, we performed a randomized trial designed to compare the recurrence rate after transurethral resection (TUR) alone with that after TUR followed by prophylactic instillation of PEP.

Although PEP was more effective than BLM against BLM-resistant HeLa cells (HeLa-BLMr), neoplastic cells derived from salivary gland (HSG) and melanoma cells (MEC), these three cell lines were still at least ten times more resistant to PEP than epidermoid carcinoma cell lines including HeLa cells by comparison of IC50, and showed lower cellular accumulation of 3H-PEP as compared with HeLa cells.

The response rates of evaluable cases (EC) were as follows: Squamous cell carcinoma; Regimen PMP 50% (1 CR + 4 PR/10 EC). Regimen PM 40% (4 PR/10 EC). Adenocarcinoma plus large cell carcinoma; Regimen PMF 13.6% (3 PR/22 EC). Regimen PM 11.1% (2 PR/18 EC). The median survival time (MST) was increased from 23 weeks in non-responders to 32 weeks in responders. However, the difference between the survival curves for responders and non-responders was not statistically significant. Of the toxic effects shown in all 74 registered pts, hematological (64.9%), gastrointestinal (60.8%) and renal (31.1%) toxicities were the common complications. We concluded that regimen PMP was more useful than regimen PM for pts with squamous cell carcinoma but that regimen PMF demonstrated no appreciable difference, compared with regimen PM for pts with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.",M2
2430876,"[The relationship between morphological manifestations and cell kinetic changes of human lung cancer cells after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents]The relationship between morphological manifestations and cell kinetic changes of three lung cancer cell lines after exposure with chemotherapeutic agents was studied. After treatment with Cis-dichloro diammine platinum (II) (CDDP), an increase in cells of G2/M compartment at first, and then of S compartment was observed. As for the morphological manifestation, enlarged nuclear cells were more frequently observed. These cells seemed to be in S-G2/M compartment and to die finally. However a part of cells escaped from complete blockade may show multiple nuclei. Also after treatment with Etoposide (VP-16), an increase of G2/M compartment was observed, and on the morphological manifestation enlarged nuclear cells or double-or multiple-nuclear cells were observed. As these cells seemed to enter into G2/M compartment immediately. Cell destruction was thought to be started earlier compared with other two drugs. After treatment with Peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), its effects on cell cycle traverse were only minimum accumulation of G2/M compartment in high PEP concentration. However concerning the morphological manifestation, many cells treated with PEP revealed enlarged, double or multiple nuclei. This suggests that morphological manifestation may reflect cytocydal effects more dominantly than cell cycle traverse. Each chemotherapeutic agent influenced the morphological manifestation and the cell kinetics of human lung cancer cells characteristically. It seemed to be important to study these relations in order to estimate the effect of chemotherapeutic agents and the therapeutic efficacy on cancer cells.",M2
2427033,"[Successful chemotherapy in undescended testicular and extragonadal germ cell tumors: report of 2 cases]Two patients with advanced germ cell tumor who entered complete remission following intensive combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgical intervention are reported. A 28-year-old businessman presented with abdominal pain and masses associated with an elevated HCG level for which he underwent exploratory laparotomy. Large retroperitoneal masses were found and microscopical examination of the masses were revealed seminoma. Three courses of combination chemotherapy consisting of CDDP, VLB and <e>PEP</e> were given to the patient followed by radiation therapy to the parailiac, paraaortic, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes with boost irradiation to the paraaortic lymph nodes where the large masses were located. The other patient was a 21-year-old student who developed sharp precordial chest pain which proved to be due to a large mediastinal mass accompanied by an elevated AFP level. He was treated with radiation therapy to the mediastinum, surgical resection and combination chemotherapy. However, he showed recurrence in the lungs associated with rising AFP levels, and was given a salvage chemotherapy consisting of 3 courses of CDDP, ADR, PEP and Etoposide. Both patients were successfully treated with combined modalities of treatment including intensive chemotherapy and have been off therapy without recurrence for over 12 and 4 months, respectively.",M2
2425748,"[Use of arterial infusion of neocarzinostatin with or without combination chemotherapy as a treatment of carcinoma of the prostate]Prostate cancer patients were treated with a basic therapy of intra-arterial injection of neocarzinostatin (NCS). This therapy was divided into three types of regimen: NCS intra-arterial injection alone, NCS intra-arterial injection + diethylstilbestrol (DES), and NCS intra-arterial injection + aclacinomycin A (ACR) + peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>). A comparative study was carried out on the clinical efficacies of these three regimens, and at the same time an investigation was made of the prognosis in the cases receiving NCS intra-arterial injection alone and NCS + DES. The clinical efficacy was found to be high in each of the three treatment groups in terms of subjective symptoms and laboratory findings, except for ALP. In the evaluation of efficacy on the basis of histological findings, the rates were 60.0% for NCS intra-arterial injection alone, 71.4% for NCS + DES, and 88.2% for NCS + ACR + PEP. Thus, all three of these treatment regimens gave good efficacy rates, but it is especially noteworthy that the combined chemotherapy regimen yielded the highest efficacy rate. On the other hand, the incidence of adverse reactions was much higher in the case of the combined chemotherapy regimen than in the other two regimens. In the patient group administered the NCS intra-arterial injection alone, the one-year survival rate was 75.0% and the 4-year survival rate was 25.0%, while in the NCS + DES treatment group the one-year survival rate was 87.5% and the 4-year survival rate was 37.5%. For individual patients, the correlation between the clinical efficacy and the prognosis was not strong. However, it was concluded that all three of the chemotherapy regimens are useful as forms of remission induction therapy.",M2
2439061,"Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and peplomycin in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.Ninety-three patients with head and neck cancer were treated with combined cisplatin-peplomycin chemotherapy (CP therapy). Cisplatin (CDDP) 50 mg/m2 i.v. (intravenous) or i.a. (intraarterial) over 2 hr was given with hydration and mannitol diuresis on day 1. From day 2 through day 6, peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>) 5 mg/day was administered by 5-hr i.v. or i.a. infusion, or 24-hr continuous hypodermic injection. Of 85 who were evaluable, there were 22 complete responses or CR (26%) and 36 partial responses or PR (42%), with an overall response rate of 68%. Concerning of the route of administration, i.a. infusion obtained the higher CR and overall response rates than i.v. infusion. Effectiveness was clearly greater in previously untreated cases than in cases that had received some previous therapeutic modality. Looking at response in relation to the number of the courses, at least 2 courses of CP therapy are required. Side effects were recognized in 68 out of 87 evaluable cases (78%). Nausea and vomiting were the most common (62%). Renal toxicity was observed in 24% and was mostly transient. From the above results, it is considered that the CP therapy is effective, not only for the palliative treatment of advanced and recurrent cancer of the head and neck, but also as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of stage III and IV cases.",M2
2429646,"Combination chemotherapy with CDDP, 5-FU and <e>PEP</e> in head and neck malignant tumors.Multi-drug combination therapy with CDDP, 5-FU and PEP was performed in 23 patients with malignant tumors in the head and neck region, and 2 CR patients and 9 PR patients were obtained with a response rate of 47.8%. The present therapy (CFP therapy) is considered to be especially effective against patients at low performance status grades with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which is located in regions receiving an abundant blood supply like the oral cavity. It is advisable to perform more than 2 courses of treatment as an induction chemotherapy. With respect to the method of administration of PEP, further study will be made in the future.",M2
2415720,"[Combination chemotherapy with peplomycin, cis-platinum and mitomycin C in gynecologic cancer]Eight patients with gynecologic cancer (cervix: 6, corpus: 1 and vulva: 1) were treated with combination chemotherapy, PPM therapy consisting of continuously infused <e>PEP</e> 4mg/m2 days 1-5, CDDP 13 mg/m2 days 1-5, and MMC 3mg/m2 day 1. This was repeated every three to five weeks. Six of the eight patients were evaluable, two had a complete response and one had a partial response, for an overall response rate of 50%. Because of hematological toxicity, blood transfusion was carried out in four patients. Nephrotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity were slight. Nausea and vomiting were controlled with dexamethasone and domperidone. PPM therapy is considered to be an effective and useful combination chemotherapy for patients with gynecologic cancer.",M2
2409926,"[A neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for carcinomas of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus]Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by definitive surgery and/or radiotherapy was utilized in nine patients with carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus starting in December, 1983. They were treated with combination chemotherapies which included CDDP, <e>PEP</e> (BLM), and MTX. The patients' ages ranged from 52 to 70 years with an average of 57. The histologic types were all squamous cell carcinoma and performance status was 1 in all cases. There were 7 stage III and 2 stage IV. Of 9 patients, 3 showed complete response and 6 showed partial response of the primary tumor with an overall response rate of 100%. Of 8 patients, 3 showed complete response and 2 showed partial response of the metastatic node with an overall response rate of 62.5%. Toxic effects included alopecia in 9 patients, nausea/vomiting in 7, eczema in 4, RBC below 350 X 10(4)/mm3 in 5, WBC below 3000/mm3 in 1, peak serum creatinine above 2 mg/dl in 1. All patients except one with renal toxicity were able to start definitive treatment soon after chemotherapy, the primary and regional lesions being subsequently well controlled in all 9 patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be very effective for the reduction of tumor bulk. This multidisciplinary therapy should be expected to increase survival rate.",M2

There were 8 males and 9 females with a median age of 64 yrs (range 3-74 yrs) and a median PS 3 (range 2-4). Three of these were children. At first PEP was given intermittently and intramuscularly (8 cases) at a dose of 10 mg every one (3 cases) or two (5 cases) weeks, and then intravenously by 22-hr continuous infusion (9 cases) at a dose of 5 mg per day for 5 days. Mean cumulative dose was 78 mg. Objective responses were obtained in 6 patient (35%). CR lasting 4 weeks was obtained in one patient with diffuse mixed-type lymphoma. Five patients, one with diffuse medium-sized cell type and 3 with diffuse large cell type, had PR, lasting 6, 7, 7, 9, and 50+ weeks, respectively. Pulmonary fibrosis was found in two patients on autopsy and interstitial pneumonia in two patients clinically. Temporary high fever occurred in 7 patients, stomatitis in 3 patients and anorexia in 3 patients.",M2
2580923,"[Experimental studies on combination chemotherapy based on cell cycle analysis]Based on Peplomycin-induced cell cycle distribution analyzed by a flow-cytemetry using HeLa S-3 and SNG-M cells in vitro, we investigated reasonable periods and kinds of drug combined with pepleomycin (<e>PEP</e>). Changes in both the PEP treatment time and dosage produced a redistribution which decreases the number of cells in the G1 phase and increased the number of cells in the S and G2-M phases. The period with the maximum number of cells in the S phase was 12 hours in the HeLa S-3 and 16 hours in the SNG-M and, that in the G2-M phases, 16 hours in the HeLa S-3 and 22 hours in the SNG-M after the treatment. In the combination of the pep with CIS-DDP 4-hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide Adriamycin (ADR) and ACNU, the cytotoxic potency of the four drugs were CIS-DDP greater than 4-Hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide greater than ADR greater than ACNU in the HeLa S-3 and 4-Hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide greater than CIS-DDP greater than ADR greater than ACNU in the SNG-M. This suggests that the Cis and 4-Hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide were adequate for the combination with the PEP. The period of the combination should be at the time of the greatest accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase, because the pep effectively produced the G2-M partial synchronization. These results suggest that the combination chemotherapy should be based on the analysis of the cell cycle.",M2

Tumor regression rate determined by chest X-ray film 2 or 3 weeks after BAI was highest in the PEP (iv).MMC group followed by the PEP + MMC and MMC group. Cavity formation was more typical in the group treated with PEP + MMC. Histopathological effects were best for the PEP + MMC group followed by those of the PEP (iv).MMC and MMC group. As for side effects, pulmonary fibrosis and necrotizing bronchitis were noted in 8% of the PEP + MMC group, but side effects in the other two groups were mild. In conclusion single use of MMC after intravenous PEP administration was found to be the best way to give BAI in these three groups.",M2
2415503,"Mechanisms affecting peplomycin sensitivity of Chinese hamster cell lines.Chinese hamster lung cell line V79 was ca. 13 times more resistant to peplomycin (<e>PEP</e>), and 6 times more resistant to bleomycin (BLM)-A2 than Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The natural resistance of V79 cells to PEP or BLM was attributed to higher levels of BLM hydrolase activity and lower cellular uptake of the antibiotic. The sensitivity to PEP of a mutant clone CHO/O-2 T-1 was similar to that of CHO. A hybrid clone of CHO/O-2 T-1 X V79 showed an intermediate sensitivity to PEP between those of both parental cell lines, suggesting that the gene responsible for the natural resistance to PEP appears codominantly in the hybrid. The BLM hydrolase activity of the hybrid was also found intermediate between those of both parental cells. Mutant clones CHO/O-2 T-5 and CHO/O-2 T-6 were 8.3-9.0 times more sensitive to PEP than CHO cells. Hybrid clones CHO/O-2 T-5 X V79 and CHO/O-2 T-6 X V79 displayed PEP sensitivity similar to that of V79, suggesting that the gene responsible for the PEP supersensitivity (PEPss) behaves recessively in the hybrids. Both PEPss clones showed levels of BLM hydrolase and cellular uptake of [3H]PEP similar to the parental CHO cells, suggesting that the PEPss is due to neither BLM hydrolase nor cellular uptake of the antibiotic. Increased PEP-induced DNA cleavage and decreased DNA repair in the PEPss clones were demonstrated by alkaline sucrose density gradient sedimentation method. The results suggest that the PEPss of these mutant clones is attributed to decreased DNA-repairing activity and/or increased DNA-breaking activity.",M2
