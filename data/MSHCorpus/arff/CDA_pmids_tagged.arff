19890907,"Cytoreductive therapy in 108 adults with systemic mastocytosis: Outcome analysis and response prediction during treatment with interferon-alpha, hydroxyurea, imatinib mesylate or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine.Cytoreductive therapy in systemic mastocytosis (SM) includes several drugs whose individual merit has not been well characterized. We retrospectively studied 108 Mayo Clinic patients who met the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for SM and received at least one cytoreductive drug. The numbers of patients who were evaluable for response to treatment with interferon-alpha with or without prednisone (IFN-alpha), hydroxyurea (HU), imatinib mesylate (IM) or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) were 40, 26, 22, and 22, respectively. The corresponding overall (major) response rates, according to recently published consensus criteria, were 53% (18%), 19% (0%), 18% (9%), and 55% (37%). The respective overall response rates in indolent SM, aggressive SM and SM associated with another clonal hematological nonmast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) were 60%, 60%, 45% for IFN-alpha, 0, 0, 21% for HU, 14%, 50%, 9% for IM and 56%, 50%, 55% for 2-CdA. The absence of mast cell mediator release symptoms in IFN-alpha-treated patients and presence of circulating immature myeloid cells in 2-CdA-treated patients predicted inferior response. TET2 mutational status did not influence treatment response. Although the major response rates with these four cytoreductive agents were still suboptimal and HU was mainly used in patients with SM-AHNMD, the current study favors 2-CdA or IFN-alpha as first-line current therapy in SM and identifies patients who are likely to respond to such therapy.",M1
19764992,"Impaired up-regulation of polo-like kinase 2 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia lymphocytes resistant to fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine: a potential marker of defective damage response.The functional evaluation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53 was recently developed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), a disease in which the response to DNA damage is frequently altered. We identified a novel biomarker of chemosensitivity based on the induction of DNA damage by the purine nucleoside analogues (PNA) fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>). Using genome-wide expression profiling, it was observed that, in chemosensitive samples, PNA predominantly increased the expression of p53-dependent genes, among which PLK2 was the most highly activated at early time points. Conversely, in chemoresistant samples, p53-dependent and PLK2 responses were abolished. Using a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, we confirmed that PNA dose- and time-dependently increased PLK2 expression in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant B-CLL samples. Analysis of a larger cohort of B-CLL patients showed that cytotoxicity induced by PNA correlated well with PLK2 mRNA induction. Interestingly, we observed that failure to up-regulate PLK2 following PNA and chemoresistance were not strictly correlated with structural alterations in the TP53 gene. In conclusion, we propose that testing PLK2 activation after a 24-h incubation with PNA could be used to investigate the functional integrity of DNA damage-response pathways in B-CLL cells, and predict clinical sensitivity to these drugs.",M1
19647871,"Expression of the human concentrative nucleotide transporter 1 (hCNT1) gene correlates with clinical response in patients affected by Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) undergoing a combination treatment with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and Rituximab.PURPOSE: Resistance to nucleoside analogues agents is likely to be multifactorial and could involve a number of mechanisms affecting drug penetration, metabolism and targeting. In vitro studies of resistant human cell lines have confirmed that human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1)-deficient cells display resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We applied real-time PCR method to assess the mRNA expression of equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1, hCNT1), deoxycytidine and deoxyguanosine kinase (dCK, dGK), 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), ribonucleotide reductase catalytic and regulatory (RR1, RR2) subunits in bone marrow cells from 32 patients with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who received 2CdA-based chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy, were then correlated to the expression of these markers. RESULTS: All 32 patients enrolled expressed lower levels of hCNT1 as compared to healthy donors. In univariate analysis, lower expression level of hCNT1 (p=0.0021) and RR2 (p=0.02) correlated with response to chemotherapy. In particular, patients with low levels of hCNT1 achieved inferior clinical response. No significant correlation between these genes expression and age, stage of disease was found. This study suggests that nucleotidase expression levels can be used to identify subgroups of WM and SLL patients who will likely respond differently to a 2CdA-based therapy.",M1
19125089,"Treatment of refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) with a combination of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and cytosine arabinoside.The combination of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CDA</e>) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) has been shown to be effective in children with refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). We have treated 5 patients with recurrent LCH with 2-CDA/Ara-C chemotherapy and closely followed immune and hematopoietic function. These patients display a decline in the absolute CD4, CD8, and natural killer cell number, decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio. Septic events, including pneumocystis infection were present after most of the treatment courses (15/21). These data suggest that 2-CDA /Ara-C, should be considered in resistant and relapsed pediatric patients with LCH with high-risk multiorgan involvement. Consequent profound prolonged combined immune deficiency and myelosupression should be anticipated.",M1
19025975,"Activity of cladribine combined with cyclophosphamide in frontline therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 17p13.1/TP53 deletion: report from the Polish Adult Leukemia Group.BACKGROUND: The 17p13.1 deletion that causes loss of the p53-encoding TP53 gene is the most powerful predictor of a poor response to conventional therapy and shortened survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The results of this study have demonstrated that the cladribine and cyclophosphamide regimen may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population. METHODS: In this study, the authors retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of 2-<e>CdA</e> with cyclophosphamide combination (the CC regimen) in 20 patients with previously untreated B-cell CLL who had 17p13.1 deletion reported to the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) registry. The CC regimen consisted of 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m2 given intravenously for 3 consecutive days. The CC cycles were repeated at 28-day intervals for up to 6 cycles. RESULTS: Overall, 16 of 20 patients (80%) responded to CC therapy, including 10 patients (50%) who obtained a complete response and 6 patients (30%) who obtained a partial response. The median progression-free survival reached 23 months (95% confidence interval, 5-41 months). The overall survival probability at 2 years was 52.5% (95% confidence interval, 26%-79%). Treatment toxicity generally was acceptable. Infections were the most common grade 3/4 complications and occurred in 6 patients (30%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, the results demonstrated that the CC regimen produced a relatively high response rate in patients with previously untreated CLL who had 17p13.1/TP53 deletion, although the response duration and survival were not satisfactory. It is possible that a combination of the CC regimen with p53-independent agents may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population.",M1
18497995,"2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-induced apoptosis in T leukemia cells is mediated via a caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial feedback amplification loop.2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>; cladribine) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of certain leukemias. However, the signalling events that govern CdA-mediated cytotoxicity in leukemia cells remain unclear. We show here that CdA treatment caused Jurkat human T leukemia cells to die via apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Bcl-2 overexpression protected Jurkat T leukemia cells from CdA-induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m). Furthermore, mitochondria that were isolated from Jurkat T leukemia cells and then exposed to CdA showed a loss of Delta Psi m, indicating that CdA directly compromised outer mitochondrial membrane integrity. CdA treatment of Jurkat T leukemia cells resulted in the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, while inhibition of these caspases prevented the CdA-induced loss of Delta Psi m, as well as DNA fragmentation. In addition, caspase-3 inhibition prevented caspase-8 activation while caspase-8 inhibition prevented caspase-9 activation. Death receptor signalling was not involved in CdA-induced apoptosis since cytotoxicity was not affected by FADD-deficiency or antibody neutralization of either Fas ligand or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Taken together, these data suggested that CdA-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells was mediated via a caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial feedback amplification loop. CdA treatment also increased p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Although ERK1/2 inhibition did not affect CdA-mediated cytotoxicity, inhibition of p38 MAPK had an enhancing effect, which suggested a cytoprotective function for p38 MAPK. Agents that inhibit p38 MAPK might therefore increase the effectiveness of CdA-based chemotherapy.",M1
18470909,"Long-term results of the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma with cladribine (2-<e>CDA</e>) alone (95-80-53) or 2-CDA and rituximab (N0189) in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test cladribine (2-CDA) alone and in combination with rituximab in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). METHODS: Patients with MCL were treated on 2 sequential trials. In Trial 95-80-53, patients received 2-CDA as initial therapy or at relapse. In Trial N0189, patients received combination 2-CDA and rituximab as initial therapy. In both trials, 2-CDA was administered at a dose of 5 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 through 5 every 4 weeks for 2 to 6 cycles, depending on response. In Trial N0189, rituximab 375 mg/m2 was administered on Day 1 of each cycle. RESULTS: Results were reported for 80 patients. Twenty-six previously untreated patients and 25 patients who had recurrent disease with a median age of 68 years received single-agent 2-CDA. The overall response rate (ORR) was 81% with 42% complete responses (CRs) in the previously untreated group. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.6 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 7.2-22.1 months), and 81% of patients remained alive at 2 years. The ORR was 46% with a 21% CR rate in the recurrent disease group. The median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-13.1 months), and 36% of patients remained alive at 2 years. Twenty-nine eligible patients with a median age of 70 years received 2-CDA plus rituximab. The ORR was 66% (19 of 29 patient), and the CR rate was 52% (15 of 29 patients). The median duration of response for patients who achieved a CR had not been reached at the time of the current report, and only 3 of the patients who achieved a CR developed recurrent disease at a median follow-up of 21.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: 2-CDA had substantial single-agent activity in both recurrent and untreated MCL, and the results indicated that it may be administered safely to elderly patients. The addition of rituximab to 2-CDA may increase the duration of response.",M1
18393777,"Recent clinical trials of cladribine in hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders.The purine nucleoside analog - cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-<e>CdA</e>) is a cytotoxic agent with high activity in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. It is also an effective drug in some autoimmune disorders. 2-CdA is usually administered intravenously in continuous or 2-hour infusion. Recently however, new formulation of this agent has been developed for subcutaneous and oral administration. 2-CdA is widely established as first line standard treatment for hairy cell leukemia. Moreover several clinical trials have demonstrated that this agent, used alone or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, showed good efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, some studies indicate that 2-CdA has some activity in progressive multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and in patients with refractory factor VIII inhibitors. This review article will summarize the results of recent clinical trials with 2-CdA in hematological malignancies, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.",M1
18322355,"Activity and toxicity of 2-<e>CDA</e> in Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a single institutional experience.BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature and abnormal bone marrow derived langerhans cells. Treatment is usually multimodal. Potent anti-monocyte as well as immunomodulatory activity of 2-CDA and its proven efficacy in many lymphoproliferative disorders has made 2-CDA a rational choice in treatment of LCH. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of 2-CDA in children with relapsed or refractory LCH. SETTING AND DESIGN: This is a pilot study and we present the initial data of the first seven patients treated at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients of relapsed and refractory LCH were enrolled from July 2000 to June 2004. The cohort of seven patients included six males and one female with a median age at initiation of cladribine was 2.25 years (range, 1.67 to 7.0 years). Three patients had received one prior chemotherapy regimen while the rest were heavily pretreated. Cladribine was administered over two hours IV daily for five days and repeated every four weeks. RESULTS: After a median of six courses of cladribine (range, 2 to 9), two (33%) patients achieved PR and two (33%) patients have SD on imaging but are clinically better. None experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity. At a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 8 to 52 months), five patients remain alive and one patient has died. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that single agent 2-CDA is active and well-tolerated in children with relapsed or refractory LCH.",M1
18221024,"Older and new formulations of cladribine. Pharmacology and clinical efficacy in hematological malignancies.The purine nucleoside analog (PNA)--cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is a cytotoxic agent of high efficacy in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. This drug was approved by the FDA for treatment of hairy cell leukemia and in some European countries for treatment of refractory/relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 2-CdA is usually administered as continuous or intermittent intravenous infusion. Recently however, new formulations of this agent has been developed for subcutaneous and oral administration. In contrast to other PNA, 2-CdA is equally cytotoxic to both proliferating and quiescent cells and several pathways may be responsible for the mechanism of its action. In addition, recent data indicate that 2-CdA combined with other cytotoxic agents and monoclonal antibodies show synergistic proapoptotic and cytotoxic activity on lymphoid and myeloid neoplastic cells. This review article summarizes recent achievements in the understanding of 2-CdA mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics of different pharmaceutical formulations and its approved and possible future applications in the treatment of hematological malignancies. The most important recent patents concerning oral formulations of 2-CdA have been presented.",M1
18214689,"The epigenetics of mantle cell lymphoma.There is no consensus treatment for newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. The CHOP + rituximab and hyperCVAD + rituximab regimens are most commonly used. The former is limited by relatively lower rates of complete remission (CR) and frequent relapses. The latter is limited by toxicities, especially in older patients, and relapses that occur later than those usually seen with CHOP + rituximab. Thus, improved therapies are needed. The purine analog cladribine (2-<e>cda</e>) + rituximab has been studied as an alternative frontline regimen in MCL and is quite active with minimal toxicity. Cladribine has epigenetic activity in that it inhibits DNA methylation. Cladribine + rituximab should be further studied in newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma in combination with new agents such as inhibitors of histone deacetylation, the mTOR pathway, and the proteasome.",M1
19326772,"Pharmacokinetics of cladribine in a rat model following subcutaneous and intra-arterial injections.Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6-8 per group) weighing from 300-450 g were used for the study. Each rat received a single dose of cladribine (<e>CdA</e>) by ia (1 mg/kg) or s.c. (2 mg/kg) injection. Pharmacokinetic data were calculated by standard procedures assuming a 2-compartment open model following i.v. bolus using WinNonLin and Rstrips, and differences between the two modes of injections were considered significance when p &lt; 0.05. The results showed that plasma concentrations of CdA decreased rapidly following a biphasic decline after both ia and s.c. administrations. The AUC and t1/2 beta after a single 1 mg/kg ia and 2 mg/kg s.c. injection of CdA were 0.66 +/- 0.34 vs 1.2 +/- 0.3 microg x h/ml and 3.5 +/- 2.1 vs 4.5 +/- 2.2 h, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). The mean absolute bioavailability following the s.c. injection was close to 90%. The inter-subject variability of plasma concentrations of CdA was 35% and 150% following sc and ia injections, respectively. It is concluded that the rat is a reasonably good animal model to study the pharmacokinetics of CdA in plasma, and that sc injection may produce more favourable pharmacokinetic profiles than ia injection following a single dose.",M1
18076637,"Cladribine combined with high doses of arabinoside cytosine, mitoxantrone, and G-CSF (CLAG-M) is a highly effective salvage regimen in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia of the poor risk: a final report of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group.OBJECTIVES: Patients with primary refractory AML and with early relapses have unfavorable prognoses and require innovative therapeutic approaches. Purine analogs fludarabine (FA) and cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) increase cytotoxic effect of Ara-C in leukemic blasts and inhibit DNA repair mechanisms; therefore its association with Ara-C and mitoxantrone (MIT) results in a synergistic effect. In the current report, we present the final results of multi-center phase II study evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of CLAG-M salvage regimen in poor risk refractory/relapsed AML patients. METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C 2 g/m2, MIT 10 mg/m2, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. In the case of PR, a second CLAG-M was administered. Patients in CR received consolidation courses based on high doses of Ara-C and MIT with or without 2-CdA. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen patients from 11 centers were registered; 78 primary resistant and 40 relapsed. Sixty-six patients (58%) achieved CR after one or two courses of CLAG-M, 49 (35%) were refractory, and 8 (7%) died early. WBC &gt;10 g/L and age &gt;34 yr were factors associated with increased risk of treatment failure. Hematological toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The probability of OS at 4 yr was 14% (95% CI 4-23%). OS was influenced by age, WBC &gt;10 g/L and poor karyotype in both univariate and multivariate analyses. The probability of 4 yr DFS was 30% for all 66 patients in CR (95% CI 11-49%). Poor karyotype was the only factor associated with decreased probability of DFS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CLAG-M is a well-tolerated and highly effective salvage regimen in poor risk refractory/relapsed AML.",M1

17926010,"Hairy Cell Leukemia.Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, characterized by splenomegaly and pancitopenia related to this. The lymphocytes present characteristic citoplasmatic projections and are positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Immunophenotyping is necessary to identify the co expression of CD103, CD25, CD11c associated with a typical B-cell clonally pattern and to make a differential diagnosis from other indolent malignancies. Despite the indolent clinical course, treatment is required to resolve symptoms related to splenomegaly and to reduce the incidence of severe infections that are the major complications and a common cause of death. In the past the treatment was only able to resolve the symptoms. In the revised literature, purine analog have been identified as the treatment of choice for this disease. Cladribrine (2-<e>CdA</e>) is able to induce more than 80% of complete remission and is also effective in relapsed patients. Rituximab after 2-CdA treatment can obtain a molecular response in most cases.

17706181,"Development and validation of a sensitive and specific HPLC assay of cladribine for pharmacokinetics studies in rats.PURPOSE: To develop and validate a sensitive and specific HPLC assay for cladribine (<e>CdA</e>) in plasma for pharmacokinetic studies in rats. METHODS: CdA and the internal standard AZT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chem. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-9A pump, a 3 im, 250 x 2.0 mm I.D. high speed C18 column (Jupitertrade mark), preceded by a 5 im 4 4 mm I.D. C18 guard column (Licrocarttrade mark), an Agilent Model 1050 UV-VIS detector and a 3395 Integrator. The mobile phase was made up of 0.01M KH2PO4 (pH 5): methanol: acetonitrile 90:5:5). The system was operated at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, and UV wavelength at 265 nm, and an operating pressure of ca. 1.56 kpsi. Extraction of cladribine and AZT from plasma was achieved by solid phase extraction using 100 mg/mL C18 SPE columns Extra-septrade mark). The assay was validated for sensitivity, precision, specificity and application for pharmacokinetic study in rats. RESULTS: Under these conditions, the average retention times of CdA and AZT were 13.5 and 21 min, respectively, and recoveries were between 80 - 95%. Standard curve constructed from plasma standards was linear from 0.1 ug/mL to 1 ug/mL with regression coefficient (r2) 0.99 or greater. Sensitivity assessed by on column injection was &lt; 1 ng. Using a 50-uL plasma sample size, the mean intra assay variations 0.1 ug/mL were 7%, and inter assay variations over a period of 3 months for 5 separate batches were less than 20%. The assay was used to study a single dose pharmacokinetic study of CdA in rats after a 2 mg/kg subcutaneous injection. CONCLUSION: The described HPLC assay has adequate sensitivity and specificity to study pharmacokinetics of CdA in rats, and could be adapted also to clinical pharmacokinetic studies.",M1
17635235,"Rituximab plus cladribine with or without cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the feasibility, effectiveness and toxicity of combined regimens consisting of rituximab and cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) (RC) and RC plus cyclophosphamide (RCC) in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: The RC regimen consisted of rituximab given on day 1 and 2-CdA (days 2-6). The RCC protocol included rituximab (day 1), 2-CdA (days 2-4) and cyclophosphamide given on days 2-4. The courses were re-administered at time intervals of 4 weeks or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. RESULTS: Forty-six patients with CLL entered the study. Eighteen patients were treated with RC and 28 with RCC regimen. The median number of courses administered were three cycles (range 1-6). Three (6.5%) patients (95% CI: 1-14%) achieved a complete response and 31 (67%) patients (95% CI: 50-83%) a partial response. According to the particular regimen, the overall response rate was obtained in 12 (67%) patients treated with RC (95% CI: 45-89%) and in 22 patients (78%) treated with RCC (95% CI: 62-93%). The median progression free survival of responders to RC/RCC regimens was 12 months (range 4-46). Hypersensitivity to rituximab occurred in 16 (33%) patients, mostly during the first infusion of the drug. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in six (13%) patients, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in three (9%) patients and grade 3/4 infections were observed in ten (28%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that both RC and RCC regimens are feasible in heavily pretreated patients with CLL, showing also distinct therapeutic activity and relatively low toxicity, even in patients previously treated with cladribine-based protocols.",M1
17581598,"Drosophila deoxyribonucleoside kinase mutants with enhanced ability to phosphorylate purine analogs.Transduced deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNK) can be used to kill recipient cells in combination with nucleoside prodrugs. The Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate dNK (Dm-dNK) displays a superior turnover rate and has a great plasticity regarding its substrates. We used directed evolution to create Dm-dNK mutants with increased specificity for several nucleoside analogs (NAs) used as anticancer or antiviral drugs. Four mutants were characterized for the ability to sensitize Escherichia coli toward analogs and for their substrate specificity and kinetic parameters. The mutants had a reduced ability to phosphorylate pyrimidines, while the ability to phosphorylate purine analogs was relatively similar to the wild-type enzyme. We selected two mutants, for expression in the osteosarcoma 143B, the glioblastoma U-87M-G and the breast cancer MCF7 cell lines. The sensitivities of the transduced cell lines in the presence of the NAs fludarabine (F-AraA), cladribine (<e>CdA</e>), vidarabine and cytarabine were compared to the parental cell lines. The sensitivity of 143B cells was increased by 470-fold in the presence of CdA and of U-87M-G cells by 435-fold in the presence of F-AraA. We also show that a choice of the selection and screening system plays a crucial role when optimizing suicide genes by directed evolution.",M1

Thirty six patients, 14 with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 10 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 5 with follicular lymphoma (FL), 3 with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and 4 with T-cell lymphoma were enrolled to the study. The CMC protocol consisted of 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg in a 2-hour infusion on days 1 through 3, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1 and cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1. The CMC courses were repeated at intervals of 4 weeks. Thirty three patients were available for evaluation of response. Overall response rate (OR) was 58% (95% CI, 41--75%). Seven patients (21%; 95% CI, 7--35%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 12 patients (36%; 95% CI, 20--52%) achieved a partial response (PR). Seven of 19 patients with CR/PR are still in remission with a median follow-up of 3 months (range, 2-17 months). The median failure-free survival (FFS) was 5 months (range, 2-17 months). The median overall survival (OS) for the entire group was 9 months (range, 0.1-7 months). There was a significant difference in OS between responders and nonresponders after CMC therapy (log rank test, P = 0.015). When different disease status before CMC treatment was considered, a trend toward longer survival of recurrent patients was observed (log rank test, P = 0.08). Grade 3-4 neutropenia developed in 14 (39%) patients, and 16 episodes (15%) of grade 3-4 infections were observed. Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia or anemia was seen in 9 patients (25%) and 10 patients (28%), respectively. The results of our study show that the CMC regimen is effective salvage therapy with acceptable toxicity in heavily pretreated patients with NHL including MCL and DLBCL.",M1
17541398,"Chromosomal translocations independently predict treatment failure, treatment-free survival and overall survival in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with cladribine.Chromosomal translocations represent an important prognostic indicator in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). However, their value had been neither determined in homogeneously treated patients nor compared to that of IgV(H) mutational status. Sixty-five B-CLL patients were investigated using cytogenetics, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), analysis of IgV(H) and of TP53 mutational status before treatment with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>). Translocations (n=45) were detected in 42% of the patients, including both balanced (n=12) and unbalanced (n=33) types. IgV(H) was mutated in 43% of the patients. Patients with translocations were more heavily pretreated (P=0.05), presented with more complex karyotypes (P&lt;0.001), 17p abnormalities and TP53 mutations, and had a higher failure rate (59 vs 21% in patients without translocations, P=0.004). Patients with unbalanced translocations displayed a shorter median treatment-free survival (TFS, 6.9 vs 35.9 months, log rank 22.72, P&lt;0.001) and overall survival (OS, 13.0 vs 68.0 months, log rank 16.51, P&lt;0.001), as compared to patients without translocation. In multivariate analysis, unbalanced translocations were independently associated with therapeutic failure, short TFS and short OS. IgV(H) mutational status was independently associated with risk of failure and TFS, but not OS. In B-CLL patients treated with CdA, translocations are strong predictors of outcome.",M1
17455311,"Analysis of outcome for patients with mass lesions of the central nervous system due to Langerhans cell histiocytosis treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine.PURPOSE: To assess the activity and tolerability of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CDA</e>) in treating mass lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) due to Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of eight children and four adults with CNS LCH who were treated with 2-CDA were reviewed. The pattern of CNS disease included involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gadolinium enhancing parenchymal as well as dural and choroid plexus based mass lesions, and atrophy. 2-CDA (5-13 mg/m(2)/day) was given on 3-5 consecutive days and repeated every 2-8 weeks for a period ranging from 3 to 12 months. RESULTS: Eight patients demonstrated a complete radiographic response to 2-CDA with resolution of all enhancing mass lesions and four patients showed a sustained, partial radiographic response. One patient died from a non-treatment related cause without evidence of LCH on autopsy. With a follow-up ranging from 2 to 10 years after completion of therapy, the 11 surviving patients remain in continuous remission or are progression free. Prolonged bone marrow suppression was the most common toxicity (four patients). Permanent sequelae of CNS LCH, such as panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus (DI) and neurocognitive dysfunction, were not found to be reversible with 2-CDA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 2-CDA is an active agent in patients with CNS LCH, with the possible exception of neurodegenerative disease, and should be further evaluated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial for LCH patients with enhancing mass lesions of the CNS.",M1
17209059,"Cladribine in a weekly versus daily schedule for untreated active hairy cell leukemia: final report from the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-<e>CdA</e>) treatment-associated infections may shorten potentially long-term survival in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). In search of the optimal mode of 2-CdA administration, 132 patients with untreated HCL were randomized to receive either standard 5-day 2-CdA protocol or a novel schedule of 6 weekly 2-CdA infusions suggested to be less toxic. Analysis of treatment response confirmed similar complete remission rates, overall response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in both 2-CdA protocols. However, we did not observe lower toxicity in the weekly schedule. Of special interest, no significant differences were found in the rate of grade 3/4 infections (18% for daily and 26% for weekly protocol, difference -8.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -23.2% to 6.9%; P = .28) and the rate of septic deaths (3% for daily and 2% for weekly protocol, difference 1.4%; 95% CI -4.3% to 7.0%; P = .64). In conclusion, HCL treatment with weekly 2-CdA infusions is equally effective but no safer than the standard 5-day 2-CdA protocol.",M1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of SDX-101 combined with agents proven to be effective as first-line treatment of B-CLL: the purine nucleoside analogs, fludarabine (FA) and cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>), and the monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab; ALT) and anti-CD20 (rituximab; RIT). The cytotoxicity and specific pro-apoptotic effects of the study drugs on B-CLL cells were assessed in vitro in samples from overall 37 untreated patients. The combinations of SDX-101 with 2-CdA, FA or RIT exerted additive effects in B-CLL cells, with the following combination indices (CI): 0.89 for SDX-101 + 2-CdA, 0.95 for SDX-101 + RIT, and 1.17 for SDX-101 + FA. The main mechanism of these interactions was caspase-mediated apoptosis. The SDX-101 plus ALT combination resulted in only sub-additive cytotoxicity (CI = 1.25). In conclusion, these data obtained in vitro indicate that addition of 2-CdA, FA or RIT to SDX-101 significantly enhance cytotoxicity in B-CLL cells.",M1
17137556,"Pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway increases sensitivity to 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>) in the B-cell leukemia cell line EHEB.EHEB leukemic cells, which are derived from a patient suffering B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), display intermediate sensitivity to the purine analogue 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA). Because the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can rescue cancer cells from apoptotic signals, we investigated MAPK/ERK signaling in EHEB cells in response to CdA. We observed that CdA, at concentrations around its IC50, dose- and time-dependently increased the phosphorylation state of ERK 1/2 (p-ERK), indicating an activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. This activation required CdA metabolism and de novo protein synthesis, and was independent on caspase activation. Interruption of ERK signaling, using the specific MEK inhibitors U-0126 and PD-98059, significantly enhanced CdA cytotoxicity, evaluated by the MTT assay. Drug interaction analysis showed synergism in the majority of combinations between CdA and MEK inhibitors tested. MEK inhibitors also dramatically increased apoptosis induced by CdA alone, evaluated by caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Collectively, these observations show that ERK 1/2 activation elicited by CdA serves as a cytoprotective function and suggest that inhibitors of this pathway could be combined with CdA in the treatment of selected hematological malignancies.",M1

METHODS: For this multicenter, single-arm, Phase II study, 44 patients with treatment-naive, stage III or IV, indolent NHL (International Working Formulation subtypes A, B, and C) were enrolled. Patients received 0.14 mg/kg per day of 2-CdA as a 2-hour bolus infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days until maximal response or a total of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were eligible for response evaluation. The overall response rate was 100% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 90.8-100%), and the complete response rate was 31.6% (95% CI, 17.5-48.7%). In the intent-to-treat population, the median failure-free survival was 2.0 years (95% CI, 1.3-3.4 years), and the overall survival rate was 7.0 years (95% CI, 4.3-9.4 years). Six patients had sustained remissions that lasted a median of 8.7 years (range, from 5.9 years to &gt; or =11 years). Although 68% of patients experienced at least 1 grade 3 or 4 event, consisting primarily of myelosuppression, severe infections were rare, with only 8 grade 3 infections. Four late malignancies (prostate adenocarcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and myelodysplasia) and 4 patients with large cell transformation were reported.

Treatment with purine analogs such as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) is associated with excellent remission rates and long-term survival. Although the majority of patients achieve a complete remission (CR), most have minimal residual disease detected by sensitive methods. Despite the long term disease-free survival, approximately 36% of patients relapse and many require further therapy. Repeat administration of 2-CdA is very effective in achieving a second CR. Recently, new agents such rituximab and BL22 were shown to be effective in the treatment of relapsed and refractory disease.",M1
17065055,"Inhibition of the ERK pathway promotes apoptosis induced by 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine in the B-cell leukemia cell line EHEB.2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>) is a nucleoside analogue active in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Although the mechanism of action of CdA has been extensively investigated in leukemic cells, the possibility that this nucleoside analogue interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway has never been explored. In this study, we show that CdA, at concentrations close to the IC50, activated the ERK pathway in the B-cell line EHEB. Because activation of this pathway is assumed to exert anti-apoptotic effect, we combined CdA with inhibitors of the ERK pathway. The latter were found to enhance CdA-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the efficacy of CdA could be strengthened by combination with inhibitors of the ERK pathway.",M1
17065054,"Micro-array analysis of resistance for gemcitabine results in increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase subunits.To study in detail the relation between gene expression and resistance against gemcitabine, a cell line was isolated from a tumor for which gemcitabine resistance was induced in vivo. Similar to the in vivo tumor, resistance in this cell line, C 26-G, was not related to deficiency of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). Micro-array analysis showed increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunits M1 and M2 as confirmed by real time PCR analysis (28- and 2.7-fold, respectively). In cell culture, moderate cross-resistance (about 2-fold) was observed to 1-ss-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 2-chloro-2'deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>), LY231514 (ALIMTA), and cisplatin (CDDP), and pronounced cross-resistance (&gt;23-fold) to 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG).

Phosphorylation of the drug to CdAMP by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and its subsequent conversion to CdATP is essential for its efficacy. DCK deficiency is a common mechanism of resistance to NA, which could be overcome by the pronucleotide approach. The latter consists of using the nucleoside monophosphate conjugated to a lipophilic group enabling CdAMP to enter the cells by passive diffusion. In this study, we show that cycloSaligenyl-2-chloro-2 '-deoxyadenosine monophosphate (cycloSal-CdAMP) is 10-fold more potent that CdA in a dCK-deficient lymphoma cell line. These results suggest that the use of cycloSal-nucleotides could be a strategy to counteract resistance caused by dCK deficiency.",M1

This study retrospectively analysed the clinical records of 13 patients who were seen in the department for recurrent LCH. These patients were treated consecutively with 2-CdA chemotherapy between July 1997 and May 2005. Median age at diagnosis was 4 years 7 months and median pre-treatment duration of disease was 16.4 months. Four children received 0.1 mg kg-1 per day for 7 days and nine patients 5 mg m-2 per day for 5 days, repeated every 21 days. The maximum number of courses of 2-CdA per patient was limited to six. Seventy-six courses of 2-CdA were administered without difficulty. All 13 patients (100%) had a clinical response documented by radiographic investigation. Nine patients did not require additional therapy and remain in complete remission (CR). Four remaining children are currently disease-free after receiving other therapy as irradiation (two cases) or maintenance chemotherapy (vinblastine, prednisone and 6-mercaptopurine) (one case) or chemotherapy (vinblastine) + irradiation (one child) ( Table I). Hematologic toxicity was minimal and no infectious complications were documented. Median follow-up after initiation of 2-CdA treatment was 4 years 3 months (range 7 months - 8 years 2 months). This experience confirms the reported efficacy of 2-CdA in the treatment of LCH. However, further studies are needed to determine the role of this agent in high-risk patient who did not achieve complete remission after 2-CdA administration.",M1

In RCD II, transition into enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is seen frequently. We have evaluated the effect of cladribine (2-<e>CDA</e>), a purine analogue inducing T-cell depletion, on clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic parameters, as well as the toxicity and side effects in a group of RCD II patients. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, 17 patients were included (8 men, 9 women). All patients had a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma gene and immunophenotyping showed an aberrant T-cell population lacking surface expression of CD3, CD8, and T-cell receptor alphabeta, in the presence of expression of surface CD103 and intracytoplasmic CD3. Treatment consisted of 2-CDA (0.1 mg/kg/day) intravenously for 5 days, given in 1-3 courses every 6 months depending on the response. RESULTS: All patients tolerated 2-CDA without serious side effects. Six patients (35.8%) showed a clinical improvement (weight gain, improvement of diarrhea, and hypoalbuminemia). In 10 patients (58.8%) a significant histologic improvement and in 6 patients (35.2%) a significant decrease in aberrant T cells was seen. Seven patients (41.1%) developed EATL and died subsequently. One patient died of progressive refractory state with emaciation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 2-CDA in RCD II is feasible, well tolerated, and can induce clinical and histologic improvement as well as a significant decrease of aberrant T cells in a subgroup of patients, albeit it does not prevent EATL development. However, the earlier reported potential risk of precipitating an overt lymphoma should be taken into consideration.",M1
16948126,"Rituximab combined with cladribine or with cladribine and cyclophosphamide in heavily pretreated patients with indolent lymphoproliferative disorders and mantle cell lymphoma.BACKGROUND: In vitro studies have shown synergistic or additive interactions between rituximab and purine nucleoside analogues. The results of recent clinical trials seem to confirm these preclinical observations. METHODS: For the current study, the authors evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of combined regimens that consisted of either rituximab plus cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) (the RC regimen) or RC plus cyclophosphamide (the RCC regimen) in the treatment of patients with heavily pretreated, indolent lymphoid malignancies. Fifty-four adult patients with recurrent or refractory, low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LG-NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were treated according to the RC/RCC regimens. The RC protocol consisted of intravenous rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on Day 1 and 2-CdA at a dose of .12 mg/kg per day on Days 2 through 6. The RCC protocol consisted of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on Day 1, 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/m(2) on Days 2 through 4, and intravenous cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) per day on Days 2 to 4. The RC/RCC courses were repeated at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with B-CLL, 12 patients with LG-NHL and 9 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) entered the study. Thirty-three patients (61%) had recurrent disease after prior therapy, and 21 patients (39%) had refractory disease. Thirty-one patients were treated on the RC regimen, and 23 patients were treated on the RCC regimen. Six patients (11%) achieved a complete response, and 33 patients (60%) achieved a partial response. The median failure-free survival of responders was 10.5 months. The treatment revealed tolerability, with episodes of severe neutropenia (Grade 3 and 4 [according to World Health Organization criteria]) observed in 6 patients (11%), episodes of Grade 3 and 4 infections observed in 11 patients (20%), and episodes of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia observed in 4 patients (7%).

Study end points were complete response (CR), overall response, minimal residual disease (MRD), progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. From January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2003, 508 patients from 15 hematology departments were randomized. Compared with 2-CdA, CMC induced higher CR rate (36% vs 21%, P = .004), and a trend for higher CR rate with CC was observed (29% vs 21%, P = .08). Furthermore, the percentage of patients who were in CR and were MRD negative was higher in CMC compared with 2-CdA (23% vs 14%, P = .042). There were no differences in overall response, progression-free survival, and overall survival among treatment groups. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred more frequently in CC (32%) and CMC (38%) than in 2-CdA (20%) (P = .01 and P = .004, respectively). Infections were more frequent in CMC compared with 2-CdA (40% vs 27%, P = .02). In conclusion, CMC used in first-line treatment of CLL results in a higher CR rate and suppresses MRD more efficiently than 2-CdA monotherapy, although associates with increased toxicity. No important differences in efficacy and toxicity were found between CC and 2-CdA regimens.",M1

To successfully expand genetically engineered cells in vivo, an appropriate balance must be achieved between systemic toxicity induced by the selecting agent and the expansion of modified cells. METHOD: In this study, we investigate retroviral transfer of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase I (cN-I) for protection and selection of gene-modified cells when treated with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone and in combination. We also attempt to design a treatment strategy for the potential in vivo selection of cN-I-modified cells by administering 5-FU to mice prior to 2-CdA treatment. RESULTS: Our results show that cN-I can be transferred by recombinant retroviruses, and that enforced expression of cN-I protects murine fibroblast and hematopoietic progenitor cells from the cytotoxic effects of 2-CdA and/or 5-FU. Furthermore, we show that the combined administration of 5-FU and 2-CdA potentiates hematopoietic stem cell toxicity. However, the treatment also results in severe myelosuppression. CONCLUSION: These results show that while cN-I provides both protective and selective benefits to gene-modified cells in vitro, selection requires a treatment strategy that is likely too toxic to consider cN-I as an in vivo selectable marker.",M1

Here we present the final report of this study. MATERIAL/METHODS: Of 229 patients, 126 received 2-CdA+P and 103 Chl+P. Patients with no response or progression after three courses or who relapsed earlier than 12 months after completing one treatment were switched to the other. Patients who relapsed later were retreated with the same schedule as before. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were retreated with 2-CdA+P and 19 with Chl+P. Overall response (and complete response) rates were 35% (6%) and 47% (16%), respectively. In 50 patients initially treated with Chl+P and then with 2-CdA+P, complete response (CR) was achieved in 12 (24%) and overall response (OR) in 32 (64%). In 28 patients originally treated with 2-CdA+P and then with Chl+P, CR in 1 (3%, p=0.01) and OR in 6 (21%, p=0.003) were obtained.

Changes noticed 4 weeks after Cladribine administration are the following: decrease in amount of mitochondria, the presence of numerous vacuoles, changes in the structure of the brush border, presence of numerous glycogen granules, and the presence of a diluted cytoplasm around the nucleus. Giving 2-CdA at the dose of 0.07 mg/kg b.m./24 h for 6 days in three courses leads to similar changes in proximal convoluted tubules with more extensive damages of the brush border.

16142330,"Old and new insights into the mechanisms of action of two nucleoside analogs active in lymphoid malignancies: fludarabine and cladribine (review).This review focuses on two chemotherapeutic agents belonging to the family of purine analogs, 9-beta-D-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine-5'-monophosphate (F-ara-AMP, fludarabine), which is the soluble form of F-ara-A, and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>, cladribine). Both compounds display remarkable activity in malignancies arising from the clonal expansion of lymphocytes, and particularly in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). These analogs are prodrugs that must be converted into their respective nucleotides as an essential requirement for cytotoxicity. Triphosphate analogs inhibit various processes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. Moreover, the effect of nucleoside analogs in leukemic cells may involve modulation of apoptosis pathways, cell-cycle control, or signal transduction pathways. These findings are of crucial importance because alterations in these pathways may be involved in leukemic cell resistance toward nucleoside analogs and, hence, constitute new molecular targets to sensitize leukemic cells to these drugs.",M1

16044347,"Quantitation of synergism of arabinosylcytosine and cladribine against the growth of arabinosylcytosine-resistant human lymphoid cells.This report presents a quantitative analysis of the synergistic interaction of arabinosylcytosine (araC) and cladribine (<e>CdA</e>) in human H9-lymphoid cell lines sensitive and resistant to araC (H9-araC cells). H9-araC cells obtained by cultivation of H9 cells in the presence of 0.5 microM arabinosylcytosine (araC) had lower deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) than the parental cell line. The IC50 values of araC and CdA calculated by using median-effect analysis and CalcuSyn software were: 0.55 microM and 1.16 microM for CdA and 0.0058 microM and 3.5 microM for araC in H9 and H9-araC cells, respectively. These values were reduced to 0.10 microM and 0.38 microM for CdA and to 0.004 microM and to 0.77 microM for araC when the drugs were used in combination. Computerized simulation of dose reduction index (DRI) indicated that at 50-99% growth inhibition levels, the doses of araC could be reduced by 2.0 to 11.9-fold and 2.9 to 5.3-fold and the doses of CdA by 5.9 and 183.7-fold and 3.1 to 164.8-fold in H9 and H9-araC cells, respectively, when the drugs are used in combination. Assessment by combination index (CI) analysis showed that the combination exhibited moderate to strong synergistic lympho-cytotoxic effects. CdA metabolic studies (influx and activation) in the presence of deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, or araC suggested that CdA enters cells by a deoxyadenosine-inhibitable transport system, which is different than that of araC and deoxycytidine transport system. Thus, in addition to the known mechanisms, other mechanisms might be involved in the metabolism of CdA. The demonstration that araC and CdA combinations exert synergistic cytotoxicity even in the resistant cells raises hope that such a combination may be useful in tumors that were found resistant to these drugs.",M1
16019537,"Merkel cell carcinoma in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with cladribine and rituximab.Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon, neuroendocrine skin tumor with an aggressive clinical course. The etiology of the disease is unknown, although sun exposure and immunosuppression may play a role in its development. Coexistence of MCC with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is extremely rare and to our knowledge it has been previously described in only 8 patients. We report a 51-year-old woman who presented with a red lump on the right cheek diagnosed as MCC. She had been diagnosed as having CLL 3 years earlier and was treated with 4 courses of cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and subsequently with 4 courses of 2-CdA combined with rituximab. MCC was diagnosed on the basis of histological and immunohistochemical evaluation 2 months after the last course of 2-CdA and rituximab. Surgical excision with tumor-free margins was performed and local adjuvant radiotherapy was applied. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the cervical lymph node specimens showed monotonous and diffuse infiltrate of small CD5+, CD20+, CD23+ lymphocytes and no MCC cells were present. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of MCC occurring in CLL patients soon after treatment with 2-CdA and/or rituximab. The development of MCC in our patient may suggest that this complication rarely observed in CLL patients may have a link with strongly immunosuppressive therapy with 2-CdA and rituximab.",M1

In this study, a combination of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) chemotherapy was evaluated in patients with HES. METHODS: Nine patients with HES were treated with ara-C (1 g/m(2)) given intravenously over 2 hours at 0 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours; and 2-CdA (12 mg/m(2) per day) was given as a continuous intravenous infusion over 5 days starting at 24 hours. A second course of the same therapy was administered in patients who had a response. RESULTS: All patients had signs and symptoms of end-organ involvement. The median time from diagnosis to therapy was 25 months. Seven patients had received prior therapies. Five patients (55%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 1 after receiving 2 courses of therapy. Elimination of eosinophilia was accompanied by the resolution of symptoms. The median disease-free survival and overall survival after the diagnosis for patients who achieved CR was 26 months and 44 months, respectively. Treatment was tolerated well. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 28% of the 14 courses that were given. The median time to recovery from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 17 days and 39 days, respectively.

Seven patients with hairy cell leukemia were diagnosed between January 1990 till December 2003. Diagnosis in all the patients was established by bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsy along with TRAP. In two patients the diagnosis was supplemented by flowcytometry and in another two patients by splenectomy. Six patients were male while one was female. Mean age was 47.7 years (range 36-64). Most common presenting features were pallor and weakness (n=5). All patients had splenomegaly. Blood count at presentation revealed that one patient had bicytopenia, two had isolated thrombocytopenia, and three had pancytopenia. Treatment responses were evaluable in seven patients. Complete response was seen in six patients (85.7%). One patient died after two months due to sepsis while 3 (50%) patients relapsed. Those who relapsed received another course of CDA and have maintained remission with a median duration of response of 48 months (20-48).

15856358,"A multicenter, open, noncomparative, phase II study of the combination of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine), cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and mitoxantrone as induction therapy in refractory acute myeloid leukemia: a report of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group.Purine nucleoside analogues, cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-<e>CdA</e>) and fludarabine (FAMP) are active agents in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Synergistic interaction between FAMP or 2-CdA with cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. The current multicenter phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of induction treatment consisting of 2-CdA (5 mg/m2), Ara-C (2 g/m2), mitoxantrone (MIT, 10 mg/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CLAG-M) in refractory AML. In case of partial remission, a second CLAG-M was administered. Patients in complete remission (CR) received consolidation courses based on high-dose Ara-C and MIT with or without 2-CdA. Forty-three patients from five centers were registered: 25 primary resistant and 18 relapsed. CR was achieved in 21 (49%) patients, 20 (47%) were refractory and 2 (5%) died early. Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The overall survival (OS; 1 year) for the 42 patients as a whole and the 20 patients in CR were 43% and 73%, respectively. Disease-free survival (1 year) was 68.6%. None of the analyzed prognostic factors influenced the CR and OS probability significantly. We conclude that CLAG-M regimen has significant antileukemia activity in refractory AML, which seems to be better than the activity of many other regimens. The toxicity of the treatment is acceptable.",M1
15813915,"In vitro cytotoxic effect of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with purine nucleoside analogues on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells.OBJECTIVE: The anti-tumour in vitro activity of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341, VELCADE) in combination with purine nucleoside analogues, cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and fludarabine (FA) was tested in lymphocytes derived from 26 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining, and apoptosis by annexin-V and caspase activation flow cytometry assays. Additionally, expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax, Bak, Bid, Bcl-w, Bcl-2, XIAP and Mcl-1 was evaluated in B-CLL lymphocytes. RESULTS: Bortezomib alone induced significant, dose-dependent cytotoxicity starting from the low concentration 2.5 nm, inducing apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Combination of this agent with 2-CdA or FA resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity when compared with that mediated by single drugs. The observed increase was especially evident when 5 nm of bortezomib were combined with suboptimal doses of 2-CdA or FA. The combination index (CI) was 0.87 for bortezomib + 2-CdA and 0.82 for bortezomib + FA, indicating an evident additive effect of these combinations. Moreover, B-CLL cells were more sensitive to proteasome inhibitor used alone or combined with 2-CdA or FA comparing to CD3+ lymphocytes. Corresponding to enhanced apoptosis, the expression levels of several apoptosis-regulating proteins were altered. The most pronounced changes were down-regulation of XIAP and up-regulation of Bid proteins by the combination of bortezomib with either 2-CdA or FA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that the in vitro cytotoxic effect through proteasome inhibition by bortezomib can be increased substantially with low doses of the purine nucleoside analogues, 2-CdA and FA, and that this effect on B-CLL cell is selectively higher than on normal, CD3-positive lymphocytes.",M1

However, few studies have reported long-term outcomes after 2-CdA treatment. Between January 1990 and June 2003, 86 consecutive patients with HCL were treated with a single 7-day course of 2-CdA by continuous infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day. Of the 86 patients (mean age: 49 years), 67 patients (79%) achieved a complete remission (CR); 18 patients (21%) achieved a partial remission (PR); and 1 patient's response was unable to be assessed. The progression-free survival (PFS) for initial relapse after 12 years was 54%. At a median follow-up of 9.7 years (range, 0.3-13.8 years), 31 (36%) of 85 patients relapsed. There were 23 relapsed patients treated with a second cycle of 2-CdA; 2 patients were treated with alternative agents; and 6 patients were observed. Of the 23 relapsed patients retreated with 2-CdA, 12 (52%) achieved a CR and 7 (30%) patients achieved a PR (overall response rate: 83%). The overall survival (OS) rate after 12 years was 87%.

We previously described initial palliative benefit from 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) in such instances. The purpose of this study is to provide long-term follow-up on the durability of response in the initial cohort and in additional subsequent cases. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with histologically confirmed MMM who had palliative therapy with 2-CdA. Clinical characteristics and information on subsequent clinical course were abstracted at the time of diagnosis of MMM and at initiation of 2-CdA therapy until death. RESULTS: To date, we have used 2-CdA as palliative therapy in 14 patients with MMM. After a median of four cycles of therapy, responses for hepatomegaly occurred in 56% of patients, thrombocytosis 50%, leukocytosis 55%, and anemia 40%. Cytopenias were frequent but usually transient and without clinical consequence. Responses occurred usually by the second cycle; median duration of response was 6 months (range, 2-19) after completion of 2-CdA therapy. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed relevant and frequently durable palliation of symptoms in about half the patients. 2-CdA is a reasonable palliative option in postsplenectomy patients with MMM who have problematic myeloproliferation.",M1

Western blot technique was performed to estimate expression/proteolytic degradation of generally accepted apoptotic markers, i.e., Bcl-2 protein, lamin B, PARP-1, and caspase-3 in leukemic cells isolated from blood samples of patients before treatment and subjected to drug(s) administration. The decrease of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression and proteolytic cleavage of nuclear proteins--lamin B and PARP-1 were observed in leukemic cells of patients treated according to the above therapy protocols, however, each to a different level among the studied groups. The obtained results indicated also that procaspase-3 was cleaved and activated in leukemic cells of three drug(s) treated groups. However, the cleavage of procaspase-3 and the generation of fragments with mol. mass of 17/20 kDa occurred especially effectively among patients treated according to CMC regimen. The changes in expression/proteolytic degradation of the above selected apoptotic markers, are accompanied by the appearance of apoptotic morphology in leukemic cells originated from blood of patients treated with the above drug(s) in comparison to untreated ones.",M1

A low deoxycytidine kinase activity and CdATP accumulation, and a lack of p21 induction despite p53 phosphorylation and accumulation may account for the inability of CdA to block the cell cycle. An alternative pathway involving pRb phosphorylation seems implicated in the CdA-induced increase in G1 to S phase progression.",M1

15571254,"Selective increase of dATP pools upon activation of deoxycytidine kinase in lymphocytes: implications in apoptosis.Stimulation of the activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the principal deoxynucleoside salvage enzyme, has been recently considered as a protective cellular response to a wide range of agents interfering with DNA repair and apoptosis. In light of this, the potential contribution of dCK activation to apoptosis induction--presumably by supplying dATP or its analogues for the apoptosome formation--deserves consideration. Two-hour exposure of human tonsillar lymphocytes to 2-chloro-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>) led to a two-fold activation of dCK. This activation process was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha, a potent inhibitor of p53. When the dNTP pools were determined, both deoxypyrimidine triphosphate and dGTP pools were reduced after the treatments, while dATP levels elevated by 62%, 77% and 50% in the CdA, aphidicolin and etoposide-treated cells, respectively. We assume that dCK activation elicited by cellular damage might be a proapoptotic factor in terms of generating dATP well before the release of cytochrome c and deoxyguanosine kinase from mitochondria.",M1

15558283,"The place of cladribine in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a 10-year experience in Poland.Cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) is structurally similar to another purine analog, fludarabine (FA), recently accepted in several centers as the first-line treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unfortunately, there is less experience with the use of 2-CdA than with FA in patients with CLL in the majority of Western countries. In the last decade we performed several phase II studies and two phase III randomized trials to evaluate the activity and toxicity of 2-CdA in previously treated and untreated patients with CLL. We have also compared the results of Polish studies with the data presented by other investigators. Similarly to FA this agent has been found to be more effective in previously untreated CLL than in patients refractory to or relapsed after conventional therapy with alkylating agents. In different studies the overall response (OR) rate ranged from 70 to 85% and complete response (CR) from 10 to 47%. Higher CR and OR rates in CLL patients treated with 2-CdA and prednisone than with chlorambucil and prednisone were confirmed in our multicenter, randomized study. Subsequently, we performed a multicenter, randomized study comparing 2-CdA alone with a combination of 2-CdA and cyclophosphamide (CC) or cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone (CMC). Our updated results seem to indicate that the CC program used as a first-line therapy in CLL gives higher CR and OR and better elimination of minimal residual disease (MRD) than 2-CdA alone. CC is also less myelotoxic than CMC. More recently, we have undertaken a phase II study to determine the efficacy and toxicity of 2-CdA combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in CLL and other refractory or relapsed indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. The preliminary results seem to be better than in similar patients previously treated in our institution with 2-CdA alone. In conclusion, the studies performed in the last decade in Poland and other countries have shown that 2-CdA used alone or in combination with other agents is, similarly to FA, a highly active and relatively safe agent in previously treated and untreated patients with CLL.",M1

Forty-five patients were enrolled, and 43 patients, including 34 with follicular lymphoma, were eligible. 2-CdA was given by continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg daily for 7 consecutive days, and this schedule was repeated every 4 weeks up to a maximum of 6 cycles. The overall and complete response rates were 58.1% (25/43; 90% confidence interval, 44.5%-70.9%) and 14.0% (6/43), respectively. The disease progression-free proportions of all 43 eligible and all 25 responding patients at 2 years were 30.3% and 48.1%, respectively. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of grade 3 or 4 were observed in 53.3% and 37.8% of patients, respectively, with prolonged cytopenia observed in patients with increased numbers of treatment cycles. Nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3 or greater included diarrhea, arrhythmia, malaise, and gastrointestinal bleeding in 1 patient each, an increase in glutamic-pyruvic transaminase level in 2 patients, and infection in 5 patients. Two treatment-related deaths were observed. Four patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at 13 months to 2 years after completion of the 2-CdA treatments. 2-CdA is an active agent with acceptable toxicity for refractory or relapsed indolent lymphoma; however, prolonged myelosuppression and the potential development of MDS should be carefully monitored.",M1

R115777 was added to the culture alone or in combinations with PNA. We showed that R115777 used alone or together with PNA at all combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of AML CFU-L, when compared with normal CFU-GM (P &lt; 0.01). In addition, the drugs used in combinations of two higher concentrations in significantly higher degree inhibited CFU-L colony growth, when compared either with R115777 or with any of PNA used alone (P &lt; 0.04). IC(50) for R115777 were 67.1 and 121.9 nm for AML CFU-L and normal CFU-GM, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of AML the combination index was 0.89 and 1.16, respectively, for the combination of R115777 with 2-CdA and R115777 with F-ara-A. An additive effect on AML CFU-L cells and subadditive effect on normal CFU-GM were seen. To assess a proapoptotic effect, the drugs were added to the liquid cultures at the same concentrations as for clonogenic assays. A significant increase in the rate of apoptosis induced by combinations of drugs in comparison with single agents was observed. In conclusion, the combination of R115777 with both PNA could be more effective than the drugs used alone. However, further experimental studies on the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of myeloid leukemia patients are warranted.",M1
15522063,"Rituximab as treatment for minimal residual disease in hairy cell leukaemia.Purine analogues have dramatically improved the outcome of patients affected by hairy cell leukemia (HCL), although complete eradication of disease was achieved in few cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of Rituximab in eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) in HCL patients after a pre-treatment with 2-chloro-deoxy-adenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>). Ten patients received four cycles of Rituximab after administration of Cladribrine. Before starting anti-CD20 antibody, two patients were in complete remission, six in partial remission and two showed no significant response to Cladribrine. All cases resulted IgH-positive. Median time from the last 2-CdA infusion was 5.7 months. Eight of 10 patients [four in partial remission (PR), two in complete remission (CR) and two unresponsive after 2-CdA] were evaluable for response. Two months after the end of anti-CD20 therapy, all evaluated patients presented a complete haematological remission. Moreover, Rituximab increased percentage of molecular remission up to 100% 1 yr after the end of treatment. Interestingly, in all cases but one, including those persistently polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive, semi-quantitative molecular analyses showed MRD levels lower than those found before Rituximab administration. Toxicity was very mild. The present results not only confirm the therapeutic effect of Rituximab, but also show its relevance in eradicating MRD in HCL.",M1

We report on a patient with a 20-year history of relapsing multisystem LCH who developed progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms, including diplopia, ataxia, and mental deterioration. There was a regression of lesions in the brain stem and cerebellum following chemotherapy with cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) as evidenced by positron emission tomography (PET) scans. In conclusion, our experience is encouraging for the use of cladribine in CNS LCH. PET may be a useful modality for the monitoring of CNS disease activity in LCH and provides additional information in comparison with NMR imaging.",M1
15332715,"Role of low-dose 2-<e>CdA</e> in refractory or resistant lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma.Cladribrine (2-CdA), a purine analogue active on both dividing and resting lymphocytes, plays an important role in the treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative malignancies such as Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Lymphoplasmocytic Lymphoma (LPL), Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM). With the aim of evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of low dose 2-CdA, 15 lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma patients, not eligible for more aggressive or standard therapies, because of age or poor performance status, were treated with the drug at a dose of 5 mg/m2, once a week for six total courses. All patients showed disease progression. Fourteen patients were valuable for response. In eleven out of these 14 (85.7%) disease progression stopped, with 21% having good hematological responses (one CR and two PR). The treatment was generally well tolerated, without serious infectious events. This schedule may be appropriate for the management of patients where the aim of the treatment is control of disease progression.",M1
15324388,"Cutaneous adverse reaction to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine with histological flame figures in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.INTRODUCTION: 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine or 2-<e>CdA</e>) is a purine analogue that has been used successfully in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). Moreover, it has been increasingly used to treat chronic lymphoproliferative syndromes and paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia. Cutaneous side-effects associated with this drug have seldom been described in cases of HCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia that presented generalized skin eruptions after treatment with 2-CdA. RESULTS: All patients had advanced disease, receiving 2-CdA as a second or third line chemotherapy. Skin lesions were severe and chemotherapy had to be discontinued. Histological examination of skin biopsies showed an eosinophil-rich infiltrate with flame figures, similar to what is observed in Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis). Corticosteroids were effective to control the eruptions. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous adverse reactions associated with 2-CdA have seldom been observed in the treatment of HCL. However, as this purine analogue has been used in more advanced cases these may be more frequent and severe. The pathophysiology of these lesions is unclear, but it is probably related to drug-induced change in T-cell imbalance in severely immunosuppressed patients.",M1
15291365,"Epstein-Barr virus positive large B-cell lymphoma arising in a patient previously treated with Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia.We describe the case of a patient treated with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine, <e>CdA</e> or Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia who subsequently developed an Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-positive polymorphous large B-cell lymphoma (p-LBCL). The time interval between Cladribine therapy and development of p-BCL was 11 months and morphologically resembled an EBV-positive post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Molecular genetic studies for EBV-clonality by Southern blot hybridization showed a clonal population of infected cells, implying that this was an EBV induced lesion. The chronology of events suggest that Cladribine, a purine analog which has been previously described to induce long-lasting immunodeficiency, can, in some cases, weaken the host defense mechanism to a level at which an innocuous EBV infection may transform the normal lymphoid cells into an aggressive neoplasm. Unlike most methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), which undergo spontaneous remission after discontinuation of therapy, LPDs secondary to purine analogs often fails to resolve after discontinuation of therapy and requires additional therapy. Our patient was treated with rituximab following the diagnosis of p-LBCL, with the goal of improving the pancytopenia to permit chemotherapy. However, the patient failed to show any dramatic improvements in counts, developed systemic symptoms and progressive ascites. He expired 3 weeks after a second dose of rituximab. Cladribine is a potent immunosuppressive agent and should be included with the list of immunosuppressive agents that may be associated with EBV-related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",M1
15291352,"Rituximab followed by cladribine in the treatment of heavily pretreated patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies.The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of combined therapy consisting of rituximab (RIT), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-<e>CdA</e>) (RC regimen) in patients with refractory or relapsed indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. Twenty six CD20 antigen positive patients, 15 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 11 with low grade non-Hodgin's lymphoma (LG-NHL) were enrolled to the study. Fourteen patients (53.8%) had refractory disease, the other 12 (46.2%) were recurrent after prior chemotherapy. RC regimen consisted of RIT at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in 6 h infusion on day 1 and 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, in 2 h infusion, given on days 2-6. The RC courses were repeated at 4 week intervals or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. Seventy eight cycles of RC with median of 3 cycles per patient were administered (range 1-5 cycles). Four patients (15.4%) (95% CI 1.5-29.3%), 1 with B-CLL and 3 with LG-NHL, achieved a complete response (CR). Fourteen patients (53,8%) (95%CI 34.6-72.9%), including 10 with B-CLL and 4 with LG-NHL, had a partial response (PR). Overall response rate (OR) was 69.2% (95%CI 51.4-86.9%) in the whole group, from 63.6% (95% CI 35.2 92.0%) in LG-NHL to 73.3% (95%CI 50.1-95.7%) in B-CLL patients. Twelve of 18 patients with CR/PR are still in remission, with the median follow up 10 (7-28 months). The median failure-free survival (FFS) of responders was 6.5 months. Hypersensitivity to RIT was the major toxicity of RC regimen, and occurred in 9 patients (34.6%), mostly only during the first infusion of RIT. Severe neutropenia (grade III) was seen in 3 patients (11.5%). Anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with RC treatment were observed in 5 (19.2%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively. Four episodes (15.4%) of grade III-IV infections were observed. There was no treatment related mortality. During the follow-up six patients (23.1%) died from the disease progression. In conclusion, the combination of RIT and 2-CdA is an effective and well tolerated treatment, even for heavily pre-treated patients, and the results seem to be better than in patients previously treated in our institution with 2-CdA alone. This regimen can be considered as an alternative treatment of CD-20 positive indolent lymphoproliferative disorders.",M1

Plasma (1 h), red blood cells (1 h) and faecal samples (0-24 h) were obtained from mice and monkeys, and urine samples (0-24 h) were obtained from these species and humans. 3. Unchanged cladribine (urine: 47% of the sample in human; 60% of the sample in mouse; 73% of the sample in monkey) and 10 metabolites, consisting of four phase I metabolites (M1-3, M7) and six phase II metabolites -- five glucuronides (M4, M6, M8-10) and one sulfate (M5) -- were profiled, characterized and tentatively identified in plasma, red blood cells, and faecal and urine samples on the basis of API ionspray-mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS data. 4. Metabolites were formed via the following three metabolic pathways: oxidative cleavage at the adenosine and deoxyribose linkage (A); oxidation at adenosine/deoxyribose (B); and conjugation (C). 5. Pathways A and B appear to be major steps, forming four oxidative/cleavage metabolites (M1-3, M7) (each 3-20% of the sample). 6. Pathway C along or in conjunction with pathways A and B produced cladribine glucuronide, cladribine sulfate and four glucuronides of oxidative/cleavage metabolites in minor/trace quantities (each &lt; or = 5% of the sample). 7. In addition, the in vitro metabolism of cladribine was conducted using rat and human liver microsomal fractions in the presence of an beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system. Unchanged cladribine (&gt; or = 90% of the sample) plus three minor metabolites, M1-3 (each &lt; 8% of the sample), were profiled and tentatively identified by thin-layer chromatography and MS data. 8. Cladribine is not extensively metabolized in vitro and in vivo in all species. However, humans appear to metabolize cladribine to a greater extent than other animals.",M1

In addition, the probability of obtaining another response with this drug in pts who relapsed after 2-CdA treatment will be addressed. A total of 44 consecutive pts (34 males, 10 females) with a median age of 57 years (range 33-77) at the time of initiation of 2-CdA treatment were analyzed. In all, 11 pts were pretreated with either splenectomy (n=6), interferon alpha (n=9) or deoxycoformycin (dCF) (n=3) or all procedures in sequence. Two pts treated with dCF did not respond to dCF, but only 2-CdA. The median time to the start of 2-CdA treatment of the 11 pretreated pts was 47 months (mo) (10-160). Out of 44, 43 (98%) achieved complete response (CR) (13 pts with residual disease-RD), one pt reached a good partial response with a single cycle of 2-CdA. Out of 44 pts, 13 had no nonhematologic toxicities at all. Toxicities (WHO grade I-IV) were mainly of grade I and II, in one pt grade IV infectious complication. Bone marrow biopsies were performed at the time of recovery of hematopoiesis, thereafter at 2-3 mo intervals, thereafter at 6 mo, and finally annually in 35 pts. The median follow-up is 8.5 years (0.1-12.2). Disease-free survival from the start of 2-CdA treatment is 36% at 12 years (median 8.4 years), 17/44 pts relapsed. Nine of these pts were treated with 2-CdA again, eight achieved a second CR (median 2.5 yrs), one pt did not respond. Eight of our cohort had a second malignancy before receiving 2-CdA. Six pts died in CR due to the second malignancy. The overall survival at 12 years after the start of 2-CdA treatment is 79%. 2-CdA is a safe and effective treatment of HCL inducing complete remissions in the majority of pts with only a single cycle of 2-CdA, and a paucity of toxicities. Responses are durable and long-lasting. Pts who relapsed following treatment with 2-CdA responded to subsequent retreatment with 2-CdA.",M1
15183121,"Activation of deoxycytidine kinase by protein kinase inhibitors and okadaic acid in leukemic cells.Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is a key enzyme in the deoxynucleoside salvage pathway and in the activation of numerous nucleoside analogues used in cancer and antiviral chemotherapy. Recent studies indicate that dCK activity might be regulated through reversible phosphorylation. Here, we report the effects of a large panel of protein kinase inhibitors on dCK activity in the B-leukemia cell line EHEB, both in basal conditions and in the presence of the nucleoside analogue 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CdA</e>) which induces activation of dCK. Except staurosporine and H-7 that significantly reduced the activation of dCK by CdA, no specific protein kinase inhibitor diminished basal dCK activity or its activation by CdA. In contrast, genistein, a general protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and AG-490, an inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK3, increased basal dCK activity more than two-fold. Two specific inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway, PD-98059 and U-0126, also enhanced dCK activity. These data suggest that the JAK/MAPK pathway could be involved in the regulation of dCK. Moreover, we show that the activity of dCK, raised by CdA, can return to its initial level by treatment with protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A). Accordingly, dCK activity in intact cells increased upon incubation with okadaic acid (OA) at concentrations that should inhibit PP2A, but not protein phosphatase-1. Activation of dCK by protein kinase inhibitors and OA was also observed in CCRF-CEM cells and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-lymphocytes, suggesting a general mechanism of post-translational regulation of dCK, which could be exploited to enhance the activation of antileukemic nucleoside analogues.",M1
15170896,"Efficacy of continuous infusion 2-<e>CDA</e> (cladribine) in pediatric patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) may behave differently depending on what sites are involved and the response or lack of response to earlier therapies. Therapy for high-risk patients or those with multiple reactivations continues to be challenging because of variable response rates and frequent toxicities. The goals of this study were to determine the long-term disease free survival in children with high-risk or multiply reactivated LCH treated with 2-CDA, and the toxicity of low dose continuous infusion (CI). Ten children with multiple reactivations or high-risk disease as defined by the Histiocyte Society were treated with CI 2-CDA and were evaluable for response and toxicity assessment. The starting dose of 2-CDA was 5 mg/M(2)/day for 3 days and escalated to 6.5 mg/M(2)/day for 3 days if tolerated. The maximum number of courses of 2-CDA per patient was limited to six. Fifty-two courses of 2-CDA were administered without difficulty. After the patient demonstrated no acute toxicity with the first administration of 2-CDA, the subsequent doses were given at home to all but one patient. All 10 patients had a clinical response, 9 documented by radiographic, or changes in physical exam or review of systems. Toxicity was limited to myelosuppression. Seven of the 10 patients required no additional therapy and remain disease free a median of 50 months from completing therapy. The three remaining patients are currently disease free after receiving other therapy. Further studies are needed to determine the role of 2-CDA in this patient population. 2-CDA can be given safely using home therapy, and may effective even in high-risk patients.",M1
15147742,"Influence of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine) on human erythrocytes.2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>, cladribine) is one of the newest chemotherapy drugs which has been around and in use for a few years. Drug in tumour cells causes the inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair processes in replication cells, and the accumulation of DNA strand breaks in nonproliferating cells. The present study was undertaken to characterize the influence of cladribine on the fluidity of the lipid bilayer and protein conformation in human erythrocytes. The effect of cladribine on the erythrocyte membrane structure was examined by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements. It was observed that under the studied conditions (c: 0.1-5 microg/ml, t = 1 h, 37 degrees C), cladribine localised mainly in the erythrocyte membrane and affected its organization. The alterations in the fluidity were observed mainly in the deeper regions of the cell membrane. The incorporation of drug into human erythrocytes also caused negligible conformational alterations of membrane cytoskeletal proteins and did not change the internal viscosity of the cells. We can conclude from these data that 2-CdA in vitro is significantly much less toxic to erythrocytes than anthracycline drugs, which are used in treatment of leukemias. However, the higher concentrations of 2-CdA (about 5 microg/ml) can be also toxic to erythrocytes.",M1

A complete separation of CdA and its metabolites was achieved in 30 min. The minimum amount of CdAMP that could be detected was 1 pmol. The assay was linear with reaction times up to at least 3h. With respect to the protein concentration, the reaction was linear with protein concentrations up to 760 microg/ml in the assay. An amount of 8 x 10(3) cells was already sufficient to determine the specific dCK activity in SK-N-BE(2)c cells. CdA was not only converted to CdAMP but also to 2-chloroadenine and, surprisingly, also to 2-chlorodeoxyinosine, in MOLT-3 cells. The deamination of CdA was completely inhibited by deoxycoformycin, which clearly demonstrates that CdA is a substrate for adenosine deaminase.",M1

Fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<e>CdA</e>) are active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) both as salvage therapy and in newly diagnosed patients. These agents have revolutionized therapeutic strategies for patients with CLL that had remained unchanged for many years and included alkylating agents-based therapy with no potential for long-term remission or cure. Purine analogues have also been successfully combined with a variety of other chemotherapeutic drugs such as mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies, specifically Rituximab and CAMPATH-1H. These agents are immunosuppressive and have been associated with opportunistic infections, the incidence of which can be significantly reduced by early recognition and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. In this review, the activity and toxicity of 2-CdA, fludarabine, and pentostatin in CLL as single agents and in combination with conventional chemotherapy are discussed. These drugs are increasingly used as initial therapy in CLL. Such strategies are associated with higher remission rates than have been previously achieved and in some cases, molecular remission, suggesting an important step towards cure.",M1

However, the addition of immunosuppressive and DNA-targeting agents might increase purine analog-related complications. The risk for serious complications was evaluated in 38 patients treated with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (<e>CDA</e>) and cyclophosphamide (CP). The diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 15, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia in 4, mantle cell lymphoma in 6, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in 10, and other low-grade NHL in 3 patients. All patients were pretreated (median: 2 lines, range: 1-5) and 23 (61%) were refractory. The patients received a median of two courses (range: 1-5) of 5.6 mg/m(2) CDA, followed by a median of 200 mg/m(2) CP, for 3 days. The response rate was 51% [complete remission (CR): 14%, partial remission (PR): 38%]. Grade 3/4 infections occurred in 16 (42%) patients. Dose-limiting cytopenias were seen in 22 (58%) patients. In 12 (32%) patients, autoimmune manifestations developed requiring treatment in most of them. Second cancers arose in five (13%) patients (myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelocytic leukemia in three, lung cancer in two). Multivariate analysis showed that cytopenias, gender (F), prior radiotherapy, and age (&gt;65 years) predicted for the complications seen after CDA-CP.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed our HCL patients treated with front-line 2-CdA (by 2-hour infusion) either for 5 consecutive days at 0.14 mg/kg/day (daily subset, n=21) or once a week at 0.14 mg/kg for 5 cycles (weekly subset, n=16). RESULTS: Of the 37 eligible patients, 30 (81%) achieved complete response (CR) and 7 (19%) partial response (PR) (overall response rate, 100%); identical response rates were recorded in the daily and weekly subsets. After a median follow-up of 122 months (range, 54-156), the overall relapse rate was 27% (8/30): 24% (4/17) had relapsed in the subset treated daily whereas 30% (4/13) had done so in the subset treated weekly (p=ns). The projected 13-year overall and the relapse-free survivals are 96% and 52%, respectively. In terms of hematologic toxicity, the weekly 2-CdA schedule was associated with significantly fewer cases of grade 3-4 neutropenia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In HCL patients, a single dose of 2-CdA induces a long-term CR. Over 90% of patients are alive 13 years later and over 50% of patients appear to be clinically cured by this treatment. The weekly schedule seems to be a safer option for neutropenic HCL patients, while apparently providing equivalent results in terms of response rates and long-term outcome.",M1

H9-araC cells obtained by cultivation of H9 cells in the presence of 0.5 microM arabinosyl-cytosine (araC) had lower deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase (TK) activities and expressed cross-resistance to araC and AZT. The IC(50) values of AZT and CdA were calculated by using median-effect analysis and CalcuSyn software. The IC(50) values were 0.44 and 0.82 microM for CdA and 67.8 and 30,310 microM for AZT in H9 and H9-araC cells, respectively. However, when the drugs were used in combination the IC(50) values of CdA and AZT were reduced to 0.12 and 15.5 microM in H9 cells and to 0.19 and 24.9 microM in H9-araC cells, respectively. Calculation of dose reduction index (DRI) indicated that at 50-90% growth inhibition level, the combination of the drugs caused 3.6-5.8- and 4.1-11.5-fold reduction in the dose of CdA and 4.4-37.6- and &gt; 1000-fold reduction in the dose of AZT in H9 and H9-araC cells, respectively. The combination index (CI) values simulated from these data suggested synergistic to very strong synergistic lymphocytotoxic effects of AZT combined with CdA. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of a double-targeted approach for designing efficacious therapeutics for the kinase deficient drug resistant tumors.",M1

Median hospitalization time during the induction was 7 days shorter for DAC-7 compared to the DA-7 group (33 vs 40 days, P=0.002). Toxicity was comparable in both groups. The probability of 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) for DAC-7 and DA-7 group equaled 43 and 34%, respectively (P=NS). There was a trend toward higher LFS rate for patients aged &gt;40 years receiving DAC-7 compared with DA-7 regimen (44 vs 28%, P=0.05). This study proves that addition of 2-CdA increases antileukemic potency of DNR+AraC regimen, thus resulting in a higher CR rate after one induction cycle when compared to DA-7, without additional toxicity. It shortens hospitalization time and may improve long-term survival in patients aged &gt;40 years.",M1
14746857,"Second malignancies and Richter's syndrome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with cladribine.The increased frequency of second malignancies in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is well known. Moreover, antineoplastic therapy additionally increases the risk of secondary cancers. In this study, we analysed whether treatment with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-<e>CdA</e>) during the course of CLL had an impact on the subsequent occurrence of either secondary solid tumours or Richter's syndrome. There were 1487 eligible patients, 251 treated with 2-CdA alone, 913 treated with alkylating agents (AA)-based regimens alone and 323 treated with both 2-CdA and AA. Median time from the start of CLL treatment to the diagnosis of secondary malignancy was 1.9 years (0.5-5.1 years) for the 2-CdA group, 1.8 years (0.3-7.9 years) for the AA group and 3.9 years (0.3-8.4 years) for the 2-CdA+AA group. A total of 68 malignancies were reported in 65 patients. Ten events were non-melanotic skin cancers and were excluded from the analysis, leaving 58 events in 58 patients. In the group of patients treated with 2-CdA alone, there were 15 (6.0%) cases, in the group of patients treated with AA alone there were 26 (2.8%) cases, and in the group treated with 2-CdA+AA there were 17 (5.3%) cases of secondary malignancies. The differences between the frequency of secondary malignancies in the 2-CdA and 2-CdA+AA versus AA alone groups were not significant (P=0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). Only lung cancers occurred significantly more frequently in the 2-CdA (2.8%) and 2-CdA+AA (2.2%) treated groups compared with the AA patients (0.3%) (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). In conclusion, 2-CdA in CLL patients does not seem to increase the risk of secondary malignancies except for lung cancers. However, further studies are necessary to establish the real risk of lung cancer in CLL patients treated with 2-CdA.",M1
14690166,"2-Chloro-deoxyadenosine induces durable complete remission in Castleman's disease but may accelerate its transformation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.There is currently no consensus on the best treatment for unresectable hyaline-vascular variant or for multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), because none of the reported regimens have consistently produced complete response or durable remission in the majority of patients In the present study, we report on the use of 2-<e>CdA</e> (2-chloro-deoxyadenosine) in three patients, two of them with MCD and one with unresectable hyaline-vascular type disease. Relapse-free survival of the responding patients was 24 and 20 months. Later, both patients evolved to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell NHL, respectively). 2-CdA typically causes a long-lasting state of immunodeficiency and the profound influence of this drug on the immune system has raised questions concerning the emergence of secondary neoplasms after its use. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that: 1) 2-CdA can induce durable complete remission in MCD patients but unfortunately it cannot cure the disease; 2) the possibility that 2-CdA may accelerate the transformation of MCD to NHL cannot be ruled out.",M1

14565659,"The influence of imatinib mesylate (STI571) used alone or in combination with purine nucleoside analogues on the normal and chronic myelogenous leukaemia progenitor cells in vitro.Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Glivec), a signal transduction inhibitor used as a single agent demonstrates significant activity in patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Nevertheless, the interaction between STI571 and other antileukaemic drugs such as hydroxyurea, interferon alpha or cytarabine have also been investigated in order to further improve its effectiveness. In this study we have tried to answer the question if the combination of STI571 with purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs)- cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>) and fludarabine (F-ara-A) intensifies the antiproliferative effect on granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) from patients with CML as well as from normal persons. Our studies were based on the method of semisolid CFU-GM cultures in vitro. We added STI571 or PNAs singly to the culture, each of the drugs at three concentrations, as well as in combinations of the concentrations used. We showed that STI571 (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microM) used alone inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared to CFU-GM derived from normal donors (p = 0.03; p = 0.0004; p = 0.0001). We also observed that STI571 used together with 2-CdA (5,10 and 20 microM) or F-ara-A (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 microM) at all the combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared either to the control or to STI571 used alone (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the differences between CML and normal CFU-GM colony growth inhibition after the use of the combination of the highest concentrations of STI571 either with 2-CdA or F-ara-A were statistically significant (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, STI571 used together with both the PNAs had an additive effect on CML CFU-GM cells. However, further experimental and clinical studies concerning the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of CML patients seem warranted.",M1
12953133,"Immune reconstitution following reduced-intensity transplantation with cladribine, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin: serial comparison with conventional myeloablative transplantation.The primary object of the conditioning regimen for allogeneic reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) is immunosuppression to achieve stable engraftment of donor cells, rather than bone marrow ablation. Therefore, immune reconstitution after RIST might be different from that after conventional stem cell transplantation (CST). In this study, 22 patients underwent RIST and 28 underwent CST. The RIST regimen consisted of cladribine (2-<e>CdA</e>; 0.11 mg/kg/day for 6 days), BU (4 mg/kg/day for 2 days), and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2-4 days). The CST group received either the BU (4 mg/kg/day x 4 days)/CY (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days) (n=13) or CY (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days)/TBI (4 Gy/day x 3 days) regimen (n=15). All patients underwent transplantation with G-CSF-mobilized blood stem cells. Engraftment speed after RIST was fast and seven of 22 patients did not require platelet transfusion. We noted that the numbers of CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+, and CD4+CD45RO+ T cells after transplant in the RIST group were significantly lower than those in the CST group (P=0.0001 for both the comparisons). However, the reconstitution of CD20+ B cells was faster in the RIST group (P=0.0001). The response of T cells to PHA stimulation was lower in the RIST group (P=0.0001 on day 30 and P=0.02 on day 90). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in the incidence of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections between the two groups. We concluded that our RIST regimen might delay laboratory-evaluated T-cell immune reconstitution compared to CST; however, the observed setbacks did not directly translate into clinically significant increases in infectious episodes.",M1

Cutaneous reactions have occasionally been reported with this drug, particularly if used with allopurinol. We report a high frequency of skin reactions in 15 consecutive patients with hairy cell leukaemia treated with 17 courses of 2-CdA.

METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C2 g/m2, and G-CSF. In the case of partial remission (PR), a second CLAG was administered. Patients in complete remission (CR) received two consolidation courses based on HD Ara-C, mitoxantrone or idarubicine, with or without 2-CdA. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients from 11 centers were registered; 50 primary resistant and eight early relapsed (CR1 &lt; 6 months). CR was achieved in 29 (50%) patients, 19 (33%) were refractory, and 10 (17%) died early. Forty of 50 primary resistant patients received daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C as the first-line induction therapy (DA-7), 10 received additional 2-CdA (DAC-7). The CR rates after CLAG were 58% and 10%, respectively in each group (P = 0.015). Five of six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML achieved CR. Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The overall survival (OS, 1 yr) for the 58 patients as a whole, and the 29 patients in CR were 42% and 65%, respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS, 1 yr) was 29%. Only first-line induction treatment with DA-7 significantly influenced the probability of CR after CLAG. None of the analyzed factors significantly influenced DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: CLAG regimen has significant anti-leukemic activity and an acceptable toxicity in refractory AML. The addition of 2-CdA to the first-line induction treatment may worsen the results of salvage with CLAG. The high CR rate in patients with MDS preceding AML deserves further observation.",M1

Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-<e>CdA</e>), a purine analog resistant to degradation by adenosine deaminase, has shown definitive clinical activity against various lymphoid malignancies, including hairy cell leukemia, indolent lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. An in vitro study showed the sensitivity of T-lymphoblastoid cell lines to cladribine, and a preceding Japanese phase I study of cladribine showed that 1 refractory patient with ATL achieved an objective response. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of cladribine in treating ATL, we conducted a multicenter phase II study. The plan was to administer cladribine to 30 ATL patients as 0.09 mg/kg per day by 7-day continuous intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses. Before the planned interim analysis, 16 patients with relapsed or refractory ATL were enrolled, 15 of whom were eligible. Only 1 of the 15 eligible patients showed an objective response (overall response rate, 7%; 90% confidence interval, 0% to 28%), and 11 patients (73%) showed progressive disease, mostly during the first course of treatment. Because the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval of the overall response rate did not reach 30% in the interim analysis, the Independent Monitoring Committee advised us to discontinue patient enrollment. In conclusion, cladribine is not worthy of further investigation for the treatment of ATL.",M1

19561605,"Mutations affecting the secretory COPII coat component SEC23B cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II.Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (<e>CDAs</e>) are phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous diseases. CDA type II (CDAII) is the most frequent CDA. It is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and by the presence of bi- and multinucleated erythroblasts in bone marrow, with nuclei of equal size and DNA content, suggesting a cytokinesis disturbance. Other features of the peripheral red blood cells are protein and lipid dysglycosylation and endoplasmic reticulum double-membrane remnants. Development of other hematopoietic lineages is normal. Individuals with CDAII show progressive splenomegaly, gallstones and iron overload potentially with liver cirrhosis or cardiac failure. Here we show that the gene encoding the secretory COPII component SEC23B is mutated in CDAII. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of SEC23B expression recapitulates the cytokinesis defect. Knockdown of zebrafish sec23b also leads to aberrant erythrocyte development. Our results provide in vivo evidence for SEC23B selectivity in erythroid differentiation and show that SEC23A and SEC23B, although highly related paralogous secretory COPII components, are nonredundant in erythrocyte maturation.",M2

In addition, GDF15 correlated significantly with several erythropoietic and iron parameters including Hepcidin-25, Ferritin, and Hepcidin-25/Ferritin ratios. These novel results suggest that CDA I patients express very high levels of serum GDF15, and that GDF15 contributes to the inappropriate suppression of hepcidin with subsequent secondary hemochromatosis.",M2

Moderate to severe maternal anemia is a recognized independent risk factor for low birth weight (LBW) and complicated delivery. The aim of the study was to review the outcome of pregnancies in women with CDA I. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory records of 28 spontaneous pregnancies in six Bedouin women with CDA I were reviewed. The results were compared with findings from a retrospective review of a large population-based registry including all pregnancies in Bedouin women during the same 15-yr period. RESULTS: Eighteen pregnancies in women with CDA I (64%) were complicated. One pregnancy was aborted spontaneously in the first trimester and one resulted in a non-viable fetus (stillborn at 26 wk). Cesarean section (CS) was performed in 10 pregnancies (36%). Eleven of the 26 newborns (42%) had a LBW: six were born prematurely and five were small for gestational age. The odds ratio for CS in women with CDA I compared with healthy Bedouin women was 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-10.3], and for a LBW infant, 5.5 (95% CI 2.4-12.3). Careful follow-up was associated with significantly better fetal outcome (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancies in women with CDA I are at high risk for delivery-related and outcome complications. To improve fetal outcome, women with CDA I should be carefully monitored during pregnancy.",M2
18166993,"Characterization of the N-glycosylation phenotype of erythrocyte membrane proteins in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (<e>CDA</e> II/HEMPAS).Congenital dyserythropoetic anemia type II (CDA II) is characterized by bi- and multinucleated erythroblasts and an impaired N-glycosylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Several enzyme defects have been proposed to cause CDA II based on the investigation of erythrocyte membrane glycans pinpointing to defects of early Golgi processing steps. Hitherto no molecular defect could be elucidated. In the present study, N-glycosylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins of CDA II patients and controls was investigated by SDS-Page, lectin binding studies, and MALDI-TOF/MS mapping in order to allow an embracing view on the glycosylation defect in CDA II. Decreased binding of tomato lectin was a consistent finding in all typical CDA II patients. New insights into tomato lectin binding properties were found indicating that branched polylactosamines are the main target. The binding of Aleuria aurantia, a lectin preferentially binding to alpha1-6 core-fucose, was reduced in western blots of CDA II erythrocyte membranes. MALDI-TOF analysis of band 3 derived N-glycans revealed a broad spectrum of truncated structures showing the presence of high mannose and hybrid glycans and mainly a strong decrease of large N-glycans suggesting impairment of cis, medial and trans Golgi processing. CONCLUSION: Truncation of N-glycans is a consistent finding in CDA II erythrocytes indicating the diagnostic value of tomato-lectin studies. However, structural data of erythrocyte N-glycans implicate that CDA II is not a distinct glycosylation disorder but caused by a defect disturbing Golgi processing in erythroblasts.",M2

The results indicated that the erythropoietic/granulopoietic ratio was markedly increased with megaloblastic morphology in all stage of erythrocyte. Most proerythroblast showed of irregular nuclei, while the Swiss-cheese-appearance of the heterochromatin was usually found in basophilic and polychromatic erythroblast. About half of orthochromatic erythroblast illustrated karyolysis and karyorrhexis. Some orthochromatic erythroblast exhibited karyolysis and plasmolysis simultaneously. The inter-nuclear chromatin bridge between separated erythroblasts was seldom found by TEM. The nuclear membrane and rough endoplasmic reticulum were destructed at all stage of erythrocytes in different degree.

In both patients 400 ml of blood were withdrawn every month. During three years 12 200 ml of blood were removed. The serum ferritin levels decreased from 1450,4 microg/L and 1131,7 microg/L to 447 microg/L and 457 microg/l, respectively. The transferrin saturation dropped from 0,99 at the start of the therapy to 0,64 and 0,86, respectively. The values of Hb, Hct, erythrocyte counts and MCV did not change as well as did not change reticulocyte counts, reticulocyte index, and RDW. Both patients tolerated repeated phlebotomies well. The decrease of bilirubin and normal values of haptoglobin might be the concequence of diminished destruction of erythrocytes and their precursors. Our observation confirms that phlebotomies can be used with success in CDA patients with mild anemia as treatment modality of iron overload.",M2

However, acquired dysplastic anaemia which mimic congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (<e>CDA</e>) type II morphology in the bone marrow is very rare. A 41-year-old Chinese man presented with refractory symptomatic anaemia in September 2001. He was clinically pale with no other significant physical finding. His initial peripheral blood picture showed normochromic normocytic anaemia with haemoglobin level of 26g/L, with no evidence of haemolysis and a poor reticulocyte response of 0.6%. Bone marrow aspiration was done and showed congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA) type II-like morphology. He was treated symptomatically with regular blood transfusions approximately every 3 weeks, until August 2002 when he developed multiple cervical lymphadenopathy with loss of appetite, loss of weight and low grade fever. Biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma. Staging with computed tomography and bone marrow aspirate revealed the infiltration of lymphoma cells into the marrow cavity consistent with the staging of IVB.

Complex bone disease has only occasionally been associated with this disease. CDA I is caused by mutations in the CDAN1 gene encoding for codanin-1. Our aim was to characterise the CDAN1 mutation in eight unrelated patients with sporadic CDA I, three of whom had complex bone disease. Six novel mutations in the CDAN1 gene were identified. In two patients, one mutation and in another, both mutations were elusive. No patient was homozygous for a null-type mutation. However, one patient with complex bone disease was homozygous for a splice-site mutation (IVS-12+5G&gt;A). Western blotting revealed that codanin-1 synthesis was 65% less than the control. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously unreported in the literature or the SNP database were also identified. Although the absence of codanin-1 is probably lethal, the presence of 35% of the protein was compatible with life but was associated with severe clinical manifestations.

The 12 patients included belong to the retrospective French Multicenter Study. Clinical and biologic data were compiled. Biologic tests included light and, in some cases, electron microscopy, ektacytometry, and red cell membrane protein electrophoresis.

CDA I was initially misdiagnosed in four children. By the time of diagnosis, anemia with reticulocytosis lower than expected in a hemolytic anemia was present in all patients. Bone marrow electron microscopy examination revealed characteristic findings in all nine children. Red cell membrane protein 4.1 was reduced in all five children. At least one transfusion was required in 11 of the 12 children. Interferon alpha2 corrected anemia in the three children who received monthly transfusions. CDA I is commonly misdiagnosed in children.

In a previous study, the authors found that the majority of their 31 Bedouin patients had anemia and jaundice during the first month of life and required blood transfusions; some had persistent pulmonary hypertension. In the present retrospective evaluation of 70 Bedouin patients with CDA type I, the authors more than doubled the number. Forty-five (64%) patients were symptomatic in the neonatal period, 29 (65%) had hepatomegaly, 24 (53%) had early jaundice, 11 (27%) were born small for gestational age, 7 (15%) had persistent pulmonary hypertension, and 6 (13%) had direct hyperbilirubinemia and another 6 (13%) had transient thrombocytopenia.

Here, in a 9-yr follow-up of a single patient, we show that interferon remains active during such a long period. The optimal dose of conventional alpha interferon could be evaluated at 2 million units twice a week. Pegylated interferon could be used as well at a dose of 30 microg/wk. During interferon treatment, serum and erythrocyte ferritin levels decreased progressively, and remained inversely correlated with haemoglobin levels. On repeated liver biopsies, iron overload could be normalized. Low dose interferon is a long-term treatment of CDA-I, and allows a significant decrease in iron overload, that could be interesting even in patients who are only moderately anaemic.",M2

The activities of erythrocyte enzymes were measured according to the methods recommended by international committee for standardization in hematology (ICSH). The quantity and quality of erythrocyte membrane proteins were analyzed with 4% - 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The membrane ultrastructure of erythrocyte from bone marrow was observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM). RESULTS: The main results were: (1) Bone marrow morphology revealed erythroid hyperplasia and 0.10 symmetrically binucleated late erythroblasts. The erythrocytes in peripheral blood showed anisocytosis and hypochromia. (2) The intracellular iron was 0.98 and the storage iron was strongly positive in bone marrow. The serum ferritin was 1607 micro g/L. The content of blood sugar was 27.5 mmol/L. (3) Ham test was negative in his own acidified serum but positive in the group-compatible sera. (4) A quick mobile H band was seen in hemoglobin electrophoresis. H inclusion test was positive. (5) SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the migration of band 3 protein of erythrocyte membrane in an electric field was faster (110%) than that of normal controls and the relative contents of band 1, band 3, band 4.1 were reduced to various extent.

The qualitative and quantitative defects of erythropoiesis in CDA II, as estimated by the hematological and biochemical parameters at the time of diagnosis, may not reflect the heterogeneity of the disease course of each patient. METHODS: Three pediatric patients with CDA II are herein presented, having an heterogeneous clinical course. In addition to bone marrow morphology, Ham test and SDS-PAGE of erythrocyte membrane protein, the present study also examined erythroid marrow activity, by measuring serum Erythropoietin (Epo), soluble Transferrin Receptors (sTfR) concentrations and Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI). RESULTS: All patients demonstrated the same pattern of ineffective erythropoiesis, having increased Epo (350-389 IU/L), sTfR concentrations (6.2-7.8 mg/L) and low RPI values (0.8-1.3). Erythron expansion was expressed by RPI values nearly twofold higher than normal values in parallel to raised sTfR and high Epo production. Despite the same degree of ineffective erythropoiesis seen in all patients, the severity of the clinical course was diverse in terms of frequency and clinical relevance of transfusion needs. CONCLUSION: An analysis of the parameters expressing ineffective erythropoiesis in CDA II can provide a better understanding of the degree of dyserythropoiesis, however it is not useful for predicting the clinical course of disease in patients, because the underlying genetic heterogeneity of this disorder remains obscure.",M2

Little is known about sleep function and daytime sleepiness in children with chronic anemia such as beta-thalassemia or congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type 1 (<e>CDA</e>-1). OBJECTIVES: To investigate if children and adolescents who have beta-thalassemia (major or intermedia) or CDA-1 experience sleep fragmentation and objective daytime sleepiness and also to investigate if children and adolescents with beta-thalassemia have obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: Ten patients (7 males and 3 females) with beta-thalassemia (mean [SD] age, 10.4 [7.3] years), 10 patients (7 males and 3 females) with CDA-1 (mean [SD] age, 13.5 [5.1] years), and 13 healthy volunteer control children(7 males and 6 females) (mean [SD] age, 10 [4] years) underwent nocturnal polysomnographic studies. A multiple sleep latency test was performed for 6 patients who had beta-thalassemia and 8 patients who had CDA-1. RESULTS: Both patient groups, that is, those who had beta-thalassemia and those who had CDA-1, had multiple arousals during sleep (mean [SD], 27.8 [11.4] events per hour and 23.8 [11.8] events per hour, respectively) compared with the control subjects (12.1 [6.6] events per hour) (P&lt;.002). Thirty-eight percent (10.6 events per hour) of the arousals in patients with beta-thalassemia and 25% (6.0 events per hour) of the arousals in patients with CDA-1 were induced by periodic limb movements during sleep. In the control group, most (98%) arousals were spontaneous and unrelated to any definable event. The multiple sleep latency test average was 7.8 minutes for patients with beta-thalassemia (n = 6) and 10.7 minutes for patients with CDA-1 (n = 8). Five patients with beta-thalassemia and 4 patients with CDA-1 underwent a second polysomnographic study on the next night to confirm reproducibility. There was no significant change in the total number or index of arousals and no difference in the severity of the periodic limb movements during sleep compared with the results of the first polysomnographic study. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with beta-thalassemia or CDA-1 have evidence of impaired sleep function that is partially due to periodic limb movements during sleep and arousals that result in objective diurnal sleepiness.",M2

In order to explain the patient's cell membrane distortions and the high affinity for the various intracellular inclusions, we studied its composition and structure in comparison to other anemic and non-anemic cases. Red cells from peripheral blood were fractionated into cellular, membrane and protein extracts. Membrane attached immunocomplexes were separated and collected by immunoprecipitation. The subcellular fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted against a variety of erythroid-specific antibodies. The protein composition of the membrane was characterized by immunogold electron microscopy. In the membrane of the <e>CDA</e>-associated case, we identified sialic acid and protein deficiencies, formation of protein crosslinkings, excesses of bound globin and immunoglobulins and aberrant peptides. In contrast to the typical hemoglobin-H disease, the ghost-bound globin exhibited preferential attachment to the skeletal proteins than the band 3 and the skeleton-bound globin consisted not only of beta- but also of alpha-globin chains. Another hallmark, probably associated with the CDA defect, was the participation of glycophorins in the membrane-bound immunocomplexes and the pathological clustering of the latter in the membrane. This study strongly suggests that the result of the combinatorial effects on the diseased membrane created a unique profile, quite distinct from the one observed in several typical hemoglobinopathies. Our observations shed light into critical membrane alterations leading to hemolysis in the novel CDA-associated disease and probably into the CDA-I or CDA-I-like diseases.",M2

On the other hand, hemoglobin H (HbH) disease is a severe form of alpha-thalassemia. We herein present ultrastructural and immunocytochemical data concerning the first reported case of congenital anemia with clinical and molecular diagnosis of HbH disease complicated by CDA-I-specific dysplasies of the erythroid cells. Fine structure and transmission electron microscope immunolabeling analysis of the bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were consistent with a potential co-existence of the two defects in the same patient, producing a novel and diagnostically important dyserythropoietic profile. In the patient under investigation both nuclear and plasma membrane of the erythroid cells are almost equally defective. The unknown defect causes the concomitant precipitation of beta- and alpha-globin chains (or hemoglobin), along with an unidentified protein(s). The unusual inclusions gain access to the euchromatin area and exhibit higher affinity for the plasma membrane than the classic inclusions of precipitated alpha- or beta-globin chains seen in thalassemia. The affected erythroid precursors are presented with severe nuclear distortions, endonuclear globin loads, morphological evidence of apoptosis and increased erythrophagocytosis. Plasma membrane distortions and the rate of protein precipitation were aggravated with differentiation. Our findings provide additional evidence for a specific activation of a beta-thalassemic-like mechanism in CDA-I, containing not only the hemoglobin biosynthesis as previously suggested, and interpret the prototypal hematological portrait, which is an HbH disease, modified and partially counterbalanced by the effect of CDA-I or an unidentified CDA-I-like disease.

CDA type I (CDAI [MIM 224120], gene symbol CDAN1) is characterized by erythroid pathological features such as internuclear chromatin bridges, spongy heterochromatin, and invagination of the nuclear membrane, carrying cytoplasmic organelles into the nucleus. A cluster of 45 highly inbred Israeli Bedouin with CDAI enabled the mapping of the CDAN1 disease gene to a 2-Mb interval, now refined to 1.2 Mb, containing 15 candidate genes on human chromosome 15q15 (Tamary et al. 1998). After the characterization and exclusion of 13 of these genes, we identified the CDAN1 gene through 12 different mutations in 9 families with CDAI. This 28-exon gene, which is transcribed ubiquitously into 4738 nt mRNA, was reconstructed on the basis of gene prediction and homology searches. It encodes codanin-1, a putative o-glycosylated protein of 1,226 amino acids, with no obvious transmembrane domains. Codanin-1 has a 150-residue amino-terminal domain with sequence similarity to collagens and two shorter segments that show weak similarities to the microtubule-associated proteins, MAP1B (neuraxin) and synapsin. These findings, and the cellular phenotype, suggest that codanin-1 may be involved in nuclear envelope integrity, conceivably related to microtubule attachments. The specific mechanisms by which codanin-1 underlies normal erythropoiesis remain to be elucidated.",M2

The association of CDA-II and GS caused early gallstone formation that led the patient to undergo cholecystectomy at the age of 15. GS is typified by increased production of both unconjugated and monoconjugated bilirubin, which is more lithogenic. The development of ulcers is not typical of CDA-II, even though they are associated with many of the hemolytic anemias, and were thought in our patient to be due to a thrombophilic tendency which manifest with Antithrombin III and Protein C deficiency.",M2

Repeated transfusions required since the age of 6 months to treat her CDA led to iron overload and a persistently high ferritin level. Her relapsing FMF made effective iron chelation therapy very difficult. Consequently, at the age of 4 years, she underwent allogeneic, sibling bone marrow transplantation (BMT). During conditioning for her BMT, symptoms of FMF, including splenomegaly, arthritis, and recurrent abdominal pain, began to resolve and she was gradually weaned off colchicine. Now, 2 years after the transplantation, she remains free from FMF symptomatology and is off all immunosuppressants. This case demonstrates that symptoms of FMF can be alleviated by the therapy used during allogeneic BMT. In this patient it is likely that the missing factor in FMF is now being provided by granulocytes derived from the stem cells within transplanted bone marrow.",M2

The red cell indices and the globin chain biosynthetic ratio were not characteristic of the defective haemoglobin genotype. The haematological, clinical and morphological data strongly suggest the novel coexistence of the two defects in a patient.

12068798,"Clinical and laboratory manifestations of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I in young adults.OBJECTIVES: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (<e>CDA</e>) type I is a rare autosomal recessive macrocytic anemia whose natural history is not well documented. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical picture of the disease in young adults. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 17 patients of mean age 11.9 +/- 5.4 yr (range 18-33 yr) and one older patient (age 44 yr), all Israeli Bedouins. The degree of anemia was evaluated as well as the extent of development of gallstones and iron overload. In each subject we determined the hemochromatosis gene mutations and the uridine dyphosphate-glucoronosyltransferase (UGT-1A) gene polymorphism associated with Gilbert's syndrome. RESULTS: The patients were found to have moderate anemia, with the women displaying lower mean hemoglobin levels than the men (8.2 +/- 0.9 g dL(-1) vs. 10 +/- 1.3 g dL(-1); P=0.0059). The majority of patients (59%) had received at least one blood transfusion, with the women having a significantly higher transfusion requirement. Although delayed puberty was noted, final height and weight were within normal limits, and eight patients had progeny. Biliary stones were found in three of 16 patients, two of whom were homozygous for UGT-1A gene polymorphism. None of the patients carried the common hemochromatosis gene mutation, although serum ferritin levels were moderately elevated (788 +/- 332 ng mL(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: CDA type I in young adults is characterized by moderate macrocytic anemia, more severe in women, and a tendency to cholelithiasis and secondary progressive iron overload. We suggest that iron overload in this patient population should be monitored and chelation therapy initiated when indicated to prevent organ damage",M2

No family history of blood diseases was obtained and no anemia was documented in the medical records of any of her four children. The bone marrow (BM) examination on light microscopy revealed a severe erythroid hyperplasia with the presence of giant multinucleated erythroblasts. Ultrastructural examination of the BM disclosed the presence of many large multinucleated erythroblasts bearing a variety of ultrastructural findings: nuclear clefts, autophagic vacuoles, iron-loaded mitochondria, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. In addition, extensive hyperlobulation of the nucleus and partial loss of nuclear membrane with  spilling  of nuclear material to the adjacent cytoplasm was also noted in some of the erythroblasts.

CDA type II, also known as hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with a positive acidified serum test (HEMPAS), is the most frequent one. A number of associations with CDA II have been reported, although each described only one or a few patients.

11836161,"Heterozygosity of CDAN II (HEMPAS) gene may be detected by the analysis of erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates from healthy carriers.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (<e>CDA</e>) type I, II, and III, is associated with abnormalities of erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates that are most pronounced in type II CDA or hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with a positive acidified-serum test (HEMPAS). The abnormalities consist in hypoglycosylation of polylactoaminoglycans linked to proteins (as in band 3 glycoprotein) and ceramides (known under the name of polyglycosylceramides) as well as in accumulation of some oligoglycosylceramides: lactotriaosylceramide, neolactotetraosylceramide, and sometimes globotetraosylceramide. Glycophorin A is partially unglycosylated with respect to O-linked glycans. Types I and II of the disease are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possibility that heterozygosity with respect to CDAN2 gene in healthy carriers could be detected by analysis of erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined a family which consisted of heterozygous parents and their two sons, one of whom was afflicted with CDA II (proband) while the other was healthy. In all family members the glycosylation status of band 3 glycoprotein, polyglycosylceramides and glycophorin A was evaluated from their carbohydrate molar composition. In addition we determined erythrocyte membrane contents of oligo- and polyglycosylceramides, and agglutinability of erythrocytes by anti-i antibody. RESULTS: We found that the heterozygous parents showed, but about 50% less pronounced, most of the typical abnormalities of erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates that were present in the proband. These abnormalities included: hypoglycosylation of band 3, accumulation and hypoglycosylation of polyglycosylceramides, and accumulation of lactotriaosylceramide. The level of neolactotetraosylceramide in the erythrocyte membranes of the parents was, however, normal. Globotetraosylceramide content was elevated in erythrocytes from the proband and, surprisingly, even more so in the parents. Glycophorin A in the proband was only slightly abnormal. Erythrocytes from both the parents and the proband expressed increased agglutinability with anti-i antibody. All glycoconjugates examined were normal in erythrocytes from the healthy son. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Individuals heterozygous with respect to CDAN2 gene can be identified through determination of the carbohydrate molar composition of band 3 and polyglycosylceramides as well as by an elevated erythrocyte content of polyglycosylceramides. In the parents these abnormalities show dosage effects. Determination of the carbohydrate molar composition of glycophorin A and of oligoglycosylceramides seems to be less promising. These findings indicate that the analysis of erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates may be a valuable addition to the repertoire of methods used in studies on the genetics of CDA.",M2

Report of a new family and a review.A new autosomal recessive syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (<e>CDA</e>) with microcytosis has recently been described in four children (two sibships) of one consangineous Arab family. In this report, we describe the clinical features and course of the syndrome of CRMO and CDA in two additional patients (one sibship) from another consanguineous Arab family and review the literature. The two patients (brother and sister), the products of a consanguineous marriage, developed the syndrome at an early age of 3 weeks and 2 months respectively. The diagnosis of CRMO was confirmed by radiological and technetium isotope bone scans. Bone marrow studies confirmed the diagnosis of CDA. Peripheral blood films showed hypochromia and microcytosis. The sites involved by CRMO were periarticular, mainly around the elbow, knee, wrist and small joints of the hand. The brother is now 21 years old and the sister 3.5 years old and CRMO is still active with frequent relapses. The brother developed flexion deformities at the age of 13 years. Both patients failed to thrive; weight and height were below the 5th percentile. CONCLUSION: This is the second report of the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and microcytic congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia, confirming it as a clinical entity, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The disease is characterised by an early onset, long clinical course of remissions and relapses, and seems to be different from the sporadic form of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis.",M2
11564084,"Glycoconjugate abnormalities in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I, II and III.Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II (<e>CDA</e> II) is well known for glycosylation abnormalities affecting erythrocyte membrane glycoconjugates that encompass hypoglycosylation of band 3 glycoprotein and accumulation of glycosphingolipids: lactotriaosylceramides, neolactotriaosylceramide and polyglycosylceramides. These abnormalities were not observed in erythrocytes from patients with CDA of either type I or III. Recently, however, we have described a CDA type I patient in Poland with identical, though less pronounced, glycoconjugate abnormalities to those observed in patients with CDA type II. The abnormalities included partial unglycosylation of O-linked glycosylation sites in glycophorin A. These abnormalities are now reported in three Bedouin patients from Israel with CDA type I. In addition, the erythrocyte membranes of these patients exhibited highly increased globotetraosylceramide content. Glycoconjugate abnormalities were also present in erythrocyte membranes from three patients from Northern Sweden with CDA type III but they almost exclusively affected glycosphingolipids. In erythrocytes of all patients examined including one with CDA type II, polyglycosylceramides were significantly hypoglycosylated although, on a molar basis, their contents in erythrocyte membranes were increased. Thus, glycoconjugate abnormalities of varying intensity occur in erythrocyte membranes from all patients with CDA that were investigated.",M2

The natural history of the disease is unknown. The frequency, the relevance of complications, and the use of splenectomy are poorly defined. This study examined 98 patients from unrelated families enrolled in the International Registry of CDA-II. Retrospective data were obtained using an appropriate questionnaire. The mean age at presentation was 5.2 +/- 6.1 years. Anemia was present in 66% and jaundice in 53.4% of cases. The mean age at correct diagnosis was 15.9 +/- 11.8 years. Twenty-three percent of patients for whom data were available developed anemia during the neonatal period, and 10 of these individuals required transfusions. Splenectomy produced an increased hemoglobin (P &lt;.001) and a reduced bilirubin level (P =.007) in comparison with values before splenectomy.

CDA II is frequently misdiagnosed as Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) due to the presence of mild chronic haemolytic anaemia with splenomegaly, increased osmotic fragility, and presence of microspherocytes. Accurate diagnosis of CDA II is important to prevent severe iron overload. Erythrocyte and reticulocyte indices were assessed in 10 patients from six families with CDA II, 18 patients from eight families with HS, and 50 normal controls. Characteristic increases in distribution width were present in CDA II for cell volume (RDW, anisocytosis) and in HS for cell haemoglobin concentration (HDW, anisochromia), resulting in an RDW/HDW ratio which was significantly greater in CDA than HS (P &lt; 0.0002). A cut-off value for RDW/HDW of 5.34 resulted in 89% sensitivity and 70% specificity in distinguishing CDA II from HS. Distribution width for cell haemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHDWr) was characteristically increased in CDA II, resulting in a CHDW/CHDWr ratio significantly lower in CDA II than HS (P &lt; 0.0002). A cut-off value of 0.98 provided 89% sensitivity and 80% specificity in distinguishing CDA II from HS. These differences in distribution widths of flow-cytometric parameters of reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes reflect the different pathogeneses of the two diseases and are helpful for the differential diagnosis of these two conditions.",M2

The modification involved a preliminary extraction of erythrocyte membranes with aqueous phenol, subsequent electrophoresis and analysis of the extracted glycophorins rather than electrophoresis and analysis of the glycophorin from intact erythrocyte membranes. The results showed a large deficit of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and sialic acid residues in glycophorin A from patients with CDA type I and type II amounting to about 45% and 55%, respectively. The results strongly suggest that glycophorin A in these patients is partly unglycosylated with respect to O-linked glycans. In addition, glycophorin A from erythrocytes of a patient with CDA II but not CDA I exhibited a significant deficit of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine suggesting that its N-glycosylation site was also partly unglycosylated.",M2

It is characterised by normocytic anaemia, variable jaundice and hepato-splenomegaly. Gallbladder disease and secondary haemochromatosis are frequent complications. We report a case characterised by severe transfusion-dependent anaemia. The proband inherited CDA-II in association with beta-thalassaemia trait. Splenectomy did not abolish the transfusion dependence and this, in association with poor compliance to iron-chelation therapy, prompted us to consider bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from his HLA-identical sibling. The preparative regimen included busulfan, thiotepa and fludarabine, and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A and short-term methotrexate. Engraftment of donor cells was prompt and the post-transplant course uncomplicated. The patient is alive and transfusion-independent 36 months after allograft. This is the first case of severe CDA-II to undergo BMT. Analysis of this pedigree suggests that interaction with beta-thalassaemia enhanced the clinical severity of CDA-II, making BMT an attractive therapy for patients with transfusion dependence.",M2

We show that the combined effect of an increased bilirubin load caused by dyserythropoiesis in CDA II and decreased bilirubin conjugation caused by reduced expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A) would increase the risk of hyperbilirubinemia (P &lt;.005) and gallstone formation (chi(2): P &lt;. 001). The rate of gallstone formation in patients with CDA II is 4. 75-fold the rate of patients without Gilbert's syndrome, and gallstone diagnosis occurs at a younger age (P &lt; 0.01).

We report on identical, although less pronounced, abnormalities in erythrocyte glycoconjugates from a patient with CDA-I.

10994542,"[Diagnosis and genetics of congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (<e>CDA</e>)]The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA) are hereditary diseases characterized by a lifelong, mostly moderate anemia. CDA can be diagnosed already in early childhood. However, diagnosis is complicated due to poor knowledge of morphological criteria and the large number of differential diagnoses that have to be excluded. CDA type I is characterized by macrocytic anemia with megaloblastic changes in erythropoiesis and chromatin bridges between isolated erythroblasts. Type II shows a normocytic anemia with a positive acidified serum test and increased agglutination with anti-i. Erythroblasts can present with 2 or more nuclei. CDA type III presents with a macrocytic anemia and erythroblasts with up to 12 nuclei, the so called gigantoblasts. Some patients lack the typical morphological abnormalities of type I-III (variants or type IV). Besides light microscopic abnormalities, CDA type-specific changes in electron microscopy are described. The clinical picture of the patients vary between the different forms: signs of hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis such as icterus, splenomegaly and gall stones can be present. Most important is the tendency of a part of patients to have an increased iron absorption and iron storage. Patients with and without transfusion dependency are described. Supportive care such as iron chelation can be necessary in some patients. The CDA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; in type III an additional autosomal dominant variant exists. Recently, the determination of gene loci for type I, II and III was enabled by linkage analysis on different regions of chromosome 15 and 22. It is considered that CDA I and II are genetically heterogenic. Until now no gene has been identified in either type of CDA. In CDA type II, a glycosylation defect of erythrocyte membrane proteins is present. An international group plans to do further research. Therefore, identification and registration of patients in a registry is necessary. Patients' data and material would enable gene characterization. The results would allow an extended classification according to genotype and prediction of the course of the disease. Additionally, information on the regulation and control of normal and abnormal erythropoiesis could be obtained.",M2

The clinical picture is characterized by hemolytic anemia and dramatic bone marrow changes dominated by active erythropoiesis with big multinucleated erythroblasts. The aim of this review is to describe the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and management CDA-III. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The present review critically examines relevant articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. The authors have performed several studies on CDA-III. STATE OF ART AND PERSPECTIVES: The clinical and laboratory manifestations of CDA-III indicate that the gene responsible for it, which has been mapped to chromosome 15q22, is expressed not only in erythroblasts during mitosis but also in B-cells, and in cells of the retina. Preliminary results indicate genetic and phenotypic similarities between a Swedish and an American family, both with an autosomally dominant inherited form of CDA-III. It is possible that the genetic lesion is identical in these families, but the different phenotypes and modes of inheritance reported among some other cases of CDA-III are probably the results of other genetic lesions. At present, the function of the gene responsible for the Swedish (V sterbotten) variant of CDA-III (CDAN3) is unknown and it is an important goal to characterize and clone this gene in order to study its function.",M2
10895259,"The congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias.Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (<e>CDA</e>) are a category of rare genetic diseases that affect erythropoiesis.

Their characterization is based on a careful examination of the bone marrow under light and electron microscopes. In addition, a number of rare or unique forms of dyserythropoiesis have been reported. At least with respect to CDA I to III, the clinical evaluation is reaching an ever increasing refinement: age of discovery, determinants of iron overload and/or biliary complications. Over the past few years, a more promising breakthrough has been the localization of the genes responsible for CDA I, II and III, that is, 15q15.1-q15.3, 20q11.2 and 15q21-q25, respectively.

Its exact prevalence is unknown. Based on a recently established International Registry of CDA-II (64 unrelated kindreds), a high frequency of CDA II families living in South Italy became evident. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to define the haplotypes of the CDA II kindreds living in Southern Italy based on markers D20S884, D20S863, RPN, D20S841 and D20S908. These markers map to 20q11.2, within the interval of the CDAN2 gene that is responsible for CDA II. Next, we looked at these markers in kindreds from other regions of Italy and from other countries, with special attention to families having ancestors in Southern Italy. RESULTS: Evaluation of the geographic distribution of the ancestry of Italian CDA-II patients clearly demonstrated the unusually high incidence of this condition in Southern Italy. Our statistical calculations and linkage disequilibrium data also clearly demonstrate a strong association of the markers of chromosome 20 with the disease locus in our sample. Almost all the regions defined by the markers here used is in disequilibrium with the disease. Combining the data from the Italian sample together with those obtained from the non-Italian ones, we can restrict the area of highest disequilibrium to that defined by markers D20S863-D20S908. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of this linkage disequilibrium the search for a common haplotype failed. This could suggest that the mutation was very old or that it occurred more than once on different genetic backgrounds.",M2

Laboratory examination showed anemia (Hb 7.1 g/dl) due to hemorrhagic gastric ulcer and positive Coombs' test without features of hemolysis. Initial bone marrow smears disclosed normal granulocytes and megakaryocytes, but only erythroid hyperplasia with multinuclearity and megaloblastosis was identified. Cytogenetic studies revealed normal karyotype. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (<e>CDA</e>) type II was initially suspected. Serologically, however, acid hemolysis and anti-I * i tests were negative as were the results of another Coombs' test. The second bone marrow aspiration disclosed a marked decrease in multinucleated erythroblasts together with an increase in those that had internuclear chromatin bridges. Electron microscopy of bone marrow specimens demonstrated morphological features of CDA types I and II, thus yielding a final diagnosis of elderly dyserythropoietic anemia, which is similar to both CDA types. It was suggested that the reactive secretion of erythropoietin due to bleeding played a role in these pathologic changes.",M2
10519996,"Suppression of <e>CDA</e> II expression in a homozygote.The CDAN2 gene, responsible for congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia, type II (CDA II), was recently mapped to 20q11.2. We report data on an additional member of a previously studied CDA II family. This member had always been regarded as haematologically normal. Unexpectedly, she had the same microsatellite assortments around the CDAN2 alleles as her three sisters with CDA II. In particular, she was a homozygote for microsatellites D20S863 and D20S841. This prompted an analysis of all facets of her phenotype. The Ham test was negative. The bone marrow smears contained a normal proportion of binucleate erythroblasts. Electron microscopy revealed the absence of extensive stretches of cisternae beneath and parallel to the inner surface of the erythroblast plasma membrane. Proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, which contaminate the reticulocyte plasma membrane in CDA II patients, were missing. Only the shape of the band 3 peak appeared slightly altered. This case exemplifies that homozygosity (or compound heterozygosity) for a deleterious gene may be silenced, or almost completely silenced. In recessively inherited diseases, suppressed phenotypes tend to be overlooked in siblings where both patients and unaffected individuals are expected.",M2

Previous studies have suggested that serum erythropoietin levels in affected patients are lower than expected for the degree of anemia. An earlier study demonstrated a substantial increase in the number of CFU-E in CDA type I pattern on addition of exogenous erythropoietin. The present study reports on the response to recombinant human erythropoietin in 8 patients with CDA type I. Eighteen weeks of treatment, starting at 300 IU/kg twice a week and gradually increasing to 500 IU/kg three times a week, did not have a substantial effect on the mean hemoglobin value. These results indicate that recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) is not beneficial to patients with CDA type I and that the relatively low levels of serum erythropoietin probably play no major role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",M2

Ficol-hypaque-separated mononuclear cells were cultured for 14 d in StemGEM-1d medium with 0, 1, 10 and 100 U/ml of recombinant IFN-alpha2a, recombinant IFN-alpha2b, the genetically-engineered hybrid molecule IFN-alpha(1-8) or the laboratory-designed molecule IFN-alpha(consensus). Erythroid bursts and colonies were counted, picked and processed for electron microscopy. In the experiments employing IFN-alpha2a there were no differences in the numbers of erythroid bursts or colonies between four patients with CDA type I and seven healthy adults. All five patients with CDA type I showed the 'Swiss-cheese' ultrastructural abnormality of the heterochromatin in a proportion of the erythroblasts when the progenitor cells were cultured in the absence of added IFN-alpha. A statistically significant reduction in the proportion of erythroblasts showing the 'Swiss-cheese' defect was seen when the erythroid progenitors were cultured in the presence of 0.01-0.5 U/ml IFN-alpha2a (five patients), or 0.1 U/ml of IFN-alpha2b (two patients). In contrast, no reduction was seen in cultures containing 0.1-100 U/ml of either IFN-alpha(1-8) or IFN-alpha(consensus) or 20 microM hydroxyurea (two patients). The partial correction of the 'Swiss-cheese' abnormality by low concentrations of IFN-alpha2a in vitro provides an experimental model with which the mechanisms underlying the haematological response that occurs after the in vivo administration of this species of IFN-alpha may be investigated.",M2

These were designated CDA types I, II and III. Several other types have been described subsequently and new forms continue to be reported. Some patients with CDA develop iron overload even without repeated blood transfusion and may present with the complications of severe iron overload. Dysmorphic features are seen in some cases, especially of CDA type I. In CDA type II, incomplete processing of N-linked oligosaccharides leads to a marked reduction of polylactosamines associated with band 3 of the red cell membrane. A few cases of CDA type III develop lymphoid neoplasms. Some of the Swedish cases of CDA type III have developed a retinal abnormality characterized by angioid streaks and macular degeneration. The chromosomal localizations of the disease gene in CDA types I and II and in the Swedish family with CDA type III are now known, but the identities of the mutant genes are still unknown. Cases of CDA type I have shown a partial haematological response to interferon-alpha, however the biochemical basis of this response is unclear.

Erythroid precursor and red blood cells (RBCs) show characteristic morphological abnormalities. Biochemical studies have shown that this disease is associated with reduced glycosylation activity, which endows band 3 (anion transporter) with peculiar characteristics. The life span of RBCs may be shortened in patients with CDA-II, a phenomenon that has been ascribed to this membrane defect. We analyzed seven unrelated patients with CDA-II and five control subjects. In all of the CDA-II patients, erythrocytes presented a band 3 that was thinner than usual and also migrated slightly faster on SDS-PAGE. Analysis of anion transport function in CDA-II RBC samples demonstrated decreased anion exchange activity per band 3 molecule. Furthermore, we observed that the CDA-II RBCs contained larger amounts of aggregate band 3 than control erythrocytes. Aggregate band 3 has been reported to bind naturally occurring antibodies that mediate the phagocytic removal of RBCs. We provide evidence that both the phagocytic index (RBCs/macrophage) and the amount of membrane-bound immunoglobulin (IgG) are elevated in CDA-II erythrocytes. Our results suggest that the mild hemolysis observed in patients with CDA-II may be ascribed to clusterization of band 3, which leads to IgG binding and phagocytosis, and not to a secondary modification of the cytoskeletal structure of RBCs.",M2

In CDA type I, bone-marrow electron microscopy reveals characteristic findings in erythroid precursors, including spongy heterochromatin and enlarged nuclear pores. Since the genetic basis of CDA type I is not evident, we used homozygosity and linkage mapping to localize the genetic defect responsible for CDA type I in 25 Bedouins from four large consanguineous families. We report the linkage of this disease to markers on chromosome 15 located at q15. 1-q15.3. Fourteen markers within a 12-cM interval were typed in the relevant family members. Nine of the markers yielded maximum LOD scores of 1.625-12.928 at a recombination fraction of .00. Linkage disequilibrium was found only with marker D15S779. Haplotype analysis revealed eight different carrier haplotypes and highlighted the existence of a founder haplotype. Identification of historical crossover events further narrowed the gene location to between D15S779 and D15S778. The data suggest localization of the CDA type I gene within a 0.5-cM interval. The founder mutation probably occurred &gt;/= 400 years ago. Sequence analysis of the coding region of protein 4.2, the only known erythroid-specific gene in the locus, did not reveal any change in the CDA type I patients. Future analysis of this locus may lead to the identification of a gene essential to normal erythropoiesis.",M2

Previous studies have shown that the anion transporter (band 3) is narrower and it migrates faster on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE); this aspect was related to insufficient glycosylation. Biochemical data support the hypothesis that this disease is due to a deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT II) or alpha-Mannosidase II (alpha-Man II), which represent the key to glycosylation. In addition, a third candidate gene is alpha-Man IIx, which shows a strong homology with alpha-Man II. The knowledge of the chromosomal localization of these putative genes allowed us to perform a linkage study using three sets of microsatellite markers flanking the candidate genes. Six families with two or more affected children were enrolled in this study. The data obtained exclude linkage to all three candidate genes. In consideration of the biochemical data (reduction of enzymatic activity) of the same enzymes, our results suggest the hypothesis that a defect in an unknown transcriptional factor is involved in CDA-II.",M2

It is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance and is characterized by the presence of a large number of multinucleate and binucleate erythroblasts in the bone marrow and typical morphological abnormalities of the membrane of circulating erythrocytes. SDS-PAGE of red blood cell membrane proteins shows a narrower aspect and a faster migration of band 3 (anion exchange transporter). This aspect is consistent with decreased glycosylation of this protein. The genetic mutations responsible for the glycosylation defect in CDA II have not yet been identified. Analysis of carbohydrate structures and biochemical data indicate that the activity of either GnT II or alpha-Man II is reduced in different families, suggesting that the disease is genetically heterogeneous.

The multiple rounded intra-erythroblastic inclusions found in homozygous beta-thalassaemia reacted with the monoclonal antibody against alpha-globin chains but not beta-globin chains, thus confirming that they consisted of precipitated alpha-globin chains. The branching intra-erythroblastic inclusions found in HbH disease and CDA type III reacted with the monoclonal antibody against beta-globin chains but not alpha-globin chains, indicating that they consisted of precipitated beta-globin chains. The two patients with severe CDA had been transfusion-dependent since infancy, had a normal alpha:beta globin chain synthesis ratio or parents with normal red cell indices, displayed prominent dysplastic changes in their erythroblasts, and had intra-erythroblastic inclusions resembling those seen in homozygous beta-thalassaemia. However, unlike those in beta-thalassaemia, the inclusions in these two patients did not react with the monoclonal antibody against either alpha- or beta-globin chains. The inclusions reacted with antibody against zeta-globin chains, but detailed studies in one of the patients indicated that the antigen involved was not zeta-globin. These patients have features not reported in the condition known as dominantly inherited inclusion body beta-thalassaemia and appear to suffer from a novel type of CDA in which the intra-erythroblastic inclusions may consist of some non-globin protein or structurally-abnormal alpha-globin chains.",M2
