20412078,"Improvement in lipid and protein trafficking in Niemann-Pick C1 cells by correction of a secondary enzyme defect.Different primary lysosomal trafficking defects lead to common alterations in lipid trafficking, suggesting cooperative interactions among lysosomal lipids. However, cellular analysis of the functional consequences of this phenomenon is lacking. As a test case, we studied cells with defective Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, a cholesterol trafficking protein whose defect gives rise to lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids, leading to <e>NPC</e> disease. NPC1 cells also develop a secondary defect in acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity despite a normal acid SMase gene (SMPD1). When acid SMase activity was restored to normal levels in NPC1-deficient CHO cells through SMPD1 transfection, there was a dramatic reduction in lysosomal cholesterol. Two other defects, excess lysosomal bis-(monoacylglycerol) phosphate (BMP) and defective transferrin receptor (TfR) recycling, were also markedly improved. To test its relevance in human cells, the acid SMase activity defect in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients was corrected by SMPD1 transfection or acid SMase enzyme replacement. Both treatments resulted in a dramatic reduction in lysosomal cholesterol. These data show that correcting one aspect of a complex lysosomal lipid storage disease can reduce the cellular consequences even if the primary genetic defect is not corrected.",M1
20213549,"Cholesterol in Niemann-Pick Type C disease.Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is associated with accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes in virtually every organ; however, neurodegeneration represents the fatal cause for the disease. Genetic analysis has identified loss-of-function mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 genes as the molecular triggers for the disease. Although the precise function of these proteins has not yet been clarified, recent research suggests that they orchestrate cholesterol efflux from late endosomes/lysosomes. NPC protein deficits result in impairment in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Disruption of cholesterol homeostasis is also associated with deregulation of autophagic activity and early-onset neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of NPC disease. This chapter reviews recent achievements in the investigation of disruption of cholesterol homeostasis-induced neurodegeneration in NPC disease, and provides new insight for developing a potential therapeutic strategy for this disorder.",M1
20212119,"Endocytosis of beta-cyclodextrins is responsible for cholesterol reduction in Niemann-Pick type C mutant cells.Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is a lysosomal storage disorder causing accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomal storage organelles. Recent studies have shown that hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin injections in npc1(-/-) mice are partially effective in treating this disease. Using cultured fibroblasts, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms responsible for reduction of cholesterol accumulation. We show that decreased levels of cholesterol accumulation are maintained for several days after removal of cyclodextrin from the culture medium. This suggests that endocytosed cyclodextrin can reduce the cholesterol storage by acting from inside endocytic organelles rather than by removing cholesterol from the plasma membrane. To test this further, we incubated both NPC1 and NPC2 mutant cells with cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin for 1 h, followed by chase in serum-containing medium. Although the cholesterol content of the treated cells increased after the 1-h incubation, the cholesterol levels in the storage organelles were later reduced significantly. We covalently coupled cyclodextrin to fluorescent dextran polymers. These cyclodextrin-dextran conjugates were delivered to cholesterol-enriched lysosomal storage organelles and were effective at reducing the cholesterol accumulation. We demonstrate that methyl-beta-cyclodextrin is more potent than hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in reducing both cholesterol and bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate accumulation in NPC mutant fibroblasts. Brief treatment of cells with cyclodextrins causes an increase in cholesterol esterification by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase, indicating increased cholesterol delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings suggest that cyclodextrin-mediated enhanced cholesterol transport from the endocytic system can reduce cholesterol accumulation in cells with defects in either NPC1 or NPC2.",M1
20153740,"Abnormal gene expression in cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice during postnatal development.Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with abnormal lipid storage as the major cellular pathologic hallmark. Genetic analyses have identified mutations in NPC1 gene in the great majority of cases, while mutations in NPC2 account for the remainders. Yet little is known regarding the cellular mechanisms responsible for NPC pathogenesis, especially for neurodegeneration, which is the usual cause of death. To identify critical steps that could account for the pathological manifestations of the disease in one of the most affected brain structures, we performed global gene expression analysis in the cerebellum from 3-week old Npc1+/+ and Npc1-/- mice with two different microarray platforms (Agilent and Illumina). Differentially expressed genes identified by both microarray platforms were then subjected to KEGG pathway analysis. Expression of genes in six pathways was significantly altered in Npc1-/- mice; functionally, these signaling pathways belong to the following three categories: (1) steroid and terpenoid biosynthesis, (2) immune response, and (3) cell adhesion/motility. In addition, the expression of several proteins involved in lipid transport was significantly altered in Npc1-/- mice. Our results provide novel molecular insight regarding the mechanisms of pathogenesis in NPC disease and reveal potential new therapeutic targets.",M1
20138836,"Cholesterol accumulation in Niemann Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) model cells causes a shift in APP localization to lipid rafts.It has been suggested that cholesterol may modulate amyloid-beta (Abeta) formation, a causative factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by regulating distribution of the three key proteins in the pathogenesis of AD (beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase (BACE1) and/or presenilin 1 (PS1)) within lipid rafts. In this work we tested whether cholesterol accumulation upon NPC1 dysfunction, which causes Niemann Pick type C disease (NPC), causes increased partitioning of APP into lipid rafts leading to increased CTF/Abeta formation in these cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains. To test this we used CHO NPC1(-/-) cells (NPC cells) and parental CHOwt cells. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation we observed a shift in fl-APP/CTF compartmentalization into lipid raft fractions upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC vs. wt cells. Furthermore, gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment significantly increased fl-APP/CTF distribution in raft fractions in NPC vs. wt cells, suggesting that upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-null cells increased formation of APP-CTF and its increased processing towards Abeta occurs in lipid rafts. Our results support that cholesterol overload, such as in NPC disease, leads to increased partitioning of APP/CTF into lipid rafts resulting in increased amyloidogenic processing of APP in these cholesterol-rich membranes. This work adds to the mechanism of the cholesterol-effect on APP processing and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and supports the role of lipid rafts in these processes.",M1
20070866,"Altered apolipoprotein E glycosylation is associated with Abeta(42) accumulation in an animal model of Niemann-Pick Type C disease.Neurodegeneration is the final cause of death in Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease, a cholesterol-storage disorder. Accumulating evidence indicates that NPC may share common pathological mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease, including the link between aberrant cholesterol metabolism and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is highly expressed in the brain and plays a pivotal role in cholesterol metabolism. ApoE can also modulate Abeta production and clearance, and it is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Although apoE is glycosylated, the functional significance of this chemical alteration on Abeta catabolism is unclear. In this study using an NPC animal model, we detect specific changes in apoE glycosylation that correlate with increased Abeta(42) accumulation prior to the appearance of neurological abnormalities. This suggests that increased apoE expression could be a compensatory response to the increased Abeta(42) deposition in NPC(nih) mice. We also observe what appears to be a simplification of the glycosylation process on apoE during neurodegeneration.",M1
20007718,"Conditional Niemann-Pick C mice demonstrate cell autonomous Purkinje cell neurodegeneration.Pathways regulating neuronal vulnerability are poorly understood, yet are central to identifying therapeutic targets for degenerative neurological diseases. Here, we characterize mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by impaired cholesterol trafficking. To date, the relative contributions of neuronal and glial defects to neuron loss are poorly defined. Using gene targeting, we generate Npc1 conditional null mutant mice. Deletion of Npc1 in mature cerebellar Purkinje cells leads to an age-dependent impairment in motor tasks, including rotarod and balance beam performance. Surprisingly, these mice did not show the early death or weight loss that are characteristic of global Npc1 null mice, suggesting that Purkinje cell degeneration does not underlie these phenotypes. Histological examination revealed the progressive loss of Purkinje cells in an anterior-to-posterior gradient. This cell autonomous neurodegeneration occurs in a spatiotemporal pattern similar to that of global knockout mice. A subpopulation of Purkinje cells in the posterior cerebellum exhibits marked resistance to cell death despite Npc1 deletion. To explore this selective response, we investigated the electrophysiological properties of vulnerable and susceptible Purkinje cell subpopulations. Unexpectedly, Purkinje cells in both subpopulations displayed no electrophysiological abnormalities prior to degeneration. Our data establish that Npc1 deficiency leads to cell autonomous, selective neurodegeneration and suggest that the ataxic symptoms of NPC disease arise from Purkinje cell death rather than cellular dysfunction.",M1
19948501,"Adenovirus RID-alpha activates an autonomous cholesterol regulatory mechanism that rescues defects linked to Niemann-Pick disease type C.Host-pathogen interactions are important model systems for understanding fundamental cell biological processes. In this study, we describe a cholesterol-trafficking pathway induced by the adenovirus membrane protein RID-alpha that also subverts the cellular autophagy pathway during early stages of an acute infection. A palmitoylation-defective RID-alpha mutant deregulates cholesterol homeostasis and elicits lysosomal storage abnormalities similar to mutations associated with Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease. Wild-type RID-alpha rescues lipid-sorting defects in cells from patients with this disease by a mechanism involving a class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. In contrast to NPC disease gene products that are localized to late endosomes/lysosomes, RID-alpha induces the accumulation of autophagy-like vesicles with a unique molecular composition. Ectopic RID-alpha regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking at two distinct levels: the egress from endosomes and transport to the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for homeostatic gene regulation. However, RID-alpha also induces a novel cellular phenotype, suggesting that it activates an autonomous cholesterol regulatory mechanism distinct from NPC disease gene products.",M1
19939718,"Eye movement and diffusion tensor imaging analysis of treatment effects in a Niemann-Pick Type C patient.New treatment options for Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) have recently become available. To assess the efficiency and efficacy of these new treatment markers for disease status and progression are needed. Both the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression are challenging and mostly rely on clinical impression and functional testing of horizontal eye movements. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about the microintegrity especially of white matter. We show here in a case report how DTI and measures derived from this imaging method can serve as adjunct quantitative markers for disease management in Niemann-Pick Type C. Two approaches are taken--first, we compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter globally between a 29-year-old NPC patient and 18 healthy age-matched controls and show the remarkable difference in FA relatively early in the course of the disease. Second, a voxelwise comparison of FA values reveals where white matter integrity is compromised locally and demonstrate an individualized analysis of FA changes before and after 1year of treatment with Miglustat. This method might be useful in future treatment trials for NPC to assess treatment effects.",M1
19900398,"Cholesterol as a factor regulating intracellular localization of annexin A6 in Niemann-Pick type C human skin fibroblasts.Lysosome-like storage organelles (LSOs) play a crucial role in excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease characterized by altered vesicular traffic of lipids. Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is mainly present in cytosol but upon elevation of [Ca(2+)](in) binds to membranes. In addition, a pH or cholesterol-dependent mechanism of AnxA6 interaction with membranes was described. We found a several fold enrichment of AnxA6 in LSO compartment in fibroblasts isolated from NPC patients in comparison with fibroblasts from healthy individuals. We observed that AnxA6 relocates from cytosol to LSOs in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Cholesterol depletion caused reduction in the binding of AnxA6. Moreover, we found that in NPC cells AnxA6 translocates to the perinuclear region containing late endosomes (LE) loaded with cholesterol. We conclude that AnxA6 may participate in formation of cholesterol-rich platforms on LE and therefore may contribute to the pathology of the NPC disease.",M1
19893049,"Increased activity and altered subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes determine neuronal vulnerability in Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient mice.Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>), caused by mutations in the Npc1 or Npc2 genes, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intracellular accumulation/redistribution of cholesterol in a number of tissues including the brain. This is accompanied by a severe loss of neurons in selected brain regions. In this study, we evaluated the role of lysosomal enzymes, cathepsins B and D, in determining neuronal vulnerability in NPC1-deficient (Npc1(-/-)) mouse brains. Our results showed that Npc1(-/-) mice exhibit an age-dependent degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum but not in the hippocampus. The cellular level/expression and activity of cathepsins B and D are increased more predominantly in the cerebellum than in the hippocampus of Npc1(-/-) mice. In addition, the cytosolic levels of cathepsins, cytochrome c, and Bax2 are higher in the cerebellum than in the hippocampus of Npc1(-/-) mice, suggesting a role for these enzymes in the degeneration of neurons. This suggestion is supported by our observation that degeneration of cultured cortical neurons treated with U18666A, which induces an NPC1-like phenotype at the cellular level, can be attenuated by inhibition of cathepsin B or D enzyme activity. These results suggest that the increased level/activity and altered subcellular distribution of cathepsins may be associated with the underlying cause of neuronal vulnerability in Npc1(-/-) brains. Therefore, their inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in attenuating NPC pathology.",M1
19883762,"Lack of Niemann-Pick type C1 induces age-related degeneration in the mouse retina.Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease and caused by mutations in Npc1 or Npc2, which mediate cooperatively the egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. The disease entails progressive neurodegeneration, whose cause is poorly understood. Here, we report that Npc1 is distributed in distinct layers of the mouse retina and that its deficiency causes striking retinal degeneration in 2-month-old mice with signs of age-related maculopathies. This includes impaired visual function, accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium layer, degeneration of photoreceptor outer segments, disruption of synaptic layers and an increase in autophagy markers in the ganglion cell layer. Moreover, the lack of Npc1 results in the upregulation of proteins that mediate cellular cholesterol release in the retina. Our findings suggest that Npc1 is required for normal retinal function and that its absence may serve as model to study age-related degeneration of the retina.",M1

The synthetic route allows for the production of analogues, including photoaffinity and biotinylated derivatives. Compound 1a increased esterification by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase in NPC1 mutant cells.

19750228,"Chronic cyclodextrin treatment of murine Niemann-Pick C disease ameliorates neuronal cholesterol and glycosphingolipid storage and disease progression.BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused most commonly by a defect in the NPC1 protein and characterized by widespread intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). While current treatment therapies are limited, a few drugs tested in Npc1(-/-) mice have shown partial benefit. During a combination treatment trial using two such compounds, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and allopregnanolone, we noted increased lifespan for Npc1(-/-) mice receiving only 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD), the vehicle for allopregnanolone. This finding suggested that administration of CD alone, but with greater frequency, might provide additional benefit. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Administration of CD to Npc1(-/-) mice beginning at either P7 or P21 and continuing every other day delayed clinical onset, reduced intraneuronal cholesterol and GSL storage as well as free sphingosine accumulation, reduced markers of neurodegeneration, and led to longer survival than any previous treatment regime. We reasoned that other lysosomal diseases characterized by cholesterol and GSL accumulation, including NPC disease due to NPC2 deficiency, GM1 gangliosidosis and mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA, might likewise benefit from CD treatment. Treated Npc2(-/-) mice showed benefits similar to NPC1 disease, however, mice with GM1 gangliosidosis or MPS IIIA failed to show reduction in storage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Treatment with CD delayed clinical disease onset, reduced intraneuronal storage and secondary markers of neurodegeneration, and significantly increased lifespan of both Npc1(-/-) and Npc2(-/-) mice. In contrast, CD failed to ameliorate cholesterol or glycosphingolipid storage in GM1 gangliosidosis and MPS IIIA disease. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which CD leads to reduced neuronal storage may provide important new opportunities for treatment of NPC and related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cholesterol dyshomeostasis.",M1
19699313,"Chemical screen to reduce sterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick C disease cells identifies novel lysosomal acid lipase inhibitors.Niemann-Pick C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is a lysosomal storage disorder causing abnormal accumulation of unesterified free cholesterol in lysosomal storage organelles. High content phenotypic microscopy chemical screens in both human and hamster NPC-deficient cells have identified several compounds that partially revert the NPC phenotype. Cell biological and biochemical studies show that several of these molecules inhibit lysosomal acid lipase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes LDL-derived triacylglycerol and cholesteryl esters. The effects of reduced lysosomal acid lipase activity in lowering cholesterol accumulation in NPC mutant cells were verified by RNAi-mediated knockdown of lysosomal acid lipase in NPC1-deficient human fibroblasts. This work demonstrates the utility of phenotypic cellular screens as a means to identify molecular targets for altering a complex process such as intracellular cholesterol trafficking and metabolism.",M1
19672994,"Spiral analysis in Niemann-Pick disease type C.Spiral analysis is a computerized method of analyzing upper limb motor physiology through the quantification of spiral drawing. The objective of this study was to determine whether spirals drawn by patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) could be distinguished from those of controls, and to physiologically characterize movement abnormalities in NPC. Spiral data consisting of position, pressure, and time were collected from 14 NPC patients and 14 age-matched controls, and were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. NPC spirals were characterized by: lower speed (2.67 vs. 9.56 cm/s, P &lt; 0.001) and acceleration (0.10 vs. 2.04 cm/s(2), P &lt; 0.001), higher loop width variability (0.88 vs. 0.28, P &lt; 0.001), tremor (5/10 vs. 0/10 trials in the dominant hand, P &lt; 0.001), and poor overall spiral rating (2.53 vs. 0.70, P &lt; 0.005). NPC spirals also exhibited sustained drawing pressure profiles that were abnormally invariant with time. Other features, such as the tightness of loop widths, were normal. Our findings reveal that differing aspects of tremor, Parkinsonism, ataxia, and dystonia are quantifiable in NPC patients.",M1
19660552,"Cholesterol involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.Cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes, plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and transmembrane communication within and between cellular compartments. In the brain that contains the highest levels of cholesterol in the body, cholesterol traffic occurs between nerve cells and between intracellular organelles in neurons to subserve normal brain function. Whereas glial cells produce the largest quantities of cholesterol, neurons also acquire cholesterol synthesized by astrocytes. The intracellular organelle endosomes and lysosomes receive and distribute cholesterol through the endocytic and retrograde transport pathways. However, deregulated cholesterol trafficking appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) diseases. Under the pathological conditions of these neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant molecular interactions or particular depositions of cholesterol have been observed as critical causes to precipitate neuronal cell death. Here, we review the recent advances in terms of the role of cholesterol in healthy brain and molecular mechanisms of cholesterol involvement in AD, PD and NPC diseases. We discuss the different lines of evidence supporting different models of anomalous intracellular cholesterol trafficking with emphasis on cholesterol interactions with alpha-synuclein, NPC1 and NPC2 in AD, PD and NPC.",M1
19601769,"Neurodegeneration in Niemann-Pick Type C disease and Huntington's disease: impact of defects in membrane trafficking.Although neurodegenerative diseases exhibit distinct pathologies, such as affected neuronal cell population, age of onset, and pathological symptoms, overlapping characteristics can be observed at the cellular level. In particular, several neurodegenerative diseases display defects in intracellular vesicular trafficking. Here we discuss the range of cellular phenotypes observed in two rare neurodegenerative diseases, Niemann-Pick Type C and Huntington's Disease, both of which involve vesicular trafficking defects that may contribute to neuronal cell death. In <e>NPC</e>, the primary defect is cholesterol and glycosphingolipid accumulation, but NPC mutant cells display widespread trafficking alterations. In HD, protein aggregates are a hallmark feature, but HD cells also exhibit changes in vesicular traffic, including axonal transport and early endosomal trafficking, that likely impact neuronal cell viability. Here we discuss current therapies that seek to address cellular defects in NPC and HD and describe areas of investigation that may lead to new therapeutic treatment.",M1
19566836,"Niemann-Pick Disease Type C: from molecule to clinic.1. Niemann-Pick Type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is an incurable cholesterol-storage disorder that stems from inherited deficiencies of lysosomal proteins involved in intracellular lipid-trafficking proteins. The condition manifests as progressive neurological impairment and leads to death at an early age. 2. To improve clinical recognization and investigate therapeutic strategies, recent studies using molecular and genetic approaches have led to significant advances in the creation of animal models of NPC, as well as in the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NPC. 3. Patients with NPC are divided into four groups based on age at presentation, whereas the clinical features of NPC can be divided into five categories based on the severity of the disease. Progressive neuronal loss, especially of cerebellar Purkinje cells, is a hallmark of NPC. Ballooned neurons, axonal abnormalities and astroglyosis are among the pathological changes seen. Severe demyelination is also present in the mouse model of NPC. 4. Mutations in the NPC1 gene cause approximately 95% of cases of NPC, whereas mutations in the NPC2 gene account for the remainder of cases. NPC1 is a transmembrane protein and NPC2 is a soluble protein involved in lipid trafficking in lysosomes. Loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene lead to a failure of the calcium-mediated fusion of endosomes with lysosomes, resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. 5. The present review updates the disorders of NPC from clinical features to animal models and molecular mechanisms.",M1
19540204,"Cyclodextrins promote protein aggregation posing risks for therapeutic applications.The presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a hallmark feature of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's (AD) and Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) diseases. NFTs have been correlated with elevated cholesterol levels and a cholesterol-scavenging compound, cyclodextrin, effectively modulates and traffics cholesterol from cell bodies in NPC disease models. Cyclodextrins are also used as drug carriers to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and other tissues. While cyclodextrins have potential value in treating brain diseases, it is important to determine how cyclodextrins affect natively unfolded proteins such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) whose aggregation has been correlated with AD. We show that cyclodextrins drastically alter Abeta aggregation kinetics and induce morphological changes to Abeta that can enhance toxicity towards SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that care must be taken when using cyclodextrins for BBB delivery or for treatment of brain disease because cyclodextrins can promote toxic aggregation of Abeta.",M1
19472223,"Amelioration of enteric neuropathology in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick C by Npc1 expression in enteric glia.Niemann-Pick C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is an autosomal recessive, lethal, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in NPC1. By using the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, we demonstrated previously that astrocyte-specific expression of Npc1 decreased neuronal storage of cholesterol in Npc1(-/-) mice; reduced numbers of axonal spheroids; and produced less degeneration of neurons, reactive astrocytes, and loss of myelin tracts in the central nervous system. GFAP-Npc1, Npc1(-/-) mice exhibited markedly enhanced survival, and death was not associated with the severe terminal weight loss observed in Npc1(-/-) mice. Intestinal transit is delayed in Npc1(-/-) mice but is normal in GFAP-NPC1, Npc1(-/-) until late in the course of their disease. Because glia play an important role in the enteric nervous system, we studied morphology and cholesterol content of intestines from Npc1(-/-) mice and examined the effect of GFAP-promoted restoration of Npc1 in enteric glia. Although the number of neurons was not altered, the total amount of cholesterol stored in the small intestine was decreased, as were the number of neurons with inclusions and the number of inclusions per neuron. We conclude that expression of Npc1 by enteric glial cells can ameliorate the enteric neuropathology, and we speculate that dysfunction of the enteric nervous system contributes to the retarded intestinal transit, weight loss, and demise of Npc1(-/-) mice.",M1
19415691,"Linear clinical progression, independent of age of onset, in Niemann-Pick disease, type C.Niemann-Pick disease, type C is a neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder with a broad clinical spectrum and a variable age of onset. The absence of a universally accepted clinical outcome measure is an impediment to the design of a therapeutic trial for <e>NPC</e>. Thus, we developed a clinical severity scale to characterize and quantify disease progression. Clinical signs and symptoms in nine major (ambulation, cognition, eye movement, fine motor, hearing, memory, seizures, speech, and swallowing) and eight minor (auditory brainstem response, behavior, gelastic cataplexy, hyperreflexia, incontinence, narcolepsy, psychiatric, and respiratory problems) domains were scored. Data were collected from 18 current NPC patients and were extracted from records of 19 patients. Both patient cohorts showed a linear increase in severity scores over time. Cross-sectional evaluation of current patients showed a linear increase in the severity score. Longitudinal chart review of historical data demonstrated that although age of onset varied significantly, the rate of progression appeared linear, independent of age of onset, and similar in all patients. Combining the data from both cohorts, disease progression could be modeled by the following equation:  ?(t0+x) =  ?(t0) + 1.87x; where  ?(t0) is the initial score and  ?(t0+x) is the predicted future score after x years. Our observation that disease progression is similar across patients and independent of age of onset is consistent with a biphasic pathological model for NPC. This scale may prove useful in the characterization of potential biomarkers, and as an outcome measure to monitor disease progression in NPC patients.",M1
19365558,"ARF6-mediated endosome recycling reverses lipid accumulation defects in Niemann-Pick Type C disease.In human Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease, endosomal trafficking defects lead to an accumulation of free cholesterol and other lipids in late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartments, a subsequent block in cholesterol esterification and significantly reduced cholesterol efflux out of the cell. Here we report that nucleotide cycling or cellular knockdown of the small GTP-binding protein, ARF6, markedly impacts cholesterol homeostasis. Unregulated ARF6 activation attenuates the NPC phenotype at least in part by decreasing cholesterol accumulation and restoring normal sphingolipid trafficking. These effects depend on ARF6-stimulated cholesterol efflux out of the endosomal recycling compartment, a major cell repository for free cholesterol. We also show that fibroblasts derived from different NPC patients displayed varying levels of ARF6 that is GTP-bound, which correlate with their response to sustained ARF6 activation. These studies support emerging evidence that early endocytic defects impact NPC disease and suggest that such heterogeneity in NPC disease could result in diverse responses to therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the trafficking of lipids.",M1
19332999,"Tau normal function influences Niemann-Pick type C disease  pathogenesis in mice and modulates autophagy in NPC1-deficient cells.The tauopathies are a diverse class of devastating neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule binding protein tau. Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is a tauopathy that affects children,and is caused by mutations in intracellular lipid and cholesterol trafficking proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1gene are responsible for 95 percent of all NPC cases, and lead to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. To assess the extent to which tau affects NPC pathology, we generated mice that lack both NPC1 and tau. NPC1/tau double-null mutants exhibit an exacerbated NPC phenotype, including severe systemic manifestations,and die significantly earlier than NPC1 single-null mutants.Since autophagy has been previously implicated in NPC pathogenesis,we investigated the impact of tau deletion on this pathway.Acute reductions of tau in NPC1-deficient fibroblasts significantly decrease autophagic induction and flux, while having no effect on the autophagic pathway in control cells. Here we propose a model in which tau's normal function is critical to the induction of autophagy in NPC1 deficiency, and suggest that this novel mechanism contributes to cellular dysfunction in the tauopathies.",M1
19328188,"Allopregnanolone treatment delays cholesterol accumulation and reduces autophagic/lysosomal dysfunction and inflammation in Npc1-/- mouse brain.Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a devastating developmental disorder with progressive and fatal neurodegeneration. Previous work has shown that a single injection of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone at postnatal day 7 significantly prolonged lifespan of Npc1-/- mice. However, the cellular/molecular basis for this beneficial effect remains undefined. Here, we further characterized the effect of allopregnanolone treatment on cholesterol accumulation, a pathological hallmark of NPC, as well as on autophagic/lysosomal dysfunction, myelination and inflammation in Npc1-/- mouse brains. At 1 month postnatal, accumulation of filipin-labeled unesterified cholesterol was clearly evident not only in neurons but also in microglia in untreated mutant mice, but was mostly absent in allopregnanolone-treated animals. Brain levels of the lysosomal enzymes cathepsins B and D were significantly higher in Npc1-/- than in wild-type mice. Levels of LC3-II, an autophagy marker, were also increased in mutant mouse brain as compared to wild-type mouse brain. Both changes were significantly reduced by allopregnanolone treatment. Injection of the neurosteroid also significantly reduced astrocyte proliferation and microglial activation. Furthermore, allopregnanolone treatment significantly enhanced myelination in mutant mice. Taken together, our results clearly show that allopregnanolone treatment not only reduces cholesterol accumulation and improves autophagic/lysosomal function but also enhances myelination and reduces inflammation. These results provide further support for the potential usefulness of allopregnanolone for treating NPC disease.",M1
19307542,"Saccades in adult Niemann-Pick disease type C reflect frontal, brainstem, and biochemical deficits.BACKGROUND: The autosomal recessive disorder Niemannn-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) presents in adulthood with psychosis or cognitive deficits associated with supranuclear gaze palsies. While saccadic innervation to the extraocular muscles is generated in the brainstem, the frontal lobes play an integral role in the initiation of volitional saccades and the suppression of unwanted reflexive saccades. No study has examined the frontally driven volitional control of saccadic eye movements in NPC. OBJECTIVE: To examine self-paced and antisaccades as well as reflexive saccades in adult patients with NPC, a disorder known to affect brainstem and frontal cortical function. METHODS: Three biochemically confirmed adult patients with NPC were compared with 10 matched controls on horizontal saccadic and antisaccadic measures using an infrared limbus eye tracker. Patients' cholesterol esterification and filipin staining, Mini-Mental State performance, and NPC symptom level were rated. RESULTS: Reflexive saccade latency ranged from shorter to longer than normal, reflexive saccade gain was reduced, asymptotic peak velocity was reduced, fewer self-paced saccades were generated, and increased errors on antisaccades were made by patients compared to controls. Patients with more severe biochemical, cognitive, and symptom deficits performed most poorly on brainstem and frontal ocular motor measures. Paradoxically, less severe illness was associated with an abnormally reduced saccadic latency. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular motor measures provide an index of disease severity in Niemannn-Pick type C (NPC) and may be a useful adjunct for monitoring the illness progress and medication response. Reduced saccadic latency may result from inadequate fixation input from abnormally functioning frontal eye fields in NPC.",M1
19206179,"The clinical spectrum of fetal Niemann-Pick type C.Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a lysosomal neurovisceral storage disease. The spectrum of the clinical presentation as well as the severity of the disease and the age of presentation may be highly variable. Fetal presentation is rarely described in the literature. Here, we report on seven new cases of fetal onset NPC of whom two were diagnosed in utero and five postnatally. The fetal clinical presentation, included, in utero splenomegaly (6/7), in utero hepatomegaly (5/7), in utero ascites (4/7), intra uterine growth retardation (IUGR) (2/7), and oligohydramnios (2/7). Placentomegaly was present in two of the three pregnancies examined. Congenital thrombocytopenia (4/4), congenital anemia (2/4), and petechial rash (2/5) were diagnosed immediately after birth. Three patients were born preterm. Pregnancy and postnatal outcome were remarkably poor with one case of intrauterine fetal death, one elective termination of pregnancy, and four patients who died within the first months of life from a rapidly fatal neonatal cholestatic disease. NPC1 gene mutation analysis identified all of the mutant alleles including three novel mutations. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and ascites were the most consistent prenatal ultrasonographic findings of the NPC fetuses. We suggest that once identified these findings, should raise the suspicion of fetal NPC. Our study further expands the antenatal clinical spectrum of NPC and provides clues to its prenatal diagnosis.",M1
19074461,"Tau deletion exacerbates the phenotype of Niemann-Pick type C mice and implicates autophagy in pathogenesis.Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-binding protein tau characterize a diverse array of neurodegenerative disorders. Most of these lack mutations in the encoding MAPT gene, and the role of tau in disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Among these tauopathies is Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>), a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and premature death, most often caused by an inherited deficiency in the intracellular lipid trafficking protein NPC1. To determine the extent to which tau affects NPC pathogenesis, we generated Npc1-/- mice deficient in tau. Unexpectedly, NPC1/tau double null mutants are generated in markedly smaller litters, exhibit an enhanced systemic phenotype and die significantly earlier than NPC1 single null mutants. As autophagy is up-regulated in NPC and protein degradation through this pathway depends on movement along microtubules, we knocked down MAPT expression in NPC1-deficient human fibroblasts and examined effects on this pathway. We show that an acute reduction of tau expression in a cellular model of NPC decreases induction and flux through the autophagic pathway. Our data establish that MAPT deletion exacerbates the NPC phenotype through a mechanism independent of tau protein aggregation and identifies a critical role for tau in the regulation of autophagy in NPC1-deficient cells.",M1
19013089,"24 month-treatment with miglustat of three patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C: follow up using brain spectroscopy.Niemann-Pick C (<e>NPC</e>) is a fatal progressive neurolipidosis. Miglustat, an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid synthesis, has been proposed to treat patients but questions remain regarding its efficacy. A major problem has been the lack of suitable objective efficacy endpoints. Three adults with NPC were treated with miglustat for 24 months. Efficacy of treatment was assessed clinically and using brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All patients reported mild clinical improvement or stabilization. Furthermore, a sustained decrease in the choline/creatine ratio was observed in all three patients over time. Although these preliminary results require confirmation on a larger cohort of patients, they suggest that miglustat has some beneficial effect on brain dysfunction in NPC and that MRS could be used routinely as a non invasive surrogate marker of treatment efficacy.",M1
18953351,"Niemann-Pick disease type C1 is a sphingosine storage disease that causes deregulation of lysosomal calcium.Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the acidic compartment (which we define as the late endosome and the lysosome) protein, NPC1. The function of NPC1 is unknown, but when it is dysfunctional, sphingosine, glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin and cholesterol accumulate. We have found that NPC1-mutant cells have a large reduction in the acidic compartment calcium store compared to wild-type cells. Chelating luminal endocytic calcium in normal cells with high-affinity Rhod-dextran induced an <e>NPC</e> disease cellular phenotype. In a drug-induced NPC disease cellular model, sphingosine storage in the acidic compartment led to calcium depletion in these organelles, which then resulted in cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid storage in these compartments. Sphingosine storage is therefore an initiating factor in NPC1 disease pathogenesis that causes altered calcium homeostasis, leading to the secondary storage of sphingolipids and cholesterol. This unique calcium phenotype represents a new target for therapeutic intervention, as elevation of cytosolic calcium with curcumin normalized NPC1 disease cellular phenotypes and prolonged survival of the NPC1 mouse.",M1
18823126,"Regulation of sterol transport between membranes and NPC2.Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) is caused by defects in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene and is characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in the late endosome/lysosome compartment. NPC2 is an intralysosomal protein that binds cholesterol in vitro. Previous studies demonstrated rapid rates of cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to model membranes [Cheruku, S. R., et al. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 31594-31604]. To model the potential role of NPC2 as a lysosomal cholesterol export protein, in this study we used fluorescence spectroscopic approaches to examine cholesterol transfer from membranes to NPC2, assessing the rate, mechanism, and regulation of this transport step. In addition, we examined the effect of NPC2 on the rate and kinetic mechanism of intermembrane sterol transport, to model the movement of cholesterol from internal lysosomal membranes to the limiting lysosomal membrane. The results support the hypothesis that NPC2 plays an important role in endo/lysosomal cholesterol trafficking by markedly accelerating the rates of cholesterol transport. Rates of sterol transfer from and between membranes were increased by as much as 2 orders of magnitude by NPC2. The transfer studies indicate that the mechanism of NPC2 action involves direct interaction of the protein with membranes. Such interactions were observed directly using FTIR spectroscopy and protein tryptophan spectral shifts. Additionally, cholesterol transfer by NPC2 was found to be greatly enhanced by the unique lysosomal phospholipid lyso-bisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), suggesting an important role for LBPA in NPC2-mediated cholesterol trafficking.",M1
18790990,"cAMP-mediated regulation of cholesterol accumulation in cystic fibrosis and Niemann-Pick type C cells.The goal of this study was to identify a mechanism regulating cholesterol accumulation in cystic fibrosis (CF) cells. Both CFTR activation and expression are regulated by the cAMP pathway, and it is hypothesized that a feedback response involving this pathway may be involved in the phenotype of cholesterol accumulation. To examine the role of the cAMP pathway in cholesterol accumulation, we treated two CF model cell lines with the Rp diastereomer of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and visualized by filipin staining. Rp-cAMPS treatment eliminated cholesterol accumulation in CF cells, whereas 8-bromo-cAMP treatment led to cholesterol accumulation in wild-type cells. To confirm these findings in an independent model system, we also examined the role of cAMP in modulating cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) fibroblasts. Expression of the protein related to NPC, NPC1, is also directly regulated by cAMP; therefore, it is postulated that NPC cells exhibit the same cAMP-mediated control of cholesterol accumulation. Cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells also was reduced by the presence of Rp-cAMPS. Expression of beta-arrestin-2 (betaarr2), a marker of cellular response to cAMP signaling, was significantly elevated in CF model cells, Cftr(-/-) MNE, primary tissue obtained by nasal scrapes from CF subjects, and in NPC fibroblasts compared with respective controls.",M1
18782459,"The pathogenesis of Niemann-Pick type C disease: a role for autophagy?Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is a sphingolipid-storage disorder that results from inherited deficiencies of intracellular lipid-trafficking proteins, and is characterised by an accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. Patients with this disorder develop progressive neurological impairment that often begins in childhood, is ultimately fatal and is currently untreatable. How impaired lipid trafficking leads to neurodegeneration is largely unknown. Here we review NPC clinical features and biochemical defects, and discuss model systems used to study this disorder. Recent studies have established that NPC is associated with an induction of autophagy, a regulated and evolutionarily conserved process by which cytoplasmic proteins are sequestered within autophagosomes and targeted for degradation. This pathway enables recycling of limited or damaged macromolecules to promote cell survival. However, in other instances, robust activation of autophagy leads to cell stress and programmed cell death. We summarise evidence showing that autophagy induction and flux are increased in NPC by signalling through a complex of the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase and beclin-1. We propose that an imbalance between induction and flux through the autophagic pathway contributes to cell stress and neuronal loss in NPC and related sphingolipid-storage disorders, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies for modulating activity of this pathway.",M1
18778306,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity may not be necessary for the neuropathology of Niemann-Pick type C mice.Hyperphosphorylation of neurofilament and tau, and formation of cytoskeletal lesions, are notable features of several human neurodegenerative diseases, including Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (<e>NPC</e>). Previous studies suggested that the MAPKs, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) may play a significant role in this aspect of NPC. To test this idea, we treated npc mice with PD98059, a specific and potent inhibitor of MAPK activation. Although activity of ERK1/2 was inhibited by 40%, a 2-week intracerebroventricular infusion of PD98059 just prior to onset of cytoskeletal pathology and symptoms in npc mice did not delay or inhibit prominent hallmarks of NPC. Unexpectedly, ERK1/2 inhibition led to aggravation of tau hyperphosphorylation, particularly in oligodendroctyes, in a manner similar to that of certain human tauopathies. Our results suggest that ERK1/2 does not play a major role in NPC neuropathology, and therefore, that MAPK inhibition is unlikely to be a useful strategy for managing the disease.",M1
18681838,"Endosomal lipid accumulation in NPC1 leads to inhibition of PKC, hypophosphorylation of vimentin and Rab9 entrapment.BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Within the group of lysosomal storage diseases, NPC1 [<e>NPC</e> (Niemann-Pick type C) 1] disease is a lipidosis characterized by excessive accumulation of free cholesterol as well as gangliosides, glycosphingolipids and fatty acids in the late E/L (endosomal/lysosomal) system (Chen et al., 2005) due to a defect in late endosome lipid egress. We have previously demonstrated that expression of the small GTPase Rab9 in NPC1 cells can rescue the lipid transport block phenotype (Walter et al., 2003), albeit by an undefined mechanism. RESULTS: To investigate further the mechanism by which Rab9 facilitates lipid movement from late endosomes we sought to identify novel Rab9 binding/interacting proteins. In the present study, we report that Rab9 interacts with the intermediate filament phosphoprotein vimentin and this interaction is altered by lipid accumulation in late endosomes, which results in inhibition of PKC (protein kinase C) and hypophosphorylation of vimentin, leading to late endosome dysfunction. Intermediate filament hypophosphorylation, aggregation and entrapment of Rab9 ultimately leads to transport defects and inhibition of lipid egress from late endosomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal a previously unappreciated interaction between Rab proteins and intermediate filaments in regulating intracellular lipid transport.",M1
18644787,"Lysobisphosphatidic acid controls endosomal cholesterol levels.Most cell types acquire cholesterol by endocytosis of circulating low density lipoprotein, but little is known about the mechanisms of intra-endosomal cholesterol transport and about the primary cause of its aberrant accumulation in the cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>). Here we report that lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), an unconventional phospholipid that is only detected in late endosomes, regulates endosomal cholesterol levels under the control of Alix/AlP1, which is an LBPA-interacting protein involved in sorting into multivesicular endosomes. We find that Alix down-expression decreases both LBPA levels and the lumenal vesicle content of late endosomes. Cellular cholesterol levels are also decreased, presumably because the storage capacity of endosomes is affected and thus cholesterol clearance accelerated. Both lumenal membranes and cholesterol can be restored in Alix knockdown cells by exogenously added LBPA. Conversely, we also find that LBPA becomes limiting upon pathological cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells, because the addition of exogenous LBPA, but not of LBPA isoforms or analogues, partially reverts the NPC phenotype. We conclude that LBPA controls the cholesterol capacity of endosomes.",M1
18591368,"Imatinib therapy blocks cerebellar apoptosis and improves neurological symptoms in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C disease.Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of free cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the endosomal-lysosomal system. Patients with NPC disease have markedly progressive neuronal loss, mainly of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. There is strong evidence indicating that cholesterol accumulation and trafficking defects activate apoptosis in NPC brains. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relevance of apoptosis and particularly the proapoptotic c-Abl/p73 system in cerebellar neuron degeneration in NPC disease. We used the NPC1 mouse model to evaluate c-Abl/p73 expression and activation in the cerebellum and the effect of therapy with the c-Abl-specific inhibitor imatinib. The proapoptotic c-Abl/p73 system and the p73 target genes are expressed in the cerebellums of NPC mice. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Abl with imatinib preserved Purkinje neurons and reduced general cell apoptosis in the cerebellum, improved neurological symptoms, and increased the survival of NPC mice. Moreover, this prosurvival effect correlated with reduced mRNA levels of p73 proapoptotic target genes. Our results suggest that the c-Abl/p73 pathway is involved in NPC neurodegeneration and show that treatment with c-Abl inhibitors is useful in delaying progressive neurodegeneration, supporting the use of imatinib for clinical treatment of patients with NPC disease.",M1

The diffusion of water in white matter tracts of Npc1(-/-) mice at this young age was already abnormal, exhibiting decreased anisotropy, as quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA), compared with their wild-type littermates, the controls. Postmortem histological staining revealed myelin deficiencies in Npc1(-/-) mice, consistent with the reduction in FA measured in vivo. Beneficial effects of treatment with allopregnanolone and/or 2 hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was also detectable at this age by FA, which correlated with increased myelination as seen by histology. This is the earliest detection of a therapeutic effect in Npc1(-/-) mice.",M1
18500759,"Astrocyte-only Npc1 reduces neuronal cholesterol and triples life span of Npc1-/- mice.Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is an autosomal recessive, lethal neurodegenerative disorder. Although neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in the mouse model (Npc1(-/-)) is thought to be autonomous, the basis of neuronal death in other regions of the brain remains elusive. We addressed this issue in vivo by using the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter to direct astrocyte-specific, replacement expression of Npc1 in Npc1(-/-) mice. These mice showed enhanced survival, decreased neuronal storage of cholesterol associated with less accumulation of axonal spheroids, lower numbers of degenerated neurons and reactive astrocytes, and restoration of myelin tracts. Their death was not associated with the usual terminal decline in weight but instead with a loss of Purkinje cells and motor coordination. We conclude that neurodegeneration of Npc1(-/-) mice is greatly affected by the loss of fibrillary astrocyte function.",M1

Patients exhibit prolonged neonatal jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive neurodegeneration that generally result in death by the teen years. Most clinical cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. Current mouse models of NPC are not well suited for studying the liver disease due to the rapidly progressing neurological disease. To facilitate study of NPC-associated liver dysfunction, we have developed a novel mouse model using antisense oligonucleotides to ablate NPC1 expression primarily in the liver. Here, we show that the NPC1 knockdown leads to a liver disease phenotype similar to that of patients with NPC and the NPC(nih) mouse model. Key features include hepatomegaly, lipid storage, elevated serum liver enzymes, and increased apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This novel NPC1 antisense mouse model will allow delineation of the mechanism by which NPC1 dysfunction leads to liver cell death.",M1
18190929,"Brainstem neuropathology in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick disease type C.Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) is a neurovisceral lipid storage disorder characterized by progressive and widespread neurodegeneration. Although some characteristic symptoms of NPC result from brainstem dysfunction, little information is available about which brainstem structures are affected. In this study, the brainstems of mutant BALB/c NPC1-/- mice with a retroposon insertion in the NPC1 gene were examined for neuropathological changes. In the midbrain, the integrated optic density (IOD) and cell count density of tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunostained neurons were decreased in the substantia nigra. In the pons, TH immunoreactivity in the locus ceruleus (LC) neurons was decreased, while the IOD and the neuronal density of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunostained neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus were preserved. The ChAT immunoreactivity of the hypoglossal nucleus (12N) neurons was not decreased, but Klüver-Barrera staining showed that neuronal density in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) was decreased. Klüver-Barrera and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining showed a decrease in neuronal density in the ventral cochlear nucleus, but not in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Gliosis was widely identified by GFAP staining in various brainstem structures, including the superior and inferior colliculi, the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the oculomotor complex, the medial geniculate nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, and the 12N. However, GFAP expression was not augmented in the LC, the cochlear nucleus, or the NTS. These neuropathological findings suggest a basis for the neurological syndromes observed in NPC, such as rigidity, oculomotor symptoms, cataplexy and sleep disturbance, dysphagia, and perceptive deafness.",M1

In the majority of NPC patients, mutations in the NPC1 gene can be identified. About 5% of patients show mutations in the NPC2 gene. Many different mutations can cause NPC disease and multiple variants not associated with the disease are known in both genes.

This article describes the use of computerized three-dimensional motion analysis to evaluate a 3-year-old child with NPC treated with miglustat for 12 months. Motion analysis provided quantitative data on the patient's gait. However, dementia and motor dysfunction progressed despite the treatment, and the patient lost the ability to walk between 9 and 12 months of the study.

17921694,"Autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Niemann-Pick Type C mice: lipid starvation or indigestion?Increasing evidence shows that autophagy, particularly macroautophagy, plays a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde role in determining cell fate; autophagic activity can be protective under certain conditions, whereas it may lead to cell death under others. Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is an early onset autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes. About 95% of the cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, whereas the remaining 5% are due to mutations in the NPC2 gene. Severe neurodegeneration that accompanies NPC is likely the fatal cause in this disease, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study shows that autophagic activity is enhanced in Npc1-/- mice, as evidenced by increased levels of LC3-II and the number of autophagic vacuole-like structures. Interestingly, LC3 immunoreactivity co-localizes with filipin-labeled cholesterol clusters inside Purkinje cells. Furthermore, increases in autophagic activity are closely associated with alteration in lysosomal function and protein ubiquitination. In this article, these results are further discussed in the context of autophagic-lysosomal function and neuronal survival and degeneration.",M1

Most studies on the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in NPC have focused on neurons. However, the possibility also exists that NPC1 affects neuronal functions indirectly by acting on other cells that are intimately interacting with neurons. In this study, using a heterotypic neuron-glia coculture system, we found that wild-type neurons cultured on a layer of NPC1-/- astrocytes showed decreased neurite growth compared with those cultured on wild-type astrocytes. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assessments showed significantly lower expression of neurosteroid enzymes and StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) in NPC1-/- astrocyte cultures than in wild-type cultures. Furthermore, a reduced level of estradiol was measured from both astrocyte culture medium and whole brains from NPC1-/- mice. Administration of 17beta-estradiol to neonatal NPC1-/- mice significantly delayed the onset of neurological symptoms, increased Purkinje cell survival, and extended the animals' life span. Our findings suggest that astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration of NPC and estradiol treatment may be useful in ameliorating progression of the disease.",M1
17689147,"Miglustat for treatment of Niemann-Pick C disease: a randomised controlled study.BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterised by an intracellular lipid-trafficking defect with secondary accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Miglustat, a small iminosugar, reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the first committed step of glycosphingolipid synthesis. Miglustat is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is thus a potential therapy for neurological diseases. We aimed to establish the effect of miglustat on several markers of NPC severity. METHODS: Patients aged 12 years or older who had NPC (n=29) were randomly assigned to receive either miglustat 200 mg three times a day (n=20) or standard care (n=9) for 12 months. 12 children younger than 12 years of age were included in an additional cohort; all received miglustat at a dose adjusted for body surface area. All participants were then treated with miglustat for an additional year in an extension study. The primary endpoint was horizontal saccadic eye movement (HSEM) velocity, based on its correlation with disease progression. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN26761144. FINDINGS: At 12 months, HSEM velocity had improved in patients treated with miglustat versus those receiving standard care; results were significant when patients taking benzodiazepines were excluded (p=0.028). Children showed an improvement in HSEM velocity of similar size at 12 months. Improvement in swallowing capacity, stable auditory acuity, and a slower deterioration in ambulatory index were also seen in treated patients older than 12 years. The safety and tolerability of miglustat 200 mg three times a day in study participants was consistent with previous trials in type I Gaucher disease, where half this dose was used. INTERPRETATION: Miglustat improves or stabilises several clinically relevant markers of NPC. This is the first agent studied in NPC for which there is both animal and clinical data supporting a disease modifying benefit.",M1

Thus, new and efficient drug targets are needed, and therefore we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on NPC and healthy fibroblasts to identify globally affected pathways in NPC that could serve as targets for later drug discovery programs. Cell lines were characterized by analyzing cellular concentrations of cholesterol, its precursors and metabolites, as well as cellular plant sterol levels. Gene expression analyses were performed with Sentrix Human-8 Expression BeadChips, analyzing 23,000 transcripts. Pathway analysis of the expression data was performed using the GSEA method. Twenty-seven upregulated and 33 downregulated pathways emerged as globally affected in the GSEA analysis. These pathways included, for example, mitochondrial pathway, caspase cascade, as well as prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism.

17611388,"Lipid trafficking defects increase Beclin-1 and activate autophagy in Niemann-Pick type C disease.Niemann-Pick type C disease (<e>NPC</e>) is a sphingolipid storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that typically shows juvenile onset. Mutations in the Npc1 gene cause approximately 95% of NPC cases. NPC1 is a multipass transmembrane protein involved in lipid and cholesterol trafficking. Loss of function mutations in Npc1 lead to the accumulation of sphingolipids and cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes. In our study, we demonstrated that NPC1 deficiency results in increased basal autophagy in human fibroblasts and in mice. We further demonstrated that NPC1 deficiency activate basal autophagy through increased expression of Beclin-1, a highly conserved member of the class III PI3K complex that is critical for the formation of autophagosomes. In contrast, enhanced basal autophagy was not associated with activation of the Akt-mTORp70 S6K signaling pathway. Increased Beclin-1 levels and elevated autophagy were also observed in other sphingolipid storage diseases characterized by disrupted cholesterol and sphingolipid trafficking. We propose a model in which the disordered cholesterol trafficking that occurs in many sphingolipid storages diseases results in upregulation of Beclin-1 and enhanced levels of autophagy.",M1
17499483,"Elevated small GTPase activation influences the cell proliferation signaling control in Niemann-Pick type C fibroblasts.Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is characterized at the cellular level by the intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol. We have previously identified a similar phenotype in cystic fibrosis (CF) cell models that results in the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. The hypothesis of this study was that NPC cells would also exhibit an increase in small GTPase activation. An examination of the active, GTP-bound form of GTPases revealed a basal increase in the content of the active-form Ras and RhoA small GTPases in NPC fibroblasts compared to wt controls. To assess whether this increase in GTP-bound Ras and RhoA manifests a functional outcome, the expression of the proliferation control proteins p21/waf1 and cyclin D were examined. Consistent with increased GTPase signaling, p21/waf1 expression is reduced and cyclin D expression is elevated in NPC fibroblasts. Interestingly, cell growth rate is not altered in NPC fibroblasts compared to wt cells. However, NPC sensitivity to statin treatment is reversed by addition of the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a modifier of RhoA. It is concluded that Ras and RhoA basal activation is elevated in NPC fibroblasts and has an impact on cell survival pathways.",M1

Uptake of LDL-cholesterol varied from 514 microg/day in the liver to zero in the central nervous system. In animals lacking LDL receptors, liver uptake remained about the same (411 microg/day), but more cholesterol was taken up in extrahepatic organs. This uptake was unaffected by the reductive methylation of LDL and consistent with bulk-phase endocytosis. All tissues accumulated cholesterol in mice lacking NPC1 function, but this accumulation was decreased in adrenal, unchanged in liver, and increased in organs like spleen and lung when LDL receptor function was also deleted. Over 56 days, the spleen and lung accumulated amounts of cholesterol greater than predicted, and these organs were heavily infiltrated with macrophages. This accumulation of both cholesterol and macrophages was increased by deleting LDL receptor function. These observations indicate that both receptor-mediated and bulk-phase endocytosis of lipoproteins, as well as macrophage infiltration, contribute to the cholesterol accumulation seen in NPC disease. These macrophages may also play a role in parenchymal cell death in this syndrome.",M1

We report the diagnosis of six unrelated patients with NPC2, all with homozygous mutations. We further attempted functional characterization of the p.P120S, p.Q146X and IVS1 + 2 t&gt;c mutations under native conditions. This was achieved by immunoblotting and immunocytofluorescence microscopy on cultured skin fibroblasts and in silico modeling. IVS1 + 2 t&gt;c led to multiple transcripts, with only abnormally spliced cDNAs. Among the three NPC2 variants, only p.P120S led to detectable amounts of an immunoreactive protein. This protein showed a normal lysosomal localization. Our results suggest that the p.P120S mutation, the first naturally occurring missense mutation located in the cholesterol-binding Evolutionarily Constrained Regions D domain, results in reduced amounts of a protein capable to reach the lysosome, but unable to efficiently bind cholesterol. The patient had a juvenile neurological onset form of the disease. An update of the 22 families with mutations in the NPC2 gene, currently known to us, confirms the good genotype-phenotype correlations seen in this disorder.

The association of known surface antigens with detergent resistant fraction of membranes (DRMs) was compared using monocytes from healthy blood donors, patients with genetic disorders affecting cellular cholesterol traffic and patients with systemic inflammatory response. RESULTS: All investigated surface antigens of Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>)-mutant monocytes with impaired cholesterol influx and defective late endosome cholesterol trafficking, presented a strongly increased DRM-association. Though, membrane antigens of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mutant monocytes with impaired cholesterol efflux did not show alterations in DRM-association. Differential CD14-dependent receptor clustering within microdomains was also investigated in response to in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or atherogenic lipoprotein activation. Increased DRM-association of the GPI-anchored proteins CD14, CD55, the Fcgamma receptor CD64, the scavenger receptors CD36, CD91 and CD163, the integrin CD11a, and complement receptor 3 complex CD11b/CD18 were observed from patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis or coronary artery disease (CAD)/myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the tetraspanin CD81 presented increased DRM-association in SIRS/sepsis patients, but not in CAD patients. Moreover, the pentaspanin CD47 and the Fcgamma RIII CD16 showed an increased DRM partition in CAD patients but disassembled from DRMs in SIRS/sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that flow cytometric analysis of short time in situ detergent extraction provides a powerful tool for rapid screening of blood monocyte DRMs to preselect patients with potential raft/microdomain abnormalities for more detailed analysis.",M1
17314284,"Endosomal accumulation of Toll-like receptor 4 causes constitutive secretion of cytokines and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription in Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) fibroblasts: a potential basis for glial cell activation in the NPC brain.Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an inherited lipid storage disorder caused by mutations in NPC1 or NPC2 genes. Loss of function of either protein results in the endosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids, progressive neurodegeneration, and robust glial cell activation. Here, we report that cultured human NPC fibroblasts secrete interferon-beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8, and contain increased levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). These cells also contained increased levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that accumulated in cholesterol-enriched endosomes/lysosomes, and small interfering RNA knockdown of this receptor reduced cytokine secretion. In the NPC1-/- mouse brain, glial cells expressed TLR4 and IL-6, whereas both glial and neuronal cells expressed STATs. Genetic deletion of TLR4 in NPC1-/- mice reduced IL-6 secretion by cultured fibroblasts but failed to alter STAT levels or glial cell activation in the brain. In contrast, genetic deletion of IL-6 normalized STAT levels and suppressed glial cell activation. These findings indicate that constitutive cytokine secretion leads to activation of STATs in NPC fibroblasts and that this secretion is partly caused by an endosomal accumulation of TLR4. These results also suggest that similar signaling events may underlie glial cell activation in the NPC1-/- mouse brain.",M1
17183645,"Clues to neuro-degeneration in Niemann-Pick type C disease from global gene expression profiling.BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick Type C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the late endocytic pathway. The majority of NPC cases are due to mutations in the NPC1 gene. The precise function of this gene is not yet known. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using cDNA microarrays, we analyzed the genome-wide expression patterns of human fibroblasts homozygous for the I1061T NPC1 mutation that is characterized by a severe defect in the intracellular processing of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. A distinct gene expression profile was identified in NPC fibroblasts from different individuals when compared with fibroblasts isolated from normal subjects. As expected, NPC1 mutant cells displayed an inappropriate homeostatic response to accumulated intracellular cholesterol. In addition, a number of striking parallels were observed between NPC disease and Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Many genes involved in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein and the microtubule binding protein, tau, were more highly expressed. Numerous genes important for membrane traffic and the cellular regulation of calcium, metals and other ions were upregulated. Finally, NPC fibroblasts exhibited a gene expression profile indicative of oxidative stress. These changes are likely contributors to the pathophysiology of Niemann-Pick Type C disease.",M1
17160617,"The natural history of Niemann-Pick disease type C in the UK.Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) is an autosomal recessive, neurovisceral lipid storage disorder. Mutations in two genes (NPC1 and NPC2) produce indistinguishable clinical phenotypes by biochemical mechanisms that have not yet been entirely clarified. The wide spectrum of clinical presentations of NPC includes hepatic and pulmonary disease as well as a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Late-onset disease has been increasingly recognized as the biochemical diagnosis of NPC has been more widely applied in adult neurology clinics. The clinical presentation and follow-up of 94 patients with NPC is described, 58 of whom were still alive at the time this report was prepared. The age at diagnosis ranged from the prenatal period (with hydrops fetalis) up to 51 years. This review of NPC patients in the UK confirms the phenotypic variability of this inherited lipid storage disorder reported elsewhere. Although a non-neuronopathic variant has been described, most patients in this series who survived childhood inevitably suffered neurological and in some cases neuropsychiatric deterioration. While symptomatic treatment, such as anticholinergic and antiepileptic drugs, can alleviate some aspects of the disease, there is a clear need to develop a specific treatment for this progressively debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.",M1
17156101,"Sterol, protein and lipid trafficking in Chinese hamster ovary cells with Niemann-Pick type C1 defect.We studied the trafficking of sterols, lipids and proteins in Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) cells. The NPC is an inherited disorder involving the accumulation of sterol and lipids in modified late-endosome/lysosome-like storage organelles. Most sterol accumulation studies in NPC cells have been carried out using low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the sterol source, and it has been shown that sterol efflux from late endosomes is impaired in NPC cells. In this study, we used a fluorescent sterol analog, dehydroergosterol, which can be quickly and efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane. Thus, we were able to study the trafficking kinetics of the non-LDL-derived sterol pool, and we found that dehydroergosterol accumulates in the storage organelles over the course of several hours in NPC cells. We also found that dialkylindocarbocyanine lipid-mimetic analogs that recycle efficiently from early endosomes in wild-type cells are targeted to late endosomal organelles in NPC cells, and transferrin receptors recycle slowly and inefficiently in NPC cells. These data are consistent with multiple trafficking defects in both early and late endosomes in NPC cells.",M1
17107950,"Lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein secretion in Niemann-Pick C1-deficient hepatocytes.Niemann-Pick C (<e>NPC</e>) disease is a fatal inherited disorder characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes. Although this disease is considered to be primarily a neurodegenerative disorder, many NPC patients suffer from liver disease. We have investigated alterations that occur in hepatic lipid homeostasis using primary hepatocytes isolated from NPC1-deficient mice. The cholesterol content of Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes was 5-fold higher than that of Npc1(+/+) hepatocytes; phospholipids and cholesteryl esters also accumulated. In contrast, the triacylglycerol content of Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes was 50% lower than of Npc1(+/+) hepatocytes. We hypothesized that the cholesterol sequestration induced by NPC1 deficiency might inhibit very low density lipoprotein secretion. However, this process was enhanced by NPC1 deficiency and the secreted particles were enriched in cholesteryl esters. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for these changes. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol in hepatocytes was increased by NPC1 deficiency and the amount of the mature form of sterol response element-binding protein-1 was also increased. These observations indicate that the enhanced secretion of lipoproteins from NPC1-deficient hepatocytes is due, at least in part, to increased lipid synthesis.",M1
17003072,"The adult form of Niemann-Pick disease type C.Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) is a fatal neurovisceral lipid storage disease of autosomal inheritance resulting from mutations in either the NPC1 (95% of families) or NPC2 gene. The encoded proteins appear to be involved in lysosomal/late endosomal transport of cholesterol, glycolipids and other molecules but their exact function is still unknown. The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. Based upon a comprehensive study of 13 unrelated adult patients diagnosed in France over the past 20 years as well as the analysis of the 55 other cases published since 1969, we have attempted to delineate the major clinical, radiological, biochemical and genotypic characteristics of adult NPC. Overall, mean age at onset (+/-SD) of neuropsychiatric symptoms was 25 +/- 9.7 years. The diagnosis of NPC was established after a mean delay of 6.2 +/- 6.4 years and the mean age at death (calculated from 20 cases) was 38 +/- 10.2 years. Major clinical features included cerebellar ataxia (76%), vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (VSO, 75%), dysarthria, (63%), cognitive troubles (61%), movement disorders (58%), splenomegaly (54%), psychiatric disorders (45%) and dysphagia (37%). Less frequent signs were epilepsy and cataplexy. During the course of the disease, clinical features could be subdivided into (i) visceral signs (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly), (ii) cortical signs (psychiatric cognitive disorders and epilepsy); and (iii) deep brain signs (VSO, ataxia, movement disorders, dysarthria, dysphagia, cataplexy) which exhibited different evolution patterns. Asymptomatic and non-evolutive visceral signs were often noticed since early childhood (38.5% of our patients), followed by mild cortical signs in childhood (learning difficulties) and early adulthood (62% of cases among which 38% were psychiatric disorders). Deep brain signs were observed in 96% of patients and were usually responsible for death. In general, there was a good correlation between clinical signs and the localization of brain atrophy on MRI. The 'variant' biochemical phenotype characterized by mild abnormalities of the cellular trafficking of endocytosed cholesterol was over-represented in the adult form of NPC and seemed associated with less frequent splenomegaly in childhood and lesser psychiatric signs. Involvement of the NPC1 gene was shown in 33 families and of the NPC2 gene in one. Improving the knowledge of the disease among psychiatrists and neurologists appears essential since emerging treatments should be more efficient at the visceral or cognitive/psychiatric stages of the disease, before the occurrence of widespread deep brain neurological lesions.",M1
16972172,"Critical assessment of chitotriosidase analysis in the rational laboratory diagnosis of children with Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease type A/B and C.Laboratory diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders, especially sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick disease type A/B) and Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) can be challenging. We therefore aimed to analyse the feasibility of first-step screening with specific chitotriosidase cut-off values in children &lt;/= 10 years of age with visceral organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or hepatosplenomegaly) in whom a storage disorder was suspected. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, referral, single-centre study to assess diagnostic test properties in 106 individuals. Median chitotriosidase activity was 12 655 nmol/h per ml (interquartile range 4693-20982) in Gaucher disease (GD); 780 (465-1298) in SMD (sphingomyelinase deficiency); 925 (319-1215) in NPC and 50 (29-54) in patients with miscellaneous diseases. To restrict the differential diagnosis to GD, SMD or NPC, chitotriosidase activity above 200 nmol/h per ml had a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95%. For GD alone, chitotriosidase activity above 4000 nmol/h per ml had a sensitivity of 77%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100% and NPV of 92%. Of the 44 patients analysed, 4.5% were homozygous and 36.4% heterozygous for chitotriosidase gene duplication. Adjusting for the chitotriosidase genotype, chitotriosidase activities were higher in GD type III than in GD type I. We conclude that, in the above setting, the degree of elevation of chitotriosidase activity can be applied to increase the likelihood of GD, SMD, or NPC and guide the choice of the appropriate confirmatory assay.",M1
16802107,"Subclinical course of adult visceral Niemann-Pick type C1 disease. A rare or underdiagnosed disorder?We present the third case of Niemann-Pick disease type C without neurological symptoms. The patient was a 53-year-old woman without significant prior health problems who died of acute pulmonary embolism. Autopsy findings of hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and ceroid-rich foam cells raised the suspicion of the visceral form of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick disease type B; NPB) or a much rarer disorder, variant adult visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>). To verify the histopathological findings, SMPD1, NPC1 and NPC2 genes were analysed. Two novel sequence variants, c.1997G&gt;A (S666N) and c.2882A&gt;G (N961S) were detected in the NPC1 gene. No pathogenic sequence variants were found either in the SMPD1 gene mutated in NPB or in NPC2 gene. The pathogenicity of both NPC1 variants was supported by their location in regions important for the protein function. Both variations were not found in more than 300 control alleles. Identified sequence variations confirm the diagnosis of the extremely rare adult visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease type C, which is otherwise dominated by neurovisceral symptoms. Although only three patients have been reported, this (most probably underdiagnosed) form of NPC should be considered in differential diagnosis of isolated hepatosplenomegaly with foam cells in adulthood.",M1
16797161,"Cellular mechanism of U18666A-mediated apoptosis in cultured murine cortical neurons: bridging Niemann-Pick disease type C and Alzheimer's disease.Neuronal cell death can occur by means of either necrosis or apoptosis. Both necrosis and apoptosis are generally believed to be distinct mechanisms of cell death with different characteristic features distinguished on the basis of their morphological and biochemical properties. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body but not much is known about the mechanisms that regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. Recently, several clinical and biochemical studies suggest that cholesterol imbalance in the brain may be a risk factor related to the development of neurological disorders such as Niemann-Pick disease type C (<e>NPC</e>) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). NPC is a fatal juvenile neurodegenerative disorder characterized by premature neuronal death and somatically altered cholesterol metabolism. The main biochemical manifestation in NPC is elevated intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol caused by a genetic deficit in cholesterol trafficking. The pharmacological agent, U18666A (3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one), is a well-known class-2 amphiphile which inhibits cholesterol transport. Cells treated with this agent accumulate intracellular cholesterol to massive levels, similar to that observed in cells from NPC patients. NPC and AD have some pathological similarities which may share a common underlying cause. AD is one of the most common types of dementia affecting the elderly. However, the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in NPC and AD are largely unknown. This review provides a consolidation of work done using U18666A in the past half century and focuses on the implications of our research findings on the mechanism of U18666A-mediated neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons, which may provide an insight to elucidate the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly NPC and AD, where apoptosis might occur through a similar mechanism.",M1

Electroencephalographic (EEG) -polymyographic examinations showed abnormally high and diffuse background alpha-activity, enhanced by intermittent photic stimulation. The electromyographic (EMG) showed quasirhythmic myoclonic jerks during motor activation. EEG-EMG frequency analysis (better than jerk-locked back-averaging) demonstrated the cortical origin of the myoclonus. Our observations indicate that cortical myoclonus may occur as the main symptom of NPC.",M1
16734766,"Regulation of the cell swelling-activated chloride conductance by cholesterol-rich membrane domains.AIM: The role of high cholesterol-containing microdomains in the signal transduction cascade leading to the activation of volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) was studied. METHODS: Osmotic cell swelling-induced efflux of 125I- was determined in human epithelial Intestine 407 cells and in skin fibroblasts obtained from healthy controls or Niemann-Pick type C (<e>NPC</e>) patients. Cellular cholesterol content was modulated by pre-incubation with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in the presence of acceptor lipid vesicles. RESULTS: Osmotic cell swelling of human Intestine 407 cells leads to the rapid activation of a compensatory anion conductance. Treatment of the cells with cyclodextrin enhanced the response to submaximal hypotonic stimulation by approx. twofold, but did not further increase the efflux elicited by a saturating stimulus. In contrast, the volume-sensitive anion efflux was markedly inhibited when cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin was used. Potentiation of the response by cholesterol depletion was maintained in caveolin-1 deficient Caco-2 colonocytes as well as in sphingomyelinase-treated Intestine 407 cells, indicating that cholesterol-rich microdomains are not crucially involved. However, treatment of the cells with progesterone, an inhibitor of NPC1-dependent endosomal cholesterol trafficking, not only markedly reduced the hypotonicity-provoked anion efflux, but also prevented its potentiation by cyclodextrin. In addition, the volume-sensitive anion efflux from human NPC skin fibroblasts was significantly smaller when compared with control fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The results support a model of regulatory volume decrease involving recruitment of volume-sensitive anion channels from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane.",M1
20550937,"Cell cycle-dependent differences in nuclear pore complex assembly in metazoa.In metazoa, nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) assemble from disassembled precursors into a reforming nuclear envelope (NE) at the end of mitosis and into growing intact NEs during interphase. Here, we show via RNAi-mediated knockdown that ELYS, a nucleoporin critical for the recruitment of the essential Nup107/160 complex to chromatin, is required for NPC assembly at the end of mitosis but not during interphase. Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Strikingly, recruitment of the Nup107/160 complex to an intact NE involves a membrane curvature-sensing domain of its constituent Nup133, which is not required for postmitotic NPC formation. Our results suggest that in organisms with open mitosis, NPCs assemble via two distinct mechanisms to accommodate cell cycle-dependent differences in NE topology.",M2
20498018,"Pom33, a novel transmembrane nucleoporin required for proper nuclear pore complex distribution.The biogenesis of nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) represents a paradigm for the assembly of high-complexity macromolecular structures. So far, only three integral pore membrane proteins are known to function redundantly in NPC anchoring within the nuclear envelope. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of Pom33, a novel transmembrane protein dynamically associated with budding yeast NPCs. Pom33 becomes critical for yeast viability in the absence of a functional Nup84 complex or Ndc1 interaction network, which are two core NPC subcomplexes, and associates with the reticulon Rtn1. Moreover, POM33 loss of function impairs NPC distribution, a readout for a subset of genes required for pore biogenesis, including members of the Nup84 complex and RTN1. Consistently, we show that Pom33 is required for normal NPC density in the daughter nucleus and for proper NPC biogenesis and/or stability in the absence of Nup170. We hypothesize that, by modifying or stabilizing the nuclear envelope-NPC interface, Pom33 may contribute to proper distribution and/or efficient assembly of nuclear pores.",M2
20453848,"Dynamics of single mRNP nucleocytoplasmic transport and export through the nuclear pore in living cells.The flow of genetic information in eukaryotic cells occurs through the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of mRNAs. Knowledge of in vivo messenger RNA export kinetics remains poor in comparison with that of protein transport. We have established a mammalian system that allowed the real-time visualization and quantification of large single mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) during export. The in vivo dynamics of bulk mRNP transport and export, from transcription to the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>), occurred within a 5-40 minute time frame, with no NPC pile-up. mRNP export was rapid (about 0.5 s) and kinetically faster than nucleoplasmic diffusion. Export inhibition demonstrated that mRNA-NPC interactions were independent of ongoing export. Nucleoplasmic transport dynamics of intron-containing and intronless mRNAs were similar, yet an intron did increase export efficiency. Here we provide visualization and analysis at the single mRNP level of the various steps in nuclear gene expression and the inter-chromatin tracks through which mRNPs diffuse, and demonstrate the kinetics of mRNP-NPC interactions and translocation.",M2
20421988,"Charge as a selection criterion for translocation through the nuclear pore complex.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are highly selective filters that control the exchange of material between nucleus and cytoplasm. The principles that govern selective filtering by NPCs are not fully understood. Previous studies find that cellular proteins capable of fast translocation through NPCs (transport receptors) are characterized by a high proportion of hydrophobic surface regions. Our analysis finds that transport receptors and their complexes are also highly negatively charged. Moreover, NPC components that constitute the permeability barrier are positively charged. We estimate that electrostatic interactions between a transport receptor and the NPC result in an energy gain of several k(B)T, which would enable significantly increased translocation rates of transport receptors relative to other cellular proteins. We suggest that negative charge is an essential criterion for selective passage through the NPC.",M2
20409487,"Probing a structural model of the nuclear pore complex channel through molecular dynamics.The central pore of a nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) is filled with unstructured proteins that contain many FG-repeats separated by hydrophilic regions. An example of such protein is nsp1. By simulating an array of nsp1 segments, we identified, in an earlier study, a spontaneously formed brushlike structure that promises to explain selective transport in the NPC channel. Here we report four (350,000 atom, 200 ns) simulations probing this structure via its interaction with transport receptor NTF2 as well as with an inert protein. NTF2 dimers are observed to gradually enter the brush, but the inert protein is not. Both NTF2 and the inert protein are found to bind to FG-repeats, but binding periods lasted more briefly for the inert protein. A simulation also investigated the behavior of a brush made of mutant nsp1 that is known to be less effective in NPC-selective transport, finding that this brush does not attract NTF2.",M2
20371601,"Control of mRNA export and translation termination by inositol hexakisphosphate requires specific interaction with Gle1.The unidirectional translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) through the aqueous channel of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) is mediated by interactions between soluble mRNA export factors and distinct binding sites on the NPC. At the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, the conserved mRNA export factors Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) play an essential role in mRNA export by activating the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, promoting localized messenger ribonucleoprotein complex remodeling, and ensuring the directionality of the export process. In addition, Dbp5, Gle1, and IP(6) are also required for proper translation termination. However, the specificity of the IP(6)-Gle1 interaction in vivo is unknown. Here, we characterize the biochemical interaction between Gle1 and IP(6) and the relationship to Dbp5 binding and stimulation. We identify Gle1 residues required for IP(6) binding and show that these residues are needed for IP(6)-dependent Dbp5 stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gle1 is the primary target of IP(6) for both mRNA export and translation termination in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the IP(6)-binding mutants recapitulate all of the mRNA export and translation termination defects found in mutants depleted of IP(6). We conclude that Gle1 specifically binds IP(6) and that this interaction is required for the full potentiation of Dbp5 ATPase activity during both mRNA export and translation termination.",M2
20368455,"Three-dimensional distribution of transient interactions in the nuclear pore complex obtained from single-molecule snapshots.The translocation of large macromolecules through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) of eukaryotic cells is hindered by the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporin (Nup) barrier unless molecules are chaperoned by transport receptors. The precise mechanism of facilitated translocation remains unclear due to the challenges of measuring the series of transient interactions between a transport receptor and the FG-Nups. This study developed single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction microscopy to obtain a three-dimensional density map of the transient interactions with a spatiotemporal resolution of 9 nm and 400 mus. Three unique features were observed under real-time trafficking conditions that have escaped detection by conventional electron microscopy: (i) the spatial density of interaction sites between Importin beta1 (Imp beta1, a major transport receptor) and the FG-Nups gradually increases from both sides of the NPC and is highest in the central pore region; (ii) cargo-free or cargo-bound Imp beta1 rarely occupies an axial channel with a diameter of approximately 10-20 nm at its narrowest point through the NPC; and (iii) the pathway of facilitated translocation through the NPC depends more on the interaction sites of the FG-Nups than on the NPC architecture.",M2
20348449,"Ecm1 is a new pre-ribosomal factor involved in pre-60S particle export.In eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis is a highly conserved process that starts in the nucleus and ends in the cytoplasm. In actively growing yeast cells, it is estimated that each nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) contributes to the export of about 25 pre-ribosomal particles per minute. Such an extremely active process requires several redundant export receptors for the pre-60S particles. Here, we report the identification of a novel pre-60S factor, Ecm1, which partially acts like Arx1 and becomes essential when the NPC function is affected. Ecm1 depletion, combined with the deletion of NPC components led to pre-60S retention in the nucleus. Functional links that we identified between Ecm1, 60S biogenesis, pre-60S export, and the NPC were correlated with physical interactions of Ecm1 with pre-60S particles and nucleoporins. These results support that Ecm1 is an additional factor involved in pre-60S export. While Ecm1 and Arx1 have redundant functions, overproduction of either one could not complement the absence of the other, whereas overproduction of Mex67 was able to partially restore the growth defect resulting from the absence of Ecm1 or Arx1. These data highlight the involvement of many factors acting together to export pre-60S particles.",M2
20197273,"The importin beta binding domain modulates the avidity of importin beta for the nuclear pore complex.Importin beta mediates active passage of cellular substrates through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). Adaptors such as importin alpha and snurportin associate with importin beta via an importin beta binding (IBB) domain. The intrinsic structural flexibility of importin beta allows its concerted interactions with IBB domains, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins, and the GTPase Ran during transport. In this paper, we provide evidence that the nature of the IBB domain modulates the affinity of the import complex for the NPC. In permeabilized cells, importin beta imports a cargo fused to the snurportin IBB (sIBB) with approximately 70% reduced energy requirement as compared with the classical importin alpha IBB. At the molecular level, this is explained by approximately 200-fold reduced affinity of importin beta for Nup62, when bound to the sIBB. Consistently, in vivo, the importin beta.sIBB complex has greatly reduced persistence inside the central channel of the NPC. We propose that by controlling the degree of strain in the tertiary structure of importin beta, the IBB domain modulates the affinity of the import complex for nucleoporins, thus dictating its persistence inside the NPC.",M2
20132544,"Origin of the cell nucleus, mitosis and sex: roles of intracellular coevolution.BACKGROUND: The transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes was the most radical change in cell organisation since life began, with the largest ever burst of gene duplication and novelty. According to the coevolutionary theory of eukaryote origins, the fundamental innovations were the concerted origins of the endomembrane system and cytoskeleton, subsequently recruited to form the cell nucleus and coevolving mitotic apparatus, with numerous genetic eukaryotic novelties inevitable consequences of this compartmentation and novel DNA segregation mechanism. Physical and mutational mechanisms of origin of the nucleus are seldom considered beyond the long-standing assumption that it involved wrapping pre-existing endomembranes around chromatin. Discussions on the origin of sex typically overlook its association with protozoan entry into dormant walled cysts and the likely simultaneous coevolutionary, not sequential, origin of mitosis and meiosis. RESULTS: I elucidate nuclear and mitotic coevolution, explaining the origins of dicer and small centromeric RNAs for positionally controlling centromeric heterochromatin, and how 27 major features of the cell nucleus evolved in four logical stages, making both mechanisms and selective advantages explicit: two initial stages (origin of 30 nm chromatin fibres, enabling DNA compaction; and firmer attachment of endomembranes to heterochromatin) protected DNA and nascent RNA from shearing by novel molecular motors mediating vesicle transport, division, and cytoplasmic motility. Then octagonal nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) arguably evolved from COPII coated vesicle proteins trapped in clumps by Ran GTPase-mediated cisternal fusion that generated the fenestrated nuclear envelope, preventing lethal complete cisternal fusion, and allowing passive protein and RNA exchange. Finally, plugging NPC lumens by an FG-nucleoporin meshwork and adopting karyopherins for nucleocytoplasmic exchange conferred compartmentation advantages. These successive changes took place in naked growing cells, probably as indirect consequences of the origin of phagotrophy. The first eukaryote had 1-2 cilia and also walled resting cysts; I outline how encystation may have promoted the origin of meiotic sex. I also explain why many alternative ideas are inadequate. CONCLUSION: Nuclear pore complexes are evolutionary chimaeras of endomembrane- and mitosis-related chromatin-associated proteins. The keys to understanding eukaryogenesis are a proper phylogenetic context and understanding organelle coevolution: how innovations in one cell component caused repercussions on others.",M2
20098417,"DNA zip codes control an ancient mechanism for gene targeting to the nuclear periphery.Many genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are recruited to the nuclear periphery after transcriptional activation. We have identified two gene recruitment sequences (GRS I and II) from the promoter of the INO1 gene that target the gene to the nuclear periphery. These GRSs function as DNA zip codes and are sufficient to target a nucleoplasmic locus to the nuclear periphery. Targeting requires components of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) and a GRS is sufficient to confer a physical interaction with the NPC. GRS I elements are enriched in promoters of genes that interact with the NPC, and genes that are induced by protein folding stress. Full transcriptional activation of INO1 and another GRS-containing gene requires GRS-mediated targeting of the promoter to the nuclear periphery. Finally, GRS I also functions as a DNA zip code in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that this mechanism of targeting to the nuclear periphery has been conserved over approximately one billion years of evolution.",M2
20081840,"The Nup107-160 complex and gamma-TuRC regulate microtubule polymerization at kinetochores.The metazoan nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) disassembles during mitosis, and many of its constituents distribute onto spindles and kinetochores, including the Nup107-160 sub-complex. We have found that Nup107-160 interacts with the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC), an essential and conserved microtubule nucleator, and recruits gamma-TuRC to unattached kinetochores. The unattached kinetochores nucleate microtubules in a manner that is regulated by Ran GTPase; such microtubules contribute to the formation of kinetochore fibres (k-fibres), microtubule bundles connecting kinetochores to spindle poles. Our data indicate that Nup107-160 and gamma-TuRC act cooperatively to promote spindle assembly through microtubule nucleation at kinetochores: HeLa cells lacking Nup107-160 or gamma-TuRC were profoundly deficient in kinetochore-associated microtubule nucleation. Moreover, co-precipitated Nup107-160- gamma-TuRC complexes nucleated microtubule formation in assays using purified tubulin. Although Ran did not regulate microtubule nucleation by gamma-TuRC alone, Nup107-160-gamma-TuRC complexes required Ran-GTP for microtubule nucleation. Collectively, our observations show that Nup107-160 promotes spindle assembly through Ran-GTP-regulated nucleation of microtubules by gamma-TuRC at kinetochores, and reveal a relationship between nucleoporins and the microtubule cytoskeleton.",M2
20016074,"Integral membrane proteins Brr6 and Apq12 link assembly of the nuclear pore complex to lipid homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Apq12, a nuclear envelope (NE)-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integral membrane protein, are defective in assembly of nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>), possibly because of defects in regulating membrane fluidity. We identified BRR6, which encodes an essential integral membrane protein of the NE-ER, as a dosage suppressor of apq12 Delta. Cells carrying the temperature-sensitive brr6-1 allele have been shown to have defects in nucleoporin localization, mRNA metabolism and nuclear transport. Electron microscopy revealed that brr6-1 cells have gross NE abnormalities and proliferation of the ER. brr6-1 cells were hypersensitive to compounds that affect membrane biophysical properties and to inhibitors of lipid biosynthetic pathways, and displayed strong genetic interactions with genes encoding non-essential lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Strikingly, brr6-1 cells accumulated, in or near the NE, elevated levels of the two classes of neutral lipids, steryl esters and triacylglycerols, and over-accumulated sterols when they were provided exogenously. Although neutral lipid synthesis is dispensable in wild-type cells, viability of brr6-1 cells was fully dependent on neutral lipid production. These data indicate that Brr6 has an essential function in regulating lipid homeostasis in the NE-ER, thereby impacting NPC formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport.",M2
19947544,"[Conservative E(y)2/Sus1 protein is the member of SAGA complex and new nuclear pore-associated complex in Drosophila]The SGA/TFTC complex plays an important role in the regulation of transcription. We have examined the significance of the gene positioning in the nucleus for its transcription and subsequent export of nascent mRNA. It was demonstrated that E(y)2 protein was a subunit of the SAGA/TFTC histone acetyl transferase complex in Drosophila and that E(y)2 concentrated at the nuclear periphery. An interaction between E(y)2 and the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) was demonstrated, as well as that SAGA/TFTC also contacted the NPC at nuclear periphery. In addition, it was shown that E(y)2 formed complex with the Xmas-2 protein (X-linked male sterile 2) both in normal conditions and after heat shock. Importantly, the E(y)2 and Xmas-2 knockdown decreased the contact between the heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene loci and the nuclear envelope before and after activation, and interfered with the transcription. Thus, E(y)2 and Xmas-2 together with SAGA/TFTC functioned in the anchoring of a subset of transcription sites to the NPCs to achieve efficient transcription and mRNA export.",M2
19913035,"Structural analysis of a metazoan nuclear pore complex reveals a fused concentric ring architecture.The sole gateway for molecular exchange between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). This large supramolecular assembly mediates transport of cargo into and out of the nucleus and fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form an aqueous translocation channel. The NPC is composed of eight proteinaceous asymmetric units forming a pseudo-8-fold symmetric passage. Due to its shear size, complexity, and plastic nature, dissecting the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the NPC in its hydrated state is a formidable challenge. Toward this goal, we applied cryo-electron tomography to spread nuclear envelopes from Xenopus oocytes. To compensate for perturbations of the 8-fold symmetry of individual NPCs, we performed symmetry-independent asymmetric unit averaging of three-dimensional tomographic NPC volumes to eventually yield a refined model at 6.4 nm resolution. This approach revealed novel structural features, particularly in the spoke-ring complex and luminal domains. Fused concentric ring architecture of the spoke-ring complex was found along the translocation channel. Additionally, a comparison of the refined Xenopus model to that of its Dictyostelium homologue yielded similar pore diameters at the level of the three canonical rings, although the Xenopus NPC was found to be 30% taller than the Dictyostelium pore. This discrepancy is attributed primarily to the relatively low homology and different organization of some nucleoporins in the Dictyostelium genome as compared to that of vertebrates. Nevertheless, the experimental conditions impose a preferred axial orientation of the NPCs within spread Xenopus oocyte nuclear envelopes. This may at least in part explain the increased height of the reconstructed vertebrate NPCs compared to those obtained from tomographic reconstruction of intact Dictyostelium nuclei.",M2
19875325,"Adding pieces to the puzzling plant nuclear envelope.The nuclear envelope (NE) and the nuclear pores are important structures that both separate and selectively connect the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. NE and nuclear pore research in plants have recently seen an elevated level of interest. This is based both on new findings demonstrating the importance of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking for several signal transduction events, and on increasing evidence that NE and nuclear pore components play important roles during plant cell division. Here, we review the most recent reports in the field and compare them to the more advanced knowledge about yeast and animal model systems. They deal with the refined ultrastructure of the NE and <e>NPC</e>, with the discovery of novel NE components, and, importantly, with novel roles and fates of NE-associated and NPC-associated proteins during plant mitosis and cytokinesis.",M2
19855394,"Molecular architecture of the Nup84-Nup145C-Sec13 edge element in the nuclear pore complex lattice.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) facilitate all nucleocytoplasmic transport. These massive protein assemblies are modular, with a stable structural scaffold supporting more dynamically attached components. The scaffold is made from multiple copies of the heptameric Y complex and the heteromeric Nic96 complex. We previously showed that members of these core subcomplexes specifically share an ACE1 fold with Sec31 of the COPII vesicle coat, and we proposed a lattice model for the NPC based on this commonality. Here we present the crystal structure of the heterotrimeric 134-kDa complex of Nup84-Nup145C-Sec13 of the Y complex. The heterotypic ACE1 interaction of Nup84 and Nup145C is analogous to the homotypic ACE1 interaction of Sec31 that forms COPII lattice edge elements and is inconsistent with the alternative 'fence-like' NPC model. We construct a molecular model of the Y complex and compare the architectural principles of COPII and NPC lattices.",M2
19853599,"Exclusion of mRNPs and ribosomal particles from a thin zone beneath the nuclear envelope revealed upon inhibition of transport.We have studied the nucleocytoplasmic transport of a specific messenger RNP (mRNP) particle, named Balbiani ring (BR) granule, and ribosomal RNP (rRNP) particles in the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans. The passage of the RNPs through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) was inhibited with the nucleoporin-binding wheat germ agglutinin, and the effects were examined by electron microscopy. BR mRNPs bound to the nuclear basket increased in number, while BR mRNPs translocating through the central channel decreased, suggesting that the initiation of translocation proper had been inhibited. The rRNPs accumulated heavily in nucleoplasm, while no or very few rRNPs were recorded within nuclear baskets. Thus, the transport of rRNPs had been blocked prior to the entry into the baskets. Remarkably, the rRNPs had been excluded both from baskets and the space in between the baskets. We propose that normally basket fibrils move freely and repel RNPs from the exclusion zone unless the particles have affinity for and bind to nucleoporins within the baskets.",M2
19843449,"Spatial distribution and mobility of the Ran GTPase in live interphase cells.The GTPase Ran is a key regulator of molecular transport through nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) channels. To analyze the role of Ran in its nuclear transport function, we used several quantitative fluorescence techniques to follow the distribution and dynamics of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-Ran in HeLa cells. The diffusion coefficient of the majority of EYFP-Ran molecules throughout the cells corresponded to an unbound state, revealing the remarkably dynamic Ran regulation. Although we observed no significant immobile Ran populations in cells, approximately 10% of the cytoplasmic EYFP-Ran and 30% of the nuclear EYFP-Ran exhibited low mobility indicative of molecular interactions. The high fraction of slow nuclear EYFP-Ran reflects the expected numerous interactions of nuclear RanGTP with nuclear transport receptors. However, it is not high enough to support retention mechanisms as the main cause for the observed nuclear accumulation of Ran. The highest cellular concentration of EYFP-Ran was detected at the nuclear envelope, corresponding to approximately 200 endogenous Ran molecules for each NPC, and exceeding the currently estimated NPC channel transport capacity. Together with the relatively long residence time of EYFP-Ran at the nuclear envelope (33 +/- 14 ms), these observations suggest that only a fraction of the Ran concentrated at NPCs transits through NPC channels.",M2
19843313,"Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast TREX-2 mRNA export complex: components and anchoring nucleoporin.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are vital to nuclear-cytoplasmic communication in eukaryotes. The yeast NPC-associated TREX-2 complex, also known as the Thp1-Sac3-Cdc31-Sus1 complex, is anchored on the NPC via the nucleoporin Nup1, and is essential for mRNA export. Here we report the identification and characterization of the putative Arabidopsis thaliana TREX-2 complex and its anchoring nucleoporin. Physical and functional evidence support the identification of the Arabidopsis orthologs of yeast Thp1 and Nup1. Of three Arabidopsis homologs of yeast Sac3, two are putative TREX-2 components, but, surprisingly, none are required for mRNA export as they are in yeast. Physical association of the two Cdc31 homologs, but not the Sus1 homolog, with the TREX-2 complex was observed. In addition to identification of these TREX-2 components, direct interactions of the Arabidopsis homolog of DSS1, which is an established proteasome component in yeast and animals, with both the TREX-2 complex and the proteasome were observed. This suggests the possibility of a link between the two complexes. Thus this work has identified the putative Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex and provides a foundation for future studies of nuclear export in Arabidopsis.",M2
19819881,"Influence of heart failure on nucleocytoplasmic transport in human cardiomyocytes.AIMS: The role of the cell nucleus in the development of heart failure (HF) is unknown, so the objectives of this study were to analyse the effect of HF on nucleocytoplasmic transport and density of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 51 human heart samples from ischaemic (ICM, n = 30) and dilated (DCM, n = 16) patients undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (CNT, n = 5) were analysed by western blotting. Subcellular distribution of proteins and NPC were analysed by fluorescence and electron microscopy, respectively. When we compared nucleocytoplasmic machinery protein levels according to aetiology of HF, ICM showed higher levels of importins [(IMP-beta3) (150%, P &lt; 0.0001), IMP-alpha2 (69%, P = 0.001)] and exportins [EXP-1 (178%, P &lt; 0.0001), EXP-4 (81%, P = 0.006)] than those of the CNT group. Furthermore, DCM also showed significant differences for IMP-beta3 (192%, P &lt; 0.0001), IMP-alpha2 (52%, P = 0.025), and EXP-1 (228%, P &lt; 0.0001). RanGTPase-activating proteins (RanGAP1 and RaGAP1u) were increased in ICM (76%, P = 0.005; 51%, P = 0.012) and DCM (41%, P = 0.042; 50%, P = 0.029). Furthermore, subcellular distribution of nucleocytoplasmic machinery was not altered in pathological hearts. Finally, nucleoporin (Nup) p62 was increased in ICM (80%) and DCM (109%) (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.024). Nuclear pore density was comparable in pathological and CNT hearts, and ICM showed a low diameter (P = 0.005) and different structural configuration of NPC. CONCLUSION: This study shows the effect of HF on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking machinery, evidenced by higher levels of importins, exportins, Ran regulators and Nup p62 in ischaemic and dilated human hearts than those in the controls, with NPCs acquiring a different configuration and morphology in ICM.",M2
19761539,"Transportin mediates nuclear entry of DNA in vertebrate systems.Delivery of DNA to the cell nucleus is an essential step in many types of viral infection, transfection, gene transfer by the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and in strategies for gene therapy. Thus, the mechanism by which DNA crosses the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) is of great interest. Using nuclei reconstituted in vitro in Xenopus egg extracts, we previously studied DNA passage through the nuclear pores using a single-molecule approach based on optical tweezers. Fluorescently labeled DNA molecules were also seen to accumulate within nuclei. Here we find that this import of DNA relies on a soluble protein receptor of the importin family. To identify this receptor, we used different pathway-specific cargoes in competition studies as well as pathway-specific dominant negative inhibitors derived from the nucleoporin Nup153. We found that inhibition of the receptor transportin suppresses DNA import. In contrast, inhibition of importin beta has little effect on the nuclear accumulation of DNA. The dependence on transportin was fully confirmed in assays using permeabilized HeLa cells and a mammalian cell extract. We conclude that the nuclear import of DNA observed in these different vertebrate systems is largely mediated by the receptor transportin. We further report that histones, a known cargo of transportin, can act as an adaptor for the binding of transportin to DNA.",M2
19759143,"Ty3 nuclear entry is initiated by viruslike particle docking on GLFG nucleoporins.Yeast retrotransposons form intracellular particles within which replication occurs. Because fungal nuclear membranes do not break down during mitosis, similar to retroviruses infecting nondividing cells, the cDNA produced must be translocated through nuclear pore complexes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat retrotransposon Ty3 assembles its Gag3 and Gag3-Pol3 precursor polyproteins into viruslike particles in association with perinuclear P-body foci. These perinuclear clusters of Ty3 viruslike particles localized to sites of clustered nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) in a nup120Delta mutant, indicating that Ty3 particles and NPCs interact physically. The NPC channels are lined with nucleoporins (Nups) with extended FG (Phe-Gly) motif repeat domains, further classified as FG, FxFG, or GLFG repeat types. These domains mediate partitioning of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Here we have systematically examined the requirements for FG repeat domains in Ty3 nuclear transport. The GLFG domains interacted in vitro with virus-like particle Gag3, and this interaction was disrupted by mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Gag3, which is predicted to lie on the external surface of the particles. Accordingly, Ty3 transposition was decreased in strains with the GLFG repeats deleted. The spacer-nucleocapsid domain of Gag3, which is predicted to be internal to the particle, interacted with GLFG repeats and nucleocapsid localized to the nucleus. We conclude that Ty3 particle docking on nuclear pores is facilitated by interactions between Gag3 and GLFG Nups and that nuclear entry of the preintegration complex is further promoted by nuclear localization signals within the nucleocapsid and integrase.",M2
19748337,"The nuclear pore complex has entered the atomic age.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) perforate the nuclear envelope and represent the exclusive passageway into and out of the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. Apart from their essential transport function, components of the NPC have important, direct roles in nuclear organization and in gene regulation. Because of its central role in cell biology, it is of considerable interest to determine the NPC structure at atomic resolution. The complexity of these large, 40-60 MDa protein assemblies has for decades limited such structural studies. More recently, exploiting the intrinsic modularity of the NPC, structural biologists are making progress toward understanding this nanomachine in molecular detail. Structures of building blocks of the stable, architectural scaffold of the NPC have been solved, and distinct models for their assembly proposed.

19730674,"Global motions of the nuclear pore complex: insights from elastic network models.The nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) is the gate to the nucleus. Recent determination of the configuration of proteins in the yeast NPC at approximately 5 nm resolution permits us to study the NPC global dynamics using coarse-grained structural models. We investigate these large-scale motions by using an extended elastic network model (ENM) formalism applied to several coarse-grained representations of the NPC. Two types of collective motions (global modes) are predicted by the ENMs to be intrinsically favored by the NPC architecture: global bending and extension/contraction from circular to elliptical shapes. These motions are shown to be robust against tested variations in the representation of the NPC, and are largely captured by a simple model of a toroid with axially varying mass density. We demonstrate that spoke multiplicity significantly affects the accessible number of symmetric low-energy modes of motion; the NPC-like toroidal structures composed of 8 spokes have access to highly cooperative symmetric motions that are inaccessible to toroids composed of 7 or 9 spokes. The analysis reveals modes of motion that may facilitate macromolecular transport through the NPC, consistent with previous experimental observations.",M2
19729515,"Nuclear myosin 1 is in complex with mature rRNA transcripts and associates with the nuclear pore basket.In rRNA biogenesis, nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) and actin synergize to activate rRNA gene transcription. Evidence that actin is in preribosomal subunits and NM1 may control rRNA biogenesis post-transcriptionally prompted us to investigate whether NM1 associates with and accompanies rRNA to nuclear pores (<e>NPC</e>). Ultracentrifugation on HeLa nucleolar extracts showed RNA-dependent NM1 coelution with preribosomal subunits. In RNA immunoprecipitations (RIPs), NM1 coprecipitated with pre-rRNAs and 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs, but failed to precipitate 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA. In isolated nuclei and living HeLa cells, NM1 or actin inhibition and selective alterations in actin polymerization impaired 36S pre-rRNA processing. Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) on sections of manually isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei showed NM1 localization at the NPC basket. Field emission scanning IEM on isolated nuclear envelopes and intranuclear content confirmed basket localization and showed that NM1 decorates actin-rich pore-linked filaments. Finally, RIP and successive RIPs (reRIPs) on cross-linked HeLa cells demonstrated that NM1, CRM1, and Nup153 precipitate same 18S and 28S rRNAs but not 5S rRNA. We conclude that NM1 facilitates maturation and accompanies export-competent preribosomal subunits to the NPC, thus modulating export.",M2
19713973,"Alteration of the nuclear pore complex in Ca(2+)-mediated cell death.Cell death requires coordinated intracellular signalling before disassembly of cell architecture by degradative enzymes. Although the death signalling cascades that involve the mitochondria, the ER and the plasma membrane have been extensively characterized, only a handful of studies have examined the functional and structural alterations of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) during neuronal death. Here, we show that during excitotoxic neuronal degeneration calpains redistributed across the nuclear envelope and mediated the degradation of NPC components causing altered permeability of the nuclear membrane. In primary dissociated neurons, simultaneous recording of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and localization of fluorescent proteins showed that the onset of Ca(2+) overload signalled a progressive increase in the diffusion of small reporter molecules across the nuclear envelope. Later, calpain-mediated changes in nuclear pore permeability allowed accumulation of large proteins in the nucleus. Further, in a model of excitotoxic neuronal degeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found similar nuclear changes and redistribution of fluorescent probes across the nuclear membrane in dying neurons. Our findings strongly suggest that increased leakiness of the nuclear barrier affects nucleocytoplasmic transport, alters the localization of proteins across the nuclear envelope and it is likely to be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent cell death, including ischemic neuronal demise.",M2
19706512,"Structural and functional analysis of Nup120 suggests ring formation of the Nup84 complex.The Nup84 complex constitutes a key building block in the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). Here we present the crystal structure of one of its 7 components, Nup120, which reveals a beta propeller and an alpha-helical domain representing a novel fold. We discovered a previously unidentified interaction of Nup120 with Nup133 and confirmed the physiological relevance in vivo. As mapping of the individual components in the Nup84 complex places Nup120 and Nup133 at opposite ends of the heptamer, our findings indicate a head-to-tail arrangement of elongated Nup84 complexes into a ring structure, consistent with a fence-like coat for the nuclear pore membrane. The attachment site for Nup133 lies at the very end of an extended unstructured region, which allows for flexibility in the diameter of the Nup84 complex ring. These results illuminate important roles of terminal unstructured segments in nucleoporins for the architecture, function, and assembly of the NPC.",M2

We show here that NDC1 directly interacts with the nucleoporin ALADIN, mutations of which are responsible for triple-A syndrome, and that this interaction is required for targeting of ALADIN to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Furthermore, we show that NDC1 is required for selective nuclear import. Our findings suggest that NDC1-mediated localization of ALADIN to NPCs is essential for selective nuclear protein import, and that abrogation of the interaction between ALADIN and NDC1 may be important for the development of triple-A syndrome.",M2
19696024,"Transmembrane protein-free membranes fuse into xenopus nuclear envelope and promote assembly of functional pores.Post-mitotic reassembly of nuclear envelope (NE) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been reconstituted in a cell-free system based on interphase Xenopus egg extract. To evaluate the relative contributions of cytosolic and transmembrane proteins in NE and ER assembly, we replaced a part of native membrane vesicles with ones either functionally impaired by trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide treatments or with protein-free liposomes. Although neither impaired membrane vesicles nor liposomes formed ER and nuclear membrane, they both supported assembly reactions by fusing with native membrane vesicles. At membrane concentrations insufficient to generate full-sized functional nuclei, addition of liposomes and their fusion with membrane vesicles resulted in an extensive expansion of NE, further chromatin decondensation, restoration of the functionality, and spatial distribution of the nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>), and, absent newly delivered transmembrane proteins, an increase in NPC numbers. This rescue of the nuclear assembly by liposomes was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin and thus required active nuclear transport, similarly to the assembly of full-sized functional NE with membrane vesicles. Mechanism of fusion between liposomes and between liposomes and membrane vesicles was investigated using lipid mixing assay. This fusion required interphase cytosol and, like fusion between native membrane vesicles, was inhibited by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein, and N-ethylmaleimide. Our findings suggest that interphase cytosol contains proteins that mediate the fusion stage of ER and NE reassembly, emphasize an unexpected tolerance of nucleus assembly to changes in concentrations of transmembrane proteins, and reveal the existence of a feedback mechanism that couples NE expansion with NPC assembly.",M2
19680228,"Characterisation of the passive permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) restrict uncontrolled nucleocytoplasmic fluxes of inert macromolecules but permit facilitated translocation of nuclear transport receptors and their cargo complexes. We probed the passive barrier of NPCs and observed sieve-like properties with a dominating mesh or channel radius of 2.6 nm, which is narrower than proposed earlier. A small fraction of diffusion channels has a wider opening, explaining the very slow passage of larger molecules. The observed dominant passive diameter approximates the distance of adjacent hydrophobic clusters of FG repeats, supporting the model that the barrier is made of FG repeat domains cross-linked with a spacing of an FG repeat unit length. Wheat germ agglutinin and the dominant-negative importin beta(45-462) fragment were previously regarded as selective inhibitors of facilitated NPC passage. We now observed that they do not distinguish between the passive and the facilitated mode. Instead, their inhibitory effect correlates with the size of the NPC-passing molecule. They have little effect on small species, inhibit the passage of green fluorescent protein-sized objects &gt;10-fold and virtually block the translocation of larger ones. This suggests that passive and facilitated NPC passage proceed through one and the same permeability barrier.",M2
19680225,"Cargo surface hydrophobicity is sufficient to overcome the nuclear pore complex selectivity barrier.To fulfil their function, nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) must discriminate between inert proteins and nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), admitting only the latter. This specific permeation is thought to depend on interactions between hydrophobic patches on NTRs and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) or related repeats that line the NPC. Here, we tested this premise directly by conjugating different hydrophobic amino-acid analogues to the surface of an inert protein and examining its ability to cross NPCs unassisted by NTRs. Conjugation of as few as four hydrophobic moieties was sufficient to enable passage of the protein through NPCs. Transport of the modified protein proceeded with rates comparable to those measured for the innate protein when bound to an NTR and was relatively insensitive both to the nature and density of the amino acids used to confer hydrophobicity. The latter observation suggests a non-specific, small, and plant interaction network between cargo and FG repeats.",M2

19674973,"Architectural nucleoporins Nup157/170 and Nup133 are structurally related and descend from a second ancestral element.The nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) constitutes one of the largest protein assemblies in the eukaryotic cell and forms the exclusive gateway to the nucleus. The stable, approximately 15-20-MDa scaffold ring of the NPC is built from two multiprotein complexes arranged around a central 8-fold axis. Here we present crystal structures of two large architectural units, yNup170(979-1502) and hNup107(658-925) x hNup133(517-1156), each a constituent of one of the two multiprotein complexes. Conservation of domain arrangement and of tertiary structure suggests that Nup157/170 and Nup133 derived from a common ancestor. Together with the previously established ancestral coatomer element (ACE1), these two elements constitute the major alpha-helical building blocks of the NPC scaffold and define its branched, lattice-like architecture, similar to vesicle coats like COPII. We hypothesize that the extant NPC evolved early during eukaryotic evolution from a rudimentary structure composed of several identical copies of a few ancestral elements, later diversified and specified by gene duplication.",M2
19625448,"Importin beta regulates the seeding of chromatin with initiation sites for nuclear pore assembly.The nuclear envelope of higher eukaryotic cells reforms at the exit from mitosis, in concert with the assembly of nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>). The first step in postmitotic NPC assembly involves the  seeding  of chromatin with ELYS and the Nup107-160 complex. Subsequent steps in the assembly process are poorly understood and different mechanistic models have been proposed to explain the formation of the full supramolecular structure. Here, we show that the initial step of chromatin seeding is negatively regulated by importin beta. Direct imaging of the chromatin attachment sites reveals single sites situated predominantly on the highest substructures of chromatin surface and lacking any sign of annular structures or oligomerized pre-NPCs. Surprisingly, the inhibition by importin beta is only partially reversed by RanGTP. Importin beta forms a high-molecular-weight complex with both ELYS and the Nup107-160 complex in cytosol. We suggest that initiation sites for NPC assembly contain single copies of chromatin-bound ELYS/Nup107-160 and that the lateral oligomerization of these subunits depends on the recruitment of membrane components. We predict that additional regulators, besides importin beta and Ran, may be involved in coordinating the initial seeding of chromatin with subsequent steps in the NPC assembly pathway.",M2
19596381,"Functionalization of a nanopore: the nuclear pore complex paradigm.Biological cells maintain a myriad of nanopores which, although relying on the same basic small-hole principle, serve a large variety of functions. Here we consider how the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>), a large nanopore mediating the traffic between genetic material and protein synthesizing apparatus, is functionalized to carry out a set of transport functions. A major parameter of NPC functionalization is a lining of it external and internal surfaces with so-called phenylalanine glycine (FG) proteins. FG proteins integrate a multitude of transport factor binding sites into intrinsically disordered domains. This surprising finding has given rise to a number of transport models assigning direct gating functions to FG proteins. However, recent data suggest that the properties of FG proteins cannot be properly assessed by considering only the purified, transport-factor-stripped NPC. At physiological conditions transport factors may shape FG proteins in a way allotting an essential role to surface diffusion, reconciling tight binding with efficient transport. Thus, NPC studies are revealing both general traits and novel aspects of nanopore functionalization. In addition, they inspire artificial molecule sorters for proteomic and pharmaceutical applications.",M2
19591452,"Near-field optical study of protein transport kinetics at a single nuclear pore.The kinetics of proteins passing through individual nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) of the nuclear envelope (NE) was studied using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) in combination with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The NSOM probe was placed over a single pore in an unsupported native NE to observe fluorescence-labeled NTF2 moving in the transport channel. A correlation analysis of the arising fluorescence fluctuations enabled us to characterize the translocation as driven by Brownian motion and to determine the related kinetic constants. Though trapped in the pore, NTF2 turned out to be highly mobile within a large axial extension. Our findings support the idea that molecules in transit interact with NPC proteins containing phenylalanine-glycine-repeat domains at the periphery of the channel. NSOM-FCS may help to understand the facilitated translocation in more detail and offers a new way to study single molecule mobility on a nanoscale.",M2

The stable core is essentially built from two multiprotein complexes, the Y-shaped heptameric Nup84 complex and the Nic96 complex, arranged around an eightfold axis. We present the crystal structure of Nup120(1-757), one of the two short arms of the Y-shaped Nup84 complex. The protein adopts a compact oval shape built around a novel bipartite alpha-helical domain intimately integrated with a beta-propeller domain. The domain arrangement is substantially different from the Nup85*Seh1 complex, which forms the other short arm of the Y.

19548985,"Binding site distribution of nuclear transport receptors and transport complexes in single nuclear pore complexes.Transport through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) involves a large channel and an abundance of binding sites for nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). However, the mechanistically important distribution of NTR-binding sites along the channel is vividly debated. In this study, we visualized binding site distributions directly by two complementary optical super-resolution methods, single-molecule microscopy and 4Pi microscopy. First, we analyzed the distribution of RanGDP because this important nuclear transport substrate has two types of binding sites at the NPC, direct and indirect, NTR-mediated sites. We found that the direct binding sites had a maximum at approximately -30 nm with regard to the NPC center, whereas the indirect transport-relevant binding sites peaked at approximately -10 nm. The 20 nm-shift could be only resolved by 4Pi microscopy because of a two to threefold improved localization precision as compared with single-molecule microscopy. Then we analyzed the distribution of the NTR Kapbeta1 and a Kapbeta1-based transport complex and found them to have also binding maxima at approximately -10 nm. These observations support transport models in which NTR binding sites are distributed all along the transport channel and argue against models in which the cytoplasmic entrance of the channel is surrounded by a large cloud of binding sites.",M2
19543230,"The role of nuclear pores in gene regulation, development and disease.Nuclear-pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are large protein channels that span the nuclear envelope (NE), which is a double membrane that encloses the nuclear genome of eukaryotes. Each of the typically 2,000-4,000 pores in the NE of vertebrate cells is composed of multiple copies of 30 different proteins known as nucleoporins. The evolutionarily conserved NPC proteins have the well-characterized function of mediating the transport of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. Mutations in nucleoporins are often linked to specific developmental defects and disease, and the resulting phenotypes are usually interpreted as the consequences of perturbed nuclear transport activity. However, recent evidence suggests that NPCs have additional functions in chromatin organization and gene regulation, some of which might be independent of nuclear transport. Here, we review the transport-dependent and transport-independent roles of NPCs in the regulation of nuclear function and gene expression.",M2
19525551,"Evidence for a shared nuclear pore complex architecture that is conserved from the last common eukaryotic ancestor.The nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) is a macromolecular assembly embedded within the nuclear envelope that mediates bidirectional exchange of material between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our recent work on the yeast NPC has revealed a simple modularity in its architecture and suggested a common evolutionary origin of the NPC and vesicle coating complexes in a progenitor protocoatomer. However, detailed compositional and structural information is currently only available for vertebrate and yeast NPCs, which are evolutionarily closely related. Hence our understanding of NPC composition in a full evolutionary context is sparse. Moreover despite the ubiquitous nature of the NPC, sequence searches in distant taxa have identified surprisingly few NPC components, suggesting that much of the NPC may not be conserved. Thus, to gain a broad perspective on the origins and evolution of the NPC, we performed proteomics analyses of NPC-containing fractions from a divergent eukaryote (Trypanosoma brucei) and obtained a comprehensive inventory of its nucleoporins. Strikingly trypanosome nucleoporins clearly share with metazoa and yeast their fold type, domain organization, composition, and modularity. Overall these data provide conclusive evidence that the majority of NPC architecture is indeed conserved throughout the Eukaryota and was already established in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that NPCs share a common ancestry with vesicle coating complexes and that both were established very early in eukaryotic evolution.",M2

19507204,"Stable, non-destructive immobilization of native nuclear membranes to micro-structured PDMS for single-molecule force spectroscopy.In eukaryotic cells the nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double-membraned nuclear envelope (NE). Exchange of molecules between the two compartments is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) that are embedded in the NE membranes. The translocation of molecules such as proteins and RNAs through the nuclear membrane is executed by transport shuttling factors (karyopherines). They thereby dock to particular binding sites located all over the NPC, the so-called phenylalanine-glycin nucleoporines (FG Nups). Molecular recognition force spectroscopy (MRFS) allows investigations of the binding at the single-molecule level. Therefore the AFM tip carries a ligand for example, a particular karyopherin whereas the nuclear membrane with its receptors is mounted on a surface. Hence, one of the first requirements to study the nucleocytoplasmatic transport mechanism using MRFS is the development of an optimized membrane preparation that preserves structure and function of the NPCs. In this study we present a stable non-destructive preparation method of Xenopus laevis nuclear envelopes. We use micro-structured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that provides an ideal platform for immobilization and biological integrity due to its elastic, chemical and mechanical properties. It is a solid basis for studying molecular recognition, transport interactions, and translocation processes through the NPC. As a first recognition system we investigate the interaction between an important transport shuttling factor, importin beta, and its binding sites on the NPC, the FG-domains.",M2

Mutations in A-type lamins cause a wide range of human genetic disorders (laminopathies). The importance of lamin A (LaA) in the spatial arrangement of nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) prompted us to study the role of LaA mutants in nuclear protein transport. Two mutants, causing prenatal skin disease restrictive dermopathy (RD) and the premature aging disease Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome, were used for expression in HeLa cells to investigate their impact on the subcellular localization of NPC-associated proteins and nuclear protein import. Furthermore, dynamics of the LaA mutants within the nuclear lamina were studied. We observed affected localization of NPC-associated proteins, diminished lamina dynamics for both LaA mutants and reduced nuclear import of representative cargo molecules. Intriguingly, both LaA mutants displayed similar effects on nuclear morphology and functions, despite their differences in disease severity. Reduced nuclear protein import was also seen in RD fibroblasts and impaired lamina dynamics for the nucleoporin Nup153. Our data thus represent the first study of a direct link between LaA mutant expression and reduced nuclear protein import.",M2
19414609,"Role of the Ndc1 interaction network in yeast nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance.The nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) mediates all nucleocytoplasmic transport, yet its structure and biogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we have functionally characterized interaction partners of the yeast transmembrane nucleoporin Ndc1. Ndc1 forms a distinct complex with the transmembrane proteins Pom152 and Pom34 and two alternative complexes with the soluble nucleoporins Nup53 and Nup59, which in turn bind to Nup170 and Nup157. The transmembrane and soluble Ndc1-binding partners have redundant functions at the NPC, and disruption of both groups of interactions causes defects in Ndc1 targeting and in NPC structure accompanied by significant pore dilation. Using photoconvertible fluorescent protein fusions, we further show that the depletion of Pom34 in cells that lack NUP53 and NUP59 blocks new NPC assembly and leads to the reversible accumulation of newly made nucleoporins in cytoplasmic foci. Therefore, Ndc1 together with its interaction partners are collectively essential for the biosynthesis and structural integrity of yeast NPCs.",M2
19414608,"The nucleoporins Nup170p and Nup157p are essential for nuclear pore complex assembly.We have established that two homologous nucleoporins, Nup170p and Nup157p, play an essential role in the formation of nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By regulating their synthesis, we showed that the loss of these nucleoporins triggers a decrease in NPCs caused by a halt in new NPC assembly. Preexisting NPCs are ultimately lost by dilution as cells grow, causing the inhibition of nuclear transport and the loss of viability. Significantly, the loss of Nup170p/Nup157p had distinct effects on the assembly of different architectural components of the NPC. Nucleoporins (nups) positioned on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC rapidly accumulated in cytoplasmic foci. These nup complexes could be recruited into new NPCs after reinitiation of Nup170p synthesis, and may represent a physiological intermediate. Loss of Nup170p/Nup157p also caused core and nucleoplasmically positioned nups to accumulate in NPC-like structures adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane, which suggests that these nucleoporins are required for formation of the pore membrane and the incorporation of cytoplasmic nups into forming NPCs.",M2

19393704,"Tissue-specific and transcription factor-mediated nuclear entry of DNA.Low levels of gene transfer and a lack of tissue-specific targeting of vectors have limited the therapeutic potential of non-viral gene therapy. This is due to the numerous cellular barriers that hinder nuclear delivery of vectors and the paucity of methods that restrict expression to specific cells types. In non-dividing cells, the nuclear envelope is an especially problematic hurdle to gene transfer. Given that the majority of target tissues are non-dividing in vivo, the nuclear membrane is a major obstacle to therapeutic gene transfer. In this review, the various barriers to gene transfer are discussed. In particular, the role of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) in regulating passage of plasmid vectors during interphase is reviewed. Several methods of modifying plasmid (pDNA) vectors to enhance nuclear import through the NPC are also discussed, including the use of tissue-specific transcription factors to mediate nuclear entry of pDNA in a cell-specific manner.",M2

We detected structural differences between the NPCs of dividing and quiescent nuclei. Importantly, we also traced the organizational pattern of the NPCs, and observed non-random NPC distribution over the nuclear surface.

We present here the crystal structure of Sus1 and Cdc31 bound to a central region of Sac3 (the CID domain) that is crucial for its function. Sac3(CID) forms a long, gently undulating alpha helix around which one Cdc31 and two Sus1 chains are wrapped. Sus1 has an articulated helical hairpin fold that facilitates its wrapping around Sac3. In vivo studies using engineered mutations that selectively disrupted binding of individual chains to Sac3 indicated that Sus1 and Cdc31 function synergistically to promote NPC association of TREX-2 and mRNA nuclear export. These data indicate Sac3(CID) provides a scaffold within TREX-2 to integrate interactions between protein complexes to facilitate the coupling of transcription and mRNA export during gene expression.",M2

19289793,"Sem1 is a functional component of the nuclear pore complex-associated messenger RNA export machinery.The evolutionarily conserved protein Sem1/Dss1 is a subunit of the regulatory particle (RP) of the proteasome, and, in mammalian cells, binds the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2. Here, we describe a new function for yeast Sem1. We show that sem1 mutants are impaired in messenger RNA (mRNA) export and transcription elongation, and induce strong transcription-associated hyper-recombination phenotypes. Importantly, Sem1, independent of the RP, is functionally linked to the mRNA export pathway. Biochemical analyses revealed that, in addition to the RP, Sem1 coenriches with components of two other multisubunit complexes: the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>)-associated TREX-2 complex that is required for transcription-coupled mRNA export, and the COP9 signalosome, which is involved in deneddylation. Notably, targeting of Thp1, a TREX-2 component, to the NPC is perturbed in a sem1 mutant. These findings reveal an unexpected nonproteasomal function of Sem1 in mRNA export and in prevention of transcription-associated genome instability. Thus, Sem1 is a versatile protein that might stabilize multiple protein complexes involved in diverse pathways.",M2

Whereas small molecules can diffuse freely through NPCs, large molecules (&gt;40 kD) can pass only when bound to transport receptors. The NPC central channel is filled with disordered proteins, rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats, referred to as FG-nups. Our simulations, carried out at coarse-grained and all-atom levels, show that arrays of FG-nups tethered to a planar surface, at an FG-repeat density found in the NPC, form dynamic brush-like structures of multiprotein bundles, whereas individual FG-nups form dynamic globular structures. More than half of the FG-repeats are found on the surface of the bundles, offering a favorable environment for transport receptors. Binding to FG-repeats and a sliding motion of NTF2 induced by binding and unbinding to phenylalanines were observed when adding this transport receptor into one of the brush-like structures.",M2

However, the conformation of the FG domains in vivo, their arrangement in relation to the transport channel and their function(s) in transport are still vividly debated. Here, we revisit a number of representative transport models-specifically Brownian affinity gating, selective phase gating, reversible FG domain collapse, and reduction of dimensionality (ROD)-in the light of new data obtained by optical single transporter recording, optical superresolution microscopy, artificial nanopores, and many other techniques. The analysis suggests that a properly adapted, simplified version of the ROD model accounts well for the available data. This has implications for nucleocytoplasmic transport in general.",M2

The mechanism for de novo pore and NPC biogenesis remains unclear. Reticulons (RTNs) and Yop1/DP1 are conserved membrane protein families required to form and maintain the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the postmitotic nuclear envelope. In this study, we report that members of the RTN and Yop1/DP1 families are required for nuclear pore formation. Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae prp20-G282S and nup133 Delta NPC assembly mutants revealed perturbations in Rtn1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Yop1-GFP ER distribution and colocalization to NPC clusters. Combined deletion of RTN1 and YOP1 resulted in NPC clustering, nuclear import defects, and synthetic lethality with the additional absence of Pom34, Pom152, and Nup84 subcomplex members. We tested for a direct role in NPC biogenesis using Xenopus laevis in vitro assays and found that anti-Rtn4a antibodies specifically inhibited de novo nuclear pore formation.

19240118,"Assembly of nuclear pore complexes mediated by major vault protein.During interphase growth of eukaryotic cells, nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are continuously incorporated into the intact nuclear envelope (NE) by mechanisms that are largely unknown. De novo formation of NPCs involves local fusion events between the inner and outer nuclear membrane, formation of a transcisternal membranous channel of defined diameter and the coordinated assembly of hundreds of nucleoporins into the characteristic NPC structure. Here we have used a cell-free system based on Xenopus egg extract, which allows the experimental separation of nuclear-membrane assembly and NPC formation. Nuclei surrounded by a closed double nuclear membrane, but devoid of NPCs, were first reconstituted from chromatin and a specific membrane fraction. Insertion of NPCs into the preformed pore-free nuclei required cytosol containing soluble nucleoporins or nucleoporin subcomplexes and, quite unexpectedly, major vault protein (MVP). MVP is the main component of vaults, which are ubiquitous barrel-shaped particles of enigmatic function. Our results implicate MVP, and thus also vaults, in NPC biogenesis and provide a functional explanation for the association of a fraction of vaults with the NE and specifically with NPCs in intact cells.",M2
19225157,"Mlp1 acts as a mitotic scaffold to spatially regulate spindle assembly checkpoint proteins in Aspergillus nidulans.During open mitosis several nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) proteins have mitotic specific localizations and functions. We find that the Aspergillus nidulans Mlp1 NPC protein has previously unrealized mitotic roles involving spatial regulation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins. In interphase, An-Mlp1 tethers the An-Mad1 and An-Mad2 SAC proteins to NPCs. During a normal mitosis, An-Mlp1, An-Mad1, and An-Mad2 localize similarly on, and around, kinetochores until telophase when they transiently localize near the spindle but not at kinetochores. During SAC activation, An-Mlp1 remains associated with kinetochores in a manner similar to An-Mad1 and An-Mad2. Although An-Mlp1 is not required for An-Mad1 kinetochore localization during early mitosis, it is essential to maintain An-Mad1 in the extended region around kinetochores in early mitosis and near the spindle in telophase. Our data are consistent with An-Mlp1 being part of a mitotic spindle matrix similar to its Drosophila orthologue and demonstrate that this matrix localizes SAC proteins. By maintaining SAC proteins near the mitotic apparatus, An-Mlp1 may help monitor mitotic progression and coordinate efficient mitotic exit. Consistent with this possibility, An-Mad1 and An-Mlp1 redistribute from the telophase matrix and associate with segregated kinetochores when mitotic exit is prevented by expression of nondegradable cyclin B.",M2

Lamin C initially appeared where NPCs were clustered, and subsequently extended along the nuclear periphery accompanied by the recovery of the regular distribution of NPCs. In contrast, lamin Dm(0) did not show association with the clustered NPCs during lamina formation and NPC spacing recovered only after completion of a closed lamin Dm(0) layer. Further, when lamin Dm(0) and C were both expressed, they did not co-polymerize, initiating layer formation in separate regions. Thus, A and B-type lamins reveal differing properties during lamina assembly, with A-type having the primary role in organizing NPC distribution. This previously unknown complexity in the assembly of the nuclear lamina could be the basis for intricate nuclear envelope functions.",M2

However, the fate of nuclear pores in postmitotic cells is unknown. Here, we show that NPCs, unlike other nuclear structures, do not turn over in differentiated cells. While a subset of NPC components, like Nup153 and Nup50, are continuously exchanged, scaffold nucleoporins, like the Nup107/160 complex, are extremely long-lived and remain incorporated in the nuclear membrane during the entire cellular life span. Besides the lack of nucleoporin expression and NPC turnover, we discovered an age-related deterioration of NPCs, leading to an increase in nuclear permeability and the leaking of cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus. Our finding that nuclear  leakiness  is dramatically accelerated during aging and that a subset of nucleoporins is oxidatively damaged in old cells suggests that the accumulation of damage at the NPC might be a crucial aging event.",M2

19146848,"Early embryonic requirement for nucleoporin Nup35/NPP-19 in nuclear assembly.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are gateways for transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and play crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. NPCs are composed of multiple copies of approximately 30 different nucleoporins (nups) that display both ubiquitous and cell type specific functions during development. Vertebrate Nup35 (also known as Nup53) was previously described to interact with Nup93, Nup155 and Nup205 and to be required for nuclear envelope (NE) assembly in vitro. Here, we report the first in vivo characterization of a Nup35 mutation, npp-19(tm2886), and its temperature-dependent effects on Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis. At restrictive temperature, npp-19(tm2886) embryos exhibit chromosome missegregation, nuclear morphology defects and die around mid-gastrulation. Depletion of Nup35/NPP-19 inhibits NE localization of Nup155/NPP-8, NPC assembly and nuclear lamina formation. Consequently, nuclear envelope function, including nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, is impaired. In contrast, recruitment of Nup107/NPP-5, LEM-2 and nuclear membranes to the chromatin surface is Nup35/NPP-19-independent, suggesting an uncoupling of nuclear membrane targeting and NPC assembly in the absence of Nup35/NPP-19. We propose that Nup35/NPP-19 has an evolutionary conserved role in NE formation and function, and that this role is particularly critical during the rapid cell divisions of early embryogenesis.",M2

Several surveillance systems that monitor nuclear mRNP biogenesis and export have been described, but the mechanism by which the improper mRNPs are recognized and eliminated remains poorly understood. Here we report that the conserved PIN domain protein Swt1 is an RNA endonuclease that participates in quality control of nuclear mRNPs and can associate with the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). Swt1 showed endoribonuclease activity in vitro that was inhibited by a point mutation in the predicted catalytic site. Swt1 lacked clear sequence specificity but showed a strong preference for single-stranded regions. Genetic interactions were found between Swt1 and the THO/TREX and TREX-2 complexes, and with components of the perinuclear mRNP surveillance system, Mlp1, Nup60, and Esc1. Inhibition of the nuclease activity of Swt1 increased the levels and cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced aberrant pre-mRNA, and induced robust nuclear poly(A)(+) RNA accumulation in mlp1Delta and esc1Delta strains. Overexpression of Swt1 also caused strong nuclear poly(A)(+) RNA accumulation. Swt1 is normally distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm but becomes concentrated at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the nup133Delta mutant, which causes NPC clustering and defects in mRNP export. The data suggest that Swt1 endoribonuclease might be transiently recruited to NPCs to initiate the degradation of defective pre-mRNPs or mRNPs trapped at nuclear periphery in order to avoid their cytoplasmic export and translation.",M2

The Seh1*Nup85 assembly bears resemblance in its shape and dimensions to that of another nucleoporin pair, Sec13*Nup145C. Furthermore, the Seh1*Nup85 structures reveal a hinge motion that may facilitate conformational changes in the NPC during import of integral membrane proteins and/or during nucleocytoplasmic transport. We propose that Seh1*Nup85 and Sec13*Nup145C form 16 alternating, vertical rods that are horizontally linked by the three remaining nucleoporins of the coat cylinder. Shared architectural and mechanistic principles with the COPII coat indicate a common evolutionary origin and support the notion that the NPC coat represents another class of membrane coats.",M2
19106628,"Nuclear phosphoinositide signaling regulates messenger RNA export.Messenger RNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm plays an essential role in linking transcription to translation and consequently regulation of protein expression. mRNA export requires a series of events: pre-mRNA processing, ribonucleoprotein targeting to the <e>NPC</e> (nuclear pore complexes), and translocation through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the conventional nuclear export machinery, exportins and the Ran GTPase, is not required for mRNA export. Instead, a protein complex consisting of a number of RNA binding proteins is essential for this event including the Aly/REF protein. Phosphoinositide signaling regulates a variety of cellular functions including pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export. In fact, a phospholipase C-dependent inositol polyphosphate kinase pathway is required for efficient mRNA export. Recently, we showed that Aly is a physiological target of nuclear phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which regulates Aly localization as well as Aly function in cell proliferation and mRNA export through nuclear Akt-mediated phosphorylation and phosphoinositide association. Hence, water-soluble inositol polyphosphates and phosphatidylinositol lipids play pivotal roles in modulating mRNA export.",M2
19098896,"Artificial nanopores that mimic the transport selectivity of the nuclear pore complex.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) act as effective and robust gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, selecting for the passage of particular macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a approximately 30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed 'phenylalanine-glycine' (FG)-nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen. Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size-dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo-bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins. To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport-factor-binding FG-nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport-factor-cargo complexes that specifically bind FG-nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG-nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG-nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import.",M2

To investigate how the NPC core is maintained, we affinity purified the major core An-Nup84-120 complex and identified two new fungal Nups, An-Nup37 and An-ELYS, previously thought to be vertebrate specific. During mitosis the An-Nup84-120 complex locates to the NE and spindle pole bodies but, unlike vertebrate cells, does not concentrate at kinetochores. We find that mutants lacking individual An-Nup84-120 components are sensitive to the membrane destabilizer benzyl alcohol (BA) and high temperature. Although such mutants display no defects in mitotic spindle formation, they undergo mitotic specific disassembly of the NPC core and transient aggregation of the mitotic NE, suggesting the An-Nup84-120 complex might function with membrane. Supporting this, we show cells devoid of all known fungal transmembrane Nups (An-Ndc1, An-Pom152, and An-Pom34) are viable but that An-ndc1 deletion combined with deletion of individual An-Nup84-120 components is either lethal or causes sensitivity to treatments expected to destabilize membrane. Therefore, the An-Nup84-120 complex performs roles, perhaps at the NPC membrane as proposed previously, that become essential without the An-Ndc1 transmembrane Nup.",M2

Tpr directly binds to Mad1 and Mad2. Depletion of Tpr in HeLa cells disrupts the NPC localization of Mad1 and Mad2 during interphase and decreases the levels of Mad1-bound Mad2. Furthermore, depletion of Tpr decreases the levels of Mad1 at kinetochores during prometaphase, correlating with the inability of Mad1 to activate Mad2, which is required for inhibiting APC(Cdc20). These findings reveal an important role for Tpr in which Mad1-Mad2 proteins are regulated during the cell cycle and mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling.",M2

Structural, biochemical, and genetic analyses position the Nup84 complex in two peripheral NPC rings. We establish a conserved tripartite element, the ancestral coatomer element ACE1, that reoccurs in several nucleoporins and vesicle coat proteins, providing structural evidence of coevolution from a common ancestor. We identified interactions that define the organization of the Nup84 complex on the basis of comparison with vesicle coats and confirmed the sites by mutagenesis.

After bleaching the dominant GFP fluorescence the interactions of the microinjected molecules could be studied using video microscopy with a time resolution of 5 ms, achieving a colocalization precision of 30 nm. These measurements allowed defining the interaction sites with the NPCs with an unprecedented precision, and the comparison of the interaction kinetics with previous in vitro measurements revealed new insights into the translocation mechanism.",M2
18689878,"Synthetic genetic array analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides evidence for an interaction between RAT8/DBP5 and genes encoding P-body components.Coordination of the multiple steps of mRNA biogenesis helps to ensure proper regulation of gene expression. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DEAD-box protein Rat8p/Dbp5p is an essential mRNA export factor that functions at the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) where it is thought to remodel mRNA/protein complexes during mRNA export. Rat8p also functions in translation termination and has been implicated in functioning during early transcription. We conducted a synthetic genetic array analysis (SGA) using a strain harboring the temperature-sensitive rat8-2 allele. Although RAT8 had been shown to interact genetically with &gt;15 other genes, we identified &gt;40 additional genes whose disruption in a rat8-2 background causes synthetic lethality or dramatically reduced growth. Included were five that encode components of P-bodies, sites of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover and storage. Wild-type Rat8p localizes to NPCs and diffusely throughout the cell but rat8-2p localized to cytoplasmic granules at nonpermissive temperature that are distinct from P-bodies. In some genetic backgrounds, these granules also contain poly(A)-binding protein, Pab1p, and additional mRNA export factors. Although these foci are distinct from P-bodies, the two merge under heat-stress conditions. We suggest that these granules reflect defective mRNP remodeling during mRNA export and during cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism.",M2
18688269,"Intramolecular cohesion of coils mediated by phenylalanine--glycine motifs in the natively unfolded domain of a nucleoporin.The nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) provides the sole aqueous conduit for macromolecular exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells. Its diffusion conduit contains a size-selective gate formed by a family of NPC proteins that feature large, natively unfolded domains with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). These domains of nucleoporins play key roles in establishing the NPC permeability barrier, but little is known about their dynamic structure. Here we used molecular modeling and biophysical techniques to characterize the dynamic ensemble of structures of a representative FG domain from the yeast nucleoporin Nup116. The results showed that its FG motifs function as intramolecular cohesion elements that impart order to the FG domain and compact its ensemble of structures into native premolten globular configurations. At the NPC, the FG motifs of nucleoporins may exert this cohesive effect intermolecularly as well as intramolecularly to form a malleable yet cohesive quaternary structure composed of highly flexible polypeptide chains. Dynamic shifts in the equilibrium or competition between intra- and intermolecular FG motif interactions could facilitate the rapid and reversible structural transitions at the NPC conduit needed to accommodate passing karyopherin-cargo complexes of various shapes and sizes while simultaneously maintaining a size-selective gate against protein diffusion.",M2
18678902,"Apoptosis leads to a degradation of vital components of active nuclear transport and a dissociation of the nuclear lamina.Apoptosis, a physiologically critical process, is characterized by a destruction of the cell after sequential degradation of key cellular components. Here, we set out to explore the fate of the physiologically indispensable nuclear envelope (NE) in this process. The NE mediates the critical nucleocytoplasmic transport through nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>). In addition, the NE is involved in gene expression and contributes significantly to the overall structure and mechanical stability of the cell nucleus through the nuclear lamina, which underlies the entire nucleoplasmic face of the NE and thereby interconnects the NPCs, the NE, and the genomic material. Using the nano-imaging and mechanical probing approach atomic force microscopy (AFM) and biochemical methods, we unveiled the fate of the NE during apoptosis. The doomed NE sustains a degradation of both the mediators of the critical selective nucleocytoplasmic transport, namely NPC cytoplasmic filaments and basket, and the nuclear lamina. These observations are paralleled by marked softening and destabilization of the NE and the detection of vesicle-like nuclear fragments. We conclude that destruction of the cell nucleus during apoptosis proceeds in a strategic fashion. Degradation of NPC cytoplasmic filaments and basket shuts down the critical selective nucleocytoplasmic cross-talk. Degradation of the nuclear lamina disrupts the pivotal connection between the NE and the chromatin, breaks up the overall nuclear architecture, and softens the NE, thereby enabling the formation of nuclear fragments at later stages of apoptosis.",M2
18630756,"Nuclear RNA export and its importance in abiotic stress responses of plants.Transduction of developmental and environmental cues into the nucleus to induce transcription and the export of RNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) play pivotal roles in regulation of gene expression. The process of bulk export of mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Assembly of export-competent mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) is coupled with both transcription and mRNA processing. The export-competent mRNP consists of mRNAs and a dozen nucleocytoplasmic shuttling nuclear proteins, including RNA export factors (Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimer, Npl3), poly(A)-binding proteins, DEAD-box protein 5 (Dbp5), and nucleoporins (NUPs) in yeast. Mobile NUPs help docking of mRNP to the NPC nuclear basket. A partially unfolded mRNP complex appears to be pulled through the NPC by using energy from Dbp5-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Dbp5 probably catalyzes the release of mRNA from mRNP in the cytoplasm. In contrast to bulk export of mRNAs by a Mex67-Mtr2/Npl3-dependent pathway, a specific subset of mRNA export under stress and export of microRNAs are mediated through the karyopherin (importin beta) family of proteins in a Ran-GTPase-dependent pathway. Our knowledge of mRNA export mechanisms in flowering plants is in its infancy. Some proteins of the NUP107-160 complex, NUPs and DEAD-box proteins (DBPs), have been studied in flowering plants. Arabidopsis NUP160/SAR1 plays a critical role in mRNA export, regulation of flowering, and hormone and abiotic stress responses, whereas NUP96/ SAR3/MOS3 is required for mRNA export to modulate hormonal and biotic stress responses. DEAD-box proteins have been implicated in mRNA export and abiotic stress response of yeast and higher plants. Arabidopsis DBP CRYOPHYTE/LOS4 plays an important role in mRNA export, abiotic stress response, germination, and plant development. Further studies on various components of nuclear mRNA export in plants during nonstress and stress conditions will be necessary to understand the link between mRNA export and stress-responsive gene expression.",M2
18570875,"Structural and functional studies of Nup107/Nup133 interaction and its implications for the architecture of the nuclear pore complex.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) are 40-60 MDa protein assemblies embedded in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. NPCs exclusively mediate all transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. The nucleoporins that build the NPC are arranged in a stable core of module-like subcomplexes with eight-fold rotational symmetry. To gain insight into the intricate assembly of the NPC, we have solved the crystal structure of a protein complex between two nucleoporins, human Nup107 and Nup133. Both proteins form elongated structures that interact tightly via a compact interface in tail-to-tail fashion. Additional experiments using structure-guided mutants show that Nup107 is the critical anchor for Nup133 to the NPC, positioning Nup133 at the periphery of the NPC. The significant topological differences between Nup107 and Nup133 suggest that *-helical nucleoporin domains of the NPC scaffold fall in different classes and fulfill largely nonredundant functions.",M2
18562297,"Single-molecule measurements of importin alpha/cargo complex dissociation at the nuclear pore.Macromolecules are transported between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells through nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>). Large (more than approximately 40 kDa) transport cargoes imported into the nucleus typically form a complex with at least one soluble transport cofactor of the importin (Imp) beta superfamily. Many cargoes require an accessory cofactor, Imp alpha, which binds to Imp beta and to the nuclear localization sequence on the cargo. We previously reported the use of narrow-field epifluorescence microscopy to directly monitor cargoes in transit through NPCs in permeabilized cells. We now report an expanded approach in which single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is used to detect the disassembly of Imp alpha/cargo complexes as they transit through NPCs. We found that CAS, the recycling cofactor for Imp alpha, and RanGTP are essential for this dissociation process. After Imp alpha/cargo complex dissociation, most Imp alpha and cargo molecules entered the nucleoplasm. In contrast, the majority of Imp alpha/cargo complexes that did not dissociate at the NPC in the presence of CAS and RanGTP returned to the cytoplasm. These data are consistent with a model in which Imp alpha/cargo complexes are dissociated on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, and this dissociation requires both CAS and RanGTP.",M2
18544502,"Biology and biophysics of the nuclear pore complex and its components.Nucleocytoplasmic exchange of proteins and ribonucleoprotein particles occurs via nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) that reside in the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE). Significant progress has been made during the past few years in obtaining better structural resolution of the three-dimensional architecture of NPC with the help of cryo-electron tomography and atomic structures of domains from nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins). Biophysical and imaging approaches have helped elucidate how nucleoporins act as a selective barrier in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Nucleoporins act not only in trafficking of macromolecules but also in proper microtubule attachment to kinetochores, in the regulation of gene expression and signaling events associated with, for example, innate and adaptive immunity, development and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent research has also been focused on the dynamic processes of NPC assembly and disassembly that occur with each cell cycle. Here we review emerging results aimed at understanding the molecular arrangement of the NPC and how it is achieved, defining the roles of individual nucleoporins both at the NPC and at other sites within the cell, and finally deciphering how the NPC serves as both a barrier and a conduit of active transport.",M2
18539113,"Nuclear pore composition regulates neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation in the mouse embryo.Serving as the primary conduit for communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) impact nearly every cellular process. The extent to which NPC composition varies and the functional significance of such variation in mammalian development has not been investigated. Here we report that a null allele of mouse nucleoporin Nup133, a structural subunit of the NPC, disrupts neural differentiation. We find that expression of Nup133 is cell type and developmental stage restricted, with prominent expression in dividing progenitors. Nup133-deficient epiblast and ES cells abnormally maintain features of pluripotency and differentiate inefficiently along the neural lineage. Neural progenitors achieve correct spatial patterning in mutant embryos; however, they are impaired in generating terminally differentiated neurons, as are Nup133 null ES cells. Our results reveal a role for structural nucleoporins in coordinating cell differentiation events in the developing embryo.",M2

We applied three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to circumvent this limit and to study the mammalian nucleus. By simultaneously imaging chromatin, nuclear lamina, and the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>), we observed several features that escape detection by conventional microscopy. We could resolve single NPCs that colocalized with channels in the lamin network and peripheral heterochromatin. We could differentially localize distinct NPC components and detect double-layered invaginations of the nuclear envelope in prophase as previously seen only by electron microscopy.

Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes, forming aqueous channels that allow free diffusion of small molecules but that also mediate the energy-dependent transport of large macromolecules. The NPC represents the largest known molecular complex and is composed of about 30 different proteins, termed nucleoporins (Nups).

In this article, we seek to understand and evaluate the potential biomechanical reasons for this eightfold symmetry. Our analytical investigation shows that the eightfold symmetry maximizes the bending stiffness of each of the eight NPC spokes while our computational analyses identify the most likely deformation modes, frequencies, and associated kinetic energies of the NPC. These modes have energies close to other published findings using membrane analysis of the nuclear membrane pore opening, and deformation states in agreement with experimental observations. A better understanding of NPC mechanics is essential for characterizing the nucleocytoplasmic transport, which has a central importance in cell biology.",M2
18450775,"Nuclear pore disassembly from endoplasmic reticulum membranes promotes Ca2+ signalling competency.The functionality of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a Ca(2+) storage organelle is supported by families of Ca(2+) pumps, buffers and channels that regulate Ca(2+) fluxes between the ER lumen and cytosol. Although many studies have identified heterogeneities in Ca(2+) fluxes throughout the ER, the question of how differential functionality of Ca(2+) channels is regulated within proximal regions of the same organelle is unresolved. Here, we studied the in vivo dynamics of an ER subdomain known as annulate lamellae (AL), a cytoplasmic nucleoporin-containing organelle widely used in vitro to study the mechanics of nuclear envelope breakdown. We show that nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) within AL suppress local Ca(2+) signalling activity, an inhibitory influence relieved by heterogeneous dissociation of nucleoporins to yield NPC-denuded ER domains competent at Ca(2+) signalling. Consequently, we propose a novel generalized role for AL - reversible attenuation of resident protein activity - such that regulated AL (dis)assembly via a kinase/phosphatase cycle allows cells to support rapid gain/loss-of-function transitions in cellular physiology.",M2
18439914,"Regulation of Wnt signaling by the nuclear pore complex.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The function of beta-catenin as a transcriptional coactivator of T-cell factor-4 (TCF-4) is crucial for colorectal carcinogenesis. However, beta-catenin has no nuclear localization signal, and the mechanisms by which beta-catenin is imported into the nucleus and forms a complex with the TCF-4 nuclear protein are poorly understood. METHODS: Proteins of 2 colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT-116 and DLD1, were immunoprecipitated with anti-TCF-4 antibody and analyzed directly by nanoflow liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The functional significance of nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) proteins in Wnt signaling was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo sumoylation, luciferase reporter, and colony formation assays. RESULTS: TCF-4 interacted with a large variety of NPC proteins including ras-related nuclear protein (Ran), Ran binding protein-2 (RanBP2), and Ran GTPase-activating protein-1 (RanGAP1). The NPC protein RanBP2 functioned as the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase of TCF-4, and sumoylation of TCF-4 enhanced the interaction between TCF-4 and beta-catenin. The overexpression of NPC proteins increased the nuclear import of the TCF-4 and beta-catenin proteins and enhanced the transcriptional activity. NPC proteins increased the growth of colorectal cancer cells, whereas sentrin-specific protease-2 inhibited it. CONCLUSIONS: Through a comprehensive proteomics approach, we revealed that NPC functions as a novel regulator of Wnt signaling and is possibly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. A new drug targeting the interactions of TCF-4 with NPC proteins as well as their sumoylation activity might be effective for suppressing aberrant Wnt signaling and the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.",M2
18375513,"4Pi microscopy of the nuclear pore complex.To explore whether super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is able to resolve topographic features of single cellular protein complexes, a two-photon 4Pi microscope was used to study the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). The microscope had an axial resolution of 110-130 nm and a two-color localization accuracy of 5-10 nm. In immune-labeled HeLa cells, NPCs could be resolved much better by 4Pi than by confocal microscopy. When two epitopes of the NPC, one localized at the tip of the cytoplasmic filaments and the other at the ring of the nuclear basket, were immune-labeled, they could be clearly resolved in single NPCs, with the distance between them determined to be 152 +/- 30 nm. In cells expressing a green fluorescent protein construct localized at the NPC center, the distances between the ring of the nuclear filaments and the NPC center was 76 +/- 12 (Potorous tridactylus cells) or 91 +/- 21 nm (normal rat kidney cells), whereas the distance between the NPC center and the tips of the cytoplasmic filaments was 84 +/- 18 nm, all values in good agreement with previous electron or single-molecule fluorescence estimates. We conclude that super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is a powerful method for analyzing single protein complexes and the cellular nanomachinery in general.",M2

18318657,"Integrating diverse data for structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.To understand the cell, we need to determine the macromolecular assembly structures, which may consist of tens to hundreds of components. First, we review the varied experimental data that characterize the assemblies at several levels of resolution. We then describe computational methods for generating the structures using these data. To maximize completeness, resolution, accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the structure determination, a computational approach is required that uses spatial information from a variety of experimental methods. We propose such an approach, defined by its three main components: a hierarchical representation of the assembly, a scoring function consisting of spatial restraints derived from experimental data, and an optimization method that generates structures consistent with the data. This approach is illustrated by determining the configuration of the 456 proteins in the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>) from baker's yeast. With these tools, we are poised to integrate structural information gathered at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy--from atoms to cells--into a common framework.",M2

NPC formation is hypothesized to occur by the interaction of mitotically stable subcomplexes that form defined structural intermediates. To determine the sequence of events that lead to breakdown and reformation of functional NPCs during mitosis, we present here our quantitative assay based on confocal time-lapse microscopy of single dividing cells. We use this assay to systematically investigate the kinetics of dis- and reassembly for eight nucleoporin subcomplexes relative to nuclear transport in NRK cells, linking the assembly state of the NPC with its function. Our data establish that NPC assembly is an ordered stepwise process that leads to import function already in a partially assembled state. We furthermore find that nucleoporin dissociation does not occur in the reverse order from binding during assembly, which may indicate a distinct mechanism.",M2
18282135,"Nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins.In eukaryotic cells, the movement of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs through the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>)--a large protein complex spanning the nuclear envelope. The nuclear transport of proteins is usually mediated by a family of transport receptors known as karyopherins. Karyopherins bind to their cargoes via recognition of nuclear localization signal (NLS) for nuclear import or nuclear export signal (NES) for export to form a transport complex. Its transport through NPC is facilitated by transient interactions between the karyopherins and NPC components. The interactions of karyopherins with their cargoes are regulated by GTPase Ran. In the current review, we describe the NPC structure, NLS, and NES, as well as the model of classic Ran-dependent transport, with special emphasis on existing alternative mechanisms; we also propose a classification of the basic mechanisms of protein transport regulation.",M2
18270266,"NEP-A and NEP-B both contribute to nuclear pore formation in Xenopus eggs and oocytes.In vertebrates, the nuclear envelope (NE) assembles and disassembles during mitosis. As the NE is a complex structure consisting of inner and outer membranes, nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) and the nuclear lamina, NE assembly must be a controlled and systematic process. In Xenopus egg extracts, NE assembly is mediated by two distinct membrane vesicle populations, termed NEP-A and NEP-B. Here, we re-investigate how these two membrane populations contribute to NPC assembly. In growing stage III Xenopus oocytes, NPC assembly intermediates are frequently observed. High concentrations of NPC assembly intermediates always correlate with fusion of vesicles into preformed membranes. In Xenopus egg extracts, two integral membrane proteins essential for NPC assembly, POM121 and NDC1, are exclusively associated with NEP-B membranes. By contrast, a third integral membrane protein associated with the NPCs, gp210, associates only with NEP-A membranes. During NE assembly, fusion between NEP-A and NEP-B led to the formation of fusion junctions at which &gt;65% of assembling NPCs were located. To investigate how each membrane type contributes to NPC assembly, we preferentially limited NEP-A in NE assembly assays. We found that, by limiting the NEP-A contribution to the NE, partially formed NPCs were assembled in which protein components of the nucleoplasmic face were depleted or absent. Our data suggest that fusion between NEP-A and NEP-B membranes is essential for NPC assembly and that, in contrast to previous reports, both membranes contribute to NPC assembly.",M2

One evolutionarily conserved subcomplex of the NPC contains the nucleoporins Nup53 and Nup155. Using truncation analysis, we have defined regions of Nup53 that bind to neighboring nucleoporins as well as those domains that target Nup53 to the NPC in vivo. Using this information, we investigated the role of Nup53 in NE and NPC assembly using Xenopus egg extracts. We show that both events require Nup53. Importantly, the analysis of Nup53 fragments revealed that the assembly activity of Nup53 depleted extracts could be reconstituted using a region of Nup53 that binds specifically to its interacting partner Nup155. On the basis of these results, we propose that the formation of a Nup53-Nup155 complex plays a critical role in the processes of NPC and NE assembly.",M2

Nic96 binds the Nsp1 complex via its N domain and assembles into the NPC framework via its central and C domain. Here, we report the crystal structure of a large structural nucleoporin, Nic96 without its N domain (Nic96DeltaN). Nic96DeltaN is composed of three domains and is a straight molecule that--although almost entirely helical--exhibits strong deviations from the predicted alpha-solenoid fold. The missing N domain projects midway from the Nic96 molecule, indicating how the Nsp1 complex might be located with respect to the rod-like Nic96. Notably, Nic96DeltaN binds in vitro to FG repeats of the Nsp1 complex. These data suggest a model of how Nic96 could organize a transport module with coiled-coil domains and FG repeats in the central pore channel.",M2

Here we report that Dbp5 functions as an RNP remodeling protein to displace the RNA-binding protein Nab2 from RNA. Strikingly, the ADP-bound form of Dbp5 and not ATP hydrolysis is required for RNP remodeling. In vivo studies with nab2 and dbp5 mutants show that a Nab2-bound mRNP is a physiological Dbp5 target.

18060562,"Atomic force microscopy visualises a hydrophobic meshwork in the central channel of the nuclear pore.Nuclear pore complexes (<e>NPCs</e>) mediate and control the transport of virtually all material between the cytosol and the nucleus. It is, therefore, unsurprising that they have long taken centre stage in physiology. A precise understanding of the NPC structure and function that remain to be thoroughly investigated yet is, thus, of crucial importance. The NPC can mediate transport both actively and passively. It remains to be clarified, however, whether transport of small molecules and macromolecules proceeds through the same route in the NPC. Furthermore, it has been shown that surface hydrophobicity represents a major sorting criterion for the active transport through NPCs. Transport factors like importin beta, which exhibit a rather large surface hydrophobicity, bind to their cargo and are believed to interact with a supposedly hydrophobic meshwork that is assumed to reside in the central channel of the NPC but has not yet been visualised. This interaction is presumed to lead to a partial breakdown of the meshwork, thereby, permitting the transport-cargo complexes to pass through. In this study, by using the nano-imaging approach, atomic force microscopy, we visualised under near-physiological conditions, for the first time, the presence of a hydrophobic meshwork in the NPC central channel. Furthermore, our data lend strong support for the existence of two segregated transport routes in the NPC.",M2

Nup1 is one of 30 nucleoporins comprising the NPC of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is located on the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC where it plays a role in mRNA export and protein transport. In order to further characterize the function of Nup1 we used a genetic approach to identify mutations that are synthetically lethal in combination with a deletion of NUP1 (nup1Delta). We have identified one such nup1 lethal mutant (nle6) as a temperature sensitive allele of nud1. NUD1 encodes a component of the yeast spindle pole body (SPB) and acts as scaffolding for the mitotic exit network (MEN). We observe that nle6/nud1 mutant cells have a normal distribution of NPCs within the nuclear envelope and exhibit normal rates of nuclear protein import at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures. nup1Delta also exhibits synthetic lethality with bub2Delta and bfa1Delta, both of which encode proteins that colocalize with Nud1 at spindle pole bodies and function in the mitotic exit network. However, we do not observe genetic interactions among nle6/nud1, bub2Delta, or bfa1Delta and mutations in the nucleoporin encoding genes NUP60 or NUP170, nor is nup1Delta synthetically lethal with the absence of components downstream in the mitotic exit network, including Lte1, Swi5, and Dbf2.

To determine the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC, we collected a diverse set of biophysical and proteomic data, and developed a method for using these data to localize the NPC's 456 constituent proteins (see the accompanying paper). Our structure reveals that half of the NPC is made up of a core scaffold, which is structurally analogous to vesicle-coating complexes. This scaffold forms an interlaced network that coats the entire curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane within which the NPC is embedded. The selective barrier for transport is formed by large numbers of proteins with disordered regions that line the inner face of the scaffold. The NPC consists of only a few structural modules that resemble each other in terms of the configuration of their homologous constituents, the most striking of these being a 16-fold repetition of 'columns'. These findings provide clues to the evolutionary origins of the NPC.",M2

Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins.

18042042,"APC nuclear membrane association and microtubule polarity.BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Directional cell migration is a fundamental feature of embryonic development, the inflammatory response and the metastatic spread of cancer. Migrating cells have a polarized morphology with an asymmetric distribution of signalling molecules and of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton provides the major driving force for migration in all mammalian cell types, but microtubules also play an important role in many cells, most notably neuronal precursors. RESULTS: We previously showed, using primary fibroblasts and astrocytes in in vitro scratch-induced migration assays, that the accumulation of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli; the APC tumour suppressor protein) at microtubule plus-ends promotes their association with the plasma membrane at the leading edge. This is required for polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton during directional migration. Here, we have examined the organization of microtubules in the soma of migrating neurons and fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We find that APC, through a direct interaction with the <e>NPC</e> (nuclear pore complex) protein Nup153 (nucleoporin 153), promotes the association of microtubules with the nuclear membrane.",M2

We have investigated the importance of the nuclear positioning of a gene, its transcription and the consequent export of the nascent mRNA. We show that E(y)2 is a subunit of the SAGA/TFTC-type histone acetyl transferase complex in Drosophila and that E(y)2 concentrates at the nuclear periphery. We demonstrate an interaction between E(y)2 and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and show that SAGA/TFTC also contacts the NPC at the nuclear periphery. E(y)2 forms also a complex with X-linked male sterile 2 (Xmas-2) to regulate mRNA transport both in normal conditions and after heat shock. Importantly, E(y)2 and Xmas-2 knockdown decreases the contact between the heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene loci and the nuclear envelope before and after activation and interferes with transcription. Thus, E(y)2 and Xmas-2 together with SAGA/TFTC function in the anchoring of a subset of transcription sites to the NPCs to achieve efficient transcription and mRNA export.",M2
18028944,"Structural basis for RanGTP independent entry of spliceosomal U snRNPs into the nucleus.The nuclear import of assembled spliceosomal subunits, the uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U snRNPs), is mediated by a nuclear import receptor adaptor couple of importin beta (Imp beta) and snurportin1 (SPN1). In contrast to any other characterized active nuclear import, the Imp beta/SPN1/U snRNP complex does not require RanGTP for the terminal release from the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex (<e>NPC</e>). The crystal structure of Imp beta (127-876) in complex with the Imp beta-binding (IBB) domain of SPN1 (1-65) at 2.8-A resolution reveals that Imp beta adopts an open conformation, which is unique for a functional Imp beta/cargo complex, and rather surprisingly, it resembles the conformation of the Imp beta/RanGTP complex. As binding of RanGTP to Imp beta usually triggers the release of import complexes from the NPC, we propose that by already mimicking a conformation similar to Imp beta/RanGTP the independent dissociation of Imp beta/SPN1 from the nuclear basket is energetically aided.",M2
