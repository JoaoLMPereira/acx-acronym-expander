20145112,"High-risk neuroblastoma tumors with 11q-deletion display a poor prognostic, chromosome instability phenotype with later onset.Analysis of chromosomal aberrations is used to determine the prognosis of neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) and to aid treatment decisions. MYCN amplification (MNA) alone is an incomplete poor prognostic factor, and chromosome 11q status has recently been included in risk classification. We analyzed 165 NB tumors using high-density SNP microarrays and specifically compared the high-risk groups defined by MNA (n = 37) and 11q-deletion (n = 21). Median patient age at diagnosis was 21 months for MNA tumors and 42 months for 11q-deletion tumors, and median survival time after diagnosis was 16 months for MNA and 40 months for 11q deletion. Overall survival (at 8 years) was approximately 35% in both groups. MNA and 11q deletion were almost mutually exclusive; only one case harbored both aberrations. The numbers of segmental aberrations differed significantly; the MNA group had a median of four aberrations, whereas the 11q-deletion group had 12. The high frequency of chromosomal breaks in the 11q-deletion group is suggestive of a chromosomal instability phenotype gene located in 11q; one such gene, H2AFX, is located in 11q23.3 (within the 11q-deletion region). Furthermore, in the groups with segmental aberrations without MNA or 11q deletion, the tumors with 17q gain have worse prognosis than those with segmental aberrations without 17q gain, which have a favorable outcome. This study has implications for therapy in different risk groups and stresses that genome-wide microarray analyses should be included in clinical management to fully evaluate risk, aid diagnosis, and guide treatment.",M1
20101209,"Molecular pathogenesis of peripheral neuroblastic tumors.Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal cancer of the sympathetic nervous system observed in early childhood, characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical behaviors, ranging from spontaneous regression to fatal outcome despite aggressive therapies. NB accounts for 8-10% of pediatric cancers and 15% of the deaths attributable to malignant conditions in children. Interestingly, NB may occur in various contexts, being mostly sporadic but also familial or syndromic. This review focuses on recent advances in the identification of the genes and mechanisms implicated in NB pathogenesis. Although the extensive characterization of the genomic aberrations recurrently observed in sporadic <e>NBs</e> provides important insights into the understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of this neoplasm, analysis of familial and syndromic cases also unravels essential clues on the genetic bases of NB. Recently, the ALK gene emerged as an important NB gene, being implicated both in sporadic and familial cases. The identification of gene expression signatures associated with patient's outcome points out the potential of using gene expression profiling to improve clinical management of patients suffering from NB. Finally, based on recent observations integrating genomic analyses, biological data and clinical information, we discuss possible evolution/progression schemes in NB.",M1
20006005,"Risks and benefits of ending of mass screening for neuroblastoma at 6 months of age in Japan.PURPOSE: The mass screening (MS) for neuroblastoma (NB) at 6 months of age in Japan was discontinued in 2004. This study assessed the risks and benefits of MS based on an analysis of NB detected before or after discontinuation of MS in Japan. METHODS: The clinical features and Brodeur's genetic type based on MYCN, DNA ploidy, and other genetic aberrations were assessed in 113 NB patients (20 cases after and 93 cases [55 MS cases] before the discontinuation of MS) older than 6 months treated at one institution since 1985. RESULTS: The 20 patients with <e>NBs</e> detected after MS was discontinued ranged in age from 7 to 67 months, 12 patients were stage 4, and 11 patients would have been detected at 6 months of age if they had undergone MS. The Brodeur's genetic type of these 20 patients showed that 30% (6/20) were type 1 (low risk), 55% (11/20) were type 2A (intermediate risk), and 15% (3/20) were type 2B (high risk). Of 93 patients with NB detected before MS was discontinued, 60% (56/93) were type 1, 18% (17/93) were type 2A, and 22% (20/93) were type 2B. Among the type 2A patients, 82% (9/11) of the patients detected after MS was discontinued showed stage 4, whereas only 50% (9/18) of those diagnosed before MS was discontinued were stage 4. The genetic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for type 2A showed that the pattern of genetic aberration was equivalent in those detected either before or after MS was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease of type 1 and an increase of type 2A NB in patients after MS was discontinued in Japan. These results suggest that most of the type 1 detected by MS has regressed, and most of the type 2A detected by MS has appeared sporadically as advanced NB in patients older than 1 year.",M1
19787053,"Lysosomal-associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5 gene (LAPTM5) is associated with spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas.BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequently occurring solid tumor in children, and shows heterogeneous clinical behavior. Favorable tumors, which are usually detected by mass screening based on increased levels of catecholamines in urine, regress spontaneously via programmed cell death (PCD) or mature through differentiation into benign ganglioneuroma (GN). In contrast, advanced-type NB tumors often grow aggressively, despite intensive chemotherapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PCD during spontaneous regression in favorable NB tumors, as well as identifying genes with a pro-death role, is a matter of urgency for developing novel approaches to the treatment of advanced-type NB tumors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that the expression of lysosomal associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) was usually down-regulated due to DNA methylation in an NB cell-specific manner, but up-regulated in degenerating NB cells within locally regressing areas of favorable tumors detected by mass-screening. Experiments in vitro showed that not only a restoration of its expression but also the accumulation of LAPTM5 protein, was required to induce non-apoptotic cell death with autophagic vacuoles and lysosomal destabilization with lysosomal-membrane permeabilization (LMP) in a caspase-independent manner. While autophagy is a membrane-trafficking pathway to degrade the proteins in lysosomes, the LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization with LMP leads to an interruption of autophagic flux, resulting in the accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles, p62/SQSTM1, and ubiqitinated proteins as substrates of autophagic degradation. In addition, ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies appeared in degenerating NB cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel molecular mechanism for PCD with the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles due to LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization. LAPTM5-induced cell death is lysosomal cell death with impaired autophagy, not cell death by autophagy, so-called autophagic cell death. Thus LAPTM5-mediated PCD is closely associated with the spontaneous regression of <e>NBs</e> and opens new avenues for exploring innovative clinical interventions for this tumor.",M1
19615087,"Regulation of MYCN expression in human neuroblastoma cells.BACKGROUND: Amplification of the MYCN gene in neuroblastoma (NB) is associated with a poor prognosis. However, MYCN-amplification does not automatically result in higher expression of MYCN in children with NB. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between MYCN gene expression and prognosis in these children might be explained by the expression of either MYCN-opposite strand (MYCNOS) or the shortened MYCN-isoform (DeltaMYCN) that was recently identified in fetal tissues. Both MYCNOS and DeltaMYCN are potential inhibitors of MYCN either at the mRNA or at the protein level. METHODS: Expression of MYCN, MYCNOS and DeltaMYCN was measured in human NB tissues of different stages. Transcript levels were quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (QPCR). In addition, relative expression of these three transcripts was compared to the number of MYCN copies, which was determined by genomic real-time PCR (gQPCR). RESULTS: Both DeltaMYCN and MYCNOS are expressed in all <e>NBs</e> examined. In NBs with MYCN-amplification, these transcripts are significantly higher expressed. The ratio of MYCN:DeltaMYCN expression was identical in all tested NBs. This indicates that DeltaMYCN and MYCN are co-regulated, which suggests that DeltaMYCN is not a regulator of MYCN in NB. However, the ratio of MYCNOS:MYCN expression is directly correlated with NB disease stage (p = 0.007). In the more advanced NB stages and NBs with MYCN-amplification, relatively more MYCNOS is present as compared to MYCN. Expression of the antisense gene MYCNOS might be relevant to the progression of NB, potentially by directly inhibiting MYCN transcription by transcriptional interference at the DNA level. CONCLUSION: The MYCNOS:MYCN-ratio in NBs is significantly correlated with both MYCN-amplification and NB-stage. Our data indicate that in NB, MYCN expression levels might be influenced by MYCNOS but not by DeltaMYCN.",M1
19584241,"Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by inhibitor SAM486A connects polyamine metabolism with p53-Mdm2-Akt/protein kinase B regulation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma.S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is an essential enzyme of polyamine (PA) biosynthesis, and both AdoMetDC and PA levels are often up-regulated in cancer cells. The second-generation inhibitor SAM486A inhibits AdoMetDC enzyme activity and has been evaluated in phase II clinical cancer trials. However, little is known about the mechanism of action and potential use of this therapeutic drug in the treatment of the pediatric cancer neuroblastoma (NB). Here, we show that p53 wild-type NB cells are highly sensitive to SAM486A treatment. Most notably, SAM486A treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of proapoptotic proteins p53 and Mdm2. Concomitant with the increase of proteins at endogenous levels, the in vivo phosphorylation of p53 at residues Ser(46)/Ser(392) and Mdm2 at residue Ser(166) was observed. Moreover, the antiapoptotic protein Akt/protein kinase B was down-regulated and also dephosphorylated at residue Ser(473) in a dose- and time-dependent manner and NB cells entered apoptotic cell death. The results presented in this study highlight the importance of PA homeostasis and provide a direct link between PA metabolism and apoptotic cell signaling pathways in p53 wild-type NB cells. PA inhibitors such as SAM486A may be effective alternative agents for the treatment of <e>NBs</e> with or without MYCN amplification.",M1
19348682,"Co-regulated expression of HAND2 and DEIN by a bidirectional promoter with asymmetrical activity in neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: HAND2, a key regulator for the development of the sympathetic nervous system, is located on chromosome 4q33 in a head-to-head orientation with DEIN, a recently identified novel gene with stage specific expression in primary neuroblastoma (NB). Both genes are expressed in primary NB as well as most NB cell lines and are separated by a genomic sequence of 228 bp. The similar expression profile of both genes suggests a common transcriptional regulation mediated by a bidirectional promoter. RESULTS: Northern Blot analysis of DEIN and HAND2 in 20 primary <e>NBs</e> indicated concurrent expression levels of the two genes, which was confirmed by microarray analysis of 236 primary NBs (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.65). While DEIN expression in the latter cohort was associated with stage 4S (p = 0.02), HAND2 expression was not associated with tumor stage. In contrast, both HAND2 and DEIN transcript levels were highly associated with age at diagnosis &lt;12 months (p = 0.001). The intergenic region shows substantial homology in different species (89%, 72% and 53% identity between human and mouse, chicken and zebrafish, respectively) and contains many highly conserved putative transcription factor binding sites. Using luciferase reporter gene constructs, asymmetrical bidirectional promoter activity was found in four NB cell lines: In DEIN orientation, an average 3.4 fold increase in activity was observed as compared to the promoterless vector, whereas an average 15.4 fold activation was detected in HAND2 orientation. The presence of two highly conserved putative regulatory elements, one of which was shown to enhance HAND2 expression in branchial arches previously, displayed weak repressor activity for both genes. CONCLUSION: HAND2 and DEIN represent a gene pair that is tightly linked by a bidirectional promoter in an evolutionary highly conserved manner. Expression of both genes in NB is co-regulated by asymmetrical activity of this promoter and modulated by the activity of two cis-regulatory elements acting as weak repressors. The concurrent quantitative and tissue specific expression of HAND2 and DEIN suggests a functional link between both genes.",M1
19011468,"Rare occurrence of PHOX2b mutations in sporadic neuroblastomas.Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) are frequent solid tumors in childhood for which no specific genetic marker linked to their development has been identified to date. PHOX2b, which regulates the autonomic neuron development, has been associated with the development of autonomic diseases, and has been considered a potential candidate gene for neural crest-derived tumors such as NB. To ascertain the role of the PHOX2b gene in NB development, we have sequenced the complete PHOX2b coding region in tumors from 69 patients with sporadic NB, while 130 blood donors served as negative controls and 9 NB cell lines as positive controls. We found a missense deletion in exon 3 in a cell line. A further silent mutation in exon 3 (c.870C&gt;A) was observed in 3 tumors but in none of the controls. A new polymorphism in intron 1 (IVS1-114 G&gt;A) was observed in 31 tumor samples (44.9%) and in 68 controls (52.3%). We did not find any conclusive association of the polymorphisms or mutations in PHOX2b with the development of NB, although the large confidence intervals neither substantiate nor exclude a role for this gene in the tumor etiology.",M1
18923191,"Presence of 1q gain and absence of 7p gain are new predictors of local or metastatic relapse in localized resectable neuroblastoma.We have addressed the search of novel genetic prognostic markers in a selected cohort of patients with stroma-poor localized resectable neuroblastoma (NB) who underwent relapse or progression (group 1) or complete remission (group 2) over a minimum follow-up of 32 months from diagnosis. Twenty-three Italian patients with localized resectable NB (stages 1 and 2) diagnosed from 1994 through 2005 were studied. All patients received surgical treatment. Chemotherapy was administered only to the three stage 2 patients who had MYCN-amplified tumors. High-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) DNA copy-number analysis technology was used to identify novel prognostic markers. Chromosome 1p36.22p36.32 loss and 1q22qter gain, detected almost exclusively in group 1 patients, were significantly associated with poor event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.024, respectively). In contrast, patients with 7p11.2p22 gain, who belonged predominantly to group 2, had a significantly better EFS (p = 0.015). The frequency of 17q gain or 3p and 11q losses did not differ significantly in group 1 versus group 2 <e>NBs</e>. The sensitive technique allowed us to define the smallest region of 1p deletion. In conclusion, 1q22qter gain and 7p11.2p22 gain might represent new prognostic markers in localized resectable NB, but the small study size and the retrospective nature of the findings warrant further validation of the results in larger studies.",M1
18520032,"Useful markers for detecting minimal residual disease in cases of neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma (NB), which is a malignant tumor of young children derived from neural crest cells that occurs in children, exhibits a wide range of clinical behaviors, from spontaneous regression to rapid progression. Advanced NB patients have a poor prognosis, and recently, autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) have been attempted to improve the prognosis of these patients. In this study, we attempted to detect the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuroendocrine protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, ELAVL-4 and GD2 synthetase (GALGT), all of which are highly expressed in <e>NBs</e>, by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique in order to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). Analysis of various tumor cell lines (Ewing's sarcoma, hepatoma, leukemias, and breast cancer cell lines in addition to NBs), and human normal samples (BM and PB cells) revealed that TH was the most specific marker for the detection of NB. On the other hand, PGP9.5 was the most sensitive marker, and was detected even when there was only one positive cell per 10(7) negative cells. We concluded that TH is a better marker before the diagnosis of NB while PGP9.5 is a better marker to detect MRD after the diagnosis. Here, we describe our results on useful markers to detect MRD in patients with NB.",M1
18281664,"Clinical significance of MYCN amplification and ploidy in favorable-stage neuroblastoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.PURPOSE: MYCN amplification is rarely detected in patients with favorable-stage neuroblastoma (NB). To determine the clinical significance of MYCN amplification in children with favorable-stage NB, we performed a retrospective review of data from the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) biology study 9047. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MYCN status, tumor cell ploidy, treatment, and outcome of patients with stage A, B, or Ds NB, enrolled on POG 9047 between 1990 and 1999 were analyzed. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall (OS) survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 1,667 patients enrolled on POG 9047, 643 had favorable-stage disease. Of these, follow-up data were available on 568 (34%) with stage A, B, or Ds disease and normal MYCN copy number, and 32 (1.9%) patients with MYCN-amplified, stage A, B, or Ds tumors. Within the cohort lacking MYCN amplification, the 7-year EFS and OS rates (+/- SE) were 91% +/- 1% and 96% +/- 1%, respectively. Patients with MYCN amplification had significantly worse EFS and OS (50% +/- 9% and 59% +/- 9%, respectively, P &lt; .0001). Within the cohort of children with MYCN amplification, the 7-year EFS and OS rates were 80% +/- 10% and 87% +/- 9%, respectively for patients with hyperdiploid tumors and 25% +/- 11% and 38% +/- 12% for patients with diploid/hypodiploid <e>NBs</e> (P = .0063 and P = .0074, respectively). CONCLUSION: Tumor cell ploidy may be a clinically useful factor for prognostication and treatment stratification in children with MYCN-amplified, favorable-stage NB tumors.",M1
18268541,"Differentiation induced by physiological and pharmacological stimuli leads to increased antigenicity of human neuroblastoma cells.Sympathetic neuronal differentiation is associated with favorable prognosis of neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extra-cranial solid tumor of early childhood. Differentiation agents have proved useful in clinical protocols of NB treatment, but using them as a sole treatment is not sufficient to induce tumor elimination in patients. Therefore, complementary approaches, such as immunotherapy, are warranted. Here we demonstrate that differentiation of NB cell lines and ex vivo isolated tumor cells in response to physiological or pharmacological stimuli is associated with acquisition of increased antigenicity. This manifests as increased expression of surface major histocompatibility class I complexes and ICAM-1 molecules and translates into increased sensitivity of NB cells to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. The latter is paralleled by enhanced ability of differentiated cells to form immune conjugates and bind increased amounts of granzyme B to the cell surface. We demonstrate, for the first time, that, regardless of the stimulus applied, the differentiation state in <e>NBs</e> is associated with increased tumor antigenicity that enables more efficient elimination of tumor cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes and paves the way for combined application of differentiation-inducing agents and immunotherapy as an auxiliary approach in NB patients.",M1
18262346,"Anti-neuroblastoma activity of Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin is superior to that of other differentiating compounds in vitro.Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is difficult. Novel therapeutics improving survival rates are urgently required. We have previously shown that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin induces differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells. Here, we show that HC-toxin inhibits the growth of both established NB cell lines and primary cultures with and without amplified MYCN stronger than retinoids (RAs) and other HDACIs (MS-275, n-butyric acid, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, trichostatin A, valproic acid). Nanomolar dosages suppress E2F-1, N-myc, Skp2, Mad2 and survivin proteins, found at high levels in high-risk <e>NBs</e>, more efficiently than both RAs and other HDACIs. The level of hypophosphorylated active retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein is increased most effectively. HC-toxin's epoxy group is essential for inhibiting HDACs and promoting anti-NB activity. Without this functional group, those cellular effects are not observed. In conclusion, the anti-NB activity of HC-toxin is superior to that of RAs and that of all other HDACIs tested.",M1
18230126,"New miRNAs cloned from neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of gene expression regulators implicated in cancer biology. Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumour consisting of neural crest-derived undifferentiated cells and is characterised by variable clinical courses ranging from spontaneous regression to therapy-resistant progression. Recent advances identified a subset of miRNAs with putative function in NB biology. However, the full repertoire of miRNAs expressed in <e>NBs</e> is not available. RESULTS: We describe miRNA profiles of 13 NB specimens and 2 NB cell lines as determined by miRNA cloning. A total of 3153 sequences were sequenced and analysed by a miRNA prediction tool (miRpredict). Our library covered 27% miRNAs known to date. 39 reads corresponding to 25 individual sequences were classified as novel miRNAs, including miRNA* species of 10 known miRNAs. Expression of 5 new miRNA* forms and 8 individual sequences was supported by Northern blotting. Most of the novel miRNA genes are not related to each other and do not share homology with the annotated sequences in the public miRNA database, but they are conserved within mammals or have close homologues in primates genomes. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for 29 new miRNA and miRNA-like sequences (24 novel sequences and 5 miRNAs discovered initially in other species). Some of these newly identified sequences reside within frequently altered chromosomal regions in NB tumours and may play a role in NB biology.",M1
18082705,"Classification of neuroblastomas based on an analysis of the expression of genes related to prognosis.PURPOSE: To select the optimal treatment according to the grade of malignancy of neuroblastoma (NB), it is essential to accurately and rapidly identify genetic abnormalities associated with the prognosis. We have identified BIN1 and neuronatin beta as the novel prognosis-related genes for <e>NBs</e>. This study aims to assess the correlation between the combination of the expression level of prognosis-related genes and the outcome of NB. METHODS: In 44 NB samples, the expression levels of TrkA, BIN1, and neuronatin beta were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; furthermore, the correlation between the expression of these genes' expression levels and the clinical progression of NB were assessed. RESULTS: It was possible to classify 44 NBs into 4 groups regarding the grade of malignancy of NB. These 4 groups were all significantly associated with the clinical stages international NB staging system as well as the outcomes of the patients (P &lt; .001, according to the trend test by Kruskal-Wallis exact test). CONCLUSION: The combination of the expression levels of these genes using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is indicated as the effective method to quickly and accurately evaluate the grade of malignancy of NBs.",M1
18074352,"Histone deacetylase inhibitor Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin suppresses the malignant phenotype of neuroblastoma cells.The survival rate of children with advanced neuroblastoma (NB) is dismal despite intensive multimodal therapy. The limited efficacy and the frequent and serious side effects of currently used therapeutic regimens necessitate the development of new, less toxic treatment strategies. This study shows that the histone deacetylase inhibitor Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin suppresses the malignant phenotype of both established NB cell lines and primary NB cells with and without amplified MYCN at dosages lower than 20 nM. HC-toxin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as well as neuronal differentiation and diminishes both colony formation and invasive growth. These cellular changes are accompanied by the transcriptional repression of cell cycle regulators of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor network found at high levels in <e>NBs</e> with poor prognosis, like E2F-1 and its targets Skp2, N-myc, Mad2 and survivin. The levels of the hypophosphorylated active form of RB, and of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors including p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), p21(cip1/waf-1) and p27(kip1) are increased. In conclusion, nanomolar doses of the HDACI HC-toxin cause a shift to a differentiated and benign phenotype of NB cells that is associated with an activation of the RB tumor suppressor network.",M1
18057715,"Analyses of novel prognostic factors in neuroblastoma patients.Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant solid tumor in childhood. There are well-recognized prognostic factors in NB such as age at diagnosis, organ of origin, stages, MYCN gene amplification, and expression of H-ras, trkA and survivin. Moreover, we investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), p53, stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit of its receptor with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 22 <e>NBs</e> and 4 other tumors (one malignant lymphoma, one malignant teratoma, and 2 rhabdomyosarcomas) samples. The correlation between patients' prognoses and the expression of TH or c-kit was newly recognized, particularly the good prognosis in patients in whom c-kit highly expressed and the poor prognosis contrarily associated with low or no expression, although the SCF of its ligand had no relationship with patient prognosis. It is possible that tumors without c-kit expression can not react with SCF (via the autocrine or paracrine system) and remain immature. It may be that this is a new critical clinical event in NB patients.",M1
17940511,"Genetic and epigenetic changes in the common 1p36 deletion in neuroblastoma tumours.Chromosome 1p is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma (NB) tumours. The commonly deleted region has been narrowed down by loss of heterozygosity studies undertaken by different groups. Based on earlier mapping data, we have focused on a region on 1p36 (chr1: 7 765 595-11 019 814) and performed an analysis of 30 genes by exploring features such as epigenetic regulation, that is DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, mutations at the DNA level and mRNA expression. Treatment of NB cell lines with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A led to increased gene transcription of four of the 30 genes, ERRFI1 (MIG-6), PIK3CD, RBP7 (CRBPIV) and CASZ1, indicating that these genes could be affected by epigenetic downregulation in <e>NBs</e>. Two patients with nonsynonymous mutations in the PIK3CD gene were detected. One patient harboured three variations in the same exon, and p.R188W. The other patient had the variation p.M655I. In addition, synonymous variations and one variation in an intronic sequence were also found. The mRNA expression of this gene is downregulated in unfavourable, compared to favourable, NBs. One nonsynonymous mutation was also identified in the ERRFI1 gene, p.N343S, and one synonymous. None of the variations above were found in healthy control individuals. In conclusion, of the 30 genes analysed, the PIK3CD gene stands out as one of the most interesting for further studies of NB development and progression.",M1
17926102,"Laparoscopic resection of abdominal neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: Since indications for laparoscopic adrenalectomy have progressively expanded to pediatric surgery, preliminary reports have studied the laparoscopic approach for abdominal neuroblastoma (NB). We aimed to report on the indications and the results of laparoscopic resection in a large series of abdominal <e>NBs</e>. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study included 45 children with abdominal NBs (28 localized, 11 stage 4, 6 stage 4s) and laparoscopic resection of their abdominal primary tumor. Primary site of the tumor was the adrenal gland in 41 cases and retroperitoneal space in 4. The median age at surgery was 12 months (1-122); median tumor size was 37 mm (12-70). Resection was performed through transperitoneal laparoscopy (n = 38) or retroperitoneoscopy (n = 7). RESULTS: Complete macroscopic resection was achieved in 43 of 45 children (96%). The median duration of pneumoperitoneum was 70 min (30-160), and the length of hospital stay was 3 days (2-9). Four procedures (9%) were converted to open surgery, and tumor rupture occurred in three cases. Of the 28 children with localized disease, there was a 96% overall survival (OS) rate after a median follow-up of 28 months (4-94). There was one local relapse in this subgroup, with subsequent complete remission. For the entire 45-children cohort, four children died and three presented a recurrence resulting in OS, disease-free survival, and event-free survival rates of 84% +/- 8.1, 84% +/- 8.2, and 77% +/- 9.1 respectively. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resection of abdominal primary allows effective local control of the disease in a wide range of clinical situations of neuroblastoma, with an acceptable morbidity.",M1
17724465,"Deregulated Wnt/beta-catenin program in high-risk neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification.Neuroblastoma (NB) is a frequently lethal tumor of childhood. MYCN amplification accounts for the aggressive phenotype in a subset while the majority have no consistently identified molecular aberration but frequently express MYC at high levels. We hypothesized that activated Wnt/beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling might account for this as MYC is a beta-catenin transcriptional target and multiple embryonal and neural crest malignancies have oncogenic alterations in this pathway. NB cell lines without MYCN amplification express higher levels of MYC and beta-catenin (with aberrant nuclear localization) than MYCN-amplified cell lines. Evidence for aberrant beta-catenin-TCF transcriptional activity was demonstrated using expression profiles from 73 primary <e>NBs</e>. Findings included increased WNT ligands (WNT1, WNT6, WNT7A, WNT10B), DVL1 and TCF7 expression in high-risk NBs without MYCN amplification, consistent with canonical beta-catenin signaling. More directly, Patterns of Gene Expression and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses demonstrated beta-catenin target genes (for example, MYC, PPARD, NRCAM, CD44, TCF7) as coordinately upregulated in high-risk NBs without MYCN amplification in comparison to high-risk MYCN-amplified or intermediate-risk NBs, supporting pathway activation in this subset. Thus, high-risk NBs without MYCN amplification may deregulate MYC and other oncogenic genes via altered beta-catenin signaling providing a potential candidate pathway for therapeutic inhibition.",M1
17570703,"Methylation of tumor-suppressor genes in neuroblastoma: The RASSF1A gene is almost always methylated in primary tumors.BACKGROUND: Currently, the best characterized genetic aberration in neuroblastoma (NB) is MYCN amplification, which has been clearly related to prognosis. In the present study, we investigated whether specific epigenetic alterations are associated with stage of disease. PROCEDURE: Sixty-two <e>NBs</e> (45 primary tumors and 17 NBs at relapse) were studied in terms of the methylation status of 19 genes (p15INK4a, p16INK4a, p14ARF, APC, RB1, RASSF1A, BLU, FHIT, RARbeta, INI1, TIMP3, NF2, MGMT, DAPK, FLIP, ECAD, CASP8, and the receptors DcR1 and DcR2). RESULTS: At diagnosis, we found hypermethylation of RASSF1A in 93% of these tumors, hypermethylation of TIMP3 in 51%, of CASP8 in 38%, of BLU in 34%, of DcR2 in 25%, and of DcR1 in 11%. All 17 tumors tested at relapse showed hypermethylation of RASSF1A (100%), while 10 showed hypermethylation of TIMP3 (59%), six of CASP8 (35%), five of DcR2 (29%), four of BLU (24%), and three of DcR1 (18%). Hypermethylation was related to clinical stage; NBs at stages 1, 2, and 4s were less frequently methylated than stages 3 and 4 disease (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: These results from our series indicate that hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes may be important in the development and evolution of NB. These epigenetic alterations could be used as a marker of the disease and genes regulating methylation should be considered as possible therapeutic targets in NB.",M1
17533365,"Epigenetic silencing of prostaglandin E receptor 2 (PTGER2) is associated with progression of neuroblastomas.We previously identified a cluster of prostanoid receptor genes, prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR) and prostaglandin E receptor 2 (PTGER2), as possible targets for DNA methylation in advanced types of neuroblastoma (NB) using bacterial artificial chromosome array-based methylated CpG island amplification method. Among them, in this study, we found that PTGER2 was frequently silenced in NB cell lines, especially in those with MYCN amplification, through epigenetic mechanisms. In NB cell lines, DNA methylation pattern within a part of CpG island was inversely correlated with PTGER2 expression, and histone H3 and H4 deacetylation and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation within the putative promoter region were more directly correlated with silencing of this gene. Methylation of PTGER2 was observed more frequently in advanced-type of primary <e>NBs</e> compared with early-stage tumors. Growth of NB cells lacking endogenous PTGER2 expression was inhibited by restoration of the gene product by transient and stable transfection. A PTGER2-selective agonist, butaprost, increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level, inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis of NB cells stably expressing exogenous PTGER2. 8-Bromo-cAMP also inhibited growth of NB cells lacking PTGER2 expression, but not cells expressing this gene. Taken together, it is suggested that NB cells may lose responsiveness to PTGER2-mediated growth inhibition/apoptosis through epigenetic silencing of PTGER2 and/or disruption of downstream cAMP-dependent pathway during the neuroblastomagenesis.",M1
17243159,"Comprehensive analysis of tumoral DNA content reveals clonal ploidy heterogeneity as a marker with prognostic significance in locoregional neuroblastoma.The clinical management of locoregional neuroblastoma (LR NB) is controversial. In a previous study we showed that diploidy was a strong prognostic predictor of outcome and detected the existence of clonal ploidy heterogeneity in a select group of cases. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the frequency of ploidy heterogeneity in LR NB, (2) to ascertain the best method to detect heteterogeneity, and (3) to correlate ploidy populations with clinical outcome. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of tumoral DNA content in 38 LR <e>NBs</e> comparing (1) flow cytometry (FCM), (2) karyotyping, (3) interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and (4) laser-scanning cytometry (LSC). Tumor ploidy heterogeneity was found by all methodologies. By FCM, all tumors with aneuploid peaks had detectable diploid DNA peaks. By LSC, all tumors with diploid and hyperploid peaks were GD2-positive in both, consistent with their tumoral origin. A predominant near-triploid clonal population (ratio diploid vs. triploid, &lt;2.5) was observed in most nonprogressing LR NB tumors, and a predominant diploid clone (ratio di- vs. triploid, &gt;2.5) in most progressing LR NB cases. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of tumor ploidy assayed by different methods versus age, INSS (International Neuroblastoma Staging System) stage, and MYCN status. FCM was the most powerful prognostic factor related to poor prognosis (overall survival, P = 0.02; progression-free survival, P = 0.01). These results provide strong evidence for clonal ploidy heterogeneity in LR NB and clonal evolution toward diploidy in progressing LR NB.",M1
17028906,"Relationship of DDX1 and NAG gene amplification/overexpression to the prognosis of patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.PURPOSE: Amplification of the MYCN gene strongly correlates with advanced stage, rapid tumor progression and poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (NB). Several genes in the MYCN amplicon, including the DEAD box polypeptide 1 (DDX1) gene, and neuroblastoma-amplified gene (NAG gene), have been found to be frequently co-amplified with MYCN in NB. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic significance of the co-amplification or overexpression of DDX1 and NAG with MYCN. PROCEDURE: The gene copy numbers and mRNA expression levels of MYCN, DDX1, and NAG in 113 primary <e>NBs</e> were determined by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or quantitative reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay. The relationships between gene co-amplification/overexpression status and stage, age at diagnosis, and overall survival were analyzed. RESULTS: For evaluating the frequency of DDX1 and NAG co-amplification, it proved appropriate to discriminate NBs with &lt;40 copies of MYCN amplification from those with &gt; or =40 copies of MYCN (DDX1, p = 0.00058; NAG, p = 0.0242, chi(2) for independence test). In patients with MYCN-amplified NB aged &gt; or =18 months, those with tumor with enhanced DDX1 expression and low-NAG expression showed a significantly better outcome than those with low-DDX1 expression or enhanced NAG expression (p = 0.0245, log-rank test). None of the gene expression statuses had a significant relation to disease stage or survival for patients &lt;18 months old. No relationship between any gene co-amplification status and disease stage, age at diagnosis, or overall survival was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there may be a subset of NB in which enhanced DDX1 and low-NAG expression consequent to DDX1 co-amplification without NAG amplification contributes to susceptibility to intensive therapy. A larger study using an age cut-off of 18 months will be required.",M1
16941154,"Prognostic value of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification in Neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor) and comparison with other prognostic factors: a study of 182 cases from the Spanish Neuroblastoma Registry.In addition to clinical and biological factors, further valuable prognostic information in neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor) (NB) patients is provided by the histopathologic analysis and the application of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) system. The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of the INPC classification in a series of NB (Schwannian stroma-poor) and its relation with other prognostic factors. One hundred eighty-two cases of NB were collected from the files of the Spanish Neuroblastoma Registry. Slides were reviewed, and NB cases were grouped into favorable and unfavorable categories according to INPC criteria, taking into account morphological features (mitosis-karyorrhexis index, histological subtype) and patient's age at diagnosis. Other pathological [presence of calcifications, tissular components, and number of mitotic cells per 10 high-power field (HPF)], immunohistochemical (P-glycoprotein and Ki-67 protein expression) and genetic (MYCN amplification and chromosome 1p deletion) features were also studied. Statistical analyses of overall survival with Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate study using Cox regression were performed (40.3% of <e>NBs</e> were considered favorable and 59.7% unfavorable). Unfavorable NB showed a mean survival time of 57 months compared with 89 months in favorable cases. Advanced stage, more than ten mitoses per 10 HPF, Ki-67 expression in more than 30% of tumor cells, MYCN oncogene amplification and chromosome 1p deletion were observed more frequently in unfavorable NB. The Cox regression analysis demonstrated that clinical stage (International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 4) and histological subtype (undifferentiated NB) were the most important factors that influence the overall survival (p&lt;0.001). INPC classification results are major prognostic indicators in NB and should be considered in the therapeutic stratification of NB patients.",M1
16506218,"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene expression level has prognostic value in neuroblastoma.Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 are often observed in a specific subset of aggressive neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) with loss of distal 11q and without MYCN amplification. The critical deleted region encompasses the locus of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL, 3p25). Constitutional loss of function mutations in the VHL gene are responsible for the VHL syndrome, a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of neoplasms, including pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are, like NB, derived from neural crest cells, but, unlike NB, consist of more mature chromaffin cells instead of immature neuroblasts. Further arguments for a putative role of VHL in NB are its function as oxygen sensitizer and the reported relation between hypoxia and dedifferentiation of NB cells, leading to a more aggressive phenotype. To test the possible involvement of VHL in NB, we did mRNA expression analysis and sought evidence for VHL gene inactivation. Although no evidence for a classic tumor suppressor role for VHL in NB could be obtained, a strong correlation was observed between reduced levels of VHL mRNA and low patient survival probability (p=0.013). Furthermore, VHL appears to have predictive power in NTRK1 (TRKA) positive tumor samples with presumed favorable prognosis, which makes it a potentially valuable marker for more accurate risk assessment in this subgroup of patients. The significance of the reduced VHL expression levels in relation to NB tumor biology remains unexplained, as functional analysis demonstrated no clear effect of the reduction in VHL mRNA expression on protein stability of its downstream target hypoxia-inducible factor alpha.",M1

As new technologies are developed, the number of conditions amenable to newborn screening (<e>NBS</e>) will continue to expand. Despite the scope of these programs, the evidence base for a number of NBS applications remains relatively weak. This article briefly reviews the evidence base for several conditions. The article then develops a proposal for a structured sequence of research protocols to evaluate potential applications for NBS before their formal implementation in public health programs. Such a framework for research will require collaboration between states and the federal government, a collaboration that is emerging through recent federal legislation and funding.",M1
15913885,"Diversity in neuroblastomas and discrimination of the risk to progress.The clinical diversity of Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) was discriminated into three groups with high sensitivity and specificity to patient's outcome. The 'high risk' NB is defined with any of following conditions, MYCN amplification or unfavorable histology of International Neuroblastoma Pathological Classification (INPC) or low Ha-ras/trk A expression. The 'low risk' NB is defined with all following conditions, single copy of MYCN and INPC favorable histology and high Ha-ras/trk A expression and localized tumor. The remaining NBs were classified into 'intermediate risk' ones. According to these criteria, the diversity of the 248 mass-screening NBs was shown with variety progressive risk; 40% were classified in low risk group, 25% were in high risk group and 35% were in intermediate risk group.",M1
15802787,"Significance of survivin mRNA expression in prognosis of neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant solid tumor in childhood, and among all childhood malignancies is second in prevalence only to leukemia. In NB we need to both make an accurate diagnosis and rapidly analyze the expression of genetic prognostic factors such as MYCN, H-ras, and trkA. Moreover, it has recently become important to analyze the expression of survivin mRNA, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Expression of the survivin gene is related to tumorigenesis and inhibition of apoptosis in some malignant tumors. We investigated its expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in NB cell lines (SK-N-SH, NB-39, and IMR-32), two normal blood cell samples, and 13 clinical NB tumor samples. All three NB cell lines had high levels of mRNA expression for this gene, but normal blood cells had no expression. We detected expression of survivin mRNA in 7 of the 13 NB tumor samples (54%). Two NB patients were in stage I disease, 6 in stage II, and 5 in stage IV(A). Quantitative analysis by RT-PCR revealed that the ratio between survivin mRNA and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (h-GAPDH) mRNA was very low in stages I and II (0-0.017). In contrast, in advanced <e>NBs</e> (stage IV(A)) the ratio was much higher (0-0.050). The prognoses of the three patients in the advanced stage who had high ratios of expression were poor. A high level of expression of survivin mRNA indicates a high grade of malignancy, high likelihood of recurrence, and poor prognosis.",M1
15668290,"Calreticulin expression in neuroblastoma--a novel independent prognostic factor.BACKGROUND: Calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum protein, has been reported to be essential for the differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells, suggesting that CRT may affect the tumor behavior of neuroblastoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of clinicopathologic factors and patient survival with the expression of CRT in patients with NB. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight <e>NBs</e> were investigated by immunohistochemical staining against CRT, and were divided into positive and negative immunostaining groups. Correlations between calreticulin expression, various clinicopathologic and biologic factors, and patient survival were studied. In seven tumor samples, CRT mRNAs and proteins were evaluated with real-time PCR and western blot, respectively, and correlated with immunohistochemical findings. RESULTS: Among 68 NBs, 32 (47.1%) showed positive CRT expression. Positive CRT immunostaining strongly correlated with differentiated histologies, as well as known favorable prognostic factors such as detected from mass screening, younger age (&lt; or =1 year) at diagnosis and early clinical stages, but inversely correlated with MYCN amplification. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that NB patients with CRT expression did have better survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated CRT expression to be an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, CRT expression also predicted better survival in patients with advanced-stage NBs, and its absence predicted poorer survival in patients whose tumor had no MYCN amplification. The amount of CRT mRNAs and proteins in NB tumor samples tested correlated well with the immunohistochemical expressions. CONCLUSIONS: CRT expression correlates with the differentiation of NB and predicts favorable survival, thereby suggesting CRT to be a useful indicator for planning treatment of NB.",M1
15650238,"HMGA molecules in neuroblastic tumors.The high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins are thought to work as ancillary transcription factors and to regulate the expression of a growing number of genes through direct binding to DNA or via protein-protein interactions. Both HMGA1 and HMGA2 are important regulators of basic biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and transformation. Their qualitatively or quantitatively altered expression has been described in a number of human tumors. We studied and review here their expression in neuroblastic tumors. HMGA2 is expressed only in a subset of ex vivo neuroblastoma (NB) tumors and in the embryonic adrenal gland, but it is undetectable in the adult adrenal gland, suggesting that its anomalous expression might be associated with NB tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression. In vitro, its expression is easily detectable in retinoic acid (RA)-resistant cell lines. The exogenous expression of HMGA2 is sufficient to convert RA-sensitive SY5Y NB cells into RA-resistant cells, thus suggesting that HMGA2 might be a relevant player in determining NB cell responses to endogenous or therapeutically important growth inhibitory substances. In contrast, HMGA1 expression is readily detectable in all NB cell lines and tumors, but its expression is consistently higher in less differentiated <e>NBs</e> compared with ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas. Interestingly, RA increases HMGA1 expression in RA-resistant NB cells but inhibits it in cells undergoing RA-induced growth inhibition and neuronal differentiation. Our studies indicate that HMGA molecules might be biologically and pathologically relevant factors in neuroblastic tumor development and progression.",M1
15650232,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5: contribution to growth and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood tumor that depends on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) for its growth and metastatic spread. Some metastatic <e>NBs</e> acquire independence from the paracrine support of IGF by activating autocrine production of IGF-2. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5), a member of the IGF binding protein family, is able to optimize binding between IGF itself and its receptor. NB cell lines retain the ability to differentiate in vitro toward neuronal, schwann-like or melanocytic phenotypes upon treatment with retinoic acid (RA). Retinoids are currently used in NB therapy to achieve a mature postmitotic phenotype. Here, we present evidence that the expression of IGFBP-5 is a common feature of neuroblastoma cell lines and that IGFBP-5 acts in concert with IGF-2 in inducing cell proliferation. RA-induced differentiation causes a sharp increase of IGFBP-5. Functional assays carried out in differentiating conditions demonstrate that IGFBP-5 transcription is sensitive to RA treatment. We show that the effect of RA on the IGFBP-5 promoter is exerted, at least in part, through a proximal 5'-CACCC-3' tandem repeat (-147 bp to -137 bp from the transcription start site) that has previously been described as a cis-acting element involved in the progesterone-mediated response in osteoblasts. Given the relevance of IGF-2 in determining the proliferative and metastatic behavior of NB, the role of IGFBP-5 as a modulator of the IGF signal transduction pathway should be studied further for potential therapeutic applications.",M1
15623630,"Association of epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A with poor outcome in human neuroblastoma.PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and potential clinical significance of epigenetic aberrations in neuroblastoma (NB). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The methylation status of 11 genes that are frequently epigenetically inactivated in adult cancers was assayed in 13 NB cell lines. The prevalence of RASSF1A and TSP-1 methylation was also analyzed in 56 <e>NBs</e> and 5 ganglioneuromas by methylation-specific PCR. Associations between the methylation status of RASSF1A and TSP-1 and patient age, tumor stage, tumor MYCN status, and patient survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Epigenetic changes were detected in all 13 NB cell lines, although the pattern of gene methylation varied. The putative tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A was methylated in all 13 cell lines, and TSP-1 and CASP8 were methylated in 11 of 13 cell lines. Epigenetic changes of DAPK and FAS were detected in only small numbers of cell lines, whereas none of the cell lines had methylation of p16, p21, p73, RAR-beta2, SPARC, or TIMP-3. RASSF1A was also methylated in 70% of the primary NB tumors tested, and TSP-1 methylation was detected in 55% of the tumors. RASSF1A methylation was significantly associated with age &gt;1 year (P &lt; 0.01), high-risk disease (P &lt; 0.016), and poor survival (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, no association between TSP-1 methylation and prognostic factors or survival was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A may contribute to the clinically aggressive phenotype of high-risk NB.",M1
15488758,"TrkA alternative splicing: a regulated tumor-promoting switch in human neuroblastoma.We identify a novel alternative TrkA splice variant, TrkAIII, with deletion of exons 6, 7, and 9 and functional extracellular IG-C1 and N-glycosylation domains, that exhibits expression restricted to undifferentiated early neural progenitors, human neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>), and a subset of other neural crest-derived tumors. This NGF-unresponsive isoform is oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells and promotes tumorigenic NB cell behavior in vitro and in vivo (cell survival, xenograft growth, angiogenesis) resulting from spontaneous tyrosine kinase activity and IP3K/Akt/NF-kappaB but not Ras/MAPK signaling. TrkAIII antagonizes NGF/TrkAI signaling, which is responsible for NB growth arrest and differentiation through Ras/MAPK, and its expression is promoted by hypoxia at the expense of NGF-responsive receptors, providing a mechanism for converting NGF/TrkA/Ras/MAPK antioncogenic signals to TrkAIII/IP3K/Akt/NF-kappaB tumor-promoting signals during tumor progression.",M1
15380028,"cDNA array-CGH profiling identifies genomic alterations specific to stage and MYCN-amplification in neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: Recurrent non-random genomic alterations are the hallmarks of cancer and the characterization of these imbalances is critical to our understanding of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. RESULTS: We performed array-comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH) on cDNA microarrays containing 42,000 elements in neuroblastoma (NB). We found that only two chromosomes (2p and 12q) had gene amplifications and all were in the MYCN amplified samples. There were 6 independent non-contiguous amplicons (10.4-69.4 Mb) on chromosome 2, and the largest contiguous region was 1.7 Mb bounded by NAG and an EST (clone: 757451); the smallest region was 27 Kb including an EST (clone: 241343), NCYM, and MYCN. Using a probabilistic approach to identify single copy number changes, we systemically investigated the genomic alterations occurring in Stage 1 and Stage 4 <e>NBs</e> with and without MYCN amplification (stage 1-, 4-, and 4+). We have not found genomic alterations universally present in all (100%) three subgroups of NBs. However we identified both common and unique patterns of genomic imbalance in NB including gain of 7q32, 17q21, 17q23-24 and loss of 3p21 were common to all three categories. Finally we confirm that the most frequent specific changes in Stage 4+ tumors were the loss of 1p36 with gain of 2p24-25 and they had fewer genomic alterations compared to either stage 1 or 4-, indicating that for this subgroup of poor risk NB requires a smaller number of genomic changes are required to develop the malignant phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: cDNA A-CGH analysis is an efficient method for the detection and characterization of amplicons. Furthermore we were able to detect single copy number changes using our probabilistic approach and identified genomic alterations specific to stage and MYCN amplification.",M1
15300220,"Ets transcriptional regulation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neuroblastomas.BACKGROUND: We have demonstrated that gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) binds specifically to its cell surface receptor, GRP-R, to act as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>); an increased expression of GRP-R was found in more advanced-stage NBs. Ets family proteins are nuclear targets for intracellular kinase pathways that can lead to cell proliferation; however, a potential role of Ets in the expression of GRP-R in NBs is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine whether Ets regulates transcriptional activity of GRP-R in NBs. METHODS: We identified multiple DNA-binding sites for various nuclear transcription factors in the proximal (ie, 263 bp) GRP-R promoter. Luciferase assay was performed to measure GRP-R promoter activity that contained site-specific mutations of various binding elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to determine transcription factor-binding activity. RESULTS: Mutation of a consensus Ets-binding site in the GRP-R promoter significantly decreased GRP-R promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated a decrease in Ets nuclear protein-binding activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Ets1 resulted in upregulation of GRP-R promoter activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Ets is a transcription factor that significantly contributes to the GRP-R transcription in NBs. This finding may allow us to develop novel molecular tools to downregulate expression of GRP-R and hence inhibit mitogenic effects of GRP in NBs.",M1
15231663,"Methylation-associated silencing of the heat shock protein 47 gene in human neuroblastoma.Hypermethylation of gene promoter CpG islands is a frequent mechanism for gene inactivation in a variety of human cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB). We demonstrated recently that treatment with the demethylating agent 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) significantly inhibited NB growth in vivo. In an effort to identify the genes and biological pathways that are responsible for the impaired NB tumor growth observed after treatment with 5-Aza-dC, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of control and treated NBL-W-S NB cells. We found &gt;or=3-fold changes in expression of 44 genes that play roles in angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell adhesion, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. The gene encoding heat shock protein 47 (Hsp47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperon, was up-regulated &gt;80-fold after 5-Aza-dC treatment. Expression studies confirmed that Hsp47 is silenced in a subset of NB cell lines and tumors. We also show that silencing of Hsp47 in NB cells is associated with aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands and that Hsp47 expression can be restored after treatment with 5-Aza-dC. A strong correlation between Hsp47 and collagen type I and IV expression was seen in NB cells. Interestingly, tumorigenicity was inversely correlated with the level of collagen expression in NB cell lines, and higher levels of collagen were detected in mature NB tumors that are associated with favorable outcome compared with undifferentiated, advanced-stage <e>NBs</e>. Our studies support a role for Hsp47 in the regulation of collagen type I and IV production in NB cells and suggest that the level of collagen expression may influence NB tumor phenotype.",M1
15126363,"In vivo treatment with CPT-11 leads to differentiation of neuroblastoma xenografts and topoisomerase I alterations.Topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as CPT-11, are potent anticancer drugs against neuroblastoma (NB). Differentiating agents, such as retinoids, improve the survival of children with metastatic NB. To characterize the biological effects associated with exposure to CPT-11 in vivo, athymic mice bearing a human NB xenograft, named IGR-NB8 and characterized as an immature NB with poor prognostic markers, were treated with CPT-11. Prolonged stable disease was observed, resulting in an overall tumor growth delay of 115 days. During treatment, tumors differentiated into ganglioneuroblastomas (GGNB), which reverted into an immature phenotype when treatment was discontinued. In contrast, 13-cis retinoic acid failed to induce differentiation of IGR-NB8 in vivo. Tumor differentiation was associated with decreased N-myc expression, induction of p73 expression in the perinuclear area and cytoplasm, and a dramatic 35-fold decrease in topoisomerase I (topo I) catalytic activity. The full-length Mr 100,000 topo I protein was present in both pre and post-treatment immature NB xenografts. In contrast, differentiated GGNBs did not contain the Mr 100,000 protein but an intense Mr 48,000 topo I fragment. Furthermore, redistribution of the Mr 48,000 and 68,000 forms to the cytoplasm was observed in differentiated tumors. The same pattern of topo I expression and catalytic activity was observed in <e>NBs</e> and GGNBs obtained from pediatric patients. Our data suggest that prolonged in vivo exposure to CPT-11 induces differentiation of NB xenografts, which is associated with truncation of the topo I enzyme, relocation of the degraded forms to the cytoplasm, and decreased catalytic activity.",M1
15117991,"Localized pelvic neuroblastoma: excellent survival and low morbidity with tailored therapy--the 10-year experience of the French Society of Pediatric Oncology.PURPOSE: To assess the results and morbidity of treatment of children with localized pelvic neuroblastoma (NB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive cases of localized pelvic NB registered in the French multicenter prospective studies NBL90 and NBL94 between 1990 and 1999 were reviewed. Resectability was decided on the basis of clinical and radiologic evaluation. In unresectable tumors, primary chemotherapy (combinations of carboplatin-etoposide and vincristine-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicine) was administered before surgery. RESULTS: Forty-seven children (with 26 resectable tumors and 21 unresectable) were included in this study. At the end of treatment, 31 children were in complete remission (66%). Long-term neurologic sequelae were observed in seven patients (15%), directly attributable to surgery in three cases. After a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 13 to 129 months), 44 patients are alive. Six children experienced local relapse; four of these children achieved subsequent remission. The projected overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates at 5 years are, respectively, 93% +/- 4% and 84% +/- 5%. Survival of children treated with preoperative chemotherapy are similar to those treated by primary surgery (80% and 88% respectively). The extent of surgical resection seemed to have no influence on the outcome (EFS rates 76% and 89% in case of gross residue and complete resection or microscopic residue, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the excellent survival of localized pelvic <e>NBs</e>. Considering the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy, patients with pelvic NB should be carefully screened for primary surgery. The risk of neurologic impairment during radical excision should be balanced with the good survival of children with minimal residual disease.",M1
14973077,"The Ews/Fli-1 fusion gene switches the differentiation program of neuroblastomas to Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors.Neuroblastoma (NB) and the Ewing sarcoma (ES)/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) family are pediatric cancers derived from neural crest cells. Although <e>NBs</e> display features of the sympathetic nervous system, ES/PNETs express markers consistent with parasympathetic differentiation. To examine the control of these differentiation markers, we generated NB x ES/PNET somatic cell hybrids. NB-specific markers were suppressed in the hybrids, whereas ES/PNET-specific markers were unaffected. These results suggested that the Ews/Fli-1 fusion gene, resulting from a translocation unique to ES/PNETs, might account for the loss of NB-specific markers. To test this hypothesis, we generated two different NB cell lines that stably expressed the Ews/Fli-1 gene. We observed that heterologous expression of the Ews/Fli-1 protein led to the suppression of NB-specific markers and de novo expression of ES/PNET markers. To determine the extent of changes in differentiation, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Array system to observe global transcriptional changes of genes. This analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern of the Ews/Fli-1-expressing NB cells resembled that observed in pooled ES/PNET cell lines and differed significantly from the NB parental cells. Therefore, we propose that Ews/Fli-1 contributes to the etiology of ES/PNET by subverting the differentiation program of its neural crest precursor cell to a less differentiated and more proliferative state.",M1
14735202,"SLIT2 promoter methylation analysis in neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour and renal cell carcinoma.The 3p21.3 RASSF1A tumour suppressor gene (TSG) provides a paradigm for TSGs inactivated by promoter methylation rather than somatic mutations. Recently, we identified frequent promoter methylation without somatic mutations of SLIT2 in lung and breast cancers, suggesting similarities between SLIT2 and RASSF1A TSGs. Epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A was first described in lung and breast cancers and subsequently in a wide range of human cancers including neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These findings prompted us to investigate SLIT2 methylation in these three human cancers. We analysed 49 neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>), 37 Wilms' tumours and 48 RCC, and detected SLIT2 promoter methylation in 29% of NB, 38% of Wilms' tumours and 25% of RCC. Previously, we had demonstrated frequent RASSF1A methylation in the same tumour series and frequent CASP8 methylation in the NB and Wilms' tumour samples. However, there was no significant association between SLIT2 promoter methylation and RASSF1A or CASP8 methylation in NB and RCC. In Wilms' tumour, there was a trend for a negative association between RASSF1A and SLIT2 methylation, although this did not reach statistical significance. No associations were detected between SLIT2 promoter methylation and specific clinicopathological features in the tumours analysed. These findings implicate SLIT2 promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of both paediatric and adult cancers and suggest that further investigations of SLIT2 in other tumour types should be pursued. However, epigenetic inactivation of SLIT2 is less frequent than RASSF1A in the tumour types analysed.",M1
12960121,"Expression of a MYCN-interacting isoform of the tumor suppressor BIN1 is reduced in neuroblastomas with unfavorable biological features.PURPOSE: Amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene is strongly correlated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma (NB), although deregulated MYCN is a potent inducer of apoptosis. BIN1 (2q14) encodes multiple isoforms of a Myc-interacting adaptor protein that has features of a tumor suppressor, including the ability to inhibit Myc-mediated cell transformation and to promote apoptosis. We hypothesized that BIN1 may function as a suppressor gene in NB, because Bin1 is highly expressed in neural tissues and binds the Myc Box motifs that are conserved in MycN. EXPERMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of MYCN, total BIN1, and BIN1 isoforms were determined in 56 primary <e>NBs</e> using the real-time PCR. Expression was correlated with biological and genetic features. To determine the functional significance of BIN1 expression we ectopically expressed BIN1 isoforms in NB cell lines with and without MYCN amplification, and assessed clonogenic growth. RESULTS: Four predominant BIN1 isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of exon 12A (a neural tissue-specific exon) and exon 13 (a Myc-binding domain encoding exon) were variably expressed in the 56 primary NBs. Expression of BIN1 was lower in: NBs with MYCN amplification (n = 10) compared with those without, P &lt; 0.03; in International Neuroblastoma Risk Group high-risk NB (n = 19) compared with low- or intermediate-risk NB, P &lt; 0.01; and in metastatic NB (n = 21) compared with localized NB, P &lt; 0.06. BIN1 inactivation by deletion or genomic rearrangement was identified infrequently. Forced expression of BIN1 isoforms containing the Myc-binding domain (with or without exon 12A) inhibited colony formation in NB cell lines with MYCN amplification (P &lt; 0.01) but not in those without. Forced expression of BIN1 isoforms with a MBD deletion did not inhibit colony formation in any cell line assessed. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that reduced BIN1 expression contributes to the malignant phenotype of childhood NB. As we reported previously, BIN1 may function to circumvent MycN-mediated apoptosis in NBs with MYCN amplification.",M1
12702577,"PPM1D is a potential target for 17q gain in neuroblastoma.Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) show complex patterns of genetic abnormalities, which may include amplification of the MYCN gene, deletion of 1p, or a gain of DNA at 17q, the last being the most frequent observation in NB tumors. However, the specific genes and the molecular mechanisms responsible for development and progression of NB remain poorly understood. We investigated aberrations of DNA copy number in 25 NB cell lines using comparative genomic hybridization and identified a minimal common region of gain at 17q23. Although gain of distal 17q is the most powerful genetic predictor of adverse outcome currently available for patients with NB, thus far, no potential target genes have been reported for that region. Therefore, we defined the 17q23 amplicon in detail and determined expression levels of 15 genes located within the smallest region of overlap observed among our NB cell lines to identify the most likely target gene(s). Among them, seven (CLTC, VMP1, delta-tubulin, RPS6KB1, FLJ22087, APPBP2, and PPM1D) were consistently overexpressed through increases in regional copy number. Analysis of expression levels of those seven genes in 32 primary NB tumors revealed a significant correlation between higher expression and poorer clinical outcome only with respect to PPM1D. Moreover, down-regulation of PPM1D by transfection of an antisense oligonucleotide suppressed the growth of NB cell lines to a remarkable degree, at least partly by participating in a process leading to apoptotic cell death. Taken together, our results indicate that PPM1D is the most likely target of the 17q23 gain/amplification in NB tumors and may have an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.",M1
12680183,"Aberrant bcl-2 and bax protein expression related to chemotherapy response in neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma (NB) is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system which develops in young children. It derives from cells of the embryonal neural crest that form many different tissues, including the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic ganglia. Survival rates for patients with neuroblastoma have remained unchanged despite intensive efforts to develop more effective treatment strategies. The intrinsic resistance of many tumor types to antineoplastic therapies and the appearance of resistant cell populations upon relapse of an originally responsive tumor represent major impediments to successful treatment. The possibility exists that these neoplasms, particularly those that have become refractory to chemotherapeutic drugs, may occur in part because of failed apoptosis. In this study we investigated the immunocytochemical expression, before and after a trial of chemotherapy of the bcl-2 and bax proteins in 15 cases of NB, including 8 stroma-poor and 7 stroma-rich <e>NBs</e>. Patients with strong expression of bcl-2 before the treatment had shorter survival than those with weak or moderate expression of the protein (p = 0.004). Moreover, bcl-2 protein expression was correlated to the stroma-poor histotype only after the treatment (p = 0.031). An association between bax protein expression before treatment and longer survival (p = 0.014) was also found. We conclude that bcl-2 and bax expression, before the treatment, could be of prognostic value in neuroblastomas.",M1
12647219,"Expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein increases during the differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells.The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, whose fusion with retinoic acid receptor alpha is responsible for the tumorigenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, acts as a tumor suppressor in various types of human cancers. We analyzed the expression patterns of PML, in both primary neuroblastic tumors ( n=20) and two human neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines, SMS-KCNR (KCNR) and SH-SY5Y (SY5Y). The expression of PML, revealed as speckled or microgranular staining in the nuclei, was positively correlated with the differentiation status of NB cells in vivo, and was upregulated during the differentiation of KCNR and SY5Y cells following retinoic acid treatment. Screening of PML expression in human brain and sympathetic ganglia showed restricted expression of PML in mature neurons and glial cells, a result that was consistent with that in differentiated NB tumors. All these findings strongly suggest that increased PML expression is associated with growth inhibition and differentiation of human NB cells, and that it is of critical significance in the biology of <e>NBs</e> and in human nervous system development.",M1
12538451,"Deletions in chromosome arms 3p and 11q are new prognostic markers in localized and 4s neuroblastoma.PURPOSE: To find new nonrandom chromosomal changes in neuroblastoma (NB) with a potential to forecast the patient's outcome, alterations in chromosome arms 3p and 11q were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Frequency and prognostic potential of 3p and 11q alterations in 144 <e>NBs</e> were analyzed using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with DNA probes for 3p26 and 11q23. Aberrations were defined as deletion (monosomy of a specific region) or imbalance (at least two intact and additional 3p26- or 11q23-deleted chromosomes). RESULTS: Forty-two of 144 cases (29%) displayed 11q alterations (21% deletions, 8% imbalances). Most aberrations were associated with stage 4 disease (28 of 59, 47%) but were also present in localized and 4s tumors (14 of 85, 16%; P = 0.007). Patients with 11q deletion/imbalance were significantly older at diagnosis (P &lt; 0.001). Changes in 3p were detected in 26 of 144 (18%) samples (15% deletions, 3% imbalances). These alterations were also associated with stage 4 [20 of 59 (34%) versus 6 of 85 (7%) in stages 1-3 and 4s, P = 0.007], and the median age was increased (P &lt; 0.001). Aberrations in both chromosomes were highly associated with each other (P &lt; 0.001). MYCN amplification (MNA) was detected in 10% and 12% of tumors with 11q and 3p alterations, and changes in 1p36 occurred in 13% and 26% of the 3p- and 11q-aberrant tumors. MYCN amplification and 11q deletion/imbalance tended to show an inverse correlation (P = 0.07) as well as 1p and 3p deletion/imbalance (P = 0.07). Patients with 3p and 11q abnormalities in localized/4s tumors showed an inferior outcome compared with those without these alterations (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0027, respectively), in particular in MYCN single copy tumors (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Alterations in 3p and 11q are frequent nonrandom aberrations in NB and define a new high-risk subgroup in MYCN single copy stage 1-3 and 4s disease.",M1
12508241,"Hypermethylation-mediated regulation of CD44 gene expression in human neuroblastoma.The CD44 adhesion receptor is silenced in highly malignant neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) with MYCN amplification. Because its functional expression is associated with decreased tumorigenic properties, CD44 behaves as a tumor suppressor gene in NB and other cancers. Given that the precise mechanisms responsible for CD44 silencing are not elucidated, we investigated whether CD44 expression could be regulated by DNA hypermethylation. The methylation status of CD44 gene promoter and exon 1 regions was analyzed in 12 NB cell lines and 21 clinical samples after bisulfite genomic modification, followed by PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and genomic sequencing. The results showed that almost all CD44-negative cell lines displayed hypermethylation in both regions, whereas all CD44-expressing cell lines were unmethylated. These observations correlated with the ability to restore CD44 mRNA and protein expression by treatment of CD44-negative cells with the 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine demethylating agent. In contrast, no CD44 gene hypermethylation could be detected in 21 NB clinical samples of different stages, irrespective of CD44 expression. Although our results suggest that aberrant methylation of promoter and exon 1 regions is involved in CD44 silencing in NB cell lines, they also indicate that methylation of unidentified regulatory sequences or methylation-independent mechanisms also control the expression of CD44 in primary NB tumors and cell lines. We therefore conclude that CD44 silencing is controlled by complex and tumor cell-specific processes, including gene hypermethylation. Further investigation of other mechanisms and genes involved in CD44 regulation will be needed before demethylation-mediated reactivation of the CD44 gene can be considered as therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma and perhaps other related cancers.",M1
12506025,"The PML gene is not involved in the regulation of MHC class I expression in human cell lines.The promyelocytic leukemia gene, PML, is a growth and transformation suppressor. An additional role for PML as a regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation has been proposed in a murine model, which would account for evasion from host immunity of tumors bearing malfunctioning PML, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we investigated a possible role of PML for the control MHC class I expression in human cells. PML function was perturbed in human cell lines either by PML/RAR alpha transfection or by PML- specific RNA interference. Impairment of wild-type PML function was proved by a microspeckled disassembly of nuclear bodies (<e>NBs</e>), where the protein is normally localized, or by their complete disappearance. However, no MHC class I down-regulation was observed in both instances. We next constructed a PML mutant, PML mut ex3, that is a human homolog of the murine PML mutant, truncated in exon 3, that was shown to down-regulate murine MHC class I. PML mut ex3 transfected in human cell lines exerted a dominant-negative effect since no PML molecules were detected in NBs but, instead, in perinuclear and cytoplasmic larger dot-like structures. Nevertheless, no down-regulation of MHC class I expression was evident. Moreover, neither transfection with PML mut ex3 nor PML-specific RNA interference affected the ability of gamma-interferon to up-regulate MHC class I expression. We conclude that, in human cell lines, PML is not involved directly in the regulation of MHC class I expression.",M1
12438240,"No evidence for the presence of an imprinted neuroblastoma suppressor gene within chromosome sub-band 1p36.3.Deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 1 occurs in 35% of primary neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>). These deletions tend to be large and extend to the telomere, but a common region within sub-band 1p36.3 is consistently lost. Despite intensive investigation, no candidate tumor suppressor gene within this region has been shown to undergo tumor-specific mutation consistent with biallelic inactivation. In addition, initial studies demonstrated preferential loss of the maternally inherited 1p homologue in NBs with 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH) without MYCN amplification. This has led to the widely accepted hypothesis that a genomically imprinted NB suppressor gene is the target of 1p deletion in this subset. To test this hypothesis we have studied 293 primary NBs for LOH within 1p36.3 and determined the parental origin of the deleted 1p homologue. LOH within 1p36.3 was demonstrated in 55 NBs (19%). Of these, 29 occurred in tumors without MYCN amplification: 13 had deletion of the maternally inherited 1p, whereas 16 had deletion of the paternally inherited 1p (P = 0.58). These data strongly refute a parent-of-origin effect for 1p deletions in NB and exclude the existence of an imprinted NB suppressor locus in this region.",M1
12415344,"Neonatal tumours: a single-centre experience.Solid tumours are uncommon in the neonatal period. We present our experience of managing neonatal tumours in a tertiary reference centre to study the incidence, pathology and types, efficacy of treatment, and impact of antenatal diagnosis on the management in our practice in a retrospective study of case-notes and pathology reports. Eighty-three neonates with solid tumours were seen over a 45-year period (1955-1999); 62 (74%) presented at birth. Only 11 were diagnosed antenatally. Teratomas were the commonest type (n = 33, 40%) followed by neuroblastomas (NB) (14), renal (13), soft-tissue (10), hepatic (4), and miscellaneous tumours (2). Twenty-three (28%) were malignant, 50% of these being <e>NBs</e>. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. Chemotherapy has also become safer. Therapeutic complications were responsible for 50% of deaths before 1986; from 1986 onwards, there has been no therapy-related mortality. Only one-third of the recent cases were diagnosed antenatally. Counseling the family and in-utero transfer is the best option. In our limited series, there was no significant difference in management and outcome in the antenatally-diagnosed cases. The small numbers of neonatal tumours seen by individual centres underline the need for an international effort to optimise therapy and improve understanding of these tumours.",M1
11912158,"Expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA down-regulates expression and function of angiogenic stimulators in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis and depends on the production of angiogenic factors. Mechanisms regulating the expression of angiogenic factors in tumor cells are largely unknown. High expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA in neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) is associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas TrkB is mainly expressed on aggressive, MYCN-amplified NBs. To investigate the biological effects of TrkA and TrkB expression on angiogenesis in NB, we examined the expression of angiogenic factors in the human NB cell line SY5Y and its TrkA and TrkB transfectants. In comparison with parental SY5Y cells, mRNA and protein levels of the examined angiogenic factors were significantly reduced in SY5Y-TrkA cells, whereas SY5Y-TrkB cells did not demonstrate a significant change. Conditioned medium of TrkB transfectants and parental SY5Y cells induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, but this effect was completely absent in SY5Y-TrkA cells. TrkA expression also resulted in severely impaired tumorigenicity in a mouse xenograft model and was associated with reduced angiogenic factor expression and vascularization of tumors, as determined by immunohistochemistry and an in vivo Matrigel assay. TrkA expression inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in SY5Y NB cells by down-regulation of angiogenic factors, whereas expression of TrkB does not down-regulate the production of these angiogenic factors. The biologically different behavior of TrkA- and TrkB-expressing NBs may be explained in part by their effects on angiogenesis.",M1
11826111,"N-myc promotes survival and induces S-phase entry of postmitotic sympathetic neurons.In most postmitotic neurons, expression or activation of proteins that stimulate cell cycle progression or DNA replication results in apoptosis. One potential exception to this generalization is neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor derived from the sympathoadrenal lineage. <e>NBs</e> often express high levels of N-myc, a proto-oncogene that can potently activate key components of the cell cycle machinery. Here, we show that in postmitotic sympathetic neurons, N-myc can induce S-phase entry while protecting neurons from death caused by aberrant cell cycle reentry. Specifically, these experiments demonstrate that expression of N-myc at levels similar to those in NBs caused sympathetic neurons to reenter S-phase, as monitored by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and rescued them from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of their obligate survival factor, nerve growth factor. The N-myc-induced cell cycle entry, but not enhanced survival, was inhibited by coexpression of a constitutively hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, suggesting that these two effects of N-myc are mediated by separate pathways. In contrast, N-myc did not cause S-phase entry in postmitotic cortical neurons. Thus, N-myc both selectively causes sympathetic neurons to reenter the cell cycle and protects them from apoptosis, potentially contributing to their transformation to NBs.",M1
11745206,"Histopathology (International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification) and MYCN status in patients with peripheral neuroblastic tumors: a report from the Children's Cancer Group.BACKGROUND: The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (International Classification), which was established in 1999, is significant prognostically and is relevant biologically for the evaluation and analysis of patients with neuroblastic tumors (NTs). MYCN amplification is a known molecular marker for aggressive progression of NTs. These have been used together as important prognostic factors to define risk groups for patient stratification and protocol assignment. METHODS: A total of 628 NTs (535 neuroblastomas [<e>NBs</e>]); 21 ganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed [GNBi]; 9 ganglioneuromas [GN]; and 63 ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular [GNBn]) from the Children's Cancer Group studies were evaluated histologically (favorable histology [FH] tumors vs. unfavorable histology [UH] tumors) according to the International Classification and were tested molecularly for MYCN status (amplified vs. nonamplified). Four tumor subsets (FH-nonamplified, FH-amplified, UH-nonamplified, and UH-amplified) were defined by histopathology and MYCN status, and their prognostic effects were analyzed. Detailed analysis between morphologic indicators (grade of neuroblastic differentiation and mitosis-karyorrhexis index [MKI]) and MYCN status was done by using tumors in the NB category. RESULTS: There were 339 FH-nonamplified tumors (5-year event free survival [EFS], 92.1%); 8 FH-amplified tumors (EFS, 37.5%); 172 UH-nonamplified tumors (EFS, 40.9%); and 109 UH-amplified tumors (EFS, 15.0%). The prognostic effects on patients with tumors in the four subsets were independent from the factors of patient age and disease stage (P &lt; 0.0001). MYCN amplification was seen almost exclusively in tumors of the NB category, and no patients with tumors in either the GNBi category or in the GN category and only two patients with tumors in the GNBn category had amplified MYCN. Among the patients with tumors in the NB category, patients with FH-nonamplified tumors (309 patients) had an excellent prognosis, and patients with UH-amplified tumors (107 patients) had the poorest clinical outcome in any age group. The prognosis for children with UH-nonamplified tumors (111 patients) was poor when they were diagnosed at age &gt; 1.5 years. It was also noted that patients with UH-amplified tumors (median age, 2.14 years) were diagnosed at a significantly younger age compared with the patients with UH-nonamplified tumors (median age, 3.55 years). Histologically, MYCN-amplified tumors lacked neuroblastic differentiation regardless of the age of patients. MYCN amplification also was linked generally to increased mitotic and karyorrhectic activities. However, MKI classes in patients with MYCN-amplified tumors varied significantly, depending on the age at diagnosis, and younger patients had higher MKI classes. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of histopathologic evaluation and MYCN status distinguishes four clinical and biologic tumor subsets in patients with NTs. MYCN amplification seems to be the powerful driving force for preventing cellular differentiation regardless of patient age and for increasing mitotic and karyorrhectic activities in an age dependent manner.",M1
11691808,"A midkine promoter-based conditionally replicative adenovirus for treatment of pediatric solid tumors and bone marrow tumor purging.The treatment of advanced neuroblastoma (NB) or Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is one of the major challenges in pediatric oncology. Both malignancies are refractory to conventional therapies and have an extremely poor prognosis. High-dose myeloablative radiochemotherapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue is one of the most aggressive treatments attempted for these diseases but is often undermined by residual tumor cells contaminating the graft. Thus, in this approach, purging of tumor cells from the graft is key to the prevention of relapse after transplantation. We investigated a novel approach to eliminate tumor cells from the bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell graft without causing stem cell damage through the use of a conditionally replicative adenovirus (Ad). ES and NB are sensitive to Ad infection, and advanced <e>NBs</e> express a high level of the growth/differentiation factor midkine (MK). We confirmed in this study that ES cell lines (SK-ES-1 and RD-ES) are also sensitive to Ad infection and express high levels of MK. In contrast, CD34+ stem cells are refractory to Ad infection and express very little MK. A conditionally replicative Ad in which the expression of E1 is controlled by the MK promoter achieved good levels of viral replication in NB or ES and induced remarkable tumor cell killing. On the other hand, this virus caused no damage to CD34+ cells even after 3 h of infection at a dose of 1000 multiplicity of infection. We concluded that application of this replication-competent Ad to hematopoietic grafts could be a simple but effective procedure to achieve complete tumor cell purging.",M1
11550167,"GD2 synthase: a new molecular marker for detecting neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) almost ubiquitously express the ganglioside GD2. GD2 synthesis is dependent on the key enzyme GD2 synthase. Thus, GD2 synthase transcript may prove to be a potential molecular marker of NB. METHODS: Seventy-seven NB tumor tissues of all stages, 5 NB cell lines, and 26 normal bone marrows (BMs) and peripheral blood (PBL) samples, as well as 26 non-NB remission-BMs were analyzed for the expression of GD2 synthase by a highly sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chemiluminescence detection. One hundred fifty-two NB BMs were tested and comparisons were made among three independent detection techniques, namely GD2 synthase RT-PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), and histology (HIST). RESULTS: GD2 synthase transcript was present in 5 of 5 cell lines and in 77 of 77 tumors tested. Among 116 marrows that were positive by at least 1 of the 3 methods, 78% were detectable by GD2 synthase, 68% by IF, and 46% by HIST. Seventy-six percent of positive BMs that were obtained during treatment and follow-up had GD2 synthase expression, whereas only 29% were HIST positive. Correlation between RT-PCR and IF was high (P = 0.001), and positivity by 3 out of 3 methods was strongly correlated with poor survival (P &lt; 0.01). Of note, marrows tested at the time of chemotherapy were positive by at least 2 out of 3 methods and were associated with adverse outcome (P = 0.01). Serial samples (n = 28) in 5 patients demonstrated close agreement between RT-PCR and patient disease status. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found that molecular detection of GD2 synthase transcript in NB BMs may have potential value in detecting rare tumor cells.",M1
11526494,"Genomic structure and mutational analysis of the human KIF1B gene which is homozygously deleted in neuroblastoma at chromosome 1p36.2.In order to clone candidate tumor suppressor genes whose loss contributes to the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB), we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using a high-density sequence tagged site-content map within a commonly deleted region (chromosome band 1p36) in 24 NB cell lines. We found a approximately 480 kb homozygously deleted region at chromosome band 1p36.2 in one of the 24 NB cell lines, NB-1, and cloned the human homologue (KIF1B-beta) of the mouseKif1B-beta gene in this region. The KIF1B-beta gene had at least 47 exons, all of which had a classic exon-intron boundary structure. Mouse Kif1B is a microtubule-based putative anterograde motor protein for the transport of mitochondria in neural cells. We performed mutational analysis of the KIF1B-beta gene in 23 cell lines using 46 sets of primers and also an allelic imbalance (AI) analysis of KIF1B-beta in 50 fresh NB samples. A missense mutation at codon 1554, GTG (Gly) to ATG (Met), silent mutations at codon 409 (ACG to ACA) and codon 1721 (ACC to ACT), and polymorphisms at codon 170, GAT (Asp) to GAA (Glu), and at codon 1087, TAT (Tyr), to TGT (Cys), were all identified, although their functional significances remain to be determined. The AI for KIF1B-beta was slightly higher (38%) than those for the other two markers (D1S244, D1S1350) (35 and 32%) within the commonly deleted region (1p36). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the KIF1B-beta gene revealed obvious expression in all NB cell lines except NB-1, although decreased expression of the KIF1B-beta gene was found in a subset of early- and advanced-stage <e>NBs</e>. These results suggest that the KIF1B-beta gene may not be a candidate for tumor suppressor gene of NB.",M1
11464911,"Association among EPHB2, TrkA, and MYCN expression in low-stage neuroblastomas.BACKGROUND: The EPH family is the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, consisting of EPHA and EPHB subgroups. Ligands of EPH family receptors are called ephrins, which include ephrin-A and ephrin-B subgroups. We recently found that transcripts encoding the EPHB subgroup (EPHB) and the ephrin-B subgroup (EFNB) were expressed together in neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines. PROCEDURE: In this study, we examined the expression of EPHB and EFNB transcripts in 24 NB specimens representing all clinical stages. We found that several EPHB and EFNB transcripts were expressed together in all <e>NBs</e> examined. RESULTS: Among the transcripts examined, EPHB6 expression was most significantly associated with low stage tumors (stages 1, 2, and 4S; P = 0.0048). TrkA expression was significantly correlated with EPHB6, EFNB2, and EFNB3 expression (P &lt; 0.01 in each case). Taken together, these data indicate that the expression of EPHB6, EFNB2, and EFNB3 may serve as prognostic indicators of favorable NBs. In the low-stage NBs without MYCN amplification, EPHB2 expression was correlated both with MYCN expression and with TrkA expression (P &lt; 0.01 in each case). Moreover, MYCN expression was correlated with TrkA expression (P &lt; 0.01) in the low-stage NBs. CONCLUSIONS: This observation points to the possibility that MYCN expression might contribute to favorable outcome of low-stage NBs.",M1
11464903,"Genomic and allelic expression status of the p73 gene in human neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURE: The p53 gene homologue, p73, is located on the 1p36-3 locus, which is frequently deleted in human neuroblastoma (NB). A survey of 61 NB showed that among 33% of informative cases, p73 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurred in 7 of 20 (35%). RESULTS: LOH pattern of vicinal markers suggested that the p73 gene could not be considered as the candidate NB suppressor gene. Moreover, comparative measurements of allelic expression in tumors and corresponding patient lymphocytes indicate that pure biallelism is much more frequent in lymphocytes than in tumors (71% vs 30%, P= 0.05), which suggests that disequilibrated allelic expression is associated with NB disease. CONCLUSION: Therefore, in the p73 LOH <e>NBs</e>, the p73 gene could be altered in the maintained allele not by mutations [Ishimiya et al.: Med Pediatr Oncol, this issue], but rather by an abnormal transcription.",M1
11464875,"Neuroblastoma cells provoke Schwann cell proliferation in vitro.BACKGROUND: A subset of human neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) has the capacity to mature completely, imitating sympathetic ganglia. Previously, we showed that the neuronal population in spontaneously maturing NBs usually has a near-triploid DNA content without 1p deletions, and we concluded that the constantly diploid Schwann cells (SCs) do not belong to the neoplastic component of these tumours. We therefore hypothesised that NB cells are able to stimulate SC proliferation, and that SCs trigger NB differentiation. PROCEDURE: We performed in vitro experiments to test this model and to test whether SCs can also influence the growth of aggressive NBs. Human SCs were co-cultivated with NB tumours and cell lines, and were harvested after defined time intervals. Proliferative activity of the SCs and the NB cells was determined by visualisation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation or Ki-67 staining. Neurite outgrowth and neurofilament (NF) expression were analysed immunocytochemically and apoptotic rate was determined by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-X fluorescein nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: Human NB tumours or cell lines unequivocally increased the proliferation of SCs in vitro. In cocultivated NB cells, the proliferative activity was not altered in the first days of cocultivation, although neurite outgrowth and NF expression were enhanced. However, after 10 days, the mitotic rate of neuroblastic cells decreased and the apoptotic rate showed a marked increase. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the cocultivation experiments provide an experimental hint that the in vivo growth of SCs in NBs is caused by the neoplastic neuroblasts, and they also indicate that cells from peripheral nerves can influence the growth of aggressive NB cells if cocultivated.",M1
11433523,"Homozygous deletion in a neuroblastoma cell line defined by a high-density STS map spanning human chromosome band 1p36.Recent molecular studies have shown a relatively high rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in neuroblastoma (NB) as well as other types of tumors in human chromosome band 1p36. To identify candidate tumor suppressor genes in NB, we searched for homozygous deletions in NB cell lines with PCR according to a high-density sequence tagged site (STS)-content map spanning 1p35-36. Among 25 NB cell lines examined, only one cell line, NB-1, showed no signal with 27 STSs in a 480 kb region in 1p36.2. The sequence analysis has revealed that the defective region included seven known genes (E4, KIF1B, SCYA5, PGD, Cortistatin, DFF45, and PEX14), nine expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and two microsatellite markers. These genes are related to apoptosis, an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a neuronal microtubule-associated motor molecule, and components of a common translocation machinery. The region between the DFF45 and KIF1B genes was defined as homozygous deletion by Southern blotting. The search in LOH regions with high-density STSs may be useful for the isolation and identification of tumor suppressor genes in other tumors as well as <e>NBs</e>.",M1

The Japanese Infantile Neuroblastoma Cooperative Study.Current study shows that about 50% of neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) detected through mass screening had factor(s) indicating an unfavorable biological nature and that early intervention after the screening might improve clinical outcome of the patients. On the other hand, favorable properties were detected in the remaining half of the mass-screening NBs. Some of them might have the ability to regress spontaneously. Therapeutic modality should be determined according to their biological nature. Further investigation for their biologic properties is necessary to evaluate the benefits of the mass screening.",M1
11107107,"Deletion mapping of 14q32 in human neuroblastoma defines an 1,100-kb region of common allelic loss.BACKGROUND: We analyzed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 54 primary neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) using 12 microsatellite markers on 14q32, and found that 31% (17/54) NBs showed LOH. PROCEDURE: The smallest region of overlap (SRO) was identified between D14S62 and D14S987. RESULTS: There was no statistical correlation between LOH and any clinicopathologic features, including age, stage, amplification of MYCN, and ploidy. A sequence-ready bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig was constructed, and the minimum tiling path of six BACs covered the SRO; the physical length of this region was no larger than 1,000 kb. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the existence of a putative tumor-related gene on 14q32 for the tumorigenesis of NB.",M1
10910669,"[Histopathologic differentiation of tumors derived from neuroblastic cells in children depending on age]The histopathology of 224 tumours of neuroblastic origin was analysed in relation to the age of patients. Maturing neuroblastomas (<e>NBS</e>) dominated in infants, where as in the most numerous group of children 1-5 years of age, prevalence of neuroblastomas without any signs of maturation was noted. In children over 5 years of age a high incidence of tumours with evident maturation was noted (ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas). The prevalence of maturing neuroblastomas in infants correlate well with an advantageous clinical course of neuroblastomas at this age.",M1
10843282,"Clinicopathologic study of mass-screened neuroblastoma with special emphasis on untreated observed cases: a possible histologic clue to tumor regression.Spontaneous regression and maturation of neuroblastoma (NB) are well documented and occur frequently in infants, including those detected by mass screening. To seek histologic clues for regression/maturation in mass-screened NB, clinicopathologic features of 12 tumors that were resected after 2 to 18 months of untreated observation were reviewed. Unobserved screened and age-matched unscreened patients were also studied. To evaluate the possible important role of apoptosis, apoptotic cells were detected by in situ deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nick end labeling and immunohistochemical stain for activated caspase-3. Nests with a varying degree of reduced cellularity ( less cellular  and  hypocellular  nests) were common in patients younger than 18 months of age, and were rare in older patients. Two characteristic cells, which have not been focused previously, were frequent, especially in the hypocellular nests. One showed amorphic eosinophilic cytoplasm with pyknotic nuclei and the other contained plump cytoplasm with well-maintained nuclei. These cells were also observed in 89% of the unobserved screened <e>NBs</e> and 79% of the age-matched unscreened patients with good outcome, whereas they could not be confirmed in any of the age-matched unscreened NBs with poor outcome. The amorphic and plump cells were negative for activated caspase-3 and in situ DNA nick end labeling. From these results, the authors hypothesize that these cells most likely represent a degenerative process, in either a state before the activation of caspase-3 or a caspase-independent form of cell death. The presence of less cellular and hypocellular nests with amorphic/plump cells may serve as one of the important clues in predicting tumor prognosis.",M1
10719054,"The p73 gene is less involved in the development but involved in the progression of neuroblastoma.We performed expression, mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of the p73 gene in neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers which can detect both the p73alpha and p73beta transcripts was performed on 30 fresh NBs and 22 NB cell lines. Aberrant expression of the p73 gene was found in 4 (25%) of 16 primary tumors found by mass screening and in 10 (71.4%) of 14 primary tumors found clinically. The rates of expression in these two types of tumors were significantly different (p=0.026, Fisher's exact test). The incidence of aberrant expression of the p73 gene was significantly higher in stage IV patients than in stages I, II, III plus IVS patients (p=0.0236, Fisher's exact test). No homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p73 gene were found in any samples examined. In addition to the polymorphism in exon 2, a silent mutation (codon 336 GCC/GCT) was found in one primary tumor. LOH of the p73 gene was detected in 5 (15%) of 33 primary NBs using PCR-LOH analysis. FISH analysis showed that all 17 NB cell lines used in this study revealed allelic loss of the p73 gene, while most of them expressed the p73 gene. These results suggest that the p73 gene is not monoallelically expressed in NB. We conclude that the p73 gene is less involved in the development but involved in the progression of neuroblastoma.",M1
10556754,"Metastatic neuroblastoma with ganglioneuromatous differentiation and mandibular involvement.Neuroblastic tumors comprise neuroblastoma (NB), ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma (GN). <e>NBs</e> have shown remarkable differentiation capabilities, which include spontaneous regression.

10374361,"Fifteen years' review of advanced childhood neuroblastoma from a single institution in Hong Kong.OBJECTIVE: To assess the progress in the treatment of advanced childhood neuroblastoma. METHODS: From 1981 to 1996, there were 32 children with neuroblastoma (NB) diagnosed, staged and treated in our institution. There were 4 patients with stage II NB (12%), 5 stage III (16%), 21 stage IV (66%) and 2 stage IV s (6%). The <e>NBs</e> were excised if CT scan indicated that the tumors were operable. For advanced NB, stages III and IV, multiple drug chemotherapy was started first and operability was assessed with serial CT scan examinations. Once the X-ray imaging indicated the tumors were operable, surgical interventions were done. The medical records of the advanced NB were reviewed. RESULTS: In the initial period of the study, 9 patients were treated using the VAC protocol [vincristine (vcr), adriamycin (adria) and cyclophosphamide (cyc)]. No patient was convertible to operable and all died with a mean survival of 10 months. OPEC [vcr, cyc, VM26, cisplatin (cis)], Rapid COJEC (carboplatin, VP16, vcr, cis and cyc) and more recently N6 protocol (cyc, adria, vcr, VP16, cis) was used for 17 patients. 80% of them were converted to operable. In 4 patients, surgical specimens showed only necrotic tissue without viable tumor tissue and 6 (35%) tumors were converted to ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma. Although 2 (12%) patients died of fungal septicemia and 1 (6%) developed Fanconi's syndrome after chemotherapy, the mean survival period increased to 27 months. In the 10 survivors (60%), 4 had megatherapy with melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation and 2 were waiting for transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high percentage of advanced NB on presentation in Hong Kong. With more potent multiple drug chemotherapy for advanced stage NB there are (1) improvement in the survival of these patients, (2) opportunities for more operations for tumor excision and (3) opportunities for autologous PBSC transplantation for better tumor eradication.",M1
10091748,"The RNA component of telomerase as a marker of biologic potential and clinical outcome in childhood neuroblastic tumors.BACKGROUND: Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme associated with cellular immortality that may be useful in determining the biologic potential of a tumor. Neuroblastoma (NB), ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), and ganglioneuroma (GN) are neuroblastic tumors (NTs) that exhibit a spectrum of histologic features and are often associated with unpredictable behavior and clinical outcome. METHODS: The authors investigated the expression of the RNA component of human telomerase (hTR) by in situ hybridization in 32 cases of NTs (including 24 <e>NBs</e>, 4 GNBs, and 4 GNs), using [35S]-UTP labeled single stranded sense and antisense RNA probes. Eight NBs were early stage, 12 NBs were advanced stage, and 4 NBs were Stage IVS, a widely metastatic variant associated with an excellent clinical prognosis. Four NBs had N-myc amplification. In addition, the authors compared a proliferation marker, MIB-1, with hTR expression in a subset of tumors. RESULTS: Thirty of 32 NTs expressed hTR, with expression varying from weak (1+) to intense (4+). Most advanced stage NBs (9 of 12) and only 2 of 8 early stage NBs had moderate to intense (2 to 4-) expression of hTR. The remaining early stage tumors (6 of 8) and 3 of 12 advanced stage NBs had absent or weak expression of hTR (0 to 1+). There was no disease progression in any of the patients with absent or weak expression of hTR. In contrast, 8 tumors (from 7 patients) with moderate to intense expression of hTR in the tumor sections had adverse clinical outcomes, including recurrence, persistent disease, or death. hTR expression in all the Stage IVS tumors was weak, despite the fact that the patients had widely metastatic disease at presentation. The mean hTR score of 3.1 for NBs associated with an adverse outcome (n = 8) was significantly different from the mean hTR score of 1.3 for NBs associated with a favorable outcome (n = 16), P &lt; 0.001. hTR expression in the GNB/GNs was limited to the ganglion cells only; Schwann cells were negative for hTR expression. Stage IVS tumors, which are associated with an excellent outcome, had high MIB-1 but weak hTR expression, indicating that the latter may be a better discriminator of true biologic potential and that hTR levels do not always correlate with cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased hTR expression may reflect the potential for aggressive behavior within the spectrum of NTs; conversely, down-regulation of hTR may be useful in identifying subsets with limited capacity for progression and a favorable prognosis.",M1

9781958,"Prognostic discrimination among neuroblastomas according to Ha-ras/trk A gene expression: a comparison of the profiles of neuroblastomas detected clinically and those detected through mass screening.BACKGROUND: Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) exhibit a wide variety of clinical behavior. It is important to determine the biology of NB before treatment is instituted. METHODS: One hundred six NBs detected clinically (clinical NBs) were classified according to immunohistochemical expression of the Ha-ras and trk A genes. Association of the two-gene expression with patient outcome was examined retrospectively, and the possibility of prognostic prediction was evaluated. The profile of the expression of the two genes in 85 NBs detected through mass screening (mass NBs) was compared with that in clinical NBs. RESULTS: Ha-rasltrk A expression in clinical NBs was associated with disease free survival, even when the NBs had no amplification of the N-myc gene. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the expression of Ha-rasl/trk A was a significant prognostic factor that was independent of stage, age at diagnosis, and N-myc amplification. Favorable outcomes of patients with advanced NB were distinguished by high Ha-ras and high trk A expression, and unfavorable outcomes were distinguished by low Ha-ras and low trk A expression. A profile of the two genes in mass NBs was different from that in clinical NBs. Greater than 50% of the mass NBs were detected as localized tumors with high Ha-ras and high trk A expression. The mass screening detected NBs with favorable and unfavorable biology. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Ha-ras and trk A is an excellent predictor of both favorable and unfavorable biology in NBs. The information it provides can be important in determining the appropriate therapeutic intervention for each patient.",M1

We also assessed chromosome 1p36 deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase nuclei. 1p-LOH was found in 19 (36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23-50%) NBs. We detected interstitial and large deletion in both localized and disseminated tumours and in one tumour of a patient at stage 4S. Allelic loss was frequently observed in 1p36 and 1p32 regions. In patients older than 1 year of age (53 versus 13%, P &lt; 0.002) we detected significant chromosome 1p deletion and it was associated with MYCN amplification (P = 0.001). Overall survival (OS) analysis showed that 1p-LOH is predictive of a poor outcome (odds ratio 16.5, 95% CI 5.4-50.9%); therefore, 1p-LOH should be regarded as an additional tumour progression marker in neuroblastoma.",M1

Neuroblastoma Study Group of the Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique (SFOP).Neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) were assessed according to INSS recommendations including MIBG scan and extensive bone marrow staging to eliminate metastatic spread. Patients with unresectable tumour received primary chemotherapy including two courses of carboplatin-etoposide (CE) and two of vincristine-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin (CAdO). Post-operative treatment was to be given only in children over 1 year of age at diagnosis who had residual disease or lymph node (LN) involvement. Between 1990 and 1994, 130 consecutive children were registered. In comparison with resectable primaries, these tumours were more commonly abdominal, larger and associated with N-myc amplification (NMA). Complete, very good and partial response (CR, VGPR, PR) to CE were, respectively, 1%, 7% and 44%, overall response rate (RR) to two courses of CE and two courses of CAdO was 71%, and the tumour could be removed in all but four of the children. The toxicity was manageable. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were, respectively, 88% and 78% with a median follow-up of 38 months. In multivariate analysis, only NMA and LN involvement adversely influenced the outcome, particularly NMA. Children with unresectable NBs and no NMA fared as well as children with resectable ones as OS were, respectively, 95% and 99% and EFS 89% and 91%. Our data show encouraging results in localized but unresectable NBs as 90% of children may be considered as definitely cured, especially those without NMA.",M1
9646033,"Neuroendocrine differentiation in Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors revealed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of chromogranin mRNA.Ewing's sarcomas (ESs), primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), and neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>) are closely related neoplasms supposedly derived from the neural crest and belonging to the family of the small blue round cell tumors of infancy and childhood. We investigated the expression of the neuroendocrine and neuroectodermal markers chromogranin A (CgA) and secretogranin II (SgII) in ESs, PNETs, and NBs, both in primitive tumors (five, nine, and four cases, respectively) and in established cell lines (three ES and two PNET cell lines). Different technical approaches, namely immunohistochemistry, Northern blot analysis, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used in parallel. Chromogranin A and secretogranin II production was constantly detectable in NBs by all procedures. CgA mRNA was detectable in most ESs and PNETs only by RT-PCR, whereas SgII mRNA was detectable in some ESs and PNETs by Northern blot analysis and in all tumors by RT-PCR. CgA and SgII proteins were never detectable by immunohistochemistry in ESs and PNETs. We conclude that neuroendocrine differentiation is shared by all three tumor entities, being more overt in NBs and rudimentary in ESs and PNETs; traces of chromogranin mRNA are detectable only by a highly sensitive RT-PCR procedure.",M1

9473262,"Activity of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine in childhood neuroblastoma: lack of relation to tumour differentiation in vivo.Neuroblastoma (NB) tumour cells have a remarkable tendency to differentiate spontaneously or under the influence of certain drugs. It is not clear whether metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake correlates with differentiation of NB cells. In 28 tumours of 26 patients, iodine-123 MIBG uptake in primary <e>NBs</e> was studied in relation to tumour differentiation, tumour size, cell density and degree of necrosis in subsequently resected specimens. Genetic features such as the presence of chromosomal aberrations (1p-deletion and MYCN amplification) and/or P-glycoprotein (mdr-1 gene product) were also evaluated in relation to MIBG uptake. A highly variable and unpredictable intensity of MIBG uptake was observed in primary as well as secondary resected tumours. This intensity did not relate to any of the above-mentioned factors except that there was a trend towards more intense uptake with increasing size of the tumour. We conclude from our observations that, in contrast to commonly held opinion, well-differentiated tumours do not a priori show a lower MIBG uptake in vivo, even when there are a low number of viable cells and a high degree of necrosis. The degree of differentiation or tumour viability and necrosis following longstanding chemotherapeutic treatment cannot be predicted by the MIBG scan findings. The observed MIBG uptake may be importantly influenced by factors other than those associated with cellular differentiation.",M1

9815755,"Molecular detection of GAGE expression in peripheral blood and bone marrow: utility as a tumor marker for neuroblastoma.The GAGE family of tumor-associated antigens is present in a wide spectrum of human tumors but is highly restricted among normal tissues except to the testis. By reverse transcription-PCR, GAGE expression was detected in 55 of 67 neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>; 8 of 12 stage 1, 13 of 13 stage 2, 9 of 12 stage 3, 7 of 12 stage 4S, and 18 of 18 stage 4), 5 of 5 Ewing's and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, and 11 of 11 tumor cell lines (9 NBs, 1 peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, and 1 melanoma). In contrast, 5 of 6 normal tissues (normal testis was positive), 18 of 18 NB-negative bone marrow (BM; 9 normal, 6 non-NB remission, and 3 stage-2 NB), and 9 of 10 NB-negative peripheral blood (PB; 9 normal and 1 stage 2B) were undetectable. In 18 patients with widespread NB under treatment, GAGE expression in paired samples of BM and PB was 89% concordant. Both correlated strongly with disease measured by conventional methods, including marrow histology or immunocytology, bone scan, meta-iodo-benzylguanidine scan, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and urine vanilly-mandelic acid/homovanillic acid. When serial samples from 14 patients with stage 4 NB were studied, BM from 7 of 7 patients at diagnosis and 14 of 14 patients (25 samples) on treatment were positive for GAGE. Thirteen patients were in continual remission off therapy, and their GAGE expression (12 BM and 9 PB) was undetectable at follow-up. When compared to molecular detection of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, GAGE may offer added sensitivity in detecting NB in both BM and PB. The GAGE family of antigens may be potential tumor markers of minimal residual disease.",M1
9102228,"Absence of functional CD44 hyaluronan receptor on human NMYC-amplified neuroblastoma cells.CD44 represents a heterogeneous group of surface glycoproteins, involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. CD44 is the major receptor for hyaluronate (HA), a component of cell matrices, and most of CD44 known functions are attributed to its ability to recognize HA. We have recently shown that although a majority of human neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>), a childhood cancer, express high levels of CD44H, high stages and tumors with amplification of the NMYC proto-oncogene fail to express CD44. Lack of CD44 expression is strongly associated with the presence of NMYC amplification and has been further shown to represent a new feature for predicting risk of disease progression and dissemination. In the present study, we have investigated the role of CD44 expressed by NB cell lines and the possible relationship among the presence of NMYC amplification, functional expression of CD44 receptor, and tumorigenic properties of NB cells. A panel of cell lines with variable NMYC amplification and/or overexpression, as well as clonal and stable NMYC-transfected NB cells, were analyzed for CD44 expression and ability to bind HA. Our results confirmed previous observations that in NB cell lines lack of CD44 is not always related to the presence of NMYC amplification, with a number of cell lines or transfectants with both CD44 expression and NMYC amplification. However, the ability of the CD44 receptor to bind immobilized hyaluronan was restricted to CD44H+ cell lines without NMYC amplification (SH-EP and ACN). The HA-binding function was CD44 dependent and could be specifically blocked by an anti-CD44 antibody. No induction of functional HA binding was obtained with NMYC-amplified cell lines or NMYC transfectants, despite an induced increase of CD44 expression upon differentiation or after tentative activation of the receptor with phorbol esters. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin resulted in decreased HA binding of cells bearing an active CD44 receptor. We conclude that NMYC-amplified NB cell lines either do not express CD44 at all or express a nonfunctional receptor, whereas nonamplified cells constitutively express an active receptor. The lack of functional HA binding in NB cells might be partly due to incomplete N-glycosylation. The involvement of NMYC in the regulation of N-linked glycosylation can be suspected.",M1
9060818,"Immunohistochemical analysis of Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax in tumors of central and peripheral nervous system origin.The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax was examined by immunohistochemical methods in 93 tumors of nervous system origin, including 49 gliomas (30 astrocytomas and 19 glioblastoma multiforme (GMs)), 16 medulloblastomas (MBs), 19 neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>; 9 undifferentiated and 10 differentiated), and 9 miscellaneous neuroectodermal neoplasms. Among the 49 gliomas, immunopositivity (defined as &gt; or = 10%) was observed for Bcl-2 in 45 (92%), Bcl-X in 48 (98%), Mcl-1 in 49 (100%), and Bax in 48 (98%) of 49 specimens. In 11 (37%) of 30 astrocytomas (WHO grades I to III), the tumor specimens were composed predominantly of malignant cells with strong-intensity Bcl-2 immunostaining, whereas none of the 19 GMs (WHO grade IV) exhibited strong-intensity Bcl-2 immunoreactivity (P = 0.001). Similarly, Mcl-1 immunointensity was strong in 15 (50%) of 30 astrocytomas, compared with only 2 (11%) of 19 GMs (P = 0.005). The percentage of Mcl-1-immunopositive tumor cells was also higher in astrocytomas than GMs (P &lt; 0.002). Thus, contrary to a priori expectations, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 was significantly higher in astrocytomas than in GMs. Of the 16 MBs, immunopositivity was found for Bcl-2 in 4 (25%), Bcl-X in 9 (56%), Mcl-1 in 8 (50%), and Bax in 16 (100%) of the cases. The intensity of immunostaining was strong for Bcl-2 in only 1 (6%) specimen, for Bcl-X in 3 (19%), and for Mcl-1 in 2 (12.5%), in contrast to Bax immunostaining, which was strong in 12 (75%) tumors. Significantly higher percentages of Bax-immunopositive tumor cells were also found in MBs, compared with Bcl-2, Bcl-X, and Mcl-1 (P &lt; 0.0001). All 19 NBs were immunopositive for Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax. Higher percentages of Bcl-X- and Mcl-1-immunopositive tumor cells were observed in well differentiated tumors (P = 0.04 and 0.004, respectively). The intensity of Mcl-1 immunostaining was also generally higher in differentiated than undifferentiated NBs (strong immunointensity in 7 of 10 versus 0 of 9; P = 0.002). Conversely, strong-intensity Bax immunostaining was associated with undifferentiated histology (5 of 9 (56%) versus 1 of 10 (10%); P = 0.03). Taken together, these findings begin to delineate trends in the regulation of the relative levels of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax in gliomas, MBs, NBs, and some of their histological subtypes. The suggestion that expression of some of these Bcl-2 family genes may be differentially regulated in association with tumor progression and differentiation provides insights into the diverse biology and clinical behavior of these tumors of nervous system origin.",M1
9060561,"N-Myc gene amplification is a major prognostic factor in localized neuroblastoma: results of the French NBL 90 study. Neuroblastoma Study Group of the Société Francaise d'Oncologie Pédiatrique.PURPOSE: To assess the relevance of N-Myc gene amplification (NMA) as a prognostic factor in localized neuroblastoma (NB) and to evaluate whether less intensive adjuvant treatment is advisable in infants without NMA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Assessment of <e>NBs</e> included clinical and imaging data to allow tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging, biologic determinations (N-Myc gene analysis), and standard histology and work-up to eliminate metastatic spread (metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] scintigraphy and extensive bone marrow staging). Resectability was defined according to imaging findings. Chemotherapy was indicated in children older than 1 year at diagnosis who had postoperative residual disease or lymph node (LN) involvement, in infants with NMA, or as primary treatment in children with an unresectable NB, including dumbbell tumors. Radiotherapy was recommended in children older than 1 who presented with persistent gross residual disease at the end of therapy. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1994, 316 consecutive children who presented with a localized NB were registered in the NBL 90 study. The median age was 12 months, and 42 patients had dumbbell tumors (13%). NMA was found in 22 of 225 assessable children (10%) and correlated with adverse prognostic indicators such as age older than 1 year, an abdominal primary tumor, a large tumor (T3), and unresectability. Among 186 children who had primary excision, five died of surgery-related complications. Primary chemotherapy was given to 130 patients, which allowed removal of the tumor in all but four. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were, respectively, 91% and 84% with a median follow-up time of 36 months. The outcome of infants and older children was similar (P = .2). EFS of patients with resectable tumors was slightly better than with unresectable primary tumors (EFS, 89% v 78%; P = .02). In dumbbell NBs, neurologic recovery was achieved in 74% of cases that presented with symptoms, and initial laminectomy was avoided in 75% of children. In a univariate analysis, large tumors, high neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, positive LNs, macroscopic residue, and NMA adversely influenced outcome. In the multivariate analysis, NMA was the most powerful unfavorable predictive indicator: OS and EFS rates for these children were 36% and 32%, compared with 98% and 90% in nonamplified tumors (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the overall good prognosis of localized NBs, even when unresectable. NMA is the most relevant adverse prognostic factor in localized NBs, and more intensive treatment should be investigated in these patients. Prospective studies of other biologic factors are warranted to tailor therapy more accurately. The EFS of children who underwent primary surgery was excellent, and further justifies elimination of adjuvant treatment provided they have no NMA. Despite the elimination of postoperative therapy, infants with non-NMA tumors have an excellent outcome, which suggests that initial chemotherapy can be further reduced in case of unresectable NBs.",M1
8912820,"Stage IVS neuroblastoma: a clinical, histological, and biological analysis of 45 cases.This study reports clinicopathologic and biological analysis of 45 stage IVS neuroblastomas (IVS-<e>NBs</e>). All IVS-NB cases had small or undetectable primary tumors associated with disease involving the liver, skin, or bone marrow. Their ages at diagnosis ranged from 1 day to 12 months, with a median age of 4 months. The primary sites were adrenal in 34 cases, retroperitoneum in two, mediastinum in one, and unknown in eight; the liver was involved in 24 of 31 cases, the bone marrow in 11 of 27, and the skin in 4 of 29. According to the histopathological evaluation (Shimada classification), 43 IVS-NB tumors had a favorable histology, and 2 cases showed an unfavorable histology. Three patients died of progressive disease and six of indirect tumor death. Among these three deceased cases with tumor progression, two cases showed unfavorable histology, and one case had amplified N-myc (20 copies). These data suggest that most IVS-NB can be described as a tumor presenting characteristic dissemination pattern in the younger age group, having a favorable histology and showing an excellent outcome of the patients. However, poor prognosis group in stage IVS does exist, and this group could be detected histopathologically and biologically.",M1
8608547,"Modified histologic grading of neuroblastomas by replacement of mitotic rate with mitosis karyorrhexis index. A clinicopathologic study of 223 cases from the Pediatric Oncology Group.BACKGROUND: Histologic grading (HG) of neuroblastomas (NB) of prognostic significance is based on the presence of absence of calcification and low mitotic rate ( &lt; or = 10/10 high power fields). Mitosis karyorrhexis Index (MKI) is the main feature used for prognostic categorization in Shimada classification and can be determined more readily than mitotic rate (MR). The purpose of this study is to test whether MKI can be used instead of MR for histologic grading. METHODS: Low and intermediate MKI were lumped together as low MKI. We replaced MR with the modified MKI categories. Histologic grades for 223 <e>NBs</e> registered with the Pediatric Oncology Group protocols 8104 and 8441, were defined ad follows: HG 1 = calcification + low MKI, HG 2 = calcification or low MKI, HG 3 = high MKI and absence of calcification. Shimada classification was also determined for comparison or modified HGs with favorable histology (FH) and unfavorable histology (UH), HGs were linked with age: low risk (LR) = HG 1 in all age groups + HG 2 in patients age younger than 1 year; high risk (HR) = HG 2 in patients age 1 year of older + HG 3 in all age groups. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in 5-year survival were seen in the NBs of different modified HG (1: 92.7%, 2: 74.9%, and 3: 18.2%) and risk groups (LR 93.0% and HR 47.9%) (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pathologists may readily adapt to the modified HG described here. Advantages of modified HGs include: (1) familiarity and reproducibility of MKI; (2) no need for linkage with age; and (3) a combination of features used in original HGs and Shimada classification.",M1
8589036,"Co-amplification and concomitant high levels of expression of a DEAD box gene with MYCN in human neuroblastoma.MYCN gene amplification is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (NB), the second most common solid pediatric tumor. However, increased MYCN expression seen in tumors that lack MYCN amplification does not correlate with aggressive clinical behavior. Whereas the MYCN gene spans only 7 kb, the MYCN amplicon has been shown to range in size from 350 kb to more than 1 Mb. Given the large size of the amplicon, it is possible that additional genes are co-amplified in <e>NBs</e> whose expression may contribute to the aggressive phenotype associated with MYCN-amplified tumors. We isolated a cDNA clone from a human NB library that is identical to DDXI, a gene recently reported to be preferentially expressed in two retinoblastoma cell lines that also express high levels of MYCN. DDXI belongs to a family of genes that encode DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box proteins, putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alterations of RNA secondary structure. We examined the frequency of DDXI amplification in 15 NB cell lines, 1 neuroepithelioma cell line, and 122 NB tumors by Southern blot analyses, and we found that 7 of 10 MYCN-amplified cell lines and 27 of 40 (68%) MYCN-amplified tumors also harbored multiple copies of the DDXI gene. Amplification of DDXI was associated with high levels of DDXI mRNA expression in the NB cell lines and tumors as examined by Northern analysis. Neither DDXI gene amplification nor enhanced expression was observed in tumors or cell lines that lacked MYCN amplification. Because RNA helicases play important roles in both post-transcriptional and translational gene regulation, high levels of DDXI expression consequent to genomic amplification may contribute to the malignant phenotype of a subset of NBs.",M1
8538026,"[Familial neuroblastoma]Neuroblastoma (NB) is a common malignant solid tumor in childhood, accounting for about 40% of the solid children's neoplasms on the Japanese registry in 1993. It is known that some cases of NB are hereditary, but their incidence is very low. We report two patients with adrenal familial <e>NBs</e> and review the literature on familial NB. Two hit theory was proposed to explain the occurrence of hereditary and non-hereditary NBs. This theory supports the fact that the median age at diagnosis is much younger and the incidence of multiple primaries is higher in the familial NB than in non-familial cases. As therapy for NB improves and more children survive to adulthood, there will be more opportunity to study their offspring.",M1
8529065,"3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase deficiency and resultant high levels of plasma DOPA and dopamine in unfavorable neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma (NB) is a tumor which arises from neural crest cells. In the developing neural crest cells, the induction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase is more delayed than that of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. If NB cells are arrested in an early stage of neural crest development, the induction of DOPA decarboxylase is insufficient and the accumulation and secretion of DOPA can be caused. The biochemically immature phenotype is thought to represent the undifferentiated characteristics of the cells and might correlate with the grade of malignancy. To investigate whether the hypothesis is clinically applicable or not, we have measured plasma DOPA, dopamine and urinary catecholamine metabolites in NB patients. The levels of plasma DOPA, dopamine, urinary homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillactic acid (VLA) were significantly higher in patients with unfavorable <e>NBs</e> and the higher plasma DOPA level was significantly associated with the patients' age (&gt; 1 year old), tumor stage (III, IV) and DNA diploidy. Serial determination of plasma DOPA was a good monitor of the disease course. These results are compatible with the hypothesis on DOPA decarboxylase deficiency and DOPA secretion in undifferentiated, unfavorable NBs. In conclusion, the plasma DOPA can be used to predict patients' prognosis as well as to follow up patients with NB.",M1
7753819,"Wild-type p53 protein undergoes cytoplasmic sequestration in undifferentiated neuroblastomas but not in differentiated tumors.Neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor arising from the sympathetic nervous system, is one of the most common malignancies in childhood. Several recent reports on the p53 genotype found virtually exclusive wild-type status in primary tumors, and it was postulated that p53 plays no role in the development of NB. Here, however, we report that the vast majority of undifferentiated <e>NBs</e> exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53. This inability of p53 to translocate to the nucleus presumably prevents the protein from functioning as a suppressor. Thirty of 31 cases (96%) of undifferentiated NB showed elevated levels of wild-type p53 in the cytoplasm of all tumor cells concomittant with a lack of nuclear staining. p53 immunoprecipitation from tumor tissues showed a 4.5- to 8-fold increase over normal protein levels. All of 10 tumors analyzed harbored wild-type p53 by direct sequencing of full-length cDNA and Southern blot. In addition, no MDM-2 gene amplification was seen in all 11 tumors analyzed. In contrast, no p53 abnormality was detected in 14 differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas and 1 benign ganglioneuroma. We conclude that loss of p53 function seems to play a major role in the tumorigenesis of undifferentiated NB. This tumor might abrogate the transactivating function of p53 by inhibiting its access to the nucleus, rather than by gene mutation. Importantly, our results suggest that (i) this could be a general mechanism for p53 inactivation not limited to breast cancer (where we first described it) and that (ii) it is found in a tumor previously not thought to be affected by p53 alteration.",M1
7850780,"Lack of correlation of N-myc gene amplification with prognosis in localized neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.Multiple copies of N-myc proto-oncogene are only rarely detected in localized neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>), and the prognostic relevance of amplification in this subset of patients is not clear. We analyzed a series of 850 children with NB admitted to a Pediatric Oncology Group NB Biology Study and identified six patients with localized NBs harboring N-myc gene amplification. Three patients whose tumors showed favorable histology by Shimada classification and low-risk histological features according to the Joshi classification have remained disease-free, whereas two of three patients with unfavorable histology tumors have developed recurrent disease. Although earlier studies have indicated that N-myc amplification is associated with diploid DNA content, flow cytometric analysis revealed that only two of the localized tumors contained stem lines with diploid DNA content. Loss of chromosome 1p was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the two tumors examined. N-myc protein was detected by immunohistochemical studies in four of the five NBs analyzed. However, N-myc protein was not visualized in one of the tumors with stroma-rich histology, and Western blot analysis revealed only low levels of N-myc protein expression in another NB with favorable histology. These studies indicate that the presence of N-myc amplification in localized NBs does not necessarily portend an adverse outcome. Furthermore, the biological features of this subset of N-myc-amplified NBs appear to differ from those of more advanced N-myc-amplified tumors.",M1
7837790,"Immunohistochemical analysis of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein in human neuroblastomas. Comparisons with tumor cell differentiation and N-Myc protein.BACKGROUND: The bcl-2 gene encodes a 26-kilodalton integral membrane oncoprotein that is noteworthy for its function as a blocker of programmed cell death, and ability to render cells resistant to killing by chemotherapeutic drugs and x-irradiation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To determine the in vivo patterns of bcl-2 expression in neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>), tumor specimens derived from 17 children with NB or ganglioneuromas were immunohistochemically evaluated using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and antibodies specific for the Bcl-2 and N-Myc proteins, or various markers typically used to assess the differentiation status of these tumors, including neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and the intermediate filament proteins, vimentin, and neurofilament light- and medium-chains. RESULTS: Using two-color immunohistochemical methods, Bcl-2 protein was found exclusively in tumor cells that did not contain N-Myc, an oncoprotein previously associated with poor prognosis in NB. Levels of Bcl-2 immunostaining were heterogeneous in the undifferentiated small, round cells typically seen in tumors with aggressive histology, and ranged from essentially undetectable, to strong in intensity. Somewhat higher levels of Bcl-2 immunostaining were found in the slightly larger, more differentiated neuroblastic cells that had more generous cytoplasm in these neoplasms. In contrast to the heterogeneous levels of Bcl-2 seen in undifferentiated NBs, Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was uniformly present at high levels in tumor cells that were more differentiated and judged to be similar to immature ganglion cells at an intermediate stage of neuronal differentiation, based on morphologic characteristics and immunophenotyping with antibodies specific for various differentiation markers. The still more differentiated ganglionic cells seen in ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas exhibited much less intense immunoreactivity with anti-Bcl-2 antibodies, suggesting down-regulation of bcl-2 during final terminal differentiation. In contrast to cells with neuronal features, the stromal Schwann cells were uniformly negative for Bcl-2 protein in all histologic grades of tumors. Thus, bcl-2 expression in NBs was limited to cells of the neuronal lineage and tended to be highest in tumor cells with the characteristics of ganglionic cell precursors. The expression of bcl-2 in the normal fetal and postnatal adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia paralleled that seen in NBs, consistent with previous suggestions that NB reflects a block in the normal differentiation process. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that the levels of the Bcl-2 protein are developmentally regulated in normal and neoplastic cells of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, and suggest that this oncoprotein may be useful as a differentiation marker for subclassification of NBs for prognostic purposes and for investigations of normal neuronal maturation. Furthermore, strong Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was detected in islets of residual tumor cells in 6 of 7 specimens obtained from 5 patients after therapy, suggesting that this oncoprotein may be cytoprotective for NB cells in vivo.",M1
7804984,"Major histocompatibility proteins, anti-Hu antibodies, and paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis in neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Patients with neuroendocrine-related tumors and paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM) or paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy (PSN) develop high titers of antibodies, called anti-Hu, against neuronal proteins expressed in their tumors, usually small cell lung cancer (SCLC). These tumors appear to be more indolent than those not associated with anti-Hu antibodies. The aims of this study were to determine 1) if patients with neuroblastoma (NB) also have anti-Hu antibodies, 2) the correlation between antibody titer and survival, and 3) if coexpression of Hu antigens and major histocompatibility proteins (MHC) by the tumor correlates with the development of anti-Hu associated PEM/PSN: METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, the sera of 109 patients with NB whose neurologic condition was concealed at the time of the study were examined for the presence of anti-Hu antibodies. The expression of Hu antigens and MHC proteins in 50 nonselected NB and 26 SCLC (16 known to be from seropositive and 10 from seronegative patients) was examined using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Four Stage 4 NB patients were seropositive and had longer survival (median 86 months) than 71 seronegative patients in the same age group and with the same tumor stage (median survival, 28.5 months). Seventy-eight percent of NB and all SCLC expressed Hu antigens. Overall, 17 of 20 tumors from seropositive patients expressed both Hu and MHC Class I proteins, but only 4 of 30 tumors from seronegative patients expressed both proteins (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Some patients with NB develop anti-Hu antibodies; a search for that type of tumor is indicated in seropositive children, 2) most <e>NBs</e> and SCLCs express Hu antigens but only a few are associated with anti-Hu antibodies, and 3) Class I MHC expressed by some Hu antigen-bearing tumors may play a role in the development of anti-Hu associated PEM/PSN:",M1
7576964,"Evaluation of CD44 prognostic value in neuroblastoma: comparison with the other prognostic factors.CD44 gene products are potential markers of aggressiveness in different tumour models, a result which prompted us to study clinical neuroblastoma (NB) specimens. CD44 expression was determined by immunostaining of 52 tumour samples from newly diagnosed NB with a monoclonal antibody (J173) directed against an epitope common to all CD44 isoforms. CD44 immunoreactivity was detected in 37 of the tumours (71%). CD44 was expressed in all 22 <e>NBs</e> with favourable prognoses (stages 1, 2 or 4S), but only 50% (15/30) of advanced NB (stages 3 and 4) (P &lt; 10(-4)), suggesting that the absence, rather than the overexpression, of CD44 is a signal of tumour aggressiveness. The cumulative progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with CD44 positive tumours compared with patients with CD44 negative tumours (P &lt; 10(-5)). More importantly, progression-free survival was also significantly higher in CD44 positive patients within the high-risk group (P &lt; 0.01). In univariate analysis, we tested the prognostic value of tumour expression of CD44 in comparison with tumour stage, age, tumour histology, and presence or absence of amplification of the MYCN protooncogene. All five measures had significant prognostic value. The expression of CD44 and the absence of MYCN amplification were the most powerful predictors of a favourable outcome. In a multivariate analysis of these measures, CD44 expression and tumour stage were the only independent prognostic factors for the prediction of patient survival. NB is the first clinical model described in which tumour aggressiveness correlates with repression rather than stimulation of CD44 expression. We recommend the use of CD44 as an additional biological marker in the initial staging of NB.",M1
7576955,"Regression and progression in neuroblastoma. Does genetics predict tumour behaviour?Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous disease. The clinical course may range from spontaneous regression and maturation to very aggressive behaviour. Stage 4s is a unique subcategory of NB, generally associated with good prognosis, despite skin and/or liver involvement and the frequent presence of tumour cells in the bone marrow. Another type of NB is the locally invasive tumour without bone and bone marrow involvement which can also have a good prognosis, irrespective of lymph node involvement. Unfortunately, there is only limited biological information on such tumours which have not been treated with cytotoxic therapy despite lymph node involvement, residual tumour mass after surgery and/or bone marrow infiltration. In order to find specific genetic changes common to <e>NBs</e> with a benign clinical course, we studied the genetic abnormalities of these tumours and compared them with highly aggressive tumours. We analysed a series of 54 localised and stage 4s tumours by means of in situ hybridisation performed on fresh cells or on paraffin embedded tissues. In addition, we performed classical cytogenetics, Southern blotting and PCR analysis on fresh tumour tissue. The majority of patients had been treated with surgery alone, and in a number of patients tumour resection was incomplete. Deletions at 1p36 and amplifications of the MYCN oncogene were absent, and diploidy or tetraploidy were not seen in any case, with residual localised tumours possessing a favourable outcome. Unexpectedly, one patient with a tetraploid 4s tumour without any genetic structural changes not receiving any cytotoxic treatment, did well. Interestingly, this genetic spectrum contrasted with that of progressing tumours, in which most had genetic aberrations, the deletion at 1p36 being the most common event. These data, although limited, suggest that an intact 1p36 (recognised by D1Z2), the absence of MYCN amplification and near-triploidy (at least in localised tumours), represent prerequisites for spontaneous regression and/or maturation.",M1
7576940,"Schwann cells in neuroblastoma.Why should we consider Schwann cells when we are interested in the biology of neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>)? Although we are familiar with the term  stroma-rich  NB, we basically think of a favourable prognostic subgroup, histologically distinguished by the development of a prominent Schwann cell-stroma. According to current opinion on the maturation processes in NBs, the NB-associated Schwann cell is believed to represent a differentiation product of the NB cell, and we therefore do not envisage the Schwann cell as having any important role in NBs. However, our interest was raised after having realised that Schwann cells in NBs are normal cells, very likely attracted to the neoplastic neuroblasts. But what role does this cell play in these tumours? Can we still reduce the appearance of Schwann cells in NBs to an epi-phenomenon or is this cell population responsible for the differentiation of certain NBs? If so, will it be possible to use their strategies to induce differentiation of neuroblasts and so render them non-aggressive, mature ganglionic cells? To shed light on the possible interactions between normal Schwann cells and NB cells, the maturation capacity of NBs and the genetic constitution of the two main cell populations in these tumours are briefly reviewed. Some data leading to the current view on the origin of the Schwann cells in NBs, and several physiological aspects of the Schwann cells, including normal neurone-Schwann cell interactions, are detailed.",M1
8078299,"Expression of the neural intermediate filament proteins peripherin and neurofilament-66/alpha-internexin in neuroblastoma.BACKGROUND: Peripherin and neurofilament (NF)-66/alpha-internexin are recently characterized, neuron-specific intermediate filament proteins that are expressed in the developing peripheral nervous system. Peripherin, in particular, is highly enriched in neuronal derivatives of the neural crest. We speculated that these intermediate filament proteins would be expressed in neuroblastoma (NB), a neural crest-derived tumor with many neuronal features. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By use of antibodies specific to peripherin and NF-66/alpha-internexin, we detected these proteins on Western blots of NB tissue extracts and in paraffin sections of <e>NBs</e>. RESULTS: Western blotting indicated that NB tumor extracts contained immunoreactive proteins that co-migrated with rat peripherin and human NF-66/alpha-internexin from normal tissues, thus establishing the specificity of the antibodies for these proteins in tumors. The antibody specific for peripherin labeled all NBs, including immature NBs, composite ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas. In contrast, the NF-66/alpha-internexin antibody labeled only 50% of NBs, and only weakly labeled most ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas. Neither antibody labeled other small blue cell tumors such as lymphomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, Wilms' tumors, and Ewing sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of the peripherin labeling of NB and the ability of the peripherin antibody to label the entire spectrum of NBs, including ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas, indicate that this intermediate filament protein has potential as a diagnostic marker for these related neural crest neoplasms.",M1
7809504,"Pathology of neuroblastic tumors.Histogenesis, basic histologic features, nomenclature, and criteria for diagnosis and prognostic classifications based on morphological features of neuroblastic tumors (NTs) are described.

The following three basic types of NTs are recognized: neuroblastoma (<e>NBs</e>) and ganglioneuroblastomas (GNBs) and ganglioneuromas (GNs). NBs can be undifferentiated, poorly differentiated or differentiating; GNBs have the following three subtypes. (1) nodular, (2) intermixed, and (3) borderline. The conventional and recommended terminology and Shimada terminology of NTs are described (Tables 1 and 2). There are three basic pathologic components of NTs, neuroblastomatous, ganglioneuromatous, and intermediate components (Figs 3, 5, and 7). There are two major prognostic classifications based on morphological features of NTs, Shimada classification and histologic grading (Tables 3 and 4).",M1
1362216,"Differences of L-myc polymorphic patterns of neuroblastoma in patients under 1 year versus older ages: a preliminary report.The age of the patient at the onset of symptoms or at diagnosis is generally accepted as one of the most important prognostic factors of neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>). Children less than 1 year of age have a better survival rate than older patients, but the reason for this is unknown. Forty-eight unselected NB patients were divided into two groups: less than 1 year (younger NB patient) and over 1 year (older NB patient) of age at diagnosis. Two of 12 younger NB patients and 18 of 36 older NB patients had N-myc amplification in their tumors. To elucidate further the possible genetic difference between younger and older NB patients, studies of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the L-myc gene was carried out in these two groups. The L-myc locus showed 2-allele polymorphism, allele L(10 kb) and S (6.6 kb), after digestion with EcoRI. Patients homozygous for L-band have been reported as individuals having less metastatic potential in some cancers. The allele frequencies of L and S in neuroblastomas of younger NB patients were 0.50 and 0.50, while those of older NB patients were 0.35 and 0.65, respectively. Although we did not determine L-myc RFLP in normal tissue of individual patients, we expect that the distribution of allele L and S is partly affected by possible allelic loss involving the L-myc region. However, the L-myc RFLP patterns in younger NB patients were the same as those of normal individuals and significantly differed from those of older NB patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
1742726,"Differential expression of bcl2 protooncogene in neuroblastoma and other human tumor cell lines of neural origin.The bcl2 protooncogene was originally discovered because of its involvement in t(14;18) chromosomal translocations frequently found in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The expression of this gene is reported to be highly tissue specific, with bcl2 mRNAs being readily detectable only in hematolymphoid tissues and brain. To explore the possible involvement of bcl2 in neural tumors, we surveyed a variety of tumor cell lines for the presence of the p26-BCL2 protein by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting methods. Very high levels of BCL2 protein were found in three of nine neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines examined; these levels of p26-BCL2 were comparable to lymphoma cell lines that contain a t(14;18). Despite the impressive relative amounts of BCL2 protein, however, no structural alterations or changes in the methylation status of bcl2 genes were detected in these NB cell lines by conventional Southern blotting. Of the other NB cell lines surveyed, three contained intermediate levels of BCL2 and another three cell lines had little or no detectable BCL2 protein, raising the possibility that determination of relative levels of BCL2 protein may help to segregate neuroblastomas into groups with different biological and clinical characteristics. BCL2 protein levels were not influenced by induction of neuronal differentiation with nerve growth factor in two of the two cell lines examined [SH-SY5Y (high BCL2); GICAN (low BCL2)] and did not correlate with N-MYC gene amplification or expression of nerve growth factor receptors. NB cell lines that contained little or no detectable BCL2 protein, however, tended to contain significant proportions of flat epithelioid cells, whereas bcl2-expressing cell lines were composed primarily of neuronal-like cells, suggesting that expression of this protooncogene correlates with the differentiation characteristics of these tumor cell lines. In addition to <e>NBs</e>, lower levels of BCL2 protein were also found in a variety of other neural crest-derived tumors and tumor cell lines, including some neuroepitheliomas, Ewing's sarcomas, neurofibromas, and melanomas. With regard to tumors of central nervous system origin, bcl2 expression was absent from most medulloblastomas but was detected at moderate to low levels in a retinoblastoma and some glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. Taken together, these findings imply that bcl2 protooncogene expression is differentially regulated within the various lineages of cells that give rise to the nervous system.",M1
2284101,"Prolonged N-myc protein half-life in a neuroblastoma cell line lacking N-myc amplification.Genomic amplification of the oncogene N-myc is associated with rapid tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with neuroblastoma (NB). However, 40% of <e>NBs</e> which lack N-myc amplification are also clinically aggressive. Factors other than N-myc copy number must therefore play a role in determining tumor progression in these NBs. We have established an unusual human NB cell line (NBL-S) from the primary tumor of a patient with rapidly progressive disease which lacks N-myc amplification. The doubling time in vitro (48 h) and the time from injection of 2 x 10(7) cells to detectable tumors in nude mice (46 days) in similar to NB cell lines with amplified N-myc. However, karyotype analysis reveals no evidence of double minutes (DMs), homogeneously staining regions (HSRs), or chromosome 1p deletions, features commonly seen in NB cell lines. The cells have the cell surface phenotype typical of N-myc amplified NB (HLA-A,B,C negative and HSAN 1.2 positive), and similar to other NB cell lines, N-myc RNA and protein are expressed. Interestingly, the half-life of the N-myc protein in NBL-S is prolonged (approximately 100 min) compared to the short N-myc protein half-life previously described in N-myc amplified NB cell lines (approximately 30 min). Because N-myc protein is thought to have a regulatory role, prolongation of the half-life of this protein may be an important factor in the regulation of growth in NBs which lack N-myc amplification and rapidly progress.",M1
1701347,"In vitro modulation and relationship between N-myc and HLA class I RNA steady-state levels in human neuroblastoma cells.Neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors are characterized by low HLA class I expression. The majority of neuroblastoma cell lines and a high percentage of disseminated tumors display amplification of the nuclear protooncogene N-myc. An inverse correlation between HLA class I expression and N-myc amplification and overexpression has been recently described in neuroblastomas (<e>NBs</e>). In this study we have shown that cytokines (recombinant gamma-interferon, recombinant alpha-tumor necrosis factor), differentiation agents (dibutyryl cyclic AMP, phorbol myristate acetate) and growth factors (nerve growth factor, epithelial growth factor) were able to influence the growth rate and surface expression of HLA class I molecules as well as of a tumor-associated antigen on 2 representative NB cell lines. Induced decreased growth rate in NB cells was not always related to decreased N-myc expression. Analysis at the mRNA level revealed that both N-myc and HLA class I RNA steady-state levels could be modulated by several substances, including recombinant gamma-interferon, phorbol myristate acetate, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and epithelial growth factor and were not necessarily linked. An inverse correlation between N-myc and HLA mRNA levels was observed only after exposure of NB cells to recombinant alpha-tumor necrosis factor. We conclude that N-myc and HLA class I RNA steady-state levels can be modulated independently and suggest that they are not necessarily inversely regulated.",M1
2400996,"Differential spectrum of expression of neural cell adhesion molecule isoforms and L1 adhesion molecules on human neuroectodermal tumors.A series of four medulloblastomas, seven neuroblastomas (Nb), two ependymomas, and three gliomas, human neuroectodermal tumors, were screened for their expression of adhesion molecules L1, carcinoembryonic antigen, neural cell adhesion molecule isoforms (N-CAM) and HNK1 epitope by Western blotting and double immunofluorescence labeling. All seven neuroblastomas, whatever their differentiated state, expressed L1, a neural cell surface developmental antigen, whereas all other tumors tested were negative. All tumors expressed N-CAM; however, a large diversity was observed among the isoforms. Low sialylated N-CAM 140 was present, with different intensity, in ependymomas and astrocytomas. High sialylated isoforms were detected by a monoclonal antibody (anti-MenB) specifically recognizing high polymers of alpha 2-8 linked neuraminic acid. They were expressed in all medulloblastomas studied (4 of 4), and in 4 of 7 <e>Nbs</e> examined. Negative cases corresponded to tumors having undergone chemotherapeutic treatment or to ganglioneuroma. The interconversion from high to low sialylated forms might reflect changes which are critical for the conversion of Nbs into benign ganglioneuromas. HNK1 epitope was expressed on a large diversity of molecules by nearly all tumors except two Nbs which were also negative with anti-MenB antibody. This simultaneous loss of carbohydrate epitopes could correlate with higher maturation states of the tumors. None of the tumors expressed carcinoembryonic antigen. Therefore, anti-L1 and anti-MenB antibodies define differentiation-related antigens that could differentiate between Nbs and other tumors and may prove helpful in diagnosis and understanding of the biological nature of neuroectodermal tumors. An immunodot assay was set up and allowed to titrate the presence of polysialic acid units in cerebrospinal fluid from patients presenting meningeal spread of medulloblastomas. It could help to assess metastasis and to monitor the effects of chemotherapeutic treatment on polysialylated N-CAM positive tumors.",M1

Viral infections were detected in 68.4% of patients with a predominance of EBV (63.2%), followed by HBV (19.2%) and HCV (8.8%). Monoclonal gammopathy detected in 38.6% of cases correlated with the presence of EBV DNA (p=0.002) and HCV RNA (p=0.04). Clonal Ig and/or TCR gene rearrangements occurred in 73.9% of patients. The presence of at least one of the studied parameters preceded the development of malignancy in 22 patients. Systematic PCR analysis for viral infections and Ig/TCR gene rearrangements, supplemented by detection of monoclonal proteins, is advantageous in monitoring <e>NBS</e> patients before severe complications of the disease, including cancer, appear.",M2
20089118,"Telomerase upregulation is a postcrisis event during  senescence bypass and immortalization of two  Nijmegen breakage syndrome T cell cultures.Our knowledge on immortalization and telomere biology is mainly based on genetically manipulated cells analyzed before and many population doublings post growth crisis. The general view is that growth crisis is telomere length (TL) dependent and that escape from crisis is coupled to increased expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, telomerase activity upregulation and TL stabilization. Here we have analyzed the process of spontaneous immortalization of human T cells, regarding pathways involved in senescence and telomerase regulation. Two Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) T cell cultures (S3R and S4) showed gradual telomere attrition until a period of growth crisis followed by the outgrowth of immortalized cells. Whole genome expression analysis indicated differences between pre-, early post- and late postcrisis cells. Early postcrisis cells demonstrated a logarithmic growth curve, very short telomeres and, notably, no increase in hTERT or telomerase activity despite downregulation of several negative hTERT regulators (e.g. FOS, JUN D, SMAD3, RUNX2, TNF-a and TGFb-R2). Thereafter, cMYC mRNA increased in parallel with increased hTERT expression, telomerase activity and elongation of short telomeres, indicating a step-wise activation of hTERT transcription involving reduction of negative regulators followed by activation of positive regulator(s). Gene expression analysis indicated that cells escaped growth crisis by deregulated DNA damage response and senescence controlling genes, including downregulation of ATM, CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2D (p19) and ASF1A and upregulation of CDK4, TWIST1, TP73L (p63) and SYK. Telomerase upregulation was thus found to be uncoupled to escape of growth crisis but rather a later event in the immortalization process of NBS T cell cultures.",M2
19782649,"NBS1 cooperates with homologous recombination to counteract chromosome breakage during replication.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is characterized by genome instability and cancer predisposition. NBS patients contain a mutation in the NBS1 gene, which encodes the NBS1 component of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response complex MRE11/RAD50/NBS1. To investigate the NBS phenotype in more detail, we combined the mouse mimic of the most common patient mutation (Nbs1(Delta B/DeltaB)) with a Rad54 null mutation, which diminishes homologous recombination. Double mutant cells were particularly sensitive to treatments that cause single strand breaks (SSBs), presumably because these SSBs can be converted into detrimental DSBs upon passage of a replication fork. The persistent presence of nuclear RAD51 foci and increased levels of chromatid type breaks in metaphase spreads indicated that replication-associated DSBs are repaired inefficiently in the double mutant cells. We conclude that Nbs1 and Rad54 function cooperatively, but in separate pathways to counteract this type of DNA damage and discuss mechanistic implications of these findings.",M2
19782616,"Oral findings in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome: a preliminary study.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the oral cavity status of patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>), an inherited genetic disorder that belongs to the group of chromosome instability syndromes and is characterized by microcephaly, a distinct facial appearance, growth retardation, radiation sensitivity, and immunodeficiency. STUDY DESIGN: Oral examination was conducted and immunological status assessed in 21 NBS patients (1.7-20.7 years old) and 21 healthy controls (5-21 years old). The differences between the frequency and severity of clinical manifestations and their correlation with immune parameters were analyzed by Student t test, the chi-square test, and Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: Lesions of the oral mucosa and gingivitis were diagnosed more frequently in NBS patients than in controls. The mean Gingival Index was significantly higher in NBS subjects (P = 0.00043). Candidiasis was detected in 6 patients (28.6%) and in none of the healthy controls. Immune deficiency (humoral and/or cellular) was detected in 20 of 21 (95.2%) NBS patients. There was a significant association between severity of gingival inflammation and reduced number of B- and/or CD3+/CD4+ T cells combined with IgA+IgG4 deficiency. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that oral manifestations diagnosed in NBS patients were associated with combined deficiencies of the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. We postulate that periodical examination of the oral cavity is essential for early medical intervention.",M2
19635536,"Clinical variability and expression of the NBN c.657del5 allele in Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome.Patients affected by the autosomal recessive Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (<e>NBS</e> [MIM 251260]) have possibly the highest risk for developing a malignancy of all the chromosomal instability syndromes. This reflects the profound disturbance to genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis that is caused by the mutation of the essential mammalian gene, NBN. Whilst null-mutation of Nbn is lethal in the mouse, NBS patients survive due to the fact that the common human founder mutation, found in over 90% of patients, is in fact hypomorphic and leads, by alternative translation, to varying amounts of a partially functional carboxy-terminal protein fragment, p70-nibrin. The expression level of p70-nibrin correlates with cancer incidence amongst patients. Using real-time PCR we have now found that the variation in p70-nibrin expression cannot be attributed to differences in mRNA quantity and that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is not responsible for the observed variation. We discuss an alternative explanation for p70-nibrin expression variation.",M2
19580482,"Dose response of gamma rays and iron nuclei for induction of chromosomal aberrations in normal and repair-deficient cell lines.We studied the effects of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair deficiencies on chromosomal aberration frequency using low doses (&lt;1 Gy) of gamma rays and high-energy iron ions (LET = 151 keV/microm). Chromosomal aberrations were measured using the fluorescence whole-chromosome painting technique. The cell lines included fibroblasts deficient in ATM (product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or <e>NBS</e> (product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome) and gliomablastoma cells proficient in or lacking DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity. The yields of both simple and complex chromosomal aberrations were increased in DSB repair-defective cells compared to normal cells; the increase was more than twofold higher for gamma rays compared to iron nuclei. For gamma-ray-induced aberrations, the ATM- and NBS-defective lines were found to have significantly larger quadratic components compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex aberrations, while the linear dose-response term was significantly higher only for the NBS cells. For simple and complex aberrations induced by iron nuclei, regression models preferred purely linear and quadratic dose responses, respectively, for each cell line studied. RBEs were reduced relative to normal cells for all of the DSB repair-defective lines, with the DNA-PK-deficient cells found to have RBEs near unity. The large increase in the quadratic dose-response terms in the DSB repair-deficient cell lines points to the importance of the functions of ATM and NBS in chromatin modifications to facilitate correct DSB repair and to minimize aberration formation. The differences found between AT and NBS cells at lower doses suggest important questions about the applicability of observations of radiation sensitivity at high doses to low-dose exposures.",M2
19409520,"Human RAD50 deficiency in a Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder.The MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Hypomorphic mutations in NBN (previously known as NBS1) and MRE11A give rise to the autosomal-recessive diseases Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), respectively. To date, no disease due to RAD50 deficiency has been described. Here, we report on a patient previously diagnosed as probably having NBS, with microcephaly, mental retardation, 'bird-like' face, and short stature. At variance with this diagnosis, she never had severe infections, had normal immunoglobulin levels, and did not develop lymphoid malignancy up to age 23 years. We found that she is compound heterozygous for mutations in the RAD50 gene that give rise to low levels of unstable RAD50 protein. Cells from the patient were characterized by chromosomal instability; radiosensitivity; failure to form DNA damage-induced MRN foci; and impaired radiation-induced activation of and downstream signaling through the ATM protein, which is defective in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. These cells were also impaired in G1/S cell-cycle-checkpoint activation and displayed radioresistant DNA synthesis and G2-phase accumulation. The defective cellular phenotype was rescued by wild-type RAD50. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a patient with a RAD50 deficiency that results in a clinical phenotype that can be classified as an NBS-like disorder (NBSLD).",M2

19171781,"Differential DNA damage signaling accounts for distinct neural apoptotic responses in ATLD and <e>NBS</e>.The MRN complex (Mre11/RAD50/NBS1) and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) are critical for the cellular response to DNA damage. ATM disruption causes ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), while MRN dysfunction can lead to A-T-like disease (ATLD) or Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). Neuropathology is a hallmark of these diseases, whereby neurodegeneration occurs in A-T and ATLD while microcephaly characterizes NBS. To understand the contrasting neuropathology resulting from Mre11 or Nbs1 hypomorphic mutations, we analyzed neural tissue from Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) and Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB) mice after genotoxic stress. We found a pronounced resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis after ionizing radiation or DNA ligase IV (Lig4) loss in the Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) nervous system that was associated with defective Atm activation and phosphorylation of its substrates Chk2 and p53. Conversely, DNA damage-induced Atm phosphorylation was defective in Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB) neural tissue, although apoptosis occurred normally. We also conditionally disrupted Lig4 throughout the nervous system using Nestin-cre (Lig4(Nes-Cre)), and while viable, these mice showed pronounced microcephaly and a prominent age-related accumulation of DNA damage throughout the brain. Either Atm-/- or Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) genetic backgrounds, but not Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB), rescued Lig4(Nes-Cre) microcephaly. Thus, DNA damage signaling in the nervous system is different between ATLD and NBS and likely explains their respective neuropathology.",M2

Chemotherapy consisting of COPP/ABV regimen with reduction at 75% of full doses was employed. During this treatment, no major toxic or infectious complications were observed. Complete remission was achieved lasting now for 20 months. In DNA repair disorders, prognosis of Hodgkin disease is poor as opposed to excellent overall prognosis in general pediatric population.

We here report two adult siblings that are compound heterozygotes for two previously unreported NBN nonsense mutations. These patients presented with the unique clinical symptom of fertility defects. Contrasting with the absence of any developmental abnormality, biological analyses revealed defects similar to those observed in NBS patients, including chromosomal instability, cellular hyperradiosensitivity and checkpoint defects as measured by radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS). NBN mutations should thus be considered a new cause of infertility, and should be searched for if associated with the biological abnormalities of NBS.",M2

PROCEDURE: Since 1996, 17 patients with a median age of 9.5 years who had NBS, were treated for NHL. NHL type, stage, chemotherapy, dose modifications, chemotherapy delays, response to chemotherapy, toxicity, outcome and correlation of drug reduction with response to treatment and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Nine patients had TNHL, eight BNHL. TNHL patients received BFM and BNHL LMB type protocols. Doses of cytostatics were reduced in the first chemotherapy courses. Further modifications depended on severity of complications. None of the patients complied with timing of chemotherapy. Complete remissions after induction were achieved in 8 of 9 TNHL and 3 out 8 of BNHL patients. All patients experienced grade 4 toxicities. Two patients died from complications. Six of 17 patients are alive. All received more than 80% of recommended doses of chemotherapy. No differences in the type, number of responses or grade 3 and 4 toxicities between patients receiving less or more than 80% of drug doses were observed. Treatment related deaths concerned patients who received less than 80% of drug doses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NBS develop both T and B cell lymphomas. Treatment outcome is poor and might be improved by administering over 80% of drug doses. Although toxicity often depends upon drug doses, our patients experienced equal grade 3 and 4 toxicities whether they received more or less than 80% of the chemotherapeutic agents.",M2
18835245,"Reduced expression of SRC family kinases decreases PI3K activity in NBS1-/- lymphoblasts.SRC family kinases (SFKs) are involved in the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). In addition, the activity of this lipid kinase can be regulated by the DNA repair protein NBS1. Here, we describe a disturbed expression of some members of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase family in lymphoblastoid cell lines generated from cells of Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) patients. Especially, only minor amounts of the kinases LCK and HCK are expressed in the NBS1(-/-) cell lines as compared to the consanguineous NBS1(+/-) cells. We demonstrate that SFK activity is important for a proper activation of PI3K in these cells and that it is reduced in NBS1(-/-) cells. We provide evidence that the observed reduced PI3K activity in NBS lymphoblasts is caused by an impaired expression of the SFKs LCK and/or HCK. Thus, our data establish a new function for the NBS1 protein as a regulator of PI3K activity via SFK members.",M2

In Poland 105 NBS cases showing mutations in the NBS gene (nibrin, NBN), have been diagnosed, approximately 53% of which have developed cancer, mainly (&gt;90%) lymphoid malignancies. This study is based upon the largest reported group of NBS-associated lymphomas. The predominant lymphoma types found in these 14 NBS children were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL/ALL), all showing monoclonal Ig/TCR rearrangements. The spectrum of NBS lymphomas is completely different from sporadic paediatric lymphomas and lymphomas in other immunodeficient patients. Morphological and molecular analysis of consecutive lymphoproliferations in six NBS patients revealed two cases of true secondary lymphoma. Furthermore, 9/13 NBS patients with lymphomas analysed by split-signal FISH showed breaks in the Ig or TCR loci, several of which likely represent chromosome aberrations. The combined data would fit a model in which an NBN gene defect results in a higher frequency of DNA misrejoining during double-strand break (DSB) repair, thereby contributing to an increased likelihood of lymphoma formation in NBS patients.",M2
18771529,"Impaired removal of DNA interstrand cross-link in Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Fanconi anemia, but not in BRCA-defective group.Human diseases characterized by a high sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL) and predisposition to malignance include Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) and Fanconi anemia (FA), which is further classified to three groups: (1) FA core-complex group; (2) FA-ID complex group; and (3) breast cancer (BRCA)-defective group. The relationships between these four groups and the basic defect in ICL repair remain unclear. To study the details of ICL repair in NBS and FA, a highly sensitive PPB (psoralen-polyethylene oxide-biotin) dot blot assay was developed to provide sensitive quantitative measurements of ICL during the removal process. Studies utilizing this assay demonstrated a decreased rate of ICL removal in cells belonging to the FA core-complex group (e.g. groups A and G) and FA-ID complex group (group D2), while ICL removal was restored to normal levels after these cells were complemented with wt-FANCA, wt-FANCG and wt-FANCD2. Conversely, FA-D1 cells with a defective BRCA2 protein displayed normal ICL removal, although they were compromised with respect to recombination. This normal ICL removal rate in recombination-deficient cells was confirmed by using XRCC3-defective Chinese hamster cells, which are similarly compromised with respect to recombination and are sensitive to mitomycin C. The present study also showed that cells from patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome were defective in ICL removal, while they were impaired in the recombination. These results indicate an obvious defect of FA and NBS in the ICL repair process, except in the BRCA-defective group, and a separate step of recombination-mediated repair pathway between the BRCA group and NBS.",M2
18724061,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome and functions of the responsible protein, NBS1.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is a rare recessive genetic disorder, characterized by bird-like facial appearance, early growth retardation, congenital microcephaly, immunodeficiency and high frequency of malignancies. NBS belongs to the so-called chromosome instability syndromes; in fact, NBS cells display spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and are hypersensitive to DNA double-strand break-inducing agents, such as ionizing radiations. NBS1, the gene underlying the disease, is located on human chromosome 8q21. The disease appears to be prevalent in the Eastern and Central European population where more than 90% of patients are homozygous for the founder mutation 657del5 leading to a truncated variant of the protein. NBS1 forms a multimeric complex with MRE11/RAD50 nuclease at the C-terminus and retains or recruits them at the vicinity of sites of DNA damage by direct binding to histone H2AX, which is phosphorylated by PI3-kinase family, such as ATM, in response to DNA damage. Thereafter, the NBS1-complex proceeds to rejoin double-strand breaks predominantly by homologous recombination repair in vertebrates. NBS cells also show to be defective in the activation of intra-S phase checkpoint. We review here some cellular and molecular aspects of NBS, which might contribute to the clinical symptoms of the disease.",M2
18593981,"Mutations in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene in medulloblastomas.PURPOSE: Cerebellar medulloblastoma is a highly malignant, invasive embryonal tumor with preferential manifestation in children. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) with NBS1 germ-line mutations is a rare autosomal recessive disease with clinical features that include microcephaly, mental and growth retardation, immunodeficiency, increased radiosensitivity, and predisposition to cancer. There may be functional interactions between NBS1 and the TP53 pathways. The objective of the present study is to assess whether NBS1 mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic medulloblastomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-two cases of medulloblastomas were screened for mutations in the NBS1 gene (all 16 exons) and the TP53 gene (exons 5-8) by single-stranded conformational polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Seven of 42 (17%) medulloblastomas carried a total of 15 NBS1 mutations. Of these, 10 were missense point mutations and 5 were intronic splicing mutations. None of these were reported previously as germ-line mutations in NBS patients. No NBS1 mutations were detected in peritumoral brain tissues available in two patients. Of 5 medulloblastomas with TP53 mutations, 4 (80%) contained NBS1 mutations, and there was a significant association between TP53 mutations and NBS1 mutations (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of medulloblastomas characterized by NBS1 mutations typically associated with mutational inactivation of the TP53 gene.",M2
18364569,"Telomere length in lymphoblast cell lines derived from clinically radiosensitive cancer patients.Approximately 1-5 percent of cancer patients suffer from significant side effects in normal tissue after radiotherapy (RT). Although RT is an effective cancer therapy, treatment dose intensities are restricted to minimize the incidence of such normal tissue reactions. Therefore, most patients receive lower dose intensities than can be tolerated in normal tissue. A primary aim for radiation oncology is to identify radiosensitive (RS) individuals prior to treatment. Such predictive ability should result in an improvement in tumor control rates and/or a reduction in the incidence of RT side effects. Recent evidence suggests a link between RS and telomere length. A positive correlation between cellular RS and telomere length in a cohort of breast cancer patients has been reported. Furthermore,individuals with cancer-prone recessive RS syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome(<e>NBS</e>), have shortened telomeres. To determine whether the association between telomere length and RS could be used as a predictive assay to prospectively identify RS cancer patients, we utilized a bank of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 33 RS patients, along with 18 LCL samples from RT patients who did not have severe reactions, to assess the link between RS and telomere length. We found a subset of RS patient LCLs had abnormally long telomere lengths, so these data suggest that RS could potentially be predicted for a subset of RS patients based on telomere length in LCLs, and contribute to therapy individualization.",M2

Compound heterozygous 657del5/R215W NBS patients display a clinical phenotype more severe than the majority of NBS patients homozygous for the 657del5 mutation. The NBS1 protein, mutated in NBS patients, contains a FHA/BRCT domain necessary for the DNA-double strand break (DSB) damage response. Recently, a second BRCT domain has been identified, however, its role is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the R215W mutation in NBS1 impairs histone gamma-H2AX binding after induction of DNA damage, leading to a delay in DNA-DSB rejoining. Molecular modelling reveals that the 215 residue of NBS1 is located between the two BRCT domains, affecting their relative orientation that appears critical for gamma-H2AX binding. Present data represent the first evidence for the role of NBS1 tandem BRCT domains in gamma-H2AX recognition, and could explain the severe phenotype observed in 657del5/R215W NBS patients.",M2
18248856,"Growth of persistent foci of DNA damage checkpoint factors is essential for amplification of G1 checkpoint signaling.Several DNA damage checkpoint factors form nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Although the number of the initial foci decreases concomitantly with DNA double-strand break repair, some fraction of foci persists. To date, the physiological role of the persistent foci has been poorly understood. Here we examined foci of Ser1981-phosphorylated ATM in normal human diploid cells exposed to 1Gy of X-rays. While the initial foci size was approximately 0.6microm, the one or two of persistent focus (foci) grew, whose diameter reached 1.6microm or more in diameter at 24h after IR. All of the grown persistent foci of phosphorylated ATM colocalized with the persistent foci of Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2AX, MDC1, 53BP1, and NBS1, which also grew similarly. When G0-synchronized normal human cells were released immediately after 1Gy of X-rays and incubated for 24h, the grown large phosphorylated ATM foci (&gt; or =1.6microm) were rarely (av. 0.9%) observed in S phase cells, while smaller foci (&lt;1.6microm) were frequently (av. 45.9%) found. We observed significant phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in cells with a single grown phosphorylated ATM focus. Furthermore, persistent inhibition of foci growth of phosphorylated ATM by an ATM inhibitor, KU55933, completely abrogated p53 phosphorylation. Defective growth of the persistent IR-induced foci was observed in primary fibroblasts derived from ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) patients, which were abnormal in IR-induced G1 checkpoint. These results indicate that the growth of the persistent foci of the DNA damage checkpoint factors plays a pivotal role in G1 arrest, which amplifies G1 checkpoint signals sufficiently for phosphorylating p53 in cells with a limited number of remaining foci.",M2

18073374,"Cancer risk of heterozygotes with the NBN founder mutation.BACKGROUND: The autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is associated with increased risk of lymphoid malignancies and other cancers. Cells from NBS patients contain many double-stranded DNA breaks. More than 90% of NBS patients are homozygous for a founder mutation, 657del5, in the NBN gene. We investigated the 657del5 carrier status of cancer patients among blood relatives (i.e., first-, through fourth-degree relatives) of NBS patients in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to test the hypothesis that NBN heterozygotes have an increased cancer risk. METHODS: Medical information was compiled from 344 blood relatives of NBS patients in 24 different NBS families from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2003. The 657del5 carrier status of subjects was unknown at the time of their recruitment but was later determined from blood samples collected at the time of the interview. Medical records and death certificates were used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. For the relatives with cancer who are not obligate heterozygotes (such as parents and two grandparents in consanguineous families), the observed and expected number of mutation carriers were compared by use of the index-test method, which estimated the risk of cancer associated with carrying the mutation. All P values were two-sided. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 344 blood relatives had confirmed cases of any type of cancer; 11 of these 13 cancer patients carried the NBN 657del5 mutation, compared with 6.0 expected (P = .005). Among the 56 grandparents with complete data from 14 NBS families, 10 of the 28 carriers of 657del5, but only one of the 28 noncarriers, developed cancer (odds ratio = 10.7, 95% CI = 1.4 to 81.5; P&lt;.004).

In addition, NBS patient cells were found to have elevated levels of chromosomal damage and to be sensitive to ionizing irradiation (IR). This radiosensitivity had fatal consequences in some undiagnosed patients. The most dangerous DNA lesion caused by IR is considered to be the double-strand break (DSB) and indeed, NBS patient cells are sensitive to all mutagens that produce DSBs directly or indirectly.

The majority of patients (&gt;90%) are homozygous for a founder mutation. Despite this genetic homogeneity, the syndrome shows considerable clinical variability, for example, in age at development of a malignancy. We hypothesised that one reason for such variation might be individual differences in the clearance of heavily damaged precancerous cells by apoptosis. To test this hypothesis we have examined a set of 30 lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from NBS patients for their capacity to enter into apoptosis after a DNA-damaging treatment. There was a substantial 40-fold variation in apoptosis between cell lines from different patients. NBS patient cell lines could be grouped into a large, apoptosis-deficient group and a smaller group with essentially normal apoptotic response to DNA damage. In both groups, cell lines were proficient in TP53 phosphorylation and stabilisation after the same DNA-damaging treatment. Thus the observed variation in apoptosis capacity is not due to failure to activate TP53. Despite the large variation in apoptosis, no statistically significant correlation between apoptotic capacity of patient cell lines and clinical course of the disease was apparent.",M2
17957789,"Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome mutations and risk of breast cancer.Mutations in the NBS1 gene have been identified as disease-causing mutations in patients with Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (<e>NBS</e>), but their clinical impact on breast cancer susceptibility has remained uncertain. We determined the frequency of 2 NBS mutations, 657del5 and R215W, in two large series of breast cancer cases and controls from Northern Germany and from the Republic of Belarus. The 5-bp-deletion 657del5 was identified in 15/1,588 cases (0.9%) from Belarus and in 1/1,076 cases (0.1%) from Germany but in only 1/1,014 population controls from Belarus and 0/1017 German controls (p &lt; 0.01). The missense substitution R215W was observed in 9/1,588 Byelorussian and 9/1,076 German patients (0.6% and 0.8%, respectively) but was also present in 5/1,014 Byelorussian and 2/1,017 German control individuals (adjusted OR = 1.9, 95%CI 0.8-4.6, p = 0.18). Studies of lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed that NBS1/p95 protein levels were reduced to 70% in cells from a heterozygous breast cancer patient carrying R215W and to 15% in cells from a NBS patient compound heterozygous for 657del5/R215W suggesting that the R215W substitution may be associated with protein instability. Levels of radiation-induced phosphorylation of Nbs1/p95(Ser343) were reduced to 60% and 35% of wildtype, respectively. Neither age at diagnosis nor family history of breast cancer differed significantly between carriers and noncarriers of NBS mutations. The combined data are in line with an about 3-fold increase in breast cancer risk for female NBS heterozygotes (OR 3.1; 95%CI 1.4-6.6) and indicate that the 657del5 deletion and perhaps the R215W substitution contribute to inherited breast cancer susceptibility in Central and Eastern Europe.",M2
17919995,"DNA double-strand break and chromosomal rejoining defects with misrejoining in Nijmegen breakage syndrome cells.NBS1-deficient cells exhibit pronounced radiosensitivity and defects in chromosome integrity after ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, yet show only a minor defect in DNA double-strand break (DSB) rejoining, leaving an as yet unresolved enigma as to the nature of the radiosensitivity of these cells. To further investigate the relationship between radiosensitivity, DSB repair, and chromosome stability, we have compared cytological and molecular assays of DSB misrejoining and repair in NBS1-defective, wild type, and NBS1-complemented cells after IR damage. Our findings suggest a subtle defect in overall DSB rejoining in NBS1-defective cells and uniquely also reveal reduced ability of NBS1-defective cells to rejoin correct ends of DSBs. In agreement with published results, one of two different NBS1-defective cell lines showed a slight defect in overall rejoining of DSBs compared to its complemented counterpart, whereas another <e>NBS</e> line did not show any difference from wild type cells. Significant defects in the correct rejoining of DSBs compared to their respective controls were observed for both NBS1-defective lines. The defect in DSB rejoining and the increased misrejoining detected at the molecular level were also reflected in higher levels of fragments and translocations, respectively, at the chromosomal level. This work provides both molecular and cytological evidence that NBS1-deficient cells have defects in DSB processing and reveals that these molecular events can be manifest cytologically.",M2

The immortal T cell lines revealed morphological and other features typical for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

Due to the overlap of clinical and cellular features of patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), NBS was described as an AT variant syndrome until the underlying gene product mutation was identified. Cells from both AT and NBS patients show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), genomic instability and cell cycle checkpoint defects following DNA damage, suggesting that both gene products participate in the same DNA damage response pathway.

17680225,"DNA double-strand break induction and repair in irradiated lymphoblastoid, fibroblast cell lines and white blood cells from ATM, <e>NBS</e> and radiosensitive patients.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), fibroblasts and white blood cells from healthy donors, cancer patients with and without late effects of grade 3-4 (RTOG) as well as donors with known radiosensitivity syndromes were examined with the aim to detect dsb repair ability as a marker for radiosensitivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LCLs from six healthy donors, seven patients with a heterozygous or homozygous genotype for ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), two patients with a late toxicity of grade 3-4 (RTOG), and one cell line with a ligase IV-/- status and its parental cell line were examined. Furthermore, fibroblasts from patients with ATM, NBS, two healthy control individuals, and leukocytes from 16 healthy and 22 cancer patients including seven patients with clinical hypersensitivity grade 3 (RTOG) were examined. Cells were irradiated in vitro with 0-150 Gy. Initial damage as well as remaining damage after 8 and 24 h were measured using constant field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: In contrast to cells derived from patients homozygous for NBS, impaired dsb repair ability could be detected both in fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cells from ATM and ligase IV-/- patients. The dsb repair ability of all 38 leukocyte cell lines (patients with grade 3-4 late effects and controls) was similar, whereas the initial damage among healthy donors was less. CONCLUSION: Despite showing a clinically elevated radiosensitivity after irradiation, the DNA repair of the patients with clinical hypersensitivity grade 3 (RTOG) appeared to be normal. Other mechanisms such as mutations, altered cell cycle or defective apoptosis could play a critical role toward determining radiosensitivity.",M2
17442057,"NBS1, the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene product, regulates neuronal proliferation and differentiation.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by progressive microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and pre-disposition to tumor formation. To investigate the functions of the NBS gene product, NBS1, on neurons, PC12 cells overexpressing NBS1 and related mutants and primary cortical neuronal culture were used in the present study. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was applied to repress the expression of endogenous Nbs1 in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. We demonstrated that overexpression of NBS1 increases cellular proliferation and decreases the apoptosis of PC12 cells in serum withdrawal and ionizing irradiation, through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathway. Overexpression of NBS1 also decreases neurite elongation on PC12 cells under nerve growth factor stimulation. Transfection of NBS1-overexpressing PC12 cells with a dominant negative Akt mutant attenuates the neuroprotection and cellular proliferation effects of NBS1 while having no effect on neurite elongation. PC12 cells overexpressing NBS657del5 and NBS653 mutants, in which the major NBS1 protein in cells are truncated proteins, have decreased cellular proliferation, increased cell death, and decreased neurite elongation compared with those of control PC12 cells. Repression of Nbs1 by siRNA decreases the PI 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation levels, and induces neurite elongation in PC12 cells even without nerve growth factor stimulation. Repression of Nbs1 by siRNA in primary cortical neurons also increased neurite elongation, but increased neuronal death. We conclude that NBS1 can regulate neuronal proliferation and neuroprotection via PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway while regulating neuronal differentiation in a different pathway. Excessive accumulation of truncated protein secondary to 657del5 mutation may be detrimental to neurons, leading to defective neuronal proliferation and differentiation.",M2
17395558,"A case report of a patient with microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, chromosomal radiosensitivity and telomere length alterations closely resembling  Nijmegen breakage syndrome  phenotype.Genetic heterogeneity in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is highlighted by patients showing clinical and cellular features of NBS but with no mutations in NBS1 and normal levels of nibrin. NBS is an autosomal recessive disorder, whose clinical cellular signs include growth and developmental defects, dysmorphic facies, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and radiosensitivity. NBS is caused by mutations in the NBS1 gene, whose product is part of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex involved in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response pathway. Since the identification of the NBS1 gene, patients with NBS clinical signs, particularly severe congenital microcephaly, are screened for mutations in the NBS1 gene. Further analyses include X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations, telomere analysis, kinetics of DSBs repair, levels of a panel of proteins involved in the maintenance of genetic stability, radiation-induced phosphorylation of various substrates and cell cycle analysis. We describe a patient with a NBS clinical phenotype, chromosomal sensitivity to X-rays but without mutations in the whole NBS1 or in the Cernunnos gene. Enhanced response to irradiation was mediated neither by DSBs rejoining defects nor by the NBS/AT-dependent DNA-damage response pathway. Notably, we found that primary fibroblasts from this patient displayed telomere length alterations. Cross-talk between pathways controlling response to DSBs and those involved in maintaining telomeres has been shown in the present patient. Dissecting the cellular phenotype of radiosensitive NBS-like patients represents a useful tool for the research of new genes involved in the cellular response to DSBs.",M2
17219051,"Enhanced CD95-mediated apoptosis contributes to radiation hypersensitivity of <e>NBS</e> lymphoblasts.The molecular causes for enhanced radiosensitivity of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome cells are unclear, especially as repair of DNA damage is hardly impeded in these cells. We clearly demonstrate that radiation hypersensitivity is accompanied by enhanced gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in NBS1 deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines. Differences in the apoptotic behavior of NBS1 (-/-) and NBS1 (+/-) cells are not due to an altered p53 stabilization or phosphorylation in NBS1 (-/-) cells. gamma-radiation-induced caspase-8 activity is increased and visualization of CD95 clustering by laser scanning microscopy shows a significant higher activation of the death receptor in NBS1 (-/-) cells. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms reveals a role for reactive oxygen species-triggered activation of CD95. These results demonstrate that NBS1 suppresses the CD95 death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathway after gamma-irradiation and evidence is given that this is achieved by regulation of the PI3-K/AKT survival pathway.",M2

16877808,"Regional distribution of heterozygous 657del5 mutation carriers of the NBS1 gene in Wielkopolska province (Poland).The homozygous 657del5 mutation, called Slavic mutation, of the NBS1 gene, causes the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (<e>NBS</e>). This syndrome is connected with a high incidence of malignancies in early childhood. A high frequency of NBS heterozygotes was found among patients with melanoma, breast, ovary and prostate cancer. The aim of our research was to determine the frequency of 657del5 mutation of the NBS1 gene in the population of Wielkopolska province. For this purpose, we analysed blood samples from anonymous Guthrie cards. In a group of 2090 newborns from the whole province, we found 16 heterozygous mutation carriers. The frequency of 1/131 is higher than 1/190 reported for populations from other regions in Poland. We observed differential regional distribution of heterozygous 657del5 mutation carriers within the province: among 464 samples from the eastern part of Wielkopolska we found 6 carriers (1/77), in contrast to the southern part without any carrier among 625 samples analysed. The high mean frequency of heterozygous 657del5 mutation (1/131) in Wielkopolska province may be associated with cancer incidence in this region.",M2
16840438,"Cancer incidence in Nijmegen breakage syndrome is modulated by the amount of a variant <e>NBS</e> protein.The human genetic disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), is characterized by radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and an increased risk for cancer, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The NBS1 gene codes for a protein, nibrin, involved in the processing/repair of DNA double-strand breaks and in cell cycle checkpoints. The majority of patients are homozygous for a founder mutation, a 5 bp deletion. This mutation is actually hypomorphic, since a functionally relevant truncated protein, of approximately 70 kDa, is produced by alternative translation. Null mutation of the homologous gene in mice is lethal; however, null-mutant murine cells can be rescued by a human NBS1 cDNA carrying the founder mutation. Clearly, the truncated p70-nibrin is able to sustain vital cellular functions of the full-length protein. We have used semi-quantitative immunoprecipitation to examine a panel of 26 lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from NBS patients for their level of p70-nibrin expression and correlate this with details of clinical phenotype provided by the two contributing centres. We find considerable variation in the amount of p70-nibrin in cell lines from different patients. Examination of clinical history indicated a clear and statistically significant correlation between p70-nibrin expression levels and lymphoma incidence. The variation in p70-nibrin levels between patients probably reflects the susceptibility of the alternative translation process to other genetic and non-genetic factors. Patients whose cells are able to maintain particularly high levels of the truncated p70-nibrin protein are at a lower risk for lymphoma than those patients with low levels of p70-nibrin in their cells.",M2
16809669,"Heterozygous carriers of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome have a distinct gene expression phenotype.Autosomal recessive diseases are those that require mutations in both alleles to exhibit the disorder. Although most recessive conditions are rare, heterozygous carriers of recessive mutations are quite common. In this study, we show that carriers of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) have a distinct gene expression phenotype that differs from that of noncarriers and also from that of carriers of a similar syndrome, Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT). We found 520 genes whose expression levels differ significantly (P &lt; or = 0.001) between NBS carriers and controls. By linear discriminant analysis, we found a combination of 16 genes that allows 100% correct classification of individuals as either NBS carriers or noncarriers in a training set with 25 individuals, and in a test set with 52 individuals. When applied to AT carriers, the discriminant function misclassified only one out of 18 AT carriers as an NBS carrier. Our result shows that NBS carriers have a specific gene expression phenotype. It suggests that heterozygous mutations can contribute significantly to natural variation in gene expression. This has implications for the role that heterozygosity for recessive diseases plays in the overall genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases.",M2
16765653,"Impaired elimination of DNA double-strand break-containing lymphocytes in ataxia telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome.The repair of DNA double-strand breaks is critical for genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here we show that following treatment with the DNA-intercalating agent actinomycin D (ActD), normal quiescent T cells accumulate double-strand breaks and die, whereas T cells from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) patients are resistant to this death pathway despite a comparable amount of DNA damage. We demonstrate that the ActD-induced death pathway in quiescent T lymphocytes follows DNA damage and H2AX phosphorylation, is ATM- and NBS1-dependent and due to p53-mediated cellular apoptosis. In response to genotoxic 2-Gy gamma-irradiation, on the other hand, quiescent T cells from normal donors survive following complete resolution of the damage thus induced. T cells from AT and NBS patients also survive, but retain foci of phosphorylated H2AX due to a subtle double-strand break (DSB) repair defect. A common consequence of these two genetic defects in the DSB response is the apparent tolerance of cells containing DNA breaks. We suggest that this tolerance makes a major contribution to the oncogenic risk of patients with chromosome instability syndromes.",M2
16544999,"Screening of Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 mutations in four unrelated families by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a marked predisposition to lymphoreticular malignancies. The rarity of the disease and the presence, in several cases, of a mild clinical phenotype make diagnosis difficult. The underlying gene, NBS1, consists of 16 exons and encodes nibrin, a member of the hMRE11/hRAD50/hNBS1 protein complex. In addition to the  Slavic mutation,  657del5, identified in more than 100 patients with NBS, 9 other mutations have been found in families of different ethnic origin. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to rapidly detect the private mutations, 742insGG and 835del4, in exon 7 and the 900del25 mutation in exon 8 of the NBS1 gene. In particular, we designed NBS1-specific primers for wild-type and mutated alleles, and optimized a specific PCR protocol for each mutation. We used this method to analyze 4 unrelated NBS families, 3 from Italy and 1 from Morocco. We believe it could be a useful tool for: (1) confirming the NBS diagnosis in the presence of clinical signs of the disease; (2) identifying NBS heterozygotes and performing prenatal diagnosis in families with affected members; and (3) screening selected populations in which the frequency of NBS might be higher because of a founder effect.",M2
16470524,"Radiation-induced DNA damage and repair in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients and carriers assessed by the Comet assay.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) patients and carriers are predisposed to malignancy and are often treated with X-irradiation. In the present study, the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay was used to examine radiation-induced DNA damage and repair in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from NBS patients (n=13) and carriers (n=36) of six unrelated families. Cells from apparently healthy donors (n=10) and from breast cancer patients with normal clinical radiosensitivity (n=10) served as controls. Cells were irradiated with 5 Gy of X-rays and assayed for initial DNA damage and for residual DNA damage after 40 min of repair; the kinetics of DNA repair also was estimated. In addition, the nuclear area of unirradiated cells was extracted from the Comet data. The initial radiation-induced DNA fragmentation indicated that cells from members of two out of six NBS families were significantly more sensitive to X-irradiation than cells from the controls. Cells from four NBS families had longer DNA repair half-time values, while cells from five NBS families had significantly increased residual DNA damage following repair. The mean nuclear area of unirradiated cells processed in the Comet assay was 1.3-fold higher in cells from all NBS families than in the controls (P&lt;0.05). Notably, the Comet assay parameters (initial and residual DNA damage and the repair kinetics) of irradiated NBS cells predicted the carrier status of the majority (86%) of blindly tested individuals. The prediction of NBS status was higher if the nuclear area of unirradiated cells was used as the endpoint. The results of this study suggest that the impaired radiation response of NBS cells should be taken into account if radiotherapy of NBS patients and carriers is required.",M2

16188882,"Importin KPNA2 is required for proper nuclear localization and multiple functions of NBS1.Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) is a chromosomal-instability syndrome associated with cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, microcephaly, and growth retardation. The NBS gene product, NBS1, is a component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, a central player associated with double strand break (DSB) repair. In response to radiation, NBS1 is phosphorylated by ATM, and the MRN complex relocalizes to form punctate nuclear foci for DNA repair. NBS1 controls both the nuclear localization of the MRN complexes and radiation-induced focus formation. We report here that the KPNA2 (importin alpha1) is important for the normal nuclear localization of the MRN complex and its proper formation of the nuclear foci. KPNA2 is the only member of the importin alpha family that physically interacts with NBS1, and the KPNA2-mediated nucleus localization sequence (NLS) is mapped to amino acid residues 461-467 of NBS1 that is sufficient for both the interaction with KPNA2 and the proper nuclear localization. Inhibition of KPNA2 or blockage of the KPNA2 interaction with NBS1 results in a reduction of radiation-induced nuclear focus accumulation, DSB repair, and cell cycle checkpoint signaling of NBS1. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that an interaction with KPNA2 contributes to nuclear localization and multiple tumor suppression functions of the NBS1 complex.",M2
16033915,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) with neurological abnormalities and without chromosomal instability.BACKGROUND: Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder with hypersensitivity to ionising radiation. The clinical phenotype is characterised by congenital microcephaly, mild dysmorphic facial appearance, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and greatly increased risk for lymphoreticular malignancy. Most NBS patients are of Slavic origin and homozygous for the founder mutation 657del5. The frequency of 657del5 heterozygotes in the Czech population is 1:150. Recently, another NBS1 mutation, 643C&gt;T(R215W), with uncertain pathogenicity was found to have higher frequency among tumour patients of Slavic origin than in controls. This alteration results in the substitution of the basic amino acid arginine with the non-polar tryptophan and thus could potentially interfere with the function of the NBS1 protein, nibrin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Children with congenital microcephaly are routinely tested for the 657del5 mutation in the Czech and Slovak Republics. Here, we describe for the first time a severe form of NBS without chromosomal instability in monozygotic twin brothers with profound congenital microcephaly and developmental delay who are compound heterozygotes for the 657del5 and 643C&gt;T(R215W) NBS1 mutations. Both children showed reduced expression of full length nibrin when compared with a control and a heterozygote for the 657del5 mutation. Radiation response processes such as phosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation/stabilisation of p53, which are promoted by NBS1, are strongly reduced in cells from these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, the patients are more severely affected than classical NBS patients. Consequently, we postulate that homozygosity for the 643C&gt;T(R215W) mutation will also lead to a, possibly very, severe disease phenotype.",M2
15920752,"Altered centrosomes in ataxia-telangiectasia cells and rapamycin-treated Chinese hamster cells.Rapamycin induces chromosome malsegregation in mammalian cell lines and yeast. Previous studies indicate that the function impaired in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients is necessary for both the growth inhibition and the chromosome malsegregation induced by rapamycin, and that treating the non-tumorigenic Chinese hamster cell line CHEF/18 with rapamycin results in supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar spindles. In this paper we report that lymphoblastoid cell lines established from A-T patients as well as hamster A-T-like cells are more resistant to rapamycin than the respective normal cell lines. Two cell lines derived from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (<e>NBS</e>) patients, who have clinical symptoms similar to those of A-T but a different molecular defect, were not resistant to rapamycin. Both A-T lymphoblastoid cells and A-T-like fibroblasts had giant centrosomes formed by more than two areas of gamma-tubulin-reacting material. Such giant centrosomes were also observed in CHEF/18 cells after prolonged treatment with rapamycin. Formation of giant centrosomes, possibly due to the coalescence of supernumerary centrosomes, was associated with increased aneuploidy in treated cells. Expression analysis of cell-cycle regulatory genes in rapamycin-treated human lymphoblastoid cells indicated that rapamycin decreased the expression of the tumor suppressor gene GADD45. The levels of RB, p21 and p53 mRNA were also decreased, although to a lesser extent. As rapamycin is often used as an immunosuppressant in pediatric transplant patients, these data indicate that caution should be taken, especially when the drug is given for prolonged periods of time.",M2

The use of standard chemotherapy in our patient, except for cranial irradiation, led to complete and sustained remission of TLBL/ALL. In patients with chromosomal instability syndromes chemotherapy must be modified and radiotherapy must be omitted because of potentially serious toxic complications. Careful prevention of infections, including the use of intravenous immunoglobulin is also essential for successful treatment of lymphoid malignancies in NBS. Immunodeficiency in NBS is profound affecting both humoral and cellular immune system.
