18481669,"Teaching inference in personality test interpretation: verbal abstract reasoning and the <e>TAT</e>.Instructors of personality assessment are challenged with teaching students how to execute the tacit thinking skills necessary to make sound test interpretations. The author provides a concrete tool for teaching students how to make interpretive inferences from verbal personality test data utilizing the construct of verbal abstract reasoning. Applied specifically to Thematic Apperception Test interpretation, the author discusses how the construct of verbal abstract reasoning can be utilized: as a model for providing explicit instruction on the implicit process of drawing inferences in test interpretation; for grounding students in data when constructing interpretations and avoiding making overpersonalized interpretations; as a means of basing interpretations on a convergence of data; as a means of gauging the level of confidence one can place in interpretations; and for understanding inferences drawn from other tests, such as the Rorschach.",M1
17214589,"Longitudinal study of defense mechanisms: late childhood to late adolescence.Based on longitudinal data from the Institute of Human Development Intergenerational Study, the use and change in defense mechanisms of more than 150 individuals, as assessed from <e>TAT</e> stories, was studied across ages 11, 12, and 18. The findings of this study, based on an earlier generation, were generally consistent with cross-sectional findings from current samples, showing that the defenses of projection and identification were used more frequently than denial at all three ages and that the use of projection and identification increased from early to late adolescence. However, unlike current findings, the 18-year-olds did not show greater use of identification than of projection, perhaps due to IQ differences between this community sample and the samples of more recent studies.",M1
16837057,"Processing of autobiographical memory retrieval cues in borderline personality disorder.BACKGROUND: Affective dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD) in response to both external stimuli and memories has been shown to be associated with functional alterations of limbic and prefrontal brain areas. This study aimed to examine neuronal networks involved in autobiographical memory retrieval using standardized stimuli that gain autobiographical significance by illustrating marked solitary and social situations of human life. METHODS: Using event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we examined the processing of pictures from the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) in 14 BPD patients and 14 controls. RESULTS: In both groups, TAT stimuli activated brain areas known to be involved in autobiographical memory retrieval. BPD subjects lacked differential amygdala, orbitofrontal and cingulate activations for TAT versus neutral stimuli. In the TAT condition, compared to controls, BPD subjects displayed increased BOLD responses in the bilateral orbitofrontal and insular regions, in the left anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as in the parietal and parahippocampal areas, consistent with a more aversive and arousing experience assessed by self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BOLD responses during TAT processing in BPD subjects were in line with previously reported changes in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, which are known to be involved in memory retrieval. However, BPD subjects displayed hyperactivation in these areas for both TAT and neutral stimuli. The deficit of selective activation of areas involved in autobiographical memory retrieval suggests a general tendency towards a self-referential mode of information processing in BPD, or a failure to switch between emotionally salient and neutral stimuli.",M1
16719985,"Dependent personality traits and information processing: assessing the interpretation of ambiguous information using the Thematic Apperception Test.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate interpretation bias in people with dependent personality traits. METHOD: Eight Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) cards were administered to participants (N=56) who scored high or low on DSM-III-R dependent personality pathology. Two independent judges rated the TAT stories using a rating list based on the cognitive model of the dependent and paranoid personality disorder. RESULTS: Controlling for self-esteem, the dependent interpretation bias appeared to be specific for dependent personality pathology. SEM analysis supported a mediation model in which beliefs mediate the relationship between DSM-III-R traits and interpretation bias. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study support the hypothesis that people with dependent traits are characterized by a schema-related interpretation bias and that this bias is mediated by dependent beliefs.",M1
16529585,"Motive congruence and interpersonal identity status.This article examines the relationship between interpersonal ego identity formation and congruence of self-attributed and implicit affiliation motives. A <e>TAT</e>-type picture-story test, the Personality Research Form, and the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status were administered to 177 participants to assess data on affiliation motivation and interpersonal identity formation. According to a scoring system developed by Winter, the picture stories were coded for need for Affiliation. Analyses revealed that motive congruence is significantly associated with participants' level of identity achievement and identity foreclosure in the interpersonal domain. Such a relationship could not be identified for identity diffusion and moratorium.",M1
16370791,"Defense mechanisms and self-reported violence toward strangers.College men who reported committing violence toward strangers (N = 30) and nonviolent college men (N = 30) completed Thematic Apperception Test cards (<e>TAT</e>) and responded to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). Defense mechanisms were coded from the TAT responses with the Defense Mechanism Manual (DMM). The men who reported violence toward strangers had higher DMM Denial scores and higher MMPI-2 Antisocial Practices scores than the nonviolent men. Student violence toward strangers seems to reflect immaturity rather than psychopathy.",M1
15666912,"Obsessiveness and a thematic apperception test-based measure of aggression.Freud (1909/1955) hypothesized a conflict between love and hate in obsessive neurosis. To test this relationship, we compared a Thematic Apperception Test-based measure of aggressive fantasies in college men who scored either high or low on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised. 64 undergraduate men from beginning classes in psychology participated. Their mean age was 19.4 yr. (SD= 1.7). 16 men with high scores had significantly higher scores on a <e>TAT</e>-based measure of aggressive fantasies toward parents, partners, and others than 15 men with low scores, which is consistent with Freud's hypothesis.",M1
12946920,"Origin and history of the  Series B  and  Series C  <e>TAT</e> pictures.I present the origin and history of the  Series B  and  Series C  pictures of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT; White, Sanford, Murray, &amp; Bellak, 1941; Clark, 1944). I fill in the evolutionary gap between the  Series A  pictures (W. G. Morgan, 2002) and the 1943  Series D  (W. G. Morgan, 1995, 1999). Here one can observe which cards were retained from series to series, what new cards were experimentally introduced, and which cards were resurrected after a period of disuse. It would seem that only the world shattering events of WWII were enough to halt this evolution and freeze the content of the TAT at the time of Murray's departure from the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services.",M1
12511014,"Origin and history of the earliest Thematic Apperception Test pictures.I present the origin and history of the  Series A  pictures of the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>; Murray, 1943/1971). The TAT and its pictures evolved during the 1930s and early 1940s. The Series A pictures were probably never a distinct, fixed set of cards as the name seems to imply. The pictures used were in a constant state of flux with additions, deletions, and modifications common. In this article I describe the origins of the test and catalog its earliest pictures. It is hoped that familiarity with the test's development will increase appreciation for the efforts of the test's originators and add perspective and depth to one's awareness of the stimuli used.",M1
11781029,"Internal consistency of the object relations and social cognition scales for the Thematic Apperception Test.We examined 8 data sets to determine whether it is possible to attain acceptable levels of internal consistency (coefficient alpha) reliability for the 4 Object Relations and Social Cognition scales (ORSC; Westen, Lohr, Silk, Kerber, &amp; Goodrich, 1989) for the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>; Murray, 1943) when cards are considered as items in a scale. Number of cards used in the data sets ranged from 4 to 10, and the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula was applied to estimate the number of cards that would be required to attain alpha levels of different magnitudes. The two more structural subscales (Complexity of Representations and Understanding of Social Causality) have somewhat higher consistencies than the two more affective ones (Affect Tone and Capacity for Emotional Investment and Moral Standards). The results suggest that the use of 10 to 12 cards provides internal consistencies of alpha &gt; or = .70 across each of the 4 ORSC scales.",M1
11693860,"Convergent validity of Rorschach and <e>TAT</e> scales of object relations.The Rorschach Mutuality of Autonomy Scale (MOA) and the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS) have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of interpersonal functioning. Utilizing a sample of 57 outpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Axis II diagnosis, this study extends the findings of previous research demonstrating the reliability and convergent validity of each measure. Analyses focused on the convergent validity between the Rorschach MOA Scale and 8 SCORS variables (complexity, affect, emotional investment in relationships, emotional investment in values and morals, understanding of social causality, management of impulses/aggression, self-esteem, identity/coherence of self) ratings of Thematic Apperception Test narratives. The conceptual nature and clinical utility of these findings are discussed in relation to psychological assessment.",M1
11562106,"Object relations and defense mechanisms of a psychopathic serial sexual homicide perpetrator: a <e>TAT</e> analysis.The case of a 24-year-old African American man who committed serial sexual homicide and who met criteria (Hare, 1991) for psychopathy is presented. His Thematic Apperception Test (Murray, 1943) responses were used to code key aspects of personality organization--object relations and defense mechanisms--via the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (Westen, Lohr, Silk, &amp; Kerber, 1989) and the Defense Mechanisms Manual (Cramer, 1991), respectively. Severe object relations pathology and a reliance on the defense mechanism of immature projection and immature denial are noted. Findings are relatively consistent with previous psychodynamic Rorschach studies of psychopathic sexual homicide perpetrators (Gacono, Meloy, &amp; Bridges, 2000; Meloy, Gacono, &amp; Kenney, 1994).",M1
11562105,"Assessment of implicit motives with a research version of the <e>TAT</e>: picture profiles, gender differences, and relations to other personality measures.Four hundred twenty-eight participants wrote imaginative stories in response to 6 picture cues of a research version of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT; Morgan &amp; Murray, 1935). Story protocols were coded for n (need) Power, n Achievement, and n Affiliation using Winter's (1991) integrated scoring system that provided detailed information about the motive profiles of individual picture cues. In general, picture cues differed strongly from each other with regard to how many scorable instances of power, achievement, or affiliation imagery they elicited. The n Affiliation, but not n Power, n Achievement, or activity inhibition--a measure of impulse control--was found to be higher in (a) women than in men and (b) individuals tested in a group than in individuals tested individually. TAT motive measures showed no significant overlap with questionnaire measures of motivational orientation (German Personality Research Form; Stumpf, Angleitner, Wieck, Jackson, &amp; Beloch-Till, 1985) or traits (German NEO-Five-Factor Inventory; Borkenau &amp; Ostendorf, 1993).",M1
11562098,"Sociotropy and autonomy: preliminary evidence for construct validity using <e>TAT</e> narratives.In this investigation, we evaluated the construct validity of sociotropy and autonomy as assessed by the revised Personal Style Inventory (PSI; Robins et al., 1994). Stories given to 6 cards of the Thematic Apperception Test (Murray, 1943) were coded for need for Achievement (McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, &amp; Lowell, 1953) and need for Affiliation (Heyns, Veroff, &amp; Atkinson, 1958). These scores were correlated with PSI Sociotropy and Autonomy, along with their component subscales. The construct validity of Sociotropy, Autonomy, and 5 of 6 component subscales were supported as hypoth sized. Consistent with past research, there was no support for the construct validity of the Perfectionism/Self-Criticism subscale of Autonomy. In addition, separate analyses by gender suggested that the construct validity of sociotropy may be greater for women than for men. The results represent an important finding in that nonquestionnaire measures of interpersonal and achievement-related concerns were found to support the validity of the PSI, a need identified by the questionnaire's authors.",M1
11520468,"Interest and limitations of projective techniques in the assessment of personality disorders.Assessing personality disorders (PD) remains a difficult task because of persistent problems linked to concurrent validity of existing instruments, which are all structured interviews or self-report inventories. It has been advocated that indirect methods, projective techniques in particular, can strengthen PD assessment methods. The thematic apperception test (<e>TAT</e>) may be a significant adjuvant method of PD assessment.",M1
11407145,"How was this story told in the mother tongue? An integrative perspective.Most of the psychoanalytic literature on the mother tongue has focused on the clinical therapeutic encounter. The authors applied findings from therapy research using the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) to tease out differences and similarities in how stories are told in the mother tongue versus the acquired language. This projective test provides a rich medium to explore the individual's inner world, fantasies, thoughts, wishes, sense of self, and self-in-relation-to-other via a narrative that is spontaneously produced in response to standardized stimuli. The TAT was administered to four participants in both the mother tongue and the acquired language. The narratives were then analyzed using two different rating systems. Differences in sense of self, self-in-relation-to-other, and level of pathology were identified using one participant's narratives. Although no global generalizations can be made from one study, the authors suggest that people tell their story differently when speaking in the mother tongue versus the acquired language.",M1
11406799,"The responses of dissociative patients on the thematic apperception test.This study compared the responses of dissociative inpatients and general inpatient psychiatric controls on the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>; Murray, 1943). We found the stories of dissociative participants to be characterized by a greater interpersonal distance and more trauma and dissociation responses than those of the controls. No significant differences were found regarding total number of emotional references, although references to positive emotions were almost nonexistent for the dissociative group. A post hoc analysis of the data found the testing behaviors of dissociative participants to be characterized by switching, trance states, intrainterview amnesias, and affectively loaded card rejections. Questions were raised regarding the relevancy of the findings to clinical practice and how they might explain some of the controversies surrounding the diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (DID).",M1
11339801,"Defense use and defense understanding in children.This study investigated the relation between children's use of defense mechanisms and their understanding of those defenses. We hypothesized that, once a child understands how a particular defense functions, the use of that defense will no longer be successful and will be replaced by another defense mechanism that is not yet understood. Defense use was assessed from the Thematic Appreception Test (<e>TAT</e>) stories told by 122 children; defense understanding was determined from the children's understanding of stories portraying defenses. The results indicated that younger children (mean age = 7-8) used the defense of denial more than the older children (mean age = 9-11). Older children understood the functioning of denial and projection better than the younger children. A comparison of children who did and did not understand a defense showed that younger children who understood the functioning of denial were less likely to themselves use denial. Likewise, older children who understood the functioning of projection were less likely to use this defense.",M1

Thematic Apperception Test.Thematic Apperception Test (Murray, 1943) responses of 69 Asian American (hereafter, Asian) and 83 White students were coded for defenses according to the Defense Mechanism Manual (Cramer, 1991b) and studied for differential validity in predicting paper-and-pencil measures of relevant constructs. Three tests for differential validity were used: (a) differences between validity coefficients, (b) interactions between predictor and ethnicity in criterion prediction, and (c) differences between groups in mean prediction errors using a common regression equation. Modest differential validity was found. It was surprising that the DMM scales were slightly stronger predictors of their criteria among Asians than among Whites and when a common predictor was used, desirable criteria were overpredicted for Asians, whereas undesirable ones were overpredicted for Whites. The results were not affected by acculturation level or English vocabulary among the Asians.",M1

10713901,"The use of the thematic apperception test in the study of Native American psychological characteristics: a review and archival study of Navaho men.The present study was designed as a  snapshot in time --an archival analysis of the psychological characteristics of four Navaho men taken from Navaho Veterans--A Study of Changing Values (E. Z. Vogt, 1951). From a sample of 15 men, Vogt judged 2 as  most acculturated  and 2 as  most unacculturated.  The present study was an attempt to examine the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) protocols of these men on the basis of any recurring and psychologically significant thematic patterns, shared and unshared by the  acculturated  and  unacculturated  subjects. Vogt administered cards from the original TAT set created by H. A. Murray (1943). In this article, a section concerning the definitional use of the term acculturation is provided, followed by a discussion of the limitations inherent in the analysis of TAT protocols. A general survey of psychological and cultural studies of Native Americans using the TAT or TAT modifications is also provided. The examination of the protocol sets resulted in the identification of four themes or approaches to the TAT cards that were thought to be most pervasive and significant across both levels of acculturation: economic deprivation and physical suffering, loneliness/isolation, interpersonal conflict/violence, and individualistic vs. familial orientations. These themes and approaches are illustrated with quotations from the original protocols and are later summarized as the first four categories of a table comparing the psychological characteristics of the most acculturated men with the most unacculturated men. Results of the thematic analyses are discussed within the framework of economic and social pressures traditionally experienced by Native Americans.",M1
10689653,"Use of the <e>TAT</e> in the assessment of DSM-IV cluster B personality disorders.The Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS), developed by Western, Lohr, Silk, Kerber, and Goodrich (1985), is a diagnostic instrument used to assess an array of psychological functioning by using clinical narratives such as the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT; Murray, 1943) stories. This study investigated the utility of the SCORS to differentiate between Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM-IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) antisocial personality disorder (ANPD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), and Cluster C personality disorder (CPD). A sample of 58 patients was separated into four groups: ANPD (n = 9), BPD (n = 21; 18 with a primary BPD diagnosis and 3 with prominent borderline traits who met 4 of the 5 DSM-IV criteria necessary for a BPD diagnosis), NPD (n = 16; 8 with a primary NPD diagnosis and 8 with prominent narcissistic traits who met 4 of the 5 DSM-IV criteria necessary for a NPD diagnosis), and CPD (n = 12). These groups were then compared on the 8 SCORS variables by using 5 TAT cards (1, 2, 3BM, 4, and 13MF). Spearman-Brown correction for 2-way mixed effects model of reliability for the 8 SCORS variables ranged from .70 to .95. The results of categorical and dimensional analyses indicate that (a) SCORS variables can be used to differentiate ANPD, BPD, and NPD; (b) the BPD group scored significantly lower (greater maladjustment) than did the CPD group on certain variables; (c) the BPD group scored significantly lower (greater maladjustment) than did the NPD group on all 8 SCORS variables; (d) the ANPD group scored significantly lower than did the NPD group on certain variables; (e) certain variables were found to be empirically related to the total number of DSM-IV ANPD, BPD, and NPD criteria; and (f) certain variables were found to be empirically related to Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, &amp; Kaemmer, 1989) Personality disorder scales. The results of this study are discussed in terms of clinical utility, conceptual, and theoretical implications.",M1

9700791,"Measures of aggression in questionnaire ratings and stories from the Apperceptive Personality Test.The present study investigated relationships between judges' ratings of hostility from the content of eight <e>TAT</e>-like stories and scores on Hostile Feelings and Hostile Actions scales of the Apperceptive Personality Test. This test was administered to 104 college students volunteers (53 women, 51 men), who received extra credit on examination scores for their participation. Each subject made up 8 stories to stimulus pictures and then filled out 8 objectively scorable questionnaires about their stories from the Apperceptive Personality Test. The stories were rated by two  blind  judges for hostile feelings and hostile activities using Fine's 1955 scoring criteria. Agreement of judges ranged from .47 to .80. Correlations of judge's ratings with Apperceptive Personality Test scores were .13 for Hostile Feelings and .41 (df = 102, p &lt; .01) for Hostile Actions. Thus questionnaires scores for Hostile Feelings are unrelated and scores for Hostile Actions only moderately related to judge's ratings of story content.",M1
9577238,"Traits and motives: toward an integration of two traditions in personality research.After reviewing classic and current conceptions of trait (as measured by questionnaires) and motive (as measured by the Thematic Apperception Test [<e>TAT</e>] or other imaginative verbal behavior), the authors suggest that these 2 concepts reflect 2 fundamentally different elements of personality--conceptually distinct and empirically unrelated. The authors propose that traits and motives interact in the prediction of behavior: Traits channel the behavioral expression of motives throughout the life course. The authors illustrate this interactive hypothesis in 2 longitudinal studies, focusing on the broad trait of extraversion and the 2 social motives of affiliation and power. In interaction with extraversion, both motives show predicted and replicated relations to independently measured life outcomes in the domains of relationships and careers. Extraversion facilitates unconflicted motive expression, whereas introversion deflects social motives away from their characteristic goals and creates difficulties in goal attainment.",M1

A sample of 34 schizophrenic patients (14 male and 20 female) were studied. Stories told in response to six <e>TAT</e> cards were scored for Intimacy Motivation (IM). Levels of Premorbid adjustment (PA) and Asociality (ASOC) were assessed. A statistically significant interaction between gender and level of PA indicated that males with good PA had higher IM than those with poorer whereas females with good PA had lower IM than females with poor PA. The same interaction was obtained for the measure of ASOC. Findings are discussed in relation to sociocultural expectations for women. Some implications for differential treatment needs of male and female schizophrenics are suggested.",M1
10179832,"<e>TAT</e> results in a longitudinal study of bereaved college students.The authors analyzed projective data obtained from 141 college students who wrote stories on three separate occasions to selected cards from the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).  The students included 46 members of support groups for bereaved college students, 34 members of a bereavement control group, and 61 nonbereaved students.  The study used a repeated-measures pretest-posttest control group design to gather longitudinal data about the trajectory of bereavement with and without support group intervention.  Coders, who reached consistently high interrater reliability, looked for themes of death, grief, coping, and affiliation in the stories.  Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and repeated-measures MANOVA tests were applied to analyze coding results.  Overall MANOVA results indicated significant group differences in the responses to the TAT cards.  Repeated-measures MANOVA found group differences in use of themes of death and grief and found Group x Time differences in maintaining a sense of self-efficacy while in a crisis.  A majority of the stories contained affiliation imagery but without any group differences in the use of such imagery.",M1
9111852,"Parental communication deviance: its stability and the effect of family treatment in recent-onset schizophrenia.The influence of a behavioural family treatment on parental communication deviance (CD) was investigated in a longitudinal treatment study. Subjects were the parents of young patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or related disorders. Parents and patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: individual out-patient treatment or a combination of individual out-patient and family treatment. Parental CD was assessed with the Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) both at the start of the out-patient treatment and after completion of treatment 1 year later. Most families had high levels of CD, a finding which is in agreement with previous CD studies. These high CD levels remained stable over the 12-month period. Family treatment was not effective in influencing the level of CD. The findings suggest that high CD is a stable trait-marker of parents, and they support the notion that high levels of CD may precede the onset of serious psychotic disorders. Studies with more chronic patients are needed to replicate the findings.",M1

The consistency of these findings, despite sampling and other methodological differences, highlights the applicability of object relations theory to the study of abuse sequelae. This article illustrates the use of the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scales (SCORS) in the clinical assessment of maltreated children by applying it to selected Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) stories of a sexually abused girl, a physically abused girl, and a distressed but nonabused peer.

Results revealed significant differences in overall object relations between the abused and nonabused children both on mean scores, reflecting lower levels of typical functioning, and on frequency of Level 1 scores, indicating a propensity for more grossly pathological functioning. Further comparisons between sexual and physical abuse victims revealed differential impairments in the capacity to invest in relationships and moral standards.

7798082,"Alexithymia and physiological reactivity to emotion-provoking visual scenes.Alexithymia, a syndrome that involves a marked inability to name feelings, has been linked to psychosomatic illness. This study addressed the question of whether alexithymic tendencies are related to heightened levels of autonomic response to extrinsic cues. Alexithymia was assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and by the emotional content of stories written to five <e>TAT</e>-like printed pictures. Seventy-two college students were exposed to a series of emotion-provoking slides while their heart rates and electrodermal responses were recorded. Results indicated a trend for alexithymic tendencies to be associated with less heart rate increase and fewer electrodermal responses while viewing the slides. Alexithymia was also associated with a small but significant elevation in baseline heart rate. These findings are discussed as part of a pattern of results which calls into question the hypothesis that alexithymia is related to illness because it produces hyperarousal to situational stressors; it is suggested that future research on the relationship between alexithymia and health status should be broadened to explore health-maintenance behaviors and other possible mechanisms.",M1

As predicted, a history of physical abuse was associated with a more malevolent object world; a lower level capacity for emotional investment in relations and moral standards; and less accurate, complex, and logical attributions of causality in understanding human interaction. These impairments in object relations were manifest both as a typical level of functioning and as a propensity for more grossly pathological functioning.

8189339,"The Thematic Apperception Test and Alzheimer's disease.The Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>; Murray, 1938, 1943) is widely used in personality description and psychological assessment. Similar narrative tasks are also frequently used as part of neuropsychological assessment. Little is empirically known, however, concerning performances of cognitively impaired individuals on thematic tasks when compared with other diagnostic groups. It was predicted that hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) would demonstrate impaired performances on the TAT when compared with a group of nondemented psychiatric inpatients. This prediction was supported, with the DAT group performing significantly worse on TAT dependent measures than the nondemented group. Results indicate total number of words and mean number of words used, loss of instructional set, and tendencies to describe the pictures to be significantly different between groups. These findings are discussed in terms of neuropsychological theory on verbal expression and in terms of use of the TAT as a screening device for clinicians in determining need for neuropsychological evaluation.",M1

In the present study the effects of long-term motor inhibition on movement perception and fantasy level were explored in 19 physically handicapped children, ages 11 to 15 years. Analysis showed that the physically handicapped children produced more (both human and animal) movement responses than the 19 normal children. Fantasy in the TAT was also higher in the former group. The theoretical basis of projective movement responses and fantasy in physical handicap needs more clarification. A more detailed approach in qualitative analysis of the movement responses is also important.",M1

The 1960 Hafner and Kaplan TAT and Rorschach hostility indices were related to the 1977 Luukkonen indices (aggression-inward, aggression-outward, fantasy-aggression, oral, anal and phallic content), to the Pruitt and Spilka empathy index, and to the Neiger reality index. The TAT hostility index for boys was significantly higher than that for girls; boys expressed more physical and girls more verbal hostility in TAT stories. On the Rorschach, aggression outward and inward correlated significantly with Rorschach hostility, phallic and oral themes.",M1

Responses to a set of <e>TAT</e> cards.In Part I of this investigation (Oz, Tari, &amp; Fine, 1992), it was found that, in comparison with nonmother peers, teenage mothers demonstrated a higher degree of ego development. This was in contradiction to most of the literature on the subject. In the second part of the study, the Thematic Apperception Test was employed to examine defenses and motivations which may impact upon the young girls' functioning within family and heterosexual relationships. Results confirmed reports in the literature which have indicated that adolescent mothers attempt to resolve autonomy-dependence conflicts in heterosexual relationships, whereas nonmothers do so within the family of origin. Consistent with their enhanced ego maturity, teenage mothers were more likely to confront their conflicts than were nonmothers. However, whereas nonmothers reacted to environmental stressors by rejecting the source of the stress, teenage mothers tended to react with self-abasement. It is recommended that further research be directed toward uncovering the emotional and cognitive resources of teenage mothers rather than focusing on their more obvious weaknesses.",M1
1533943,"The Thematic Apperception Test as an aid in understanding the psychodynamics of development of chronic idiopathic pain syndrome.41 chronically ill low-back pain patients (27 women, 14 men) with a long history of work disablement (median = 2 years and 8 months) were submitted to thematic apperception testing (<e>TAT</e>). The tape-recorded protocols were evaluated by 2 independent, experienced clinicians well acquainted with the TAT, as well as with psychoanalytic theory and technique. The 2 evaluators judged almost all the patients as depressive, alexithymic, passive and antiaggressive with clear tendencies to reaction formation towards underlying aggressivity. Many patients were further judged as guilt-ridden with an unresolved oedipal conflict, while others had a deep oral problem with suicidal tendencies. Two of the patients were judged by both evaluators as having psychotic or prepsychotic traits. Overall interrater reliability was very high, with a correlation for the different categories between 0.50 and 0.76 (median 0.72 and p value never below 0.005). Our results indicate that one of the main characteristics of low-back pain patients is the denial of aggression. Other main features of our patients were depressivity, passivity and oral or oedipal conflicts, alexithymia and lack of internal locus of control. Also we find the TAT as a very suitable test for achieving the understanding of the complexity of the problem of pain.",M1

2373216,"Can communication deviance be measured in a family problem-solving interaction?Communication deviance (CD) refers to confusing and fragmented communication that prevents family members from attaining a shared focus of attention and meaning. Levels of communication deviance based on individual parental projective test protocols--Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) and Rorschach--have repeatedly been found to be higher in parents of schizophrenic offspring than in parents of normal or nonpsychotic offspring. CD has also been measured in family transactions in which parents and their offspring interact with one another around a projective test stimulus, the Consensus Rorschach. There have been relatively few attempts to measure specific CD codes in familial interaction that is not initiated around an ambiguous visual stimulus. The present article examines the reliability and construct validity of an interactional measure (ICD) obtained from family transactions in which parents and patients are working toward the solution of a salient family problem. ICD from this family problem-solving task was compared to more traditional measures of CD from parental TAT protocols in a sample of 59 parents of 37 recent-onset schizophrenic patients. Results indicated that CD could be reliably measured in an interactive setting not initiated around a projective test stimulus, and provided evidence for the construct validity of ICD.",M1

It was argued that increased emphasis on formal aspects of TAT responses is warranted, because these characteristics can be determined more objectively and are more suitable for direct group comparison. Therefore, the variables included in our study consisted of an integration and expansion of formal characteristics previously developed with adults, which showed promise in differentiating disturbed and normal groups of children. Based on these formal characteristics of TAT stories, 95% of the comparison group members and 85% of the disturbed group members were correctly classified.

Patients independently judged to have primarily an anaclitic or an introjective personality configuration (Blatt, 1974; Blatt &amp; Shichman, 1983) were assessed for psychiatric symptoms and aspects of interpersonal behavior both on admission and after an average of 15 months of treatment. Findings based on an independent assessment of TAT protocols at these two times indicated a significant (p less than .05) decline in total use of defenses for the entire sample, but especially for introjective patients. Further, this decline in total use of defenses in the TAT was significantly associated with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms. Also, sex-incongruent patients (anaclitic men and introjective women) were found to use different defenses and to change in ways different from sex-congruent patients (anaclitic women and introjective men).",M1

Thirty men and thirty women, divided equally between the two life stages, were randomly selected from a pool of individuals who had a same-sex, closely-spaced sibling. The Sibling Thematic Apperception Test (S-TAT) was developed to elicit underlying feelings about the relationship, because traditional methods of assessment have failed to tap its negative qualities. Contrary to previous findings, results showed no differences in affiliation or conflict theme frequencies between the CR and EN periods. Separation themes, however, were more frequent during the CR than the EN period, suggesting that concerns over separation from siblings reflect a developmental process which might be related to bonding with the family of procreation. Although there were no sex differences within life periods, women's stories about sisters across life period had more conflict themes than did men's stories about brothers.",M1

The separate anxiety measures utilized were total number of words, preludes to stories, outcomes to stories, combined preludes and outcomes, perceptual repression, and overall psychopathology. Situationally induced anxiety significantly affected subjects' performance; their stories contained more words, more preludes, more outcomes and more combined preludes and outcomes than stories obtained under non-anxiety-arousing conditions. Repressors gave more outcomes to their stories than did sensitizers. While anxiety-arousing conditions did produce these outward changes in story format, the dimensions of perceptual repression and overall story quality were unaffected.

The TATs were scored for intimacy motivation (McAdams, 1980)--a recurrent preference or readiness for experiences of warm, close, and communicative interaction with others. Controlling for age, education, and their interaction, high intimacy motivation in women was associated with greater happiness and gratification, whereas in men it was associated with lack of strain and lack of uncertainty. Women high in intimacy motivation who were living alone reported lower levels of gratification and more uncertainty in their lives than other women. Intimacy motivation also declined significantly over the life span for women, but not for men. Finally, demographic effects on intimacy motivation were examined.

Significant differences were found on gender identity as measured by greater differentiation of the drawn male figure as well as a trend toward drawing the male figure first. The CAH females also showed consistent patterns of psychosocial delay in dating and sexual relations as compared to the control group. Gender identity in this group appears to be mediated by body image.

Validity assessment in the case of thematic apperceptive measures of the achievement motive (<e>TAT</e> n Achievement) has been vulnerable to interpretive errors because these indicators of the achievement motive are typically much less reliable than indicators of other constructs to which the motive may be related, and no correction has been made for the bias introduced by such differential measurement error. Here we illustrate a causal modeling approach to validity assessment for TAT n Achievement that incorporates explicit true-score measurement models of theoretical constructs. We confirm the hypothesis that the achievement motive construct is positively related to work satisfaction in a representative sample of adult males in the United States, taken in 1976 (N = 413). Evidence for the discriminant validity of story content versus story length, an issue raised in the literature on the TAT, is also presented in this nomological network.",M1
6644541,"Is hostility linked with affiliation among males and with achievement among females? A critique of Pollak and Gilligan.This investigation attempted to replicate and to clarify methodologically an investigation by Pollak and Gilligan (1982). Those investigators reported sex differences in violence imagery to Thematic Apperception Test (<e>TAT</e>) pictures depicting affiliation and achievement situations. Pollak and Gilligan concluded that men perceive danger in situations of affiliation whereas women perceive danger in situations of achievement. It was demonstrated in the present study that Pollak and Gilligan incorrectly classified TAT cards into motivational categories, which may have resulted in incorrect inferences. In addition, their findings could not be replicated when using four different systems for classifying TAT cards into motivational categories. Other potential sources of error in their research, including a restrictive scoring scheme for hostility, unusual instructions, and failure to control for sex role in the TAT pictures, did not influence the pattern of results.",M1

Based on the score on Byrne's repression-sensitization scale, 16 repressors and 16 sensitizers were selected from 90 male subjects, and the TAT was administered to them. Results showed that the mean time required to tell a story for each card was shorter for repressors than for sensitizers. Repressors' stories were shorter, monotonous and stereotyped, while sensitizers' were longer and more dramatic. Sensitizers sometimes were unable to construct stories, depending instead on direct verbalizations of anxiety. Content analysis demonstrated that repressors tended to express need as located in the external situation and press as coming from the environment, while sensitizers tended to express press as originative with persons and manifested need to avoid that press. These results suggest that the TAT clearly differentiates between repressors and sensitizers and that the study of defense behavior as it relates to the repression-sensitization dimension requires a multiphasic understanding.",M1

Relying on Stoller's (1974) use of castration anxiety (CA) as an index of core male gender identity, it was predicted that FA males would have less secure gender identity and higher CA than FP males. The FP subjects were grouped into three subgroups according to ratings of the quality of father-son interaction (positive, neutral and negative). Social class, age, SAT scores and story-length did not discriminate between FAs and FPs. FAs were significantly higher in CA, but there were no significant differences between the three FP subgroups.

Fifth-grade boys and girls were presented a <e>TAT</e>-like projective test to measure fantasy aggression and controls over aggression. Overt peer-oriented aggression was measured by peer and teacher ratings. Results indicated that boys were rated more physically and verbally aggressive than girls but not more indirectly aggressive. Boys also produced more physical aggression in fantasy than girls, although the opposite trend was found for indirect aggression; no sex difference was found for verbal fantasy aggression. Finally, girls had a higher ratio of aggression control per total fantasy aggression than boys. The results support the position that while boys, in contrast to girls, are socialized in a way that encourage direct expression of aggression, girls are just as likely to be aggressive as boys when the aggression is indirect.

19789962," Soft  calcium crosslinks enable highly efficient gene transfection using <e>TAT</e> peptide.PURPOSE: Typically, low molecular weight cationic peptides or polymers exhibit poor transfection efficiency due to an inability to condense plasmid DNA into small nanoparticles. Here, efficient gene delivery was attained using TAT/pDNA complexes containing calcium crosslinks. METHODS: Electrostatic complexes of pDNA with TAT or PEI were studied with increasing calcium concentration. Gel electrophoresis was used to determine DNA condensation. The morphology of the complexes was probed by transmission electron microscopy. Transfection efficiency was assessed using a luciferase reporter plasmid. The accessibility of phosphate and amine groups within complexes was evaluated to determine the effect of calcium on structure. RESULTS: TAT/pDNA complexes were condensed into small, 50-100 nm particles by optimizing the concentration of calcium. Complexes optimized for small size also exhibited higher transfection efficiency than PEI polyplexes in A549 cells. TAT and TAT complexes displayed negligible cytotoxicity up to 5 mg/mL, while PEI exhibited high cytotoxicity, as expected. Probing the TAT-Ca/pDNA structure suggested that calcium interacted with both phosphate and amine groups to compact the complexes; however, these  soft  crosslinks could be competitively disrupted to facilitate DNA release. CONCLUSION: Small and stable TAT-Ca/pDNA complexes were obtained via  soft  calcium crosslinks leading to sustained gene expression levels higher than observed for control PEI gene vectors. TAT-Ca/pDNA complexes were stable, maintaining particle size and transfection efficiency even in the presence of 10% of FBS.

19472101,"<e>Tat</e>-modified leptin is more accessible to hypothalamus through brain-blood barrier with a significant inhibition of body-weight gain in high-fat-diet fed mice.Obesity in human was found mainly due to the poor transportation of leptin through brain-blood barrier (BBB), called as leptin resistance. To produce a leptin capable of penetrating BBB, we have added Tat-PTD(9) to the C terminal of leptin to construct a fusion protein. The fusion Tat-leptin and native leptin genes were synthesized by single-step insertion of a polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Rosseta). The expressing products were purified and renatured by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and identified by the molecular size in SDS-PAGE gel and by its immunoreactivity to specific antibody with Western-blotting assay. To bio-functionally evaluate the fusion protein, Balb/c mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) were given Tat-leptin, leptin or saline for 19 days. The immunohistochemical staining showed the increases in positive stains for the leptin in the region of hypothalamus of the HFD mice with either Tat-leptin or leptin as compared to saline group, but the staining intensity and frequency in the group with Tat-leptin were stronger and higher than those in the group with leptin. Furthermore, the most efficiency in preventing the body-weight gain caused by HFD was found in Tat-leptin group among these three groups. These results suggest that Tat-modified leptin may become a great potential candidate for the prevention or therapy of obese patients.",M2

In this study, an artery wall smooth muscle cell-targeting carrier was developed using TAT-HMGB1A combined with an artery wall binding peptide (ABP). For the production of ABP linked TAT-HMGB1A (TAT-HMGB1A-ABP), pET15b-TAT-HMGB1A-ABP was constructed by inserting the ABP cDNA into pET15b-TAT-HMGB1A. TAT-HMGB1A-ABP was expressed in E. coli and purified by Nickel chelate chromatography. Gel retardation assays showed that TAT-HMGB1A-ABP formed a complex with the plasmid at or above a 5:1 weight ratio (peptide:plasmid). At a 20:1 weight ratio, the zeta-potential was approximately 25 mV and the particle size was approximately 120 nm. TAT-HMGB1A-ABP had the highest transfection efficiency in A7R5 smooth muscle cells at a weight ratio of 20:1. TAT-HMGB1A-ABP exhibited higher transfection efficiency in A7R5 cells than PLL or TAT-HMGB1A, while TAT-HMGB1A-ABP had lower transfection efficiencies in Hep3B hepatoma, 293 kidney, NIH3T3 fibroblast, and Raw264.7 macrophage cells compared with PLL. Together, these results suggest that the ABP moiety of the peptide increased transfection efficiency specifically in smooth muscle cells. In a competition assay, the transfection efficiency of TAT-HMGB1A-ABP in A7R5 cells was reduced by the addition of free ABP. MTT assays showed that TAT-HMGB1A-ABP did not produce any cytotoxicity in A7R5 cells. Therefore, TAT-HMGB1A-ABP may be useful for a targeting gene delivery to smooth muscle cells.",M2

Gene delivery to target cells may be enhanced by using double-targeted delivery systems simultaneously capable of extracellular accumulation and intracellular penetration. With this in mind, we have used low cationic liposomes-plasmid DNA complexes (lipoplexes) modified with cell-penetrating transactivating transcriptional activator (TAT) peptide (TATp) and/or with monoclonal anti-myosin monoclonal antibody 2G4 (mAb 2G4) specific toward cardiac myosin, for targeted gene delivery to ischemic myocardium. In vitro transfection of both normoxic and hypoxic cardiomyocytes was enhanced by the presence of TATp as determined by fluorescence microscopy and ELISA. The in vitro transfection was further enhanced by the additional modification with mAb 2G4 antibody in the case of hypoxic, but not normoxic cardiomyocytes. However, we did not observe a synergism between TATp and mAb 2G4 ligands under our experimental condition. In in vivo experiments, we have clearly demonstrated an increased accumulation of mAb 2G4-modified TATp lipoplexes in the ischemic rat myocardium and significantly enhanced transfection of cardiomyocytes in the ischemic zone. Thus, the genetic transformation of normoxic and hypoxic cardiomyocytes can be enhanced by using lipoplexes modified with TATp and/or mAb 2G4. Such complexes also demonstrate an increased accumulation in the ischemic myocardium and effective transfection of hypoxic cardiomyocytes in vivo.",M2

The micelle formed via the dialysis method was approximately 95 nm in diameter and contained 15 wt.% of doxorubicin (DOX) by weight. The micelle surface hides TAT during circulation, which has the strong capability to translocate the micelle into cells, and exposes TAT at a slightly acidic tumor extracellular pH to facilitate the internalization process. The micelle core was engineered for disintegration in early endosomal pH of tumor cells, quickly releasing DOX. The ionization process of the block copolymers and ionized polymers assisted in disrupting the endosomal membrane. This processes permitted high DOX concentrations in the cytosol and its target site of the nucleus, thus increasing DOX potency in various wild and multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines (3.8-8.8 times lower IC50 than free DOX, depending on cell line). When tested with the xenografted tumors of human ovarian tumor drug-resistant A2780/AD, human breast tumor drug-sensitive MCF-7, human lung tumor A549 and human epidermoid tumor KB in a nude mice model, all tumors significantly regressed in size by three bolus injections at a dose of DOX 10 mg equivalent/kg body per injection of DOX-loaded micelle at three day interval, while minimum weight loss was observed.

18300036,"<e>Tat</e>-mediated intracellular delivery of T-bet protein into THP-1 cells can induce Th1-type response.T-bet, a Th1-specific transcription factor, can promote the production of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma is the principal Th1 effector cytokine and it has a crucial role in Th1 differentiation, which can drive the differentiation of naïve CD4+T cells into T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. In our study, a human T-bet gene was fused with a gene fragment encoding HIV-1 protein transduction domain in a bacterial expression vector to produce a Tat/T-bet fusion protein. The expressed and purified Tat/T-bet proteins were transduced efficiently into THP-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner; when Tat/T-bet pretreated THP-1 cells were co-cultured with CD4+T cells, the IFN-gamma level increased higher to about 7 pg/ml, 10-folds as compared with the normal level when tested at 48 hours. The results demonstrated that the Tat/T-bet fusion protein can be efficiently transduced into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like THP-1 cells and then regulated Th1/Th2 balance, which may act as a potential tool for gene therapy.",M2
18241354,"HIV-1 infection induces changes in expression of cellular splicing factors that regulate alternative viral splicing and virus production in macrophages.BACKGROUND: Macrophages are important targets and long-lived reservoirs of HIV-1, which are not cleared of infection by currently available treatments. In the primary monocyte-derived macrophage model of infection, replication is initially productive followed by a decline in virion output over ensuing weeks, coincident with a decrease in the levels of the essential viral transactivator protein <e>Tat</e>. We investigated two possible mechanisms in macrophages for regulation of viral replication, which appears to be primarily regulated at the level of tat mRNA: 1) differential mRNA stability, used by cells and some viruses for the rapid regulation of gene expression and 2) control of HIV-1 alternative splicing, which is essential for optimal viral replication. RESULTS: Following termination of transcription at increasing times after infection in macrophages, we found that tat mRNA did indeed decay more rapidly than rev or nef mRNA, but with similar kinetics throughout infection. In addition, tat mRNA decayed at least as rapidly in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Expression of cellular splicing factors in uninfected and infected macrophage cultures from the same donor showed an inverse pattern over time between enhancing factors (members of the SR family of RNA binding proteins) and inhibitory factors (members of the hnRNP family). While levels of the SR protein SC35 were greatly up-regulated in the first week or two after infection, hnRNPs of the A/B and H groups were down-regulated. Around the peak of virus production in each culture, SC35 expression declined to levels in uninfected cells or lower, while the hnRNPs increased to control levels or above. We also found evidence for increased cytoplasmic expression of SC35 following long-term infection. CONCLUSION: While no evidence of differential regulation of tat mRNA decay was found in macrophages following HIV-1 infection, changes in the balance of cellular splicing factors which regulate alternative viral pre-mRNA splicing were observed. These changes correlated with changes in Tat expression and virus production and could play an important role in viral persistence in macrophages. This mechanism could provide a novel target for control of infection in this critical cell type, which would be necessary for eventual eradication of the virus from infected individuals.",M2

We investigated the possible contribution of the extreme C terminus of HIV-1 Tat to maximize nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB activation, long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation, and viral replication in T cells. C-terminal deletion and substitution mutants made with the infectious clone HIV-89.6 were assayed for their ability to transactivate NF-kappaB-secreted alkaline phosphatase and HIV-1 LTR-luciferase reporter constructs for low concentrations of Tat. A mutant infectious clone of HIV-89.6 engineered by introducing a stop codon at aa 72 in the Tat open-reading frame (HIVDeltatatexon2) replicated at a significantly lower rate than the wild-type HIV-89.6 in phytohemagglutinin-A/IL-2-stimulated primary peripheral blood lymphocytes.

According to the latest study, the Tat (Transactivator of transcription) protein is essential in transcription and replication of viral genes, and is among the early expression genes involved in the life cycle of HIV. The virion NC (nucleocapsid) plays an important role in early mRNA expression and contributes to the rapid viral replication that occurs during HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between the Tat protein and nucleocapsid protein. In a comparison of two independently prepared and hybridized samples, flag NC overexpressed HEK 293T cells and pTat overexpressed HEK 293T cells, and hybridization showed the differences in expression in each case. Among the microarray results confirmed with real-time reverse transcriptase assay, twelve genes were identified to be involved according to their gene expression profiles. Of approximately 8,208 human genes that were analyzed, we monitored candidate genes that might have been related to NC and Tat genes from gene expression profiles.

Phylogenetically, all the LTRs and the paired env sequences clustered with subtype C reference strains. The LTRs demonstrated extensive polymorphism in the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within the enhancer and the modulator regions. We generated reporter vectors under the control of a select subset of the subtype C LTRs. The reporter vectors are distinguished by the simultaneous expression of two independent reporter genes, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), in response to <e>Tat</e>. Expression of EGFP was facilitated by engineering an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) into the expression cassette. Although subtype C strains cause a large majority of the global infections, and important differences in the transcription factor binding sites have been identified in the subtype C promoter, few reporter vectors containing subtype C-LTR have been described. We analyzed gene expression from the C-LTR reporter vectors in different cell lines under diverse experimental conditions and compared it to the B-LTR reporter vector. The reporter vectors were responsive to Tat derived from diverse viral subtypes. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of the reporter genes and the viral structural protein p24 when the cells were infected with viral molecular clones. The LTR reporters we developed could be of significant use in the study of viral transactivation, in the evaluation of biological properties of viral subtypes, and in the screening for antiviral inhibitors.",M2
17925344,"In vitro dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) spliced RNAs.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) packages its genomic RNA as a dimer of homologous RNA molecules that has to be selected among a multitude of cellular and viral RNAs. Interestingly, spliced viral mRNAs are packaged into viral particles with a relatively low efficiency despite the fact that they contain most of the extended packaging signal found in the 5' untranslated region of the genomic RNA, including the dimerization initiation site (DIS). As a consequence, HIV-1 spliced viral RNAs can theoretically homodimerize and heterodimerize with the genomic RNA, and thus they should directly compete with genomic RNA for packaging. To shed light on this issue, we investigated for the first time the in vitro dimerization properties of spliced HIV-1 RNAs. We found that singly spliced (env, vpr) and multispliced (<e>tat</e>, rev, and nef) RNA fragments are able to dimerize in vitro, and to efficiently form heterodimers with genomic RNA. Chemical probing experiments and inhibition of RNA dimerization by an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the DIS indicated that the DIS is structurally functional in spliced HIV-1 RNA, and that RNA dimerization occurs through a loop-loop interaction. In addition, by combining in vitro transcription and dimerization assays, we show that heterodimers can be efficiently formed only when the two RNA fragments are synthesized simultaneously, in the same environment. Together, our results support a model in which RNA dimerization would occur during transcription in the nucleus and could thus play a major role in splicing, transport, and localization of HIV-1 RNA.",M2
17499380,"Long terminal repeat sequences from virulent and attenuated equine infectious anemia virus demonstrate distinct promoter activities.In the early 1970s, the Chinese Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) vaccine, EIAV(DLA), was developed through successive passages of a wild-type virulent virus (EIAV(L)) in donkeys in vivo and then in donkey macrophages in vitro. EIAV attenuation and cell tropism adaptation are associated with changes in both envelope and long terminal repeat (LTR). However, specific LTR changes during Chinese EIAV attenuation have not been demonstrated. In this study, we compared LTR sequences from both virulent and attenuated EIAV strains and documented the diversities of LTR sequence from in vivo and in vitro infections. We found that EIAV LTRs of virulent strains were homologous, while EIAV vaccine have variable LTRs. Interestingly, experimental inoculation of EIAV(DLA) into a horse resulted in a restriction of the LTR variation. Furthermore, LTRs from EIAV(DLA) showed higher <e>Tat</e> transactivated activity than LTRs from virulent strains. By using chimeric clones of wild-type LTR and vaccine LTR, the main difference of activity was mapped to the changes of R region, rather than U3 region.",M2
17485285,"Overcoming HIV-1 resistance to RNA interference.RNAi refers to the sequence-specific degradation of RNA that follows the cellular introduction of homologous short interfering (si) RNA. RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the function of genes of known sequence in vitro and in vivo. Advances in vector design permit the effective expression of siRNA in human cells. Numerous recent investigations have described the ability of RNAi to decrease the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in lymphocytic cells using siRNA targeting viral (e.g. <e>tat</e>, gag, rev) and host (e.g. CCR5, CD4) proteins. Can RNAi be used as a form of genetic therapy for HIV-1 infection? Recent data indicate that the dynamic replication kinetics of HIV-1 pose a considerable barrier to achieving durable virus suppression by RNAi with the rapid emergence of HIV-1 mutants resistant to siRNA. This review summarizes recent work on HIV-1 specific RNAi with a focus on potential strategies to overcome HIV-1 resistance to RNAi.",M2
17474072,"Inhibition of HIV-1 multiplication by a modified U7 snRNA inducing <e>Tat</e> and Rev exon skipping.The HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are encoded by multiply spliced mRNAs that differ by the use of alternative 3' splice sites at the beginning of the internal exon. If these internal exons are skipped, the expression of these genes, and hence HIV-1 multiplication, should be inhibited. We have previously developed a strategy, based on antisense derivatives of U7 small nuclear RNA, that allows us to induce the skipping of an internal exon in virtually any gene. Here, we have successfully applied this approach to induce a partial skipping of the Tat, Rev (and Nef) internal exons. Three functional U7 constructs were subcloned into a lentiviral vector. Two of them strongly reduced the efficiency of lentiviral particle production compared to vectors carrying either no U7 insert or unrelated U7 cassettes. This defect could be partly or fully compensated by coexpressing Rev from an unspliced mRNA in the producing cell line. Upon stable transduction into CEM-SS or CEM T-lymphocytes, the most efficient of these constructs inhibits HIV-1 multiplication. Although the inhibition is not complete, it is more efficient in combination with another mechanism inhibiting HIV multiplication. Therefore, this new approach targeting HIV-1 regulatory genes at the level of pre-mRNA splicing, in combination with other antiviral strategies, may be a useful new tool in the fight against HIV/AIDS.",M2
17451348,"High frequency of defective vpu compared with <e>tat</e> and rev genes in brain from patients with HIV type 1-associated dementia.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection of the central nervous system frequently causes HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and other neurological disorders. The role of HIV regulatory and accessory proteins in the pathogenesis of these disorders is unclear. Here we analyzed sequences of tat, rev, and vpu genes in 55 subgenomic clones previously shown to encode functional env genes from brain and lymphoid tissues of four AIDS patients with HAD. Phylogenetic analysis showed distinct compartmentalization of tat, rev, and vpu genes in brain versus lymphoid tissues. Nine of 19 vpu sequences from brain of two patients had premature stop codons at positions between amino acids 2 and 30, compared with 0 of 8 from lymphoid tissues. Tat sequences from brain (n = 8 of 8) but not lymphoid (n = 0 of 6) tissue from one patient had a 35 amino acid truncation at the C-terminus. Rev sequences from the brain of one patient (n = 6 of 8) had a 5 amino acid truncation. These results demonstrate a high frequency of defective vpu compared with tat and rev genes in brain from HAD patients, and identify sequence variants of these regulatory/accessory genes that may influence the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological disease.",M2
17406343,"Safety and efficacy of a lentiviral vector containing three anti-HIV genes--CCR5 ribozyme, <e>tat</e>-rev siRNA, and TAR decoy--in SCID-hu mouse-derived T cells.Gene therapeutic strategies show promise in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and in restoring immunological function. A number of efficacious anti-HIV gene constructs have been described so far, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), RNA decoys, transdominant proteins, and ribozymes, each with a different mode of action. However, as HIV is prone to generating escape mutants, the use of a single anti-HIV construct would not be adequate to afford long range-viral protection. On this basis, a combination of highly potent anti-HIV genes--namely, a short hairpin siRNA (shRNA) targeting rev and tat, a transactivation response (TAR) decoy, and a CCR5 ribozyme--have been inserted into a third-generation lentiviral vector. Our recent in vitro studies with this construct, Triple-R, established its efficacy in both T-cell lines and CD34 cell-derived macrophages. In this study, we have evaluated this combinatorial vector in vivo. Vector-transduced CD34 cells were injected into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-hu mouse thy/liv grafts to determine their capacity to give rise to T cells. Our results show that phenotypically normal transgenic T cells are generated that are able to resist HIV-1 infection when challenged in vitro. These important attributes of this combinatorial vector show its promise as an excellent candidate for use in human clinical trials.",M2

METHODS: 8 subtype B' and 5 B'/C HIV-1 infected patients with slow disease progression were selected from Liaoning, Jilin and Yunnan province. 26 subtype B' and 9 B'/C HIV-1 infected patients with similar sex, age but with typical disease progression were selected. Provirus was extracted from the whole blood. The gene sequences of the Tat exon 1 were amplified by nest-polymerase chain reaction (nest-PCR). Products were purified and sequenced directly. The sequences were aligned, translated, amino acid substitution were analyzed and secondary structures were predicted. RESULTS: Many amino acid substitution could be found in the exon 1 of Tat in HIV-1 subtype B' and B'/C recombinant strain infected persons with different disease progression except A58T,none of them showed definitely relationship with HIV viral load and disease progression. 23N, 31S, 32Y and 46F were subtype-specific substitutions. No characteristic secondary structure of exon 1 of Tat was found. CONCLUSION: Some of the mutations of tat exon 1 might be related to HIV viral load and disease progression. However, there was no relationship found between the secondary structure of Tat protein and the disease progression.",M2
17209773,"Phylogenetic analysis of env, gag, and <e>tat</e> genes of HIV type 1 detected among the injecting drug users in West Bengal, India.A recent occurrence of HIV-1 seropositivity among a group of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Darjeeling, a hilly district in northern West Bengal, revealed overall 11.8% HIV seroprevalence. Our study based on env (C2-V3), gag (p24-p7), and tat (exon-1) genomic regions of HIV-1 detected among this population showed that Darjeeling IDU sequences belonged to subtype C. Interestingly, the IDU sequences from Darjeeling were again found to be closer to the C strains from Manipur, a northeastern state in India, which is linked to the Golden Triangle via the Manipur-Myanmar border, rather than the IDU C sequences from Nepal, a neighboring country of India. The outgroup reference strains from different sites of IDU-driven epidemics in the world like Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Spain belonged to the nonsubtype C group and formed separate clusters from the subtype C cluster in our analysis. These results indicate a rapid spread of HIV-1 by possible drug trafficking along international boundaries, which might also help in the invasion of HIV-1 among IDUs of Darjeeling through the Manipur-Myanmar border of India.",M2
17148965,"Potent knock down of HIV-1 replication by targeting HIV-1 <e>Tat</e>/Rev RNA sequences synergistically with catalytic RNA and DNA.OBJECTIVE: Ribozymes (Rzs) and DNA-enzymes (Dzs) possess the ability to prevent gene expression by cleaving target RNA in a catalytic and sequence-specific manner. Although Rzs or Dzs have been used earlier for HIV-1 gene suppression, the present study explored the possibility of using catalytic RNA and DNA simultaneously in a synergistic manner with the hope that this novel approach will allow more potent inhibition for a longer duration. METHODS: In order to achieve long-term inhibition of HIV-1 replication, a novel non-GUX hammerhead Rz was designed by standard recombinant DNA technology and cloned it under the powerful CMV promoter containing expression vector. A 10-23 catalytic motif containing Dz that was targeted against the conserved second exon of HIV-1 Tat/Rev region was also assembled. RESULTS: Both Rz and Dz possessed sequence-specific cleavage activities individually and simultaneously cleaved target RNA in a synergistic manner under the same in vitro cleavage conditions. These catalytic molecules inhibited HIV-1 replication in macrophages individually and exhibited potent inhibitory effects when used in combination. CONCLUSIONS: The combination strategy described here can be widely used against any target RNA to achieve more effective gene inhibition that exploits the simultaneous sequence-specific cleavage potentials of catalytic RNA and DNA.",M2
16934786,"Hyaluronan induces vascular smooth muscle cell migration through RHAMM-mediated PI3K-dependent Rac activation.OBJECTIVE: Hyaluronan (HA) is an important constituent of the extracellular matrix and is known to regulate cellular events through binding to CD44 and the receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM). Here we investigated the role of these receptors and the signaling pathways involved in HA-mediated effects in arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMC). METHODS: Effects of high-molecular weight HA (1 to 5 mg/ml) were analyzed in cultured ASMC from rat aorta. RESULTS: HA promoted actin stress fiber and lamellipodia formation and dose-dependently induced ASMC migration without effect on proliferation. Pull-down assay of Rho protein activity indicated that HA activated RhoA and Rac. HA-induced ASMC migration was not affected by the RhoA inhibitor <e>Tat</e>-C3 (10 microg/ml), the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10 microM) and blocking anti-CD44 antibody ,but was reduced by the non-selective Rho protein inhibitor simvastatin (10 microM), the Rac inhibitor LT-toxin (1 mug/ml), small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Rac and the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (25 microM), which also blocked HA-induced Rac activation. CD44 knockdown by siRNA inhibited HA-mediated RhoA activation without effect on ASMC migration. In contrast, siRNA targeting RHAMM inhibited both HA-induced migration and Rac activation. CONCLUSIONS: High-molecular weight HA independently activates RhoA and Rac through CD44 and RHAMM, respectively. HA-induced migration depends exclusively on RHAMM-mediated PI3K-dependent Rac activation.",M2
16764723,"Induction of the HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> co-factor cyclin T1 during monocyte differentiation is required for the regulated expression of a large portion of cellular mRNAs.BACKGROUND: P-TEFb, a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor, is composed of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) as a catalytic unit and either cyclin T1, T2 or K as a regulatory subunit. The cyclin T1/P-TEFb complex is targeted by HIV to mediate Tat transactivation. Cyclin T1 protein expression is induced during early macrophage differentiation, suggesting a role in regulation of mRNA expression during the differentiation process. To study the functional significance of cyclin T1 induction during differentiation, we utilized the human Mono Mac 6 (MM6) monocytic cell line. RESULTS: We found that cyclin T1 protein expression is induced by a post-transcriptional mechanism following PMA treatment of MM6 cells, similar to its induction in primary monocytes and macrophages. Also in agreement with findings in primary cells, cyclin T2a is present at relatively high levels in MM6 cells and is not induced by PMA. Although the knock-down of cyclin T1 in MM6 cells by shRNA inhibited HIV-1 Tat transactivation, MM6 cell growth was not affected by the depletion of cyclin T1. Using DNA microarray technology, we found that more than 20% of genes induced by PMA require cyclin T1 for their normal level of induction, and approximately 15% of genes repressed by PMA require cyclin T1 for their normal level of repression. Gene ontology analysis indicates that many of these cyclin T1-dependent genes are related to immune response and signal transduction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cyclin T1 serves a critical role in the program of macrophage differentiation, and this raises questions about the feasibility of cyclin T1 serving as an antiviral therapeutic target.",M2
16643974,"Correlation between SIV <e>Tat</e> evolution and AIDS progression in cerebrospinal fluid of morphine-dependent and control macaques infected with SIV and SHIV.Morphine abuse has been associated with higher virus replication and accelerated disease progression in a non-human primate model of AIDS. In our previous report, we have shown that 50% of morphine-addicted macaques progress rapidly and that 2/3 of the rapid progressors exhibit severe neuropathogenesis. In this report, we examined the sequence evolution of the SIV Tat protein, known to participate in AIDS neuropathology, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of morphine-dependent and control macaques over the first 20 weeks of infection. The CSF SIV Tat evolution was found to be inversely related with disease progression, and the highly neuropathogenic inoculum clone sequence was the prevalent CSF form in rapid progressors. Divergence from the inoculum clone was significantly greater in both morphine-dependent normal progressors and control macaques than in the morphine-dependent rapid progressors. Furthermore, we also found evidence of a trend that morphine alters the type of mutation, resulting in an enhanced ratio of transitions to transversions (Ts:Tv). Rapid disease exacerbates this trend and appears to influence the distribution of nonsynonymous changes in the first exon of SIV tat, with a clear majority of mutations occurring in the C-terminal half of the protein where the known functionally important domains reside. Thus, morphine abuse may change the nature and extent of mutations that drive viral evolution.",M2
16438649,"The Effect of a Single Nucleotide Substitution in the Splicing Silencer in the <e>tat</e>/rev Intron on HIV Type 1 Envelope Expression.A complex mRNA splicing pattern, which remains to be fully characterized, influences HIV-1 gene expression. In this study, poor envelope expression of a primary HIV-1 isolate was observed and linked to increased splicing of the two coding exons of tat/rev. The substitution of a nucleotide G, located 28 nucleotides upstream of the splice acceptor site SA7 in the recently identified intron splicing silencer sequence, was found to be responsible for the poor envelope expression. A single nucleotide substitution of G with A at this position results in a poor envelope expression phenotype. Moreover, substitution of the nucleotide G with any other nucleotide in an infectious HIV-1 proviral clone, HXB2RU3, results in poor envelope expression. The substitution of this nucleotide reduces the hnRNP A1 binding affinity but increases the splicing of env mRNA. The nucleotide G at this position is highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates and appears to play a critical role in HIV-1 splicing.",M2

Genetic variation remains a major obstacle in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine and recent strategies have focused on constructing vaccines based on the subtypes dominant in the developing world, where the epidemic is most severe. The vaccine, SAAVI DNA-C, contains an equimolar mixture of two plasmids, pTHr.grttnC and pTHr.gp150CT, which express a polyprotein derived from Gag, reverse transcriptase (RT), <e>Tat</e> and Nef, and a truncated Env, respectively. Genes included in the vaccine were obtained from individuals within 3 months of infection and selection was based on closeness to a South African subtype C consensus sequence. All genes were codon-optimized for increased expression in humans. The genes have been modified for safety, stability and immunogenicity. Tat was inactivated through shuffling of gene fragments, whilst maintaining all potential epitopes; the active site of RT was mutated; 124 aa were removed from the cytoplasmic tail of gp160; and Nef and Gag myristylation sites were inactivated. Following vaccination of BALB/c mice, high levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were induced against multiple epitopes and the vaccine stimulated strong CD8+ gamma interferon responses. In addition, high titres of antibodies to gp120 were induced in guinea pigs. This vaccine is the first component of a prime-boost regimen that is scheduled for clinical trials in humans in the USA and South Africa.",M2
16219384,"Linear double-stranded DNA that mimics an infective tail of virus genome to enhance transfection.Our previous work showed that a natural beta-(1--&gt;3)-d-glucan schizophyllan (SPG) can form a stable complex with single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs). When protein transduction peptides were attached to SPG and this modified SPG was complexed with ssODNs, the resultant complex could induce cellular transfection of the bound ODNs, without producing serious cytotoxicity. However, no technique was available to transfect double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA) or plasmid DNA using SPG. This paper presents a new approach to transfect dsDNA, showing preparation and transfection efficiency for a minimal-size gene having a loop-shaped poly(dA)(80) on both ends. This poly(dA) loops of dsDNA can form a complex with SPG. An siRNA-coding dsDNA with the poly(dA) loop was complexed with <e>Tat</e>-attached SPG to silence luciferase expression. When LTR-Luc-HeLa cells that can express luciferase under the control of the LTR promoter were exposed to this complex, the expression of luciferase was suppressed (i.e., RNAi effect was enhanced). Cytotoxicity studies showed that the Tat-SPG complex induced much less cell death compared to polyethylenimine, indicating that the proposed method caused less harm than the conventional method. The Tat-SPG/poly(dA) looped dsDNA complex had a structure similar to the viral genome in that the dsDNA ends were able to induce transfection and protection. The present work identifies the SPG and poly(dA) looped minimum-sized gene combination as a candidate for a non-toxic gene delivery system.",M2
16115802,"Long-term inhibition of HIV-1 infection in primary hematopoietic cells by lentiviral vector delivery of a triple combination of anti-HIV shRNA, anti-CCR5 ribozyme, and a nucleolar-localizing TAR decoy.Combinatorial therapies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection have proven to be effective in reducing patient viral loads and slowing the progression to AIDS. We have developed a series of RNA-based inhibitors for use in a gene therapy-based treatment for HIV-1 infection. The transcriptional units have been inserted into the backbone of a replication-defective lentiviral vector capable of transducing a wide array of cell types, including CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. The combinatorial therapeutic RNA vector harbors a U6 Pol III promoter-driven short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the rev and <e>tat</e> mRNAs of HIV-1, a U6 transcribed nucleolar-localizing TAR RNA decoy, and a VA1-derived Pol III cassette that expresses an anti-CCR5 ribozyme. Each of these therapeutic RNAs targets a different gene product and blocks HIV infection by a distinct mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the combinatorial vector suppresses HIV replication long term in a more-than-additive fashion relative to the single shRNA or double shRNA/ribozyme or decoy combinations. Our data demonstrate the validity and efficacy of a combinatorial RNA-based gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.",M2
16051143,"Stochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.HIV-1 Tat transactivation is vital for completion of the viral life cycle and has been implicated in determining proviral latency. We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system.",M2

16025547,"Optimisation of a multipartite human immunodeficiency virus based vector system; control of virus infectivity and large-scale production.BACKGROUND: We have previously described a five-plasmid HIV-1 vector system that utilises a codon-optimised gagpol gene. While this system was shown to be safer than systems using proviral type helpers, the titre of virus produced was relatively low. Therefore, a process of optimising all aspects of virus production was initiated. METHODS: A systematic approach was taken to the optimisation of virus production by transient expression using a five-plasmid packaging system. Codon-manipulation was used to reduce homology between helper and vector constructs. Ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation were used for large-scale virus production. RESULTS: We describe codon-optimised reading frames for <e>Tat</e> and Rev and the optimisation of virus production. The optimisation process resulted in an increase in virus titre of 7- to 8-fold. Several other approaches to increasing viral titre described by others proved ineffective in our system after it had been optimised. In addition, we show that by varying the ratio of the GagPol helper construct to vector, the infectivity of the virus could be controlled. The use of a novel codon-optimised HIV-1 GagPol expression construct with reduced homology to vector sequences significantly reduced transfer of gagpol sequences to transduced cells. Virus could be collected in serum-free medium without a significant loss of titre, which facilitated subsequent processing. Processing using a combination of ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation allowed efficient and rapid processing of litre volumes of virus supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: By taking a systematic approach to optimising all aspects of our five-plasmid lentiviral vector system we improved titre, safety, large-scale production, and demonstrated that infectivity could be specifically controlled.",M2
15916041,"The role of the <e>Tat</e> gene in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.The human immunodeficiency virus Tat regulatory protein is essential for virus replication and for the efficient transcription of HIV-1 provirus, and in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The role of the tat gene was investigated in 300 samples. It was found that 71.7% were subtype CRF_01AE, 9.3% were subtype B, while 11.7 and 7.3% of them were cross-reactive and non-typeable, respectively. Moreover the results from peptide ELISA also showed that a low CD4 cell count was related to a low anti-Tat antibody (p &lt; 0.05), which may be due to the progression of HIV-1, which can be found predominantly in AIDS patients. The results of nested PCR showed that the second Tat exon might also play a role in T-cell activation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure HIV-1 mRNA expression in PBMC. RT-PCR negative results were found mostly in the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive group (88%). HIV-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with current immunologic status. The differences in Tat protein sequences from DNA sequencing between the patients who had anti-Tat antibody positive and anti-Tat antibody negative, were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). These results suggested that the Tat amino acid sequences were conserved among each group of samples and did not change significantly compared with the consensus sequence in previous studies. Several factors make Tat an attractive target for vaccine design.",M2

We report here the results of a phase I gene transfer clinical trial using Rz2. METHODS: Apheresis was used to obtain a peripheral blood cell population from each of four HIV-negative donors. After enrichment for CD4+ T-lymphocytes, ex vivo expansion and genetic manipulation (approximately equal aliquots of the cells were transduced with the ribozyme-containing (RRz2) and the control (LNL6) retroviral vector), these cells were infused into the corresponding HIV-1-positive twin recipient. Marking was assessed over an initial 24-week period and in total over an approximate 4-year period. RESULTS: The gene transfer procedure was shown to be safe, and technically feasible. Both RRz2- and LNL6-gene-containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected at all time points examined to 4 years. There was concomitant gene construct expression in the absence of the need for ex vivo peripheral blood cell stimulation and there was no evidence of immune elimination of the neoR T-lymphocytes nor of silencing of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The proof of principle results reported here demonstrate safety and feasibility of this type of gene transfer approach. While not specifically tested, T-lymphocytes containing an anti-HIV gene construct may impact on HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, potentially representing a new therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection.",M2

15545352,"Determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 escape from the primary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in containment of virus replication in primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV's ability to mutate to escape from CTL pressure is increasingly recognized; but comprehensive studies of escape from the CD8 T cell response in primary HIV infection are currently lacking. Here, we have fully characterized the primary CTL response to autologous virus Env, Gag, and <e>Tat</e> proteins in three patients, and investigated the extent, kinetics, and mechanisms of viral escape from epitope-specific components of the response. In all three individuals, we observed variation beginning within weeks of infection at epitope-containing sites in the viral quasispecies, which conferred escape by mechanisms including altered peptide presentation/recognition and altered antigen processing. The number of epitope-containing regions exhibiting evidence of early CTL escape ranged from 1 out of 21 in a subject who controlled viral replication effectively to 5 out of 7 in a subject who did not. Evaluation of the extent and kinetics of HIV-1 escape from &gt;40 different epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses enabled analysis of factors determining escape and suggested that escape is restricted by costs to intrinsic viral fitness and by broad, codominant distribution of CTL-mediated pressure on viral replication.",M2
15280222,"Mapping sites of positive selection and amino acid diversification in the HIV genome: an alternative approach to vaccine design?A safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic. Traditional methods of vaccine development have been frustratingly slow, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that radical new approaches may be required. Computational and mathematical approaches, combined with evolutionary reasoning, may provide new insights for the design of an efficacious AIDS vaccine. Here, we used codon-based substitution models and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods to identify positively selected sites that are likely to be involved in the immune control of HIV-1. Analysis of subtypes B and C revealed widespread adaptive evolution. Positively selected amino acids were detected in all nine HIV-1 proteins, including Env. Of particular interest was the high level of positive selection within the C-terminal regions of the immediate-early regulatory proteins, <e>Tat</e> and Rev. Many of the amino acid replacements were associated with the emergence of novel (or alternative) myristylation and casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation sites. The impact of these changes on the conformation and antigenicity of Tat and Rev remains to be established. In rhesus macaques, a single CTL-associated amino substitution in Tat has been linked to escape from acute SIV infection. Understanding the relationship between host-driven positive selection and antigenic variation may lead to the development of novel vaccine strategies that preempt the escape process.",M2
15073028,"HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> enhances Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infectivity.The high frequency of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in immunodeficiency states, particularly in patients with AIDS, has been attributed to increased replication of KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a necessary cofactor for KS development. However, experimental KSHV infection of endothelial lineage cells that compose KS lesions has been difficult even in the absence of immune cells. Here we show that HIV-1 Tat protein can directly promote KSHV transmission. Full-length HIV-1 Tat and a 13-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the basic region of Tat specifically enhances the entry of KSHV into endothelial and other cells, presenting evidence for an active role of HIV-1 in the development of KSHV-associated diseases. These results can explain why AIDS-KS is more frequent and clinically more aggressive than KS in other immunodeficiency states.",M2
15018708,"Spliced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA within infected cells.Both the full-length and spliced RNA species of HIV-1 possess the necessary cis-acting elements including the primer binding site (PBS), the polypurine tract (PPT), as well as the 5' R and 3' R regions that are needed for their conversion to double-stranded cDNA through reverse transcription. Since measurable amounts of spliced viral RNA molecules can be detected within virus particles, we have examined the potential for reverse transcription of such virion-associated spliced viral RNA upon infection of permissive cells. Analysis of viral cDNA species by PCR and DNA sequencing not only led to the identification of viral DNA molecules that were reverse transcribed from full-length viral RNA, but also DNA molecules that displayed the same nucleotide sequences as those found in spliced viral RNA, except that the former harbored the complete long terminal repeats (LTR), a feature that distinguishes proviral DNA from viral genomic RNA. Further studies revealed various types of cDNA species that resemble the spliced viral RNA encoding each of the env, <e>tat</e>, rev, or nef genes, of which the nef cDNA represents the majority. Therefore, spliced HIV-1 RNA molecules must have been reverse transcribed along with full-length viral RNA during infection.",M2
14689754,"Gene therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection in the humanized SCID mouse model.BACKGROUND: The humanized SCID mouse model is an attractive tool for testing gene therapy to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection in vivo. OBJECTIVES: To devise a more specific gene therapy directed against HIV, replacing the formerly used interferon with either soluble CD4 molecule immunoadhesin (sCD4-IgG) and/or anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody (2F5), or HIV-negative transdominants genes (<e>Tat</e>, Rev). METHODS: Human monocytoid cell line (U937) was transfected with IFN alpha, beta or gamma genes. 3T3 murine fibroblastic cell line was transfected with sCD4-IgG or 2F5, or both genes, and a human T4 cell line (CEM) was grafted to SCID mice. Negative transdominant genes (Tat, Rev or both) were also transduced in CEM T cell line. Animals were then challenged with HIV-1, Viral load was followed. RESULTS: IFN alpha or beta were potent anti-HIV, reducing viral load in vivo and inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity in human-removed cells from animals. sCD4-IgG immunoadhesin and gp41 monoclonal antibody resulted in a dramatic reduction of HIV-1 cellular and plasmatic viral load in humanized SCID mice. The simultaneous introduction of negative Tat and Rev genes resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the marked reduction of HIV-1 propagation by IFN genes or by negative Tat and Rev transdominants, the gene therapy using soluble CD4 immunoadhesin or anti-gp41 was a more efficient preventive treatment against HIV infection.",M2
14595379,"The cationic region from HIV <e>tat</e> enhances the cell-surface expression of epitope/MHC class I complexes.The potential of genetic immunization has been acknowledged for almost a decade, but disappointing immunogenicity in humans has delayed its introduction into the clinical arena. To try to increase the potency of genetic immunization, we and others have evaluated 'translocatory' proteins, which are thought to exit living cells by an uncharacterized pathway, and enter neighboring cells in an energy-independent manner. Several laboratories, including our own, have begun to question these remarkable properties. Our previous studies showed that the ability of an epitope to induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted CD8(+) T cells was, indeed, enhanced by its being attached to the proposed translocatory sequence of the HIV-1 tat protein. However, we found little evidence that the increased immunogenicity resulted from transfer of the fusion peptide between living cells, and we proposed that it resulted instead from an increased epitope/MHC expression on the surface of transfected cells. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We show that cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding an epitope, and the relevant MHC class I allele, can stimulate epitope-specific T cells, and that attachment of the epitope to a putative translocatory sequence - which we term herein an 'integral cationic region' (ICR) - leads to a marked increase in stimulatory activity. This elevated stimulatory capacity does not result from a nonspecific increase in MHC class I expression. We use a high-affinity T-cell receptor (TcR) specific for the epitope/MHC combination to quantitate directly the cell-surface expression of the immunogenic complex, and we show that the attachment of the tat ICR to an epitope results in a substantial enhancement of its cell-surface presentation. These data suggest an alternative explanation for the immune enhancement seen with ICRs.",M2
14581533,"Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in primary macrophages by using <e>Tat</e>- or CCR5-specific small interfering RNAs expressed from a lentivirus vector.Although several groups have demonstrated that RNA interference, induced by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, can protect cells against a viral challenge in culture, this protection is transient. Here, we describe lentivirus expression vectors that can stably express siRNAs at levels sufficient to block virus replication. We have used these vectors to stably express siRNAs specific for the essential human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat transcription factor or specific for a cellular coreceptor, CCR5, that is required for infection by the majority of primary HIV-1 isolates. These lentivirus vectors are shown to protect cells, including primary macrophages, against HIV-1 infection in culture by inducing selective degradation of their target mRNA species. These data suggest that it should be possible to block the expression of specific viral or cellular genes in vivo by using viral vectors to stably express the appropriate siRNAs.",M2
12932636,"Anti-cancer protein transduction strategies: reconstitution of p27 tumor suppressor function.Significant scientific effort focused on understanding the molecular basis of oncogenesis has identified multiple tumor suppressor genes and their corresponding functions. The ultimate goal of this work is to use this knowledge to devise anti-cancer strategies that specifically kill tumor cells in vivo, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Unfortunately, tumor suppressor proteins, while maintaining specificity for their intracellular targets, are often in excess of 20,000 Da and hence, undeliverable in vivo. To address the delivery problem, we previously further developed a protein transduction strategy that allows for the rapid delivery of large, biologically active proteins in excess of 100,000 Da into approximately 100% of cells in culture and most, if not all, cells/tissues in mouse models. The strategy involves the generation of an N-terminal fusion protein that contains the <e>TAT</e> protein transduction domain. Here the ability to manipulate tumor biology in several mouse tumor models in vivo is demonstrated by using protein transduction to delivery the p27(Kip) tumor suppressor protein. These observations serve as a starting point to further develop the delivery of peptide and proteins to specifically treat malignancies in vivo.",M2
12907155,"HIV vector production mediated by Rev protein transduction.HIV-1-based vectors are promising tools for gene therapy because of their ability to integrate into nondividing cells. Their safety in clinical applications remains a major concern. Recombination events occurring among plasmid constructs during vector production could potentially lead to the generation of replication-competent viruses. The safety of HIV-1-based vectors can be improved by removing all regions of the viral genome that are not absolutely required for vector production or function. In this study, we demonstrate that the HIV-1 rev gene is dispensable for the production of HIV-1-based vectors if the vector-producing cells are supplied with purified Rev protein. We compared the efficiency of vector production among Rev, <e>TAT</e>-Rev (Rev fused to the protein transduction domain of the HIV TAT protein), and Rev/Pep-1 (Rev complexed with the carrier peptide Pep-1). Our results showed that 293T cells efficiently internalized TAT-Rev and Rev/Pep-1 and high-titer vector preparations were obtained with this approach. Vectors generated by such an approach showed little difference in their efficiencies of transduction of established cell lines and primary cells compared with vectors generated by standard plasmid cotransfection. Eliminating the requirement for the HIV-1 rev gene during vector production should improve the safety of applying HIV vectors in human clinical trials.",M2
12870121,"Lack of detectable human immunodeficiency virus type 1 superinfection during 1072 person-years of observation.We examined consecutive protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected individuals, to distinguish changes resulting from sequence evolution due to possible superinfection. Between July 1997 and December 2001, &gt;/=2 PR and RT samples from 718 persons were sequenced at Stanford University Hospital. Thirty-seven persons had highly divergent sequence pairs characterized by a nucleotide distance of &gt;4.5% in PR or &gt;3.0% in RT. In 16 of 37 sequence pairs, divergence resulted from the loss of mutations during a treatment interruption or from the gain of mutations with reinstitution of treatment. <e>tat</e> and/or gag sequencing of HIV-1 from cryopreserved plasma samples could be performed on 15 of the 21 divergent isolate pairs from persons without a treatment interruption. The sequences of these genes, unaffected by selective drug pressure, were monophyletic. Although HIV-1 PR and RT genes from treated persons may become highly divergent, these changes usually are the result of sequence evolution, rather than superinfection.",M2

METHODS: The target fragments of BIV tat, LTR and HIV gag, pol, env were respectively amplified by using PCR and sequentially inserted into pBluescript SK(+) vector. The chimeric clone was transfected into human MT4 cells. The transcript and gene expression of the HBIV chimeric virus were detected by using RT-PCR and a reverse transcriptase assay, respectively. RESULTS: BIV tat mRNA and HIV gag mRNA were detected. The reverse transcriptase activity of the chimeric virus was analyzed in the fluctuation curve. CONCLUSIONS: In chimeric HBIV cDNA transfected MT?4 cells, BIV tat and HIV gag were transcripted. The reverse transcriptase of the chimeric virus had biological activity. These data suggest that in MT4 cells, BIV LTR had promoter activity and BIV tat had the function of transactivation in the chimeric virus.

To study the diversity and genetic characteristics of group O, we have sequenced the accessory genes of 7 isolates. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences for Vif, Vpr, <e>Tat</e>, Vpu, and Rev indicate that most of the functional domains of these proteins, as described for group M viruses, are highly conserved and retained among all the group O strains we have characterized. The only difference concerns the Vif phosphorylation sites, which are absent in all of the group O isolated we have sequence with the exception of two isolates in which only one phosphorylation site was conserved. These sites, present in nearly all of the group M isolates, play a critical role in the regulation of viral replication and infectivity. As described for group M isolates, the vpu gene is the one with the highest diversity among group O viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences suggests that group O viruses could be differentiated into at least four different clusters.",M2

METHODS: The blood was collected from HIV-1 infected individual (SC9 712) in Sichuan Province. The peripheral blod mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood by ficoll and the genomic DNA was extracted. The gag gene, the C2-V3 of the env gene and the first exon of tat gene were amplified by nested-PCR and sequenced directly. RESULTS: The genetic distance respectively is 7.56% in tat gene between SC9 712 and UG274A, 9.59% and 9.94% in gag gene between SC9 712 and K31 and VI203, 13.86% in env gene between SC9 712 and MAL. On the phylogenetic tree the SC9 712 HIV-1 strain clustered with the Africa subtype D strains UG274A, K31, VI203 and MAL. The above data demonstrated that SC9 712 was subtype D HIV-1 strain. Epidemiological data showed that SC9 712 virus was from a person who had worked in Africa.

We exploited such a unique feature in a novel anti-HIV-1 gene therapy design by constructing an HIV-1 <e>Tat</e>-defective lentivirus vector expressing the product of fusion between the low-affinity human nerve growth factor receptor truncated in its intracytoplasmic domain (deltaNGFr, NH(2) moiety), and F12Nef (COOH moiety), under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeats. In this manner, both the selection marker (deltaNGFr) and the anti-HIV-1 effector are comprised in the same fusion protein, the expression of which is targetable by HIV-1 infection. Such a vector was proved to transduce human cells efficiently and, on HIV-1 infection, it expressed high levels of the fusion protein. In addition, strong antiviral activity of the deltaNGFr/F12Nef-expressing vector was demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary cell cultures challenged with T- or M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Thus, the HIV-1-targetable expression of the deltaNGFr/F12Nef fusion protein represents a novel and powerful tool for an effective anti-HIV-1 gene therapy strategy.",M2
12396604,"Design and in vivo immunogenicity of a polyvalent vaccine based on SIVmac regulatory genes.Most vaccine modalities for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the SIVmac (simian immunodeficiency virus) macaque model do not include the viral regulatory proteins. Because viral regulatory proteins are expressed early during the virus life cycle and represent an additional source of antigens, their inclusion as a vaccine component may increase the overall virus-specific immune response in vaccinees. However, at least two of the early proteins, <e>Tat</e> and Nef, may be immunosuppressive, limiting their usefulness as components of an SIV vaccine. We have constructed a polyvalent chimeric protein in which the open reading frames for Tat and Nef have been reassorted and the nuclear localization sequence for Tat and Rev and the myristoylation site for Nef have been removed. The resulting DNA plasmid (pDNA-SIV-Retanef) (pDNA-SIV-RTN) encodes a protein of 55 kDa (Retanef) that localizes at the steady state in the cytoplasma of transfected cells. Both the DNA-SIV-RTN and the highly attenuated recombinant poxvirus vector NYVAC-SIV-RTN were demonstrated to be immunogenic in SIVmac251-infected macaques treated with ART as well as in naive macaques. An equivalent strategy may be used for the generation of polyvalent antigens encoding the regulatory proteins in a HIV-1 vaccine candidate.",M2
12350353,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcription is stimulated by <e>tat</e> from other lentiviruses.The tat gene is required by HIV-1 for efficient reverse transcription and this function of Tat can be distinguished from its role in transcription by RNA polymerase II using tat point mutations that abrogate each function independently. The mechanism of Tat's role in reverse transcription, however, is not known, nor is it known whether this role is conserved among trans-activating factors in other retroviruses. Here we examine the abilities of heterologous viral trans-activating proteins from jembrana disease virus (jTat), HIV-2 (Tat2), and equine infectious anemia virus (eTat) to substitute for HIV-1 Tat (Tat1) and restore reverse transcription in HIV-1 carrying an inactivated tat gene. Natural endogenous reverse transcription assays showed that trans-activators from some retroviruses (Tat2 and jTat, but not eTat) could substitute for Tat1 in complementation of HIV-1 reverse transcription. Finally, we show that Y47 is critical for Tat1 to function in reverse transcription, but not HIV-1 gene expression. We mutated the homologous position in jTat to H62Y and found it did not improve its ability to stimulate reverse transcription, but an H62A mutation did inhibit jTat complementation. These data highlight the finding that the role of Tat in reverse transcription is not related to trans-activation and demonstrate that other tat genes conserve this function.",M2
12212929,"Residual cell-associated unspliced HIV-1 RNA in peripheral blood of patients on potent antiretroviral therapy represents intracellular transcripts.Unspliced HIV-RNA (HIV-UsRNA) associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) persists in patients on potent antiretroviral therapy even in the absence of detectable plasma HIV-RNA. To further characterize such residual HIV-RNA, cell-associated virion-encapsidated HIV and intracellular unspliced HIV-RNA were differentiated and monitored using a novel highly sensitive method. In addition, expression of HIV-mRNA encoding <e>tat</e> and rev was assessed. PBMCs of patients with unsuppressed plasma viraemia harboured an extracellular fraction of HIV-UsRNA, which correlated highly with intracellular HIV-RNA levels. Thus, extracellular PBMC-associated HIV-RNA may, to a significant extent, reflect nascent virions attached to productively infected cells. Upon treatment with potent antiretroviral therapy resulting in plasma viraemia &lt;50 copies/ml, expression of cell-associated viral particles was hardly discernible in PBMCs but transcription of unspliced HIV-RNA persisted. Given the virtual absence of rev-mRNA, translation of residual HIV-UsRNA was probably precluded by retention of these transcripts in the nucleus. As shown by limiting dilution analysis, HIV-1 infected cells with such a repressed viral transcription pattern were observed at high frequencies in PBMC from untreated patients.",M2
12163269,"A novel chimeric Rev, <e>Tat</e>, and Nef (Retanef) antigen as a component of an SIV/HIV vaccine.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory proteins Rev, Tat, and Nef are expressed at early time post-infection and represent attractive targets to be included in a vaccine candidate for AIDS. However, the putative immunosuppressive activities of some of these proteins may limit their immunogenicity. To circumvent these issues, a novel chimeric polyprotein vaccine candidate (Retanef), comprising genetically modified and re-assorted rev, tat, and nef open reading frames of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), was constructed and optimized for its expression in mammalian cells. Retanef encodes a protein of approximately 55 kDa localized primarily in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. The Retanef gene expressed in context of an eucaryotic expression vector (DNA-SIV-Retanef) or cloned into a highly attenuated poxvirus-based NYVAC vector (NYVAC-SIV-Retanef) was used to immunize either naive rhesus macaques or macaques chronically infected with SIVmac251 undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Three immunizations of naive macaques with DNA-SIV-Retanef followed by a single NYVAC-SIV-Retanef boost induced a response to the Mamu-A(*)01-restricted Tat epitope (Tat_SL8, TTPESANL) demonstrated by staining with a specific tetramer and by direct cytolytic activity assays, as well as responses to Rev, Tat and Nef proteins demonstrated by ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools encompassing the entire proteins. Immunization of infected macaques with either DNA-SIV-Retanef or NYVAC-SIV-Retanef expanded the frequency of Tat-specific tetramer-staining cells by two- to seven-fold. No adverse effects were observed in either naive or SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Thus, an analogous HIV-1-based chimeric vaccine may represent useful component of an HIV-1 vaccine.",M2

Phylogenetic analysis revealed a subtype C 5' LTR cluster, as well as subclustering of our nef sequences with various subtype C strains separate from the India and China subclusters. At least 3 NF-kappaB sites were present in the 5' LTR of most isolates and 13 isolates had the subtype C-specific Rev truncation.

Residue variation in the myristoylation signal and motifs involved in CD4 and MHC-I downregulation was recorded in our nef gene sequences.",M2
11776437,"A simple screening system for anti-HIV drugs: syncytium formation assay using T-cell line tropic and macrophage tropic HIV env expressing cell lines--establishment and validation.The first step in cellular entry of HIV involves binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (gp120/gp41) to specific receptor molecules on the target cells. The cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation) between env expressing cells and CD4+ cells mimics the viral infection of the host cells. To search for anti-HIV substances preventing this process, we constructed the recombinant cell lines, HeLa/CD4/Lac-Z and HeLa/T-env/<e>Tat</e> for T-cell tropic (HIV-1(NL4-3)) system, and HOS/CD4/CCR5/Lac-Z and HeLa/M-env/Tat for macrophage tropic (HIV-1(SF162)) system. When each pair of cells were co-incubated for 20 hours, the multinuclear giant cells (syncytia) were formed and beta-galactosidase was expressed. These systems are less biohazardous because no infectious virus particles are used. Their validity in screening for anti-HIV substances which inhibit syncytium formation was confirmed using various known HIV entry inhibitors.",M2

Promoter elements in the U3 region of the 3' LTR of the vector pLXSN were deleted and replaced with DNA encoding the HIV anti-tat gene under control of the tRNAmet promoter to produce a double copy self inactivating vector (DC-SIN). DC-SIN constructs were compared to vectors containing the anti-tat cassette inserted at 5 different sites of the U3 region (DC-insertions). Titres of DC-SIN and DC-insertion vectors were similar but approximately 10 fold lower than parental pLXSN. Cells transduced with DC-SIN and DC-insertion vectors all expressed anti-tat mRNA. Transcripts from the MLV-LTR were detected in cells transduced with DC-insertion but not DC-SIN vectors or a vector with the anti-tat cassette between CAAT and TATA boxes of the promoter, indicating inactivation of the viral promoter in the latter vectors. Cells transduced with constructs of either design showed comparable efficacy of protection against HIV challenge. Thus, no U3 insertion site was preferred for virus production. Insertion of a tRNA promoter between CAAT and TATA boxes and the DC-SIN design which would not introduce an active RNA pol II promoter into the genome are attractive for further development of safe gene therapy agents.",M2

It is caused by HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C). In this study we present the identification and analysis of cumulative cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the southern African country of Botswana. CTLs were shown to be an important component of the immune response to control HIV-1 infection. The definition of optimal and dominant epitopes across the HIV-1C genome that are targeted by CTL is critical for vaccine design. The characteristics of the predominant virus that causes the HIV-1 epidemic in a certain geographic area and also the genetic background of the population, through the distribution of common HLA class I alleles, might impact dominant CTL responses in the vaccinee and in the general population. The enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) gamma interferon assay has recently been shown to be a reliable tool to map optimal CTL epitopes, correlating well with other methods, such as intracellular staining, tetramer staining, and the classical chromium release assay. Using Elispot with overlapping synthetic peptides across Gag, Tat, Rev, and Nef, we analyzed HIV-1C-specific CTL responses of HIV-1-infected blood donors. Profiles of cumulative Elispot-based CTL responses combined with diversity and sequence consensus data provide an additional characterization of immunodominant regions across the HIV-1C genome. Results of the study suggest that the construction of a poly-epitope subtype-specific HIV-1 vaccine that includes multiple copies of immunodominant CTL epitopes across the viral genome, derived from predominant HIV-1 viruses, might be a logical approach to the design of a vaccine against AIDS.",M2
11438838,"SV40-derived vectors provide effective transgene expression and inhibition of HIV-1 using constitutive, conditional,and pol III promoters.Vectors based on recombinant SV40 viruses (rSV40) are highly effective in delivering transgene expression driven by constitutive promoters. We tested here whether these vectors could be used with conditional promoters and promoters using RNA polymerase III transcription, with inhibition of HIV-1 by <e>Tat</e> activation response (TAR) decoys as a functional measure of effective transgene delivery and activity. TAR decoys inhibit HIV-1 Tat, a trans-activator of HIV-1 transcription. Tat acts early in the viral replicative cycle and is essential for efficient viral replication. We evaluated rSV40 gene delivery using two different inhibitors of Tat. One was a dual function polyTAR gene encoding 25 sequential TAR elements (TAR(25)), plus an antisense tat, driven either by HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-LTR) as a conditional promoter, or by cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (CMV-IEP) as a constitutive promoter. The other inhibitor was a single TAR decoy, driven by the U6 small nuclear RNA promoter (U6-P). These decoys were delivered to unselected cells in two different human T lymphocyte lines and to unstimulated primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). Gene delivery was confirmed by PCR, and expression by RT-PCR. By in situ hybridization analysis, &gt;95% of cells were transduced. These transgene constructs protected all cell types tested from HIV-1, as measured by syncytia formation and p24 antigen release. Somewhat better inhibition of HIV-1 replication was achieved with HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) as a conditional promoter than with the constitutive CMV-IEP. The U6-P was also very effective, driving a TAR(1) transcript. Cell viability was not detectably affected by TAR decoy expression. Thus, rSV40 vectors effectively deliver HIV-1-inhibitory RNAs using either constitutive or conditional pol II promoters, or using a pol III promoter. The versatility of this gene delivery system may prove to be useful in anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.",M2
11429117,"Characterization of HIV type 1 <e>tat</e> sequences associated with perinatal transmission.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat exon I sequences were analyzed from six mother-infant pairs after perinatal transmission. The tat open reading frame was maintained in 140 of the 154 clones analyzed, with a 90.9% frequency of intact tat open reading frames. In addition, a low degree of heterogeneity was observed in tat sequences within mothers, within infants, and between epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. However, the distances of tat sequences between epidemiologically unlinked individuals were greater than in epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. The infant sequences showed amino acid sequence patterns similar to those present in their respective mothers. The functional domains required for Tat function, including amino-terminal, cysteine-rich, core and basic regions, which constitute domains for activation and RNA binding, were highly conserved in most of the sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of 154 mother-infant tat sequences showed that they formed distinct clusters for each mother-infant pair and grouped with subtype B sequence. These findings suggest that an intact and functional tat gene is conserved in HIV-1 mother-infant isolates that are involved in perinatal transmission.",M2
11365600,"Fusion inhibitors, T-20; chemokine variants; <e>tat</e> and interferon antibodies: Gallo describes three new treatment approaches.Virologist Robert Gallo described three new antiretroviral treatment approaches for HIV at the 12th World AIDS Conference. The three treatments, fusion inhibitors, chemokines, and alpha and tat interferon antibodies, differ substantially from the treatments now used. The process of cell fusion may offer many potential targets for fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials have shown that viral load drops faster with fusion inhibitors than with currently approved regimens. T-20 is one of the fusion inhibitors now under development by Trimeris, Inc. Chemokines, which interact with receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, are believed to have antiretroviral effects. However, chemokines' normal functioning may have some problematic effects. Developing variants of these chemokines may solve some of these problems by allowing the chemokines to have antiretroviral effects, without the normal functioning of chemokines. Antibodies against tat and alpha interferon may also be effective in HIV treatment. HIV kills some T-cells directly, but the larger decline in the number of T-cells is thought to be associated with an overproduction of alpha interferon and tat cells. Antibodies against the alpha interferon and tat cells may restore T-cell reproduction to normal levels.",M2

A previous study reported that immunization with pENV or pTAT-ENV induces IgG2 biased antibody responses to plasmid encoded CAEV surface envelope protein (SU). We show here that regional lymph nodes (LN) of pENV and pTAT-ENV immunized goats contain a dominant subset of SU activated IFNgamma+ Th1 lymphocytes. Co-immunization with pENV or pTAT-ENV and a caprine IFNgamma cDNA expression plasmid (pcIFNgamma) did not potentiate activation of SU responsive Th1 lymphocytes. However, the antibody response to SU encoded by pTAT-ENV was inhibited by co-immunization with pcIFNgamma. Results indicate that synergistic effects of CAEV Tat and IFNgamma suppress the primary adaptive B cell response to plasmid encoded SU.",M2
11311202,"Amplification of extracellular matrix and oncogenes in <e>tat</e>-transfected human salivary gland cell lines with expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens I, III, IV, c-myc and p53.Considerable progress has been made in the transfer of foreign genes into salivary glands in vivo using adenovirus vectors in rats. In an attempt to avoid the transient expression inherent, when using these vectors, retroviral vectors and human cell lines where used here in attempt to develop an in vitro model of HIV-associated salivary gland disease. The HIV-1-tat protein is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of the AIDS through altering the expression of strategic cellular genes. The purpose of this study was to transfect human salivary gland (HSG) cell lines in vitro, with the pHIV-1/LTR-tat plasmid, and examine the effect of tat on expression of matrix and basement membrane genes known to be important in the pathogenesis of salivary gland disease. HSG cells were transfected with HIV-1-tat plasmid by the lipofection method. Transfection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot, which verified that tat-specific DNA was present. Tat-mRNA was analysed by Northern blotting and quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its expression. Numerous clones were found to contain integrated tat DNA sequences and analysis of mRNA showed stable expression of tat-specific RNA. Further analysis of mRNA expression for various marker proteins important in HIV pathogenesis showed that the HSG cell line transfected with HIV-1-tat, was associated with significant induction of mRNA expression for extracellular matrix protein. Tat-amplified transcription of the major basement membrane protein laminin, as well as of fibronectin, collagen I and III, and c-myc oncogene was demonstrated. Conversely, expression of p53 suppressor gene mRNA was reduced. Post-transfection expression of collagen IV was erratic and inconclusive. It was concluded that the presence of HIV-tat in this in vitro model of salivary ductal epithelial cell model alters the mRNA expression of several matrix, basement membrane and oncoproteins known to be involved in HIV pathogenesis. These cell lines provide a useful system for studying the role of tat in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-associated salivary gland disease.",M2

11238879,"Repair of a Rev-minus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mutant by activation of a cryptic splice site.We isolated a revertant virus after prolonged culturing of a replication-impaired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutant of which the Rev open reading frame was inactivated by mutation of the AUG translation initiation codon. Sequencing of the <e>tat</e>-rev region of this revertant virus identified a second-site mutation in tat that restored virus replication in the mutant background. This mutation activated a cryptic 5' splice site (ss) that, when used in conjunction with the regular HIV 3' ss #5, fuses the tat and rev reading frames to encode a novel T-Rev fusion protein that rescues Rev function. We also demonstrate an alternative route to indirectly activate this cryptic 5' ss by mutational inactivation of an adjacent exon splicing silencer element.",M2
11228375,"DNA vaccination in mice using HIV-1 nef, rev and <e>tat</e> genes in self-replicating pBN-vector.The immunogenicity of a self-replicating DNA-vector containing HIV-1 nef gene (pBN-Nef) was characterized using various DNA delivery methods. In addition, gene gun immunisation was used for assessing immunogenicity of two other HIV-1 genes (rev and tat) given in the same vector. The pBN-Nef was the most immunogenic raising both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice; these responses lasted for up to six months. The pBN-Nef vector was immunogenic also when given intramuscularly or intradermally. The pBN-Rev construct did not elicit humoral responses but did elicit proliferative as well as CTL-response against the corresponding protein. The pBN-Tat was a poor immunogen in all respects. The antibodies elicited with various DNA delivery methods belonged to different antibody subclasses; however, two main epitopes in Nef were frequently recognized by all of them.",M2
11036088,"Transduction of <e>TAT</e>-HA-beta-galactosidase fusion protein into salivary gland-derived cells and organ cultures of the developing gland, and into rat submandibular gland in vivo.We have studied the transduction of TAT-HA-beta-galactosidase fusion protein into two cell lines of rat salivary gland origin, A5 and C6-21, into cells of fetal mouse submandibular glands in organ culture, and into rat submandibular gland after retrograde duct injection, using a histochemical method to demonstrate beta-galactosidase activity. Transduction of the fusion protein into A5 and C6-21 cells was concentration- and time-dependent. Therefore, the intensity of the beta-galactosidase staining, which was cytoplasmic, was less after 1 hr of exposure compared to exposures up to 24 hr. However, the fusion protein was transduced into 100% of both types of cultured cells. When explants of mouse fetuses at 13 days of gestation were exposed to the fusion proteins, both epithelial and mesenchymal cells were stained for the enzyme, with a conspicuous accumulation of the reaction product at perinuclear cytoplasmic regions. The histochemical staining of the mesenchymal cells was more intense compared to that seen in epithelial cells. TAT-HA-beta-galactosidase fusion protein was also delivered to rat submandibular glands by retrograde duct injection. Histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase activity of cryostat sections prepared from the injected glands revealed that the transduction of the fusion protein was also time- and dose-dependent. In the glands of rats sacrificed from 10 min to 1 hr after the retrograde injection, essentially all acinar and duct cells showed cytoplasmic staining. The intensity of the staining then declined, and was not seen in the glands of rats killed 24 hr after the injection of the fusion proteins. These results indicate that a full-length, active TAT fusion protein can be targeted to salivary gland cells both in vitro and in vivo to analyze physiological, developmental, and pathophysiological processes.",M2
11033786,"[Effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef and <e>tat</e> genes on rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells]The regulatory genes nef and tat of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were transferred into the rat pheochromocytoma cells (line PC12) under the control of the eukaryotic promoters. Proliferative activity of the PC12 cells transfected with the tat HIV-1 gene was substantially increased as compared to the control. Conversely, the nef gene introduced into the cultivated PC12 cell caused inhibition of their proliferative activity and formation of cell agglomerates resembling in morphology the multinuclear syncytial cells. Thus, our results suggest that the tat gene activates proliferation of the cultivated PC12 cells, whereas the nef gene inhibits proliferation of the same cells. We have obtained for the first time a direct indication for the possible role of the nef gene in formation of multinuclear T-lymphocyte and macrophage syncytium in HIV-1-infected patients. The HIV-1 nef and tat genes had no significant effect on the neuronal differentiation of the PC12 cells induced by the nerve growth factor (NGF).",M2
11021811,"Enhancement of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis by the HIV-1 <e>tat</e> gene.The human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein is suspected to be involved in the neoplastic pathology arising in AIDS patients. tat-transgenic (TT) mice, which constitutively express Tat in the liver, develop liver cell dysplasia (LCD) that may represent a preneoplastic lesion. To test if TT mice are predisposed to liver carcinogenesis, we treated them with diethylnitrosamine, a hepatotropic carcinogen. Diethylnitrosamine-treated TT mice developed both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver. They showed an enhancement of LCD and developed basophilic liver cell nodules (BLCN), hepatocellular adenomas (HA), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HC). Both preneoplastic (LCD and BLCN) and neoplastic (HA and HC) lesions were significantly more frequent in TT than in control mice: 29.7% versus 12.7% for LCD, 57.9% versus 23.3% for BLCN, 40.6% versus 10.0% for HA, and 50.0% versus 12.7% for HC. These results indicate that Tat expression in the liver predisposes to both initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis and to malignant progression of liver tumors. This study supports a role for Tat in enhancing the effect of endogenous and exogenous carcinogens in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis in the course of AIDS.",M2
10982343,"Characterization of a major histocompatibility complex class II X-box-binding protein enhancing <e>tat</e>-induced transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.The X-box element present within the promoter region of genes belonging to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a pivotal role in the expression of class II molecules, since it contains the binding sites for several well-characterized transcription factors. We have analyzed a randomly selected compilation of viral genomes for the presence of elements homologous to the X box of the HLA-DRA gene. We found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shows the highest frequency of X-like box elements per 1,000 bases of genome. Within the HIV-1 genome, we found an X-like motif in the TAR region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), a regulative region playing a pivotal role in Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription. The use of a decoy approach for nuclear proteins binding to this element, namely, XMAS (X-like motif activator sequence), performed by transfection of multiple copies of this sequence into cells carrying an integrated LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct, suggests that this element binds to nuclear proteins that enhance Tat-induced transcription. In this report we have characterized two proteins, one binding to the XMAS motif and the other to the flanking regions of XMAS. Mobility shift assays performed on crude nuclear extracts or enriched fractions suggest that similar proteins bind to XMAS from HIV-1 and the X box of the HLA-DRA gene. Furthermore, a UV cross-linking assay suggests that one protein of 47 kDa, termed FAX (factor associated with XMAS)-1, binds to the XMAS of HIV-1. The other protein of 56 kDa was termed FAX-2. In a decoy ex vivo experiment, it was found that sequences recognizing both proteins are required to inhibit Tat-induced HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription. Taken together, the data reported in this paper suggest that XMAS and nearby sequences modulate Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription by binding to the X-box-binding proteins FAX-1 and FAX-2. The sequence homology between XMAS and X box is reflected in binding of a common protein, FAX-1, and similar functional roles in gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that transcription factors binding to the X box of the MHC class II genes enhance the transcription of HIV-1.",M2
10930666,"Mutations occurring during serial passage of Japanese equine infectious anemia virus in primary horse macrophages.An attenuated equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), named V26, was previously obtained after 50 passages of the Japanese virulent strain V70 in primary macrophage culture. To clarify the differences between both viruses, their full-length sequences were determined. There were higher mutations in S2 (6.15% amino acid difference) and LTR (10.7% nucleotide difference). The presumed initiation codon of the S2 gene was absent from the sequence of V26. There was a large insertion within the long-terminal repeat (LTR) U3 hypervariable region of V26. In addition, there were minor mutations in gag (1.22% amino acid difference), pol (1.05% amino acid difference) and env (1. 65% amino acid difference) regions, but no mutation in <e>tat</e> region. No mutations were observed in the principal neutralizing domain in the gp90. Thus, the mutations in the S2 and LTR might be the major target sites of mutation in EIAV during serial passages in vitro.",M2
10915601,"LuSIV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HIV and SIV replication.A single cycle of viral replication is the time required for a virus to enter the host cell, replicate its genome, and produce infectious progeny virions. The primate lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), require on average 24 h to complete one cycle of replication. We have now developed and characterized a reporter assay system in CEMx174 cells for the quantitative measurement of HIV/SIV infection within a single replication cycle. The SIV(mac)239 LTR (-225 --&gt; +149) was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and this reporter plasmid is maintained in CEMx174 cells under stable selection. This cell line, designated LuSIV, is highly sensitive to infection by primary and laboratory strains of HIV/SIV, resulting in <e>Tat</e>-mediated expression of luciferase, which correlates with viral infectivity. Furthermore, manipulation of LuSIV cells for the detection of luciferase activity is easy to perform and requires a minimal amount of time as compared to current HIV/SIV detection systems. The LuSIV system is a powerful tool for the analysis of HIV/SIV infection that provides a unique assay system that can detect virus replication prior to 24 h and does not require virus to spread from cell to cell. Thus these cells can be used for the study of replication-deficient viruses and the high throughput screening of antivirals, or other inhibitors of infection.",M2
10763745,"Heat-inducible vectors for use in gene therapy.The objectives of this study were to quantity and compare the activities of a minimal heat shock (HS) promoter and other promoters used in gene therapy applications, and to identify strategies to amplify the heat inducibility of therapeutic genes. Human tumour cells were transiently or stably transfected with the HS promoter driving expression of reporter genes. HS promoter activity was induced transiently, with maximum activity 16-24 h after HS, and was dependent on temperature. The activity of the minimal HS promoter was similar, after 42 degrees C HS for 1 h, to that of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To determine if the HS promoter could be used to activate a second conditional promoter, cells were transiently transfected with vectors containing both the HS and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) promoters. When the IL-2 gene was placed downstream of the HIV1 promoter. IL-2 production was temperature-independent. The addition of the HIV <e>tat</e> gene downstream of the HS promoter caused IL-2 to be induced more than 3 fold after a single 42 degrees C HS. These data indicate that the minimal HS promoter, following activation by clinically attainable temperatures (&lt; or = 42 degrees C), can drive expression of therapeutic genes at levels comparable to the CMV promoter and be used in conjunction with a second conditional promoter to drive temperature-dependent, gene expression.",M2
10694813,"Inhibition of HIV-1 replication in chronically infected cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by retrovirus-mediated antitat gene transfer.Among potential genetic targets for intervention in the HIV-1 life cycle, the <e>tat</e> gene product is a key target. We investigated the ability of an antitat gene to inhibit HIV-1 activation and replication in chronically infected promonocyte (U1) and T cell (ACH-2) lines in vitro. U1 and ACH-2 cells were transduced with an antitat gene expressing RNA with dual (polymeric Tat activation response element and antisense-tat) function that interferes with HIV-1 replication. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plus phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced HIV-1 expression, as determined by reverse transcribed PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, was significantly inhibited in U1 and ACH-2 cells transduced with the antitat gene, compared with the cells transduced with control vector and untransduced cells. This resistance to TNF-alpha plus PMA-induced HIV-1 expression was demonstrated in antitat gene-transduced U1 and ACH-2 cells maintained in G418-free media for 5 months, suggesting that functional antitat gene may persist for many months in transduced cells and their progeny. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the antitat gene, when introduced into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with HIV-1 infection, inhibited TNF-alpha plus PMA-induced viral replication as determined by RT-PCR and RT activity. In addition, the antitat gene enhanced the survival of CD4+ T lymphocytes from such patients. These data suggest the feasibility of utilizing antitat gene therapy to block activation and replication of HIV-1 in latently infected monocytes and T- lymphocytes in vivo.

10556549,"Enhancement of antibody responses by DNA immunization using expression vectors mediating efficient antigen secretion.The immune responses elicited in mice, after intradermal (i.d.) immunization with plasmids encoding secreted or intracellular forms of HIV-1 nef, HIV-1 <e>tat</e> or C. pneumoniae omp2 proteins, respectively, were compared. To mediate secretion of these proteins the genes were fused to a heterologous signal sequence from murine heavy chain IgG. The nef- and omp2-specific antibody responses were dramatically increased when mice were inoculated with the plasmid encoding the secreted form of these proteins. In contrast, HIV-1 tat comprising an internal strong nuclear targeting sequence could not be induced to secretion and subsequently no enhanced antibody response was observed. Slight improvement of the HIV-1 nef antibody response was achieved after co-inoculation with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression vector. Further, nef-specific T-cell responses were induced after nef DNA injections, and were of Th1-like phenotype regardless of whether the nef protein was secreted or not. The system described in this study, using a plasmid vector with a strong heterologous signal sequence that mediate efficient antigen secretion in vivo, may have wide applicability for the induction of high antibody levels to normally non-secreted antigens.",M2
10381523,"Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus-<e>Tat</e> gene in lymphoid tissues of transgenic mice is associated with B-cell lymphoma.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat gene, a potent transactivator of viral and cellular genes, has been proposed as a key agent in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome related disorders, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In cultured cells, the HIV-1 Tat protein can induce the expression of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, which are known to induce proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells. Such alterations in cytokine expression, together with a secondary genetic event, are thought to ultimately lead to oncogenic transformation. To address the influence of Tat on lymphoid development in the context of the whole organism, we produced several transgenic mouse lines that express the Tat gene under the control of an actin promoter. We show here that this promoter directs expression to a variety of sites, including spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Approximately 25% to 30% of the Tat-transgenic population developed enlarged spleens within 1 year after birth. On histological examination, a significant number of spleens from Tat-transgenic mice exhibited malignant lymphoma of B-cell origin. IgG heavy chain rearrangement confirmed the clonal B-cell nature of these lymphoproliferations. In contrast, T-cell receptor genes exhibited a germline (unrearranged) structure. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of transgenic spleens revealed that mRNA encoding cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 was upregulated, suggesting a possible mechanism for the B-cell expansion in vivo.",M2
10352935,"Y chromosomal polymorphisms reveal founding lineages in the Finns and the Saami.Y chromosomal polymorphisms were studied in 502 males from 16 Eurasian ethnic groups including the Finns, Saami (Inari Lake area and Skolt Saami), Karelians, Mari, Mokshas, Erzas, Hungarians (Budapest area and Csángós), Khanty, Mansi, Yakuts, Koryaks, Nivkhs, Mongolians, and Latvians. The samples were analysed for polymorphisms in the Y chromosome specific Alu insertion (YAP) and six microsatellites (DYS19, DYS389-I and II, DYS390, DYS392, DYS393). The populations were also screened for the recently described <e>Tat</e> polymorphism. The incidence of YAP+ type was highest in the Csángós and in other Hungarians (37.5% and 17.5%, respectively). In the Karelians and the Latvians it was present at approximately the same level as commonly found in other European populations, whilst absent in our further samples of Eurasian populations, including the Finns and the Saami. Aside from the Hungarians, the C allele of the Tat polymorphism was common in all the Finno-Ugric speaking populations (from 8.2% to 63.2%), with highest incidence in the Ob-Ugrian Khanty. The C allele was also found in the Latvians (29.4%). The haplotypes found associated with the Tat C allele showed consistently lower density than those associated with the T allele, indicating that the T allele is the original form. The computation of the age of the Tat C suggested that the mutation might be a relatively recent event giving a maximum likelihood estimate of 4440 years (95% confidence interval about 3140-6200 years). The distribution patterns of the 222 haplotypes found varied considerably among the populations. In the Finns a majority of the haplotypes could be assigned to two distinct groups, one of which harboured the C allele of the Tat polymorphism, indicating dichotomous primary source of genetic variation among Finnish males. The presence of a bottleneck or founding effect in the male lineages of some of the populations, namely in the Finns and the Saami, would appear to be one likely interpretation for these findings.",M2
9847371,"Characterization of the Jembrana disease virus <e>tat</e> gene and the cis- and trans-regulatory elements in its long terminal repeats.Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a newly identified bovine lentivirus that is closely related to the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). JDV contains a tat gene, encoded by two exons, which has potent transactivation activity. Cotransfection of the JDV tat expression plasmid with the JDV promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct pJDV-U3R resulted in a substantial increase in the level of CAT mRNA transcribed from the JDV long terminal repeat (LTR) and a dramatic increase in the CAT protein level. Deletion analysis of the LTR sequences showed that sequences spanning nucleotides -68 to +53, including the TATA box and the predicted first stem-loop structure of the predicted Tat response element (TAR), were required for efficient transactivation. The results, derived from site-directed mutagenesis experiments, suggested that the base pairing in the stem of the first stem-loop structure in the TAR region was important for JDV Tat-mediated transactivation; in contrast, nucleotide substitutions in the loop region of JDV TAR had less effect. For the JDV LTR, upstream sequences, from nucleotide -196 and beyond, as well as the predicted secondary structures in the R region, may have a negative effect on basal JDV promoter activity. Deletion of these regions resulted in a four- to fivefold increase in basal expression. The JDV Tat is also a potent transactivator of other animal and primate lentivirus promoters. It transactivated BIV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTRs to levels similar to those with their homologous Tat proteins. In contrast, HIV-1 Tat has minimal effects on JDV LTR expression, whereas BIV Tat moderately transactivated the JDV LTR. Our study suggests that JDV may use a mechanism of transactivation similar but not identical to those of other animal and primate lentiviruses.",M2
9765432,"High-titer human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based vector systems for gene delivery into nondividing cells.Previously we designed novel pseudotyped high-titer replication defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors to deliver genes into nondividing cells (J. Reiser, G. Harmison, S. Kluepfel-Stahl, R. O. Brady, S. Karlsson, and M. Schubert, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:15266-15271, 1996). Since then we have made several improvements with respect to the safety, flexibility, and efficiency of the vector system. A three-plasmid expression system is used to generate pseudotyped HIV-1 particles by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with a defective packaging construct, a plasmid coding for a heterologous envelope (Env) protein, and a vector construct harboring a reporter gene such as neo, ShlacZ (encoding a phleomycin resistance/beta-galactosidase fusion protein), HSA (encoding mouse heat-stable antigen), or EGFP (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein). The packaging constructs lack functional Vif, Vpr, and Vpu proteins and/or a large portion of the Env coding region as well as the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats, the Nef function, and the presumed packaging signal. Using G418 selection, we routinely obtained vector particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) with titers of up to 8 x 10(7) CFU/microgram of p24, provided that a functional <e>Tat</e> coding region was present in the vector. Vector constructs lacking a functional Tat protein yielded titers of around 4 x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6) CFU/microgram of p24. Packaging constructs with a mutation within the integrase (IN) core domain profoundly affected colony formation and expression of the reporter genes, indicating that a functional IN protein is required for efficient transduction. We explored the abilities of other Env proteins to allow formation of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles. The rabies virus and Mokola virus G proteins yielded high-titer infectious pseudotypes, while the human foamy virus Env protein did not. Using the improved vector system, we successfully transduced contact-inhibited primary human skin fibroblasts and postmitotic rat cerebellar neurons and cardiac myocytes, a process not affected by the lack of the accessory proteins.",M2
9765382,"A third-generation lentivirus vector with a conditional packaging system.Vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are highly efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery. However, their biosafety is of major concern. Here we exploit the complexity of the HIV genome to provide lentivirus vectors with novel biosafety features. In addition to the structural genes, HIV contains two regulatory genes, <e>tat</e> and rev, that are essential for HIV replication, and four accessory genes that encode critical virulence factors. We previously reported that the HIV type 1 accessory open reading frames are dispensable for efficient gene transduction by a lentivirus vector. We now demonstrate that the requirement for the tat gene can be offset by placing constitutive promoters upstream of the vector transcript. Vectors generated from constructs containing such a chimeric long terminal repeat (LTR) transduced neurons in vivo at very high efficiency, whether or not they were produced in the presence of Tat. When the rev gene was also deleted from the packaging construct, expression of gag and pol was strictly dependent on Rev complementation in trans. By the combined use of a separate nonoverlapping Rev expression plasmid and a 5' LTR chimeric transfer construct, we achieved optimal yields of vector of high transducing efficiency (up to 10(7) transducing units [TU]/ml and 10(4) TU/ng of p24). This third-generation lentivirus vector uses only a fractional set of HIV genes: gag, pol, and rev. Moreover, the HIV-derived constructs, and any recombinant between them, are contingent on upstream elements and trans complementation for expression and thus are nonfunctional outside of the vector producer cells. This split-genome, conditional packaging system is based on existing viral sequences and acts as a built-in device against the generation of productive recombinants. While the actual biosafety of the vector will ultimately be proven in vivo, the improved design presented here should facilitate testing of lentivirus vectors.",M2
9718130,"Brain-derived HIV-1 <e>tat</e> sequences from AIDS patients with dementia show increased molecular heterogeneity.HIV-1 infection results in a dementing illness affecting 20% of patients with AIDS. Several HIV-1 genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-induced neurological disease. To search for distinct HIV-1 sequences associated with the development of dementia, brain-derived tat, env, and pol sequences were examined from AIDS patients defined pre-mortem as demented (HIV-D)[n=5] or non-demented (HIV-ND)[n=5]. Estimations of evolutionary distances and frequency of non-synonymous mutation rates revealed significant differences between brain-derived tat, env, and pol-encoded reverse transcriptase sequences. However, established zidovudine-associated resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase sequences were identified in only one HIV-D and one HIV-ND patient despite prolonged treatment of some patients. Non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates among the tat sequences derived from patients with HIV-D were significantly higher compared to the HIV-ND group (P &lt; 0.001). The ratios of transversions to transitions were also significantly higher among the HIV-D tat sequences (P&lt; 0.01). Phylogenetic analyses showed clustering of sequences from each clinical group among the brain-derived tat and env sequences. These studies indicated that differing selective forces act on individual HIV-1 genes in the brain which may influence the development of dementia.",M2

Inhibition of the replication of HIV-1 IIIB and primary drug-resistant strains in pooled transduced CEMT4 cells was consistently found to be more than 80% compared with the control-vector transduced cells, whereas a mutant RRz2 gave approximately 45% inhibition. A multiple HIV-1 passage assay showed the absence of emergence of mutations within the specific viral RNA ribozyme target sequences. This lack of generation of ribozyme  escape mutants  occurred despite the almost complete disappearance of a HIV-1 quasi-species in the testing virus. When RRz2 was tested in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from HIV-1-infected patients, paired analysis showed that cell viability in the ribozyme-transduced HIV-1-infected PBLs was significantly higher than that in the vector-transduced cells. This difference in viability (vector versus RRz2) was not observed in PBLs from non-HIV-1-infected donors. Taken together, these results indicate that the transfer of an anti-HIV-1 ribozyme gene into human T lymphocytes could have major impact on viral replication and T cell viability in the HIV-1-infected individual.",M2

Two factors essential for DRB action have recently been identified. These factors, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), positively and negatively regulate pol II elongation, and are likely to be relevant to the function of Tat.

9520165,"Human cytomegalovirus product UL44 downregulates the transactivation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat.OBJECTIVE: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is often isolated from HIV-1-infected patients and the two viruses can infect the same cell type giving rise to direct bidirectional interactions. Whereas the long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation ability of HCMV immediate early gene (IE1/IE2) is well documented, no information is available on the possible role of other HCMV proteins. In this study, the activity of ppUL44, an early DNA-binding protein, on HIV LTR transactivation was investigated. METHODS: HIV LTR transactivation by ppUL44 in presence or absence of HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> and HCMV IE1/IE2 was determined in J-Jhan and U973 cells through transient transfection experiments with a series of different expression vectors. Some experiments were also performed on U373-MG astrocytoma cells permanently transfected with UL44 or with another HCMV gene used as a control (UL55). RESULTS: The basal transactivation activity of the HIV LTR was not influenced by the presence of ppUL44. On the contrary, the transactivation observed in the presence of Tat, IE1/IE2 or both factors in synergy was strongly downregulated by ppUL44 in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion constructs of ppUL44 demonstrated that the region of the molecule responsible for the inhibition of the LTR is located within the last 114 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal region. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicate that within the last 114 amino acids of ppUL44 there is a domain that has a negative effect on the ability of HIV-1 LTR to be activated by both its autologous transactivator Tat and the heterologous transactivator HCMV IE1/IE2 functioning individually or synergistically.",M2
9514931,"Interaction of the second coding exon of <e>Tat</e> with human EF-1 delta delineates a mechanism for HIV-1-mediated shut-off of host mRNA translation.HIV-1 Tat has pleiotropic functions. While its most studied role is to activate transcription from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter, Tat also has functions as a secretable growth factor, a T-cell activator, and an inducer of cellular apoptosis, amongst others. For its transcriptional function, the first coding exon of Tat appears wholly sufficient; however, lentiviruses (HIVs and SIVs) maintain and conserve a second coding exon for Tat. While the function(s) of the second exon of Tat has remained largely unknown, its integrity in lentiviral genomes suggests biological importance, possibly a role in non-transcriptional activities. To understand better the biology of the second exon of Tat in HIV-1 infection of cells, we have searched for cellular proteins that bind specifically to this protein domain. Here, we report that the human translation elongation factor 1-delta (EF-1 delta) binds to the second exon of HIV-1 Tat. Interaction between Tat and EF-1 delta dramatically reduces the efficiency of the translation of cellular, but not viral, mRNAs. These findings suggest that a non-transcriptional activity of Tat modulates cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells.",M2

An enzyme-linked oligosorbent assay (ELOSA) in microtiter plates is described, for the detection of PCR products, the sensitivity of which was shown to be comparable to that of membrane hybridization detection. Serological response of the animals against the BIV p26 protein was shown, using a recombinant fusion protein ((His)6p26) expressed in E. coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, in ELISA and Western blot studies.

9472557,"Development of replicative and nonreplicative hepatitis B virus vectors.To investigate the possibility of using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a vector, the <e>tat</e> gene from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was inserted into the full-length HBV genome in-frame with the polymerase (pol) open reading frame in the tether region and downstream of the preS1 promoter. We demonstrated that the tat gene was expressed with full activity in transactivating the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). The expression of the tat gene in the context of the HBV genome in chicken hepatoma and human cervical carcinoma cells, however, was not as efficient as that in human hepatoblastoma cells, which reflects the cellular and species specificity of promoters of hepadnaviruses. Detection of RNA expressed from this HBVtat recombinant revealed transcription of the tat gene by two promoters: the core/pol promoter and the preS1 promoter. A Pol-Tat fusion protein expressed by the core/pol promoter did not seem to contribute to the tat transactivation activity of the HBVtat recombinant since a frameshift mutation in the pol gene did not affect the recombinant tat function. The functional tat protein, therefore, was most likely expressed as a Tat-Pol fusion product. Endogenous polymerase assays showed that the pol protein expressed from the HBVtat recombinant was still active although at a reduced level. Hepatitis B surface antigens and e antigen produced from this recombinant were detected at similar levels as those produced from the wild type. Notably, the capability of forming complete HBV particles was still retained. These studies indicate the potential of constructing HBV as a replicative vector. We also showed that manipulation of a nonreplicative HBV vector was possible. Expression of the HBV polymerase could be completely eliminated and replication of the nonreplicative HBV recombinant could be supported by Pol transcomplementation.",M2

The development was disturbed and adenocarcinomas of the lacrimal glands and pancreas appeared in transgenic mice carrying the HIV-1 tat gene. Transfection with the tat gene altered morphology and increased proliferative activity of Rat-2 pseudonormal cells. The tat gene also induced the formation of neoplastic foci in a primary rat embryo fibroblast culture. The results obtained showed that the HIV-1 tat gene can act as an oncogene and activate the proliferation of cultured cells. Cell proportions in peripheral blood and bone marrow were altered and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation was decreased in transgenic mice carrying the HIV-1 nef gene. This gene also significantly suppressed proliferation but had no effect on morphology of Rat-2 cells. Thus, the HIV-1 nef gene appeared to suppress proliferation of various animal cells.",M2
9445075,"Mutations in the <e>tat</e> gene are responsible for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 postintegration latency in the U1 cell line.Previous reports have demonstrated that the U1 cell line, a model for postintegration latency, is defective at the level of Tat function and can be rescued by exogenously provided Tat protein. Sequence analysis of tat cDNAs from the U1 cell line identified two distinct forms of Tat, in agreement with the fact that this cell line contains two integrated human immunodeficiency (HIV) proviruses. One Tat cDNA lacked an ATG initiation codon, while the other contained an H-to-L mutation at amino acid 13 (H13--&gt;L). Both tat cDNAs were defective in terms of transcriptional activation of long terminal repeat-luciferase reporter gene in transient-transfection experiments. Introduction of the H13--&gt;L mutation in a wild-type tat background caused a severe reduction in transcriptional activation. Introduction of the same mutation in an infectious HIV molecular clone caused a severely defective phenotype which could be rescued when the HIV proviral DNA was transfected in a Jurkat cell line stably expressing the Tat protein (Jurkat-Tat) or in Jurkat cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha. Infectious virus stocks generated in Jurkat-Tat cells were used to infect Jurkat cells and exhibited severely impaired growth which could also be rescued by infecting Jurkat-Tat cells. These observations define tat mutations as a mechanism for HIV postintegration latency.",M2

In vitro, such mAbs do not inhibit virus to cell fusion but are able to inhibit virus envelope-mediated syncytia formation. Moreover, these mAbs inhibit <e>Tat</e>-induced activation of HIV-1 promoter and HIV-1 transcription in infected CD4+ cells. Here, we report the selection of escaped mutant virus or viruses derived from HIV-1Lai capable of replicating in vitro in the presence of concentrations of 13B8-2 mAb, that usually inhibit HIV-1Lai particle production. The escaped mutant virus or viruses, termed HIV-1Lai13EM, kept the major enzymatic restriction sites found in HIV-1Lai and remained sensitive to anti-CD4 mAb-, soluble CD4-, and recombinant gp120-mediated inhibition of syncytia formation. Possible genetic changes affecting the tat gene or the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) were investigated. Partial sequence analysis of HIV-1Lai13EM and a control HIV-1Lai grown for 85 days in CEM cells, demonstrated that the first tat exon of these two viruses encoded identical proteins. Although a point mutation G&gt;A was frequently encountered (6 of 13 sequences) in the LTRs of HIV-1Lai13EM at position -188 within the negative regulatory element (NRE), this mutation did not confer the escape mutant phenotype. Our study indicates that the mutant phenotype probably requires genetic changes in a region or regions outside the LTRs.",M2
9311879,"Neutralization sensitivity of cell culture-passaged simian immunodeficiency virus.CEMx174- and C8166-45-based cell lines which contain a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene under the control of a <e>tat</e>-responsive promoter derived from either SIVmac239 or HIV-1(NL4-3) were constructed. Basal levels of SEAP activity from these cell lines were low but were greatly stimulated upon transfection of tat expression plasmids. Infection of these cell lines with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resulted in a dramatic increase in SEAP production within 48 to 72 h that directly correlated with the amount of infecting virus. When combined with chemiluminescent measurement of SEAP activity in the cell-free supernatant, these cells formed the basis of a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative assay for SIV and HIV infectivity and neutralization. Eight of eight primary isolates of HIV-1 that were tested induced readily measurable SEAP activity in this system. While serum neutralization of cloned SIVmac239 was difficult to detect with other assays, neutralization of SIVmac239 was readily detected at low titers with this new assay system. The neutralization sensitivities of two stocks of SIVmac251 with different cell culture passage histories were tested by using sera from SIV-infected monkeys. The primary stock of SIVmac251 had been passaged only twice through primary cultures of rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while the laboratory-adapted stock had been extensively passaged through the MT4 immortalized T-cell line. The primary stock of SIVmac251 was much more resistant to neutralization by a battery of polyclonal sera from SIV-infected monkeys than was the laboratory-adapted virus. Thus, SIVmac appears to be similar to HIV-1 in that extensive laboratory passage through T-cell lines resulted in a virus that is much more sensitive to serum neutralization.",M2

Deletion of the majority of intron sequences, containing previously identified CRS, did not attenuate CRS activity. Retention of either the first or second <e>tat</e> intron preserved CRS activity. RNAs containing splice donor sequences, in the absence of known downstream splice acceptor sequences, retained CRS activity. Unexpectedly, these splice donors were still utilized for splicing. These results indicate that the major HIV-1 splice donors can function as CRS and function to negatively regulate the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 RNAs in COS cells.",M2
9261187,"Translation of an uncapped mRNA involves scanning.<e>tat</e>, an essential gene of human immunodeficiency virus, when placed under the control of the RNA polymerase III promoter from the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene, is transcribed into an uncapped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA. This VA-Tat RNA is translated to produce functional Tat protein in transfected mammalian cells (Gunnery, S., and Mathews, M. B. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 3597-3607). The presence of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) in VA-Tat RNA is inhibitory to the translation of the Tat ORF, suggesting that the RNA is scanned during translation even though it is uncapped. Because the effect of the upstream ORF is relatively small (about 2-fold), we sought more definitive evidence of scanning by introducing secondary structures of varying stabilities into the 5'-untranslated region of VA-Tat RNA. The results of transfection experiments showed that highly stable secondary structure was inhibitory to Tat synthesis, whereas structures of lower stability were not inhibitory, confirming that uncapped mRNA is subject to scanning. Furthermore, translation of the downstream ORF was reduced but not eliminated by mutations that caused the upstream ORF to overlap the Tat ORF. Extending the overlap of the two ORFs further decreased the translation of the downstream ORF. This observation implies that ribosomes reinitiate after termination, possibly after migrating in a 3' to 5' direction through the overlap region of the mRNA. Similar results were obtained with a capped polymerase II transcript, indicating that the translation of polymerase II and polymerase III transcripts occurs through similar mechanisms.",M2
9266985,"Kinetics of viral RNA synthesis following cell-to-cell transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.The temporal appearance and levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) <e>tat</e>, rev, nef, env and gag mRNA species were examined using a synchronized, one-step, cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection model involving HUT-78 cells and HIV- 1 persistently infected H3B cells. Individual mRNAs were quantified by RT-PCR using RNA standards transcribed in vitro from cDNA clones. Consistent with an infection that produces high yields of virus, significant levels of env and gag mRNAs were detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells late in the infection cycle. However, at no time after infection did levels of tat, rev and nef mRNA, which encode the regulatory proteins of HIV-1, exceed their levels present in the persistently infected virus donor H3B cells. The absence of early phase induction of these mRNAs is in contrast to what is observed in cell-free HIV-1 infections or in PMA-stimulated HIV-1 chronically infected cell lines. Our results suggest that tat and rev mRNAs are already present in the cytoplasm of the persistently infected virus donor cells at levels sufficient for initiation and establishment of a highly productive infection in HIV-1 fusion-mediated infected cells. Thus, lack of sufficient Tat and Rev proteins is not likely to be the limiting factor for virus production in H3B cells, nor is increased production of these proteins likely to be the cause of the increased virus production seen following cell-to-cell transmission.",M2
9191845,"Activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter/TAR regions and tat1 genes derived from individuals with different rates of disease progression.Different rates of disease progression may be associated with different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter and/or transactivator activities. We therefore analyzed the sequences and activities of the first exon of <e>Tat</e>, tat1, and the promoter/trans-acting responsive (TAR) regions amplified directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from five long-term nonprogressors and eight progressing HIV-1-infected individuals. The majority of tat1 alleles and promoter/TAR regions from all patients were intact and showed comparable activities in transient reporter assays. A substantial number of point mutations and some length variations were observed in the promoter/TAR region. In a single nonprogressor, the Sp1 binding site 3 was consistently altered and the transcriptional activity in the presence of Tat was diminished. Some LTR clones from a rapid progressor contained a fourth Sp1 binding site, which was associated with an elevated basal promoter activity. These data suggest that defects in the promoter/TAR region or tat1 are rare and that different promoter/transactivator activities are not commonly associated with different progression rates.",M2
9176513,"Studies on the effect of the combined expression of anti-<e>tat</e> and anti-rev genes on HIV-1 replication.A series of retroviral vectors with potential anti-tat and antirev activity was developed. Vectors containing a tat transdominant negative mutant (tat22/37) and an RRE decoy in different positions, directed by the same promoter or by different promoters, were generated. Retroviral vectors containing tat22/37 and the RevM10 transdominant negative mutant were also constructed. Jurkat cells were transduced with the recombinant retroviruses to produce monoclonal and polyclonal cultures. In these cell lines the recombinant proviruses were correctly integrated and expression of the inserted genes was detected by Northern blot or RT-PCR analysis. However, infection of these cell lines with HIV-1 showed that none of these recombinant constructs inhibited virus replication at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). At a low MOI, two cell clones containing tat22/37 and the RRE decoy in 3' position showed a long lasting protection against virus replication, in comparison to control cultures expressing tat22/37 or RRE alone. Combination of tat and rev mutants was ineffective in inhibiting HIV-1 replication at both low and high MOIs. At a low MOI, HIV-1 replication was efficiently blocked in two cell clones expressing the RevM10 mutant alone. These results show a synergic effect of anti-tat and anti-rev molecules when the RRE sequence is cloned 3' to tat22/37, suggesting the possibility of using this vector design to control HIV-1 replication.",M2
20149443,"PEG-PLA microparticles for encapsulation and delivery of <e>Tat</e>-EGFP to retinal cells.The efficient and controlled delivery of genes and proteins to retinal cells remains a challenge. In this study, we evaluated polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) microparticles for encapsulation and delivery of a Transactivator of transcription-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion (Tat-EGFP) to retinal cells. Our main objective was to develop a microparticle system that delivers Tat-EGFP with an initial rapid release (within 24 h) followed by a sustained release. We prepared four different formulations of Tat-EGFP encapsulated PEG-PLA particles to investigate the effects of protein and polymer concentrations on particle morphology and protein release, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorometry techniques. The optimum formulation was selected based on higher protein release, and smaller particle size. The optimum formulation was then tested in vitro for cell biocompatibility and protein internalization, and in vivo for cellular toxicity following sub-retinal injections into rat eyes. The results suggest that PEG-PLA microparticles can deliver proteins in cell culture allowing protein internalization in as little as 1 h. In vivo, protein was shown to localize within the photoreceptor layer of the retina, and persist for at least 9 weeks with no observed toxicity.",M3

After cellular uptake of the Tat-QDs conjugates, the micro-PL spectrum of Tat-QDs in lysosomes showed a spectral blueshift, which was most probably due to the fact that Tat peptide was digested by the enzymes, leaving the Tat-detached QDs in lysosomes. The reasons for the spectral changes have been discussed in detail.",M3
20060860,"Improved <e>Tat</e>-mediated plasmid DNA transfer by fusion to LK15 peptide.The use of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as Tat-derived peptide, to deliver DNA into cells is limited as evidenced by the low transfection efficiency of their DNA complexes. Here, we demonstrate that covalent attachment of membrane active peptide LK15 to Tat peptide improves gene transfer. Our results demonstrate that Tat peptide was able to form complexes with DNA, but their transfection efficiency was insufficient as assessed by luciferase assay. The attachment of LK15 to Tat significantly improved the physiochemical properties of the DNA complexes, rendered the complexes membrane active and enhanced the gene expression in HT29 and in HT1080 cultured cells. The enhanced transfection ability of Tat-LK15 compared to Tat is likely to be due mainly to the higher uptake of DNA. Finally, we evaluated the penetration and transfection ability of Tat and Tat-LK15 in multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTS) to mimic in vivo delivery to tumours. The results showed that the penetration and transfection ability of Tat and Tat-LK15/DNA complexes were limited to the rim of HT29 spheroids. Taken together, our data shows improvement in the transfection efficiency of Tat peptide by covalent attachment to LK15. Further advancements are needed before any potential applications in tissues as the penetration into the core of MCTS remains severely restricted.",M3
20038937,"Engineering cell-permeable protein.The protein transduction technique enables the direct delivery of biologically active material into mammalian cells [for review see (1,2)]. For this one can make use of the translocating ability of so-called cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), also designated as protein transduction domains (PTDs). The <e>TAT</e>-CPP derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat (trans-activator of transcription) protein has been widely used. The positively charged TAT promotes cell permeability thereby overcoming the barriers of the cellular membrane by endocytosis or/and direct membrane penetration(2). In combination with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) fusion proteins are able to enter the nucleus exhibiting functionality. Our video presentation demonstrates, as an exemplification for the engineering of cell-permeable proteins, the construction, production and application of a cell-permeable version of the DNA-modifying enzyme Cre. Cre is a site-specific recombinase that is able to recognize and recombine 34 base pair loxP sites in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore the Cre/loxP system is widely used to conditionally induce mutations in the genome of living cells(3,4). The delivery of active Cre recombinase to cells, however, represents a limitation. We describe the pSESAME vector system, which allows a direct insertion of the gene-of-interest and provides a platform to rapidly clone different domains and tags used within the vector in a convenient and standardized manner. Rearranging of the different tags has been shown to modify the biochemical properties of the fusion proteins providing a possibility to achieve higher yield and better solubility. We demonstrate how to express and purify recombinant cell-permeant proteins in and from E. coli. The functionality of the recombinant Cre protein is finally validated in cell culture by assessing its intracellular recombinase activity.",M3
19901984,"Potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication by a <e>Tat</e> mutant.Herein we describe a mutant of the two-exon HIV-1 Tat protein, termed Nullbasic, that potently inhibits multiple steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Nullbasic was created by replacing the entire arginine-rich basic domain of wild type Tat with glycine/alanine residues. Like similarly mutated one-exon Tat mutants, Nullbasic exhibited transdominant negative effects on Tat-dependent transactivation. However, unlike previously reported mutants, we discovered that Nullbasic also strongly suppressed the expression of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA, an activity likely caused by redistribution and thus functional inhibition of HIV-1 Rev. Furthermore, HIV-1 virion particles produced by cells expressing Nullbasic had severely reduced infectivity, a defect attributable to a reduced ability of the virions to undergo reverse transcription. Combination of these inhibitory effects on transactivation, Rev-dependent mRNA transport and reverse transcription meant that permissive cells constitutively expressing Nullbasic were highly resistant to a spreading infection by HIV-1. Nullbasic and its activities thus provide potential insights into the development of potent antiviral therapeutics that target multiple stages of HIV-1 infection.",M3
19900276,"A new synthetic protein, <e>TAT</e>-RH, inhibits tumor growth through the regulation of NFkappaB activity.BACKGROUND: Based on its role in angiogenesis and apoptosis, the inhibition of NFkappaB activity is considered an effective treatment for cancer, hampered by the lack of selective and safe inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that the RH domain of GRK5 (GRK5-RH) inhibits NFkappaB, thus we evaluated its effects on cancer growth. METHODS: The role of GRK5-RH on tumor growth was assessed in a human cancer cell line (KAT-4). RH overexpression was induced by adenovirus mediated gene transfer; alternatively we administered a synthetic protein reproducing the RH domain of GRK5 (TAT-RH), actively transported into the cells. RESULTS: In vitro, adenovirus mediated GRK5-RH overexpression (AdGRK5-NT) in human tumor cells (KAT-4) induces IkappaB accumulation and inhibits NFkappaB transcriptional activity leading to apoptotic events. In BALB/c nude mice harboring KAT-4 induced neoplasias, intra-tumor delivery of AdGRK5-NT reduces in a dose-dependent fashion tumor growth, with the highest doses completely inhibiting it. This phenomenon is paralleled by a decrease of NFkappaB activity, an increase of IkappaB levels and apoptotic events. To move towards a pharmacological setup, we synthesized the TAT-RH protein. In cultured KAT-4 cells, different dosages of TAT-RH reduced cell survival and increased apoptosis. In BALB/c mice, the anti-proliferative effects of TAT-RH appear to be dose-dependent and highest dose completely inhibits tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that GRK5-RH inhibition of NFkappaB is a novel and effective anti-tumoral strategy and TAT-RH could be an useful tool in the fighting of cancer.",M3
19881308,"Preparation of an artificial cell cycle progressor with a novel mechanism.Control of cell cycle progression in somatic cells or terminally differentiated cells is a key technology for cell-based therapies such as regenerative therapy. We have prepared an artificial cell cycle progression peptide composed of a human immunodeficiency virus-derived <e>Tat</e> protein transduction domain (PTD) and a p53 genetic suppressor element (GSE123). The peptide significantly promoted hepatocyte growth factor-induced DNA synthesis and the proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes, which are highly differentiated somatic cells. The addition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence to the peptide increased the internalization of the peptide to the nuclear fraction. Distribution analysis using a fluoresein isothiocyanate-labeled peptide indicated that the NLS enabled the peptide to escape from the lysosomes to the cytosol. As a result, the NLS-Tat-GSE123 peptide induced potent cell proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro. The use of this peptide as an artificial cell growth enhancer, bypassing a specific receptor, is a useful tool for the study of regenerative therapy and cell signaling.",M3
19860923,"Comparative functional analysis of Jembrana disease virus <e>Tat</e> protein on lentivirus long terminal repeat promoters: evidence for flexibility at its N-terminus.BACKGROUND: Jembrana disease virus (JDV) encodes a potent regulatory protein Tat that strongly stimulates viral expression by transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. JDV Tat (jTat) promotes the transcription from its own LTR as well as non-cognate LTRs, by recruiting host transcription factors and facilitating transcriptional elongation. Here, we compared the sequence requirements of jTat for transactivation of JDV, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) LTRs. RESULTS: In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for LTR activation using jTat truncation mutants. We found that jTat N-terminal residues were indispensable for transactivating the HIV LTR. In contrast, transactivation of BIV and JDV LTRs depended largely on an arginine-rich motif and some flanking residues. Competitive inhibition assay and knockdown analysis showed that P-TEFb was required for jTat-mediated LTR transactivation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed the robust interaction of jTat with cyclin T1. In addition, HIV LTR transactivation was largely affected by fusion protein at the jTat N-terminus despite the fact that the cyclin T1-binding affinity was not altered. Furthermore, the jTat N-terminal sequence enabled HIV Tat to transactivate BIV and JDV LTRs, suggesting the flexibility at the jTat N-terminus. CONCLUSION: This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of jTat for HIV, BIV and JDV LTR activation. Residues responsible for interaction with cyclin T1 and transactivation response element are the key determinants for transactivation of its cognate LTR. N-terminal residues in jTat may compensate for transactivation of the HIV LTR, based on the flexibility.",M3
19811073,"Cell-type-specific proteome and interactome: using HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> as a test case.HIV-1 is a small retrovirus that wreaks havoc on the human immune system. It is a puzzle to the scientific community how a virus that encodes only nine proteins can take complete control of its host and redirect the cell to complete replication or maintain latency when necessary. One way to explain the control elicited by HIV-1 is through numerous protein partners that exist between viral and host proteins, allowing HIV-1 to be intimately involved in virtually every aspect of cellular biology. In addition, we postulate that the complexity exerted by HIV-1 can not merely be explained by the large number of protein-protein interactions documented in the literature but, rather, cell-type-specific interactions and post-translational modifications of viral proteins must be taken into account. We use HIV-1 Tat and its influence on viral transcription as an example of cell-type-specific complexity. The influence of post-translational modifications (acetylation and methylation), as well as subcellular localization on Tat binding partners, is also discussed.",M3
19804722,"Arginine-rich peptides destabilize the plasma membrane, consistent with a pore formation translocation mechanism of cell-penetrating peptides.Recent molecular-dynamics simulations have suggested that the arginine-rich HIV <e>Tat</e> peptides translocate by destabilizing and inducing transient pores in phospholipid bilayers. In this pathway for peptide translocation, Arg residues play a fundamental role not only in the binding of the peptide to the surface of the membrane, but also in the destabilization and nucleation of transient pores across the bilayer. Here we present a molecular-dynamics simulation of a peptide composed of nine Args (Arg-9) that shows that this peptide follows the same translocation pathway previously found for the Tat peptide. We test experimentally the hypothesis that transient pores open by measuring ionic currents across phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes through the pores induced by Arg-9 peptides. We find that Arg-9 peptides, in the presence of an electrostatic potential gradient, induce ionic currents across planar phospholipid bilayers, as well as in cultured osteosarcoma cells and human smooth muscle cells. Our results suggest that the mechanism of action of Arg-9 peptides involves the creation of transient pores in lipid bilayers and cell membranes.",M3

The purpose of the present study is to prepare a novel lipid ultrasound microbubble-carrying gene and transactivating transcriptional activator (Tat) peptide and to investigate its transfection effect in vivo. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lipid ultrasound microbubbles were prepared using mechanical vibration, and the appearance, distribution, concentration, diameter, and zeta potential of the lipid ultrasound microbubbles were measured. The efficiencies of the microbubble carrying gene and Tat peptide were investigated using the fluorospectrophotometer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was performed on normal rabbits to observe the duration and intensity of enhancement in myocardium. Quantitative analysis was detected using the DFY Ultrasound Image Analyzer. Transfection in vivo was performed using the CGZZ ultrasound gene transfection instrument. The expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein in the organs was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope. RESULTS: The diameter of the lipid microbubbles carrying gene and Tat was (2.3 +/- 0.4) mum, the concentration was (3.1 +/- 0.4) x10(9)/mL, and Zeta potential was (2.0 +/- 0.1) mV. The gene encapsulation efficiency of the lipid ultrasound microbubbles was 32%, and the Tat encapsulation efficiency was 35%. In vivo experiment showed that lipid ultrasound microbubbles could enhance the echo intensity and transfection efficiency. CONCLUSION: Lipid microbubbles containing gene and Tat peptide can be used as a new vehicle for gene transfection.",M3
19733602,"Specific transgene expression in HIV-infected cells using protease-cleavable transcription regulator.Gene therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of HIV infection, but cell specificity remains an issue. Recently we have developed a new concept for a drug or gene delivery system responding to cellular signals (D-RECS) to achieve cell-specific transgene expression using a non-viral polymer-based vehicle. According to this concept, intracellular signaling enzymes, which are activated specifically in target cells, are used to trigger transgene expression. We previously applied this concept to HIV-1 protease and showed that the recombinant protease could act as a suitable signal. Here we further developed this system to achieve highly specific transgene expression in HIV-infected cells. We prepared a polymeric gene regulator grafted with a cationic peptide containing the HIV-<e>Tat</e> peptide via a specific substrate for HIV-1 protease. The regulator formed a stable polyplex with the transgene, suppressing its transcription. HIV-1 protease cleaved the peptide and released the transgene, which was consequently expressed specifically in activated HIV-infected cells, but remained unreleased and inactive in uninfected cells. The validity of this approach was further confirmed by applying it to the CVB1 2A protease of coxsackievirus (Picornaviridae family). This strategy should be widely applicable for specific expression of a variety of therapeutic genes in virus-infected cells.",M3

19671151,"Mechanism of HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> RNA translation and its activation by the Tat protein.BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein is a major viral transactivator required for HIV-1 replication. In the nucleus Tat greatly stimulates the synthesis of full-length transcripts from the HIV-1 promoter by causing efficient transcriptional elongation. Tat induces elongation by directly interacting with the bulge of the transactivation response (TAR) RNA, a hairpin-loop located at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts, and by recruiting cellular transcriptional co-activators. In the cytoplasm, Tat is thought to act as a translational activator of HIV-1 mRNAs. Thus, Tat plays a central role in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression both at the level of mRNA and protein synthesis. The requirement of Tat in these processes poses an essential question on how sufficient amounts of Tat can be made early on in HIV-1 infected cells to sustain its own synthesis. To address this issue we studied translation of the Tat mRNA in vitro and in human cells using recombinant monocistronic and dicistronic RNAs containing the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of Tat RNA. RESULTS: This study shows that the Tat mRNA can be efficiently translated both in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that translation initiation from the Tat mRNA probably occurs by a internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mechanism. Finally, we show that Tat protein can strongly stimulate translation from its cognate mRNA in a TAR dependent fashion. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Tat mRNA translation is efficient and benefits from a feedback stimulation by the Tat protein. This translational control mechanism would ensure that minute amounts of Tat mRNA are sufficient to generate enough Tat protein required to stimulate HIV-1 replication.",M3
19659778,"Protective anti-tumour immune responses by murine dendritic cells pulsed with recombinant <e>Tat</e>-carcinoembryonic antigen derived from Escherichia coli.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is over-expressed on various human cancer cells and has been the target of immunotherapies using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with CEA-specific RNA or peptides, or transduced by CEA-expressing adenovirus or vaccinia virus. Because activated DCs do not phagocytose soluble protein antigens efficiently and pure immature DCs are not obtained easily ex vivo, an efficacious whole CEA protein-loaded DC vaccine has not been reported. To improve the antigen delivery into DCs, we utilized CEA conjugated to a protein-transduction domain, human immunodeficiency virus transactivating Tat. Furthermore, we purified the truncated non-glycosylated CEA from Escherichia coli to overcome the safety concerns and immunosuppressive functions associated with the native CEA protein. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence activating cell sorter analysis, we demonstrated that the Tat-CEA protein entered the cytoplasm of DCs efficiently within 10 min of co-culture, compared with the negligible amount of CEA into DCs 30 min later. CEA-specific T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T cell responses were enhanced significantly in mice immunized with Tat-CEA-pulsed DCs [DC (Tat-CEA)] compared with those immunized with CEA-pulsed DCs [DC (CEA)]. T helper type 1 responses were more prominent in the DC (Tat-CEA) immunized mice whose splenocytes secreted more interferon-gamma and less interleukin-4 than those from DC (CEA) immunized mice. In vivo, the DC (Tat-CEA) vaccine delayed tumour growth significantly and prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results suggest that protective epitopes are well preserved on bacteria-derived recombinant Tat-CEA. This strategy may provide a basic platform for DC-based anti-CEA vaccines that could be utilized in combination with advanced immune-enhancing therapeutics.",M3
19657743,"<e>Tat</e> peptide is capable of importing large nanoparticles across nuclear membrane in digitonin permeabilized cells.Understanding the capabilities and limitations of nuclear import is crucial to efficient delivery of macromolecules and nanoparticles for diagnosis and targeted therapy of diseases. Here we report the Tat peptide-mediated import of different cargos into cell nucleus, including dye-labeled streptavidin protein, 43 and 90 nm fluorescent beads, as well as approximately 20 nm quantum dots for kinetic measurements. Our results revealed significant differences between Tat- and NLS-mediated nuclear import: unlike delivery with the NLS, Tat peptide-based delivery is not inhibited by WGA blockage nor does it require ATP. Surprisingly, Tat peptide was able to import 90 nm beads into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells, suggesting that its interaction with the nuclear envelope follows a mechanism different from that of NLS. The import kinetics was quantified using Tat peptide-conjugated QDs, yielding a kinetic constant of 0.0085 s(-1). Taken together, our results suggest that, compared with NLS, Tat peptide-mediated nuclear import is faster, follows a different pathway, and is capable of importing large nanoparticles. These results have significant implications for the development of new approaches for delivery of cargo into the nuclei of living cells.",M3
19625648,"Human neutrophils coordinate chemotaxis by differential activation of Rac1 and Rac2.Rac1 and Rac2, members of the small Rho GTPase family, play essential roles in coordinating directional migration and superoxide production during neutrophil responses to chemoattractants. Although earlier studies in Rac1 and Rac2 knockout mice have demonstrated unique roles for each Rac isoform in chemotaxis and NADPH oxidase activation, it is still unclear how human neutrophils use Rac1 and Rac2 to achieve their immunological responses to foreign agent stimulation. In the current study, we used <e>TAT</e> dominant-negative Rac1-T17N and Rac2-T17N fusion proteins to acutely alter the activity of Rac1 and Rac2 individually in human neutrophils. We demonstrate distinct activation kinetics and different roles for Rac1 and Rac2 in response to low vs high concentrations of fMLP. These observations were verified using neutrophils from mice in which Rac1 or Rac2 was genetically absent. Based on these results, we propose a model to explain how human neutrophils kill invading microbes while limiting oxidative damage to the adjacent surrounding healthy tissue through the differential activation of Rac1 and Rac2 in response to different concentrations of chemoattractant.",M3

Consistent with previous studies, direct interactions of rat hippocampal cells with Tat 1-86 B were shown to cause dose-dependent and time-dependent neurotoxicity associated with activation of caspases from the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Despite the similar binding/uptake properties, Cys22 Tat 1-86 B failed to induce significant neurotoxicity and activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 in hippocampal primary cultures. Results of the study underscore the important role of cysteine-rich domain in mechanism of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity.",M3
19580742,"Alternative mechanisms for the interaction of the cell-penetrating peptides penetratin and the <e>TAT</e> peptide with lipid bilayers.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have recently attracted much interest due to their apparent ability to penetrate cell membranes in an energy-independent manner. Here molecular-dynamics simulation techniques were used to study the interaction of two CPPs: penetratin and the TAT peptide with 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) phospolipid bilayers shed light on alternative mechanisms by which these peptides might cross biological membranes. In contrast to previous simulation studies of charged peptides interacting with lipid bilayers, no spontaneous formation of transmembrane pores was observed. Instead, the simulations suggest that the peptides may enter the cell by micropinocytosis, whereby the peptides induce curvature in the membrane, ultimately leading to the formation of small vesicles within the cell that encapsulate the peptides. Specifically, multiple peptides were observed to induce large deformations in the lipid bilayer that persisted throughout the timescale of the simulations (hundreds of nanoseconds). Pore formation could be induced in simulations in which an external potential was used to pull a single penetratin or TAT peptide into the membrane. With the use of umbrella-sampling techniques, the free energy of inserting a single penetratin peptide into a DPPC bilayer was estimated to be approximately 75 kJmol(-1), which suggests that the spontaneous penetration of single peptides would require a timescale of at least seconds to minutes. This work also illustrates the extent to which the results of such simulations can depend on the initial conditions, the extent of equilibration, the size of the system, and the conditions under which the simulations are performed. The implications of this with respect to the current systems and to simulations of membrane-peptide interactions in general are discussed.",M3
19573019,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor infused intracerebroventricularly shows reduced catabolic effects when linked to the <e>TAT</e> protein transduction domain.Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) regulates the differentiation and survival of a wide spectrum of developing and adult neurons, including motor neuron loss after injury. We recently described a cell-penetrant recombinant human CNTF (rhCNTF) molecule, formed by fusion with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain (TAT-CNTF) that, upon subcutaneous administration, retains full neurotrophic activity without cytokine-like side-effects. Although the CNTF receptor is present in hypothalamic nuclei, which are involved in the control of energy, rhCNTF but not TAT-CNTF stimulates signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus after subcutaneous administration. This could be due limited TAT-CNTF distribution in the hypothalamus and/or altered intracellular signaling by the fusion protein. To explore these possibilities, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of TAT-CNTF in male adult rats. TAT-CNTF-induced weight loss, although the effect was smaller than that seen with either rhCNTF or leptin (which exerts CNTF-like effects via its receptor). In contrast to rhCNTF and leptin, TAT-CNTF neither induced morphological changes in adipose tissues nor increased uncoupling protein 1 expression in brown adipose tissue, a characteristic feature of rhCNTF and leptin. Acute intracerebroventricular administration of TAT-CNTF induced a less robust phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 in the hypothalamus, compared with rhCNTF. The data show that fusion of a protein transduction domain may change rhCNTF CNS distribution, while further strengthening the utility of cell-penetrating peptide technology to neurotrophic factor biology beyond the neuroscience field.",M3
19526283,"Role of <e>Tat</e> protein in HIV neuropathogenesis.The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the neurocognitive deficits associated with HIV infection. This is the earliest protein to be produced by the proviral DNA in the infected cell. The protein not only drives the regulatory regions of the virus but may also be actively released from the cell and then interact with the cell surface receptors of other uninfected cells in the brain leading to cellular dysfunction. It may also be taken up by these cells and can then activate a number of host genes. The Tat protein is highly potent and has the unique ability to travel along neuronal pathways. Importantly, its production is not impacted by the use of antiretroviral drugs once the proviral DNA has been formed. This article reviews the pleomorphic actions of Tat protein and the evidence supporting its central role in the neuropathogenesis of the HIV infection.",M3
19513678,"Targeting repair proteins to the mitochondria of mammalian cells through stable transfection, transient transfection, viral transduction, and <e>TAT</e>-mediated protein transduction.The mitochondrial genome represents a target for exogenous and endogenous damage. Its necessity for successful electron transport makes its repair valuable to the cell. Previous work from our lab has shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be repaired in mammalian cells, and the use of mitochondrial-targeted repair proteins can augment repair to enhance viability following genotoxic stress. In addition, it has also been shown that other repair enzymes that are targeted to the mitochondria can sensitize the cell to DNA damaging agents, thereby aiding the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents. The methods herein describe the development of mitochondrial-targeted proteins using plasmids or protein transduction domains. It includes the utilization of these constructs to create stably transfected cell lines, transiently transfected cell lines, viral-mediated transduction, and protein transduction domain-mediated mitochondrial protein localization. The end result will be a mammalian cell that expresses the mitochondrial-targeted protein of interest.",M3
19495967,"Detecting protein-protein interactions in living cells: development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay to evaluate the PSD-95/NMDA receptor interaction.The PDZ domain mediated interaction between the NMDA receptor and its intracellular scaffolding protein, PSD-95, is a potential target for treatment of ischemic brain diseases. We have recently developed a number of peptide analogues with improved affinity for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 compared to the endogenous C-terminal peptide of the NMDA receptor, as evaluated by a cell-free protein-protein interaction assay. However, it is important to address both membrane permeability and effect in living cells. Therefore a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay was established, where the C-terminal of the NMDA receptor and PDZ2 of PSD-95 were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and expressed in COS7 cells. A robust and specific BRET signal was obtained by expression of the appropriate partner proteins and subsequently, the assay was used to evaluate a <e>Tat</e>-conjugated peptide for its ability to disrupt the PSD-95/NMDA receptor interaction in living cells.",M3
19478831,"Functional substitution by <e>TAT</e>-utrophin in dystrophin-deficient mice.BACKGROUND: The loss of dystrophin compromises muscle cell membrane stability and causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy and/or various forms of cardiomyopathy. Increased expression of the dystrophin homolog utrophin by gene delivery or pharmacologic up-regulation has been demonstrated to restore membrane integrity and improve the phenotype in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. However, the lack of a viable therapy in humans predicates the need to explore alternative methods to combat dystrophin deficiency. We investigated whether systemic administration of recombinant full-length utrophin (Utr) or DeltaR4-21  micro  utrophin (muUtr) protein modified with the cell-penetrating TAT protein transduction domain could attenuate the phenotype of mdx mice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant TAT-Utr and TAT-muUtr proteins were expressed using the baculovirus system and purified using FLAG-affinity chromatography. Age-matched mdx mice received six twice-weekly intraperitoneal injections of either recombinant protein or PBS. Three days after the final injection, mice were analyzed for several phenotypic parameters of dystrophin deficiency. Injected TAT-muUtr transduced all tissues examined, integrated with members of the dystrophin complex, reduced serum levels of creatine kinase (11,290+/-920 U versus 5,950+/-1,120 U; PBS versus TAT), the prevalence of muscle degeneration/regeneration (54%+/-5% versus 37%+/-4% of centrally nucleated fibers; PBS versus TAT), the susceptibility to eccentric contraction-induced force drop (72%+/-5% versus 40%+/-8% drop; PBS versus TAT), and increased specific force production (9.7+/-1.1 N/cm(2) versus 12.8+/-0.9 N/cm(2); PBS versus TAT). CONCLUSIONS: These results are, to our knowledge, the first to establish the efficacy and feasibility of TAT-utrophin-based constructs as a novel direct protein-replacement therapy for the treatment of skeletal and cardiac muscle diseases caused by loss of dystrophin.",M3
19470243,"Inhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide production by transduced <e>Tat</e>-arginine deiminase fusion protein in Raw 264.7 cells.Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activities and is capable of inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO). Modulation of nitric oxide (NO) production is considered a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, inflammation and neuronal disorders. In this study, an ADI gene was fused with an HIV-1 Tat peptide in a bacterial expression vector to produce an genetic in-frame Tat-ADI fusion protein. When added exogenously to the culture media, the expressed and purified Tat-ADI fusion proteins were efficiently transduced into macrophage Raw 264.7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, transduced Tat-ADI fusion proteins markedly increased cell viability in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This increase in viability was mediated by an inhibition of NO production. These results suggest that this Tat-ADI fusion protein can be used in protein therapies of NO-related disorders such as cancer, inflammation and neuronal diseases.",M3
19466601,"The heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) operates predominantly by blocking the mitochondrial-independent/extrinsic pathway of cellular apoptosis.Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is a molecular chaperone protein which regulates cell apoptosis by interacting directly with the caspase activation components in the apoptotic pathways. With the assistance of the <e>Tat</e> protein transduction domain we directly delivered the Hsp27 into the myocardial cell line, H9c2 and demonstrate that this protein can reverse hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cells. In order to characterize the contribution of Hsp27 in blocking the two major apoptotic pathways operational within cells, we exposed H9c2 cells to staurosporine and cobalt chloride, agents that induce mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) and -independent (extrinsic) pathways of apoptosis in cells respectively. The Tat-Hsp27 fusion protein showed a greater propensity to inhibit the effect induced by the cobalt chloride treatment. These data suggest that the Hsp27 predominantly exerts its protective effect by interfering with the components of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.",M3
19429666,"Endothelin-I and angiotensin II inhibit arterial voltage-gated K+ channels through different protein kinase C isoenzymes.AIMS: Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels of arterial smooth muscle (ASM) modulate arterial tone and are inhibited by vasoconstrictors through protein kinase C (PKC). We aimed to determine whether endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (AngII), which cause similar inhibition of Kv, use the same signalling pathway and PKC isoenzyme to exert their effects on Kv and to compare the involvement of PKC isoenzymes in contractile responses to these agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Kv currents recorded using the patch clamp technique with freshly isolated rat mesenteric ASM cells were inhibited by ET-1 or AngII. Inclusion of a PKCepsilon inhibitor peptide in the intracellular solution substantially reduced inhibition by AngII, but did not affect that by ET-1. Kv inhibition by ET-1 was reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor Gö 6976 but not by the PKCbeta inhibitor LY333531. Selective peptide inhibitors of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon were linked to a <e>Tat</e> carrier peptide to make them membrane permeable and used to show that inhibition of PKCalpha prevented ET-1 inhibition of Kv current, but did not affect that by AngII. In contrast, inhibition of PKCepsilon prevented Kv inhibition by AngII but not by ET-1. The Tat-linked inhibitor peptides were also used to investigate the involvement of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon in the contractile responses of mesenteric arterial rings, showing that ET-1 contractions were substantially reduced by inhibition of PKCalpha, but unaffected by inhibition of PKCepsilon. AngII contractions were unaffected by inhibition of PKCalpha but substantially reduced by inhibition of PKCepsilon. CONCLUSION: ET-1 inhibits Kv channels of mesenteric ASM through activation of PKCalpha, while AngII does so through PKCepsilon. This implies that ET-1 and AngII target Kv channels of ASM through different pathways of PKC-interacting proteins, so each vasoconstrictor enables its distinct PKC isoenzyme to interact functionally with the Kv channel.",M3
19413454,"<e>TAT</e>-based drug delivery system--new directions in protein delivery for new hopes?There has been great progress in the use of TAT-based drug delivery systems for the delivery of different macromolecules into cells in vitro and in vivo, thus circumventing the bioavailability barrier that is a problem for so many drugs. There are many advantages to using this system, such as the ability to deliver these cargoes into all types of cells in culture and into all organs in vivo. This system can even deliver cargoes into the brain across the blood-brain barrier. In addition, the ability to target specific intracellular sub-localizations such as the nuclei, the mitochondria and lysosomes further expands the possibilities of this drug delivery system to the development of sub-cellular organelle-targeted therapy. The therapeutic applications seem almost unlimited, and the use of the TAT-based delivery system has extended from proteins to a large variety of cargoes such as oligonucleotides, imaging agents, low molecular mass drugs, nanoparticles, micelles and liposomes. In this review the most recent advances in the use of the TAT-based drug delivery system will be described, mainly discussing TAT-mediated protein delivery and the use of the TAT system for enzyme replacement therapy.",M3
19400584,"Cell-penetrating HIV1 <e>TAT</e> peptides float on model lipid bilayers.Cell-penetrating peptides like the cationic HIV1 TAT peptide are able to translocate across cell membranes and to carry molecular cargoes into the cellular interior. For most of these peptides, the biophysical mechanism of the membrane translocation is still quite unknown. We analyzed HIV1 TAT peptide binding and mobility within biological model membranes. To this end, we generated neutral and anionic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol and containing DPPC, DOPC, cholesterol, and DPPS (DOPS), respectively. First, we characterized the mobility of fluorescently labeled lipids (TR-DHPE) within liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered lipid phases by single-molecule tracking, yielding a D(LO) of 0.6 +/- 0.05 microm(2)/s and a D(LD) of 2.5 +/- 0.05 microm(2)/s, respectively, as a reference. Fluorescently labeled TAT peptides accumulated on neutral GUVs but bound very efficiently to anionic GUVs. Single-molecule tracking revealed that HIV1 TAT peptides move on neutral and anionic GUV surfaces with a D(N,TAT) of 5.3 +/- 0.2 microm(2)/s and a D(A,TAT) of 3.3 +/- 0.2 mum(2)/s, respectively. TAT peptide diffusion was faster than fluorescent lipid diffusion, and also independent of the phase state of the membrane. We concluded that TAT peptides are not incorporated into but rather floating on lipid bilayers, but they immerged deeper into the headgroup domain of anionic lipids. The diffusion constants were not dependent on the TAT concentration ranging from 150 pM to 2 microM, indicating that the peptides were not aggregated on the membrane and not forming any  carpet .",M3
19394064,"Differential patterns of immune escape at <e>Tat</e>-specific cytotoxic T cell epitopes in pigtail macaques.Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to conserved proteins such as Gag within HIV- or SIV-infected hosts can facilitate partial control of viremia. However, the utility of targeting variable viral proteins by CTL responses is unclear. We studied CTL responses to regulatory and accessory proteins of SIV in pigtail macaques. The regulatory and accessory proteins were the most commonly targeted proteins by CTL responses from pigtail macaques. We identified 2 novel Tat-specific CTL responses that were both restricted by the Mane-A10 allele. Viral escape at one of the Tat epitopes, KSA10, was slower in comparison to another Tat epitope KVA10. The kinetics of escape of the KSA10 Tat epitope were more similar to an immunodominant KP9 Gag epitope also restricted by Mane-A10. Our results suggest that some regulatory or accessory CTL epitopes may be useful targets for vaccination against HIV.",M3
19384335,"<e>TAT</e>-Hsp70-mediated neuroprotection and increased survival of neuronal precursor cells after focal cerebral ischemia in mice.Cerebral ischemia stimulates endogenous neurogenesis within the subventricular zone and the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the adult rodent brain. However, such newly generated cells soon die after cerebral ischemia. To enhance postischemic survival of neural precursor cells (NPC) and long-lasting neural regeneration, we applied the antiapoptotic chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) fused to a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the HIV TAT to ensure delivery across the blood-brain barrier and the cell membrane. After transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice, TAT-Hsp70 was intravenously injected concomitant with reperfusion and additionally on day 14 after stroke. TAT-Hsp70 treatment resulted in smaller infarct size (27.1+/-9.0 versus 109.0+/-14.0 and 88.5+/-26.0 mm(3) in controls) and in functional improvement as assessed by the rota rod, tight rope, and water maze tests when compared with saline- and TAT-hemagglutinin-treated controls. In addition, postischemic survival of endogenous doublecortin (Dcx)-positive NPC was improved within the lesioned striatum of TAT-Hsp70-treated animals for up to 4 weeks after stroke without changing overall cell proliferation of BrdU(+) cells. Thus, TAT-Hsp70 treatment after stroke may be a promising tool to act neuroprotective and improve postischemic functional outcome, and also to increase survival of endogenous NPC after stroke.",M3
19352325,"BH3-based fusion artificial peptide induces apoptosis and targets human colon cancer.Dysregulation of apoptosis is a pilot event before cancer development and plays important roles for cancer to develop resistance to chemical therapeutics. So exploring strategies to recovery the apoptosis balance is a charming and long-endeavored aim in the attempts to conquer cancers. The present study shows an exciting potency of a fusion peptide to inhibit and target to cancer cells, which is composed of BH3 (Bcl-2 Homology 3) effector domain from PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and targeting domain of trans-activator of transcription (<e>TAT</e>) and DV3. The in vitro results demonstrated cancer growth inhibition by the fusion peptide in colon cancer cells, as well as in lung adenocarcinoma cell line and breast carcinoma cell line of human origin. But the viability of HEK293, a noncancerous cell line, was not affected, indicating the cancer specificity of the fusion peptide. Apoptosis activation was induced by the peptide through the mitochondria pathway. In vivo studies displayed its tumor inhibiting ability by intratumoral injection. When the fusion peptide was administered systematically by tail vein, the peptide targeted the established tumors in nude mice. No other organs were significantly involved. The fusion peptide is an artificially designed molecule worthy of further evaluation and development.",M3
19334077,"Excitotoxicity-induced endocytosis confers drug targeting in cerebral ischemia.OBJECTIVE: Targeting neuroprotectants specifically to the cells that need them is a major goal in biomedical research. Many peptidic protectants contain an active sequence linked to a carrier such as the transactivator of transcription (<e>TAT</e>) transduction sequence, and here we test the hypothesis that TAT-linked peptides are selectively endocytosed into neurons stressed by excitotoxicity and focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: In vivo experiments involved intracerebroventricular injection of TAT peptides or conventional tracers (peroxidase, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) in young rats exposed to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at postnatal day 12. Cellular mechanisms of uptake were analyzed in dissociated cortical neuronal cultures. RESULTS: In both models, all tracers were taken up selectively into stressed neurons by endocytosis. In the in vivo model, this was neuron specific and limited to the ischemic area, where the neurons displayed enhanced immunolabeling for early endosomal antigen-1 and clathrin. The highly efficient uptake of TAT peptides occurred by the same selective mechanism as for conventional tracers. All tracers were targeted to the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons that appeared viable, although ultimately destined to die. In dissociated cortical neuronal cultures, an excitotoxic dose of N-methyl-D-aspartate induced a similar endocytosis. It was 100 times more efficient with TAT peptides than with dextran, because the former bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface, but it depended on dynamin and clathrin in both cases. INTERPRETATION: Excitotoxicity-induced endocytosis is the main entry route for protective TAT peptides and targets selectively the neurons that need to be protected.",M3
19327051,"Differential regulation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by HIV type 1 clade B and C <e>Tat</e> protein.Previous studies have demonstrated that infection with HIV-1 clades might differentially contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). HIV-1 transactivator regulatory protein (Tat) plays a major role in the process of disruption of neuronal function. It is not well understood how these HIV-1 subtypes exert different neuropathogenic effects. Activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway, leads to increased tryptophan catabolism and the generation of neurotoxins such as kynurenine (KYN). It is known that KYN plays a crucial role in the neuropathogenesis of HAD. We hypothesize that HIV-1 clade B and C Tat proteins might exert differential effects on human primary astrocytes by the upregulation of the IDO gene and protein expression as well as its activity and production of the neurotoxin KYN. RNA extracted from human primary astrocytes treated with either HIV-1 clade B and C Tat proteins was reverse transcribed and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine IDO gene expression. In addition, the enzymatic activity of IDO and the concentration of KYN were measured in cell lysates and culture supernatants. Our results indicate that HIV-1 clade B Tat protein significantly upregulated the IDO gene and protein expression, IDO enzyme activity, as well as KYN concentration compared to HIV-1 clade C Tat protein. Thus, our studies for the first time demonstrate that HIV-1 clade B Tat protein in human primary astrocytes appears to increase the level of neuropathogenic agents, such as IDO and KYN, as compared to HIV-1 clade C Tat protein. These results provide further evidence that the prevalence of HAD may be correlated with the difference in clades of HIV-1.",M3
19278221,"Endocytosis and membrane potential are required for HeLa cell uptake of R.I.-CKTat9, a retro-inverso <e>Tat</e> cell penetrating peptide.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can enter many types of cells and have become useful tools for introducing a variety of cargo such as exogenous peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids into cultured cells in vitro. Tat CPPs derived from the HIV-1 Tat protein are the most widely used among the arginine-rich CPPs. Even though CPPs hold considerable promise for drug delivery, poor biological stability and high in vivo clearance may limit their effectiveness for delivering cargo. Therefore, we utilize a retro-inverso form of a Tat peptide, R.I.-CKTat9, which is proteolytically stable. In the current study, the cellular entry mechanism of this arginine-rich CPP is investigated. Fluorescently labeled R.I.-CKTat9 entered HeLa cells in a concentration- and energy-dependent manner demonstrating both diffuse and punctate (vesicular) appearance inside the cells. The labeled R.I.-CKTat9 colocalized with labeled transferrin in the punctate structure, suggesting that the peptide enters HeLa cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Incubation of cells with an isotonic/high K(+) buffer (KPBS) or an NH(4)Cl solution abolished the diffuse but not the punctate fluorescence, suggesting that membrane potential plays a critical role. This result also suggests that the flux originates from the endosome, not the extracellular space, and relies on the acidity of the endosome. Impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by RNAi with clathrin heavy chain function and endocytosis inhibitors greatly reduced or completely abolished both diffuse and punctate fluorescence, further supporting a single route of endocytosis and subsequent endosomal escape. Since cells in the mitotic (M) phase shut down endocytosis but maintain plasma membrane potential, this property was used to further confirm the endocytic mechanism. Direct measurement of plasma membrane potential confirmed its persistence in M phase arrested HeLa cells. Consistent with our working hypothesis, these cells did not show any vesicular nor diffuse fluorescence of labeled R.I.-CKTat9, providing compelling evidence for the sequential steps of endocytosis and endosomal escape. Binding of labeled R.I.-CKTat9 to the surface of HeLa cells at 0 degrees C was reduced under the mildly acidic conditions of early endosomes, suggesting an acidity-dependent endosomal escape mechanism. Overall, these results indicate that both endocytosis and membrane potential are required for R.I.-CKTat9 entry into HeLa cells and suggest that translocation occurs at the endosomal membrane.",M3
19268337,"Latently-infected CD4+ T cells are enriched for HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> variants with impaired transactivation activity.The ability of HIV to establish latent infection in CD4+ lymphocytes represents a major barrier to the eradication of HIV. It is not clear what mechanisms favor latent over productive infection, but prior studies have suggested a role for the viral transcription factor Tat or its RNA target, TAR. Using samples from five individuals who were started on ART within 6 months of infection and achieved a viral load &lt;50 (suppressed), we isolated one- and two-exon tat RNA from HIV propagated ex vivo from baseline plasma and from co-cultures of CD4+ T cells obtained at baseline and suppressed time points. Compared to virus from the baseline plasma (mostly from productively-infected CD4+ T cells), virus from the baseline and suppressed co-cultures (mostly from latently-infected cells) had more Tat variants with impaired transactivation activity. These findings suggest that impaired activity in the Tat-TAR axis may contribute to the establishment of latent infection in CD4+ T cells.",M3
19245529,"Genetic and biochemical properties of an alkaline phosphatase PhoX family protein found in many bacteria.We report on the biochemical, phylogenetic and genetic regulation of PhoX, the major alkaline phosphatase protein from the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The protein is shown to be a member of a recently identified family of PhoX alkaline phosphatase proteins that is distinct from the well-characterized PhoA family. The mature S. meliloti PhoX protein is located in the periplasm and lacks a 76-amino-acid N-terminal <e>Tat</e> signal peptide. Its phosphatase activity was stimulated by Ca(+2) and was optimal at pH 9-11. Except for phytic acid and phosphatidic acid, the enzyme was active against a wide range of phosphorylated substrates (77 nucleotides, phosphorylated carbohydrates and amino acids) and thus exhibited low substrate specificity for C-O-P bonds. No C-P bond substrate was dephosphorylated while the protein was active with two of six phosphoramidate substrates (N-P bond) tested. Sinorhizobium meliloti phoX was induced when cells were starved for phosphorous and the induction was dependent on the PhoB-regulatory protein. We demonstrate by in vitro analysis that PhoB protein binds to two tandem 22 nt PhoB binding sites located 64-21 nt upstream from the phoX transcription start site. Analysis of 95 PhoX orthologues from diverse bacteria revealed two distinct phylogenetic groups of PhoX proteins. The two groups differed in having a conserved glycine (PhoX-I) or asparagine (PhoX-II) next to their putative catalytic Ca(+2) binding site. Analysis of the phoX promoter regions from many of these bacteria also revealed the presence of PhoB binding sites. Alkaline phosphatase proteins of either the PhoX or PhoA family (but rarely both) are found in many bacteria, thus it appears that these are functionally equivalent.",M3
19223581,"<e>Tat</e> acetylation modulates assembly of a viral-host RNA-protein transcription complex.HIV-1 Tat enhances viral transcription elongation by forming a ribonucleoprotein complex with transactivating responsive (TAR) RNA and P-TEFb, an elongation factor composed of cyclin T1 (CycT1) and Cdk9 that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Previous studies have shown that Lys-28 in the activation domain (AD) of Tat is essential for HIV-1 transcription and replication and is acetylated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), but the mechanistic basis of the Lys-28 requirement is unknown. Here, we show that Lys-28 acetylation modulates the affinity and stability of HIV-1 Tat-CycT1-TAR complexes by enhancing an interaction with the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif. High-affinity assembly correlates strongly with stimulation of transcription elongation in vitro and Tat activation in vivo. In marked contrast, bovine lentiviral Tat proteins have evolved a high-affinity TAR interaction that does not require PCAF-mediated acetylation of the Tat AD or CycT1 for RNA binding, whereas HIV-2 Tat has evolved an intermediate mechanism that uses a duplicated TAR element and CycT1 to enhance RNA affinity and consequently transcription activation. The coevolution of Tat acetylation, CycT1 dependence, and TAR binding affinity is seen in viral replication assays using Tat proteins that rely on CycT1 for TAR binding but are acetylation deficient, where compensatory mutations rapidly accrue in TAR to generate high-affinity, CycT1-independent complexes reminiscent of the bovine viruses. Thus, lysine acetylation can be used to modulate and evolve the strength of a viral-host RNA-protein complex, thereby tuning the levels of transcription elongation.",M3
19206074,"Effects of dimerization of the cell-penetrating peptide <e>Tat</e> analog on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action.The cell-penetrating peptide Tat (48-60) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) derived from HIV-1 Tat protein showed potent antibacterial activity (MIC: 2-8 microM). To investigate the effect of dimerization of Tat (48-60) analog, [Tat(W): GRKKRRQRRRPWQ-NH(2)], on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action, its dimeric peptides, di-Tat(W)-C and di-Tat(W)-K, were synthesized by a disulfide bond linkage and lysine linkage of monomeric Tat(W), respectively. From the viewpoint of a weight basis and the monomer concentration, these dimeric peptides displayed almost similar antimicrobial activity against six bacterial strains tested but acted more rapidly against Staphylococcus aureus on kinetics of bactericidal activity, compared with monomeric Tat(W). Unlike monomeric Tat(W), these dimeric peptides significantly depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of intact S. aureus cells at MIC and induced dye leakage from bacterial-membrane-mimicking egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (7:3, w/w) vesicles. Furthermore, these dimeric peptides were less effective to translocate across lipid bilayers than monomeric Tat(W). These results indicated that the dimerization of Tat analog induces a partial change in the mode of its bactericidal action from intracellular target mechanism to membrane-targeting mechanism. Collectively, our designed dimeric Tat peptides with high antimicrobial activity and rapid bactericidal activity appear to be excellent candidates for future development as novel antimicrobial agents.",M3
19195057,"Cell-permeable <e>Tat</e>-NBD peptide attenuates rat pancreatitis and acinus cell inflammation response.AIM: To investigate the effects of Tat-NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide on taurocholate-induced pancreatitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated AR42J acinus cells inflammatory response in rats. METHODS: Sodium taurocholate (5%) was used to induce the pancreatitis model. Forty-eight rats from the taurocholate group received an intravenous bolus of 13 mg/kg Tat-NBD (wild-type, WT) peptide, Tat-NBD (mutant-type, MT) peptide, NBD peptide or Tat peptide. The pancreatic histopathology was analyzed by hematoxylin staining. LPS was added to the culture medium to stimulate the AR42J cells. For pretreatment, cells were incubated with different peptides for 2 h before LPS stimulation. Expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA was analyzed using a semi-quantitative reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha protein in culture medium were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-kappaB DNA-binding in pancreas was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. P65 expression of AR42J was determined by Strept Actividin-Biotin Complex (SABC) method. RESULTS: Pretreatment with Tat-NBD (WT) peptide at a concentration of 13 mg/kg body wt showed beneficial effect in pancreaitis model. LPS (10 mg/L) resulted in an increase of IL-1beta mRNA, IL-1beta protein, TNF-alpha mRNA and TNF-alpha protein, whereas significantly inhibitory effects were observed when cells were incubated with Tat-NBD (WT). Consisting with p65 expression decrease analyzed by SABC method, NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity significantly decreased in Tat-NBD (WT) pretreatment group, especially at the largest dose. No significant changes were found in the control peptide group. CONCLUSION: Our result supports that active NF-kappaB participates in the pathogenesis of STC-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Tat-NBD (WT) peptide has anti-inflammatory effects in this model and inhibits the inflammation of acinus simulated by LPS.",M3
19182532,"Multiple roles for Puralpha in cellular and viral regulation.Pur-alpha is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein that is strongly conserved throughout evolution, binds to both DNA and RNA and functions in the initiation of DNA replication, control of transcription and mRNA translation. In addition, it binds to several cellular regulatory proteins including the retinoblastoma protein, E2F-1, Sp1, YB-1, cyclin T1/Cdk9 and cyclin A/Cdk2. These observations and functional studies provide evidence that Puralpha is a major player in the regulation of the cell cycle and oncogenic transformation. Puralpha also binds to viral proteins such as the large T-antigen of JC virus (JCV) and the <e>Tat</e> protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and plays a role in the cross-communication of these viruses in the opportunistic polyomavirus JC (JCV) brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The creation of transgenic mice with inactivation of the PURA gene that encodes Puralpha has revealed that Puralpha is critical for postnatal brain development and has unraveled an essential role of Puralpha in the transport of specific mRNAs to the dendrites and the establishment of the postsynaptic compartment in the developing neurons. Finally, the availability of cell cultures from the PURA knockout mice has allowed studies that have unraveled a role for Puralpha in DNA repair.",M3
19167500,"<e>TAT</e>-Bcl-x(L) improves survival of neuronal precursor cells in the lesioned striatum after focal cerebral ischemia.Cerebral ischemia activates endogenous neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus. Consecutively, SVZ-derived neural precursors migrate towards ischemic lesions. However, functional relevance of activated neurogenesis is limited by poor survival of new-born precursors. We therefore employed the HI-virus-derived fusion protein TAT-Bcl-x(L) to study the effects of acute anti-apoptotic treatment on endogenous neurogenesis and functional outcome after transient cerebral ischemia in mice. TAT-Bcl-x(L) treatment led to significantly reduced acute ischemic cell death (128+/-23 vs. 305+/-65 TUNEL+ cells/mm(2) in controls) and infarct volumes resulting in less motor deficits and improved spatial learning. It significantly increased survival of doublecortin (Dcx)-positive neuronal precursors (389+/-96 vs. 213+/-97 Dcx+ cells in controls) but did not enhance overall post-ischemic cell proliferation or lesion-specific neuronal differentiation 28 days after ischemia. Our data demonstrate that post-stroke TAT-Bcl-x(L)-treatment results in acute neuroprotection, improved functional outcome, and enhanced survival of lesion-specific neuronal precursor cells after cerebral ischemia in mice.",M3
19124416,"Local <e>TAT</e>-p27Kip1 fusion protein inhibits cell proliferation in rat carotid arteries.INTRODUCTION: p27(Kip1) is a cyclin kinase inhibitor that induces cell cycle arrest. In this study, the efficacy of fusion protein TAT- p27(Kip1) to inhibit cell proliferation in rat perivascular injured carotid arteries was tested. METHODS: The cDNA of p27(Kip1) and GFP (green fluorescein protein) fused to the TAT epitope, which allows cell penetration, yielded TAT-p27 (Kip1) and TAT-GFP fusion proteins. In vitro biological activity on cell proliferation was evaluated by [(3)H] thymidine DNA incorporation in rabbit aortic endothelial cells (REC). An in vivo model used a silicone collar filled with saline positioned around the carotid vessel for 14 days to produce an increased adventitia cross-sectional area. RESULTS: TAT-p27(Kip1) inhibited REC proliferation in vitro using either 100, 200, and 500 nM compared to control (88.2 +/- 4.4, 81.3 +/- 7, 71.9 +/- 4.2 vs. 100 +/- 6.7%, N = 3, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). This response was stable for purified proteins stored at -20*C for at least 23 days. In vivo , TAT-p27(Kip1) solution reduced adventitia cross-sectional area in a dose-dependent manner compared to TAT-GFP (area in mm(2) - TAT-p27(Kip1): 200 nM, 0.160 +/- 0.018; 500 nM, 0.050 +/- 0.005 vs. TAT-GFP: 500 nM, 0.595 +/- 0.066 vs. the contralateral: 0.047 +/- 0.005, N = 7, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results provide evidence that TAT-p27(Kip1) can inhibit vascular cells proliferation. It is the first successful demonstration that the cell permeable TAT-p27(Kip1) has potential as a vascular anti-proliferative agent.",M3
19100310,"Secretion and uptake of <e>TAT</e>-fusion proteins produced by engineered mammalian cells.BACKGROUND: Intracellular signaling can be regulated by the exogenous addition of physiological protein inhibitors coupled to the TAT protein transduction domain. Thus far experiments have been performed with purified inhibitors added exogenously to cells in vitro or administered in vivo. Production of secretable TAT-fusion proteins by engineered mammalian cells, their uptake, and route of entry has not been thoroughly investigated. Such methodology, if established, could be useful for transplantation purposes. METHODS: Secretion of TAT-fusion proteins from transfected mammalian cells was achieved by means of a signal peptide. Cell uptake and subcellular localization of TAT-fusion proteins were determined by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Engineered TAT-fusion proteins were secreted with variable efficiency depending on the nature of the protein fused to the TAT peptide. Secreted proteins were able to transduce unmanipulated cells. Their mechanism of entry into cells partly involves lipid rafts and a portion of the internalised protein is directed to the Golgi. CONCLUSIONS: Generation of secretable TAT-coupled inhibitors of signaling pathways, able to transduce other cells can be achieved. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide key information that will assist in the design of TAT-inhibitors and engineered cells in order to regulate cell function within tissues.",M3
19089297,"Enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by dendritic cells loaded with <e>Tat</e>-protein transduction domain-fused hepatitis B virus core antigen.The protein transduction domain (PTD) of human immunodeficiency virus-1-Tat protein has a unique potency to penetrate the cellular membranes. To synthesize the sequence of Tat-PTD47-57 and hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg), we spliced these sequences and linked a fusion gene into the pMAL-c2x vector. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and pulsed with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and the transduction of recombinant protein was detected by immunofluorescence antibody assay. Results showed that recombinant PTD-HBcAg could penetrate into DC cytoplasm while recombinant HBcAg was detected on the surface of cells. The percentage of DC surface molecules, such as CD80, CD86 and major histocompatibility complex II, and production of cytokine (IL-12p70) induced by recombinant PTD-HBcAg were significantly higher than those induced by recombinant HBcAg or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. DCs treated with PTD-HBcAg induced T cells to differentiate into specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and enhanced the CTL killing response. In conclusion, the expressed and purified PTD-HBcAg fusion protein could penetrate into cells through the plasma membrane, promote DC maturation, and enhance T cells response to generate HBcAg-specific CTLs efficiently.",M3
19059290,"Improved transfection of spleen-derived antigen-presenting cells in culture using TATp-liposomes.Antigen presenting cells (APC) are among the most important cells of the immune system since they link the innate and the adaptative immune responses, directing the type of immune response to be elicited. To modulate the immune response in immune preventing or treating therapies, gene delivery into immunocompetent cells could be used. However, APC are very resistant to transfection. To increase the efficiency of APC transfection, we have used liposome-based lipoplexes additionally modified with cell-penetrating <e>TAT</e> peptide (TATp) for better intracellular delivery of a model plasmid encoding for the enhanced-green fluorescent protein (pEGFP). pEGFP-bearing lipoplexes made of a mixture of PC:Chol:DOTAP (60:30:10 molar ratio) with the addition of 2% mol of polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) conjugate (plain-L) or TATp-PEG-PE (TATp-L) were shown to effectively protect the incorporated DNA from degradation. Uptake assays of rhodamine-labeled lipoplexes and transfections with the EGFP reporter gene were performed with APC derived from the mouse spleen. TATp-L-based lipoplexes allowed for significantly enhanced both, the uptake and transfection in APC. Such a tool could be used for the APC transfection as a first step in immune therapy.",M3
19049517,"The twin-arginine translocation (<e>Tat</e>) systems from Bacillus subtilis display a conserved mode of complex organization and similar substrate recognition requirements.The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, membrane-bound TatABC subunits are all essential for activity, whereas Gram-positive bacteria usually contain only TatAC subunits. In Bacillus subtilis, two TatAC-type systems, TatAdCd and TatAyCy, operate in parallel with different substrate specificities. Here, we show that they recognize similar signal peptide determinants. Both systems translocate green fluorescent protein fused to three distinct Escherichia coli Tat signal peptides, namely DmsA, AmiA and MdoD, and mutagenesis of the DmsA signal peptide confirmed that both Tat pathways recognize similar targeting determinants within Tat signals. Although another E. coli Tat substrate, trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, was translocated by TatAdCd but not by TatAyCy, we conclude that these systems are not predisposed to recognize only specific Tat signal peptides, as suggested by their narrow substrate specificities in B. subtilis. We also analysed complexes involved in the second Tat pathway in B. subtilis, TatAyCy. This revealed a discrete TatAyCy complex together with a separate, homogeneous, approximately 200 kDa TatAy complex. The latter complex differs significantly from the corresponding E. coli TatA complexes, pointing to major structural differences between Tat complexes from Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Like TatAd, TatAy is also detectable in the form of massive cytosolic complexes.",M3
19047062,"Cell entry of arginine-rich peptides is independent of endocytosis.Arginine-rich peptides are a subclass of cell-penetrating peptides that are taken up by living cells and can be detected freely diffusing inside the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. This phenomenon has been attributed to either an endocytic mode of uptake and a subsequent release from vesicles or to direct membrane penetration (transduction). To distinguish between both possibilities, we have blocked endocytic pathways suggested to be involved in uptake of cell-penetrating peptides. We have then monitored by confocal microscopy the uptake and distribution of the cell-penetrating transactivator of transcription (<e>TAT</e>) peptide into living mammalian cells over time. To prevent side effects of chemical inhibitors, we used genetically engineered cells as well as different temperature. We found that a knockdown of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a knock-out of caveolin-mediated endocytosis did not affect the ability of TAT to enter cells. In addition, the TAT peptide showed the same intracellular distribution throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus as in control cells. Even incubation of cells at 4 degrees C did not abrogate TAT uptake nor change its intracellular distribution. We therefore conclude that this distribution results from TAT peptide that directly penetrated (transduced) the plasma membrane. The formation of nonselective pores is unlikely, because simultaneously added fluorophores were not taken up together with the TAT peptide. In summary, although the frequency and kinetics of TAT transduction varied between cell types, it was independent of endocytosis.",M3
19038320,"The effect of the structure of small cationic peptides on the characteristics of peptide-DNA complexes.A series of transcriptional activator (<e>TAT</e>)-protein transduction domains (PTDs) modified with hydrophobic amino acids were used as model cationic amphiphilic peptides to study the effect of hydrophobicity on interaction of such peptides with plasmid DNA. The peptide-DNA complexes were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and gel electrophoresis to determine their size and electrokinetic properties at various +/- charge ratios. Peptides in solution were found to have a tendency to aggregate and the hydrodynamic size of the aggregates depends on the structure of peptide. Peptides with smaller hydrophobic residues at the N-terminal formed smaller complexes with DNA compared to the ones with larger hydrophobic tails. DNA complexes having peptides with more than one hydrophobic moiety at the N-terminal had a tendency to aggregate. Among the peptides having single hydrophobic amino acid at the N-terminal, DNA complexes of Tyr-TAT and Phe-TAT were found to be stable in solution. The size of the hydrophobic domain and the type of hydrophobic amino acid at the N-terminal of cationic amphiphilic peptides play an important role not only in the complex formation but also in stabilizing the system. The studies presented here indicate that there is a potential for strategic development of these peptides into potential non-viral gene delivery vectors.",M3
19029897,"Structural insights into the cyclin T1-<e>Tat</e>-TAR RNA transcription activation complex from EIAV.The replication of many retroviruses is mediated by a transcriptional activator protein, Tat, which activates RNA polymerase II at the level of transcription elongation. Tat interacts with Cyclin T1 of the positive transcription-elongation factor P-TEFb to recruit the transactivation-response TAR RNA, which acts as a promoter element in the transcribed 5' end of the viral long terminal repeat. Here we present the structure of the cyclin box domain of Cyclin T1 in complex with the Tat protein from the equine infectious anemia virus and its corresponding TAR RNA. The basic RNA-recognition motif of Tat adopts a helical structure whose flanking regions interact with a cyclin T-specific loop in the first cyclin box repeat. Together, both proteins coordinate the stem-loop structure of TAR. Our findings show that Tat binds to a surface on Cyclin T1 similar to where recognition motifs from substrate and inhibitor peptides were previously found to interact within Cdk-cyclin pairs.",M3
19016855,"Bioenergetic requirements of a <e>Tat</e>-dependent substrate in the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula hispanica.Twin-arginine translocase (Tat) is involved in the translocation of fully folded proteins in a process that is driven by the proton motive force. In most prokaryotes, the Tat system transports only a small proportion of secretory proteins, and Tat substrates are often cofactor-containing proteins that require folding before translocation. A notable exception is found in halophilic archaea (haloarchaea), which are predicted to secrete the majority of their proteins through the Tat pathway. In this study, we have analysed the translocation of a secretory protein (AmyH) from the haloarchaeon Haloarcula hispanica. Using both in vivo and in vitro translocation assays, we demonstrate that AmyH transport is Tat-dependent, and, surprisingly, that its secretion does not depend on the proton motive force but requires the sodium motive force instead.",M3
19013459,"Neuronal survival and resistance to HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> toxicity in the primary culture of rat fetal neurons.In this study we report that primary cultures of rat fetal neurons contain subpopulations of cells that may be sensitive or resistant to HIV-1 Tat neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that rapid binding/uptake of Tat 1-86 for 2 h was sufficient to trigger caspase activation and neurodegeneration in rat fetal midbrain cell cultures. The uptake of Tat was followed by an increase in MCP1 (CCL2) immunoreactivity. Approximately 70% of neurons were able to survive transient or continuous (7 days) Tat exposure. The surviving neurons did not contain bound/internalized Tat, but were able to interact with Tat after medium replacement. These neurons were resistant to Tat toxicity. In neurons that resisted the toxic effects of continuous and repeated Tat treatment, levels of NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor complex were significantly lower than in controls. We suggest that the subunit composition of NMDAR complexes may be important for the sensitivity of neurons to Tat toxicity.",M3
19011637,"Treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling Src from the NMDA receptor complex.Chronic pain hypersensitivity depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). However, clinical use of NMDAR blockers is limited by side effects resulting from suppression of the physiological functions of these receptors. Here we report a means to suppress pain hypersensitivity without blocking NMDARs, but rather by inhibiting the binding of a key enhancer of NMDAR function, the protein tyrosine kinase Src. We show that a peptide consisting of amino acids 40-49 of Src fused to the protein transduction domain of the HIV <e>Tat</e> protein (Src40-49Tat) prevented pain behaviors induced by intraplantar formalin and reversed pain hypersensitivity produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant or by peripheral nerve injury. Src40-49Tat had no effect on basal sensory thresholds, acute nociceptive responses or cardiovascular, respiratory, locomotor or cognitive functions. Thus, through targeting of Src-mediated enhancement of NMDARs, inflammatory and neuropathic pain are suppressed without the deleterious consequences of directly blocking NMDARs, an approach that may be of broad relevance to managing chronic pain.",M3
19007964,"Small ruminant lentivirus <e>Tat</e> protein induces apoptosis in caprine cells in vitro by the intrinsic pathway.The small ruminant lentiviruses, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and maedi visna virus (MVV) naturally cause inflammatory disease in goats and sheep, provoking chronic lesions in several different organs. We have previously demonstrated that in vitro infection of caprine cells by CAEV induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway (Rea-Boutrois, A., Pontini, G., Greenland, T., Mehlen, P., Chebloune, Y., Verdier, G. and Legras-Lachuer, C. 2008). In the present study, we used Tat deleted viruses and SLRV Tat-expression vectors to show that the SRLV Tat proteins are responsible for this apoptosis. We have also studied the activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9 by fluorescent assays in caprine cells expressing SRLV Tat proteins, and the effects of transfected dominant negative variants of these caspases, to show that Tat-associated apoptosis depends on activation of caspases-3 and -9, but not -8. A simultaneous disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential indicates an involvement of the mitochondrial pathway.",M3
18991745,"Inhibition of inflammation by a p38 MAP kinase targeted cell permeable peptide.p38 MAPK has been the key therapeutic target for multiple inflammation diseases. However, the clinical applications of p38 inhibitors, most of which target on the ATP binding groove in the kinase, have been held back, largely because of their limited specificity and severe side-effects. An alternative strategy to generate highly selective p38 inhibitor is to block the specific interaction in the p38 signal pathway. Based on the hypothesis that specific binding peptides targeting on the docking groove would interfere the intrinsic interaction between p38 and its partners, we have designed a fusion peptide containing 12aa p38 docking sequence derived from MKK3b and 11aa HIV-<e>TAT</e> transmembrane sequence to form a cell permeable peptide. The peptide specifically binds to p38, and aborts its interaction with upstream kinase as well as downstream substrates, and thus to inhibit p38 phosphorylation and its signaling. Furthermore, the induction and secretion of TNFalpha and other inflammatory factors by LPS are blocked in peptide treated cells and mice. Finally the peptide has been shown to significantly inhibit ear oedema in mice. Therefore, the peptide holds great potential as an anti-inflammation agent for the treatment of inflammation and its related diseases.",M3
18988730,"Visualizing the dynamics of viral replication in living cells via <e>Tat</e> peptide delivery of nuclease-resistant molecular beacons.In this study, we describe the use of nuclease-resistant molecular beacons (MBs) for the real-time detection of coxsackievirus B6 replication in living Buffalo green monkey kidney (BGMK) cells via Tat peptide delivery. A nuclease-resistant MB containing 2'-O-methyl RNA bases with phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages was designed to specifically target an 18-bp 5' noncoding region of the viral genome. For intracellular delivery, a cell-penetrating Tat peptide was conjugated to the MB by using a thiol-maleimide linkage. Presence of the Tat peptide enabled nearly 100% intracellular delivery within 15 min. When the conjugate was introduced into BGMK cell monolayers infected with coxsackievirus B6, a discernible fluorescence was observed at 30 min after infection, and as few as 1 infectious viral particle could be detected within 2 h. The stability and the intracellular delivery properties of the modified MBs enabled real-time monitoring of the cell-to-cell spreading of viral infection. These results suggest that the Tat-modified, nuclease-resistant MBs may be powerful tools for improving our understanding of the dynamic behavior of viral replication and for therapeutic studies of antiviral treatments.",M3
18979090,"RNA detection using peptide-inserted Renilla luciferase.A novel complementation system with short peptide-inserted-Renilla luciferase (PI-Rluc) and split-RNA probes was constructed for noninvasive RNA detection.

They display induced fit conformational changes upon binding to specific RNAs and trigger complementation or discomplementation of Rluc. Split-RNA probes were designed to reform the peptide binding site upon hybridization with arbitrarily selected target RNA. This set of recombinant protein and split-RNA probes enabled a high degree of sensitivity in RNA detection. In this study, we show that the Rluc system is comparable to Fluc, but that its detection limit for arbitrarily selected RNA (at least 100 pM) exceeds that of Fluc by approximately two orders of magnitude.",M3
18978042,"Relaxed specificity of the Bacillus subtilis TatAdCd translocase in <e>Tat</e>-dependent protein secretion.Protein translocation via the twin arginine translocation (TAT) pathway is characterized by the translocation of prefolded proteins across the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the membrane.

It was previously assumed that both TatAy and TatCy are essential for the translocation of the YwbN precursor. Through complementation studies, we now show that TatAy can be functionally replaced by TatAd when the latter is offered to the cells in excess amounts. Moreover, under conditions of overproduction, TatAdCd, in contrast to TatAyCy, shows an increased tolerance toward the acceptance of various Tat-dependent proteins.",M3
18837295,"CTL responses to regulatory proteins <e>Tat</e> and Rev in HIV-1 B'/C virus-infected individuals.OBJECTIVE: To characterize HIV-1 specific CTL responses to regulatory proteins Tat and Rev in HIV-B'/C virus-infected ART-naive individuals. METHODS: HIV-1-specific CTL responses were analyzed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptides spanning the consensus sequences of HIV-1 clade C Tat and Rev proteins. Statistical analysis and graphical presentation were performed using SIGMAPLOT 10.0 and SIGMASTAT 3.5. For samples with a positive response, the magnitude of CTL responses was compared between HIV-1 C proteins by Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the significance threshold was P&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Tat and Rev were frequently recognized, with 23% and 52% of the tested individuals having detectable responses to these proteins, respectively. Several immunodominant regions were detected in Rev. No significant correlation was observed between the magnitude and breadth of CTL responses to regulatory proteins and the control of virus replication in this study. CONCLUSION: Tat and Rev can serve as targets for HIV-1-specific CTL, and several immunodominant regions are detectable in Rev. Further characterization of epitopes and their role in virus control may shed light on pathogenesis of HIV-1 natural infection and also be useful for the design and testing of candidate vaccines.",M3
18852520,"Active component of Fatsia japonica enhances the transduction efficiency of <e>Tat</e>-SOD fusion protein both in vitro and in vivo.It has been reported that Tat-SOD can be directly transduced into mammalian cells and skin and acts as a potential therapeutic protein in various diseases. To isolate the compound that can enhance the transduction efficiency of Tat-SOD, we screened a number of natural products. 3-O-[beta-D-Glucopyranosyl(1--&gt;4)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl]- hederagenin (OGAH) was identified as an active component of Fatsia japonica and is known as triterpenoid glycosides (hederagenin saponins). OGAH enhanced the transduction efficiencies of Tat-SOD into HeLa cells and mice skin. The enzymatic activities in the presence of OGAH were markedly increased in vitro and in vivo when compared with the controls. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, we suggest that OGAH, the active component of Fatsia japonica, might change the conformation of the membrane structure and it may be useful as an ingredient in antiaging cosmetics or as a stimulator of therapeutic proteins that can be used in various disorders related to reactive oxygen species (ROS).",M3
18829756,"Epigenetic silencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription by formation of restrictive chromatin structures at the viral long terminal repeat drives the progressive entry of HIV into latency.The molecular mechanisms utilized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to enter latency are poorly understood. Following the infection of Jurkat T cells with lentiviral vectors that express <e>Tat</e> in cis, gene expression is progressively silenced. Silencing is greatly enhanced when the lentiviral vectors carry an attenuated Tat gene with the H13L mutation. Individual clones of lentivirus-infected cells showed a wide range of shutdown rates, with the majority showing a 50% silencing frequency between 30 to 80 days. The silenced clones characteristically contained a small fraction (0 to 15%) of activated cells that continued to express d2EGFP. When d2EGFP(+) and d2EGFP(-) cell populations were isolated from the shutdown clones, they quickly reverted to the original distribution of inactive and active cells, suggesting that the d2EGFP(+) cells arise from stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. The detailed analysis of transcription initiation and elongation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirms that Tat levels are restricted in the latently infected cells but gradually rise during proviral reactivation. ChIP assays using clones of latently infected cells demonstrate that the latent proviruses carry high levels of deacetylated histones and trimethylated histones. In contrast, the cellular genes IkappaB alpha and GAPDH had high levels of acetylated histones and no trimethylated histones. The levels of trimethylated histone H3 and HP1-alpha associated with HIV proviruses fell rapidly after tumor necrosis factor alpha activation. The progressive shutdown of HIV transcription following infection suggests that epigenetic mechanisms targeting chromatin structures selectively restrict HIV transcription initiation. This decreases Tat production below the levels that are required to sustain HIV gene expression.",M3
18829958,"HIV-1 clade-specific differences in the induction of neuropathogenesis.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) is common among clade B HIV-infected individuals, but less common and less severe among individuals infected with clade C HIV-1, suggesting clade-specific differences in neuropathogenicity. Although differences in neuropathogenicity have been investigated in vitro using viral proteins responsible for HAD, to date there are no virological studies using animal models to address this issue. Therefore, we investigated neuropathogenesis induced by HIV-1 clades using the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse HIV encephalitis model, which involves intracranial injection of macrophages infected with representative clade B (HIV-1(ADA)) or clade C (HIV-1(Indie-C1)) HIV-1 isolates into SCID mice. In cognitive tests, mice exposed to similar inputs of HIV-1 clade C made fewer memory errors than those exposed to HIV-1 clade B. Histopathological analysis of mice exposed to clade B exhibited greater astrogliosis and increased loss of neuronal network integrity. In vitro experiments revealed differences in a key characteristic of HIV-1 that influences HAD, increased monocyte infiltration. HIV-1(Indie-C1)-infected macrophages recruited monocytes poorly in vitro compared with HIV-1(ADA)-infected macrophages. Monocyte recruitment was HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> and CCL2 dependent. This is the first demonstration, ever since HIV neuropathogenesis was first recognized, that viral genetic differences between clades can affect disease severity and that such studies help identify key players in neuropathogenesis by HIV-1.",M3
18814276,"Preliminary in vivo evaluation of the protein transduction domain-modified ATTEMPTS approach in enhancing asparaginase therapy.Asparaginase (ASNase) is an enzyme drug presently approved for the induction of remission in the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The cytotoxic effect of ASNase is derived from its ability to deplete asparagine, an essential amino acid required by certain types of leukemia cells for protein synthesis and survival. Despite its efficacy in enhancing disease remission rate and prolonging complete remission duration in ALL patients, ASNase therapy is nevertheless confounded by a number of serious toxic effects, particularly to organs associated with high protein production (e.g., liver, pancreas), due to the systemic depletion of asparagine. Presented herein is a modified version of our previously established ATTEMPTS protein delivery system that carries the potential to permit a tumor specific, intracellular delivery of ASNase, thereby allowing for a significant reduction of ASNase-induced systemic toxicity. In a previous paper, we already demonstrated the in vitro feasibility of this heparin/protamine-regulated, <e>TAT</e>-mediated system in delivering ASNase directly into ASNase-sensitive murine lymphoma cells. In this article, we further validated the in vivo applicability of this system in animals harboring ASNase-encapsulated L5178Y lymphoma cells. Preliminary results showed that animals inoculated with L5178Y cells containing TAT-ASNase exhibited an extended survival rate of approximately 13% over those harboring L5178Y cells without the encapsulation of ASNase. Furthermore, the TAT-ASNase-treated mice also displayed a significantly improved hematological and liver histological status than the control groups. These findings bring promise to the use of the modified ATTEMPTS delivery system in achieving enhanced ASNase therapy.",M3
18828138,"Immunoprevalence of the CD4+ T-cell response to HIV <e>Tat</e> and Vpr proteins is provided by clustered and disperse epitopes, respectively.Recent studies have suggested including nonstructural proteins as Tat and Vpr in HIV vaccines. However, little is known about the CD4+ T-cell response that these small proteins induce in humans. We have therefore evaluated these responses by in vitro priming experiments of CD4+ T lymphocytes harvested in healthy donors. In the Tat protein, only one peptide primed CD4+ T cells of eight HLA unrelated healthy donors. T cells induced by this peptide recognized immature DC loaded with the native Tat protein and are restricted by multiple HLA-DR molecules, in agreement with its binding capacity. This peptide was therefore processed in an appropriate manner and was highly immunoprevalent. CD4+ T-cell response to Vpr peptides was more disperse and involved six different peptides depending on the HLA-DR molecules of the donors. Two overlapping peptides were T-cell stimulating in at least half of the donors. T-cell response to Vpr in multiple donors is the result of a combination of several CD4+ T-cell epitopes with good to moderate immunoprevalence. Altogether, our results show that the frequency of responders to HIV Tat or Vpr proteins relies on one or multiple CD4+ T-cell epitopes, respectively.",M3
18781143,"Cell-permeable peptide <e>Tat</e>-PSD-95 PDZ2 inhibits chronic inflammatory pain behaviors in mice.Inflammatory conditions can lead to persistent debilitating pain, and the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has been shown to play an important role in the processing of inflammatory pain. Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein, has been identified to interact with NMDARs at neuronal synapses of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the role of these interactions in the central sensitization of nociceptive processing has not been defined. In this study, we investigated the effect of disrupting NMDAR/PSD-95 interactions on chronic inflammatory pain behaviors. We constructed a fusion peptide, Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2, comprising the second PDZ domain of PSD-95, to disrupt specifically NMDARs/PSD-95 protein interactions. Western blot analysis showed that Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 intraperitoneally injected into mice was delivered intracellularly into neurons in the CNS. By in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we found that the Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 dose dependently inhibited the interactions between NMDARs and PSD-95. Furthermore, behavioral testing showed that mice given Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 exhibited significantly reduced complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic inflammatory pain behaviors compared to the vehicle-treated group. Our results indicate that by disrupting NMDAR/PSD-95 protein interactions, the cell-permeable fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 provides a new target and approach for chronic inflammatory pain therapy.",M3
18812201,"Modification of CEA with both CRT and <e>TAT</e> PTD induces potent anti-tumor immune responses in RNA-pulsed DC vaccination.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is expressed on human colon carcinomas, is well characterized, and continues to be a promising target for cancer immunotherapy in humans. To enhance the immunogenecity of CEA, we developed a fusion gene (CRT-TAT-DeltaCEA) of the TAT protein transduction domain (PTD) and calreticulin (CRT) with human CEA devoid of its signal sequences (DeltaCEA) and evaluated anti-tumor immunity using RNA-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccination. Mice vaccinated with DC by electroporation with mRNA encoding TAT-DeltaCEA (DC/TAT-DeltaCEA) and CRT-DeltaCEA (DC/CRT-DeltaCEA) had enhanced induction of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and increased numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells by ELISPOT, as compared to mice vaccinated with DC/DeltaCEA. DC/CRT-DeltaCEA and DC/TAT-DeltaCEA vaccines preferentially stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. The DC vaccine by electroporation with mRNA encoding CRT-TAT-DeltaCEA (DC/CRT-TAT-DeltaCEA) enhanced both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. DC/CRT-TAT-DeltaCEA had the additional effects of CRT and TAT PTD and enhanced the anti-tumor effect against CEA-expressing tumors compared to DC/CRT-DeltaCEA or DC/TAT-DeltaCEA. These findings suggest that modification of CEA with both CRT and TAT PTD induces potent anti-tumor immune responses in RNA-pulsed DC vaccination and may be a useful approach for DC-based immunotherapy.",M3
18721127,"Genetically modified adenoviral vector with the protein transduction domain of <e>Tat</e> improves gene transfer to CAR-deficient cells.The transduction efficiency of Ad (adenovirus) depends, to some extent, on the expression level of CAR (coxsackievirus and Ad receptor) of a target cell. The low level of CAR on the cell surface is a potential barrier to efficient gene transfer. To overcome this problem, PTD.AdeGFP (where eGFP is enhanced green fluorescent protein) was constructed by modifying the HI loop of Ad5 (Ad type 5) fibre with the Tat (trans-activating) PTD (protein transduction domain) derived from HIV. The present study showed that PTD.AdeGFP significantly improved gene transfer to multiple cell types deficient in expression of CAR. The improvement in gene transfer was not the result of charge-directed binding between the virus and the cell surface. Although PTD.AdeGFP formed aggregates, it infected target cells in a manner different from AdeGFP aggregates precipitated by calcium phosphate. In addition, PTD.AdeGFP was able to transduce target cells in a dynamin-independent pathway. The results provide some new clues as to how PTD.AdeGFP infects target cells. This new vector would be valuable in gene-function analysis and for gene therapy in cancer.",M3
18760470,"<e>TAT</e>-conjugated nanoparticles for the CNS delivery of anti-HIV drugs.We have shown that nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated to trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide bypass the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and increase the transport of the encapsulated ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (PI), across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) to the central nervous system (CNS). A steady increase in the drug parenchyma/capillary ratio over time without disrupting the BBB integrity suggests that TAT-conjugated NPs are first immobilized in the brain vasculature prior to their transport into parenchyma. Localization of NPs in the brain parenchyma was further confirmed with histological analysis of the brain sections. The brain drug level with conjugated NPs was 800-fold higher than that with drug in solution at two weeks. Drug clearance was seen within four weeks. In conclusion, TAT-conjugated NPs enhanced the CNS bioavailability of the encapsulated PI and maintained therapeutic drug levels in the brain for a sustained period that could be effective in reducing the viral load in the CNS, which acts as a reservoir for the replicating HIV-1 virus.",M3
18693018,"Design and SAR of new substituted purines bearing aryl groups at N9 position as HIV-1 <e>Tat</e>-TAR interaction inhibitors.Twenty-four purine derivatives bearing aryl groups at N9 position were designed and synthesized as HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction inhibitors. All the compounds showed high antiviral activities in inhibiting the formation of SIV-induced syncytium in CEM174 cells. Ten of them with low cytotoxicities were evaluated by Tat dependent HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT gene expression colorimetric enzyme assay in human 293T cells at a concentration of 30 microM, indicating effective inhibitory activities of blocking the Tat-TAR interaction. The aryl groups at N9 position affected the binding affinities between compounds and TAR RNA, showing some specificities of aryl groups to TAR RNA.",M3
18710415,"PPARalpha and PPARgamma effectively protect against HIV-induced inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors which down-regulate inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations of PPAR functions can contribute to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-induced dysfunction of brain endothelial cells. Indeed, treatment with HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (<e>Tat</e>) protein decreased PPAR transactivation in brain endothelial cells. We next stably over-expressed PPARalpha and PPARgamma in a newly developed cell line of human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cells). Tat-induced up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin were markedly attenuated in hCMEC/D3 over-expressing PPARalpha or PPARgamma. These results were confirmed in CCL2 and E-selectin promoter activity studies. Similar protective effects were observed in hCMEC/D3 after activation of PPARgamma by exogenous PPAR agonists (dPGJ(2) and rosiglitazone). PPAR over-expression also prevented Tat-induced binding activity and transactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Importantly, increased PPAR activity attenuated induction of IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin in hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. The protective effects of PPAR over-expression were reversed by the antagonists of PPARalpha (MK886) or PPARgamma (GW9662). The present data suggest that targeting PPAR signaling may provide a novel therapeutic approach to attenuate HIV-1-induced local inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells.",M3
18687210,"[Construction and identification of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector harboring fusion gene NT4-Apoptin-HA2-<e>TAT</e>]AIM: To construct a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector harboring fusion gene NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT, laying a foundation for gene therapy research of malignant tumors. METHODS: The Apoptin and HA2-TAT gene were inserted in pUC19/NT4 vector after digested with restriction enzyme. The fusion gene of NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT was sub-cloned into the shuttle plasmid of adeno-associated virus; the products were co-transferred into HEK-293 cell line with helper plasmid pAAV/Ad and adeno-plasmid pFG140.The recombinant adeno-associated virus was produced by homologous recombination of above 3 plasmids in HEK-293 cells and its titer was measured by quantitative dot blot hybridization. The effect of AAV-NT4-Apoptin -HA2-TAT on HepG2 cell line was measured by a colorimetric 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: The NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. High titer of recombinant adeno-associated virus was obtained by homologous recombination in HEK-293 cells (3.14 x 10(15) pfu/L). AAV-NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT had strong deduce apoptosis effect on HepG2 cells. Compared with Adeno-associated mock virus and in normal cell line NIH3T3, Aden-associated virus NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT significantly decreased the survival rate of HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: The recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding gene NT4-Apoptin-HA2-TAT has been successfully constructed in this experiment by molecular cloning and in vitro recombination techniques, laying a foundation for further research of gene therapy of cancer.",M3
18690739,"Shape effects of nanoparticles conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides (HIV <e>Tat</e> PTD) on CHO cell uptake.In order to probe the nanoparticle shape/size effect on cellular uptake, a spherical and two cylindrical nanoparticles, whose lengths were distinctively varied, were constructed by the selective cross-linking of amphiphilic block copolymer micelles. Herein, we demonstrate that, when the nanoparticles were functionalized with the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein (HIV Tat PTD), the smaller, spherical nanoparticles had a higher rate of cell entry into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells than did the larger, cylindrical nanoparticles. It was also found that nanoparticles were released after internalization and that the rate of cell exit was dependent on both the nanoparticle shape and the amount of surface-bound PTD.",M3
18675778,"Cellular uptake and membrane-destabilising properties of alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid chimeras: lessons for the design of new cell-penetrating peptides.Novel peptidomimetic backbone designs with stability towards proteases are of interest for several pharmaceutical applications including intracellular delivery. The present study concerns the cellular uptake and membrane-destabilising effects of various cationic chimeras comprised of alternating N-alkylated beta-alanine and alpha-amino acid residues. For comparison, homomeric peptides displaying octacationic functionalities as well as the <e>Tat</e>(47-57) sequence were included as reference compounds. Cellular uptake studies with fluorescently labelled compounds showed that guanidinylated chimeras were taken up four times more efficiently than Tat(47-57). After internalisation, the chimeras were localised primarily in vesicular compartments and diffusively in the cytoplasm. In murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the chimeras showed immediate plasma membrane permeabilising properties, which proved highly dependent on the chimera chain length, and were remarkably different from the effects induced by Tat(47-57). Finally, biophysical studies on model membranes showed that the chimeras in general increase the permeability of fluid phase and gel phase phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles without affecting membrane acyl chain packing, which suggests that they restrict lateral diffusion of the membrane lipids by interaction with phospholipid head groups. The alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid chimeras described herein exhibit promising cellular uptake properties, and thus represent proteolytically stable alternatives to currently known cell-penetrating peptides.",M3
18680158,"Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, not pyridoxal kinase, involves in long-term potentiation induction in the rat dentate gyrus.In this study, we investigated whether the expression of pyridoxal kinase (PLK) and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) are altered following long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, and whether <e>Tat</e>-PLK and Tat-PNPO transductions affect LTP induction and paired-pulse responses in the rat dentate gyrus (DG). PNPO immunoreactivity was markedly increased in dentate granule cells after the induction of LTP, but that of PLK was not. Tat-PNPO (20 and 200 microg/kg), but not Tat-PLK or vitamin B6 precursors, treatments, increased the efficiency of high frequency stimulus-induced potentiation of populations spike amplitude when compared with saline-, or Tat-protein-treated animals. These changes correlated with the alterations in PNPO activity and its immunoreactivity. In addition, Tat-PNPO transduction increased paired-pulse facilitation but had no effect on the fast and late paired-pulse inhibitions. These findings suggest that PNPO may play a role in activity-dependent regulation of PLP level in the brain, which is involved in LTP induction and paired-pulse facilitation but not in enhancement of GABAergic inhibition.",M3
18646838,"Improved cellular activity of antisense peptide nucleic acids by conjugation to a cationic peptide-lipid (CatLip) domain.Conjugation to cationic cell penetrating peptides (such as <e>Tat</e>, Penetratin, or oligo arginines) efficiently improves the cellular uptake of large hydrophilic molecules such as oligonucleotides and peptide nucleic acids, but the cellular uptake is predominantly via an unproductive endosomal pathway and therefore mechanisms that promote endosomal escape (or avoid the endosomal route) are required for improving bioavailability. A variety of auxiliary agents (chloroquine, calcium ions, or lipophilic photosensitizers) has this effect, but improved, unaided delivery would be highly advantageous in particular for future in vivo applications. We find that simply conjugating a lipid domain (fatty acid) to the cationic peptide (a CatLip conjugate) increases the biological effect of the corresponding PNA (CatLip) conjugates in a luciferase cellular antisense assay up to 2 orders of magnitude. The effect increases with increasing length of the fatty acid (C8-C16) but in parallel also results in increased cellular toxicity, with decanoic acid being optimal. Furthermore, the relative enhancement is significantly higher for Tat peptide compared to oligoarginine. Confocal microscopy and chloroquine enhancement indicates that the lipophilic domain increases the endosomal uptake as well as promoting significantly endosomal escape. These results provide a novel route for improving the (cellular) bioavailability of larger hydrophilic molecules.",M3
18667497,"Targeting <e>tat</e> inhibitors in the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription complexes.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is regulated by the viral Tat protein, which relieves a block to elongation by recruiting an elongation factor, P-TEFb, to the viral promoter. Here, we report the discovery of potent Tat inhibitors that utilize a localization signal to target a dominant negative protein to its site of action. Fusing the Tat activation domain to some splicing factors, particularly to the Arg-Ser (RS) domain of U2AF65, creates Tat inhibitors that localize to subnuclear speckles, sites where pre-mRNA processing factors are stored for assembly into transcription complexes. A U2AF65 fusion named T-RS interacts with the nonphosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) via its RS domain and is loaded into RNAP II holoenzyme complexes. T-RS is recruited efficiently to the HIV-1 promoter in a TAR-independent manner before RNAP II hyperphosphorylation but not to cellular promoters. The  preloading  of T-RS into HIV-1 preinitiation complexes prevents the entry of active Tat molecules, leaving the complexes in an elongation-incompetent state and effectively suppressing HIV-1 replication. The ability to deliver inhibitors to transcription complexes through the use of targeting/localization signals may provide new avenues for designing viral and transcription inhibitors.",M3
18625037,"Identification of new HIV-1 Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in BALB/c mice.BACKGROUND: As HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells play a key role during acute and chronic HIV-1 infection in humans, the ability of potential anti-HIV vaccines to elicit strong, broad T cell responses is likely to be crucial. The HIV-1 Gag antigen is widely considered a relevant antigen for the development of an anti-HIV vaccine since it is one of the most conserved viral proteins and is also known to induce T cell responses. In the majority of studies reporting Gag-specific cellular immune responses induced by Gag-based vaccines, only a small number of Gag T cell epitopes were tested in preclinical mouse models, thus giving an incomplete picture of the numerous possible cellular immune responses against this antigen. As is, this partial knowledge of epitope-specific T cell responses directed to Gag will unavoidably result in a limited preclinical evaluation of Gag-based vaccines. RESULTS: In this study we identified new Gag CD8+ T cell epitopes in BALB/c mice vaccinated with the HIV-1 Gag antigen alone or in combination with the HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> protein, which was recently shown to broaden T cell responses directed to Gag. Specifically, we found that CTL responses to Gag may be directed to nine different CTL epitopes, and four of these were mapped as minimal CTL epitopes. CONCLUSION: These newly identified CTL epitopes should be considered in the preclinical evaluation of T cell responses induced by Gag-based vaccines in mice.",M3
18644411,"Internalisation of polymeric nanosensors in mesenchymal stem cells: analysis by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.The aim of this study was to demonstrate that flow cytometry and confocal microscopy could be applied in a complementary manner to analyse the internalisation of polymeric nanosensors in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The two techniques are able to provide en masse data analysis of nanosensors from large cell populations and detailed images of intracellular nanosensor localisation, respectively. The polyacrylamide nanosensors used in this investigation had been modified to contain free amine groups which were subsequently conjugated to <e>Tat</e> peptide, which acted as a delivery vector for nanosensor internalisation. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the health of MSC culture and assess the impact of nanosensor internalisation. MSC were characterised using fluorescently tagged CD cell surface markers that were also used to show that nanosensor internalisation did not negatively impact on MSC culture. Additionally it was shown that flow cytometry can be used to measure fluorophores located both on the cell surface and internalised within the cell. Complementary data was obtained using confocal microscopy to confirm nanosensor internalisation within MSC.",M3
18595131,"Secretory Transactivating Transcription-apoptin fusion protein induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.AIM: To determine whether SP-<e>TAT</e>-apoptin induces apoptosis and also maintains its tumor cell specificity. METHODS: In this study, we designed a secretory protein by adding a secretory signal peptide (SP) to the N terminus of Transactivating Transcription (TAT)-apoptin (SP-TAT-apoptin), to test the hypothesis that it gains an additive bystander effect as an anti-cancer therapy. We used an artificial human secretory SP whose amino acid sequence and corresponding cDNA sequence were generated by the SP hidden Markov model. RESULTS: In human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells, SP-TAT-apoptin expression showed a diffuse pattern in the early phase after transfection. After 48 h, however, it translocated into the nuclear compartment and caused massive apoptotic cell death, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and annexin-V binding assay. SP-TAT-apoptin did not, however, cause any cell death in non-malignant human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Most importantly, the conditioned medium from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with SP-TAT-apoptin also induced significant cell death in HepG2 cells, but not in HUVECs. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrated that SP-TAT-apoptin induces apoptosis only in malignant cells, and its secretory property might greatly increase its potency once it is delivered in vivo for cancer therapy.",M3
18596090,"Functional analysis of the complex trans-activating response element RNA structure in simian immunodeficiency virus.Transcription of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is activated through binding of the viral <e>Tat</e> protein to the trans-activating response (TAR) element at the 5' end of the nascent transcript. Whereas HIV type 1 (HIV-1) TAR folds a simple hairpin structure, the corresponding domains of HIV-2 and SIVmac exhibit a more complex structure composed of three stem-loops. This structural polymorphism may be attributed to additional functions of TAR in HIV-2/SIVmac replication. We recently constructed an SIVmac variant that does not require the Tat-TAR interaction for transcription. We used this variant to study additional roles of TAR in SIVmac replication and generated mutants with a truncated TAR structure. We demonstrate that partial or nearly complete removal of TAR does not impair viral transcription, RNA processing, and translation. Moreover, these deletions do not significantly affect virus replication in the PM1 T-cell line and macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that the complex TAR structure in SIVmac has no other essential function in virus replication in vitro besides its role in Tat-mediated activation of transcription.",M3
18573624,"Effects of menstrual cycle on gene transfection through mouse vagina for DNA vaccine.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections mainly occur through the vaginal and rectal mucosal membranes. In the present study, to develop a DNA vaginal vaccine against viral and bacterial infections, the effects of the menstrual cycle on DNA transfection through the vaginal mucosa in female mice and transfection enhancement by electroporation, a chelating agent, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) and nuclear localizing signals (NLS) were investigated. The transfection efficiencies of a marker plasmid DNA (pDNA), pCMV-Luc, on the vaginal mucosal membrane in mice at the stages of metestrus and diestrus were significantly higher than those at the stages of proestrus and estrus. The gene expression was markedly enhanced by electroporation and by pretreatment with the chelating agent. The highest level of expression was obtained by 2h pretreatment with 5% citric acid solution combined with electroporation with 15 pulses at 250 V/cm for 5 milliseconds (ms). Furthermore, a synergistic promoting effect on pDNA transfection was obtained by co-administration of CPP, the <e>Tat</e> peptide analog, and NLS, the NF-kappaB analog. These results indicate that effective DNA vaccination administered through the vaginal tract is possible by selecting the menstrual stage and overcoming the mucosal barrier using a combination of methods that promotes uptake.",M3
18574026,"<e>TAT</e>-mediated intracellular delivery of NPM-derived peptide induces apoptosis in leukemic cells and suppresses leukemogenesis in mice.Nucleophosmin (NPM) is frequently overexpressed in leukemias and other tumors. NPM has been reported to suppress oncogene-induced senescence and apoptosis and may represent a therapeutic target for cancer. We fused a NPM-derived peptide to the HIV-TAT (TAT-NPMDeltaC) and found that the fusion peptide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptotic death of primary fibroblasts and preleukemic stem cells. TAT-NPMDeltaC down-regulated several NF-kappaB-controlled survival and inflammatory proteins and suppressed NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene activities. Using an inflammation-associated leukemia model, we demonstrate that TAT-NPMDeltaC induced proliferative suppression and apoptosis of preleukemic stem cells and significantly delayed leukemic development in mice. Mechanistically, TAT-NPMDeltaC associated with wild-type NPM proteins and formed complexes with endogenous NPM and p65 at promoters of several antiapoptotic and inflammatory genes and abrogated their transactivation by NF-kappaB in leu-kemic cells. Thus, TAT-delivered NPM peptide may provide a novel therapy for inflammation-associated tumors that require NF-kappaB signaling for survival.",M3
18551626,"Morphine causes rapid increases in glial activation and neuronal injury in the striatum of inducible HIV-1 <e>Tat</e> transgenic mice.HIV encephalitis (HIVE) is accompanied by brain inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and glial activation, and HIV patients who abuse opiates are more likely to develop HIVE. To better understand how opiates could alter HIV-related brain inflammation, the expression of astrocyte (GFAP immunoreactivity) and macrophage/microglial (F4/80 or Mac1 immunoreactivity) markers in the striatum, and the percentage of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) positive macrophages/microglia, was determined following a 2-day exposure to morphine (5 mg/kg/day via time-release, subcutaneous implant) and doxycycline in GFAP-driven, doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice. Data show that both morphine and Tat induction via doxycycline increased astrocyte activation, with significant additive increases achieved with combined morphine and doxycycline exposure. By contrast, combined Tat induction and morphine exposure, but neither manipulation alone, significantly increased the proportion of macrophages/microglia present in the striatum of transgenic mice, although morphine exposure was necessary to elevate 3-NT co-detection in Mac1-positive macrophages/microglia. Finally, Tat induction increased the percentage of neurons expressing active caspase-3, and this was even more significantly elevated by co-administration of morphine. In spite of elevations in caspase-3, neuronal TUNEL reactivity was unchanged in all groups, even after 10 days of Tat induction. Importantly, co-administration of naltrexone completely antagonized the effects of morphine. These findings indicate that morphine rapidly and significantly increases the activation of astrocytes and macrophages/microglia in the brains of inducible Tat transgenic mice, supporting the theory that early inflammatory changes in glia could underlie the development of HIVE in opiate-abusing AIDS patients.",M3
18571668,"Organelle-targeted delivery of biological macromolecules using the protein transduction domain: potential applications for Peptide aptamer delivery into the nucleus.Extensive effort is currently being expended on the innovative design and engineering of new molecular carrier systems for the organelle-targeted delivery of biological cargoes (e.g., peptide aptamers or biological proteins) as tools in cell biology and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Although cell-permeable <e>Tat</e> peptides are useful carriers for delivering biological molecules into the cell, much internalized Tat-fused cargo is trapped within macropinosomes and thus not delivered into organelles. Here, we devised a novel intracellular targeting technique to deliver Tat-fused cargo into the nucleus using an endosome-disruptive peptide (hemagglutinin-2 subunit) and a nuclear localization signal peptide. We show for the first time that Tat-conjugated peptide aptamers can be selectively delivered to the nucleus by using combined hemagglutinin-2 subunit and nuclear localization signal peptides. This nuclear targeting technique resulted in marked enhancement of the cytostatic activity of a Tat-fused p53-derived peptide aptamer against human MDM2 (mouse double minute 2) that inhibits p53-MDM2 binding. Thus, our technique provides a unique methodology for the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on intracellular targeting.",M3

Tat peptide, plasmid DNA (pIRES2-EGFP-HGF) and Lipofectamine 2000 were used to prepare the TDL compound. Microbubbles were prepared using mechanic vibration. The expression of the report gene enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was observed using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The viability of HUVEC was measured by MTT assay. mRNA and protein of HGF was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot. The intensity of green fluorescence and the gene transfection efficiency of TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group were higher than those of other groups, and no significantly different viability was found between TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group and the other groups. The HGF mRNA and HGF protein of TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group were higher than those of other groups. Our finding demonstrated that UTMD could enhance the transfection efficiency of TDL compound without obvious effects on the cell viability of HUVEC, suggesting that the combination of UTMD and TDL compound might be a useful tool for the gene therapy of ischemic heart disease.",M3
18543336,"Therapeutic benefits of intrathecal protein therapy in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.When fused with the protein transduction domain (PTD) derived from the human immunodeficiency virus <e>TAT</e> protein, proteins can cross the blood-brain barrier and cell membrane and transfer into several tissues, including the brain, making protein therapy feasible for various neurological disorders. We have constructed a powerful antiapoptotic modified Bcl-X(L) protein (originally constructed from Bcl-X(L)) fused with PTD derived from TAT (TAT-modified Bcl-X(L)), and, to examine its clinical effectiveness in a mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), transgenic mice expressing human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) bearing a G93A mutation were treated by intrathecal infusion of TAT-modified Bcl-X(L). We demonstrate that intrathecally infused TAT-fused protein was effectively transferred into spinal cord neurons, including motor neurons, and that intrathecal infusion of TAT-modified Bcl-X(L) delayed disease onset, prolonged survival, and improved motor performance. Histological studies show an attenuation of motor neuron loss and a decrease in the number of cleaved caspase 9-, cleaved caspase 3-, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the lumbar cords of TAT-modified Bcl-X(L)-treated G93A mice. Our results indicate that intrathecal protein therapy using a TAT-fused protein is an effective clinical tool for the treatment of ALS.",M3
18466992,"Analysis of Jembrana disease virus mRNA transcripts produced during acute infection demonstrates a complex transcription pattern.Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is an unusual bovine lentivirus that causes an acute disease syndrome with a 20% case fatality rate after a short incubation period in Bos javanicus (Bali cattle) in Indonesia. Analysis of <e>tat</e> mRNA transcription patterns has identified up to six differently spliced transcripts indicating that, in common with other lentiviruses, JDV uses a complex splicing pattern. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA transcripts produced during the acute phase of infection with JDV(TAB/87) revealed at least 12 differently spliced transcripts involving 9 different splice sites. A single unspliced gag/pol transcript, singly spliced vif and tmx specific transcripts and alternatively spliced env, tat and rev transcripts were identified. A 67 nucleotide putative non-coding exon was identified that shared the same splice acceptor (SA) as vif and was incorporated into alternative transcripts of tat, rev and env.",M3
18497608,"Trans-activator of transcription-mediated delivery of NEP1-40 protein into brain has a neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral ischemic injury via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis.BACKGROUND: The Nogo-66 antagonistic peptide (NEP1-40) is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention of neuronal injury. However, delivery of the proteins across the blood-brain barrier is severely limited by its size and biochemical properties. The current study was designed to evaluate the transducible effects of the trans-activator of transcription (<e>TAT</e>) transduction system for NEP1-40 to cross the blood-brain barrier and to clarify whether intraperitoneal administration of TAT-NEP1-40 could protect cerebral neurons from ischemic injury. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to a 120-min focal ischemia and received an intraperitoneal injection of No-TAT-NEP1-40, TAT-NEP1-40, TAT-beta-galactosidase, or vehicle. The existence of the proteins in the brain was analyzed with immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques at 6 h after injection. Brain ischemic injury was evaluated by neurologic deficit scores, infarction volumes, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP-biotin nick end labeling staining, and assay of caspase-3 activity. RESULTS: Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of TAT-NEP1-40 protein in the brains 6 h after injection. Intraperitoneal injection of TAT-NEP1-40 could attenuate the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells and activated caspase-3 positive cells, and increase the viability of the cells in the ischemic bounder zone, compared with that treated with No-TAT-NEP1-40, TAT-beta-Gal, or vehicle. Furthermore, treatment with TAT-NEP1-40 significantly improved the neurologic outcomes and reduced the size of the infarction in rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the TAT-NEP1-40 could be efficiently delivered into the rat brains and improve ischemia-induced neurologic outcomes through attenuating cell apoptosis in ischemic brains.",M3
18431124,"Effect of disrupting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-postsynaptic density protein-95 interactions on the threshold for halothane anesthesia in mice.BACKGROUND: The authors' previous studies have shown that clinically relevant concentrations of inhalational anesthetics dose-dependently and specifically inhibit the PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-mediated protein interactions between postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and that the knockdown of spinal PSD-95 by intrathecal injection of PSD-95 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide significantly reduces the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration for isoflurane in rats. METHODS: The authors constructed a fusion peptide, <e>Tat</e>-PSD-95 PDZ2, comprising the second PDZ domain of PSD-95, which can specifically disrupt PSD-95 PDZ2-mediated protein interactions by binding to its interaction partner. By intraperitoneal injection of this fusion peptide into mice, the authors investigated the effect of disrupting the PSD-95 PDZ2-mediated protein interactions on the threshold for halothane anesthesia. RESULTS: Systemically injected fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 was delivered into the central nervous system, disrupted the protein-protein interactions between N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2 subunits and PSD-95, and significantly reduced the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration and righting reflex EC50 for halothane. CONCLUSIONS: By disrupting PSD-95 PDZ2 domain-mediated protein interactions, intraperitoneal injection of cell-permeant fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 dose-dependently reduces the threshold for halothane anesthesia. These results suggest that PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions at synapses in the central nervous system might play an important role in the molecular mechanisms of halothane anesthesia.",M3
18455803,"Quantitative evaluation of chaperone activity and neuroprotection by different preparations of a cell-penetrating Hsp70.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as the one derived from the human immunodeficiency virus <e>Tat</e> protein, facilitate the delivery of cargoes across cellular membranes. However, questions about the therapeutic potential of CPP-mediated delivery remain. For instance, the impact of the purification procedure on the functionality of Tat-fusion proteins has not been systematically examined. Here, we isolated fusion proteins of the chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the Tat CPP under denaturing or native conditions. To investigate the therapeutic potential of different recombinant protein preparations, we examined Tat-Hsp70 transduction efficiency and quantified Tat-Hsp70-mediated folding of a chaperone-dependent yellow fluorescent protein in vitro. Transduction efficiency and chaperone activity of Tat-Hsp70-treated cells was significantly higher compared to cells treated with Hsp70. The application of native isolated Tat-Hsp70 had the strongest effect. This chaperone activity correlates with increased viability of cells treated with the recombinant protein after cell death induction with 6-hydroxydopamine. This suggests that the method of recombinant Tat-fusion protein purification influences its functionality. For Tat-Hsp70, the method of choice seems to be isolation under native conditions, for which we present a purification protocol. Our results may contribute to improve Tat-fusion protein application in basic research and may facilitate its use as therapeutic tool, for instance in Parkinson's disease.",M3
18418067,"p14ARF is capable of promoting HIV-1 <e>tat</e> degradation.The p14(ARF) tumor suppressor functions as 'oncogenic checkpoint' that prevents unrestricted cellular proliferation in response to oncogenic signaling. Albeit, the major pathway through which ARF operates is the ARF-Mdm2-p53 axis, ARF directly binds to and inactivates transcription function of a number of DNA-bound activators. In the present study we show that p14(ARF) inhibits transcription activation of HIV-1 LTR promoter activity by Tat protein. Tat protein is a RNA-bound transcriptional activator whose function is strictly required for HIV-1 replication. We determined that p14(ARF) inhibits Tat transactivation of HIV-1 LTR by promoting Tat degradation via an ubiquitin-independent pathway.",M3

18397318,"Study of uptake of cell penetrating peptides and their cargoes in permeabilized wheat immature embryos.The uptake of five fluorescein labeled cell-penetrating peptides (<e>Tat</e>, Tat(2), mutated-Tat, peptide vascular endothelial-cadherin and transportan) was studied in wheat immature embryos. Interestingly, permeabilization treatment of the embryos with toluene/ethanol (1 : 20, v/v with permeabilization buffer) resulted in a remarkably higher uptake of cell-penetrating peptides, whereas nonpermeabilized embryos failed to show significant cell-penetrating peptide uptake, as observed under fluorescence microscope and by fluorimetric analysis. Among the cell-penetrating peptides investigated, Tat monomer (Tat) showed highest fluorescence uptake (4.2-fold greater) in permeabilized embryos than the nonpermeabilized embryos. On the other hand, mutated-Tat serving as negative control did not show comparable fluorescence levels even in permeabilized embryos. A glucuronidase histochemical assay revealed that Tat peptides can efficiently deliver functionally active beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme in permeabilized immature embryos. Tat(2)-mediated GUS enzyme delivery showed the highest number of embryos with GUS uptake (92.2%) upon permeabilization treatment with toluene/ethanol (1 : 40, v/v with permeabilization buffer) whereas only 51.8% of nonpermeabilized embryos showed Tat(2)-mediated GUS uptake. Low temperature, endocytosis and macropinocytosis inhibitors reduced delivery of the Tat(2)-GUS enzyme cargo complex. The results suggest that more than one mechanism of cell entry is involved simultaneously in cell-penetrating peptide-cargo uptake in wheat immature embryos. We also studied Tat(2)-plasmid DNA (carrying Act-1GUS) complex formation by gel retardation assay, DNaseI protection assay and confocal laser microscopy. Permeabilized embryos transfected with Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex showed 3.3-fold higher transient GUS gene expression than the nonpermeabilized embryos. Furthermore, addition of cationic transfecting agent Lipofectamine 2000 to the Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex resulted in 1.5-fold higher transient GUS gene expression in the embryos. This is the first report demonstrating translocation of various cell-penetrating peptides and their potential to deliver macromolecules in wheat immature embryos in the presence of a cell membrane permeabilizing agent.",M3
18388927,"HIV <e>TAT</e> peptide modifies the distribution of DNA nanolipoparticles following convection-enhanced delivery.We evaluated gene transfer using PEGylated bioresponsive nanolipid particles (NLPs) containing plasmid DNA administered by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) into orthotopically implanted U87-MG tumors in rat brain. We hypothesized that attachment of the human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting transcriptional activator peptide (TATp) to pH-sensitive, reduction-sensitive NLPs would increase gene transfer. TATp was attached either directly to a phospholipid (TATp-lipid) or via a 2-kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a lipid (TATp-PEG-lipid). Incorporation of 0.3 mol% TATp-PEG into pH-sensitive NLPs improved transfection 100,000-fold compared to NLPs in culture. In the brain or implanted tumors, the TATp-PEG restricted NLP convection to regions adjacent to the infusion catheter. Gene transfer in the brain from TATp-PEG NLPs, measured by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, was substantially greater than from NLPs adjacent to the catheter. Gene transfer using TATp-PEG NLPs, measured by luciferase expression, was 8-12-fold greater than from a 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane/cholesterol cationic lipoplex but 13-27-fold less than from the NLPs. Brain luciferase expression was localized in perivascular macrophages. Thus a cationic ligand, such as the TATp-PEG-lipid, can dramatically increase gene expression in culture, in the normal brain, and in implanted tumors; however, restriction of NLP distribution to the vicinity of the infusion catheter reduces the absolute level of gene transfer.",M3
18373319,"Tracking of primary human hepatocytes with clinical MRI: initial results with <e>Tat</e>-peptide modified superparamagnetic iron oxide particles.The transplantation of primary human hepatocytes is a promising approach in the treatment of specific liver diseases. However, little is known about the fate of the cells following application. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could enable real-time tracking and long-term detection of transplanted hepatocytes. The use of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles as cellular contrast agents should allow for the non-invasive detection of labelled cells on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Experiments were performed on primary human hepatocytes to transfer the method of detecting labelled cells via clinical MRI into human hepatocyte transplantation. For labelling, Tat-peptide modified nano-sized superparamagnetic MagForce particles were used. Cells were investigated via a clinical MR scanner at 3.0 Tesla and the particle uptake within single hepatocytes was estimated using microscopic examinations. The labelled primary human hepatocytes were clearly detectable by MRI, proving the feasibility of this new concept. Therefore, this method is a useful tool to investigate the effects of human hepatocyte transplantation and to improve safety aspects of this method.",M3
18367519,"Contribution of CD8+ T cells to containment of viral replication and emergence of mutations in Mamu-A*01-restricted epitopes in Simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys.Here, we investigated the containment of virus replication in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by CD8(+) lymphocytes. Escape mutations in Mamu-A*01 epitopes appeared first in SIV <e>Tat</e> TL8 and then in SIV Gag p11C. The appearance of escape mutations in SIV Gag p11C was coincident with compensatory changes outside of the epitope. Eliminating CD8(+) lymphocytes from rhesus monkeys during primary infection resulted in more rapid disease progression that was associated with preservation of canonical epitopes. These results confirm the importance of cytotoxic T cells in controlling viremia and the constraint on epitope sequences that require compensatory changes to go to fixation.",M3
18366791,"Transduction of E2F-1 <e>TAT</e> fusion proteins represses expression of hTERT in primary ductal breast carcinoma cell lines.BACKGROUND: Telomerase expression is detectable in 81-95% of breast carcinomas and may serve as a therapeutic target. The objective of this study was to investigate repression of telomerase activity in primary ductal breast cancer cells through transcriptional regulation of the catalytic subunit hTERT. We hypothesized that inhibition of telomerase expression could be achieved via Tat mediated protein transduction of the repressor protein E2F-1. METHODS: Protein purification techniques were refined to yield biologically active Tat fusion proteins (TFPs) capable of transducing the breast cancer cell lines HCC1937 and HCC1599. Cell lines were treated with wildtype E2F-1 (E2F-1/TatHA), mutant E2F-1 (E132/TatHA) and a control Tat peptide (TatHA) for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated from treated cells, reverse transcribed and fold changes in gene expression for hTERT determined via real-time RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Significant repression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) was present in both HCC1937 and HCC1599 cells following treatment with E2F-1/TatHA. In HCC1937 cells, hTERT was repressed 3.5-fold by E2F-1/TatHA in comparison to E132/TatHA (p &lt; 0.0012) and the TatHA peptide controls (p &lt; 0.0024). In HCC1599 cells, hTERT was also repressed with E2F-1/TatHA treatment by 4.0-fold when compared to the E132/TatHA control (p &lt; 0.0001). A slightly lower hTERT repression of 3.3-fold was observed with E2F-1/TatHA in the HCC1599 cells when compared to the TatHA control (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that transduction of E2F-1/TatHA fusion proteins in vitro is an effective repressor of hTERT expression in the primary ductal breast cancer cell lines HCC1937 and HCC1599.",M3
18366309,"<e>Tat</e>-specific binding IgG and disease progression in HIV type 1-infected Ugandans.There are data to suggest that both the humoral and cellular immune responses directed against Tat are beneficial in delaying HIV disease progression. We examined the association between the occurrence of Tat-specific binding antibodies (Abs) and different parameters of HIV-1 disease progression. We generated eight Tat proteins, derived from HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D, and circulating recombinant form CRF01_AE. These proteins were used to screen for Tat-specific binding Abs by an ELISA. Using five Tat proteins, we investigated whether the occurrence of Tat-specific Abs within 2 years after seroconversion for the majority, affected disease progression over time among 126 participants using survival analysis and rate of CD4 decline. Of these, 52 participants with a sample at 1.5 and 4.5 years after seroconversion were further examined to study the effect of Tat-specific Ab loss or maintenance on disease progression. Finally, using all the eight Tat proteins, we also investigated whether specific Abs to these Tat proteins among 48 participants, grouped as rapid progressors (RP, n = 26) and long-term survivors (LTS, n = 22) according to their CD4 decline over time, affected disease progression. Survival analysis did not reveal any evidence of protection from progression by Tat-specific Abs. Comparison of rate of CD4 declines between individuals with and without Abs to any Tat protein showed only a small and borderline significant advantage of having Tat-specific Abs (p = 0.043). There was no correlation between either loss or maintenance of Tat-specific Abs and disease progression. Comparison of LTS with RP showed no evidence that Tat-specific Abs slows participants' disease progression. This study showed no evidence of a protective effect of having Tat-specific Abs among these Ugandan subjects.",M3
