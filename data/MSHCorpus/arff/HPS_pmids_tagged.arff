19654026,"Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of Araucaria hantavirus.Hantaviruses are rodent-borne RNA viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). From the first detection of infection in Brazil in 1993 until 2009, 1161 cases of HPS have been reported, with mortality rates of around approximately 40%. Currently, due to the absence of a vaccine or specific antiviral therapy, the only way to reduce mortality by hantavirus infection is a fast and precise diagnosis that allows for supportive clinical health care. To improve the detection of hantavirus infection, we developed monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against the nucleoprotein (rNDelta85) of the Araucaria hantavirus strain (ARAUV). The specificity of generated Mabs for rNDelta85 was demonstrated by western blot, indirect immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. These are the first monoclonal antibodies to be produced and characterized against the South American hantavirus strain, and may be of special interest in the development of diagnostic assays and epidemiological studies.",M1
19531307,"Knowledge and practices about hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in a cluster of Japanese communities in Argentina.OBJECTIVES: To provide information on hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) knowledge and practices among a cluster of the rural Japanese communities near La Plata in central Argentina, an area with confirmed HPS cases. Particular emphasis was placed on testing the hypothesis that there would be differences between household use of HPS prevention measures based on the head-of-household's knowledge of HPS. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed in three sections: (1) household demographic characteristics, (2) HPS knowledge, and (3) HPS preventive measures. Questionnaires were given to the household head or other adult representing the household at an HPS prevention seminar sponsored by the Japanese Association of La Plata in February 2007. Total HPS knowledge scores were dichotomized into high (equal to or more than the median knowledge score) and low (less than the median). Differences between the two household groups were categorized, according to the degree of HPS knowledge, and analyzed. RESULTS: The 86 households that responded accounted for about 72% of the total study households in the area. The median knowledge score of 5 (range: 0-9, of 10) divided the study households into two groups: high knowledge score group (n = 40) and low knowledge score group (n = 46). The findings suggest an association between a household's accurate HPS knowledge and its respective use of HPS preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study have important implications for taking further steps toward improved HPS management and prevention strategies.",M1
19395308,"Evidence of circulation of Laguna Negra-like hantavirus in the Central West of Brazil: case report.BACKGROUND: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has been reported with increasing frequency in some Brazilian regions, but information about viral genetic identification is still limited. Recently, the state of Mato Grosso, in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, experienced a growing number of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) cases but the genetic characterization of the causative hantavirus is still missing. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to identify the hantavirus strain involved in a fatal HPS case in the Central region of Brazil. STUDY DESIGN: Nested RT-PCR was conducted on blood clot samples from an HPS patient from Mato Grosso. PCR-positive samples were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were compared with reference samples. Viral antigens were detected by immunohistological analyses in lung and liver tissues. RESULTS: Analyses of the viral RNA isolated from the patient identified a Laguna Negra (LN)-like virus as the causative agent and histological analysis of lung sections were compatible with the genetic characterization. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of circulation and human infection by a Laguna Negra-like hantavirus in Brazil.",M1
18619568,"A serosurvey for hantavirus infection in wild rodents from the states of Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco, Brazil.Sera from 269 rodents obtained during the routine surveillance operations in plague areas of Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco states, Brazil were tested by ELISA for specific IgG antibodies against a recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of Araraquara hantavirus. ELISA-positive sera were submitted to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of the virus genome and later sequencing for identification of the viral variant. The samples from the state of Pernambuco were antibody negative, and although four from Rio de Janeiro were ELISA-positive, they failed to yield viral cDNA by RT-PCR. This is the first report of the presence of antibodies to a hantavirus among rodents from Rio de Janeiro and suggests the possibility of human cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in that state, although no case has yet been reported.",M1
18497244,"[Hantavirus infections]Hantaviruses are enveloped single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses that belong to the family Bunyaviridae. They are widely distributed and maintained in populations of specific insectivores or rodent host species (mice or rats). In their natural host, hantaviruses develop persistent and asymptomatic infections with lifelong virus shedding in excreta. Transmission to humans occurs via direct contact with faeces, urine and saliva of infected rodents, in particular by inhaling virus contaminated aerosol. There are a variety of virus types that occur in different geographic areas, dependent on the natural distribution of the host. Unlike asymptomatic infection in rodents, several types of hantaviruses cause acute febrile diseases in humans, known as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). In Germany, human hantavirus infections frequently represent as nephropathia epidemica (NE), a generally mild HFRS form with influenza-like symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache and gastrointestinal disorders. Kidney failure, a characteristic sign of hantavirus infections, is also common. German NE cases are primarily caused by Puumala viruses (PUUV) which naturally persist in the bank vole, a mouse species that is widely distributed in the whole area of Germany. During 2005 and 2007, in several regions of Southern and Western Germany there was an unexpected increase in PUUV-associated NE cases. Currently, 1687 symptomatic hantavirus infections have been reported until the end of 2007, which is the highest number of hantavirus diseases in Germany since the introduction of the German infection protective law (Deutsches Infektionsschutzgesetz) in 2001. Treatment of hantavirus infections is mainly supportive and involves intensive medical care. A specific antiviral therapy with ribavirin has been shown to be successful for treatment of HFRS patients in the early stage of disease. In Germany, there is no licensed vaccine applicable for the prevention of hantavirus diseases. Anti-infectious measures are, therefore, regarded to be the most effective strategy to prevent illnesses due to these emerging RNA viruses.",M1
19736383,"Hantavirus infection: a review and global update.Hantaviruses have the potential to cause two different types of diseases in human: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). HFRS, initially described clinically at the turn of the 20th century, occurs endemically in the Asian and European continents, while HPS, recognized as a clinical entity since 1993, represents the prototype of emerging diseases occurring in the Western hemisphere. Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 cases of HFRS are hospitalized each year world wide, with most of the cases occurring in the developing countries. The case fatality rate of HFRS varies from &lt;1% to 12% depending on the viruses. Although HPS is much smaller in number than HFRS, with approximately 200 HPS cases per year in the Americas, the average case fatality rate is 40%. The reported cases of hantaviral infection is increasing in many countries and new hantavirus strains have been increasingly identified worldwide, which constitutes a public health problem of increasing global concern. Hantaviral infection might be underestimated due to its asymptomatic and non-specific mild infection, and the lack of simple standardized laboratory diagnostics in hospitals, especially in the developing countries. This review summarizes the current knowledge on virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory diagnostics, treatment and prevention of hantaviruses and hantaviral infections.",M1
18032485,"Immune serum produced by DNA vaccination protects hamsters against lethal respiratory challenge with Andes virus.Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a highly pathogenic disease (40% case fatality rate) carried by rodents chronically infected with certain viruses within the genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae. The primary mode of transmission to humans is thought to be inhalation of excreta from infected rodents; however, ingestion of contaminated material and rodent bites are also possible modes of transmission. Person-to-person transmission of HPS caused by one species of hantavirus, Andes virus (ANDV), has been reported. Previously, we reported that ANDV injected intramuscularly causes a disease in Syrian hamsters that closely resembles HPS in humans. Here we tested whether ANDV was lethal in hamsters when it was administered by routes that more accurately model the most common routes of human infection, i.e., the subcutaneous, intranasal, and intragastric routes. We discovered that ANDV was lethal by all three routes. Remarkably, even at very low doses, ANDV was highly pathogenic when it was introduced by the mucosal routes (50% lethal dose [LD(50)], approximately 100 PFU). We performed passive transfer experiments to test the capacity of neutralizing antibodies to protect against lethal intranasal challenge. The neutralizing antibodies used in these experiments were produced in rabbits vaccinated by electroporation with a previously described ANDV M gene-based DNA vaccine, pWRG/AND-M. Hamsters that were administered immune serum on days -1 and +5 relative to challenge were protected against intranasal challenge (21 LD(50)). These findings demonstrate the utility of using the ANDV hamster model to study transmission across mucosal barriers and provide evidence that neutralizing antibodies produced by DNA vaccine technology can be used to protect against challenge by the respiratory route.",M1
17848067,"Emergence and persistence of hantaviruses.Hantaviral diseases have been recognized for hundreds of years but, until 1976, they had not been associated with an infectious agent. When Lee and colleagues isolated what is now known as Hantaan virus, the techniques they introduced allowed further investigations into the etiology of the classical hantavirus disease, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), now known to be caused by any of multiple hantaviruses. The discovery of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the New World, and that it also can be caused by any of multiple hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus), has opened an entire field of epidemiologic, virologic, molecular, behavioral, and ecologic studies of these viruses. There appears to be a single hantavirus-single rodent host association, such that understanding the idiosyncrasies of each rodent host species and the ecologic variables that affect them are recognized as critical if we are to reduce human risk for infection. This chapter summarizes what is known about hantaviruses with regard to history of these viruses, their taxonomy, recognized geographical distribution, ecologic factors impacting their maintenance and spread of hantaviruses, effect of rodent behavior on hantavirus transmission, influence of host factors on susceptibility to and transmission of hantaviruses, and transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to humans. In addition, we summarize all these complexities and provide suggestions for future research directions.",M1
17655929,"Hantavirus infection in East Asia.Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to the Hantavirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae. These viruses persistently infect their rodent reservoirs without causing disease. The virus is transmitted to humans via the inhalation of infectious aerosols generated from contaminated animal secretions or through the contaminated saliva of animal bites. Hantaviruses cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Euro-Asia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in North and South America. Here, we review the epidemiology and epizootiology of hantavirus infection in Asian countries.",M1
17475651,"Temporal analysis of Andes virus and Sin Nombre virus infections of Syrian hamsters.Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) are rodent-borne hantaviruses that cause a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). There are no vaccines or specific drugs to prevent or treat HPS, and the pathogenesis is not understood. Syrian hamsters infected with ANDV, but not SNV, develop a highly lethal disease that closely resembles HPS in humans. Here, we performed a temporal pathogenesis study comparing ANDV and SNV infections in hamsters. SNV was nonpathogenic and viremia was not detected despite the fact that all animals were infected. ANDV was uniformly lethal with a mean time to death of 11 days. The first pathology detected was lymphocyte apoptosis starting on day 4. Animals were viremic and viral antigen was first observed in multiple organs by days 6 and 8, respectively. Levels of infectious virus in the blood increased 4 to 5 logs between days 6 and 8. Pulmonary edema was first detected ultrastructurally on day 6. Ultrastructural analysis of lung tissues revealed the presence of large inclusion bodies and substantial numbers of vacuoles within infected endothelial cells. Paraendothelial gaps were not observed, suggesting that fluid leakage was transcellular and directly attributable to infecting virus. Taken together, these data imply that HPS treatment strategies aimed at preventing virus replication and dissemination will have the greatest probability of success if administered before the viremic phase; however, because vascular leakage is associated with infected endothelial cells, a therapeutic strategy targeting viral replication might be effective even at later times (e.g., after disease onset).",M1
17436235,"Hantavirus infection induces a typical myocarditis that may be responsible for myocardial depression and shock in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.Despite clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction, there is no pathological evidence of myocardial injury in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The dominant opinion is that the primary cardiac lesion is functional rather than structural. The present study describes hantaviral antigen and particles in the cardiac endothelium and interstitial macrophages in association with a typical myocarditis in HPS. Human hearts from 14 individuals who died of HPS were compared with hearts from 14 individuals who died of acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with acute lung injury and 4 individuals who died accidental deaths without thoracic injury (as controls); all cases were selected from autopsies. Transmural blocks of myocardial tissue were excised from the middle portion of the left-ventricular free wall and fixed in formalin. Small samples of myocardial tissue from 4 HPS cases and 4 non-HPS controls were fixed in glutaraldehyde for electron microscopic study. Histomorphometric, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural methods were employed to detect the presence of hantavirus in the myocardium and to evaluate interstitial edema and the minor diameter of myocytes, to characterize the immunophenotype, and to estimate the number of inflammatory cells and in situ cytokine-producing cells and the T helper cell subset 1 and 2 immune responses (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin [IL]-10, and IL-4). Cardiac remodeling; hantaviral antigen and particles in the endothelium and macrophages; scattered foci of myofiber necrosis; greater interstitial cellular infiltration, mainly composed of macrophages and memory T lymphocytes and a significant number of T helper and B lymphocytes; and TNF-alpha protein expression in macrophage-type cells and cardiomyocytes were observed to a greater extent in HPS myocardium than in normal and acute pancreatitis control myocardium. These findings give support to the opinion that structural changes could be responsible for myocardial depression and shock in HPS, and it should be properly named as  hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome  (HCPS).",M1
17405352,"A comparative epidemiological study of hantavirus infection in Japan and Far East Russia.Hantaviruses are causative agents of some severe human illnesses, including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The viruses are maintained by rodent hosts, and humans acquire infection by inhaling virus-contaminated excreta from infected animals. To examine the epidemiology of hantavirus infections in Japan and Far East Russia, we conducted epidemiological surveys in these regions. In Japan, anti-hantavirus antibodies were found in four rodent species, Clethrionomys rufocanus, Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, and Apodemus speciosus. Although no new HFRS cases have been officially reported over the past 20 years in Japan, one member of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force did test positive for hantavirus antibody. Repeated surveys in Far East Russia have revealed that two distinct hantavirus types cause severe HFRS in this region. Hantavirus sequences identified from A. peninsulae, fetal HFRS cases in Vladivostok, and Amur virus are highly similar to each other (&gt; 92% identity), but they are less similar (approximately 84% identity) to the prototypical Hantaan virus, which is carried by A. agrarius. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that Amur and A. peninsulae-associated viruses are distinct from Hantaan virus, suggesting that A. peninsulae is the reservoir animal for Amur virus, which causes severe HFRS. From HFRS patients in the Khabarovsk region, we identified viruses with nucleotide sequences that are more similar to Far East virus (&gt; 96%identity) than to the Hantaan (88-89% identity) or Amur (81-83% identity) viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that the viruses from Khabarovsk HFRS patients are closely related to the Far East virus, and distinct from Amur virus.",M1
17161316,"Andes Hantavirus as possible cause of disease in travellers to South America.BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses in Europe and Asia cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and epidemic nephritis (mortality rate &lt;1-15%). New strains of Hantaviruses cause Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) from Canada to South America. Andes virus mortality rate is about 30% in Chile. METHOD: Clinical charts of 54 patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Inhalation of aerosolized urine, faeces or saliva of rodents is the principal cause of infection. The incubation period is between 8 and 43 days. The main prodromal symptoms are: myalgias, fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, dyspnoea, petechiae and coughing. After the 4th day pulmonary oedema, hypotension and renal failure appear. Haemorrhagic disorders may occur. The first laboratory tests presenting alterations are: haemoconcentration, leukocytosis, low platelet count &lt;150 micro/L, and presence of immunoblasts. The treatment is supportive: mechanical ventilation, vasopressor drugs, haemofiltration or haemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There is no specific treatment for HPS. Preventive measures must be empathised. CONCLUSION: The principal risk factors for tourists are: accommodation in abandoned or closed up facilities; failure to use indicated pathways when walking in forests; camping outside recommended areas; drinking water from natural sources and fishing in risk areas. The risk of infection for foreign tourists in Chile is low.",M1
17133547,"Rapid immunochromatographic test for hantavirus andes contrasted with capture-IgM ELISA for detection of Andes-specific IgM antibodies.Hantavirus is associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The clinical diagnosis of hantavirus infections has been confirmed routinely by the immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A rapid and easy diagnostic test for hantavirus infection is required. A new immunochromatographic assay for hantavirus, POC-PUU, useful for the diagnosis of epidemic nephrophaty associated with hantavirus Puumala in Europe, was evaluated in Chile. This test is based on recombinant N-protein of hantavirus Puumala, and cross-reacts with other hantaviruses. Eighty human sera were selected at random from patients from Southern Chile who were suspected with HPS. The hantavirus capture-IgM ELISA was compared with a commercially available POC-PUU test (POC PUUMALA, Reagena Ltd., Toivala, Finland). The test sensitivity and specificity of the POC-PUU test were 97 and 90%, respectively. It is important to note that although the test is not specific for Andes virus the sensitivity and specificity were above 90%, which indicates good reactivity to the Puumala nucleoprotein antigen. As this test is cost-effective, with a high negative value, rapid and easy to carry out, specialized personnel are not necessary, nor does it require specialized equipment. Its usefulness for diagnosis is important in hospitals far from reference centers and areas with a high incidence of HPS cases.",M1
17110000,"Cross-reactive immune responses in mice after genetic vaccination with cDNA encoding hantavirus nucleocapsid proteins.Hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in about 150,000 individuals in Eurasia, and several hundred cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) on the American continent annually. There is consequently a need for rapid diagnostics and effective prevention of hantaviral infections. In this study we have performed DNA-vaccination of mice with full-length genes encoding the immunogenic nucleocapsid protein (NP) of Puumala (PUUV), Seoul (SEOV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV). The antibody reactivity towards the NPs, and deleted or truncated variants thereof, were studied to localise and investigate the major polyclonal B-cell epitopes. Our findings clearly show that the antibody reactivity in each immunised mouse is unique, not only in a quantitative respect (titers) but also in cross-reactivity and most likely also in the epitope specificity. Our experimental data in combination with B-cell prediction software indicate that strong homologous virus species specific and cross-reactive epitopes are located around amino acid residue 40 in the nucleocapsid proteins.",M1

There are no reports of hantavirus infections in humans from India, hence this pilot study was undertaken to provide the serological evidence of hantavirus infections in humans in south India. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from individuals with acute febrile illness and from voluntary blood donors, majority of whom were from south India. Serum samples were tested for anti-hantavirus IgM using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Samples found positive by the EIA were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using slides coated with Seoul virus (SEOV) infected cells as substrate. RESULTS: Of the 152 serum samples from individuals with pyrexic illness, 23 (14.7%) were positive for anti-hantavirus IgM by EIA. In contrast, only 5.7 per cent of healthy blood donors were positive by this assay. Eighteen of the 22 (82%) EIA-positive samples from patients were positive by the IFA assay. In contrast, only 2 of the 5 (40%) blood donor EIA positive samples were positive in the IFA assay. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: The finding of this study indicated the possible presence of hantavirus infections in the human population of India presenting both as asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Further studies need to be done to confirm the findings on a larger sample using molecular techniques.",M1
15964966,"Clinical survey of hantavirus in southern Brazil and the development of specific molecular diagnosis tools.Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is an emerging disease caused by an increasing number of distinct hantavirus serotypes found worldwide. It is also a very severe immune disease. It progresses quickly and is associated with a high mortality rate. At the prodrome phase, hantavirosis symptoms can resemble those of other infectious diseases such as leptospirosis and influenza. Thus, prognosis could be improved by developing a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for hantavirus infection, and by improving knowledge about clinical aspects of this disease. This study describes clinical features and laboratory parameters throughout the course of HPS in 98 patients. We report the seasonality and regional distribution of this disease in Paraná State, Brazil during the last seven years. In addition, we evaluated a specific molecular diagnostic test based on a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the detection of hantaviruses circulating in Brazil.",M1
15744574,"New ecological aspects of hantavirus infection: a change of a paradigm and a challenge of prevention--a review.In the last decades a significant number of so far unknown or underestimated pathogens have emerged as fundamental health hazards of the human population despite intensive research and exceptional efforts of modern medicine to embank and eradicate infectious diseases. Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be ascribed to agents that are zoonotic or expanded their host range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status of a pathogen to remain unnoticed or evolves into a worldwide threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social, and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens having gained more and more attention in the last decades. These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in hitherto unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Middle, and South America) with characteristic features affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing an acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century fundamentally changed our knowledge about the appearance of the hantavirus specific clinical picture, mortality, origin, and transmission route in human beings. The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners Region of the United States and had a lethality of more than 50%. Although the causative virus was first termed in connection with the geographic name of its outbreak region the analysis of the individual viruses indicate that the causing virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and consequently termed as Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are assumed to share a long time period of co-evolution with specific rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes normally coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases that are associated with hantavirus infections in rodents underlining the amicable relationship between virus and host developed by mutual interaction in hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the major reservoir, antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild animals like cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live jointly in a similar habitat. Therefore the transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals seems to be possible, if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of the co-habitat domestic animals possess adequate virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of species other than rodents as for example humans turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents focusing the attention on this virus group, their ecology and evolution in order to prevent the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on the influence of non-natural hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses are needed to understand the directions that the hantavirus evolution could pursue. At least, domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans particularly in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions have to be copiously screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other often incidental hosts is accompanied by a change of ecology, a change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors probably influencing the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment exerts a modified evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably to adopt a form that is much more dangerous for other host species compared to the original one.",M1
15702722,"[Emerging viral zoonoses: hantavirus infections]Hantaviruses are rodent-borne agents belonging to the Bunyaviridae family. These viruses, which are found throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas, are maintained by different species of rodents, in which they produce chronic, inapparent infections. Humans become infected through contact with urine, saliva or faeces from infected rodents, mainly via the aerosol route. In humans, clinical disease occurs in the form of two major syndromes: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome mainly occurs in Europe and Asia and HPS has only ever been reported in the Americas.

Although ANDV causes a lethal HPS-like disease in hamsters, SNV, and all other HPS-associated hantaviruses that have been tested, cause asymptomatic infections of laboratory animals, including hamsters. In an effort to understand the pathogenicity of ANDV in the hamster model, we generated ANDV/SNV reassortant viruses. Plaque isolation of viruses from cell cultures infected with both parental viruses yielded only one type of stable reassortant virus: large (L) and small (S) segments of SNV and M segment of ANDV. This virus, designated SAS reassortant virus, had in vitro growth and plaque morphology characteristics similar to those of ANDV. When injected into hamsters, the SAS reassortant virus was highly infectious and elicited high-titer, ANDV-specific neutralizing antibodies; however, the virus did not cause HPS and was not lethal. These data indicate that the ANDV M genome segment is not sufficient to confer the lethal HPS phenotype associated with ANDV.",M1
15211014,"High seroprevalence of hantavirus infection on the Azuero peninsula of Panama.The first outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in Central America was documented on the Azuero peninsula of Panama in late 1999 and 2000. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction evidence implicated only Choclo virus in symptomatic HPS with a mortality rate of 20%, although two rodent-borne hantaviruses (Choclo virus and Calabazo virus) were identified in the peridomestic habitat. Neighborhood serosurveys around case households found seroprevalence rates as high as 30%, the highest in the Americas except for western Paraguay. We report here population-based serosurveys for 1,346 adults and children in four communities, three on the Azuero peninsula and one in adjacent central Panama. Overall seroprevalence ranged from 33.2% in a population engaged in farming and fishing on Isla de Cañas, to 16.3% and 21.2% in two mainland agricultural communities, to 3.1% in central Panama, with a modest male predominance of 1.2:1. Nine percent of children 4-10 years old were seropositive, and seroprevalence increased with age in all communities, with highest levels of 52% in those 41-50 years old cohort on Isla de Cañas. Univariate analysis identified correlations between seroprevalence and multiple agricultural and animal husbandry activities. However, stepwise logistic regression models identified only raising animals (cows, pigs, goats, poultry) and fishing as significant independent variables. Human infection with hantavirus on the Azuero peninsula, either with Choclo virus or combined with Calabazo virus, is frequent but rarely results in hospitalization due to respiratory illnesses resembling HPS.",M1
14758117,"Hantavirus infection in children.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article focuses on recent developments in knowledge about hantavirus infections and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in children. We highlight clinical characterization, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic techniques, and current alternatives for treatment and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: After the first description of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in 1993 in the United States, new cases of HPS and new hantavirus species have been described throughout the Americas. The factors involved in the expression of hantavirus disease have, in part, been recognized, but there have been descriptions of newer viruses and newer rodent reservoirs. Several seroprevalence studies suggest that the virus-host interaction has been taking place for many years, and changes in human behavior and wild rodent ecology, sometimes secondary to industrial progress, facilitate the clinical recognition of disease. Sin nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV) are examples of the same disease with differences in the virus virulence and in the host response. The North American syndrome and the Southern HPS differ in epidemiologic patterns and in the spectrum of disease. SUMMARY: Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral drugs, vaccines, or immunotherapeutic agents are available for treatment of the disease, and therapy is primarily supportive. Intensive care medicine has played an outstanding role in decreasing the lethality of HPS. A ribavirin trial in the United States did not support the use of the drug in fully developed HCPS. Recently published data suggest that a strong neutralizing antibody response may be a predictor of effective clearance of and recovery from SNV infection. This has raised the possibility that passive immunotherapy may be useful in HCPS. Extensive work has been done to develop a hantavirus vaccine, but at present it seems unlikely that a vaccine will be in commercial development in the near future.",M1
14628942,"The complex ecology of hantavirus in Paraguay.Following an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the Paraguayan Chaco in 1995, Calomys laucha was identified as the rodent host for the hantavirus associated with these cases. To explore the possibility of additional hantaviruses in Paraguay, we collected 636 mammals from 10 of the 17 departments. Plasma from 27 animals in Alto Paraguay and Boquer6n in the Chaco and Neembucú and Itapúa in the eastern region had antibody to Andes virus antigens. Of these 27, five individuals (among four species) were positive for hantavirus RNA. Sera were collected from indigenous people in eastern Paraguay to ascertain whether persons were being infected with hantavirus outside of the Chaco. Seventeen percent were antibody-positive. These results suggest that several different hantaviruses are co-circulating in Paraguay, and that HPS cases occurring in eastern Paraguay may result from exposure to hantaviruses that are distinct from those in the Chaco.",M1
14595446,"Prevalence of infection with hantavirus in rodent populations of central Argentina.We studied hantavirus seroprevalence and virus variability in rodent populations in Diego Gaynor, northwest of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Rodent samplings were conducted in railroads and cropfield borders in March and July 1999, September and December 2000, and March 2001. Antibody detection was performed by an enzyme link immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using the recombinant nucleoprotein of Andes (AND) virus as antigen. Tissue samples were taken from positive antibody individuals in order to confirm the presence of hantavirus genomic material and to identify virus genotypes. Akodon azarae was the most abundant species, followed by Oligoryzomys flavescens, while Calomys laucha and C. musculinus were rarely caught. We found a rate of seroprevalence of 9.3% for a total sample of 291 A. azarae and 13.5% for 37 O. flavescens. After molecular analyses of hantavirus, we confirmed the presence of hantavirus genomic material in 16 individuals with ELISA (+) results and two individuals with ELISA (-). Four amplimers for each species were sequenced and compared to the corresponding sequences of representative hantaviruses. We identified the AND Cent Lec from three O. flavescens, and the Pergamino virus from four A. azarae and from one O. flavescens. A. azarae males had higher seroprevalence than females, and heavier individuals showed higher seroprevalence than lighter ones. We did not find seroprevalence differences according to sex in O. flavescens, although this result may have been produced by the low sample size. The lowest seroprevalence was found in a period of high rodent density, when juveniles prevailed in the population. We found higher seroprevalences than those detected in previous studies for other localities of central Argentina where cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) have been reported. The presence of AND Cent Lec virus in rodent populations of the study area, which is responsible of HPS cases in central Argentina, suggests that human populations are at risk of HPS disease, although there were not reported cases of this disease until today.",M1
14519242,"Hantavirus infection in humans and rodents, northwestern Argentina.We initiated a study to elucidate the ecology and epidemiology of hantavirus infections in northern Argentina. The northwestern hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>)-endemic area of Argentina comprises Salta and Jujuy Provinces. Between 1997 and 2000, 30 HPS cases were diagnosed in Jujuy Province (population 512,329). Most patients had a mild clinical course, and the death rate (13.3%) was low. We performed a serologic and epidemiologic survey in residents of the area, in conjunction with a serologic study in rodents. The prevalence of hantavirus antibodies in the general human population was 6.5%, one of the highest reported in the literature. No evidence of interhuman transmission was found, and the high prevalence of hantavirus antibody seemed to be associated with the high infestation of rodents detected in domestic and peridomestic habitats.",M1
12682619,"Hantaviruses: a tale of two hemispheres.Infectious febrile nephropathies, initially described as epidemics during military campaigns in Europe and Asia at the turn of the 20(th) century, were eventually all unified under the rubric of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and ascribed to infection from rodent-borne hantaviruses. At the end of the century, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) was described throughout the Americas as a consequence of infection with the New World hantaviruses. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these diseases are linked to the ecology of their associated rodent hosts. Murine rodents (Old World mice and rats) are associated with the severe forms of HFRS in Asia and the Balkans due to Hantaan, Dobrava, and Seoul viruses. Hantaan virus causes an estimated 50-100,000 infections a year in China alone. Arvicoline rodents (voles) are associated with a mild form of HFRS in Europe called nephropathia epidemica due to Puumala virus. Sigmodontine rodents (New World rats and mice) are associated with approximately 200 HPS cases per year throughout the Americas caused by over a dozen viruses. The viruses are mainly transmitted as small-particle aerosols of rodent excreta, and the subsequent infections share cardiovascular shock as a prominent feature, although HFRS causes predominantly renal disease, while HPS causes a predominantly non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema - hemorrhage involvement varies in the syndromes on the basis of virus subtypes. Efforts are underway to refine prevention strategies, understand the pathogenesis of the shock, and identify therapeutic modalities.",M1
12653299,"Experimental evaluation of rodent exclusion methods to reduce hantavirus transmission to residents in a Native American community in New Mexico.We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of rodent proofing continuously occupied homes as a method for lowering the risk for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) among residents of a Native American community in northwestern New Mexico. Rodent proofing of dwellings was paired with culturally appropriate health education. Seventy homes were randomly assigned to treatment or control categories. Treatment homes were rodent-proofed by sealing openings around foundations, doors, roofs, and pipes and repairing screens and windows. Repairs to each dwelling were limited to $500 US. After repairs were completed, 15-20 snap traps were placed in each treatment and control home and checked approximately every 2 days for an average of 3-4 weeks. During 23,373 trap nights, one house mouse (Mus musculus) was captured in one treatment home, and 20 mice (16 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, two Pinyon mice, Peromyscus truei, and two unidentified mice) were captured in five control homes (one house had 14 captures, two had two captures, and two had one capture). Trap success was 0.01% in treatment homes and 0.15% in controls. Intensity of infestation (mean number of mice captured per infested home) was 1 in treatment homes and 4 in controls. Observations of evidence of infestation (feces, nesting material, gnaw marks, or reports of infestation by occupant) per 100 days of observation were 1.2 in treatment homes and 3.1 in controls. Statistical power of the experiment was limited because it coincided with a period of low rodent abundance (August-November 2000). Nevertheless, these results suggest that inexpensive rodent proofing of occupied rural homes can decrease the frequency and intensity of rodent intrusion, thereby reducing the risk of HPS among rural residents in the southwestern United States.",M1
12653146,"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, 1993-1998.Between 1993 and 1998, 10 cases of clinical hantavirus infection were diagnosed in Brazil. Hantavirus-specific IgM, or positive immunohistochemical analysis for hantavirus antigen, or positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results for hantavirus RNA were used to confirm nine of these cases; eight were hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), and one was mild hantavirus disease. The remaining clinical case of hantavirus infection was fatal, and no tissue was available to confirm the diagnosis. During the first 7 months of 1998, five fatal HPS cases caused by a Sin Nombre-like virus were reported from three different regions in the State of São Paulo, Brazil: two in March (Presidente Prudente Region), two in May (Ribeirão Preto Region), and one in July (Itapecerica da Serra Region). Epidemiologic, ecologic, and serologic surveys were conducted among case contacts, area residents, and captured rodents in five locations within the State of São Paulo in June of 1998. Six (4.8%) of 125 case contacts and six (5.2%) of 116 area residents had IgG antibody to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) antigen. No case contacts had a history of HPS-compatible illness, and only one area resident reported a previous acute respiratory illness. A total of 403 rodents were captured during 9 nights of trapping (1969 trap nights). All 27 rodents that were found to be positive for IgG antibody to SNV antigen were captured in crop border and extensively deforested agricultural areas where four of the 1998 HPS case-patients had recently worked. The IgG antibody prevalence data for rodents suggest that Bolomys lasiurus and perhaps Akodon sp. are potential hantavirus reservoirs in this state of Brazil.",M1

Indeed, the responsible agent of HPS, hantavirus, was almost unknown at that moment in the New World, was airborne, seemed to target preferentially young adults, and induced a devastating cardio-pulmonary collapse with a high case-fatality rate (50%), often within hours. It quickly became clear, however, that the same scourge had been known for many years in the Old World under different and mostly milder presentations. With the rapidly increasing knowledge about hantaviruses, it also became clear that they lack many of the potentials of an  ideal  BW weapon, as will be explained in this paper.",M1

HPS is found in North and South America and is often fatal. To test the virulence of ANDV in nonhuman primates, we exposed cynomolgus macaques to Andes virus, either intravenously or by aerosol. The monkeys did not manifest clinical disease but showed significant lymphocyte decreases between days 8 and 11 postexposure. All monkeys developed (1) both IgM and IgG antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid protein and (2) a neutralizing antibody response. By plaque assay, serum samples were negative for infectious virus, but by nonnested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral S-segment genomes were detected in whole blood from 4 of 6 monkeys. This study is the first demonstration of infection of nonhuman primates by an HPS-causing virus.",M1
12404153,"Maporal viral infection in the Syrian golden hamster: a model of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a severe and often fatal rodent-borne zoonosis. Maporal (MAP) virus is a newly discovered hantavirus that originally was isolated from an arboreal rice rat captured in central Venezuela. The results of this study indicate that MAP virus in the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) can cause a disease that is clinically and pathologically remarkably similar to HPS. The similarities include the time course of clinical disease, presence of virus-specific IgG at the onset of clinical disease, subacute pneumonitis, rapid onset of diffuse alveolar edema in the absence of necrosis, hepatic-portal triaditis, mononuclear-cellular infiltrate in lung and liver, widespread distribution of hantaviral antigen in endothelial cells of the microvasculature of lung and other tissues, and variable lethality. These similarities suggest that the MAP virus-hamster system is a useful model for studies of the pathogenesis of HPS and for the evaluation of potential therapeutic agents.",M1
12367756,"Complete nucleotide sequence of a Chilean hantavirus.We have determined the genomic sequence of an Andes virus (ANDV) strain isolated from an infected Oligoryzomys longicaudatus rodent trapped in Chile in 1997. This strain, for which we propose the designation Chile R123, reproduces essential attributes of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) when injected intramuscularly into laboratory hamsters (Hooper et al., Virology 289 (2001) 6-14). The L, M, and S segment sequences of Chile R123 are 6562, 3671, and 1871 nt long, respectively, with an overall G+C content of 38.5%. These respective genome segments could encode a 247 kd RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), 126 kd glycoprotein precursor (GPC), and 48 kd nucleocapsid (N) protein, in line with other Sigmodontine rodent-associated hantaviruses. Among hantaviruses for which complete genomic sequences are available, Chile R123 is most closely related to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) strain NM R11, with greater than 85% amino acid identity between translated L and S segments and 78% amino acid identity between translated M segments. Because Chile R123 shares essentially 100% amino acid identity in regions of overlap with partially sequenced Argentinian and Chilean ANDV strains, Syrian hamster pathogenicity and the potential for interhuman transmission are features likely common to all ANDV strains.",M1
12095430,"First human isolate of Hantavirus (Andes virus) in the Americas.We isolated Andes virus (formal name: Andes virus [ANDV], a species in the genus Hantavirus), from serum of an asymptomatic 10-year-old Chilean boy who died 6 days later of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The serum was obtained 12 days after his grandmother died from HPS and 2 days before he became febrile. No hantavirus immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM antibodies were detected in the serum sample. After three blind passages, ANDV antigens were detected in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and ANDV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A fragment of the virus genome showed 96.2% nucleotide identity with that of prototype ANDV.

HPS was subsequently laboratory confirmed in 30 persons and not confirmed in 105 persons with adequate specimens. Patients with HPS were significantly more likely than were hantavirus-negative patients to report myalgias from onset of symptoms through hospitalization, nausea at outpatient presentation, and diarrhea and nausea at the time of hospitalization; they were significantly less likely to report respiratory symptoms early in the illness. The groups did not differ with regard to time from the onset of illness to the point at which they sought care; time from onset, hospitalization, or enrollment to death was significantly shorter for patients with HPS. At the time of hospitalization, patients with HPS more commonly had myelocytes, metamyelocytes, or promyelocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and significantly more of them had thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, and hypocapnia. Patterns of clinical symptoms, the pace of clinical evolution, and specific clinical laboratory parameters discriminated between these 2 groups.",M1

Approximately 200,000 cases are reported annually, and there is to date no specific treatment available. A major obstacle in studying the medical aspects of HFRS and HPS has been the lack of an adequate animal model. Here we show that infection of cynomolgus macaques by wild-type Puumala hantavirus resulted in typical signs of HFRS including lethargy, anorexia, proteinuria, and/or hematuria, in addition to cytokine (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), C-reactive protein, creatinine, and nitric oxide responses. Viral RNA was detected in plasma from days 3 to 7 postinoculation until days 24 to 28 postinoculation, infectious virus was recovered, and the virus-specific immune responses (immunoglobulin M [IgM], IgG, and neutralizing antibodies) mimicked those seen in humans. The results indicated that the monkey model will provide a valuable tool for studies of pathogenesis, candidate vaccines, and antivirals for hantavirus disease.",M1
11679129,"Seasonal variation in prevalence of antibody to hantaviruses in rodents from southern Argentina.We conducted a small mammal trapping study to investigate temporal variation in prevalence of infection in hantavirus reservoir populations in the Patagonian Andes mountain range, Rio Negro province, Argentina. Rodent blood samples collected in natural and periurban habitats and at the home of an hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) case patient were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Organ tissue samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis. Eight species of 1032 rodents were captured in 15 551 trap nights, giving an overall trap success of 6.6%. Hantavirus antibody was detected in 30 of 555 Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (reservoir of Andes virus), three of 411 Abrothrix longipilis, and one of 10 Loxodontomys micropus. Antibody prevalences in O. longicaudatus were 13.7% in spring 1996, 59.3% in summer 1996, 2.1% in autumn 1997, 12.4% in winter 1997 and 3.1% in spring 1997. A much higher antibody prevalence (33%) was found during trapping around the residence of an HPS case patient. Higher prevalences were found in older male O. longicaudatus. There was no apparent correlation of antibody prevalence with rodent population density, or of rodent population density or antibody prevalence with numbers of human cases. For an HPS case that occurred in our study area in 1997, we identified the probable rodent reservoir and likely site of exposure by matching the genetic sequences of virus obtained from a rodent and the HPS case patient.",M1

To improve our understanding of the epidemiology of HPS in the western United States, we conducted studies of population dynamics and SNV antibody prevalence in deer mouse populations for 6 years on 12 mark-recapture grids in Montana. Monthly numbers of deer mice ranged from zero to over 170 on 1-hectare grids. SNV antibody prevalence was higher than observed in studies in other parts of the United States, averaging 13% (0% to 50%), and peaking in May or June each year. Antibody-positive mice were older (heavier) (78% of positives were adults versus 52% of negatives) and more likely to be males (61% of positives versus 53.4% of negatives). A higher proportion of antibody-positive deer mice of all age-mass classes had scars than did antibody-negative mice. Month-to-month survivorship of antibody-positive adult mice was similar to that of antibody-negative mice, but survival of young antibody-positive deer mice was lower than antibody-negative deer mice. This is the first study to clearly suggest a detrimental effect of SNV infection on deer mice.",M1
11485402,"Genetic identification and characterization of limestone canyon virus, a unique Peromyscus-borne hantavirus.Hantaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, are rodent-borne RNA viruses that can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in various regions of the Americas. A coevolutionary relationship exists between hantaviruses and their specific rodent reservoir hosts; the phylogeny of the viruses generally matches that of the rodents. There are several Peromyscus-borne hantaviruses, including Sin Nombre virus, the most common cause of HPS in North America. This report describes the genetic detection and characterization of a newly discovered Peromyscus boylii-borne virus, Limestone Canyon (LSC) virus, the most divergent member of the Peromyscus-borne hantaviruses to date. Analysis of a 1209-nucleotide region of the S segment of LSC virus showed it to be more closely related to hantaviruses found in harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis and R. mexicanus) than to other Peromyscus-associated hantaviruses (Sin Nombre, New York, and Monongahela). Phylogenetic analysis of virtually the entire M genome segment (3489 nucleotides) of LSC virus revealed a similar picture in which LSC virus was found to be very distinct from other Peromyscus-associated viruses, but its exact relationship to the other Peromyscus-borne and the Reithrodontomys-borne viruses was not resolved. These results indicate that hantavirus host species-jumping events can occur by which a hantavirus may switch to, and become established in, a rodent host belonging to a different genus. P. boylii are present throughout the southwestern United States and central Mexico. More extensive screening of HPS patients by using RT-PCR assays will be necessary to determine if LSC virus can cause human disease.",M1

Although the identity of the virus detected in P. maniculatus in Mexico could not be determined by these serologic results, our findings suggest that SNV may occur throughout the range of P. maniculatus in North America.

As of December 31, 1998, there were 200 confirmed cases from 30 states (43% case-fatality ratio). The national HPS case registry was examined to determine the incubation period of HPS. Review of 11 case-patients with well-defined and isolated exposure to rodents suggests that the incubation period of HPS is 9 to 33 days, with a median of 14-17 days.

11285748,"[Epidemiology of hantaviruses in Baden-Wurttemberg]Hantavirus, originally named after the Hantaan River in Korea, is the aetiologic agent for the Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in the asian region, in the Americas for the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome  (<e>HPS</e>). In Middle Europe hantaviruses are responsible for the  Nephropathia Epidemica  (NE), a mild form of HFRS. Hantaviruses belong to the family of Bunyaviridae. Like other members of this family their genome consists of three segments of single stranded RNA (ss-RNA) leading to various subtypes, strongly associated with different rodent hosts. There are two major groups, the hantaan lineage harbored by murine rodents and the Puumala lineage harbored by arvicolidae ( old world ) and sigmodontidae ( new world ). Infected rodents may develop chronic infections for months or even life-long and may shed infectious virus with urine and feces. The primary mode of infection of man occurs by inhaling contaminated aerosols or soil particles. The collection of epidemiologic data in the state of Baden-Württemberg was realized in three different steps: Collection and localisation of clinical cases (n = 62): A concentration of clinical cases in the middle of the state was found. The examination of the seroprevalence of exposed persons: By the examination of 4000 sera from forest workers, a seroprevalence with an average of 2.1% was found. In the districts of Reutlingen and Tübingen seroprevalences up to 9% were found. This leads to the assumption that there are endemic areas. Epidemiologic studies of reservoir hosts: Serologic surveys of rodents (n = 1150) in the described areas yielded to a seroprevalence up to 10-30%. Virus carriers were determined with RT-PCR and nested-PCR testing. The prevalence in the rodent population showed an average of 10%. The isolated subtypes were all identified as members of the Puumala-lineage. The origin of sporadic infections with Hantavirus of the Hantaan-lineage in Baden-Wuerttemberg is still unknown.",M1
11217408,"Cellular receptors and hantavirus pathogenesis.Hantaviruses cause two potentially lethal diseases, <e>HPS</e> and HFRS, and both diseases result in defects in vascular permeability and platelet function. Human beta 3 integrins confer cellular susceptibility to HPS- and HFRS-causing hantaviruses, a fact directly linking platelets, endothelial cells, and hantavirus diseases to the use of [figure: see text] cellular receptors that maintain capillary integrity and regulate platelet function. The role of vitronectin, PAI-1, uPAR, and complement cascades in hantavirus pathogenesis are unstudied but may contribute to specific disease syndromes effected by hantaviruses. The divergence of hantavirus surface glycoproteins and common beta 3-integrin usage provides further insight into the interaction of hantaviruses with cells. G1 and G2 glycoprotein variation is likely to contribute to additional interactions that determine pathogenic responses to individual viruses. beta 3-integrin usage also suggests that common elements exist on G1 or the more highly conserved G2 surface glycoprotein, which mediate viral attachment to integrins. Although there is currently no data defining the virion attachment protein, the development of antibodies that recognize the hantavirus attachment protein and block integrin interactions is of interest since it is likely to provide an additional point for therapeutic intervention and vaccine development. There are a plethora of effects that could be elicited by hantavirus regulation of cellular beta 3 integrins and their ligands that are consistent with hantavirus diseases. Since beta 3 integrins are critical adhesive receptors on platelets and endothelial cells and regulate both vascular permeability and platelet activation and adhesion, the use of these receptors by hantaviruses is likely to be fundamental to hantavirus pathogenesis. The lack of an animal model for hantavirus pathogenesis has prevented a systematic analysis of immune and cellular responses to hantavirus infections, and it impedes our ability to study protective or therapeutic approaches to hantavirus diseases. However, recent findings suggest that human beta 3 integrins within transgenic mice may provide animal models of hantavirus pathogenesis and have the potential to radically alter the ability to investigate hantavirus disease.",M1
11189727,"Hantavirus infections.Hantaviruses are the causative agents of the zoonotic diseases known as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the Americas. These pathogens are maintained in the wild by rodent reservoirs and are mainly transmitted via the aerosol route. The infection is chronic and apparently asymptomatic in host animals. Whilst HFRS is caused by Hantaan, Seoul, Dobrava and Puumala hantaviruses, HPS is associated with Sin Nombre-like viruses. Common clinical features of HFRS and HPS include fever, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and a capillary leak syndrome associated with shock in most severe cases. Outbreaks of HFRS and HPS are generally observed during years with dense rodent populations resulting from favourable climatic and environmental conditions. Human activities, such as rodent trapping, farming, cleaning rodent-infested areas, construction work, camping and hunting, are also implicated in the occurrence of hantavirus disease. Prophylactic measures in endemic areas rely essentially on information campaigns and rodent control.",M1
10996116,"Evaluation of two commercially available immunoassays for the detection of hantavirus antibodies in serum samples.BACKGROUND: hantaviruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and the spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans may vary from sub-clinical to severe haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Several serotypes have been described from which at least five are pathogenic to humans. Each serotype has a different animal reservoir and geographical distribution. In the acute phase of the disease the clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by serology or by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR). OBJECTIVE: to evaluate two commercially available immunoassays using sera from hantavirus suspected and non-hantavirus patients: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed by MRL Diagnostics, for the detection of immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) against several hantavirus serotypes and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) from Progen, based on slides coated with Hantaan virus (HNTV) and Puumala virus (PUUV), infected cells. STUDY DESIGN: a total of 145 serum samples were used for this study. The serum panel included serum samples from patients suspected of mild (n=91), severe (n=10) HFRS and patients with other viral infections (n=44). RESULTS: the agreement between the MRL EIA and the Progen IFA for the detection of IgM and IgG serum antibodies ranged from 87 to 91%, respectively. In the non-hantavirus group one out of 44 samples was positive by the Progen HNTV IgM IFA, none in the Progen PUUV IFA and two samples in the MRL IgM EIA, resulting in specificities of 98, 100 and 95%, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of the MRL EIAs compared to the Progen overall PUUV and HNTV IFAs were 90 and 91% for IgM, respectively, and 96% for IgG in both immunoassays. CONCLUSIONS: the MRL EIA proved to be relatively sensitive and specific assay for the serological diagnosis of mild and severe HFRS.",M1
10882083,"Hantaviruses.Since the recognition of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the USA in 1993, interest in hantavirus diseases has intensified worldwide. It is clear that hantaviruses have been historically responsible for a variety of human illnesses. Hantaviruses form a separate genus within the Bunyaviridae family. There are currently &gt;20 recognised sero/genotypes and many others are under investigation. Each hantavirus type appears to be specific to a different rodent host. Virus phylogeny very closely reflects rodent phylogeny. The different hantavirus types are associated with different types of disease both in terms of target organs and disease severity. Two major diseases are recognised: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and HPS. HFRS is primarily a disease of the old world while HPS is only recognised in the Americas. Over the past few decades the understanding and recognition of hantavirus disease throughout the world have greatly expanded. The number of recognised virus types continues to grow, as does the spectrum of hantavirus disease. There is evidence of hantavirus causing human disease in the British Isles, but at present it remains a largely uncharacterised disease.",M1
10850356,"Implications of the analogy between recombinant cytokine toxicities and manifestations of hantavirus infections.The etiologic hantavirus of the 1993 emergence of an acute pulmonary failure syndrome in the area around northwestern New Mexico was quickly recognized as related to the Hantaan virus responsible for the outbreak of Korean epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) among UN troops in 1951. Discovery of the new disease which was named the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) and its causative agent the Sine Nombre virus (SNV) inspired detailed comparisons between the two disorders. Major damage to the epithelial cells of the capillaries and arterioles throughout the body leading to extensive capillary leak and subsequent hypotension and shock was the common denominator. The lung capillaries and arterioles were the focus of attack that could lead to rapid pulmonary failure in HPS and the corresponding renal and retroperitoneal vessels that caused a more protracted illness in EHF, but both displayed remarkably similar peripheral blood abnormalities including abnormal mononuclear cells, immature neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration characteristic enough to make blood smear examination a useful tool in early diagnosis. There are evidences that a heavy virus presence in the involved endothelial cells is accompanied by various mononuclear cells capable of generating potent immune response in these areas. Relevant toxic effects of systemically-administered high-dose interleukin-2 for resistant cancers include fever, chills, diarrhea, renal dysfunction, capillary leak syndrome accompanied by hypotension requiring aggressive pressor support, and occasional pleural effusions with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia severe enough to require ventilatory assistance. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in vitro with IL-2 secrete secondary cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). TNF-alpha, implicated in the pathophysiology of septic shock, is capable of inducing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in experimental animals and humans. The strong similarity of these effects to the manifestations noted in the hantavirus diseases justifies the conviction that these and other cytokines involved in potent immune responses would constitute the pathogenic toxic substances predicted by perceptive early investigators of EHF. This concept is favored by clear indications that in both diseases active virus infection disappears the first few days and the ages of involvement correlate with periods of immunocompetence. The paradox of systemic injections of IL-2 that risk hantavirus-type toxicities for treating renal cell carcinoma and melanoma might be avoided by giving potentially more efficacious plant mitogens like PHA as previously reported. The expanded disclosure of a collaborator's method suggesting superior potential for cancer cure involves a unique application of pokeweed mitogen that delivers various cellular and cytokine responses directly to the tumor.",M1

There is evidence to suppose that the infection by Andes virus in suburban areas of Argentina and Chile, whose natural reservoir is Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, has been present but unidentified for a long time. We describe a serologically proven case occurred in 1975. The clinical presentation of the disease slightly differs from that described for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), caused by Sin Nombre virus in the USA. There is a wider range of presentation forms including, besides HPS, mild and asymptomatic cases, a greater proportion of renal involvement and pediatric cases. Therefore the epidemiological scenario would be an endemic disease with fluctuations that follow changes in rodent population and their interactions with humans.",M1

The epidemiology of human diseases caused by these viruses is tied to the ecology of the rodent hosts, and effective control and prevention relies on a through understanding of host ecology. After the 1993 HPS outbreak in the southwestern United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated long-term studies of the temporal dynamics of hantavirus infection in host populations. These studies, which used mark-recapture techniques on 24 trapping webs at nine sites in the southwestern United States, were designed to monitor changes in reservoir population densities and in the prevalence and incidence of infection; quantify environmental factors associated with these changes; and when linked to surveillance databases for HPS, lead to predictive models of human risk to be used in the design and implementation of control and prevention measures for human hantavirus disease.",M1

Humans become infected by inhaling particles of dust contaminated with faeces of rodents, that are found In Europe and Asia hantaviruses named: Hantaan, Seoul and Dobrava-Belgrade causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are prevalent. Typical clinical picture of HFRS consists of renal insufficiency (primarily anuria and then polyuria with disturbances of water and electrolytic balance), hypotension, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrynolisis (DIC). The mild form of this disease caused by Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia. North and South America are the regions where the prevalence of viruses: Sin Nombre, Black Creek Canal, Bayou, and New York causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) has been noted. In the course of this disease non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema requires immediate hospitalisation at intensive care ward with artificial ventilation.

9684629,"Pathogenesis of a North American hantavirus, Black Creek Canal virus, in experimentally infected Sigmodon hispidus.This report describes the first detailed analysis of the replication, persistence, and excretion of a North American hantavirus in its natural rodent reservoir. Black Creek Canal virus was isolated from Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat) shortly after the identification of a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) case occurring in southern Florida. Six-week-old male cotton rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1,000 tissue culture infectious doses. Viral complementary RNA (vcRNA) was quantified as a means of determining the site(s) of viral activity (transcription and replication). In the first few weeks post inoculation (pi), vcRNA was detectable in every tissue examined except blood. The quantities of vcRNA decreased over time, and by five months pi it could be detected only in the brain. In addition to using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) as a means of measuring viral replication/transcription, attempts were made to reisolate virus from all tissue samples taken. Virus could be isolated from every solid tissue examined, and the titers appeared to decrease over time, similar to the QPCR results. However, in contrast to the QPCR results, infectious virus was still routinely detectable at low levels in adrenal gland, liver, kidney, and testicle 150 days pi. Although results of testing for vcRNA in the blood were uniformly negative, infectious virus was detected at one week pi, reached highest titers at two weeks, and decreased dramatically by three weeks. After three weeks pi, infectious virus could only be detected sporadically in blood. Virus was isolated from urine collected during the first 70 days pi and throughout the entire study period in feces and wet bedding. These data indicate that the viral infection can be separated into an acute phase associated with high virus titers, and a chronic or persistent phase associated with lower virus titers and continued shedding of virus in excreta.",M1

To determine if there were changes in the rodent population or the hantavirus seroprevalence in rodents since the HPS outbreak, rodents were trapped at the same sites three years later using the same trapping protocol. The trap success decreased from the numbers trapped during the outbreak, however, the number of Peromyscus, as a percentage of the total rodents captured, did not noticeably decrease. In addition, the seroprevalence of hantavirus antibodies in Peromyscus decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.0001).",M1
9618541,"beta3 Integrins mediate the cellular entry of hantaviruses that cause respiratory failure.Newly emerged hantaviruses replicate primarily in the pulmonary endothelium, cause acute platelet loss, and result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). We now report that specific integrins expressed on platelets and endothelial cells permit the cellular entry of HPS-associated hantaviruses. Infection with HPS-associated hantaviruses, NY-1 and Sin Nombre virus (SNV), is inhibited by antibodies to beta3 integrins and by the beta3-integrin ligand, vitronectin. In contrast, infection with the nonpathogenic (no associated human disease) Prospect Hill virus was inhibited by fibronectin and beta1-specific antibodies but not by beta3-specific antibodies or vitronectin. Transfection with recombinant alphaIIb beta3 or alphav beta3 integrins rendered cells permissive to NY-1 and SNV but not Prospect Hill virus infection, indicating that alphaIIb beta3 and alphav beta3 integrins mediate the entry of NY-1 and SNV hantaviruses. Furthermore, entry is divalent cation independent, not blocked by arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptides and still mediated by, ligand-binding defective, alphaIIb beta3-integrin mutants. Hence, NY-1 and SNV entry is independent of beta3 integrin binding to physiologic ligands. These findings implicate integrins as cellular receptors for hantaviruses and indicate that hantavirus pathogenicity correlates with integrin usage.",M1

9476220,"Small mammal survival and trapability in mark-recapture monitoring programs for hantavirus.Following the 1993 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) epidemic in the south-western United States, mammalogists and epidemiologists instituted long-term studies to monitor population density and prevalence of infection in rodents which constitute the reservoir for Sin Nombre virus (SNV). In this study, field techniques used in sampling small mammals for SNV infection were evaluated to determine if trapping and handling protocols were having significant effects on future trapability or mortality of animals. We compared rodent mark-recapture control plots, on which all rodents were simply measured, marked, and released on site, with experimental plots on which all animals were anesthetized with methoxyflurane, sampled for blood and saliva, measured, marked, and released. Blood samples were obtained from anesthetized animals on the experimental plots via a retro-orbital sinus puncture using a heparinized capillary tube. Dacron tipped oral swabs were used to collect buccal cells and saliva from the rodent's oral cavity. Field data were collected monthly from August 1994 to August 1996 at two sites in New Mexico (USA). Analyses were based on 3,661 captures of 1,513 individuals representing 21 species from three rodent families (Rodentia: Muridae, Heteromyidae, Sciuridae) and two species of rabbits (Lagomorpha: Leporidae). Overall, for most murid rodents (including five Peromyscus spp., Neotoma albigula, and Onychomys leucogaster) and one rabbit species (Sylvilagus floridanus), the handling/bleeding procedures had no significant effects on recapture rates or mortality. In contrast, several species of heteromyids (Dipodomys ordii and Perognathus flavus), one murid (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and one leporid (S. auduboni) suffered higher mortality rates, and heteromyid kangaroo rats (D. ordii and D. merriami) exhibited lower trapability as a result of the anesthesia and sampling procedures. In view of the overall non-significant influence of the sampling procedures on murid rodents, the anesthesia and blood/saliva sampling protocols described herein appear to be appropriate for hantavirus research, and may serve as a model for environmental monitoring of other zoonotic agents and their reservoirs.",M1
9375015,"Laguna Negra virus associated with <e>HPS</e> in western Paraguay and Bolivia.A large outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) recently occurred in the Chaco region of Paraguay. Using PCR approaches, partial virus genome sequences were obtained from 5 human sera, and spleens from 5 Calomys laucha rodents from the outbreak area. Genetic analysis revealed a newly discovered hantavirus, Laguna Negra (LN) virus, to be associated with the HPS outbreak and established a direct genetic link between the virus detected in the HPS cases and in the C. laucha rodents, implicating them as the primary rodent reservoir for LN virus in Paraguay. Virus isolates were obtained from two C. laucha, and represent the first successful isolation of a pathogenic South American hantavirus. Analysis of the prototype LN virus entire S and M and partial L segment nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that this virus is unique among the Sigmodontinae-borne clade of hantaviruses. Analysis of PCR fragments amplified from a serum sample from a Chilean HPS patient, who had recently traveled extensively in Bolivia (where C. laucha are known to occur), revealed an LN virus variant that was approximately 15% different at the nucleotide level and identical at the deduced amino acid level relative to the Paraguayan LN virus. These data suggest that LN virus may cause HPS in several countries in this geographic region.",M1
9278220,"High prevalence of hantavirus infection in a group of Chinese patients with acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology.In southwestern China, small but substantial numbers of patients with acute hepatitis were found without known hepatropic viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C, D or E, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) and were receiving no hepatotoxic drugs. Prevalence of antibodies, both neutralizing and specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG, to Hantaan virus were evaluated in a cohort of 136 such patients: 83 were of unknown aetiology, 53 had known viral hepatitis and 59 healthy subjects acted as controls. The results showed that the incidence of neutralizing antibody to Hantaan virus in acute hepatitis patients with non-hepatitis A-E virus infections (13 of 83) was significantly higher than in those with A-E infections (0 of 53, P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the incidence of specific IgM antibody to Hantaan virus in acute hepatitis patients with non-hepatitis A-E virus infections (6 of 83) was significantly higher than in those with A-E infections (0 of 53, P&lt;0.05) and in healthy subjects (0 of 59, P &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that Hantaan virus may be an important agent, contributing, at least in southwestern China, to a significant number of the cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology.

9255937,"Genetic characterization and phylogeny of Andes virus and variants from Argentina and Chile.Andes virus, one of five hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), emerged in 1995 in southwestern Argentina (López et al. (1996) Virology 220, 223-226). The complete nucleotide sequence of Andes virus S genome segment was determined and compared with sequences of viral RNAs in autopsy tissues of more recently reported HPS cases from southwestern Argentina and south of Chile (cases ESQ H-1/96 and CH H-1/96). Andes virus S segment was found to be 1876 nucleotides in length and to encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), 428 amino acids in length. S segment analysis also revealed a long 5' non-coding region (547 nucleotides) which displays three copies of an octanucleotide sequence repeat. Comparisons of S segment sequences of ESQ H-1/96 and CH H-1/96 (82% of the entire genome sequence) with the corresponding sequences of Andes virus revealed identities of 97.2% and 98.5%, respectively. Sequence motifs identical and in the same positions as exhibited in Andes virus 5' non-coding region were found in both, ESQ H-1/96 and CH H-1/96 sequences. Three genome fragments of the M segment sequence of the viruses (representing approximately 34% of the entire sequence) were also analyzed. Comparisons of S and M segment sequences of Andes virus with the corresponding sequences of ESQ H-1/96 showed S and M segment identities which differ by less than 1.4%. Andes virus and CH H-1/96 have S segments that differ by 1.5% from one another while their M segment fragments differ by 5.5-8.2%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Andes virus along with ESQ H-1/96 and CH H-1/96 form a distinct lineage within the clade containing Bayou and Black Creek Canal viruses. It also showed that Andes virus branch of trees derived from comparisons of S or M sequences differed. It is concluded that Andes virus variants causing HPS circulate east and west of the Andes mountains.",M1
9172092,"Assessment of occupational risk for hantavirus infection in Arizona and New Mexico.Differentiating occupational exposure from other potential domestic or recreational exposure(s) for Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection is an epidemiologic challenge. Interviews on work-related activities were conducted, and serum specimens were obtained from 494 workers in Arizona and New Mexico. These workers may have been exposed to rodents and rodent excreta at work, but their primary occupation did not require rodent contact (National Park Service [n = 193]; Navajo Agricultural Product Industry [n = 65], utility companies [n = 169] and plumbing and heating contractors [n = 67]. Within each occupational group (farm workers [n = 57], laborers [n = 20], professionals [n = 70], repairers [n = 211], service industry workers [n = 83], and technicians [n = 53], the majority of workers reported working in areas that had rodent droppings (range, 75 to 95%); 70% of laborers and 64% of service industry workers reported handling rodents. More than 60% of workers in each group, except technicians, reported reopening and cleaning or working in closed spaces. Approximately 90% of laborers, repairers, and farm workers reported hand-plowing. Although the risk for occupationally related SNV infection appears to be low, workers frequently performed risk activities associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). All workers were seronegative for SNV by enzyme-linked immunoassay or Western blot testing. These findings, the known occupational exposure of some HPS cases, and the high HPS case-fatality rate (52%) support the need for recommendations to reduce human contact with rodents in the workplace. Increased understanding of hantavirus transmission to humans will help focus future recommendations to minimize human exposures effectively.",M1

This illness was caused by a new hantavirus and has been termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The virus is carried by rodents, shed in saliva, urine, and feces. Human infection occurs through inhalation of aerosolized virus.

8995636,"Polarized entry and release in epithelial cells of Black Creek Canal virus, a New World hantavirus.Black Creek Canal (BCC) virus is a newly identified hantavirus from Florida which is carried by the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and is associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). We have investigated the interaction of BCC virus with polarized epithelial cells to examine whether entry and release of this virus occur at specific plasma membrane domains. The polarized Vero C1008 monkey kidney cell line was grown on permeable filters and infected with BCC virus either through the apical or basolateral surface. As shown by indirect immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation analysis, cells infected through the apical surface demonstrated a high level of susceptibility to BCC virus infection. In contrast, Vero C1008 cells infected basolaterally exhibited a barely detectable level of BCC virus-synthesized proteins. Titration of virus from apical and basolateral media of infected cells has demonstrated that virus titers released from the apical surface are about 1,200-fold greater than the titer of virus released into the basolateral media. The site of BCC virus release from polarized cells is, therefore, different from that previously described for release of other members of the family Bunyaviridae and may reflect one of the determinants of hantavirus pathogenesis. In addition, we have shown that BCC viral glycoproteins are expressed at the plasma membrane on the apical surface of polarized cells. Electron microscopy studies of the infected cells revealed evidence of BCC virus budding at the plasma membrane. This strongly indicates that, in contrast to most other members of the Bunyaviridae, BCC virus is assembled at the plasma membrane. Since the same site of virus assembly was recently described for Sin Nombre virus, it is likely that all of the new American hantaviruses associated with HPS utilize this same type of virus maturation.",M1
8982552,"Pulmonary involvement in nephropathia epidemica: radiological findings and their clinical correlations.Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) normally taking a benign clinical course. The etiologic agent, Puumala hantavirus is genetically closely related to Sin Nombre virus, which causes a frequently lethal febrile syndrome with pulmonary involvement (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, <e>HPS</e>). HPS is characterized by acute respiratory distress, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and severe and hypotension, but usually no significant renal involvement. Pulmonary involvement and respiratory symptoms also occur in NE. To understand the mechanisms of pulmonary involvement in NE, we studied the clinical records and chest X-rays of 125 hospital-treated acutely ill NE patients. Twenty-eight percent of the patients had disease-related changes in their chest radiographs. Pleural effusion and atelectasis were the most common X-ray findings, whereas frank pulmonary edema was rare. The patients with pathologic X-ray findings had a more marked hypoproteinemia (lowest measured serum protein concentration 54 +/- 1 g/l) than those with normal X-ray (62.1 +/- 0.9 g/l, p &lt; 0.001) and leukocytosis (highest measured blood leukocyte count 14.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(9)/l vs. 10.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(9)/l, p &lt; 0.001) and more severe renal insufficiency (highest measured serum creatinine 590 +/- 60 mumol/l vs. 356 +/- 29 mumol/l, p &lt; 0.05). Hypoproteinemia best predicted the occurrence of abnormal chest X-ray findings in NE. This suggests, that capillary leakage and inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of NE lung involvement, similarly as in HPS. Differently from HPS, the fluid volume overload associated with renal insufficiency seemed to contribute strongly to the chest X-ray changes in NE.",M1

Human illness associated with hantaviruses is usually the result of exposure to infectious aerosols from saliva or excreta of wild rodents. It is unclear whether or nor certain autopsy and laboratory procedures can also generate similar potentially infectious aerosols. As the biosafety information developed for the HPS agent is limited and the consequences of infection are serious we recommend a cautious approach. Autopsy prosectors should use N-95 particulate respirators as a minimum standard. If aerosols will be generated they should use N-100 particulate respirators or powered air purifying respirators with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Centrifugation and cytocentrifugation of blood or body fluid samples should be performed in bio-contained systems and these specimen containers should be opened in a class II biological safety cabinet.",M1

The classic hantaviral illnesses hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and nephropathia epidemica are indistinguishable from the hantaviral pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in early symptoms and laboratory data, but HPS goes on to produce the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and usually spares the kidney. HPS is the first hantaviral disease reported in humans in the Western Hemisphere and has a tenfold higher mortality than its Eurasian counterparts. The predominant serogroup causing the Four Corners epidemic of the summer of 1993 is the Sin Nombre virus, previously called the Muerto Canyon virus. It is a unique virus but shares some genetic similarity to the nonpathogenic Prospect Hill serogroup, which has been found in North American rodents for decades.

In ultrastructural examinations, we identified hantavirus particles in pulmonary endothelial cells. Morphologically, these mice demonstrate lymphohistocytic infiltrates in hepatic portal zones and slightly increased numbers of immunoblasts in splenic red pulp. Additionally, the alveolar septa in the lungs of infected mice are edematous with hyperplasia of type 1 pneumocytes.

Diagnosis during the prodromal phase is difficult although very limited data suggest that most these patients also have hantavirus IgG and IgM antibodies. Patients with suspected hantavirus infection should be treated in a critical care unit, as sudden hemodynamic deterioration can occur at any time. Hemodynamic monitoring is encouraged in patients with cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs, and inotropic support and vasopressors should be used rather than fluids. An uncontrolled study of ribavirin therapy was inconclusive and a placebo-controlled trial is therefore planned. The latter study aims to enroll persons with prodromal findings and early cardiopulmonary disease.",M1
8734923,"[Retrospective detection of hantavirus clinical infections in Argentina]Hantavirus activity in rodents and human beings in Argentina has been known since the 1980's. In this study, we retrospectively investigated hantavirus infections among Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) cases notified between 1987 and 1994, without virological confirmation. IgG and IgM antibodies to hantavirus were tested by ELISA. Among 1028 patients included in the study, we found 13 recent infections (1.26%) and 13 remote infections (1.26%). IgG antibodies determined in 745 healthy persons living in the same localities of recent infection cases, gave only one positive result (0.13%). Nine of the 13 recent infections had the clinical presentation of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) while the other four were in the form of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). We performed a clinical and epidemiological comparison between the nine patients with FHSR and two paired control groups: one with confirmed AHF and the other with Febrile Syndrome of Undetermined Etiology (FSUE), which were negative for hantavirus, Junin and LCM. There were no differences between clinical signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, normal or high leucocyte counts, with thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, high creatinine levels and proteinuria in HFRS cases resulted useful for differential diagnosis. These results showed the coexistence of Junin virus and hantaviruses in the endemic area of AHF, and indicate the importance of including the infection with these viruses in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fevers and respiratory distress syndromes of unknown etiology. The clinical variability found could be related to the presence of more than one hantavirus serotype in our country.",M1

Hantavirus RNA and antigens were detected in patient autopsy tissues, and nucleotide sequence analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products identified a newly recognized unique hantavirus, provisionally named Bayou virus. Prominent features of the clinical illness are compatible with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), but several features such as renal insufficiency and intraalveolar hemorrhage are more compatible with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease associated with Eurasian hantaviruses.",M1
7771603,"A household-based, case-control study of environmental factors associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States.During an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the southwestern United States, trained environmental assessment teams conducted surveys at 17 case-patient homes and matched controls from June through August 1993. Variables related to rodent abundance were quantified and standardized rodent trapping was conducted around and within households. The majority of households were located in pinon-juniper vegetation zones, and there were no significant differences in the type of house in which cases and controls lived. The only environmental factor that distinguished case households from controls was significantly higher small rodent densities (median trap success for case sites = 17.3%, 12.7% for near controls, and 8.3% for far controls). Frequency of hantaviral infection in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) did not vary significantly among households of cases and controls, with a range of 27.5-32.5% antibody-positive. Indices of rodent fecal contamination were slightly higher in case houses. The data indicate that higher rodent densities were associated with households in which HPS cases occurred. Strategies that control rodent numbers and decrease rodent access to dwellings may reduce risk of human infection.",M1
7887439,"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Pathogenesis of an emerging infectious disease.A recent outbreak of a severe pulmonary disease in the southwestern United States was etiologically linked to a previously unrecognized hantavirus. The virus has been isolated from its major reservoir, the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, and recently named Sin Nombre virus. Clinically, the disease has become known as the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Since May 1993, 44 fatal cases of HPS have been identified through clinicopathological review and immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of tissues from 273 patients who died of an unexplained noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. In 158 cases for which suitable specimens were available, serological testing and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of extracted RNA was also performed. IHC, serological, and PCR results were concordant for virtually all HPS and non-HPS patients when more than one assay was performed. The prodromal illness of HPS is similar to that of many other viral diseases. Consistent hematological features include thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift, and reactive lymphocytes. Pulmonary histopathological features were similar in most of the fatal HPS cases (40/44) and consisted of an interstitial pneumonitis with a variable mononuclear cell infiltrate, edema, and focal hyaline membranes. In four cases, however, pulmonary features were significantly different and included diffuse alveolar damage and variable degrees of severe air space disorganization. IHC analysis showed widespread presence of hantaviral antigens in endothelial cells of the microvasculature, particularly in the lung. Hantaviral antigens were also observed within follicular dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Hantaviral inclusions were observed in endothelial cells of lungs by thinsection electron microscopy, and their identity was verified by immunogold labeling. Virus-like particles were seen in pulmonary endothelial cells and macrophages. HPS is a newly recognized, often fatal disease, with a spectrum of microscopic morphological changes, which may be an important cause of severe and fatal illness presenting as adult respiratory distress syndrome.",M1
7856107,"Isolation and initial characterization of a newfound hantavirus from California.A fatal case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in northern California prompted our attempt to isolate viruses from local rodents. From tissues of two deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, two hantaviruses (Convict Creek virus 107 and 74, CC107 and CC74) were established in cell culture. Viral antigens, proteins, and RNAs of the first and archetypical isolate (CC107) were examined, and portions of the medium (M) and small (S) genome segments of both isolates were sequenced. Antigenically, CC107 virus and the second isolate, CC74 virus, were more closely related to Puumala virus than Hantaan (HTN) virus, though distinct from both. Northern blots of viral RNAs showed the large and M segments of CC107 to be the same size as those of HTN virus, whereas the S segment was larger. Protein gels did not reveal CC107 to have a substantially larger nucleocapsid protein than HTN virus. Partial nucleotide sequence comparisons of CC107 and CC74 viruses revealed their M segments to be highly similar to one another, while their S segments differed by more than 10%. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence comparisons showed the California isolates to be closely related to the newfound hantaviruses first detected in the Four Corners area and since incriminated in HPS through wide areas of the United States.",M1
8561891,"Hantaviruses: clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic aspects.Hantaviruses comprise a genus of the family Bunyaviridae. Bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a negative-sense, tripartite RNA genome. Hantaviruses are etiologic agents for two acute and severe illnesses of man, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Each hantavirus is primarily associated with a single rodent host species or genus, and is transmitted to man through accidental inhalation or ingestion of virus-contaminated rodent excreta. The distribution of hantaviruses is worldwide. HFRS is caused by infection with Hantaan, Seoul, Dobrava/Belgrade, and Puumala hantaviruses, all of which are enzootic in murid rodents of Old World origin. HPS is caused by any of several hantavirus species associated with indigenous New World rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae, family Muridae. HFRS and HPS have numerous common epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics. Common features include fever, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and a profound capillary leak syndrome associated with hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and shock. Worldwide, HPS is much less common than HFRS but is associated with a higher mortality rate. Recovery from hantavirus disease is generally complete, although chronic renal insufficiency may be a rare sequel of HFRS.",M1
7525860,"Dominant glycoprotein epitope of four corners hantavirus is conserved across a wide geographical area.A newly identified hantavirus, tentatively called Four Corners virus (FCV), was found to be the aetiological agent of a 1993 outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in the southwestern United States. Immunodominant epitopes of 43 and 31 amino acids were identified in the nucleocapsid protein and G1 glycoprotein, respectively. The G1 genes of different hantaviruses are highly divergent, suggesting that geographically diverse FCVs might fail to cross-react owing to antigenic drift. We now show that the immunodominant epitope of G1 is conserved among 18 FCVs from a broad geographical area, despite extensive nucleotide sequence heterogeneity. Antibodies from all 45 HPS patients, separated by more than 3000 km were shown to be reactive with the dominant G1 epitope. Evidence for limited cross-reactivity between the G1 antigen of a novel hantavirus of the cotton rat and that of FCV is presented.",M1
19897744,"Altered lung surfactant system in a Rab38-deficient rat model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Several Long-Evans rat substrains carrying the phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding diathesis are a rat model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). The mutation responsible for the phenotype (Ruby) was identified as a point mutation in the initiation codon of Rab38 small GTPase that regulates intracellular vesicle transport. As patients with HPS often develop life-limiting interstitial pneumonia accompanied by abnormal morphology of alveolar type II cells, we investigated lung surfactant system in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats, one strain of the Ruby rats. The lungs showed conspicuous morphology of type II cells containing markedly enlarged lamellar bodies. Surfactant phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein B were increased in lung tissues and lamellar bodies but not in alveolar lumen. Expression levels of mRNA for surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D were not altered. Isolated type II cells showed aberrant secretory pattern of newly synthesized [(3)H]phosphatidylcholine, i.e., decreased basal secretion and remarkably amplified agonist-induced secretion. [(3)H]phosphatidylcholine synthesis and uptake by type II cells were not altered. Thus Rab38-deficient type II cells appear to carry abnormality in lung surfactant secretion but not in synthesis or uptake. These results suggest that aberrant lung surfactant secretion may be involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia in HPS.",M2
19843503,"Clinical and cellular characterisation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 6.BACKGROUND: In the last decade, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) has arisen as an instructive disorder for cell biologists to study the biogenesis of lysosome related organelles (LROs). Of the eight human HPS subtypes, only subtypes 1 through 5 are well described. AIM: To characterise extensively the HPS-6 subtype, caused by defects in HPS6, a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome related organelles complex-2 (BLOC-2). METHODS: Mutation analysis for the HPS6 gene was performed on DNA from our group of unclassified HPS patients. The clinical phenotype of patients with HPS6 mutations was then carefully ascertained, and their cultured dermal melanocytes were employed for cellular immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: Molecular studies showed a variety of mutations in the single exon HPS6 gene, including frame shift, missense, and nonsense mutations as well as a approximately 20 kb deletion spanning the entire HPS6 genomic region. Cellular studies revealed that the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase and tyrosinase related protein 1 failed to be efficiently delivered to the melanosomes of HPS-6 patients, explaining their hypopigmentation. Clinical studies indicated that HPS-6 patients exhibit oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis. Importantly, granulomatous colitis and pulmonary fibrosis, debilitating features present in HPS subtypes 1 and 4, were not detected in our HPS-6 patients. CONCLUSION: The HPS-6 subtype resembles other BLOC-2 defective subtypes (that is, HPS-3 and HPS-5) in its molecular, cellular and clinical findings. These findings are not only important for providing a prognosis to newly diagnosed HPS-6 patients, but also for further elucidation of HPS function in the biogenesis of LROs.",M2
19729668,"Alveolar macrophage dysregulation in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1.RATIONALE: Individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 (<e>HPS</e>-1), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, develop an accelerated form of progressive fibrotic lung disease. The etiology of pulmonary fibrosis associated with HPS-1 is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in HPS-1, lung cells and proteins from individuals with HPS-1 were studied. METHODS: Forty-one subjects with HPS-1 with and without pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated with pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography scan, and bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells and analytes were analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of total bronchoalveolar lavage cells and alveolar macrophages were significantly higher in epithelial lining fluid from subjects with HPS-1 with and without pulmonary fibrosis compared with healthy research volunteers. Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines (i.e., monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in alveolar epithelial lining fluid were significantly higher in subjects with HPS-1 with and without pulmonary fibrosis compared with healthy research volunteers (P &lt; 0.001). In vitro, HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis alveolar macrophages, which did not express HPS1 mRNA, secreted significantly higher concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) protein compared with normal cells (P = 0.001, P = 0.014, and P = 0.011, respectively). Pirfenidone suppressed HPS-1 alveolar macrophage cytokine and chemokine secretion in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: In HPS-1, alveolar inflammation predominantly involves macrophages and is associated with high lung concentrations of cytokines and chemokines. HPS-1 alveolar macrophages provide a model system in which to study the pathogenesis and treatment of HPS pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19523149,"Identifying putative promoter regions of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome genes by means of phylogenetic footprinting.<e>HPS</e> is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and prolonged bleeding. Eight human genes are described resulting in the HPS subtypes 1-8. Certain HPS proteins combine to form Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complexes (BLOCs), thought to function in the formation of intracellular vesicles such as melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and lytic granules. Specifically, BLOC-2 contains the HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6 proteins. We used phylogenetic footprinting to identify conserved regions in the upstream sequences of HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6. These conserved regions were verified to have in vitro transcription activation activity using luciferase reporter assays. Transcription factor binding site analyses of the regions identified 52 putative sites shared by all three genes. When analysis was limited to the conserved footprints, seven binding sites were found shared among all three genes: Pax-5, AIRE, CACD, ZF5, Zic1, E2F and Churchill. The HPS3 conserved upstream region was sequenced in four patients with decreased fibroblast HPS3 RNA levels and only one HPS3 mutation in the coding exons and surrounding exon/intron boundaries; no mutation was found. These findings illustrate the power of phylogenetic footprinting for identifying potential regulatory regions in non-coding sequences and define the first putative promoter elements for any HPS genes.",M2

Of the eight known human subtypes, only HPS-1 and HPS-4 develop pulmonary fibrosis in addition to the general clinical manifestations of oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding diathesis. We identified HPS-1 in three unrelated patients from different regions of India, who presented with iris transillumination, pale fundi, hypopigmentation, nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, and a bleeding diathesis. Two of these patients carried the homozygous mutation c.398+5G&gt;A (IVS5+5G&gt;A) in HPS1, resulting in skipping of exon 5 in HPS1 mRNA. The third patient carried a novel homozygous c.988-1G&gt;T mutation that resulted in in-frame skipping of HPS1 exon 12 and removes 56 amino acids from the HPS1 protein. Given the discovery of HPS-1 in an ethnic group where oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is highly prevalent, it is possible that HPS in India is under-diagnosed. We recommend that unconfirmed OCA patients in this ethic group be considered for mutational screening of known HPS genes, in particular c.398+5G&gt;A and c.980-1G&gt;T, to ensure that patients can be monitored and treated for clinical complications unique to HPS.",M2

The encoded product, Vps33a, is a member of the Sec1 and Class C multi-protein complex that regulates vesicle trafficking to specialized lysosome-related organelles. As Sec1 signaling pathways have been implicated in pre-synaptic function, we examined brain size, cerebellar cell number and the behavioral phenotype of bf mutants. Standardized behavioral tests (SHIRPA protocols) demonstrated significant motor deficits (e.g., grip strength, righting reflex and touch escape) in bf mutants, worsening with age. Histological examination of brain revealed significant Purkinje cell loss that was confirmed with staining for calbindin, a calcium binding protein enriched in Purkinje cells. This pathologic finding was progressive, as older bf mutants (13-14 months) showed a greater attrition of neurons, with their cerebella appearing to be particularly reduced (approximately 30%) in size relative to those of age-matched-control cohorts. These studies suggest that loss of Purkinje neurons is the most obvious neurological atrophy in the bf mutant, a structural change that generates motor coordination deficits and impaired postural phenotypes. It is conceivable therefore that death of cerebellar cells may also be a clinical feature of HPS patients, a pathological event which has not been reported in the literature. In general, the bf mutant may be a potentially new and useful model for understanding Purkinje cell development and function.",M2

It remains uncertain if HPS represents a truly distinct form of granulomatous enterocolitis. We report a series of two patients with HPS treated in Puerto Rico, and the results from medical and surgical intervention for gastrointestinal disease. Our experience with HPS patients has shown the difficult management of perineal disease similar in the management of Crohn's. However, complications from the bleeding diathesis necessitate caution during surgery and potential anesthesia complications. Furthermore, avoidance of a perineal wound is preferred, and when possible, ileostomies have fewer complications than colostomies as they do not involve the small bowel.",M2
18629000,"Murine leukemia virus spreading in mice impaired in the biogenesis of secretory lysosomes and Ca2+-regulated exocytosis.BACKGROUND: Retroviruses have been observed to bud intracellularly into multivesicular bodies (MVB), in addition to the plasma membrane. Release from MVB is thought to occur by Ca(2+)-regulated fusion with the plasma membrane. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address the role of the MVB pathway in replication of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) we took advantage of mouse models for the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) and Griscelli syndrome. In humans, these disorders are characterized by hypopigmentation and immunological alterations that are caused by defects in the biogenesis and trafficking of MVBs and other lysosome related organelles. Neonatal mice for these disease models lacking functional AP-3, Rab27A and BLOC factors were infected with Moloney MLV and the spread of virus into bone marrow, spleen and thymus was monitored. We found a moderate reduction in MLV infection levels in most mutant mice, which differed by less than two-fold compared to wild-type mice. In vitro, MLV release form bone-marrow derived macrophages was slightly enhanced. Finally, we found no evidence for a Ca(2+)-regulated release pathway in vitro. Furthermore, MLV replication was only moderately affected in mice lacking Synaptotagmin VII, a Ca(2+)-sensor regulating lysosome fusion with the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Given that MLV spreading in mice depends on multiple rounds of replication even moderate reduction of virus release at the cellular level would accumulate and lead to a significant effect over time. Thus our in vivo and in vitro data collectively argue against an essential role for a MVB- and secretory lysosome-mediated pathway in the egress of MLV.",M2

Subtle oculocutaneous albinism led to the finding of diminished dense bodies in the platelets under electron microscopy, hence the diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Biopsies from the stomach and duodenum revealed a lymphocytic infiltration in the submucosa, but H pylori infection was absent. The gastroduodenitis responded to the treatment with omeprazole while iron deficiency anemia was corrected by oral iron therapy.

A point mutation in the postulated GTP/GDP-interacting domain of Rab38 has been identified as the genetic lesion responsible for oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in chocolate (cht) mice. Another point mutation that prevents translation of Rab38 mRNA is the molecular basis of the Ruby gene mutation causing the phenotype of OCA and prolonged bleeding time in Fawn-Hooded and Tester-Moriyama rats. Cht mice show conspicuously enlarged lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells and abnormal lung structure. Triton X-114 phase partitioning of cht mouse lung showed that Rab38cht-protein was recovered in the aqueous phase. We produced recombinant Rab38cht-protein using a baculovirus/insect cell-protein expression system.

17933573,"An immunoblotting assay to facilitate the molecular diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) comprises a constellation of human autosomal recessive disorders characterized by albinism and platelet storage pool deficiency. At least eight types of HPS have been defined based on the identity of the mutated gene. These genes encode components of four ubiquitously expressed protein complexes, named Adaptor Protein (AP)-3 and Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex (BLOC)-1 through -3. In patients of Puerto Rican origin, the molecular diagnosis can be based on analysis of two founder mutations. On the other hand, identification of the HPS type in other patients relies on the sequencing of all candidate genes. In this work, we have developed a biochemical assay to minimize the number of candidate genes to be sequenced per patient. The assay consists of immunoblotting analysis of extracts prepared from skin fibroblasts, using antibodies to one subunit per protein complex. The assay allowed us to determine which complex was defective in each of a group of HPS patients with unknown genetic lesions, thus subsequent sequencing was limited to genes encoding the corresponding subunits. Because no mutations within the two genes encoding BLOC-3 subunits could be found in two patients displaying reduced BLOC-3 levels, the possible existence of additional subunits was considered. Through size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis, the native molecular mass of BLOC-3 was estimated to be 140+/-30 kDa, a value most consistent with the idea that BLOC-3 is a HPS1HPS4 heterodimer (approximately 156 kDa) albeit not inconsistent with the putative existence of a relatively small third subunit.",M2

A number of human HPS genes and rodent orthologues have been identified whose protein products are key components of 1 of 4 different protein complexes (AP-3 or BLOC-1, -2, and -3) that are key participants in the process. Drosophila melanogaster has been a key model organism in demonstrating the in vivo significance of many genes involved in protein trafficking pathways; for example, mutations in the  granule group  genes lead to changes in eye colour arising from improper protein trafficking to pigment granules in the developing eye. An examination of the chromosomal positioning of Drosophila HPS gene orthologues suggested that CG9770, the Drosophila HPS5 orthologue, might correspond to the pink locus. Here we confirm this gene assignment, making pink the first eye colour gene in flies to be identified as a BLOC complex gene.",M2

The eight known HPS proteins combine in functional complexes, two of which are called BLOC-2 and BLOC-3; a BLOC is a Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex. Organelles affected in HPS include the melanosome, resulting in hypopigmentation, and the platelet delta (dense) granule, resulting in prolonged bleeding times. Whole mount electron microscopy (EM) detects the absence of platelet delta granules and confirms the diagnosis of HPS. To date, the status of other organelles and granules in HPS platelets has not been documented. We performed ultrastructural studies on platelets of patients with different genetic forms of HPS, specifically those comprising the BLOC-2 and BLOC-3 subtypes. No differences in distribution, size or quantity of other platelet organelles and membrane structures could be detected in our patients. Since alpha and delta granules are formed from multivesicular bodies in the megakaryocyte, and since only delta granules are defective in HPS, we conclude that HPS genes function within the portion of delta granule biogenesis that has diverged from that of alpha granules. Thus, it is unlikely that the generalized bleeding diathesis of HPS is attributed to a deficiency of alpha granules.",M2
17363777,"Susceptibility of Hermansky-Pudlak mice to bleomycin-induced type II cell apoptosis and fibrosis.Pulmonary inflammation, abnormalities in type II cell and macrophage morphology, and pulmonary fibrosis are features of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), a recessive disorder associated with intracellular trafficking defects. We have previously reported that  Pearl  (HPS2) and  Pale Ear  (HPS1) mouse models have pulmonary inflammatory dysregulation and constitutive alveolar macrophage (AM) activation (Young LR et al., J Immunol 2006;176:4361-4368). In the current study, we used these HPS models to investigate mechanisms of lung fibrosis. Unchallenged HPS1 and HPS2 mice have subtle airspace enlargement and foamy AMs, but little or no histologic evidence of lung fibrosis. Seven days after intratracheal bleomycin (0.025 units), HPS1 and HPS2 mice exhibited increased mortality and diffuse pulmonary fibrosis compared to strain-matched C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice. HPS mice had significantly increased collagen deposition, and reduced quasi-static and static compliance consistent with a restrictive defect. The early airway and parenchymal cellular inflammatory responses to bleomycin were similar in HPS2 and WT mice. Greater elevations in levels of TGF-beta and IL-12p40 were produced in the lungs and AMs from bleomycin-challenged HPS mice than in WT mice. TUNEL staining revealed apoptosis of type II cells as early as 5 h after low-dose bleomycin challenge in HPS mice, suggesting that type II cell susceptibility to apoptosis may play a role in the fibrotic response. We conclude that the trafficking abnormalities in HPS promote alveolar apoptosis and pulmonary fibrosis in response to bleomycin challenge.",M2

HPS5 has an unknown function and lacks homology to known proteins. We performed ultrastructural studies of HPS-5 melanocytes revealing predominantly early-stage melanosomes with many small 3,4(OH)2-phenylalanine-positive vesicles throughout the cell body and dendrites. These findings resemble the distinct ultrastructural features of HPS-3 melanocytes; HPS3 is also a BLOC-2 component. Immunofluorescence and immunoEM studies showed decreased TYRP1 labeling in the dendrites of HPS-5 melanocytes, and the overall abundance of TYRP1 was reduced. No substantial differences were observed in the distribution or abundance of Pmel17 in HPS-5 melanocytes. In normal melanocytes, endogenous tyrosinase colocalized with Pmel17 and TYRP1 in the perinuclear area and dendritic tips; this was much reduced in HPS-5 melanocytes, particularly in the tips. We conclude that early stage melanosome formation and Pmel17 trafficking are preserved in HPS5-deficient cells. Tyrosinase and TYRP1 are mistrafficked, however, and fail to be efficiently delivered to melanosomes of HPS-5 melanocytes.",M2

Orthologs of all of these genes in Drosophila melanogaster belong to the 'granule group' of eye pigmentation genes. Other genes associated with HPS encode subunits of three complexes of unknown function, named biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC)-1, -2 and -3, for which the Drosophila counterparts had not been characterized. Here, we report that the gene encoding the Drosophila ortholog of the HPS5 subunit of BLOC-2 is identical to the granule group gene pink (p), which was first studied in 1910 but had not been identified at the molecular level. The phenotype of pink mutants was exacerbated by mutations in AP-3 subunits or in the orthologs of VPS33A and Rab38. These results validate D. melanogaster as a genetic model to study the function of the BLOCs.",M2
17068483,"Hermansky-Pudlak HPS1/pale ear gene regulates epidermal and dermal melanocyte development.The pale ear (ep) mouse strain is a model for the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 (<e>HPS</e>-1), an autosomal recessive disorder causing pigmentary dilution, visual disturbances, bleeding diatheses, pulmonary fibrosis, and granulomatous colitis. The ep mice have a coat color very similar to the black-colored parental strain, C57BL/6. However, the ears and tails of ep mice are significantly hypopigmented compared with the control animals, suggesting that the gene mutation in ep mice reveals a differential regulation of melanocyte function in dorsal back skin melanocytes versus tail or ear skin. In this study, we analyzed the mutant phenotype in detail and determined that in the tail, the defective gene causes delayed onset of interfollicular epidermal melanocyte tyrosinase activity, decreased numbers of melanocytes in the interfollicular epidermis and dermis, and severe immaturity of tail epidermal melanosomes, findings not observed in dorsal back follicular melanocytes. These results highlight differences between follicular and interfollicular melanocyte biology and demonstrate that defects in the ep protein not only affect melanosome biogenesis, but also play a developmental role in determining interfollicular epidermal and dermal melanocyte function. The implications of these findings for the mechanisms governing physiologic variation in human pigmentation and for the pathogenesis of vitiligo are discussed.",M2
17003448,"The Zebrafish fade out mutant: a novel genetic model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.PURPOSE: To characterize retinal morphology and visual system function in the zebrafish mutant fade out (fad) and to establish the mutant as a lower vertebrate model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). METHODS: Retinal morphology of fad larvae was examined between 3 and 9 days postfertilization (dpf) by standard histology, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry examination. Apoptotic cells were visualized by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Visual system function was probed by electroretinography and behavioral assessment by optokinetic response measurements. Blood clotting was evaluated by time to occlusion testing of blood vessels as an arterial thrombosis assay. The chromosomal location of fad was determined by simple sequence-length polymorphism mapping. Genomic fragments of candidate genes were cloned by standard molecular techniques and mapped to the zebrafish genome by radiation hybrid mapping. RESULTS: Mutant fad larvae are hypopigmented and show structural defects in the outer retina. Melanosomes of these larvae in the retinal pigment epithelium are hypopigmented, generally smaller, and progressively reduced in number compared to nonmutant larvae. Progressive microvilli protrusions into the photoreceptor cell layer are not detectable, and photoreceptor outer segments get shorter and are misaligned. Photoreceptors subsequently undergo apoptosis, with a peak of cell death at 6 dpf. Electrical responses of the retina and visual performance are severely reduced. Blood clotting is prolonged in mutant fad larvae. Genomic mapping of fad reveals distinct genomic positions of the mutant gene from known human HPS genes. CONCLUSIONS: The fad mutant shows syndromic defects in pigmentation, outer retinal structure and function, and blood clotting. This syndrome is characteristic of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), making fad a novel genetic model of HPS. The gene does not cosegregate with the known human HPS genes, suggesting a novel molecular cause of HPS.",M2

Complications of the syndrome, such as fatal pulmonary fibrosis, renal failure and cardiomyopathy have been described. Granulomatous colitis has been documented in several families with the HPS. The bowel disease of the HPS is a unique type of inflammatory bowel disease with clinical features suggestive of idiopathic ulcerative colitis (UC) and pathologic features suggestive of Crohn's disease.

16848805,"Granulomatous enterocolitis associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.BACKGROUND: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It consists of a triad of tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism (Ty-pos OCA), bleeding diathesis resulting from platelet dysfunction, and systemic complications associated with accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Many patients are from a small area in northwestern Puerto Rico. HPS has been associated with granulomatous enterocolitis in up to 20% of affected patients. It is not known whether this granulomatous colitis is a part of the syndrome, or represents an independent but associated process, such as Crohn's disease. This colitis can be severe, and has been reported to be poorly responsive to medical therapies including sulfasalazine, mesalamine, steroids, and metronidazole. CASE REPORT: We report a series of four patients with refractory enterocolitis in the setting of HPS who were treated at Mount Sinai Hospital between 1998 and 2005. A trial of infliximab was attempted in all four, and produced a complete response in two. CONCLUSIONS: Many phenotypic and pathologic similarities exist between granulomatous enterocolitis in HPS and Crohn's disease. However, it is unclear whether the granulomatous enterocolitis in HPS is because of ceroid deposition or reflects the coexistence of Crohn's disease and HPS. The occurrence of ileal involvement and perianal fistulization in our cases suggests that in at least some instances, HPS and Crohn's disease are truly associated.",M2
16787394,"Interaction of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome genes in the regulation of lysosome-related organelles.Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disease caused by abnormalities in the synthesis and/or trafficking of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) including melanosomes, lamellar bodies of lung type II cells and platelet dense granules. At least 15 genes cause HPS in mice, with a significant number specifying novel subunits of protein complexes termed BLOCs (Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complexes). To ascertain whether BLOC complexes functionally interact in vivo, mutant mice doubly or triply deficient in protein subunits of the various BLOC complexes and/or the AP-3 adaptor complex were constructed and tested for viability and for abnormalities of melanosomes, lung lamellar bodies and lysosomes. All mutants, including those deficient in all three BLOC complexes, were viable though the breeding efficiencies of multiple mutants involving AP-3 were severely compromised. Interactions of BLOC protein complexes with each other and with AP-3 to affect most LROs were apparent. However, these interactions were tissue and organelle dependent. These studies document novel biological interactions of BLOC and AP-3 complexes in the biosynthesis of LROs and assess the role(s) of HPS protein complexes in general health and physiology in mammals. Double and triple mutant HPS mice provide unique and practical experimental advantages in the study of LROs.",M2

The purpose of this article is to explain in detail the characteristic triad of this syndrome and to propose an adequate approach to perform dental treatment, using appropriate protection recommendations for HPS patients. Recommendations for dental treatment are considered.

This HPS database (HPSD; http://liweilab.genetics.ac.cn/HPSD/) provides integrated, annotatory, and curative data that is distributed in a variety of public databases or predicted by bioinformatics servers for the recently cloned human and mouse HPS genes, as well as for the genes responsible for HPSrelated syndromes, such as ChediakHigashi Syndrome (CHS), Griscelli syndrome (GS), oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B), and ocular albinism (OA). The HPSD is designed by using a unique GeneOriented File (GOF) format. Seven blocks (genomic, transcript, protein, function, mutation, phenotype, and reference) are carefully annotated in each userfriendly GOF entry. The HPSD emphasizes paired human and mouse GOF entries. The genes included in this database (currently 58 in total) are arbitrarily divided into four categories: 1) Human and Mouse HPS, 2) Mouse HPS Only, 3) Putative Mouse or Human HPS, and 4) HPS Related Syndromes. All the mutations in these genes are integrated in the GOFs.

16547274,"Lung-restricted macrophage activation in the pearl mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Pulmonary inflammation, abnormalities in alveolar type II cell and macrophage morphology, and pulmonary fibrosis are features of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). We used the naturally occurring  pearl  HPS2 mouse model to investigate the mechanisms of lung inflammation observed in HPS. Although baseline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts and differentials were similar in pearl and strain-matched wild-type (WT) mice, elevated levels of proinflammatory (MIP1gamma) and counterregulatory (IL-12p40, soluble TNFr1/2) factors, but not TNF-alpha, were detected in BAL from pearl mice. After intranasal LPS challenge, BAL levels of TNF-alpha, MIP1alpha, KC, and MCP-1 were 2- to 3-fold greater in pearl than WT mice. At baseline, cultured pearl alveolar macrophages (AMs) had markedly increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, pearl AMs had exaggerated TNF-alpha responses to TLR4, TLR2, and TLR3 ligands, as well as increased IFN-gamma/LPS-induced NO production. After 24 h in culture, pearl AM LPS responses reverted to WT levels, and pearl AMs were appropriately refractory to continuous LPS exposure. In contrast, cultured pearl peritoneal macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes did not produce TNF-alpha at baseline and had LPS responses which were no different from WT controls. Exposure of WT AMs to heat- and protease-labile components of pearl BAL, but not WT BAL, resulted in robust TNF-alpha secretion. Similar abnormalities were identified in AMs and BAL from another HPS model, pale ear HPS1 mice. We conclude that the lungs of HPS mice exhibit hyperresponsiveness to LPS and constitutive and organ-specific macrophage activation.",M2

HPS is thought to occur as a consequence of disturbed formation or trafficking of intracellular vesicles, most importantly, melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. The latter finding, in particular, contributes much to the morbidity associated with the disease, as ceroid lipofuscin deposits in lysosomes affect many organ systems. This is especially problematic in the lungs where it is often associated with pulmonary fibrosis and premature death. Currently, there are 7 known HPS genes in humans. In the mouse, at least 16 known HPS genes produce HPS-mutant phenotypes. The HPS gene mutation is considered to be one of the most prevalent single-gene disorders in northwest Puerto Rico, home to the largest cohort of known patients. In HPS, interventions addressing the bleeding diathesis and pulmonary fibrosis are often disappointingly ineffectual. Pirfenidone, a novel compound with documented anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antifibrotic effects, appears to hold promise in delaying or preventing fibrosis. To date, there has been one successful lung transplant performed on a patient with HPS. We present a patient with HPS and review the current literature on our understanding of this rare disorder.",M2

Some patients develop a fatal pulmonary fibrosis and others a disabling colitis. This study aimed to document the occurrence of colitis among HPS patients, characterize gastrointestinal tract involvement in HPS, and analyze the distribution of colitis among HPS genotypes. METHODS: Of the 122 HPS patients followed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center between 1993 and 2005, 24 were evaluated by endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints. The histology of gastrointestinal biopsies was retrospectively examined to assess for inflammatory changes, granulomata, and pigmented macrophages. These data were compared with symptoms and HPS genetic subtypes. RESULTS: At colonoscopy, 7 of 23 patients (30%) had endoscopic mucosal abnormalities, including nodularity, erythema, petechiae, or erosions. Six of these 7 patients (86%) had findings of colitis on biopsy. Of the 16 patients with normal-appearing colonic mucosa, 2 patients (12%) had colitis on biopsy. Pigmented macrophages were also observed in the colonic lamina propria in 16 of the 23 patients (70%). Of the 8 patients with confirmed colitis, 7 had the HPS-1 subtype, and 1 had the HPS-4 subtype. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased frequency of colitis in our population of 122 HPS patients (8/122, 7%) and in HPS patients referred specifically for symptom evaluation (8/24, 33%). Colitis was found in patients with HPS-1 and HPS-4 genotypes.",M2

HPS is very common in Puerto Rico (PR), particularly in the northwest part of the island, with a frequency of approximately 1:1,800. Two HPS genes and mutations have been identified in PR, a 16-base pair (bp) duplication in HPS1 and a 3,904-bp deletion in HPS3. In Puerto Ricans with more typical OCA, the most common mutation of the tyrosinase (TYR) (human tyrosinase (OCA1) gene) gene was G47D. We describe screening 229 Puerto Rican OCA patients for these mutations, and for mutations in the OCA2 gene. We found the HPS1 mutation in 42.8% of cases, the HPS3 deletion in 17%, the TYR G47D mutation in 3.0%, and a 2.4-kb deletion of the OCA2 gene in 1.3%. Among Puerto Rican newborns, the frequency of the HPS1 mutation is highest in northwest PR (1:21; 4.8%) and lower in central PR (1:64; 1.6%).

Autozygosity mapping studies were undertaken in a large consanguineous family with HPS. Affected individuals displayed features of incomplete oculocutaneous albinism and platelet dysfunction. Skin biopsy demonstrated abnormal aggregates of melanosomes within basal epidermal keratinocytes. A homozygous germline frameshift mutation in BLOC1S3 (p.Gln150ArgfsX75) was identified in all affected individuals. BLOC1S3 mutations have not been previously described in patients with HPS, but BLOC1S3 encodes a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Mutations in other BLOC-1 subunits have been associated with an HPS phenotype in humans and/or mouse, and a nonsense mutation in the murine orthologue of BLOC1S3 causes the reduced pigmentation (rp) model of HPS. Interestingly, eye pigment formation is reported to be normal in rp, but we found visual defects (nystagmus, iris transilluminancy, foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity, and evidence of optic pathway misrouting) in affected individuals. These findings define a novel form of human HPS (HPS8) and extend genotype-phenotype correlations in HPS.",M2

To date, there are several genetically distinct forms of HPS. Many forms of HPS exhibit aberrant trafficking of melanosome-targeted proteins resulting in incomplete melanosome biogenesis responsible for oculocutaneous albinism observed in patients. In HPS-1, melanosome-targeted proteins are localized to characteristic membranous complexes, which have morphologic similarities to macroautophagosomes. In this report, we evaluated the hypothesis that HPS-1-specific membranous complexes comprise a component of the lysosomal compartment of melanocytes. Using indirect immunofluorescence, an increase in co-localization of misrouted tyrosinase with cathepsin-L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, occurred in HPS-1 melanocytes. In addition, ribophorin II, an integral endoplasmic reticulum protein that is also a component of macroautophagosomes, and LC3, a specific marker of macrophagosomes, demonstrated localization to membranous complexes in HPS-1 melanocytes. At the electron microscopic level, the membranous complexes exhibited acid phosphatase activity and localization of exogenously supplied horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated gold particles, indicating incorporation of lysosomal and endosomal components to membranous complexes, respectively. These results confirm that membranous complexes of HPS-1 melanocytes are macroautophagosomal representatives of the lysosomal compartment.",M2

16102489,"Eye movement abnormalities in hermansky-pudlak syndrome.BACKGROUND: Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a type of oculocutaneous albinism associated with a bleeding diathesis and pulmonary fibrosis. Although it is known that patients with HPS exhibit nystagmus, the nature of these abnormal eye movements has not been studied. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with HPS, diagnosed by platelet morphology and genetic analysis, underwent a systemic evaluation and complete eye examination. Twenty-five had eye movement recordings using magnetic search coil, infrared, or video oculography. RESULTS: All patients had iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia, and variable hypopigmentation in skin and eyes. All had bleeding tendencies, and 2 reported excessive bleeding during strabismus surgery. Nine patients had pulmonary fibrosis. Visual acuities ranged from 20/20- to 20/320. Twenty patients had strabismus despite 6 having strabismus surgery previously. Ocular oscillations consistent with congenital nystagmus (CN) were clinically evident in 24 of 27 patients, and half showed periodic alternating nystagmus. In 3 patients without CN, eye movement recordings revealed minimal end-gaze nystagmus, square-wave jerks, drift during fixation and saccades, and low-gain pursuit. These patients had melanin in the posterior pole and better visual acuities than the others (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with HPS have CN, and many have periodic alternating nystagmus. Some have subtle eye movement abnormalities without clinically evident nystagmus, which can obscure the diagnosis, especially if hypopigmentation is mild. Absence of clinical nystagmus in a child with HPS suggests good vision. Patients with albinism, especially before surgery, should be evaluated for HPS to prevent life-threatening complications.",M2

We report the ultrastructural findings in a melanocytic nevus seen in a 17-y-old Japanese female patient with HPS1 who is a compound heterozygote of HPS1 mutations, including a novel mutation. Electron microscopy of a pinkish papule corresponding to the melanocytic nevus revealed markedly aberrant, immature melanosomes, large membranous structures, and giant melanosomes in the vicinity of trans-Golgi network, the characteristic abnormalities because of protein trafficking defects in HPS1. These ultrastructural features were far more clearly demonstrated in the nevus cells than in the epidermal melanocytes.

HPS is associated with biosynthesis defects of melanosomes, platelet-dense bodies, and lysosomes. There are seven genetic HPS subtypes; HPS-1 is the most common. We used a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to investigate six HPS-1 patients, previously assigned as having homozygous mutations in the HPS1 gene. HPS1 gene copy numbers, calculated by use of a comparative Ct method, revealed that one patient was in fact hemizygous for her c.1189delC (S396delC) HPS1 mutation. The causative deletion/insertion was 13,966 bp in size, with defined breakpoints, and involved an adjacent gene (C10orf33). A mechanism of formation is proposed for the deletion/insertion, and both multiplex and qPCR indicated that the deletion/insertion was present in the patient, her brother, and her father. qPCR amplification is valuable for detecting deletions too small to be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This demonstration of hemizygosity, performed using genomic DNA, can eliminate concerns about non-paternity and can verify the diagnosis of an autosomal recessive disorder when a DNA alteration appears to be homozygous by standard PCR and sequencing methods, and its pathogenicity is in doubt.",M2

15838104,"Insights into the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles from the study of the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are a family of cell-type-specific organelles that include melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and cytotoxic T cell granules. The name, LRO, recognizes the fact that all of these organelles contain subsets of lysosomal proteins in addition to cell-type-specific proteins. The recent identification of genetic disorders that cause combined defects in several of these organelles indicates that they share common biogenetic pathways. Studies of one of these disorders, the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), have provided helpful insights into the molecular machinery involved in LRO biogenesis. HPS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in any of 7 genes in humans and 15 genes in mice. These genes encode subunits of 4 multi-protein complexes named AP-3, BLOC-1, BLOC-2 and BLOC-3, in addition to miscellaneous components of the general protein trafficking machinery. The AP-3 complex is a coat protein involved in vesicle formation and cargo selection in the endosomal-lysosomal system. One of these cargo molecules is the melanosomal enzyme, tyrosinase, the missorting of which may explain the defective melanosomes in AP-3-deficient humans and mice. The function of the BLOC complexes is unknown, although they are thought to mediate either vesicle tethering/fusion or cytoplasmic dispersal of LROs. Further studies of these complexes should contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms of LRO biogenesis and the pathogenesis of HPS.",M2
15790974,"Defective surfactant secretion in a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) in humans represents a family of disorders of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis associated with severe, progressive pulmonary disease. Human case reports and a mouse model of HPS, the pale ear/pearl mouse (ep/pe), exhibit giant lamellar bodies (GLB) in type II alveolar epithelial cells. We examined surfactant proteins and phospholipid from ep/pe mice to elucidate the process of GLB formation. The 2.8-fold enrichment of tissue phospholipids in ep/pe mice resulted from accumulation from birth through adulthood. Tissue surfactant protein (SP)-B and -C were increased in adult ep/pe mice compared with wild-type mice (WT), whereas SP-A and -D were not different. Large aggregate surfactant (LA) from adult ep/pe mice had decreased phospholipid, SP-B, and SP-C, with no differences in SP-A and -D compared with WT. Although LA from ep/pe animals exhibited an increased total protein-to-total phospholipid ratio compared with WT, surface tension was not compromised. Phospholipid secretion from isolated type II cells showed that basal and stimulated secretion from ep/pe cells were approximately 50% of WT cells. Together, our data indicate that GLB formation is not associated with abnormal trafficking or recycling of surfactant material. Instead, impaired secretion is an important component of GLB formation in ep/pe mice.",M2
15743322,"Lung pathology of pale ear mouse (model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 1) and beige mouse (model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome): severity of giant lamellar body degeneration of type II pneumocytes correlates with interstitial inflammation.The authors have recently reported the presence of characteristic foamy swelling/degeneration (giant lamellar body degeneration, GLBD) of type II pneumocytes in the lungs affected by Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>)-associated interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP), and proposed the hypothesis that GLBD may be the triggering factor in the development of HPSIP (Virchows Arch 2000; 437: 304-13). The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the lung pathology of pale ear (ep) mouse, a mouse model of HPS1, and of beige (bg) mouse, a mouse model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) with a reference to GLBD and associated pathologic changes. GLBD was found in both ep and bg mice soon after birth, and increased in severity as the mice grew older. Younger mice had only GLBD with no evidence of interstitial change. Aged bg mice showed the most prominent GLBD and patchy areas of alveolar collapse accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration and slight fibrosis. Aged ep mice with less severe GLBD than bg mice of comparable ages also had a slight tendency to develop interstitial inflammation but no fibrosis. The pneumocytes with GLBD were immunoreactive for surfactant protein B and composed of giant lamellar bodies ultrastructurally, findings which were almost identical to those of human GLBD. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that GLBD may play an important role in the development of HPSIP. Ep and bg mice, especially the latter, may be useful mouse models of HPSIP.",M2
15702992,"Normal lytic granule secretion by cytotoxic T lymphocytes deficient in BLOC-1, -2 and -3 and myosins Va, VIIa and XV.Melanocytes and cells of the immune system share an unusual secretory mechanism which uses the lysosome as a regulated secretory organelle. Recently, a number of the proteins required for these 'secretory lysosomes' to undergo exocytosis have been identified. These include Rab27a, Lyst, Rab geranyl geranyl transferase and the adapter protein complex AP-3. Patients lacking any of these proteins are characterized by the rare combination of albinism and immunodeficiency, revealing roles for these proteins in both melanocyte and immune cell secretion. In order to ask how far the link between albinism and immunodeficiency extends we have examined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) secretion from two BLOC-3-deficient patients and seven different mouse models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, all of which display defects in pigmentation and platelet function. We find that CTL function is normal in <e>HPS</e> patients and pale-ear mice deficient in BLOC-3, pallid, muted and sandy mice deficient in BLOC-1, ruby-eye mice deficient in BLOC-2 and buff mice deficient in Vps33a. Similarly, the unconventional myosins, Va, VIIa and XV, which can act as effectors for Rab27a in some cell types, are not required in CTL. These results reveal differences in the protein machinery required for biogenesis and/or secretion of lysosome-related organelles in CTL and melanocytes.",M2
15675963,"Melanocytes derived from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome types 1, 2, and 3 have distinct defects in cargo trafficking.Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder in which mutations in one of several genes interrupts biogenesis of melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and lysosomes. Affected patients have oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, and sometimes develop granulomatous colitis or pulmonary fibrosis. In order to assess the role of HPS genes in melanosome biogenesis, melanocytes cultured from patients with HPS subtypes 1, 2, or 3 were assessed for the localization of various melanocyte proteins. Tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and Dct/Tyrp2 were atypically and distinctly expressed in HPS-1 and HPS-3 melanocytes, whereas only tyrosinase showed an atypical distribution in HPS-2 melanocytes. The HPS1 and AP3B1 (i.e., HPS-2) gene products showed no expression in HPS-1 and HPS-2 melanocytes, respectively, whereas HPS-3 melanocytes exhibited normal expression for both proteins. In normal human melanocytes, the HPS1 protein was expressed as an approximately 80 kDa molecule with both granular and reticular intracellular profiles. In HPS-1, lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), and LAMP3 were localized to abnormal large granules; in HPS-2, all LAMPs exhibited a normal granular expression; and in HPS-3, LAMP1, and LAMP3 exhibited a distinct less granular and more floccular pattern. In contrast, the expressions of Rab 27, transferrin, and cKit were unaffected in all three HPS genotypes. These data demonstrate that the three initially identified subtypes of human HPS exhibit distinct defects in the trafficking of various melanocyte-specific proteins.",M2
15632015,"Melanocyte-specific proteins are aberrantly trafficked in melanocytes of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-type 3.Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome-type 3 (<e>HPS</e>-3) is a relatively mild subtype of HPS with minimal cutaneous and ocular depigmentation. The HPS-3 gene encodes a novel protein of unknown function with a predicted molecular weight of 114 kd. To assess the role of the HPS3 protein in melanization, cultured melanocytes developed from HPS-3 patients were evaluated biochemically and histologically for activity and localization of melanocyte-specific proteins. Endogenous tyrosinase activity of HPS-3 melanocytes was substantial, but tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis was suppressed in intact melanocytes. However, the level of suppression, as well as extent to which up-regulation by isobutylmethylxanthine and cholera toxin was muted, was less that in HPS-1 melanocytes. Ultrastructurally, HPS-3 melanocytes contained morphologically normal melanosomes, predominantly of stage I and II with minimal stage III and few stage IV melanosomes. Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) histochemistry demonstrated an increase in melanization of melanosomes. Unique to HPS-3 melanocytes were numerous DOPA-positive 50-nm vesicles and tubular elements present throughout the cell body and dendrites. Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Tyrp1), dopachrome tautomerase (Dct), and LAMP1 and 3 localization in HPS-3 melanocytes, as evaluated by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, demonstrated a fine, floccular distribution in contrast to the coarse, granular distribution characteristic of control melanocytes. The localization profile of other proteins expressed by melanocytes (ie, Silver/Pmel17, Melan-A/MART-1, LAMP2, Rab 27, transferrin, c-kit, adaptin-3, and the HPS1 protein) appeared normal. These results suggest that a specific subset of melanocyte proteins are aberrantly trafficked throughout the HPS-3 melanocyte and may be responsible for the reduction in melanin synthesis.",M2
15580910,"Color vision in patients with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.PURPOSE: To study color vision in patients with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) METHODS: We evaluated color vision in 42 patients with OCA using the HRR color plates. Sixty seven percent of the patients had the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), diagnosed genetically or clinically. The remaining patients had unknown mutations leading to OCA. RESULTS: 47.6 % of patients of OCA of all types included had a color vision defect. Of these, 55% were female and 45% were male patients. 50% of patients with the HPS (all types) had a color vision deficit. 42.9% of patients with OCA of unknown type had color weakness. 57.1% had normal color vision. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that many patients with OCA and the HPS have a mild red-green color perception deficiency that is not a sex linked trait. The prevalence of color vision deficits in our study population increased with decreasing visual acuity.",M2

His chest roentgenogram on admission showed reticulo-nodular infiltrates and cystic changes throughout both lung fields, and 7 cm mass in the left middle field.

15368543,"Poor response to desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) in children with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.BACKGROUND: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a common genetic disorder in Puerto Rico. In children with HPS, bleeding is the most disturbing and incapacitating problem. Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, (DDAVP)) has been recommended in the management of bleeding disorders characterized by platelet dysfunction, such as HPS. METHODS: Nineteen pediatric Puerto Rican patients with HPS and prolonged bleeding time (BT) were tested for response to administration of DDAVP. RESULTS: Baseline BT was abnormal in 18 (95%) of the patients. The BT following DDAVP administration improved in two cases (11%): one from 7.2 to 5.6 min and the other from 8 to 6 min (Tables II and III). BT measurements remained very prolonged (&gt;15 min) in 17 (89%) of the patients. Patients with the HPS 1 gene mutation had a statistically significant correlation with the poor response following DDAVP (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: DDAVP seldom improves the BT of Puerto Rican children with HPS. Response to DDAVP should be determined individually and platelet transfusion should remain the treatment of choice for a major bleeding episode or surgical procedure.",M2

Seven genes are now associated with HPS in humans. An accurate diagnosis of each HPS subtype has important prognostic and treatment implications. Here we describe the cellular, molecular, and clinical aspects of the recently identified HPS-5 subtype. We first analyzed the genomic organization and the RNA expression pattern of HPS5, located on chromosome 11p14, and demonstrated tissue-specific expression of at least three alternatively spliced HPS5 mRNA transcripts, coding for HPS5A and HPS5B proteins, that differ at their 5'-ends. Genetic screening of 15 unassigned HPS patients yielded six new HPS5 mutations in four patients. Clinically, our HPS-5 patients exhibited iris transillumination, variable hair and skin pigmentation, and absent platelet dense bodies, but not pulmonary fibrosis or granulomatous colitis. In two patients with homozygous missense mutations, hemizygosity was ruled out by gene-dosage multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemical analyses of their fibroblasts supported the HPS-5 diagnosis. Specifically, LAMP-3 distribution was restricted to the perinuclear region in HPS-5 fibroblasts, in contrast to the normal LAMP-3 distribution, which extended to the periphery. This specific intracellular vesicle distribution in fibroblasts, in combination with the clinical features, will improve the characterization of the HPS-5 subtype.",M2

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a series of patients. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients with HPS-1 and 14 patients with HPS-3 were studied. METHODS: Complete eye examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and photographs and photographic grading of iris transillumination and macular transparency using a previously established grading system. RESULTS: Snellen visual acuity was 20/160-2 in the HPS-1 group and 20/125+2 in the HPS-3 group (P = 0.017). Iris grading was statistically significant for less translucence in the HPS-3 patients. The HPS-3 patients also tended to have less transparent maculas, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPS-3 have less severe ophthalmic manifestations than patients with HPS-1. Ophthalmologists treating patients with albinism should consider HPS in their differential diagnosis even in the case of mild iris and macular hypopigmentation.",M2
15265785,"Reduced pigmentation (rp), a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, encodes a novel component of the BLOC-1 complex.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), a disorder of organelle biogenesis, affects lysosomes, melanosomes, and platelet dense bodies. Seven genes cause HPS in humans (HPS1-HPS7) and at least 15 nonallelic mutations cause HPS in mice. Where their function is known, the HPS proteins participate in protein trafficking and vesicle docking/fusion events during organelle biogenesis. HPS-associated genes participate in at least 4 distinct protein complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3; biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), consisting of 4 HPS proteins (pallidin, muted, cappuccino, HPS7/sandy); BLOC-2, consisting of HPS6/ruby-eye, HPS5/ruby-eye-2, and HPS3/cocoa; and BLOC-3, consisting of HPS1/pale ear and HPS4/light ear. Here, we report the cloning of the mouse HPS mutation reduced pigmentation (rp). We show that the wild-type rp gene encodes a novel, widely expressed 195-amino acid protein that shares 87% amino acid identity with its human orthologue and localizes to punctate cytoplasmic structures. Further, we show that phosphorylated RP is part of the BLOC-1 complex. In mutant rp/rp mice, a premature stop codon truncates the protein after 79 amino acids. Defects in all the 5 known components of BLOC-1, including RP, cause severe HPS in mice, suggesting that the subunits are nonredundant and that BLOC-1 plays a key role in organelle biogenesis.",M2

Five HPS genes encode known vesicle trafficking proteins. Nine genes are novel, are found only in higher eukaryotes and encode members of three protein complexes termed BLOCs (Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complexes). Mutations in murine HPS genes, which encode protein co-members of BLOCs, produce essentially identical phenotypes. In addition to their well-known effects on pigmentation, platelet function and lysosome secretion, HPS genes control a wide range of physiological processes including immune recognition, neuronal functions and lung surfactant trafficking. Studies of the molecular functions of HPS proteins will reveal important details of vesicle trafficking and may lead to therapies for HPS.",M2

Seven different HPS genes are known in humans; in mouse, at least 16 loci are associated with HPS-like mutant phenotypes. In the rat, only two HPS models are known, Fawn-hooded (FH) and Tester Moriyama (TM), non-complementing strains in which HPS-like hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency result from a mutation of the Ruby (red eyed dilution; R) locus on Chromosome (Chr) 1. We have identified the R locus as the Rab38 gene, establishing that rat R is homologous to mouse chocolate ( cht). Further, we show that FH and TM rats have identical Rab38 Met1Ile mutations, occurring on an identical Chr 1 marker allele haplotype, indicating that these two strains derive from a common ancestor. This ancestor appears to have been a sub-strain of the outbred Long Evans (LE) strain, and several modern LE sub-strains carry the Rab38 Met1Ile R mutation on the same Chr 1 marker haplotype. These findings have significant implications for the many past and ongoing studies that involve the FH and LE-derivative rat strains. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS; MIM 203300) is a group of autosomal recessive diseases in which oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), progressive and fatal pulmonary fibrosis, and bleeding diathesis due to platelet storage pool deficiency result from defects in the biogenesis of specific cytoplasmic organelles and granules: melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules.

Six human genes HPS1, ADB3A, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, and HPS6 have been identified as cause of the six known subtypes of HPS. While there exist nearly 500 Puerto Rican and non-Puerto Rican HPS-1 patients, very few HPS-4 patients have been reported, and most of these have not been described in detail. We now delineate the clinical characteristics of an HPS-4 patient homozygous for a novel HPS-4 mutation, P685delC.

The complex is known to contain the coiled-coil-forming proteins, Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin. The genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.",M2

Pale ear (ep) mouse is known to have the HPS1 gene mutation, which is seen in patients with HPS and pulmonary fibrosis. As pulmonary fibrosis is not spontaneously observed in ep mice, we hypothesized that external stimuli are necessary for the genetic predisposition of its development. We used silica as the external stimulus to induce the alveolar macrophage-mediated inflammatory response and evaluated the pathological changes of the lung and biochemical analysis of collagenolytic lysosomal enzymes cathepsins L and B in ep mice. Treatment with silica induced the following: persistent accumulation of activated macrophages; delayed clearance of silica from alveolar spaces; and increased collagen fibers in alveolar tissues, which were shown with trichrome staining in ep mice. The comparison of bronchoalveolar lavage cells between the naïve ep and control mice revealed: decreased enzymatic activities but increased antigenic levels of cathepsins L and B, resulting in significantly lower ratios of activity to antigen; increased ceroid deposits and cathepsin L antigens in lysosomes; and no abnormal forms of cathepsins were detected. After silica instillation, activities of cathepsin L in the ep mice increased but ratios of activity to antigen were still significantly low. These phenomena induced by silica suggest that external stimuli bring forth fibrogenesis in the animal models or humans that have HPS1 gene mutation.",M2

Here, we report the biochemical characterization of a stable protein complex named Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-2 (BLOC-2), which contains the HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6 proteins as subunits. The endogenous HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6 proteins from human HeLa cells coimmunoprecipitated with each other from crude extracts as well as from fractions resulting from size-exclusion chromatography and density gradient centrifugation. The native molecular mass of BLOC-2 was estimated to be 340 +/- 64 kDa. As inferred from the biochemical properties of the HPS6 subunit, BLOC-2 exists in a soluble pool and associates to membranes as a peripheral membrane protein.

In the last several years the genetic defects underlying some of these syndromes have been described. HPS is related to 7 genes in humans. GS is related to 3 genes: MYOVA, Rab-27A, and melanophilin (Mlph). CHS is related to one gene: LYST. The genetic defects in ES and CMBS are yet to be defined. Syndromic forms of albinism are associated with defects in the packaging of melanin and other cellular proteins.

Individuals with HPS type 2 (HPS2) lack the cytosolic adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) involved in lysosomal sorting, and are also immunodeficient. Here we characterize an HPS2 mutation and demonstrate that AP-3 deficiency leads to a loss of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity. Although the lysosomal protein CD63 was mislocalized to the plasma membrane, perforin and granzymes were correctly localized to the lytic granules in AP-3-deficient CTLs. However, the lytic granules of AP-3-deficient CTLs were enlarged and were unable to move along microtubules and dock within the secretory domain of the immunological synapse. These data show that AP-3 is essential for polarized secretion from CTLs.",M2

In humans, mutations associated with this syndrome have been identified that affect four genes, most of them located in the HPS-1 gene. We evaluated the clinical, molecular, platelet ultrastructure and platelet function data obtained from one Spanish HPS patient and his relatives. The proband was compound heterozygous for a de novo nonsense mutation (Arg-131Stop), which has not been described previously, and for a common frameshift mutation (insC974). These two mutations were also identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in half the RNA, supporting the premise that they have minor effects on either transcription or RNA stability. The patient had an almost complete absence of platelet-dense granules. Accordingly, his platelets showed a small aggregatory response, reduced CD63 surface expression after platelet activation and minor serotonin uptake. Interestingly, despite the absence of clinical symptoms, two relatives carrying only one HPS-1 mutation (insC974) presented a decreased content of platelet-dense granules and showed significant reductions in platelet aggregation, expression of CD63 after platelet activation and serotonin uptake. Data show that the presence of a single mutation affecting one allele of the HPS-1 gene might have relevance in the organogenesis of platelet-dense granules, affecting platelet function. However, these functional defects were not of a great enough magnitude to have clinical significance and, thus, these subjects were clinically asymptomatic.",M2

In mice, at least 16 loci are associated with HPS, including sandy (sdy; ref. 7). Here we show that the sdy mutant mouse expresses no dysbindin protein owing to a deletion in the gene Dtnbp1 (encoding dysbindin) and that mutation of the human ortholog DTNBP1 causes a novel form of HPS called HPS-7. Dysbindin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to alpha- and beta-dystrobrevins, components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. We also show that dysbindin is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1; refs. 9-11), which regulates trafficking to lysosome-related organelles and includes the proteins pallidin, muted and cappuccino, which are associated with HPS in mice. These findings show that BLOC-1 is important in producing the HPS phenotype in humans, indicate that dysbindin has a role in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and identify unexpected interactions between components of DPC and BLOC-1.",M2

Several HPS genes encode proteins of unknown function including HPS1, HPS3, and HPS4. Here we have identified and characterized endogenous HPS3 and HPS4 proteins from HeLa cells. Both proteins were found in soluble and membrane-associated forms. Sedimentation-velocity and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HPS4 but not HPS3 associates with HPS1 in a complex, which we term biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 3 (BLOC-3). Mutant fibroblasts deficient in either HPS1 or HPS4 displayed abnormal localization of lysosomes and late endosomes, which were less concentrated at the juxtanuclear region in mutant cells than in control fibroblasts. The coat-color phenotype of young homozygous double-mutant mice deficient in subunits of BLOC-3 (HPS1) and BLOC-1 (pallidin) was indistinguishable from that of BLOC-1 single mutants. Taken together, these observations suggest that HPS1 and HPS4 are components of a protein complex that regulates the intracellular localization of lysosomes and late endosomes and may function in a BLOC-1-dependent pathway for melanosome biogenesis.",M2

The aim of this article is to discuss, on the basis of a review of relevant literature, a new familial HPS clinical variant observed in 2 young sisters (aged 16 and 23 years old, respectively), characterized by the typical symptoms of this syndrome. Our patients also suffered from diffuse interstitial pulmonary disease and an unexpectedly increased platelet aggregation and were prone to bacterial infections. Interestingly, we observed urinary tract abnormality in the younger HPS sister and a porencephalic cyst in the older HPS sister; both of these developmental defects have been reported in the Cross syndrome (or oculocerebral hypopigmentation syndrome). It seems that in our patients, an overlapping of the phenotypic manifestations of different rare syndromes may be present. The presence of ceroid-like autofluorescent material in urinary sediment together with the histologic aspects and the autofluorescence of oral mucosa biopsy are consistent with a ceroid-like lipofuscin storage. HPS should be carefully tested for in suspected cases to prevent the severe visual impairment, rapidly progressive pulmonary fibrosis, and other complications associated with this disorder.",M2
12777251,"Aberrant lung structure, composition, and function in a murine model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited disease causing hypopigmentation and prolonged bleeding times. An additional serious clinical problem of HPS is the development of lung pathology, which may lead to severe lung disease and premature death. No cure for the disease exists, and previously, no animal model for the HPS lung abnormalities has been reported. A mouse model of HPS, which is homozygously recessive for both the Hps1 (pale ear) and Hps2 (pearl) genes, exhibits striking abnormalities of lung type II cells. Type II cells and lamellar bodies of this mutant are greatly enlarged, and the lamellar bodies are engorged with surfactant. Mutant lungs accumulate excessive autofluorescent pigment. The air spaces of mutant lungs contain age-related elevations of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. In vivo measurement of lung hysteresivity demonstrated aberrant lung function in mutant mice. All these features are similar to the lung pathology described in HPS patients. Morphometry of mutant lungs indicates a significant emphysema. These mutant mice provide a model to further investigate the lung pathology and therapy of HPS. We hypothesize that abnormal type II cell lamellar body structure/function may predict future lung pathology in HPS.",M2
12756248,"BLOC-3, a protein complex containing the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome gene products HPS1 and HPS4.The Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a genetic disorder characterized by defective lysosome-related organelles. HPS results from mutations in either one of six human genes named HPS1 to HPS6, most of which encode proteins of unknown function. Here we report that the human HPS1 and HPS4 proteins are part of a complex named BLOC-3 (for biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 3). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assemble with each other in vivo. The HPS1.HPS4 complex is predominantly cytosolic, with a small amount being peripherally associated with membranes. Size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analyses of the cytosolic fraction indicate that HPS1 and HPS4 form a moderately asymmetric protein complex with a molecular mass of approximately 175 kDa. HPS4-deficient fibroblasts from light ear mice display normal distribution and trafficking of the lysosomal membrane protein, Lamp-2, in contrast to fibroblasts from AP-3-deficient pearl mice (HPS2), which exhibit increased trafficking of this lysosomal protein via the plasma membrane. Similarly, light ear fibroblasts display an apparently normal accumulation of Zn2+ in intracellular vesicles, unlike pearl fibroblasts, which exhibit a decreased intracellular Zn2+ storage. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins are components of a cytosolic complex that is involved in the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles by a mechanism distinct from that operated by AP-3 complex.",M2
12664304,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 4 (<e>HPS</e>-4): clinical and molecular characteristics.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding attributable to storage-pool-deficient platelets. Although at least 14 mouse models of HPS exist, the human disorders that comprise HPS, i.e., HPS-1, HPS-2, HPS-3, and HPS-4, are recognized to result from mutations in four genes, viz., HPS1, ADTB3A, HPS3, and HPS4, respectively. To characterize further the recently identified HPS-4 disease on molecular and clinical grounds, we first identified the genomic organization of HPS4, located on chromosome 22q11.2-q12.2, including its intron/exon boundaries. We found that HPS4 produces at least two alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts that differ at their 5'-ends. Next, we performed an extensive analysis of 22 unassigned HPS patients (i.e., not having HPS-1, HPS-2, or HPS-3 disease). Using single-strand conformation polymorphism, we determined that seven of the 22 patients had HPS-4. In these seven individuals, we identified five different HPS4 mutations, including one frameshift insertion, one missense, and three nonsense mutations. Three alleles in two patients contained the previously reported Q698insAAGCA frameshift. Three HPS4 mutations were newly described. Four alleles in three patients contained R217X, and two siblings were compound heterozygotes for E138X and E222X. Clinically, our HPS-4 patients exhibited iris transillumination, variable hair and skin pigmentation, absent platelet dense bodies, and occasional pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis, a severe phenotype similar to that of patients with HPS-1.",M2
12647238,"Genetic and phenotypic analysis of the mouse mutant mh2J, an Ap3d allele caused by IAP element insertion.Mocha (mh), a mouse model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), is characterized by platelet storage pool deficiency, pigment dilution, and deafness as well as neurological abnormalities. The trans-Golgi/endosome adaptor-related complex AP-3 is missing in mh mice owing to a deletion in the gene encoding the delta subunit. Mice mutant for a second allele, mh(2J), are as hyperactive as mh, and display both spike wave absence and generalized tonic clonic seizures, but have less coat color dilution, no hearing loss, and no hypersynchronized EEG. Here we show that the mh(2J) mutation is due to an IAP element insertion in the Ap3d gene leading to a C-terminally truncated protein. Despite correct assembly of the AP-3 complex and localization to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, AP-3 function in neurons remains impaired. While mh mice show a severe reduction of vesicular zinc (TIMM staining) owing to mislocalization and degradation of the Zinc transporter ZnT-3, the TIMM and ZnT-3 staining patterns in mh(2J) varies, with normal expression in hippocampal mossy fibers, but abnormal patterns in neocortex. These results indicate that the N-terminal portion of the delta subunit is sufficient for AP-3 complex assembly and subcellular localization to the TGN/endosomes, while subsequent function is regulated in part by cell-specific interactions with the C-terminal portion.",M2
12576321,"Cappuccino, a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, encodes a novel protein that is part of the pallidin-muted complex (BLOC-1).Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a disorder of organelle biogenesis affecting 3 related organelles-melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and lysosomes. Four genes causing HPS in humans (HPS1-HPS4) are known, and at least 15 nonallelic mutations cause HPS in the mouse. Where their functions are known, the HPS-associated proteins are involved in some aspect of intracellular vesicular trafficking, that is, protein sorting and vesicle docking and fusion. Biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the HPS-associated genes encode components of at least 3 distinct protein complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3; the HPS1/HPS4 complex; and BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1), consisting of the proteins encoded at 2 mouse HPS loci, pallid (pa) and muted (mu), and at least 3 other unidentified proteins. Here, we report the cloning of the mouse HPS mutation cappuccino (cno). We show that the wild-type cno gene encodes a novel, ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that coassembles with pallidin and the muted protein in the BLOC-1 complex. Further, we identify a frameshift mutation in mutant cno/cno mice. The C-terminal 81 amino acids are replaced with 72 different amino acids in the mutant CNO protein, and its ability to interact in BLOC-1 is abolished. We performed mutation screening of patients with HPS and failed to identify any CNO defects. Notably, although defects in components of the HPS1/HPS4 and the AP-3 complexes are associated with HPS in humans, no defects in the known components of BLOC-1 have been identified in 142 patients with HPS screened to date, suggesting that BLOC-1 function may be critical in humans.",M2
12548288,"Ru2 and Ru encode mouse orthologs of the genes mutated in human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome types 5 and 6.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving abnormalities of melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. Here we have used positional candidate and transgenic rescue approaches to identify the genes mutated in ruby-eye 2 and ruby-eye mice (ru2 and ru, respectively), two 'mimic' mouse models of HPS. We also show that these genes are orthologs of the genes mutated in individuals with HPS types 5 and 6, respectively, and that their protein products directly interact. Both genes are previously unknown and are found only in higher eukaryotes, and together represent a new class of genes that have evolved in higher organisms to govern the synthesis of highly specialized lysosome-related organelles.",M2
12538872,"The mouse organellar biogenesis mutant buff results from a mutation in Vps33a, a homologue of yeast vps33 and Drosophila carnation.In the mouse, more than 16 loci are associated with mutant phenotypes that include defective pigmentation, aberrant targeting of lysosomal enzymes, prolonged bleeding, and immunodeficiency, the result of defective biogenesis of cytoplasmic organelles: melanosomes, lysosomes, and various storage granules. Many of these mouse mutants are homologous to the human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and Griscelli syndrome. We have mapped and positionally cloned one of these mouse loci, buff (bf), which has a mutant phenotype similar to that of human HPS. Mouse bf results from a mutation in Vps33a and thus is homologous to the yeast vacuolar protein-sorting mutant vps33 and Drosophila carnation (car). This is the first found defect of the class C vacuole/prevacuole-associated target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (t-SNARE) complex in mammals and the first mammalian mutant found that is directly homologous to a vps mutation of yeast. VPS33A thus is a good candidate gene for a previously uncharacterized form of human HPS.",M2
12453182,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome: vesicle formation from yeast to man.The disorders known as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) are a group of genetic diseases resulting from abnormal formation of intracellular vesicles. In HPS, dysfunction of melanosomes results in oculocutaneous albinism, and absence of platelet dense bodies causes a bleeding diathesis. In addition, some HPS patients suffer granulomatous colitis or fatal pulmonary fibrosis, perhaps due to mistrafficking of a subset of lysosomes. The impaired function of specific organelles indicates that the causative genes encode proteins operative in the formation of certain vesicles. Four such genes, HPS1, ADTB3A, HPS3, and HPS4, are associated with the four known subtypes of HPS, i.e. HPS-1, HPS-2, HPS-3, and HPS-4. ADTB3A codes for the beta 3 A subunit of adaptor complex-3, known to assist in vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network or late endosome. However, the functions of the HPS1, HPS3, and HPS4 gene products remain unknown. These three genes arose with the evolution of mammals and have no homologs in yeast, reflecting their specialized function. In contrast, all four known HPS-causing genes have homologs in mice, a species with 14 different models of HPS, i.e. hypopigmentation and a platelet storage pool deficiency. Pursuit of the mechanism of mammalian vesicle formation and trafficking, impaired in HPS, relies upon investigation of these mouse models as well as studies of protein complexes involved in yeast vacuole formation.",M2
12442288,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1: gene organization, novel mutations, and clinical-molecular review of non-Puerto Rican cases.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing oculocutaneous albinism and a platelet storage pool deficiency, reflecting defective biosynthesis and/or processing of melanosomes and platelet dense bodies. Four human genes (HPS1, ADTB3A, HPS3, HPS4) are associated with four subtypes of HPS. The most common is HPS-1. A 16-bp duplication in exon 15 of the HPS1 gene causes HPS-1 in 450 northwest Puerto Rican patients; 13 other HPS1 mutations have been reported in non-Puerto Rican patients. We screened 26 HPS patients, who lacked a molecular diagnosis, for HPS1 defects and identified six patients with six different HPS1 mutations. Four novel mutations were discovered, including the first HPS1 missense mutation, 922T&gt;C, in exon 8. This mutation, along with 624delG in exon 6, preserve RNA transcription, while 561delC in exon 5 and [1581delA;1594C&gt;A] in exon 14 produce no RNA on northern blot. One of six adult patients developed pulmonary fibrosis, and two patients ages 16 and 17 have granulomatous colitis. These complications are common among Puerto Rican HPS-1 patients but have not appeared in HPS-2 or HPS-3 patients. The diagnosis of HPS-1, available only on molecular grounds, has important prognostic and treatment implications.",M2

The genes that are defective in each of the different forms of HPS in humans, or in HPS-like disorders in mice, are thought to encode components of a putative molecular machinery required for the formation of specialized organelles of the lysosomal system.

12126938,"Effect of pirfenidone on the pulmonary fibrosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) consists of oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool deficiency and, in patients with HPS1 gene mutations, a progressive, fatal pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated the safety and efficacy of an antifibrotic agent, pirfenidone (800 mg, t.i.d.), in treating 21 adult Puerto Rican HPS patients, including 20 homozygous for the same HPS1 mutation. Patients were examined every 4 months for up to 44 months in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with rate of change in pulmonary function values as outcome parameters. Using the complete data set of 130 patient admissions, a repeated measures model showed that 11 pirfenidone-treated patients lost FVC at a rate 5% of predicted ( approximately 400 mL) per year slower than 10 placebo-treated patients (p=0.001). A random coefficients model showed no significant difference. However, using data restricted to patients with an initial FVC &gt;50% of predicted, both models showed the pirfenidone group losing FVC (p&lt;0.022), FEV(1) (p&lt;0.0007), TLC (p&lt;0.001), and DL(CO) (p&lt;0.122) at a rate approximately 8%/year slower than the placebo group. Clinical and laboratory side effects were similar in the two groups. Pirfenidone appears to slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in HPS patients who have significant residual lung function.",M2
12125811,"Disorders of vesicles of lysosomal lineage: the Hermansky-Pudlak syndromes.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) has evolved into a group of genetically distinct disorders characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a storage pool deficiency, and impaired formation or trafficking of intracellular vesicles. HPS-1 results from mutations in the HPS1 gene and affects approximately 400 individuals in northwest Puerto Rico due to a 16-bp duplication in exon 15. Another 13 mutations have been reported in non-Puerto Ricans. HPS1 codes for a 79.3 kDa cytoplasmic protein of unknown function. HPS-1 patients typically develop fatal pulmonary fibrosis in their fourth decade. HPS-2 is caused by mutations in ADTB3A, which codes for the beta3A subunit of the adaptor protein-3 complex, AP3. This coat protein complex has been localized to the TGN as well as to a peripheral endosomal compartment. Evidence indicates that AP3 plays a role in the stepwise process of vesicular trafficking which leads to formation of the melanosomal, platelet dense body and lysosomal compartments. All three known HPS-2 patients had childhood neutropenia and infections. HPS-3 results from mutations in HPS3 and affects central Puerto Ricans homozygous for a 3904-bp deletion removing exon 1. At least 8 non-Puerto Rican patients have other HPS3 mutations, including an IVS5+1G-&gt;A splicing mutation in five Ashkenazi Jewish patients. HPS3 codes for a 113.7 kDa protein of unknown function. HPS-3 manifests with mild hypopigmentation and bleeding. All types of HPS are diagnosed by whole mount electron microscopic demonstration of absent platelet dense bodies, and molecular diagnoses are available for the Puerto Rican HPS1 and HPS3 founder mutations. Mouse and Drosophila models provide candidates for new genes causing HPS in humans. These genes will reveal the pathways by which specialized vesicles of lysosomal lineage arise within cells.",M2
12070017,"The regulation of platelet-dense granules by Rab27a in the ashen mouse, a model of Hermansky-Pudlak and Griscelli syndromes, is granule-specific and dependent on genetic background.The ashen (ash) mouse, a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) and for a subset of patients with Griscelli syndrome, presents with hypopigmentation, prolonged bleeding times, and platelet storage pool deficiency due to a mutation which abrogates expression of the Rab27a protein. Platelets of mice with the ashen mutation on the C3H/HeSnJ inbred strain background have greatly reduced amounts of dense granule components such as serotonin and adenine nucleotides though near-normal numbers of dense granules as enumerated by the dense granule-specific fluorescent dye mepacrine. Thus, essentially normal numbers of platelet dense granules are produced but the granule interiors are abnormal. Collagen-mediated aggregation of mutant platelets is significantly depressed. No abnormalities in the concentrations or secretory rates of 2 other major platelet granules, lysosomes and alpha granules, were apparent. Similarly, no platelet ultrastructural alterations other than those involving dense granules were detected. Therefore, Rab27a regulates the synthesis and secretion of only one major platelet organelle, the dense granule. There were likewise no mutant effects on levels or secretion of lysosomal enzymes of several other tissues. Together with other recent analyses of the ashen mouse, these results suggest a close relationship between platelet dense granules, melanosomes of melanocytes and secretory lysosomes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, all mediated by Rab27a. Surprisingly, the effects of the ashen mutation on platelet-dense granule components, platelet aggregation, and bleeding times were highly dependent on genetic background. This suggests that bleeding tendencies may likewise vary among patients with Griscelli syndrome and HPS with Rab27a mutations.",M2
12009785,"Pulmonary pathologies in pallid mice result from nonhematopoietic defects.Several single gene pigment mutants of inbred C57BL/6J mice display a triad of subcellular granule-associated defects: oculocutaneous pigment dilution, prolonged bleeding due to defects in platelet dense granules, and abnormal lysosomes. These features also characterize Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), making these mice relevant animal models for HPS. Mice of one mutant strain, pallid, in addition to the hallmark triad of signs, also exhibit age-dependent lung pathology. Respiratory system mechanics showed that the age-dependent histopathology of pallid mice was accompanied by a decrease in lung reactance. Furthermore, the possibility that pallid pulmonary pathology may result from persistent inflammation due to microhemorrhage owing to the platelet defect was examined. Hematopoietic reconstitution of pallid mice with marrow from normal C57BL/6J donors did not prevent the development of the pulmonary histopathology or respiratory system mechanics characteristic of the pallid genotype. Similarly, wild-type mice 12 months after engraftment with pallid marrow did not develop pallid-like pulmonary histopathology or respiratory system mechanics. Thus, pallid-associated pulmonary functional and structural pathologies are not linked to the marrow (bleeding) genotype, but instead are the result of an age-dependent process resulting from a defect(s) in one or more nonhematopoietic cell types.",M2
12008957,"Role of the PAR4 thrombin receptor in stabilizing platelet-platelet aggregates as revealed by a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.Individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) lack platelet dense granules and have no ADP-autocrine response. Despite these platelet deficiencies, HPS patients exhibit a surprisingly mild bleeding phenotype. We hypothesize that activation of the PAR4 thrombin receptor compensates for the lack of an ADP-autocrine response by the P2Y12 ADP receptor in individuals with HPS. Here, we determine that PAR4 activation by thrombin occurs well after ADP release from dense granules in normal individuals. However, the signal from PAR4 stabilizes platelet-platelet aggregate formation in the absence of P2Y12 activation by ADP. Thus, the strong signal emanating from PAR4 during platelet aggregation would provide an explanation for the mild bleeding diathesis of HPS.",M2

This retrospective study reviews the clinical history and haematological features of 23 cases of HPS. Information was gathered from patient notes and by direct interview. Thirteen of the 23 children were of Turkish origin, 12 being members of four kindreds from the Turkish/Kurdish border. Four children originated from Pakistan. Haemorrhage was uncommon; two experienced significant bleeding (intracranial and retinal haemorrhage in one and menorrhagia in another), and twelve minor symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation of platelet function were not predictive of bleeding; in particular the PFA-100 analyser was not sensitive to the HPS defect. The most sensitive test of platelet fuction was quantitation of platelet nucleotides.

11912185,"The gene for the muted (mu) mouse, a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, defines a novel protein which regulates vesicle trafficking.The muted (mu) mouse is a model for Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (<e>HPS</e>), an inherited disorder of humans causing hypopigmentation, hemorrhaging and early death due to lung abnormalities. The mu gene regulates the synthesis of specialized mammalian organelles such as melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. Further, balance defects indicate that it controls the synthesis of otoliths of the inner ear. The mu gene has been identified by a positional/candidate approach involving large mouse interspecific backcrosses. It encodes a novel ubiquitously expressed transcript, specifying a predicted 185 amino acid protein, whose expression is abrogated in the mu allele which contains an insertion of an early transposon (ETn) retrotransposon. Expression is likewise expected to be lost in the mu( J) allele which contains a deletion of a single base pair within the coding region. The presence of structurally aberrant melanosomes within the eyes of mutant mice together with localization of the muted protein within vesicles in both the cell body and dendrites of transfected melan-a melanocytes emphasizes the role of the mu gene in vesicle trafficking. The mu gene is present only in mice and humans among analyzed genomes. As is true for several other recently identified mouse HPS genes, the mu gene is absent in lower eukaryotes. Therefore, the mu gene is a member of the novel gene set that has evolved in higher eukaryotes to regulate the synthesis/function of highly specialized subcellular organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules.",M2
11836498,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is caused by mutations in HPS4, the human homolog of the mouse light-ear gene.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a disorder of organelle biogenesis in which oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding and pulmonary fibrosis result from defects of melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. HPS is common in Puerto Rico, where it is caused by mutations in the genes HPS1 and, less often, HPS3 (ref. 8). In contrast, only half of non-Puerto Rican individuals with HPS have mutations in HPS1 (ref. 9), and very few in HPS3 (ref. 10). In the mouse, more than 15 loci manifest mutant phenotypes similar to human HPS, including pale ear (ep), the mouse homolog of HPS1 (refs 13,14). Mouse ep has a phenotype identical to another mutant, light ear (le), which suggests that the human homolog of le is a possible human HPS locus. We have identified and found mutations of the human le homolog, HPS4, in a number of non-Puerto Rican individuals with HPS, establishing HPS4 as an important HPS locus in humans. In addition to their identical phenotypes, le and ep mutant mice have identical abnormalities of melanosomes, and in transfected melanoma cells the HPS4 and HPS1 proteins partially co-localize in vesicles of the cell body. In addition, the HPS1 protein is absent in tissues of le mutant mice. These results suggest that the HPS4 and HPS1 proteins may function in the same pathway of organelle biogenesis.",M2

The disorder is genetically heterogeneous. The majority of patients, including members of a large genetic isolate in northwest Puerto Rico, have mutations in HPS1. Another gene, ADTB3A, was shown to cause HPS-2 in two brothers having compound heterozygous mutations that allowed for residual production of the gene product, the beta3A subunit of adaptor complex-3 (AP-3). This heterotetrameric complex serves as a coat protein-mediating formation of intracellular vesicles, e.g. the melanosome and platelet dense body, from membranes of the trans-Golgi network. We determined the genomic organization of the human ADTB3A gene, with intron/exon boundaries, and describe a third patient with beta3A deficiency. This 5-y-old boy has two nonsense mutations, C1578T (R--&gt;X) and G2028T (E--&gt;X), which produce no ADTB3A mRNA and no beta3A protein. The associated mu3 subunit of AP-3 is also entirely absent. In fibroblasts, the cell biologic concomitant of this deficiency is robust and aberrant trafficking through the plasma membrane of LAMP-3, an integral lysosomal membrane protein normally carried directly to the lysosome. The clinical concomitant is a severe, G-CSF-responsive neutropenia in addition to oculocutaneous albinism and platelet storage pool deficiency. Our findings expand the molecular, cellular, and clinical spectrum of HPS-2 and call for an increased index of suspicion for this diagnosis among patients with features of albinism, bleeding, and neutropenia.",M2

In addition to exhibiting considerable phenotypic variation, this autosomal recessive disorder displays locus heterogeneity. One causative gene is HPS1, coding for a protein of unknown function and resulting in HPS-1 disease, common in northwest Puerto Rico. A second HPS-causing gene is ADTB3A, coding for the beta3A subunit of adaptor complex-3 (AP-3, a coat protein complex) and resulting in HPS-2 disease. Each of these HPS subtypes has a murine counterpart, specifically pale ear for HPS-1 and pearl for HPS-2. Recently, the HPS3 gene, responsible for HPS-3 disease in a genetic isolate of central Puerto Rico, was isolated and characterized. Its location on human chromosome 3q24 suggested that the mouse model corresponding to HPS-3 disease might be subtle gray. To examine this possibility, we determined the mouse HPS3 sequence, its genomic organization, and its amino acid sequence, which shares 95.8% identity with the human protein. We demonstrated that the subtle gray mouse produces a normal size and amount of HPS3 mRNA and has an entirely normal sequence in every exon and intron/exon boundary. Furthermore, subtle gray exhibits a normal contingent of platelet dense bodies. Together, these data eliminate subtle gray as a murine model for HPS-3 disease and suggest that other mouse models be examined.",M2

HPS1 mutations cause HPS-1 disease, and ADTB3A mutations cause HPS-2 disease, which is known to involve abnormal intracellular vesicle formation. A third HPS-causing gene, HPS3, was recently identified on the basis of homozygosity mapping of a genetic isolate of HPS in central Puerto Rico. We now describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of eight patients with HPS-3 who are of non-Puerto Rican heritage. Five are Ashkenazi Jews; three of these are homozygous for a 1303+1G--&gt;A splice-site mutation that causes skipping of exon 5, deleting an RsaI restriction site and decreasing the amounts of mRNA found on northern blotting. The other two are heterozygous for the 1303+1G--&gt;A mutation and for either an 1831+2T--&gt;G or a 2621-2A--&gt;G splicing mutation. Of 235 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, one was heterozygous for the 1303+1G--&gt;A mutation. One seven-year-old boy of German/Swiss extraction was compound heterozygous for a 2729+1G--&gt;C mutation, causing skipping of exon 14, and resulting in a C1329T missense (R396W), with decreased mRNA production. A 15-year-old Irish/English boy was heterozygous for an 89-bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 resulting from abnormal splicing; his fibroblast HPS3 mRNA is normal in amount but is increased in size. A 12-year-old girl of Puerto Rican and Italian background has the 3,904-bp founder deletion from central Puerto Rico on one allele. All eight patients have mild symptoms of HPS; two Jewish patients had received the diagnosis of ocular, rather than oculocutaneous, albinism. These findings expand the molecular diagnosis of HPS, provide a screening method for a mutation common among Jews, and suggest that other patients with mild hypopigmentation and decreased vision should be examined for HPS.",M2

In addition, HPS exhibits ceroid lipofuscinosis and CHS is characterized by infections and an accelerated phase. The two disorders result from defects in vesicles of lysosomal lineage. Of the two known HPS-causing genes, HPS1 has no recognizable function, while ADTB3A codes for a subunit of an adaptor complex responsible for new vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network. Other HPS-causing genes are likely to exist. The only known CHS-causing gene, LYST, codes for a large protein of unknown function. In general, HPS appears to be a disorder of vesicle formation and CHS a defect in vesicle trafficking. These diseases and their variants mirror a group of mouse hypopigmentation mutants. The gene productsinvolved will reveal how the melanosome, platelet dense body, and lysosome are formed and trafficked within cells.",M2
11455388,"Mutation of a new gene causes a unique form of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in a genetic isolate of central Puerto Rico.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a storage pool deficiency due to an absence of platelet dense bodies. Lysosomal ceroid lipofuscinosis, pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis are occasional manifestations of the disease. HPS occurs with a frequency of one in 1800 in north-west Puerto Rico due to a founder effect. Several non-Puerto Rican patients also have mutations in HPS1, which produces a protein of unknown function. Another gene, ADTB3A, causes HPS in the pearl mouse and in two brothers with HPS-2 (refs. 11,12). ADTB3A encodes a coat protein involved in vesicle formation, implicating HPS as a disorder of membrane trafficking. We sought to identify other HPS-causing genes. Using homozygosity mapping on pooled DNA of 6 families from central Puerto Rico, we localized a new HPS susceptibility gene to a 1.6-cM interval on chromosome 3q24. The gene, HPS3, has 17 exons, and a putative 113.7-kD product expected to reveal how new vesicles form in specialized cells. The homozygous, disease-causing mutation is a large deletion and represents the second example of a founder mutation causing HPS on the small island of Puerto Rico. We also present an allele-specific assay for diagnosing individuals heterozygous or homozygous for this mutation.",M2
11452004,"AP-3 mediates tyrosinase but not TRP-1 trafficking in human melanocytes.Patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (<e>HPS</e>-2) have mutations in the beta 3A subunit of adaptor complex-3 (AP-3) and functional deficiency of this complex. AP-3 serves as a coat protein in the formation of new vesicles, including, apparently, the platelet's dense body and the melanocyte's melanosome. We used HPS-2 melanocytes in culture to determine the role of AP-3 in the trafficking of the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1). TRP-1 displayed a typical melanosomal pattern in both normal and HPS-2 melanocytes. In contrast, tyrosinase exhibited a melanosomal (i.e., perinuclear and dendritic) pattern in normal cells but only a perinuclear pattern in the HPS-2 melanocytes. In addition, tyrosinase exhibited a normal pattern of expression in HPS-2 melanocytes transfected with a cDNA encoding the beta 3A subunit of the AP-3 complex. This suggests a role for AP-3 in the normal trafficking of tyrosinase to premelanosomes, consistent with the presence of a dileucine recognition signal in the C-terminal portion of the tyrosinase molecule. In the AP-3-deficient cells, tyrosinase was also present in structures resembling late endosomes or multivesicular bodies; these vesicles contained exvaginations devoid of tyrosinase. This suggests that, under normal circumstances, AP-3 may act on multivesicular bodies to form tyrosinase-containing vesicles destined to fuse with premelanosomes. Finally, our studies demonstrate that tyrosinase and TRP-1 use different mechanisms to reach their premelanosomal destination.",M2
11414528,"DNA diagnosis and management of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in pregnancy.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), platelet storage pool deficiency, and ceroid lipofuscin deposition. Sequelae including pulmonary fibrosis, colitis, and hemorrhagic diathesis can impact obstetric management. An 18-year-old primigravida with OCA was diagnosed during pregnancy with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome by DNA analysis. Uneventful vaginal delivery occurred at term following prophylactic platelet transfusion. Women of northwestern Puerto Rican descent with OCA should be offered testing for HPS. Identification of affected individuals may permit optimal obstetric management.",M2
11381862,"Cutaneous malignancy in albinism.Albinism is a disorder of hypopigmentation affecting the skin, appendages, and eyes. Ultraviolet light-induced cutaneous tumors are common in patients with albinism due to reduced or absent protection from melanin. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the number one skin tumor seen in patients who are albinos. Although nonmelanomatous skin cancers are more common in patients with albinism, dysplastic nevus and melanoma present a greater diagnostic challenge in this group because of their hypopigmented appearance. We report 2 cases of cutaneous malignancies in patients who had oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). The first case involves a 45-year-old man with OCA type 2 (OCA2) who developed a large SCC of the neck. The second case involves a 24-year-old man with Hermansky-Pudiak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) who developed amelanotic melanoma. In both cases, hypopigmentation of the lesions contributed to a delay in diagnosis. We review the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic concerns for patients with albinism who have cutaneous malignancies.",M2
11208073,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and related disorders of organelle formation.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>) consists of a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders which share the clinical findings of oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool deficiency, and some degree of ceroid lipofuscinosis. Related diseases share some of these findings and may exhibit other symptoms and signs but the underlying defect in the entire group of disorders involves defective intracellular vesicle formation, transport or fusion. Two HPS-causing genes, HPS1 and ADTB3A, have been isolated but the function of only the latter has been determined. ADTB3A codes for the beta 3A subunit of adaptor complex-3, responsible for vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The many HPS patients who do not have HPS1 or ADTB3A mutations have their disease because of mutations in other genes. Candidates for these HPS-causing genes include those responsible for mouse models of HPS or for the 'granule' group of eye color genes in Drosophila. Each gene responsible for a subset of HPS or a related disorder codes for a protein which almost certainly plays a pivotal role in vesicular trafficking, inextricably linking clinical and cell biological interests in this group of diseases.",M2
11110696,"Defects in the cappuccino (cno) gene on mouse chromosome 5 and human 4p cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome by an AP-3-independent mechanism.Defects in a triad of organelles (melanosomes, platelet granules, and lysosomes) result in albinism, prolonged bleeding, and lysosome abnormalities in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (<e>HPS</e>). Defects in HPS1, a protein of unknown function, and in components of the AP-3 complex cause some, but not all, cases of HPS in humans. There have been 15 inherited models of HPS described in the mouse, underscoring its marked genetic heterogeneity. Here we characterize a new spontaneous mutation in the mouse, cappuccino (cno), that maps to mouse chromosome 5 in a region conserved with human 4p15-p16. Melanosomes of cno/cno mice are immature and dramatically decreased in number in the eye and skin, resulting in severe oculocutaneous albinism. Platelet dense body contents (adenosine triphosphate, serotonin) are markedly deficient, leading to defective aggregation and prolonged bleeding. Lysosomal enzyme concentrations are significantly elevated in the kidney and liver. Genetic, immunofluorescence microscopy, and lysosomal protein trafficking studies indicate that the AP-3 complex is intact in cno/cno mice. It was concluded that the cappuccino gene encodes a product involved in an AP-3-independent mechanism critical to the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. (Blood. 2000;96:4227-4235)",M2
